B00367NFKG|5|This became unglued as soon as it was put on the main keychain! I would not choose this item again! ***Update*** on 8/28/2015: After this review was posted, a few weeks later, the company sent me a new keychain- this time in excellent condition! I have changed my mind about this company and I appreciate them taking the time to review my complaint. I love this keychain! Thank you so much!!
B007ZHMOC8|4|Worked great for my car remote entry. The bottom plastic piece had broken- which made it impossible to put on my keyring- so this held it on. Also added a cute pink color to my keyring. Does bulk up your remote entry a bit but I don't mind
B00CUOTAA0|5|Good product and fast shipment, Thank you!
B00G9W9H2U|5|Well made, and a great solution for those of us who cannot roll a sleeping bag tight enough to fit in the original sleeping bag carrier.  I have two of these for our winter super thick bags.The handle is also much more comfortable to carry than pull strings.
B004QMB20A|1|Order a bazillion sizes smaller in these pants.  I ordered the large size because it corresponded with the measurements on the size chart, which would have been one size larger than my husband currently owned.  That made sense because he had gained some weight and his current pants were a bit too small.  When they arrived they were huge.  I contacted the seller and exchanged them for the next smaller size.  He said at the time that the pants I returned were sewn to size.  The new pants in the medium are still HUGE.  Right now it's been a waste of money.  My husband lost a bit of weight and is now wearing his old pants because these are so uncomfortable due to their GIANT size.
B000IYIUD2|5|corrected my cruise-control problem.
B007LICGWY|3|This is ok, but it doesn't have clips at the bottom to hold it snug to the plate, so there is a lot of rattling. These [[ASIN:B00E1ETJNU Grand General 60439 Matte Black Powder Coated License Plate Frame with 2 Holes]] are a better buy.
B00JS6PTFS|4|Difficult to set on/off & color sequence on lights!
B00I3E2558|5|These are replacements for mats which came out of my 2001 Ford and worked well in my 2004 until a kid cleaning my truck doused the old ones in WD-40 which made them unusable as they were too slick to be able to even get into my truck. These are excellent for traction.
B007Y85VB4|1|This product was ordered and when I received it the mechanic installed it in my car ( 2000 Infiniti G20 ) and it did not work. My battery was spanking brand new however the Alternator was announced useless and powerless to help start my car. I had to go through all the trouble installing it and un-installing it to send a useless alternator back. I end up purchasing a brand new alternator at Auto Zone for 50 dollars more. My car is running now.
B002G2U0VE|5|great stuff.  wouldn't use anything else.
B0091OE6II|5|great for short people
B008YJLHOW|5|excellent product  On time deliver  easy install
B00ARUPXTQ|4|Purchased for a 2004 Ford F150  Lariat.  Both the fit and quality exceed my expectations.  I recommend these for your truck!
B00EA0ZB7I|3|A bit disappointed... The color of the light output doesn't match.
B00DQJ9GWU|4|Its everything you've read already about this little antenna. The difference between this and the other small antennas Ive looked at is this one is a solid piece of metal an not a metal base with rubber top, which is good since its not going to be falling over after a few months. Some FM channels lost the &#34;HD&#34; setting in my 2014 Tacoma after installing it. I use XM most of the time so its more about the height of the antenna/ Im tired of hitting branches with it
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great tire gauge!  Will buy again.
B0003041WK|2|I understand that the product is very good. However, I cannot tell the merits or deficiencies of the product, as the can has no nozzle. The seller refuses to send me a nozzle.
B00062YJ4A|5|Increased my mileage by 2mpg average; and then there's the performace also!  Great product!
B0055EFU8I|5|I did a lot of research trying to find the best gauge for my SUV and Truck. This one has the pressure range I needed which I found to be the most accurate. The glow in the dark face has helped a few times since most places where you buy air from are not as well lit as the pump stations. I also find that the gauges attached to the fill station are never accurate.<br /><br />The absolute best feature for me is that it holds the pressure reading so you can read it at eye level or see it better in the light. If there is to much air in your tire just press the button and release as much as you need accurately.<br /><br />I really had a hard time justifying the cost of it until I had it in my hands. Now, I don't do any trips or off roading without it!<br /><br />If your eye sight is not as perfect anymore the numbers and lines on the gauge are very large and easy to read!
B000GTZ546|5|Good quality product at a good price
B000CIXOAI|5|Great replacement for OE mufflers on Grand Prix GXP.  Sounds stock!
B000BUU5XQ|5|Haven't used them yet, but looking forward to it. They will work perfectly though.

B00B5V57RO|1|I thought $39.99 was a good deal but the Helmet I received had no drop down shield and of course no 2nd shield as described.  I read the description twice then saved it in my wish list for a few days. Hopefully an honest mistake/ mix up with old stock?. I sent it back and chose the replacement option offered by Amazon. I will update this review when the new one with drop down shield arrives.  AFCS Advanced fiberglass composite shell for your safety see below 2 Shell sizes to ensure good fit Revolutionary DDV drop down visor EPS liner system Push Pull retractible high definition shield system Easy change shield system with many optional high definition shields Chin Strap Mechanism Double D Clear shield installed Second dark smoke shield included Meets or exceeds DOT FMVSS-218 standard Not what I received UPDATE;  Be careful what you order may not be what you receive. Today the helmet is  $62.97 & FREE Shipping and my helmet can not be replaced for some reason. Only a refund will be given or the $39.99 that can be applied to the new price in spite of the original offer to replace.  I feel I am a victim of a bait and switch. P,S, I have also been asked to drop it off at a UPS location now instead of the original home pickup ?????
B00EP0S1E8|5|It is beautiful it makes my car look good. I am happy I got it
B000IY8P46|5|Great product
B00O5UFNEO|2|The cover was the wrong size for my 2011 HD Electra Glide.
B000C5BVRO|5|Perfect fit on 2000 GT mustang
B001U7HXUW|5|Nice and easy to install and works well. I am very pleased with this item.
B0002ZVMQO|5|Great stuff at a very good price.
B00M2AVA9G|5|👍
B00VVQU2UK|4|Though I am disappointed about how tiny these are, I'm sure they work well. I thought they were bigger and would hold my large sun shade but sadly they don't.
B003AVPX6W|4|Save yourself the headache of horrible vibration and having to change the transmission mount again later. I installed all of these and wound up removing the transmission mount and replacing it with an OE rubber mount that solved the massive amount if vibration coming from the driveline and center console. I would also recommend doing the engine mounts in combination with any sort of exhaust or cylinder head project.
B003SWNVI0|4|This bag is HUGE and I was able to store about 75% of my luggage for my summer vaca. It rained the whole way and not a drop of water got through. Unfortunately it already as a small rip in it :(
B0002MB97E|5|Great I Love it.
B00C873Y60|5|good to have even if you have a 30 pound container.
B00XX3OWKA|5|Perfect decal for golf friends
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product as far exceeded my expectations.  The follow up with FAQ was a surprise and made me like this company even more
B00KOEQXDU|4|Big and heavy but rock solid. I used this as the base to mount a Garmin GPSMAP 78s into a canoe. The claw mounted on one of the aluminum cross members on a kevlar canoe perfectly. Held the GPS visible very well. A bit pricey and heavy but rock solid and worry free.
B00CAQZN7W|1|Never received items.<br />Integy stopped communicating and kept the money.
B000CNISBI|5|Being a collector of early farm engines some gaskets are hard to find for heads. this stuff works great and holds up. tried a few other materials saying they would hold under the pressure and temperature but they didnt last long well worth the time and effort
B0006MRQXG|5|No problem with this item.
B00YMUZLPS|4|Ok replacement. Works fine. Not the best quality, but good for price.
B00877SL2M|5|I love it
B00FM67O06|3|I received my key fob  and I programmed it my alarm is working I am very satisfied
B001P2X4EQ|2|Would be 5 star but no way to keep from twisting when backing up. Read on review and thought it wouldn't be a problem however it is. Every time you try to back up even a little bit it messes up the rear hitch. Fix this and it's a five-star
B0022ZSI46|5|Super simple install and made the bike look way cleaner.
B00JOVFBQ4|5|Good quality. Would buy again.
B00546EG0K|5|beautiful vest. My only complaint is that it is a tad tight.
B003CEFJ2A|3|For an item designed by highlift for a highlift you would think it would fit better you would also think you could's survive the sun and take some weather better than it has fading holesand it tough to attach but better than nothing I guess
B00Y17ANQY|5|Wow, very impressed with the construction and look of this bumper.  The LED lights are impressive! I cut the wire to the factory fog lights and wired the bumper LEDs to the factory wires. Now they work when I run on the factory fog light switch.  I would highly recommend this bumper.
B00BURPLEW|4|This product looks good, was easy to install, and worked well.  The real problem was a failed thermal fuse which I had not checked before ordering this.  That was my error and does not detract from the quality and value of this product.
B00YOF2FP0|4|Gray for the price, measure your head first
B001B5DO4C|5|Great buy for oem style clutch kit works great with a nice pressure feel
B00KYBOIGC|5|Ame<br />Works so good i give 10 all araund thanks....
B00U2Q61P0|1|One pk generally means one pack. Meaning more then one.  I was disappointed to only see a single ballast
B000A0CAC6|5|Car is humming along. A perfect fit.
B00BR9L29G|1|I regret making this purchase. The helmet I purchased was defective.
B00XNYI502|4|Cool but too small
B002WCXTRU|1|Sorry, but this is just a cheap, poorly thought out approach to replacing your emblem, that lasted all of 1 month for me.  It consists of a flimsy chrome plated plastic base and a thick 'sticker' with the BMW emblem on it that sticks to the base.  The adhesive on the sticker is not designe for summer temperatures and one 80 degree day was all it took for the adhesive to soften completely and drop the emblem on my driveway(!)  I stuck it back on but it just slides off again once the sun hits it.  If I hadn't had waited 6mths to put it on I would have returned it right away.  If you live within the arctic circle this is for you - for the rest of us, go OEM or regret it.
B00I7KDVH4|1|piece of junk didn't come with one of the snap locks, so its useless.
B00QUL6U8Y|1|arrived early...red light comes but will not connect with any of the several apps available even the paid ones!
B00HLWVEZK|1|Junk. Slipping right out of the box BURNT UP IN 10 minutes. Installed by a professional (me) DO NOT BUY
B0052OOCUI|5|Great price and easy link.
B005F9GY4M|5|Product fit right on as if it was the original product. Haven't had any problems out of it.
B00681BDXI|3|The link provided (traderbayz.com) with my original order provided incorrect information.  It said to turn switch on and off 8 time leaving it on the eighth time.  WRONG for my '02 Focus.  Four times and leaving it off worked really well.  Just like the owners manual says.  Should have read that first!!
B000C7VYWY|5|Fit car as stated works fine
B0055FFMGM|5|I am very pleased with the product
B00176FTW0|2|I done on gas mower, I like electric more
B004SEXO3E|5|Love it I have used it unfortunately a few times now but glad I bought it
B00CQAQYDE|5|It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.  The instructions were easy to follow.  The instructions said it was a two person job and I did have a helper but believe with a little ingenuity I could have done it alone.
B007REFW32|5|As a school principal had so much fun with this decal! kids loved it and made me seem more accessible and fun....
B00WH6M9OU|5|Very satisfied. Had professional installation to make sure it was no mistakes
B00JKU60Z0|4|Adhesive isn't to strong. Already peeling off the car after 3 months.
B003YD0YTM|2|It's not what I expected.
B00IJEA7IY|5|Perfect fit.
B0087NB2OU|5|They work great. Purchased them to communicate on our boat while docking.  Save a lot of yelling to each other.
B0000UUU6Y|5|Works on my truck
B00OXQY1NY|5|Perfect tank bag for a Honda Rebel. Exactly fits the tank and can hold just enough essentials, wristlet, keys, glasses, cell phone (too big for the outside pocket) and a notebook. There are also interior pockets that are useful for change and hair bands. The outside pockets for cell phones and nav systems are too small (at least for mine) but great for other items you want to keep handy, like sunglasses or gum. The included strap converts the bag to a small sling backpack, pretty convenient. The magnets hold tight and the bag doesn't slip around at all. The quality is great, I would recommend this tank bag to any rider.
B00IK4CVQ4|5|Parts arrived extremely fast and fit perfectly! This was for our 2010 Ford Fusion and it took me longer to watch the instructional video than it did to actually remove the old and install the new. These replacement trunk lifts work just as good or better as the originals when the car was new. Hopefully, these will last longer than the originals (5 years). I think it took me a total of 5 minutes to install and test. The seller (Lift Supports Depot) sent me a link to an instructional video before the parts arrived which was very helpful! Anyone with a small flathead screwdriver and 2 hands can do this as long as you make sure the trunk doesn't fall on your head!
B007GME2LI|5|Work awesome on my 2000 vulcan!
B00CZG1ZRY|5|works well, stays where you put it, I haven't had any issues with it coming off in the 3 months I've been using it.  It holds my old style EZ pass perfectly and I had no issues going through tolls.
B0006JLW84|5|We purchased this as a replacement for the vent on our enclosed trailer that was dry rotted.  It is easy to install and a perfect fit for our enclosed trailer!
B00X96RSX4|3|They fit like a glove on my 05 Tacoma Ted sport double cab 4x4 and they look great too but I had/have two issues with them #1 the adhesive for the rubber hood seals is junk I had to re adhere them and #2 they were a nightmare to aim
B004SL8568|5|Just what i needed.  Great product
B00V56U28I|5|Works great
B000FOL08M|5|Very solid bar and latch mechanism. Well-made feet grip the sides of the pickup bed securely. Can't go wrong.
B00ANZHG4U|5|GREAT FOR CLEANING WINDOWS AND DUSTING, AT A FAIR PRICE
B00KJ8JHYI|5|Smooth transaccion and easy.
B000BWAOWG|5|Cheap price for a chrome distributor hold-down. Chrome looks good but I was disappointed that the bolt was not chrome. Looks kind of odd with chrome hold-down but non-chrome bolt. I will substitute a polished SS bolt.
B000AMBOSK|4|A bit dimmer then my other which has a blue tint but still satisfied
B0096FSDTA|5|Love the look
B00WNGV0WG|5|Love this car seat travel tray! I have a two year old that always wants to be doing something so when I'm on the go now I can give him a coloring book and some crayons and he is entertained the whole car ride I have to say this is a well money spent if you have toddlers
B00BJJZMXQ|4|It showed up in great shape and was an exact fit
B000AP57OE|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00AC6VO8O|5|I plan on buying back ups for these. I don't use them as pant straps... i click them on a strap on my boots that cover the top of my for and they are so perfect!
B001FEISS6|5|Perfect！！！！！
B006YWYCVG|5|Fit our Poulon rider.  Easy to install.
B000BWCFSC|5|Fit perfect, didnt leak and its chrome.
B009WM81V2|5|Satisfied
B0009VIPYI|5|Great little tool to have.
B009NP4N24|2|none of these fix a 1995 mustang 3.8L that was the question I asked before ordering and the answers I received said that one would work for a 95 mustang 3.8L
B003X3M9IW|5|If I could give this product - and the company's GREAT customer service - a 10 star rating, I absolutely would!! This bumper protector is the real deal; it is made of solid steel, exactly as described and unless a trailor rides over it I can not imagine it bending or breaking. In addition to that, which is actually what initially caught my eye, it has great style and therefore does not look ugly and stiff on my car; I regularly get comments on how cool it looks! This is my first lease and I have a sweet little sports car, so the last thing I wanted to do was ugly it up. I live in Brooklyn and people around here really park horribly; they couldn't care less what happens to the next person's car so I was searching all over for the right bumper protector until I finally found this one! I bought the set: 4Bumpers Prime and 4Bumpers Duo. I recommend you do the same!!!! A few of my friends have purchased the set as well, after seeing it on my car :).<br /><br />Now. Regarding customer service -- Wow. I am majorly impressed! I had some questions and was concerned about receiving the right information. I left a voicemail and within 1/2 hour received a call back from Jeff and he went out of his way to answer all my questions and make sure I walked away as a very satisfied customer! If you have any hesitation, just call them and leave a voicemail if you don't reach anyone - you WILL receive a call back and all your questions will be answered, and more!!<br /><br />As for my experience with the product so far (I purchase it a few months ago, just never had the chance to write this review until now) I already have a number of scuff marks on the rubber part of the protector -- which automatically tells me that had those protectors not been there, I would have had those scuff marks on my car, plus definitely some scratches and dents which these bumper protectors prevented from happening! I've also found a car in front of me totally backed into my car but the bumper protector stopped him from touching my actual bumper! I attaching a photo of some the scuff marks so you could see what I'm talking about, as well as the one where the car was totally backed into me. A cool option you have is that you could remove the rubber parts and just keep the metal as is, or even sharpen it, and when someone touches your car they're just gonna damage their own car! I was actually concerned whether the weight will be too heavy for my front and back bumpers, but it is just fine. I even verified with my dealership whether lots of driving will wear off the screw area and they said it won't. So far so good!<br /><br />Don't hesitate --- order yours now! I'm a big fan. :) Good luck and drive safely!ped him from touching my actual bumper!

B00USC2CEW|5|Love this light extremely good quality and factory sealed
B000CAINDE|5|Great!
B009AA4R14|5|Seems good so far fit well on my car
B000CSRA1C|5|Great fit, service and would and have recommended to others.
B00407NK6A|4|I tried fixingmy own ding
B012X49ENY|5|We just got a new vehicle and one of the things we have vowed to do was keep it neat and organized, unlike our old one.  We have purchased a few items to try to help with this but the most useful, and unique, so far is this P&F Wingback car organizer.  This installs easily and quickly between the two front seats and doesn't get in the way of the center console at all.  It allows us to keep phones, wallets and other loose items stored and within easy reach.  Love this organizer and will likely be buying another one soon.
B00J5KRUHM|5|This thing is huge.  Takes up all the space on the floor between the dash and console in my CRV.  It's solid, well made, and will be a breeze to clean.  It took a minute to figure out how to get the stabilizers in (slightly bend), but being a rocket scientist I got it done quickly.  I could sink a jump shot in this so I think it will adequately manage goldfish packages, snotty Kleenex and Starbucks cups.
B00XULVDHK|5|Love the shades. Very easy to install.  I was afraid that I would forget they were there and roll down the back windows, which that is exactly what happened. I was sure it would have been ruined or lost between my door, but not so!  They are thin enough and hold strong enough so that wouldn't happen. The suction cups are nice to have, but not needed.  Customer service with Jomolly is fantastic.  Not only did they e-mail me before I received the shades to let me know what do to if the suction cups were not straight, but when I had a question, they were very quick to answer.  I would highly recommend these and also dealing with Jomolly.
B0002JMQ24|5|This glass cleaner is the best I have found. I have a 65 Chevrolet with a mostly plastic & vinyl interior. The interior glass surfaces get a film that I could never completely remove. A friend in the detailing business suggested this 3M product. It is truly amazing. My windows are now crystal clear and no streaks.
B0068TYFFS|5|love it
B007DD4M3S|5|As described
B009X23B2U|5|Switch panel fits good and matches interior well
B000E7SY0C|3|I ordered this rack because of the reviews and cost against suggestions of peers who have other racks. I wasn't going to be using it all of the time so I had a hard time dropping serious money for a higher quality rack.  I ordered it for a multi state vacation with the family and ordered it a month before I had to go.  With my job I get shipped all over the place with very little notice for extended periods of time.  So of course I got shipped out and got back two days before vacation.  My girlfriend brought the rack to my house in only the manufacturers box, she said the one it came in was in shreds and pieces and wasn't even on the box (manufacturers box).  The manufacturers box was beat to hell as well with pieces of the rack protruding from it.  The pieces that were sticking out were end pieces and the plastic plugs were in pieces.  I was leaving with no time to get it returned or buy a new one, so I decided to roll with it.  I liked the simplicity of the design, instructions are clear.  I put it on the back of my truck and love the idea that it will tilt down and allow you to put the tailgate down.  This is impossible when it's fully loaded with bikes unless you have some kind of super human strength or anger issues.  My bike is tricky to get on but once it's on it fits nice and rides nice, I have a Scott 29er.  My girls bikes- forget it.  One has a small mountain bike, cheaper Walmart type, had to hang it with only one post going through the frame and the other rides a BMX, the only way to get it on was upside down.  There is no room to put a fourth bike on, unless you had bikes the same size or road bikes.  The rack does wobble a lot when fully loaded, to fix that I ran some ratchet straps from the carrier to the top of the canopy on my truck.  The lock feature is nice but it has already broken. Over all, it's just okay- you get what you pay for
B001LV9FY4|5|Still looks great on my Chevy!
B002692308|5|Excellent item for our truck, easy purchase, quick delivery, and very easy installation. Also price and no shipping was excellent. Delivery was very fast. Completely satisfied!
B009PJJGDY|1|Wow!  Aluminum can quality in this product.  It fits but you can't use it very well because it bends all over the place.  Very poor design.
B000NU60P6|5|Just what I needed
B000C5WCN6|1|After installing in 2000 honda civic, Car started burning lot of gas and hesitation. Now going to honda dealer for honda sensor
B008RLSNJY|5|fits great
B0085IH6LK|4|Complete brake assembly, easy to install. Very happy
B00RUECG9M|5|I was worried about it being flimsy but the billed aluminum was actually pretty heavy duty.
B00NSGCLFU|5|Just enough for the project for the living room. Nice wire that is not cheap and flimsy at all. Does not tear or pull apart without cutting.
B000BH5MAA|5|I used this leveler on my Chalet Arrowhead for 8 years, itwas fantastic. Yes it may be a little heavy, but it is less frustrating than backing back and forth. Only 1 person is needed. I have raised the trailer almost to the top of the screw. It is still stable. Gave trailer and lift to my son he uses it couple of times a month. MY new trailer is tandem axle and i wonder if it works on it or do i need two.
B00KTJLAZ6|5|After I fixed one side, I decided to do the other also.  My post from the driver side ball joint: It's hard to find genuine parts.  Which site should I trust?  Which store could I trust?  Well, I trust Amazon for many years so it was easy to make that purchase knowing I would not get screwed over.  It was slightly more expensive on Amazon but only by dollars.  The part came in 2 days as expected.  It fit my 1996 Toyota 4Runner perfectly.  I have only been driving on it for a couple of days but my truck drives like a dream again.  I trust Amazon.  I trust Toyota.  Perfect match.
B006XCJKJG|3|Ok for home use on lower torque lug nuts. I work in a tire shop and and the torque is sometimes not enough to remove lugs. Also impact sockets fall off the drive. If buying for professional use look for something with more power. Price is good though.
B00IUR88AO|5|An essential piece of equipment for rugged mowing and other outdoor work that kicks up dirt, pollen and other nasty irritants. Comfortable. I wasn't sure I could tolerate this on my face for long periods, but even in hot weather, I don't mind it at all.
B001EOV4NS|5|It is all the quality I expected of Curt.
B003ELXNNI|4|Ordered this for a 14 yo Honda Foreman.  Fit very well and looks nice.  The only thing I would change would be to give it a little more excess around the diameter of skin to gldive a little more surface to staple to.  There is enough, but barely.  It would have made it easier to stretch and hold in place while stapling it to the seat frame.  It looks to be made of a high quality vinyl and I would buy again, but I'd contact the seller to see if they'd give me an extra 1/2&#34; around the sides and back!
B00D38VTTC|5|Love them!!!!!
B001TI5IIQ|3|I had some medium-bad yellowing and oxidation. This kit was not aggressive enough to remove it. I would recommend buying some 600, 1000, and 1500 grit sandpaper. I used approx. 1 sheet per headlight. I then used stage 3 and 4 of the sanding pads followed by the polishing compound. The results were great but the first stage of this kit is not nearly aggressive enough. This kit has enough lubricant and polish for two lenses.
B010XGE3IU|5|The LED bulbs are very bright, even though there's only 4 SMD cells, equal or brighter than other bulbs I bought containing 6 or 8 SMD cells. I wish there's warm white option which would make my car looked warmer than cool white. Other than color option, it considers a good buy for cost per unit.
B00COYNZJ8|4|Just as advertised for the price, i have a hyundai tucson 2015 black with black interiors and it doesnt cover one corner of the windshield, so it doesn't run x large, its standard size but i love it, i get compliments all the time, does the deed of protecting from sun and direct rays i live on a tropical island and works a charm but had burn my fingers taking it off, would buy more great for fan gifts.
B0000AXTUY|5|I have owned the Schumacher SE-12S-CA for 3 1/2 years.  It has never failed me.  The reason why I bought this device in the first place, is value.  The name brand 'Battery Tender' has a device that has smaller amperage in a bigger container.  The BT comes with battery clips and a special plug so that the charger can be removed from the vehicle once attached.  But that charger is twice the price of the Schumacher.  That charger has two styles of connections and lower amps and is not what I want.  I want a device that I can attach to my truck/battery and leave it in the engine compartment.  Mind you, I live in CA and the weather is milder.  But I park the vehicle in snow areas at a vacation home as well as park it in front of my home where it gets above 100F.  It does not bother the device at all.<br />I mounted this unit in the engine compartment and connected it to the battery.  I used a little battery grease on that connection to extend the life of the wiring.  I bought a 12' heavy-duty extension cord and zip tied it to the frame of the truck.  I plugged this unit into the extension cord and made that connection weather proof.  I have the male end of the cord hidden behind the rear bumper.  When I park the truck, I back into position and plug it in.  I use a fuel additive to extend the life of the fuel.  And then I cover the vehicle from the weather.  Last year I drove my 1995 Chevy about a thousand miles.  I obviously use the truck sparingly.  But I just can't seem to part with it for the utility that I need four or five times a year.<br />This charger automatically charges at 1.5 amps which is more than enough to keep the battery healthy.  I highly recommend this unit.

B00D8WHI8O|1|Product came but no where on the package or device did it tell me what the PSI were calibrated at.
B006AFAWYI|3|This mop works great. It is however pretty heavy and requires some strength to use.
B000E4VG00|5|Good
B000BYB8F6|3|This plug seems like a good one, installed on a 1983 Honda 200X. My only complaint is that when I opened the package, the plug was out of the box, and the box open, the plug without the cardboard protector on it. I hope there was no damage to the porcelain or terminal. We'll see.
B0022ZEKCU|5|Recommended by a friend, very good product. I will continue to use.
B008LUT6XS|4|Worked only ok for a 900 sq ft condo.  I out in four of these....meh
B001AIZ5HY|4|Worked as advertised. Takes some &#34;elbow grease,&#34; but if you follow the instructions, you'll end up with a great result. Beats buying new headlight assemblies!
B00MAWUNCG|5|Just what I needed.
B00KPWBBLA|5|Very happy with the looks and for the most part the install. Had to unbit one of the slots a bit to get it to mount up. Other than that,PERFECT. I have a 2014 jeep wrangler Rubicon unlimited.
B003175JBY|3|The mount looks great, but the additional lighting proved to be somewhat limited.. Maybe I have to put in a more powerful battery... Not too pleased with this purchase.
B000KPYBBO|5|Delivered on time. Easy to install. Works with out stickie tape.<br />It's all good
B00335FFWM|5|I Like
B001XUD46S|5|Fit is good - just as expected.
B00VSHYK6Y|1|Very poor quality. You are supposed to be able to plug in the OEM turn signals, but the hole for the bulb to go through is too small, due to poor plastic casting.  A little filing around the edges is required, however, this gets plastic dust into the lens area, which is really noticeable as it is silver plastic on a black background.  There are no paper instructions, so you'll need to look on YouTube for some install tutorial.  It's not hard, but there is wiring involved.  You'll need to be able to splice wires, add connectors and use a volt meter.  Probably the worst part of these lights are that the light they produce is less than half of what the OEM headlights did.  Ultimately, I would say these lights are a complete rip off and would not recommend them.
B0002L6NAI|5|Seems to be very high quality, I haven't used any cheaper alternatives in the past, so I cannot make comparisons to other products. The price is high, but I am happy that it is made in the USA. When I initially installed it in my 2007 Accord Sedan, the shade fit snugly from top to bottom, but left a gap on both ends side-to-side. I am hoping that it will cover the gaps once the sun relaxes the wrinkles out of the material. I did not need to use my visors to support the shade, since it was a press-fit against the edge of the headliner.
B006FG0A1M|5|Perfect
B000R4CLO2|5|Very useful adaptor for plugging in a cooler when driving long distances.
B00G0M6YV6|5|Perfect

B00QLZXOQ0|5|I put these on my truck I wanted to try them out before I give my review they work well I have went down some rough roads with them to see if they would mess up honestly I would buy them again good  light for a good price
B00BI3WLHS|5|Sticks well and looks just like picture
B0089Z0ABM|5|Great color looks awesome
B004EGAYNY|3|One was wired backwards causing fuse to blow after fixing the wiring they worked great
B000IZ3OH8|4|Returned to this OEM filter for my 2010 Malibu after hearing complaints about collapsing filters from another brand.  Never had an issue with AC Delco.
B00CM4QY3O|5|Nice lite
B00414SZTE|5|I like my sign.  These people are fast at getting the item to you!  I plan on getting the Published Author on my next order!
B000AP8DZY|5|We use Collinite on our wood furniture and kitchen, bathroom and basement cupboard doors.  No streaks, great shine, easy to put on and wipe off.  Love it!
B000IYC93O|5|They work.
B00OLVGGZM|5|This Dee Zee DZ87005 Heavyweight Utility Mat fits perfectly for my 2015 Ford F-150 XLT SuperCrew 5'5&#34; bed! Shipping was fast. All I had to do was unroll the utility mat, turn it the proper direction in the bed, and lay it down. That's it! The mat is heavy enough that there are no folds or creases like you see with rolled items (i.e., carpet). I'm glad I bought this mat. See pictures. I am buying another mat for a 2014 Ford F-150 6'5&#34; bed.
B00KN0UOEE|5|I've used this stuff for over 12 years. Keeps all the plastic and vinyl parts protected and keeps their colors the same as when the car was new. A big plus - unlike most every car I've seen, it has kept the lens covers on my headlights crystal clear with no fading, clouding or yellowing.<br /><br />The bottle says apply every 5-6 weeks. Twelve years ago I did that but after the first year I simply applied it 2-3 times each year and it still protected just fine.
B0038YPF28|5|Love it... Was here before ETD
B003YJ8TVQ|5|Was able to plug in GPS, Heated Travel Coffee Mug and 2 phones with no issues.  Great device, I may purchase one for my other vehicle
B00MVMMIA0|5|They work great on 12VAC.  I just replaced my 11W incandescent T5 wedge bulbs with these in my outdoor path lights.  Nice bright white light.  They're a little brighter and a little whiter than the incandescents, but they look great.  I didn't notice any 60 Hz flickering.  I was prepared to stick a full-wave bridge rectifier in the circuit to convert to DC 120 Hz, but it wasn't necessary.
B00Q2HTHTK|5|Great buy i really like the program setup it has
B003U53JYG|5|I purchased this product to try out due to on going CA drought, water rationing and I do not like driving my cars with a dirty exterior.  This product is great to clean a lightly dirty car i.e. light layers of dirt and dust, no caked on mud/dirt/dried bird droppings  Just follow the products directions - spray on, wipe, and finish off with a clean cloth and the car comes out looking like it just got washed the traditional way!  Faster than using the traditional water method - rinse dirt off/soap down/rinse off/wipe dry.  At times, I did have some dried bird droppings and road grease behind the wheel well areas, but I just sprayed a second time and used a little muscle to remove these items to get it cleaned off. My car colors are white, black and blue, 2 compacts, 1 SUV, 1 convertible, and 1 mid size.  I have washed these vehicles twice now and still have about 10-15% left of the original gallon I purchased. The black vehicle's exterior looked great after this treatment.  I did not have any streaks. I used the microfiber cloths that Costco sells in bulk, especially good for the final wipe down.  I even used this stuff on the alloy wheels of my vehicles.  Took off  the road grease, brake dust, etc  without much effort.  I enjoy using this product and purchased a 2nd gallon to keep my cars looking great.  Just checked the price for this product.  Approximately  $15 more now!
B000H3S4M6|2|not interested
B00ULNXEUO|5|Top quality
B00GSAUHB8|5|I love my sunshade ! It works as described . I use it every day. It was delivered on time and packaged just right. I am very satisfied.
B008CE0O8E|5|Works great on my table lift and my trailer!!!!! I will definitely buy more!!!
B0036QZ8VQ|5|I've been using these for about 2 years now to wash my bike on and store it during winter. Great buy, it holds my cbr 600 with ease
B00UCITKUQ|5|Works well...easy to fold up snd store.
B00BYVVTLS|3|Had good luck with these previously for a different vehicle so decided to buy this brand again for my Subaru. The sheetmetal clips didn't fit the calipers properly and scraped on the rotors. After some adjustments they weren't screeching anymore but the pads still squeal at low speed. Not 100 % satisfied. Applied disc brake silencer too but that didn't help. Other than that they work fine.
B0002SRCMO|5|Good
B00GHT4IDI|5|prefect fit, great price. Someone tried to pull the old one out without the proper puller and they broke the lip. Instead of taking a chance I just replaced it.
B000WK4EC8|5|Have used S100 for years. Would recommend and have recommended to many. Will continue to use.
B00M9IAJQQ|4|This cover definitely keeps the child safety seats cool.  The first time I used it, I expected the seat to still feel warm, but not hot to touch.  The seat was actually cool, and not &#34;just not warm.&#34;  Given I had been running the air conditioning in the car to cool the car off, but the sunshade cover had been on the seat all day and up until I put my child in.<br /><br />This fits my Recaro Performance Ride car seat well, even with the cup holder sticking out.  It rolls up easily and fits in the side door pocket.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this product five stars is because it does take two hands to use it.  If the design could be changed so that it only takes one hand to put on, then I would absolutely love it!
B0002SR2RY|5|bought this for use on ACDelco 19244500 oil sending unit and it fit nicely, had used a standard socket on another one and it was too tight a fit and if you are in a tight position it will break sender.
B00S05HR8U|5|Beautiful, easy to install. Even though Amazon said it wouldn't fit my 2003 Trailblazer, it fit perfectly.
B003V5RX4M|5|Good
B00AC5WX8U|4|Very cute and my daughter loved them -- but a bit bulky.
B0051MYLS4|5|great brush-love it
B00E1SKGHE|5|I wasn't sure what to expect from the &#34;Tommy Boyy&#34; company, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the parts and the fast shipping.  I've had them on my Passat for about a month now and am extremely satisfied with them.  I will definitely consider Callahan brake packages for my other vehicles.
B0030GJ2VY|5|Very nice towel, love the sewn edges
B00THP4BYK|5|Very happy with this purchase! Plastics came wrapped in plastic to protect them from scratches and was shipped very fast! Awesome deal!
B000NW6VVW|5|Perfect. Fast shipping too!
B002RZC8WE|2|Seal leaked on the top first time I used it.  Thought it would be a good deal, but should have bought something better.
B002IKWG4I|5|Great gloves, I've been using them for 2 years with my scooter and still complete. Not all-weather, avoid rain.
B006H3HN1I|5|Fits perfectly, thank's to the seller.
B00QPZ0JCI|2|No info on the length or size of the metric bolts to install it. The area for the handle bars is to large means they had to be skimmed. The ad says for my bike but it is not. This Is the 4th or 5th bike I had risers on but did not have all these problems. Won't use this company again.
B007MAYZ98|5|Nice fit truck looks great
B00HLAHQO0|5|Perfect, fixed my problem with the air.

B007KLX50Y|1|Says it's a set, but I only received one headlight.
B00A7Z509Y|5|works great on my 98 Ford F150 using my droid phone
B00KLZ65GM|1|I've purchased these before and you can't beat them for the price.<br />Yes... they are thin and the printing is fairly cheesy.  What do you expect for less than a buck with free shipping?<br /><br />However, they do the job of a basic buff... they cover your hair and block the sun to some extent.  Great when doing projects around the house such as painting, etc.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I re-ordered 10 of them and it never arrived on the slow boat from China.  So far my emails to the seller have gone unanswered.  If they resolve this, they will get 5 stars.
B001GJ3DZS|5|Great brush for the rims, use it with a wheel cleaner (like 3M's) for best results.

B007486N4S|4|Fit ok!!!
B004MDEV38|3|Nice looking but arrived with lots of chips in the paint. Waiting for replacement because a couple were nut size and would rust quickly in winter. The similar hitch we had received the week before looked great and installed painlessly.
B007OXCJFA|5|Great Material.  I wrapped parts of my car.
B004L04TD4|4|They Worth it
B00MB0E1WK|5|Love it. Mines came in a week (5 days). Easy installation.

B00C070M9K|5|Easy to install and is a great value. Works great with IR headphones.
B000COBHKG|1|This y pipe is not meant for the 68470 headers. It is the wrong pipe according to someone at hedman. Do not buy to use with the 68470 headers.
B0048F7ODE|4|No cutout for the dash glove box
B000ELRB4S|5|Works great. Took some shall we say, mechanical language, and force to squeeze it into my ford probe. But I got it.

B00L89GVAA|5|Was real great verry happy with them
B00S87VPQ0|4|Looks good, still waiting on the rest of my order to be shipped
B003K3J9HO|5|A friend told about these Rotors, and they didn't disappoint. I'd buy them again.
B00P9RYBK4|5|Use it fill the trailer and works like a charm. I bought a long hose for my 400 gallon tank and it did exactly what I expected to, only faster and without any hiccups.
B008BTLB1O|5|Perfect
B000COCU84|2|I don't do reviews often because I don't like to be petty and after all I research all product thoroughly before buying.  But I am going to be petty just this once.<br /> The lights are brighter than stocks yes but they still throw a yellow beam.  The package does say whiter and brighter so I expected that.<br />I was looking for a modern white not bluesy color to match my headlights on a Mercedes c300.<br />Is you are looking for the same don't bother but if you want to keep the a yellow light that's nice and bright this is for you.
B000VJPRYO|5|These are nice filters!  I got two but my original is still good.  I now have about ten years worth of filters!  Haha!
B00MB0E1WK|5|I love the vibrant color.
B00VMXE7V2|5|These are so super cute! We are getting married this year, and they are a great keepsake. Love them!

B00V70XTC8|5|Fits my car perfect!!!! Delivered on time....
B007ZDDUCK|5|Used on a purse, and it truly seems like a rich lotion for leather.  Squeeze top dispenser makes it easy to dispense.
B00SNT9ANI|5|Awesome decal looks amazing can't go wrong
B00M5BXLNA|4|Works great other than the tie rod ends are a little short for a TX Gator. I reused the old ones and all is good.
B00SXWEI00|5|Got this license plate for my black truck. I keep getting compliments on it all the time. Great quality and so far it hasn't faded one bit. I did add a license plate frame to mine. Highly recommend this company and plate to anyone. My font I used was Script Thick......LOVE IT!!
B003881BUE|5|All it really took to make my 1971 Corvette sit level as it was from the factory.  Great investment and less than two hours to install.
B00WTUJDI4|5|The decal is very nice. Very well colored and saturated. Its thicker than most decals I deal with and thats a plus. It gives me more wiggle room to move the air bubbles without bending the decal too much. Highly recommended if this is the style you are looking for. Worth the few extra bucks.
B00BTLEHSK|5|These seat covers were great!! Fits great& easy to install. My husband is now going to order his😀

B002R0MMFC|5|it was perferct fit for protege 2000, may the only thing that I would think of is that you have to use the old nuts, other than that everything worked perfectly fine!
B00CUNALVI|5|Love it! It is a product that meets its expectations and that's all I want!
B007ZGDNR4|5|Loved it and is best bang for your buck..butt dyno agrees too.

B001AZH6H4|2|Neat idea for the price, but the little end caps keep falling off. Didn't even last one use.
B00OLP5KXM|5|Love this product.
B00CZL1GNC|5|We bought this for a new rider who is also a pit bull owner. He loves his guardian bell!
B0036QX4EY|4|Used it on a Ninja 300 and a Ninja 1000.  it is OK, plastic wheels like all other stands, but I didn't like how the rubber tips on the swing arm  hook fell off from one use, I didn't know/expect that they will come off that easily-and lost them.  they are suppose to protect the swing-arm form scratches especially on the 2014 Ninja 1000 with the mini spools.  it held the 510 lbs. bike steady. also it does not interfere with the back end on the Ninja 1000.  P.S.  much better quality than Pit Posse.
B00JBI9VHA|4|Fit and work well! Wife loves them in her Charger.
B0064BAGQW|5|Fit right, felt snug, clear and tinted visor a plus, not sure about the brand but a really good helmet

B005U80R0K|1|Does it come with a gasket?
B001P4GTPK|5|Its what the SRT Viper oil filter is made for. I use nothing else.
B008BFEOJY|3|Don't always stay connected
B00KTJLSQW|5|It's hard to find genuine parts.  Which site should I trust?  Which store could I trust?  Well, I have trusted Amazon for many years so it was easy to make that purchase knowing I would not get screwed over.  It was slightly more expensive on Amazon but only by dollars.  The part came in 2 days as expected.  It fit my 1996 Toyota 4Runner perfectly.  I have only been driving on it for a couple of days but my truck drives like a dream again.  I trust Amazon.  I trust Toyota.  Perfect match.
B006FDD74W|1|Neber was able to make this work.  No one would cut it into a key for me.
B000CMCNJC|5|PERFEC WAS THE SAMEONE I NEED.GREAT PRICE. THANK YOU
B004ARPIFQ|4|This tool works as advertised but only after a slight modification!<br /><br />We were working on a Agco-Allis GT55 tractor and needed to pressure test our new hoses for leaks.  Obviously, I was eager to try this new tool out.  After looking at the adapters, it was quite clear which adapter to choose to seal the radiator with.  Next, I grab the medium sized adapter and try to fit it into the opening.  To my amazement it wouldn't fit, the threaded-brass part was slightly to big!<br /><br />Now I'm getting mad, so I remove the rubber from the threaded part and try only the rubber to see if it fits into the radiator opening.  Sure enough it easily slides right in.  Being a machinist, I immediately chuck the threaded-brass part into my lathe and turn it down just enough to where it will fit into the radiator opening.<br /><br />After reassembling the rubber and threaded-brass part back together, it easily slides into the radiator and I begin screwing the two together to create the seal.  Next, I attached the pump and applied 15psig to the system and found a small leak due to a hose clamp not being tight enough.  After sorting that problem, we re-pressurized the system and it held at 15psig for 10+ minutes.<br /><br />Satisfied that the system was now leak free, we finished reassembling the tractor and put it back to work with no overheating or coolant leaking issues!<br /><br />Problem solved and onto the next repair!<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with the tool, price, and performance but unless you own a lathe or your creative with a mill,, I think its a little far fetched to call this tool &#34;Universal&#34; right out of the box hence the reason I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars.  If you have to machine something to make it work for you then the tool needs to be revised slightly.
B00K56PO7S|5|I love my window shade! It's cute, feminine, and it looks adorable in my car!

B00GOZVRV6|5|I'm a Grandma of 5 and with the help of YouTube I was able to install this myself and save $400 over what the dealer wanted to install one!
B001EAQTRI|4|Took out the majority of the ground loop noise I was experiencing with my new bluetooth receiver. Still a very slight wine in the background but I think I am the only one that hears it. Thanks!
B00480J4KA|5|Exactly what I needed for my 2002 Infiniti QX4! Matched the other bulb perfectly and is the same color as other headlight bulb when lit.
B005JZD6KM|5|My second purchase !
B000F17CAU|4|DashMat has been around for decades and these new ones are okay but the quality but can't compare to the ones I bought years ago. I guess you can say that about a lot of things as in &#34;they don't make 'em like they used to.&#34;<br /><br />The fit was okay on my 1998 CR-V but the length was a little lacking as the top was too short to tuck in between the dash and windshield to open up the vent cut-outs more.<br /><br />All in all as stated in the title, a decent product at a decent price. My only real complaint is it took over three weeks from ordering to receiving.
B00T5QFI0M|3|Worked fine I just personally found it annoying and uncomfortable
B000X23TQC|3|I have used their products before, this one is a miss. Material is great as usual. The fit is very poor. It does not fit the Audi Q5 well. I returned it. Very disappointed. Bought the original Audi product.  It is a perfect fit even though the material is probably not as good as WeatherTech.
B00VY3GF2Y|4|Hreat product.  Looks better for the price. Seller very helpful & nice, Will buy again!
B00522O87W|1|Very unhappy with this item. Within a day the graphic had already come unglued from the magnet. It looks like the graphic was printed on the back of an ad for pet food and hand cut. I guess you get what you pay for.
B000VU7C1Y|4|I can see... i put it in a 98 suzuki samurai, mine comes with an annoying parabolic reflector, i put it off because the existing left headlamp does not have it.<br />very bad the information from amazon, the pattern its not the same as show in the picture, mine comes with the pattern as showed in this document.<br />hella have a lot of product codes, so its very difficult to find the correct product.<br />http://www.hella.com/toc/es/4C83A0C7F087018FD1468C633B4F815B71.srv?dlg=CtxCtrDocumentServer&action=GetArticleDocument&DocType=PDF&docId=3504
B000COTKDM|1|It's a wench, but very hard to use, not worth the effort.
B00PHMGT6K|5|THIS is an updated and improved version of a truly simple and great tool! I am a mobile jobber and my customers that come to my truck immediately grab the tool as they know how quickly and easily it handles front end and suspension work.This simple tool works way, way better than the old pry bar or bracket arrangement.<br />It makes most of the jobs a one man arrangement, great for small shops with limited manpower. Using your weight as leverage it frees both hands to do your work. Thanks for a great product!
B000C9M30E|5|Easy to install. no issues yet. Driver side is harder than passenger.
B00AQ29EDQ|1|Love the look of product however,The tabs broke on 2 out of 4 hub caps, this is the 2nd time, returned first order..fixing to return again..
B00ZQ32VVC|3|Unfortunately these do not fit my face, they are to large for me. They are well made, but they do not flex in the center so do not seal on my face.
B00EKN8FXC|5|These LED bulb work very well in our camp trailer. There is no compromise to lighting to convert to these.
B004GCTFRW|5|Exactly as advertised. Works great!
B00D7H6NY0|5|Perfect product :-)
B0041LN1L4|5|Product is good, customer service is excellent.
B00GRV800S|1|I had high hopes for this tool to let me bleed the brakes on my cars when they need it. I bought the V-5 because I don't need to do this very often, but I'd like to get rid of the requirement for a helper.  All I can say is that the tool is cheaply made: all plastic, and not particularly robust plastic at that. The plunger would stick on mine, and leave me wondering whether I'd break the handle. The plunger is reminiscent of a dosing syringe like you get at the pharmacy for giving liquids to children. There's not even a basic plastic case (like a pencil box or something) to store a tool that will inevitably get messy.  Worst of all though is that this gizmo ended up putting more air in my brake lines than I had when I started. I suspect it is from either a leaky plunger seal or too much agitation of the fluid (as another reviewer has noted). It was bad enough that I had to pay for a professional pressure bleeding to get it all out.  Either buy the higher-end models, or use the old methods. It's not worth your time to try this.
B003TQ4JNG|5|nice machine work. Fit like a glove! my C-4 is up and strong again!
B00P2RYKYS|5|Direct fit on my 08 Sienna. Works great.
B00TQZU0FA|5|High quality. Appears as if it will last a long time.
B004O1YTLW|3|Didn't seem to slow down the lcd signal lights like I expected but it works.
B000KXA6HY|5|Worked great.
B003RAQAR2|4|Shipped Fast. Looks Fantastic. Head turner
B004RI67AS|4|Nice
B00806DYUO|1|Broke after only a few months. It was my passenger side as well. I operated it maye 25 times and it broke just like the crappy OEM version, but in a FRACTION of the time. I'm now stuck with another useless sin visor dangling in my car. Extremely frustrating.
B00LDNL7TQ|5|At the price paid for I was a bit weary but I was willing to try them cause I was in that cheap mood. They have been installed for about 3 weeks or more now and they light up the road, I have them in a projector housing and they shine bright.  very happy, if your looking for a good bulb and you aren't trying to take out a small loan to do it these are a good buy. How long will they last TBD
B00C43BNIO|5|this is a great product for your marine engine,it burns clean but lubricate.
B00R46X0KA|5|I own a 2009 Nissan Versa.  Kmashi worked perfectly for my little car.  When the original battery in my car finally needed to be replaced two months ago, I started my car with the Kmashi and drove to the auto parts store for a new battery.  They didn't have one in stock and told me to drive to another location in town.  When the gentleman told me to wait while he went to get something to boost my battery, I said no need, I have something right here.  He was very impressed with my Kmashi.  Easy to use and works perfectly; I would highly recommend the Kmashi.
B0083G3AXC|4|Great accessory for my zero-gravity chair. attaches easily.
B001RLZ7UY|5|Work great
B00445L290|1|hose fell apart after 10 uses
B0035AMPFK|5|What I ordered... received as promised. .. appears to be of good quality.
B00OYAKZF2|5|better than ebay
B00I0H26WU|4|looks good and is working fine for now
B00EDQ6L5A|5|Awesome
B004I0PP4Y|5|needed one got it and it is in use
B000CPAWNI|5|Used it in our log splitter, and it worked just fine
B00COYZU1Y|4|Installation was simple took less than an hour in my driveway with basic hand tools the only negative is that I wish the mounting brackets had a little more support with the step bars installed and everything tight the bars have some flex to them I feel that when you step on them they should not move other than that I am happy with the product.
B00EPDLUVQ|5|Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted!!!  Thank you
B00HJDY6PG|5|Fits perfectly.
B0057HECZU|4|Worked perfect, took me a while to get the little metal peices in for the screws but works great
B0000AZ6WB|5|I used this to fix the winch setup on our boat trailer.  It works very well.
B000GU7E0I|1|Switch is no good.
B00BTS9EYU|5|I've always loved dragons. They're everywhere in my room, so this fit me perfectly one I bought my new car
B00M2V4JOI|4|I have used this  testing unit only two times. It worked correctly in setup, auto identification, problem code, and engine light clearance. Appears to be a useful device and I hope it lasts as long as I own vehicles.
B000N5JRBK|4|My s2000 sounds sexy now
B001D3MF60|4|Works great. Little bigger than I expected though.
B003JBPJPS|5|Great Buy, especially love the anti-slippery material underneath the cover so it doesn't slide around.
B00W6YSGFO|4|Fit is tight, and I even measured my hand and ordered based on the posted dimensions for each size.
B004A34G94|5|Perfect replacement and easy installation
B00NJ43SSU|3|Seems to be fairly sturdy and does help getting in and out but doesn't fit very tight. Handle moves around while trying to get in.
B00029XDTO|4|works a treat, fitted to my Jeep wrangler TJ. sure it over reads a bit but I am happy
B000CSD29Q|5|Continued preventative maintenance.  Changed antifreeze and this keeps it clean.
B00KGETCHW|4|Fast shipping, pretty good quality, could be a little heavier, but sure that would be more $
B005GL86Z4|4|A little looser then I would have thought but the price was right and it will do the job.
B000CMIYWW|3|So so. I'll buy a better quality product next time.
B001JT77BG|5|Good For a CB Radio
B00P0DONAU|5|The fit was very tight although I bought it according to the fitment chart, but for the price I guess it was okay. I'm using it to cover the spare tire on my equipment trailer, so as long as it does not fall off when I'm driving I'm happy with it.
B000CQOIR8|3|unnecessarily complicated but i modified and used it anyway.
B000NCOKZQ|5|I did not know that that this item came with the battery charger. Now I have a spare.
B00TGDQ69Q|2|Why no user reviews? Not very encouraging to invest in this.
B00AU6KVZ8|5|Very good, would use again.
B0023VF07M|3|I purchased a set and both the lights went out in less than a month.  So my $100 set turned into a $130 set :/ but they arrived on time and now work.
B00OR2HRZI|5|Half the price and speared to be the same or better quality than the stock one I took off.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Useful, large enough for a family of 4 with some extra space for someone to lie down and easy enough to fold make it compact. A very nice picnic/beach/camp addition that won't take much space
B00S4HFNXK|4|These are nice protectors for a light weight craft or in addition to bumpers on a mid size.  The flatness allows for better coverage while tied up, in your slip to keep from rubbing against the piling or bulk head.  the take up little room in the boat so they are easy to stow...make sure you do stow them as because they are light they will blow out of the boat while running.
B003UPVRMM|3|Works fine
B00C30727O|2|They fit great but didn't stay in place worth a darn!
B00GHS10WQ|5|Mounted up perfectly to my 2004 H2.
B001FAK28E|4|Overall pretty easy to install, my inital review for this was bad because the viewing angles where terrible but i messed with the mirrors a bit and turns out all i had to do was unscrew them and adjust them a little, they are really nice and not to hard to install, the tough part is gettting the mirror of the stock bracket, i found the easy way to do it, is to take a screw driver and drop it in the screw hold in the bottom of the bracket, then hit the handle of the screw dirver with a hammer holding the mirror by the stock bracket over my couch, the mirror poped out and landed safely on my couch, then i took them out to the jeep and installed them.
B008UXT712|5|Another item I thought would be expensive and hard to find. I love being wrong on those two categories. The product fits perfect and works great. Fast shipping, which is another plus in my book.
B00CL0ZRX2|5|Love love love the lights! Bought three for my jeep & they are great! Will be buying more soon!
B009AA2J0U|5|Easy installation on my '08 Silverado. Disconnect battery. Remove 4 bolts and set aside plastic brush guard. Unplug old sensor, remove single bolt. Install new sensor, plug in. Install brush guard. Reconnect battery. Computer clears airbag fault on startup. The old part had the exact problem others have described: a crack in plastic housing where the bolt goes through, apparently letting moisture in and messing up the tiny circuit board inside. These are the only 2 airbag sensors on this model truck, and usually this is the problem. Buying 2 of these was only a little more expensive than simply having the airbag code read at your dealer.
B00FMUYYT6|5|Works well, easy to install. Heavy metal.
B007J0V7MO|1|Definitely NOT a replacement for automotive turn signal or brake lights!<br /><br />These do &#34;replace&#34; ordinary incandescent automotive bulbs.  But as previous reviewers discovered, the light output is a fraction of that of the stock incandescent bulb.  I attempted to use these in my wife's Mini Cooper but during the daylight you could not tell they were on!  At night you could see that they were working, but they looked pink and were very, very dim.  It would be unsafe (and undoubtedly illegal) to use.<br /><br />I have contacted the supplier and after their repeated suggestions that there was something wrong with the wiring in my car, they have agreed to refund the purchase price.
B005947ZR8|5|Just what was needed worked great and was correct the first order and received much quicker than from camping supply store.
B00E3YIYQ6|5|Awesome job from this company. I just emailed them my cars VIN and about a week later the bumper was wrapped very well sitting on my front porch. Just be very careful and make sure that it is for the correct make and model of your car! I accidently ordered for the wrong body style and they gladly took it back and sent me the correct bumper. Not their fault all mine and they were very nice to fix it.
B0055TLHUI|5|solved fuel supply problem on Yamaha Cart
B000AMOEIC|1|This siphon - to put it bluntly - is a worthless peace of crap. I picked one up locally for a few dollars at an Auto Parts store and even at only several bucks, it's a total rip-off. The people at Victor should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for turning out such a worthless product. It is so cheaply made and so thin that I think if it were any less, it wouldn't even exist. The plastic is comically thin and the siphon tube which is included is horribly in effective when stuck into a tank, because its ultra thin walls give no rigidity as far as remaining straight. It's just a floppy curved mess and completely useless in most situations where it's needed. For an extra 25 cents, this product could have been made a little better and might actually find a home in someone's tool box, instead of the trash can.
B0049MEE0C|5|Good product
B010H0QV00|4|I usually use a pencil style tire pressure gauge. They're compact, lightweight, and most importantly requires no batteries. So you can throw it in your glove or tool box and forget about it.<br />This tire gauge on the other hand is digital. Requires batteries--which isn't really a problem until you have to replace them or they go dead on you.<br />The 9-in-1 unit uses five LR44 type batteries. While looking around I see that the 5-in-1 unit uses two AAA batteries. Which is a little disappointing since LR44 batteries are cheap (or easy) to replace if you're at a gas station. I would really like to see a single or double AAAs. But I guess to accommodate the number of tools it has, it had to use button cells.<br />The tools are somewhat useful. If you're in pitch black darkness, the front torch light is what it is--useful only is pitch darkness. Not very bright. The red LED is sort of useful? Again, not very bright bright. The Swiss army like tools are, okay. The saw is useless if it isn't locking, and the scissors are good for single (maybe double) paper cutting. Both units come with a glass breaker. I would definitely trade the useless tools for the 5-in-1 unit that runs on AAA batteries.<br /><br />That being said, the tire pressure gauge works wonders. It's all digital, the back-lit read out is clean and easy to read. Accuracy is on point compared to my pencil style pressure gauge. Again, if you can live without all those features, I'd go with the 5-in-1 unit since it runs on easy to get AAA batteries.
B0031ZDU62|5|Only needed to use 2 but couldn't pass up the deal. Fixed my misfire issue. Excursion is running great now.
B009TB9UPW|1|CAR DEALER STATED IF I INSTALL THIS I WILL LOOSE MY WARRANTY
B003C20USK|4|Fit ok!!!
B003FNS7O0|5|General quality
B004NBME5Q|4|Works well
B001UMZ07A|3|This product is rather messy (getting black on everything it touches), but despite it being so stain oriented, the primer colored chipping under my wife's black Lexus didn't hold the black color worth a darn, so it would wipe back off.  It did offer a small amount of blackening which we could see, but the difference surely wasn't what we expected.
B002BG4WX2|5|Worked for me on a Chevrolet truck by curing a seepage I could not locate even with UV dye and a (money well spent) Fluke blacklight. I bought a can after hearing about it on HVAC forums.<br /><br />Remember that stop leak products do not fix worn MOVING parts in compressors etc, Sometimes they work on non-moving leaks, sometimes not. They are not a theoretically ideal repair but if they work you can save time and money.<br /><br />I waited a couple of months to post this review to be sure it succeeded.
B002UCYS0Y|1|Right now at over $8 these are too expensive.  This price is just plain broken.  Everybody else charges around $3 for these.
B00M0YRYQM|5|I love the design and how it matches with the 180deg pants, very light weight and air can flow through. I'll make an update after a few uses and washes to see if it stands the test
B003AZH78U|5|Use in my 2014 Harley Davidson Ultra Limited. The transmission is noticeably smoother, easy to shift. Highly Recommend!
B00LNDK5DA|3|It was too large and then when I did return it I got charged for returning the item, not a happy camper. I guess the item is okay provided that it fits but for me it was too large.
B00CDW2MCM|4|Fast and quiet.  Just be sure you don't accidentally plug it into a 10amp port instead of a 15amp port.  My Subaru has one of each, and it blew the 10amp fuse pretty quickly.  My own fault, really since the manual specifies a 15amp port, and I didn't bother to check mine until AFTER the fuse blew.  Running on the 15amp port, it's the fastest quietest 12v compressor I've used, and I've had two others.  If it lasts at least as long as the last one of a different brand (5 years or so, using about once a month), it'll be worth the reasonable price of around $40 I paid for it.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love it!
B001KSEFGQ|5|Fit right into place with no vacuum leaks
B000COSAEC|5|great
B00NMQOD1G|5|Very sharp looking. Each white part is it's own piece. Very easy to apply. Beware of Lannisters once applied. Winter is Coming.
B00S8KQCVU|2|It did not fit my vehicle like amazon said it would
B00NODHD6O|5|I tryd them on my 1993 Chevy Silverado and they fit perfect.
B00KTJ1VNM|3|Key feels cheaply made, not durable like the oem key fob keys. Also, the plastic rubs up against the rubber around the key hole on my 08 f150 cause it to be snug when trying to turn the key. A little more rigidity would have been nice.
B00C7YTTGI|1|Will not work on tanks that have any old liner still inside. Does not tell you that on the box or the instructions.<br />Only in tiny print on can. Coverage looks ok down the filler. I however can open a large panel and look inside. Coverage is a joke. Northern suggested I thin with acetone. After the fact. The instructions on the box don't mach the instruction sheet inside. And that docent match the printing on the can. Waste of money and time.
B001NZ0SP8|5|save a tone of money
B004RT2LM0|5|These are the perfect muffler for the Mustang. I had a cheaper set, but they droned around 1800 RPM and were annoying on the freeway. These give a deep purr at idle but a roar under hard acceleration. However, there is not much increased sound level while cruising so no raising your voice on the phone or turning up the volume on the radio. Borla's customer service is also second to none. My left muffler hung a bit lower than the right so I sent them an email. They responded in hours and shipped me a new set plus paid the return postage for the original pair! When I emailed the manufacturer of my cheaper mufflers about the drone my inquiry was ignored. You do get what you pay for! The fit of the replacements was perfect and the large tips really fill out the exhaust cutouts. Yes, these are not cheap and there are less expensive options but they sound great, fit right and if there is a problem they will back up their product.
B001GBJQCA|5|Instruction would be better if they were update with better pictures. Overall, the product is simple to install. Took about 20 minutes.
B00D99RJOO|1|Received product today but only received the window shades, no moonroof shade. Description says 3 pcs.
B00KGIE926|5|Starter workers as good as the oem one it replaced and at a fraction of the cost
B00EFC5PE0|1|didnt meet my expectations thought was something else
B000CO8ZJM|5|What else can I say....it works...Yes I recommend
B004UBCKYY|5|These are great. I have used them many times already. GREAT for splinters. And they fit on dogtags perfectly. I never leave home without them.
B00B9HCI44|5|As advertised and arrived on time...
B00RYVKPIK|3|Totally yellow. No orange tint to it. Also not very bright for a yellow light at that. But it is a LED and they all worked
B00WB0217C|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Cadillac Escalade ESV. Works Great, nice packaged. Fast shipping.
B00K5L8CPO|2|Worked great.Nice shine.The sprayer failed on my second time using it,though.
B0050CJ13K|4|It's only two weeks since I applied the first application. It did darken the color. At this point I am very please with its proformance !
B0027G406K|3|Looks nice. Passenger side is an exact fit. Drivers side is off a bit but still fits fairly well
B00IZFNJ6Y|5|Works great.  Saved a big PIA on a motorcycle electrical gimlet search.
B002UCYRZU|5|Works good polished my 180 gallons fish tank nicely
B00RRBP460|5|All is bright...nice 😀  recommended...
B002UJVNFA|5|Very inexpensive.
B00NAC4F6U|5|Nice item!
B00NTU18KY|5|Works well. Allowed me to measure all my chargers and cables. Now I know how to get the fastest charging rates out of my equipment.
B00ECXT26Y|5|Nice nice nice!!!!
B00UKIUJ12|5|nice sticker boxed and protected
B0058PRY2E|5|Quality piece ,simple install, should've bought these a long time ago.
B009OBW23O|5|Covered up all of the scratches inside the door handles and easily takes off oxidation.
B00HRGM5U8|5|Awesome
B00AJZ61G8|5|Great item, simple and exactly what I wanted!
B00KHUQIF4|4|very good
B00412YT8W|5|First of all know this, I don't know crap about replacing a window motor in a car. Second of all know this, it only took about 45 minutes and a lot of that time was me trying to find the right dang socket for the job. But seriously, it was super easy to do the replacement, worst part was the heat and the mosquitoes, the work itself was pretty easy.<br /><br />And please let me say, f-you Nalley Nissan of Decatur (GA). I saw this part, read the reviews and saw the estimated timeframe. I called Nalley Nissan to see the estimated cost to do the same...$300+ for the part and $300+ for the install Over $650 to do what I did for $53.00. I told him no thanks that I can get that part on Amazon for $53, he said &#34;go for it&#34;, so I did.
B00PB80F92|5|They arrived a day early and went into the car nicely. Haven't put many miles on them but they seem to be working great!! Very happy with my purchase.
B003PB9PN4|5|quiet fan pulls a lot of air use 2 of them on a bbc with alum. rad no problems!!!
B000RZPNOQ|5|I had black mildew on boat seats.  This took it right off!  Be careful when you spray it - don't leave on too long it streaks.
B00FJODH5M|5|Looks nice on my 2015 mazda 3, I use the sun shaders to securely pin it to the windshield. It will hold the heat temporarily and won't make the surfaces hot.
B00DZX31QY|4|We bought this to assist in swapping out bent valves in a VW Beatle. The job would have been impossible without such a tool. This one worked very well. The only suggested improvement might be some rubber tips to keep the unit from sliding on the valve face.
B00RV46YBC|5|Very Satisfied love the brightness
B00W6T1NHW|5|Amazon shipped super fast, Installed and working perfectly!!! Saved much $$$!
B00LIWMEJO|5|Thank
B0014H7LUA|5|Fit my new Forester Turbo seats amazingly.
B00DPLE4LW|4|These bars are great.  The only issue I have is that the paint is easily scratched, but they are solid. I bought the smooth option(forgetting that Harleys use dimpled bars for the wiring) so I did have to do some drilling, which I had to stop a few times to sharpen my drill bits( like I said, very solid thick Guage steel) I put them on last night and they look and feel perfect. I would very highly recommend this to anybody who rides a sportster.
B000EQR87S|5|Fast shipping. ..arrived as advertised.
B00SVEXLZS|4|Thought it was metal Keychain not rubber but i under stand why. Rubber don't scratch your bike good thinking.
B005TTZDWW|5|Easy install. Quick delivery.
B000KL7336|4|Fits my 2014 Titan great with enough room to be able to put the under seat storage bin in.
B010JK2DP0|5|My Husband just instaled these the other night and it only took about an hour. I LOVE THEM. I would recommend these to anyone. The price was great too.
B00MZ1NAH2|3|Nice product
B0016ZJ4UK|3|Worked well
B0087XOTWW|5|They don't get hot and my battery lasts forever. The more expensive LEDs don't put out much more light, these are awesome.
B008LPEZ6Q|5|use this for quick wipe down.  love this stuff.
B002N5L9N2|5|Easy to use - doesn't leak.  Three point pressure coupling design replicates the RV's discharge end.  I looks durable.
B003Y8RC06|5|Second set I've purchased. They're fantastic and match my Willie G. Theme...even though they're zombies.
B00144D77E|5|Works Great, easy to install I was back on the lake a hour after I got it
B00FQQDOQU|5|Look great, though I do get a light flicker when opening the doors, unsure what that's about.
B00FUKZKEG|1|Weak sent very week,
B001KQD7TY|5|Very easy to install. Working well so far after a couple of months.
B005JU5V6E|5|Super easy to install and they work great!

B0019IA99O|5|Works
B0009IK5VW|1|One of the wipers practically blew up in the middle of a rain storm. Luckily we were close to a store that sold replacements when it happened. Would recommend a different brand to others.
B0034ZO6KI|5|good quality
B00062Z5E8|5|Great product. Works as described. I love how all 4 bulbs stay on when the high beams are on. Installation was a breeze.
B007OZLI4G|5|Great product..
B00SNLIPFA|5|Fit my paceman perfect.
B00BOWN1LI|5|Love it!  Everyone takes a second look and wants to ask if it's real.
B001NZZAGU|3|All parts worked great and was shipped quickly
B004Q76RGY|5|Great product.  They do fit the 2015 and are the OEM factory racks.
B00GXL61RQ|4|Nice mats, installed simply if you follow instructions.  Make sure you clean the boat floor with either Xylene or Acetone to make sure there is no residue and the adhesive will stay put.  You may want to cut the mat for under the seat into 2 parts so you do not have to remove the seat post. So far they are holding up well after 1 month. Warning: the adhesive is VERY aggressive so make sure you are sure of location, there is no going back once you get more than a little edge down.
B000C542NY|5|Great product .I replaced my Ball joints using ones from the parts store and all 4 needed to be replaced after 2 trips through the trails. Then I replaced them with these Moogs and after 6 months of trail driving they are as good as new. The Jeep Wrangler I installed them on has a 2 inch Body and 3 inch Rough Country Suspension Lift. I beating the bag out of this Jeep. Jeeps are known for breaking Ball Joints so I recommend to anyone  that drives any 4x4 that when it is time to replace your ball joints spend the extra $2 and get the Moogs. It will save you money and time in the long run.
B002S70MP6|2|So my air is cold but the gauge was messed up which in turn caused me to over charge my AC and I'm still having to deal with getting my AC system back down to the correct pressure so I don't bust my compressor.  Also the hose is way to short and I pretty much had to lay on my hot motor to attach the can to the line and hold the button down to fill my AC.  Will be using a different brand next time.
B007KPERVG|5|I would buy them again! nice!
B00458DTII|5|VERY NICE!
B001OKD8VI|5|Exact fit , and great quality, and fast service !
B000BKC2D2|3|Careful prep work seems to be the key. The repair worked through the winter and through most of the summer. The repair just failed after the 10th day of 90+ heat.  I'm going to try something else.
B001B78UMQ|5|Work great and fit great.
B002P8H7QU|5|This mirror was a perfect fit for my girls 2009 G-6. Plug and play, couldn't have been simpler
B00SBZRELY|5|If you own a boat and refuel at the dock, buy this product. You will not regret it. After years of breaking my back, standing crouched over trying not to spill any gas in the water while the boat rocks and bobs in the water I finally tried this on a whim. It has never been easier to refuel my boat.  My neighbor saw the product and bought one the next day.
B003VVLGZ8|5|Work like the original
B00IS93BCE|5|It is an excellent product with rugged looks and function.  I mounted it with a 9500 lbs winch and it looks great!
B000S2OSDK|5|This &#34;OE&#34; brake line matched up to my 2003 Chevy Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck. There's a slight difference from the production line installed hose and this OE hose, which is the steel line that connects to the banjo doesn't have as much of a bend in it where it conforms around the brake caliper. This doesn't complicate anything, it just reduces the clearance between the line and caliper. So if you compare the hoses, it might seem it might not fit properly, but in my case, it did.<br />My only dislike about the brake line is the included copper washers. Would have preferred steel.
B00BJNT6WK|5|Excellent
B007Q8HUK2|4|Expensive, but good quality.
B00F2ZHDU8|5|Slightly cheaper at some of the big box stores.  This stuff is awesome though. For someone who weedwacks maybe once every other week premixing a gallon of gas would last a year or more and I'd have to throw out the gallon at the end of the season. Plus I never quite got down the perfect ratio I feel like so sometimes I'd make a smoky batch over the years that would fowl my plug.<br /><br />This product solves all those problems.<br />It's small enough I don't waste a bunch<br />It lasts through out the year<br />It really doesn't smoke at all<br />My weedwacker is good to go for next year at the end of the seaon
B000COMX3Q|5|Well-made, and in a set of 5 so that we had a lock for each wheel, plus the spare.  Can't be too careful these days - people steal things if it's easy.  We just put new tires/wheels on our boat trailer ($500+) and I knew they would disappear if we didn't lock them on.  This set was perfect for preventing that.  I keep the wrench in our boat bag so it goes wherever the boat goes, and it fits two sizes of lug wrenches.  So far I haven't noticed any balance issues with them on the trailer - but I also haven't towed the boat at higher speeds yet.  Not much of an issue other than tire wear, if they do bounce a bit - the boat won't care. :)  Definitely well-made and worth the investment.
B00BFLVYRG|5|perfect fit fast shipping
B00EM3E296|5|Is exactly what I needed.  Works as the description states.
B00N08VYUY|4|did not have enough of the smaller caps to finish motor. but what i got on is very cool and does make a differance in looks.
B0070N2YTU|5|So far so good! Perfect match to the one that burned out. Easy install !!
B00N9LMXUC|1|poor quality
B00H7LPKKU|5|40 some odd years I have struggled with my darn grease gun, many times putting more grease around the irk, than into it.  My friend at work told me of this product.  I have thanked him immensely.  This darn little thing has eliminated a life long issue in greasing my machines.  IT IS SIMPLY AWESOME.  If you do any amount of greasing machinery, this is worth its weight in GOLD.
B000NTLH6O|5|This is a Ford Factory part and fit perfectly. Unfortunately, Ford knows this part frequently fails and, due to its location, replacement is a 5-7 hour job which requires removal of the center console, shifter and dash, along with disconnecting the steering column.  There are thorough videos on YouTube of how to replace it but, unless you have a decent knowledge of auto mechanics, I would recommend professional replacement.
B0055DMAU0|5|So far so good. Seems to work well.
B005U30NTU|4|easy assembly well constructed very poor assembly instructions
B00CG5RYEW|1|It was junk didn't even work even took to a pro still had to order from someone else it worked great rating of half a star only because got here quick
B00BP5QMHO|5|Helmet is great, shipping was fast.
B0045K2Q9Y|3|Great product, received it on time and is as good as it's advertisement.
B00CE6UMME|5|I love this pair of gloves, for summer time they are perfect. comfortable and light. Good Product. and they match my Green Ninja Zx-10R
B003L35936|5|Really food oil filter
B001CSKEOQ|5|Nice.
B00CFCHT0U|1|Doesn't fit a van well at all
B003TKXGEU|5|Looks great and sounds great also. Easy install. No modifications what so ever.
B0083CJAOO|2|Price was good, but many lights quit working in first few weeks. Still using just not satisfied. Too much hassle to send back.
B002NGCO30|5|UPDATED 4/2017: 5-star rating stands. I have had this same charger for about 2 years now, in fact mine still has the single LED bulb! It not only survived cross-country moving trip, it has jump started my car/my girlfriend's car/my parent's car/2 random strangers cars probably close to 10 times by now! It resides in my car's trunk and I charge it maybe once every 3 months. It is extremely easy to use and holds its charge great!<br /><br />Great tool to keep in your car since it does more than charge your car/pump air into your tire/act as huge flashlight/provides power via USB port/3-prong outlet.
B000PJEWVE|5|Bought a set for my son's Jeep.  These are heavy duty and do the job.  I can't comment as others have regarding copper wire, are they professional or whatever.  But, I wanted a heavy set for my son.  They work great.  Now that said, the parrot claw takes some muscle to open and to place on the battery terminal.  My wife would have to use two hands.<br /><br />I like the parrot claw as it works best, in my opinion on both top and side post batteries.  No slippage.<br /><br />You can get less expensive cables or pay more.  But when it gets down to 20/30 below zero, you'll appreciate having a good set of cables.
B00G0992B8|5|Excellent products. A+++++++++
B00H6ETIWY|1|the mirrors are hard to put on and adjust you have to losen the bolts in side yo adjust then and the screws to mount the mirrors with are not long enough
B00MVN5LAI|5|Love the tint and fits perfect.
B001BLT24C|5|Awesome mod for my car. I used them as high beams and for flash to pass<br />MKV VW R32
B000NVW1LM|4|Really Works - Saved lots of money and time by using this chemical fix.
B000MNN4WQ|5|Work Great
B00NDB2PYC|3|Not worth the price
B009HBNADC|1|My decal didn't last a month. It started peeling and would not stay down. It was a waste of money.  I am extremely disappointed!
B001C6JCQO|5|It worked perfect glad I found them
B004RFKBEO|5|Great product for hauling 4 bikes OR a cooler and other camping gear. Make and finish is very good. Take your time putting it together, and do not tighten the nuts tills you are sure you have the way you need it. Also keep the ratchet strap and hitch pin safe.
B000WJ75J8|5|This bag met my needs perfectly. It covers the entire area under the Ruckus seat and provides plenty of storage.
B00JLJS5V2|5|Bought these for my 08 ram 4.7. 6 out of 8 were bad and the dealer said I needed to replace the entire coil pack to get new rubber boots. Glad I found these, it saved me money.
B00K6OXSG8|5|Perfect fit.  I highly recommend.
B00LVTVLPM|5|excellent cover for my 07 yz450f, the XL size is more than enough even with my dirtbike on a stand, being a veteran in the army i love the digital camo pattern, more durable than the last cover i had, & affordable, thanks Amazon & leader accessories
B001CF1A6U|5|High quality at a reasonable price.
B00ELJ60RI|5|sticker says it all
B004X5QLVU|3|Good fit. Not heavy duty, but adequate. Original radiator cap did not fit. Had to take to the store and try several before finding proper one. Info would have saved time and frustration.
B009S7IJJA|5|Fit my Cardinal 5th wheel great.
B00CQLML6W|3|Received the part within the advertised delivery window.<br /><br />It works fine - with a quirk.  I installed this on the right-rear door of my vehicle.  That window can also be controlled from the driver's door.  However, somehow this switch has reversed the functionality of the switch on the driver's door. That is - up is down, and down is up.  So, to elaborate:<br /><br />Before replacement of right-rear switch:<br />Right-rear switch: did not work<br />Driver's door switch: worked normally<br /><br />After replacement of right-rear switch:<br />Right-rear switch: works normally<br />Driver's door switch: works, but directions are reversed<br /><br />All in all, I would happily take this quirk and a $25 part rather than pay the $150 for a switch that Nissan quoted me.  It has only been installed for a week at this point, so I can't comment on its longevity.  Build quality seemed so-so, but acceptable.
B003L2ZQ2Q|5|Best Oil On the market
B0002MA8UI|5|Worked for what  I was  looking  for.
B005G5SD7Q|5|It only took 15 minutes from start to finish to install this product on my 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic.
B00B5NPL7I|5|Came out great in my 2011 VW Jetta
B000C7YAKC|5|Installed easily and works well on my 1988 renix-era Cherokee XJ 4.0.
B00E1ETJNU|5|Work and look great. I have them on my Red Ford Focus hatchback that I am slowly but surely adding more and more black accents to and these were a perfect addition.
B00CQ7VG8A|5|Everything went excellent. No problems at all.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Cheap, Reliable, worth the investment.<br /><br />I came from a bulky sun shade and decided it was time to free up some room in the back seat.<br />I'm glad I went with this option, it makes much more sense and definitely worth the (small) investment.<br />If you agree that saving money is cool, thumbs this review up!!
B001PWFPE8|5|This things awesome.  Easy to install.  Use the provided lock tire and follow the installation and tightening directions.  You do not need to remove the tail gate support cable.  I installed this on a 2010 Chevy 2500 Crew Cab.
B00VNBDVOC|5|They work great!  Huge upgrade over the HID lights.  No flicker.
B00MZT2TDK|5|it works fine. should float
B0006IX7Y2|5|Works well, as advertized.
B00UGJXPW0|1|Thinkness?
B00CCLMTNG|4|A lil smaller that the original but fits and works
B001F21556|5|The chrome on this Pro-One air cleaner cover is flawless and the cover is nice heavy billet aluminum. I bought the Arlen Ness chrome cover first and took it off immediately as it was thin, very light weight and also kind of concave in the center which was unacceptable for me. This cover fits over a K&N or Arlen Ness Big Sucker stage one filter as well as other filters of the same size. Mine is mounted on a K&N HD-0800. Hope my photo helps with your decision.
B004T39YX8|5|Great not having to go through the embarassment of asking for extender.
B007S0LDME|5|Notice a change right away.  Great!
B00480J4QY|5|I've had these for about 6 months and they still work great.
B00AKYOTU8|5|Delivered on time and as pictured.
B00JRD522C|5|Works perfectly.
B00VESOX8M|5|This Skyrim dragon was glossy black.  Nicely detailed vinyl with excellent instructions on how to apply. Once applied (on my computer case) you see a beautiful black dragon on the red pc case. Very professional looking.
B001O2F9OK|5|It's exactly what it claims to be
B000XEBI9K|5|This is the best cure for my neighbour who drives like a bat. My bumpers have been happy ever since.
B0013TNMY8|5|Worked perfect. Code hasnt come back.
B000C5WCUE|1|This sensor doesn´t work whit TOYOTA RAV4 2006, I had to buy the original TOYOTA PART
B00546C8UA|5|This was a perfect fit for our 2011 Toyota Rav4. It's convenient if you don't want to hear certain items sliding around in the back. It holds a decent amount of grocery bags. Just the other day, I was able to fit 8 2-liters of soda and the net was sturdy enough to not wilt and keep the heavy pops in place.
B0031I20EC|4|few inches bigger would been perfect.
B0076PXVKS|5|Perfect fit thanks!
B00B0QWXW6|4|If there where a way to protect the whole bumper it will be PERFECT
B000C5FJ36|5|Flawless!!!<br />Comes in Motorcraft/ Ford package unlike some of the others that claim to be OEM!!!<br />Happy Shopper
B005M20AH4|4|Worked perfect.... easy to use
B0009H51LC|5|Nice filter, works fine!
B00AAXKQME|5|It works great so far.
B004QA3YD0|5|The product was exactly as i expected.  Very good quality and at a fair price.
B002VHA3EI|5|Sticker was of a very high quality.  It includes very detailed instructions for application. I followed the instructions and the decal applied flawlessly.  I highly recommend the product and the seller.
B009NIM7Z6|5|Would of been better with built-in sun glasses. .
B00QYBSO8O|3|One of the boxes went out already, it gets stuck from the magnet and you have to smack it lose to turn on. Plus I had a magnet fall off. But all in all gets lots of compliments
B00G0AG2F6|5|You can really buy this simple set up anywhere but I wanted something that would be of really good quality and hold up over the years. This is a really amazing product. I'm not a huge fan of the yellow case but everything else is solid as can be.
B00CLSBW1U|5|as expected
B004GCP8FA|1|The whole grill is in the picture but I only received the mounting brackets.
B004PL4H0O|4|Cheaper quality than some does the job
B00BYNJAVW|5|Replaced a set of original Z71 shocks at 180,000.  These are a little more bouncy than original, but you get used to them and ultimately the last set of shocks I will put on the vehicle, so tighten the nuts and off you go.
B009S94W3U|5|LOOK GOOD,FIT WELL.JUST WHAT I WANTED!
B00NPPNJDC|5|These are really 12 watt lights. I tried them at different voltages and the current would increase/decrease to maintain the power usage of 12 watts. (1.2A @ 10V, .6A @ 20V). The only negative thing about these lights is the micro mounting screws (3.75mm screws with plain nuts)  I plan on tapping the holes for 1/4 X 32 machine screws.These are the first LED lights  (100+ lights) I've bought that meet the advertized wattage.<br />Update<br />Used one as a backup light on my ATV snow plow and another one I mounted on two 6&#34; spring clamp (floor standing or clamp on)and use it as a portable work/utility light with a 12V/4Ahr NiMh battery and an LED remote dimmer/control.
B00KGIDI8M|5|This is a great value for the money. Chrome is decent and alternator works just fine. At idle of 750 rpm, the output is about 13.6v going up to 14.6 at 1500 rpm. Only negative I could find are some pry marks at the case halves, probably from someone prying the case apart before it was chromed. It bolted up in place of my old externally regulated alternator with no problems. Price is really good for a chrome single-wire alternator with no core charge.
B000GARNF4|5|They work well. Made well too . Easy to use
B000CGM1D6|5|Worked great so far. been on truck for 30 days. Hard job changing out.
B0041TGN2K|5|Great price and exact replacement
B005WXPYTC|5|AWESOME!!!!!  THESE MADE MY SCERAMING EAGLE 110 COME TO LIFE....THE BEAST WAS RELEASED ....THANK YOU ...BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT WORKS GREAT!
B007O5GXOG|5|Love it.  It's bad ass.  Works well
B00MOYIZNE|5|I have a white evo x and it makes the car look so clean
B0017UBHQS|4|OEM parts for the low, low gotta love it.
B00DX8B1UE|5|Great price on the HL!! Installed this on my 08 Teryx. Very heavy duty
B0002LBKF6|4|I can't say enough fantastic words for this product its is simply a amazing !
B00B2Q106O|5|excellent and fit on crdi!!! 7 pax
B0009H51UI|5|A OK
B00BITR9LU|1|Poor quality
B000VL9WT8|5|THIS THING IS ABSOLUTLY GREAT.  fast and easy to use. Great coverage and keeps the rain out.  That's right.  Waterproof.
B0041DZYJO|5|am verry pleased with product fit perfect and is working great so far
B00BITHFN2|5|fit my 2000 4 door Blazer LS perfect
B002M3KSK0|5|Worked perfectly on our 2005 Honda Pilot.  Highly recommend.
B00CIMSGSG|5|Just what I needed!!!  For whatever reason, my Chevy 08 hatch just stopped working and wouldn't hold itself up...you can imagine how hard this was when you put something in the back and the thing kept falling down on you.  I found these on Amazon, matched up my specs, and within a few days, they had arrived.  SUPER simple to install and have been working perfectly!!!  These are alot cheaper on here than auto parts stores!!!
B001TLC12E|3|Seat covering is already starting to tear.
B0002U1TYY|5|my standard choice
B00029K01I|5|very nice!
B00RM327NG|1|The little feet on the inside of it which stick into the vents are all broken. can i have a new rubber feet.
B000COCTXA|3|This replacement is mediocre at best. The nozzles leak wiper fluid across the hood, rather than spraying onto the windshield. I have connected them properly, they just seem to leak at the ball-unit (the part that moves to adjust the trajectory of the spray). They get the job done, and is so-so value for the money. These parts feel much cheaper than the OEM parts on my 2007 Mazda 3, so we will see how long they last...
B00EZUL6ZY|4|Excellent
B005XXW9VM|5|Parts very good  Do not try installation unless you are an experienced mechanic as the instructions are worthless
B00C7Z0QAK|5|Just what I needed.
B00496LM62|5|Excellent OEM filter! Don't buy cheap filters! Not a big difference in price!
B0016J3ANS|4|Fits my 2001 Pathfinder but the pair is noticeably stronger than stock. You could probably get away with 1 if your hatch stays open on it's own with your old struts, mine did but barely. The bracket was different than the stock Stabilus but it still fit.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Awesome product!
B002BASW5W|5|Works very well!
B001NEYPQM|5|Definitely notice a difference! My 06 Mazda3 has better accelaration and the whistle sound is a plus. Was simple to install, doesnt take much time. Highly recommend it.
B005KWDE9C|5|I like it 4 bikes no problem
B0031HQ0PI|5|Realy easy repair
B005DJPLZM|5|I really liked this Mickey Mouse Auto Emblem.  And apparently someone else did too.  It was stolen off of my car in the parking lot at work one day.  :-(
B000E7BTFE|5|Fit like a glove
B00BSGJQ4Q|3|This was a test purchase of natural white for my sailboat. Compared to other warm white LEDs and the old incandescent ones, the light is a little cold, its tone does not work so well for me in any living areas, but it seems bright and fine for indirect light at workplaces, or inside a cabinet. Since I opened the box, I can't return it. It will be the first of two bulbs in a cabinet light with a 2-step-switch. As for electricity consumption, if I turn those 2 LED lights on, they hardly show on the amp meter, whereas the two old bulbs make the meter go up two steps right away.
B0006JLVFI|5|Excellent and easy to install. I highly recommend these over any made of plastic.
B00E1ETJPI|2|a bit big
B003TOFMLQ|5|worked great
B000CFO05E|4|Easiest install ever.  Works great.  They should give you an extra Tee in the package, but plenty of wire and connectors for everything else you have to do.  Kicks on and does its thing with a push of a button and is a great investment for ease of use and comfort.  I have it running helper bags and I have them up to 80 PSI with no problem.  Takes a little time to push air, but does a nice job or the price.  Good Investment and I would buy again.
B005VKLJUE|5|Described and priced right!  No problem part here.
B0088VUTM2|5|Works wonders, been using this product for years.
B001RM4RXQ|5|great
B001KS86VQ|4|these are great as a temporary solution if you cant afford to replace both mirrors :)
B00DERDU44|4|It is a fantastic spark plug though, will see how long it would last. The last time I've change the plug was in 2009. If this plug would last that long, then it would be the best plug of these brand in the market.
B0010HJUGM|4|A++++++++
B0027M2UI4|2|The cup holder not big enough
B001M52YRO|5|These work very good.  Best tool we have found.
B005HJL94A|5|I bought this to fix the flag mount on a Burley bike trailer. The original mount was rigid, and the flag rod had broken off at the base so many times that it was down from 4 feet to about 18 inches. The Springy Thingy has a large bolt that threads deep into a piece nestled inside the spring, making the mount very solid. (I had to drill out the trailer's flag mount a bit so the bolt would fit through.) There's a small thumb screw that holds the flag rod in place. The materials and fit and finish are all first rate, much nicer than I expected. Highly recommended.
B00G620ZVU|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00CAYBABW|5|These look awesome and are very functional. However, the grips they go with, Kuryakyn 6350, aren't long enough to comfortably accommodate this Throttle Boss. The Throttle Boss just seems like it is in the way so I don't use it around town. If I am going to be doing some long distance riding I install it. Only takes a couple of minutes, very easy.
B000CJ427Q|5|Make sure to replace your end links in pairs. This item is for your rear RIGHT (K90452). For the rear LEFT, it is K90453.<br /><br />If your car squeaks like crazy going over every small bump, it's probably your sway bar.<br /><br />First make sure your bushings are greased properly and have not worn down from contact with the bar.<br />If your bushings are shot, then replace them with bushings that have grease zerk fittings such as Energy Suspension.<br />They will last longer since they would be lubricated and you won't have to take it apart to grease.<br /><br />Next, check your sway bar end links. If the boots on your end links are ripped, then you need new end links.<br /><br />Right out of the box these end links are noticeable heavier and about 2x thicker so they can be used with larger aftermarket sway bars.<br />They also have a large rubber boot that is already greased but can hold a lot more grease than my factory ones.<br />These also come with grease zerk fittings so you can grease them instead of replacing them if the grease disappears over time.<br /><br />The end links also have a different installation system instead of your factory one that required a hex key and a crescent wrench.<br />These use a regular nut and you just need something to hold the other end when installing.<br />There are 0 chances of you stripping the end link which saves you a lot of trouble.<br /><br />I installed these on my 2003 Honda Civic Coupe.
B004DC7RTI|3|Doing the job i guess...funny smell
B00K802W08|5|Good!
B001AM8KAO|2|Install was easy and fit was perfect.  The only complaint I have is that the units are not independently filled...if you have an uneven load(despite trying) they'll hold the weight but you'll be stuck with a &#34;roll&#34; to one side.
B001C6NL52|5|Excellent in every way, same very high quality as when I bought a set a few years ago, no tool box of mine is complete with out one of these sets.
B00B7ORHNG|5|The sun cover is the perfect fit for the Elite 7. Fits nice and tight, I forgot to remove it when trailering to Freeport from Baytown, and it was still on when I got there.  Great product, wish it would have came with the unit instead of being an accessory.
B00029CYRG|5|works as advertised wish it was cheaper :)
B001R93K0K|5|It came in early and looks great on my car and my computer (bought 2) It was very easy to apply and it still looks great after several rain storms and a car wash
B001FCB4JS|5|reasonable price , fast delivery.
B004J07ZAU|5|Great scent. Cute addition to the car's interior.
B00JM623MG|4|Purchased this to treat my windows, mainly windshield, on my 2013 Focus ST. For what ever reason my windshield, from the factory, doesn't bead water well at all and when things like bugs or tree sap get stuck it's bad. I will say this product works better than the spray on rainx and better than the concentrate alcohol based rainx treatment. And it does last longer than both of those treatments.<br />However, not as well or as long as the rainx you put in with your windshield wash. Now that is to be expected since you can out it on whenever you want and I'm not talking about the rainx washer fluid. This is a concentrate bottle you add so much per gallon to any windshield wash.<br />Also, keep in mind my car because every car is different, especially the glass even in the same model car. I live in Ohio with all seasons and in the country with all the bugs. So I am asking a lot of the product as well.
B005NLQAHS|5|Been using this with the Torque and Torque Pro app for Android.  Works 100% with my Nexus 5 and my Nexus 6.  Buy without fear.
B00ONO664I|4|As expected quality product and looks absolutely great on my truck. Reason for the 4 star rating is the cover should be a little wider to cover the hole on top of the railing.  It only covers about 3/4 of the hole on both sides at the ride.
B00KFRTNLK|2|this Cat Back system is a good deal , but if you are installing it yourself good luck because you will not be able to do it ! I had to take my Accord to the muffler shop to have mine fixed , the resonator pipe wouldn't line up and the mufflers are on the wrong pitch , so they are touching the bumper . The right side is 4 1/2 in short so they have to add a extension so it will all line up . It is costing me an additional $250 to have it altered and installed , but compared to $800 for a cat back system it is still cheaper if you have a shop do it all for you .
B0087FJZUQ|4|I never installed them because I sold my truck but they looked nice. They seemed to fit well when i did a dry fit.
B0073VC6YM|5|Great Antenna! No need to worry about that garage door again
B000OCT7FI|5|These tools have saved me hours of labor as well as many dollars.  I've used them on small tires for my lawn mower and other small utility items and frankly, I doubt I could have gotten the job done without them. They are heavy duty and durable as well as easy to use.
B0022ZYXWC|5|This grease is the best for motorcylces, street and dirt!
B00CJLAXBY|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Not sold in different amounts like advertised for Amazon gave me a credit to use to get a 5 pack at a discount.
B0081SB3GS|5|Good condition!!
B0095D34YM|5|Work great and fit great. Much cheaper than the BMW OEM and lasts just as long.
B00MBV4CKK|5|We just love it!!
B0081OSTGO|5|Works well and makes 2 gallons, I made 3 to stretch it out and still worked for me.
B004XABM2I|5|Works and smells great!
B000FW61SI|1|the plastic is so cheap it distorts the vision and is very hard on the eyes.
B000MXYVEQ|5|Perfect gauge for my UTV's and ATV's.  Works great.  Very accurate or so at least I think so.<br /><br />I specifically bought this for my recreational units.  I indeed recommend this product.  Well constructed. Fair price for the quality.
B007VS0EDM|5|Awsome product
B000XRHRZQ|5|Good value,fit well.
B00BR4GHVE|4|I just installed and they fit nicely to my 2014 Dodge 1500 Ram. Its easy to install just make sure to pre-fit them without taking off the tape to make sure they align properly.
B00HNBXNSU|5|Great quality and very comfortable
B005C1H7T4|5|Initial thoughts:<br />Pro’s<br />1-Super easy to install if you take bumper off.<br />2-Very good looking lit and unlit<br />3-Great packaging<br />4-Except for below complaint Very thoughtful design (moisture prevention cups, all wiring included very well done and detailed instructions)<br />Con’s<br />1- Cannot put my own bulbs without modification. As decent as the free bulbs are they do not hold a candle to my Sylvania ultra brights.<br />2- Mounting of the included power modules should be better…. You have to figure out something on your own. BUT the 3m mounting tape seems to be holding.
B00IDHQ2Z4|5|Great product, quick delivery!
B0018C85VK|5|This was exactly the item I was hoping to receive! The description of the item seemed to be correct, but I've never replaced the Gas Springs on a Leer Pickup Cap before. As soon as I unpacked these, it was obvious how the locking mechanism worked on both ends and I was able to pop the original Gas Springs off and put these in their place. I don't quite remember the originals working this well! A superb buy - the items were shipped rapidly, safely, and at a good price.
B00J06MCE2|5|For such a simple piece of equipment, there are many ways to screw it up. Thankfully, this product got it right. It's very heavy duty in gauge and welding. Fit the trailer and 5x4.5 bolt pattern spare perfectly. Angle of the arm keeps tire well away from the ground. Comes with two sizes of bolts to work with trailer beams of different thicknesses.
B000F6F99G|5|perfect and works every time!
B00G0PQMHO|5|Worked great! No issues with installation.
B000KYX92C|4|Had my spare key and fob close by and it was de-programmed when the new one was being programmed. Absolutely cannot program in close proximitiy to each other. Actually, have not been able to program the other one yet. Not sure how to make that happen yet without doing a lot of walking.
B000BZG78I|1|2nd time purchase<br />Bad out of the box<br />2 friends had the same experience<br />Bosch needs to improve this product<br />Check engine lite comes and goes
B00XAX4B9A|5|This is my first car sunshade. I like that it folds to a small, convenient size and is thin. It takes up much less room when not in use that some of the shades my friends have. It does a nice job reflecting heat and light our of the car so the seats do not get too hot to touch. My only small issue is that I find it very difficult to fold up small enough to put back in the carrying bag.<br /><br />I have also used this sunshade to shade a window in my bedroom during a heatwave. The room would gain a lot of heat from the sun in the late afternoon and it would be uncomfortable to sleep in at night. The sunshade made it a lot more comfortable even though it is not the right size for my bedroom windows.<br /><br />I received a free sunshade to test and review. All opinions and experiences described are my own.
B000C2Y5IY|5|Perfect fit.
B00C8C6A7K|5|Installed a month now and works fine. Shipped promptly within 7 days.
B000F5LJ3M|3|Works well on smaller tie rod ends. does not work well with full size cars and trucks.
B00WT5TGG8|4|worked great, fast mailing.thanks.
B005ESZ058|5|I have not used the tow bar, I will use it to tow an old pickup I am restoring to places where I will have some of the work completed. Considering time and materials, I could not fabricate a Tow Bar for the price charged and free shipping.
B007R6JP2Y|3|looks great, but it wasn't very stable, bottom one didn't feel too well and I wound up getting both stolen, lol.
B0012P2KB4|5|Just what I needed for a 98 chev K1500. Heater and air blower switch. works good as new.  And you don,t need to buy the whole heating controls if you just lose the blower switch on this model. Fast shipping. all around good deal.Thanks
B00GSAUHB8|5|Best sunshade and easy to store
B005I5TW2E|5|Great quality product.
B004TRKBOK|4|Good value, have not used. Nice to have around in the event.
B005DUXZ2W|1|Too small for my 2008 Ninja 250r... had to buy different ones
B00FLFX1QO|5|These grommets fit perfectly into my friend's 2002 Nissan Maxima's radiator holders. They slipped in smoothly, but firmly.
B003LFJD04|4|Just received in mail. It's so cute. Not too big, not too small. Haven't put it on my car yet but I'm sure it will work fine from reading the other reviews.
B009DK8CEY|5|Everything was great
B0002Q86M6|1|Horrible sound can't hear when bike is started at all
B00QIWBJ0E|3|It is Very good, But need more screens to change out.
B00LG07MZE|3|Ugly, always super wrinkled (since new) and not easy to get in the pouch, but it does the job. Hopefully it won't break too soon.
B00PE0JPFW|4|As described, have not used it YET. One thing i would add is i plan on painting it a very bright color so i dont loose it.
B00GA7O7H4|5|This Stuff is amazing. Most other kits are more pricey. I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this product because it was realtivly cheap in cost. The results were far from that of a really cheap product. I hate the process of resealing motorcycle gas tanks but it is a necessary evil if you ever plan on buying used bikes. I use the apple cider vinager trick to clean out rust. A few days with a full tank of vinager and the tank has no choice but to be clean. I never need the rest of the kit I just need the sealer. This is one of the only sealers I have used that cured exactly how the supplier said it would. After two days of curing the excess did not harden and was able to coat once more before I drained it and believe me I prefer the color of white in the tank be because if there is a color difference in the tank, instantly I will know.
B00A1A394S|1|Does not fit a 2001 dodge durango. Cannot return.
B004AGAOE2|5|Met my expectations and that is saying a lot.  Reasonable price.
B00KGEF9S8|5|I like the safety aspect of this tool.  However, I have not had to use it so I don't actually know if it does the job.  It does lend me a sense of safety.
B00C2DSLCC|5|They fit easy install no more rolling the window down to get out of the car! I'm happy
B00AK90ZZ6|5|WeatherTech products simply do what they say they'll do. The window vents are easy to install, fit perfectly and stand up to the abuse of the ever-changing climate I live in.
B0083G7WIG|5|I just love when things work out right. I've installed tail lamps in the past and wanted to rip my hair out. This snapped in easily and turned on without a hitch.
B008MO64YC|1|This stuff is not very great at all. It won't fit over a tail light of headlight without creases being everywhere. The &#34;easy to apply&#34; is only for flat clean, smooth surface.
B00HYJWGLQ|5|Great dust cover for indoor storage. Easy on and off.
B000KKLLFS|5|Not much else to say- these fit, seal nice and tight, and great replacement caps for when yours magically disappear. I would buy again.
B00L6XZU0A|5|Great remote. It works very well for my 2010 Rav4 Base. Make sure to use a very good locksmith that can cut these keys by code and not by lathe.
B005EMOVHW|4|Perfect fit & look , would have given 5 stars but picture shows the place for the Scion symbol, which it does not have, it's smooth all the way across so I just didn't put the symbol back on but still looks great.
B00R6ZWS98|2|Product shipped on time, the product I received had creases in it and from being rolled air had gotten between the transparent paper and the decal it self, I laid it on a flat surface over night with a bunch of wieght on it trying to get a flatter surface to work with, I'm very experienced with decaling but every letter had to be lifted with a razor blade off the white backing paper i couldn't get the creases out and can't stand a decal that won't lay flat. None of the material is 3m it's the cheap stuff your friends mom used to make decals ten years ago. The product ended up going in the trash after I couldn't get the creases out. If you're an amateur with these decals don't bother wasting your time and money.
B005OT3K8Q|4|It arrived exactly as said to and is what I was looking for.
B00EWIPGGO|5|Great product looks great will definitely buy from this seller again
B00MWLEME0|5|The quality of the license frame was great.  It exceeded my expectations!
B0015353XU|5|I have been using this for one year now with no complaints.  It is used all day, everyday, to supply power to my entire house.  I have it connected to 12 Trojan L162V-RE batteries.<br />Thank you Go Power!
B0016ZBP1Q|5|Works great, exactly what we needed.
B001AZQAR6|5|Not too big, not too small. Shiny but not flashy.
B00153ZO0W|3|Fitment is not great. Product came misshaped from shipping do had to hear and stretch it. Needs a lot of prepping! Looks good when on once all is done. Hard to get tape to stick to valance.
B006X8BATI|5|Easy to install. Looks much better than the big hole that was there.
B0009IQZX4|5|its fram, its the best
B00AWWSOOA|5|A perfect fit for an 2015 Honda Accord 4 door!
B0055XHBHC|5|The mattress is very comfortable and my wife and I finally slept good all night.No back pain in the morning.
B00JV3U7VE|5|Logo fell out of the plate approx 2 weeks after I put it on my truck. The plate is now useless. Item arrived on time and in good condition. I am really disappointed about it falling apart.
B001GF7LYG|5|Fit nice and tight and folds up nice. Worth the extra money to get nice things that work well and make life easy. Gonna get one for my truck and other car
B00P815M7C|5|Fit perfectly.
B00N31IE4M|5|Perfect
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I think that the dimensions as advertised was misleading and therefore the two sunshades I ordered and received were too small for my vehicle. I have since realized that the correct size I need is the Jumbo XL 70x35&#34;. In the circumstances, I would like you to guide me accordingly.
B004MXN71U|5|Quick and easy swap out for our 2003 travel trailer.  Everything works like new again!
B00YOAY4XQ|5|I bought a 54&#34; curved off their website and it works great. Very bright and the brackets worked perfectly for installation! After a month of usage, no moisture has developed. I'll update if it occurs. Overall a great purchase.
B00MXP2XQ4|5|Very nice piece. Love the detail and the classic look. I will buy more of these.
B00EJA3BU8|5|Worked fine!.
B0041I1II0|4|Great
B00BMEVG1K|5|Very easy to put in
B00KIY33KM|1|Very low quality
B00KPZECVI|5|Took the blank down to the dealership... $60 later and it works perfect! Could not ask for a better deal.
B00AC6TJF4|5|Excellent quality
B00C8UF5FU|3|Lights work good.  There were no instructions and lots of wires. My high beam don't work. Takes more like two hrs to change on an f350. Lights aren't easy to adjust and don't point correctly. The lights would be five star if high beams work and easier to adjust with instructions.
B004K9ES7S|5|OEM.  Great look/feel/fit.  Heavy canvas.  Not the flimsy stuff!  Prompt shipping!  I would buy from this merchant again.
B00YNMBHSA|5|Excellent customer service, I had troubles but the fob came with a number for support. On a saturday I was quickly connected with a real person who sent me a new fob with no work on my part, it arrived a few days later and works great, very happy, thanks!<br /><br />One note, the Mazda logo is empty on both keys, likely a trademark issue, but should be noted as no pictures show that.
B002XLHUQG|3|I like the product, however, the bolt  threading is not of quality which makes it  difficlult to use. I hoping it will get better in time. I have never order mechanical parts in tbe past and probably won't in future.
B000X20CHQ|5|everything as expected
B003TPOU2W|5|Nice extinguisher. Mounted inside a small high performance car. Very secure mount. Thanks.
B000C7QGRC|4|Works pretty good
B00AR9F5HC|5|nice
B0002KL3Y0|5|Great quality good price.
B004SS8UUM|5|This was a gift for my husband and he appreciated the quality and sturdiness of the lanyard. It shipped and arrived quickly and has held up to daily use well.
B00E5OUOCQ|2|This does not fit my Honda Civic and I find that it really does not help to keep the heat out of my car.  Would not purchase again.
B00JRE38EA|5|If they don't work when you plug them in, turn them around.
B00HGHM468|1|Haven't had this very long. Worked great for a while then BROKE!! Thin plastic, buy the one without the Velcro.
B00BD6UH80|5|Good quality item.
B00EC102WE|5|Perfect fit, easy installation
B002XM3D66|5|Perfect replacement for the topper on my pickup truck. Took just a few minutes to remove the old props and install the new ones. Be sure to order two so you can replace both at the same time.
B000E2AJ6Y|2|Very poor support from the manufacturer. Item is drop shipped directly from the manufacturer, who included the incorrect install kit (correct item shown on invoice, so not the fault of the vendor). Manufacturer refused to correct the error, referring me back to the vendor, who could only correct the error by returning the entire hitch. Largely just an unfortunate waste of time.
B00KLSX3ZK|5|Great picture, easy to  install, good price and I love it I love it.
B00IPS4APU|4|Pros:<br />1. Easy to use, clear instructions<br />2. Worked as expected (90+% of the damage fixed)<br />3. Cheap!<br />4. Fully repaired in about 35-40 minutes<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Not a perfect repair, and not what the professional places can do, but works great for a home kit<br />2. Works best for star/bullseye cracks of 1 inch or less<br /><br />Summary:<br />Although my insurance will pay for windshield repair, I didn't want to go through the hassle of taking time off from work and going to a professional and getting it done, or the resulting slight increase in insurance premium for submitting a claim.  Since the crack was just a 1 inch star crack on the passenger side, I went with this DIY option.  The whole process took about 35-40 minutes, including the time to read the instructions once before proceeding, and taking my sweet time doing the actual repair.  The end result in a pretty good fill of the center defect and about 90% disappearance of the cracks.  Not bad for a home kit!  What was once a terrible eyesore, is something that you can only see if you're looking for it.<br /><br />One important thing about this kit is that it uses the UV light from the sun to cure the epoxy, so keep that in mind.  You need a shady spot to do the initial steps and then a sunny spot to allow the repair to cure.  The package states that enough epoxy is included to treat 3-4 cracks.  I would definitely use this again for small cracks.<br /><br />** UPDATE 3/6/16 **<br /><br />Last month my wife got a chip in the windshield of her car.  Pulled out this kit and even though it was opened months ago, the liquid and everything in the kit was still fresh and repaired the windshield as if the kit was brand new.  Just like the first windshield I repaired, you could still see a bit of the crack when I was done, but overall worked great and is hard to notice.<br /><br />I actually ended up trading in the car that I did the original repair to, and the guy inspecting the car at the dealership to determine the trade in value didn't even notice the repair.  I had to point it out to him (of course, did this after the deal was done and papers signed). Says a lot about the quality of this home repair kit.dealership to determine the trade in value didn't even notice the repair.  I had to point it out to him (of course, did this after the deal was done and papers signed). Says a lot about the quality of this home repair kit.
B000E322WC|5|The exact part...perfect fit
B003B800JE|5|Beautifully rugged and MADE IN THE USA. Great heavy-duty casters with two that are lockable. It's the perfect detail supplies cart.
B00BTLEHSK|1|This does NOT fit my 1999 GMC Sierra Z71 SLT. It says it will... It won't. Amazon's garage has been 100% correct for everything else I have purchased so its obviously just the manufacturer's incorrect catagorization. There is no way to remove my headrests without taking the seat apart, and the seat covers won't slip on over them. The seat covers don't have any place for my armrests. Taking the armrests off is ridiculous (not just a bolt on the outside, its a locking pin on the inside of the chair and extremely hard to access) and even if you do remove it you are forced to cut a hole in the seat covers to reattach the armrest... Janky. The covers for the backseat are just slightly too small. The headrest covers are the ONLY part of the package that actually fits. The installation videos on the manufacture's site are terribly subpar and only pertain to two different styles even though theres a plethora of different interiors (with/without armrests, attached/detached seat belts, split/single bench backseat, etc) The videos also only show installation on a car NOT a truck. Horrible and I will make sure not to buy from the FH group again.
B00AWX5E8I|5|Very solid which gives me a lot of confidence in its ability.  It took me about 10 minutes to install. Would have taken less but I kept cross threading one of the fine thread screws.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
B00SH1SN6C|5|This is a fantastic product.  I used recently one day when my battery died to jump my car three times in one day.  I liked it so much I immediately bought one for my wife and daughter.  I can highly recommend this product.
B00XAX4B9A|4|I wish the material was a little thicker, but it does fit very well, covering my entire Ford Escape windshield.
B00BTLEIIY|5|well worth the money verry pleased for the price
B0002JMUZW|5|It's a Motorcraft fuel filter. Can't say much more as the name speaks for itself.
B000C9K1N0|3|Even though the website says it will fit, don't buy it if you have stow-n-go seating.  It is way too short.  Haven't found the correct part number yet.
B000CANYOM|3|Seems like a good product, but it arrived with one screw missing.  That necessitated running out to a hardware store to get a new screw (it was a stainless steel, hex head screw).  It was kind of a hassle when you are trying to get underway.
B0006SU3QW|5|good quality works great
B004940ZSK|5|A++++
B00G4CLUZM|4|Great. Highly recommended
B008HZKP5A|5|Fit perfectly on my 2010 Rav4 V6
B002N1J5IM|5|Had a small problem mounting it on our Keystone Bullet RV, I had to modifiy the bracket a little, well worth the investment, it is very powerfull.
B00JY07PRI|3|recieved the product and it installed very easy on our camper awning.  attached the wiring and plugged in but it didn't work.  wiggled the wiring to the module and they flickered.  Removed the wires and reinstalled but not all the way as they had been install with the insulation pinched in the contact in stead of bare wire.  We then tried the remote but it doesn't work the code on the module is 0728 but the remote code is different, I assume this is why it doesn't work.  Waiting for answer on possibly reprograming the remote to match the module.
B00PYCXGSM|1|Already been through one disc in two months after only three uses at 3800rpm.  Plus they soak up all the wax, turning it into a wax blob.  Used just as I did the old larger pads.  The old larger pads were made much better, using them every month or two for over a year.
B00XVZYTLM|1|These were bought to replace Rv incandescent bulbs with more than a third of the LEDs burning out on first camping trip. Multiple flickering issues. Would not suggest buying.
B0066S1OG4|5|Like OE. Car is much cooler now, great price also!
B000HE6UNK|5|Very nice heavy duty cooler. The only problem is where to put it? It's bigger than I thought, and now I don't know where to mount the darn thing!
B004VS33JC|4|I ordered these for my expedition and have had them for quite some time. They were easy to install and I haven't had any issue with them. I received them sooner than I expected which was a great thing due to the fact I had a headlight out.
B002TO6HK2|5|Good sticker, well done.
B00HURY94O|5|as advertised
B005HR2FTK|5|Wife wanted more lights...who is going to argue with that. Installation  was easy. And we enjoy how the lites enhance  the bike.
B006LIYLL4|1|After only 50 miles. The lights burned out. Had the poor electrical wiring set up and what not all hooked up nice. Now I have no lights. I can find a way to contact them and let them know about. So it sucks real bad. There either junk to start with or something went wrong. No I did not touch the bulbs or the fuse is not blown.
B00BH2YW7C|5|Excellent fit. Easy installation
B00CA4U6OO|5|very nice key fob
B00INVEUNQ|5|Great 14 AWG wire.  Used to build my control panel.  Wish I had bought two rolls.  Great price, good wire.
B0010HI40K|5|Works as well as OEM. Same part as OEM without paying dealer price. Applied this to a 2004 Acura TSX. Highly recommended, easy and fast to install.
B00847TGXI|1|The ultimate car scratch is<br />wastage of money and time it doesn't work
B003AHDHQ4|5|Awesome! Easy to install! I use it every day!
B00BEW1O3A|1|Returned  this item as it only worked for a day. Too bad, the size was perfect.
B0075CWII8|5|Fits and looks good I'm going to buy another set for my other work van and they stay on you don't have to worry about them flying off on the highway
B00BWAPMNC|5|Only had it a couple weeks, but it is quieter and faster than all the others in the vehicle. Fit perfectly.
B00MB0EXGE|4|perfect to size, easy to install over your license plate
B004ZG8JL2|5|As described. Good product.
B008427D88|5|good product,fasr shipping
B00KS3BGAM|5|Did my dash in '93 Silverado with these. Have a new Indiglo dash not installed yet, wanted to try these with blue interior. Can mess with eyes, blue makes vision hazy turned up, use dimmer on low & OK for now. Had to try. Useing them other places.
B00R52M1DA|5|Excellent. Works perfectly for my Tundra with the 5.8L V8.
B00HSDT9FE|5|High Qualtiy.  Looks great!
B0071XQ4V8|4|A little difficult to understand installtion instructions, I found a video online and it helped alot. took about 1 hour to install, it works great on our 31foot Travel Trailer. Price was $200 less than Camping World.
B000760FWU|5|just what I wanted
B005H2L4V0|1|it doesn't suck up nothing and it sucks
B0012TUFQM|5|They work great.

B00IICYTDG|5|perfect no more screwdrivers
B000XY4ZGS|5|GOOD PRICE
B000C2ZJU2|5|Worked as it should. Purchased for 1996 Infiniti G20 as part of a normal regular tuneup. High quality part, which worked great. Should last at least 60k miles
B005FFT9IE|4|These fit great. The only thing I don't like about them is that the rear one piece mat does not extend far enough under the front seats. They also did not come with trimming instructions so I had to look up how to do that on YouTube...the center of the one piece rear seat mat needed trimming to fit around the console between the front seats.
B00KXERB78|5|Great product, thanks
B005H12QXG|5|OE fit and finish, simple install, and plug and play. Fantastic mirrors for the price, 2 for less than the price of one from the dealer.
B000EQVMZC|5|I've used this stuff for a long time across multiple vehicles. It works great, like a black sharpie marker in gel form.<br /><br />TIRES OR FENDERS OR TRIM<br /><br />1) clean your tires with a top rated cleaner, then power wash them well<br />2) allow drying time for tires<br />3) put on some nitrile gloves, apply Forever Black with a brush and even out<br />4) put some 303 spray on afterwards to protect<br /><br />BLACK TIRES<br /><br />Apply to the fenders, mirrors, trim on JEEPs . . . BLACK FENDERS<br /><br />It lasts too.

B004JBWYLE|5|Perfect fit
B0040CTTH4|5|Oh you need this if you plan to remove any panels in your car. Fits perfectly in Toyota. Only difference is OEM is white and this is aquamarine.
B00V30J86I|3|I have a volvo xc60 and it doesn't fix very well. too tight.  Since I have already thrown the box and etc. away I guess I will try to find someone else that can use it or just throw it away.
B0041FCNU0|5|Worked great and at a reasonable price.
B00S1NT2SE|5|made the adjustment a lot easyer
B00CEK88DU|5|Easy install for me. Fair price. Fast and safe shipping.

B00GTV5BBM|5|Fast Shipping, good product, excellent service.
B000C5I2YO|5|Fit my 2008 F-150 even though at the top of the page it said it wouldn't. It measures 4 3/4 in. X 2 1/4 in. although the measurements on the web page state very different measurements.
B00D3298A0|4|nice quality.  Only thing I would have liked is deeper ridges to trap dirt and water, but overall nice product
B003ZUNAVS|1|Good price not good resistance, after one week air spring it get chopped. I will uninstall and send them back. I need a kit 88228, this is the good kit.
B00TPUX3VY|5|Classic Accessories are in my experience well made, thick fabric and good accessories.  This cover has tapered corners to attach to the roll bar, and uses velcro to do it.  It holds on good even under speed/wind.  Cover itself is very thick, has a waterproof backing and looks like it will hold up.  Black is a nice color to match everything, but for keeping sun off you it might not be the best choice since it absorbs a lot of heat.
B00KQ10BSY|5|Fits nicely on the hump and love the extra space to put things.  The underside has little bumps that keep it from sliding around.
B003LMJP4Q|5|There is no better combination with m105 m205, End of story you can't go wrong
B00HYIGT7Y|5|Good quality to cost ratio. Works good. If I need more I'll buy these.
B0085EJ9Y6|4|It is, what was expected
B000W1R1J0|2|I was rather disappointed in this set.  It was too flimsy for my liking and I ultimately ended up returning it.
B002FDGQGM|5|Great sound on my 2015 kawasaki ninja 636 I thought it was too loud at first but after a few days you get used to it.overall great exhaust
B00L1S0JU6|2|It was okay... wasnt worth the expensive price tag... i can find a towel a lot cheaper and a lot more for the same price
B007RVTBV4|5|perfect
B00NXRXH20|5|SilBlade FLX 2119 Premium Bean Wiper blades were quick and easy to install.  I love the fact that they come in a two-pack with the &#34;exact different&#34; length blades that my Camry takes.They work beautifully in the rain.  No streaking, no smudging, just a clean wipe as the blade contours and hugs the windshield.  I've had them on my car for a couple of months now and they're still working just as well as they did the day I installed them.  Have yet to test them out in the snow/ice and I'm hoping I won't find out how they do in those conditions!  I will be purchasing a set of Silblade wipers when these current ones wear out.  Great product, and a good price.
B000CPI5ZK|5|I'm seeing a few degrees cooler temps on my 63 Nova
B00C6MPP00|5|These fit great, way better construction than the stock ones.
B00413B9XY|5|great idea and a lot lighter than most others and does a great job of stabilizing my 5th wheel, and shipping was excellent
B009XZVZJS|5|Looks great on my red Mustang. Had to replace them twice as someone else must have also liked them and &#34;borrowed&#34; them .......
B000KPVFG8|5|Thank you love this.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|It does everything it is described to do.  It keeps your car a little bit cooler...Keeps the steering wheel from getting to hot to handle.  However, the bag it comes with is kind of hard to keep putting the shield back in.  It seems to take a little to much time.. so i just forget about the bag.  The shield does have a string that keeps from unfolding.
B007CVSE30|1|It doesn't work for my Ford Ranger. The load must be the perfect size for the net to reach the eye hooks and it doesn't stretch. I am back to my 15 years old bungee style cargo net. That will adjust to any size load.
B00OXZDIE8|5|Purchased for 1996 Infiniti G20 as part of a normal regular tuneup. Super high quality part, which worked great. Definately will buy again for my next tune up. This filter is the same size as the oem one and feels extremely high quality.
B000CF1WB4|1|Plug end does not fit 2008 Mini Cooper (R56) post-cat oxygen sensor stock wiring harness. If you are willing to cut off the harness and wire it up, it might work - but you won't be able to return it if it doesn't resolve your problem.
B00NFA5WGO|3|Very slow when running takes 10 seconds until the lighting is working properly. Features easy to install and does not require any effort
B009DK1CC8|4|Item was as described, fit perfectly, and works as it should.<br /> A less expensive alternative to a parts store or dealer.<br />Would purchase for our other vehicles
B000GV7AVA|3|Not quite as bright as I had hoped
B00PSRORH2|5|Literally just unfold, press and stick to window. Very happy with the product and price!
B004IVGA0G|4|Guys my f150 but the portion where the pole goes it's pretty large
B003Z9UUUS|4|Easy to install and seems to be reasonably water tight.
B000C9XZ6K|5|Happy with filter - is doing it's job
B001RBCU90|5|This is my favorite!!
B00L6F09G8|5|direct replacement of origionals
B00J2CI5EU|5|Good product! Shipped fast!
B00G8WLX78|5|I've used this several times and it's awesome.
B00GSAUHB8|4|it is very nice, a couple of things that I thought would be better:<br />1. I thought that the inside the car would feel colder with the windshield, it actually feels really warm<br />2. the right side for some reason doesn't stay attached to the window, so, it is not as good as the left side.
B00B3VU910|5|Brought for my wife's car, she lliked the way it looked on her car
B0033HZQUG|5|aaa
B004C24GIO|5|Very easy install. The hardest part for me was getting my fingers in to take the Fi connectors off. Would absolutely recommend this product.
B00415I2XC|5|Awesome and easy to install.
B004IC4GWY|4|I bought the wrong key
B001AI3KUS|5|Was surprised that it fit so well.  Only installation issue was with the existing mounts being damaged.  Once straightened, it went in easily and the performance improvement is noticeable.  Picked up about 2 MPH,  and faster on the turns and after airborne jumps
B00A5Y2BEY|5|Holds up great and is funny
B00HKSCUNK|5|Just as advertised.
B004KEKYWQ|5|Hella products ++++++
B000C5O1VW|5|It was a replacement spark plug.  It came undamaged.
B0040I4ZEK|5|Direct replacement part on my 1997 Wrangler.
B00FC22AS6|5|After having issues getting the bulbs to lock into place, I figured out that the back of the bulb comes apart to allow for the factory locking ring to work. The brights are dim and the dims are bright, so now I need to change the 3 wires around on the harness. I bought these for a 1998 Ford F150. With all of that out of the way, these lights are BAD A**. I can definitely see MUCH MUCH better now. I ordered the 6000k which are a very bright white. Customer service is fantastic and was quick to satisfy me. I had originally left bad feedback, but quickly retracted it due to figuring out that the lights come apart. My only complaint now is the installation directions should be better. I'm now hooked on these lights. Now to see how long these things last.
B001GC2LVM|5|These things are awesome. We have used them twice now and they have been the difference between a good nights sleep and a back ache. Highly recommend!
B00R8WBUGG|4|These blubs are bright . Keep note they are long . And deep blue . Really like them but will have to go with the ice blue led JDM star sells . Not trying to get pulled over the blue pretty close to police blue lol
B00HEBEMA2|5|Great product, fast shipping
B00L9CQGD8|4|look good. not too flashy.
B003V16KK4|5|Works great!  Thank you have for having this item!
B007RW3KJM|5|Got this for less than the store sold it. Works great.
B00HKU83BG|5|I like
B00BTSFUD4|5|Fast shipping, exactly what I expected.
B006LGKIM2|5|perfect
B0080AUJ3A|5|Great Product!
B0057HQ3AW|4|These are half the price of a pair of OEM. They come with all the light bulbs and sockets. The main headlight looks like it could be configured for other bulb types.
B00BYG73BS|5|very smooth but firm and precise shift i had a 2-3 flare before i installed this now its perfect<br />had to drop trans down a little to get new longer pin in
B002TLUZGW|5|perfect fit! good quality for good price.
B004AL33YA|4|The threads are a little longer than the original so you would get like a half an inch smaller of a stroke. But a small hit to the grinder would fix that. Besides that its perfect
B003S8BFSW|5|Love the product. Key was sent in timely manner. Key works as promised after it was programmed. Recommend this product.
B00SKHSYEE|5|Just installed the tank on my 2006 cooper S.  Did it in about 30 minutes and I'm not a mechanic.  Took it for a test drive, no leaks, no over heating.  So far so good.
B002E5BVZC|5|Moves a lot of air quietly. Came packed well and there are a few YouTube videos that instruct you how to replace the blower.<br /><br />Best part, the stealership wanted $300 for the repair! $150 for the part and 1 1/2 hr. labor @ $100/ hr. All is cost me was the price of the part and 20 minutes of my time, yup 20 minutes is all it took!
B000JFL7ZS|5|Awesome product, highly recommend...
B000BQWLE6|1|Be careful of the size!!!!!<br /><br />I thought I was buying the 30 gallon one! This one is about the size of a soda can!
B002G47GE6|5|Fit my 2012 Volkswagen Golf perfectly.  Very quick and easy replacement.
B008214ZDW|5|Came in as promise, when promised.  Works well.
B007TY0G1I|3|It does.not snap together well. Some what cheap.
B00OKZC4SM|5|Perfect replacements.
B001HRMZ6M|5|Like factory.
B000XSCEJY|5|Quality piece
B00WWD12W8|1|received an oil filter instead... like, really?
B002UD0GGS|4|Worked very well to take scratches off the clear plastic covering the speedo and tach on my car.
B00A740VQM|5|Nifty set of small drivers which are a great value.
B00062ZNXG|5|Replaced my almost-big-enough filter that came on my truck with this one. Should have done it years ago.
B001FLZ1YI|5|Fit fine and had all the necessary bolts and spacers required.
B000H18DGK|5|Perfection! I love it when my Vette is perfect!
B00HLAGQCI|5|I couldn't believe that it was an actual Honda part. It work perfect. Very satisfied
B004D5Q3F4|5|As described.
B00DDYT7Y0|5|Very bright, awsome price and easy install.
B0054KSFI0|2|Not good for Kayaks. Snapped right off the car the first time we used it.
B000BGHYDO|5|Does a great job of a dirty job. Wear a mask and gloves. Recommended!
B00C10NYAK|2|No way this is 9.5 X 6 X 6 - more like 3.5 X 6 X 2 - when you purchase something based on dimensions, you expect the given dimensions to be correct!
B004VUC026|5|👍🏻
B004TA6YXO|5|Works
B006FUT0AK|5|I have always used Meguiar's products and I swear by them. They are cost efficient and work just as good as other more expensive brands.<br /><br />This is a quick spray mist detailer not a wax.<br />A detailer is used to remove light dust that settles on your vehicle the following days after you wash your car.<br />It can also be used to remove small bird droppings on your car but be careful not to smear it and scratch your paint.<br />It can also be used as a clay bar lubricant but it isn't cost effective and you should be using Meguiar's Quik Detailer Mist & Wipe instead.<br />[[ASIN:B0009IQXAE Meguiar's A3332 Quik Detailer Mist & Wipe - 32 oz.]]<br /><br />It seems as if this detailer is targeted for darker vehicles.<br />However, this detailer looks, smells, mists and wipes off the same as Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Detailer but is supposedly better for darker vehicles.<br />I see no difference and they are priced exactly the same with the same exact size.<br />[[ASIN:B000RXNLK6 Meguiar's G14422 Ultimate Quik Detailer - 22 oz.]]<br /><br />If you like product classification then be my guest and buy this detailer for your dark vehicles and the other for your lighter vehicles. They are exactly the same product.
B001OMVCIC|5|I am an avid tower I own a Dodge Ram 1500 2010 big horn package. I love these air bags because I can haul my tractor and skidsteer on my trailer with out crushing he rear end. I also use timbermen bump stops as well just to be safe and I hardly even need those! Amazing product must have for anyone with a Dodge Ram 1500 with coil springs. My truck is pretty much a 3/4 taken now. It raised my rear end a couple inches and it looks great!
B000KKF6L8|5|Item as described and shipped fast, they are lug nuts can't really talk em up too much.
B004LQPWA2|3|Was supposed to be an XL but came with L instead. Kinda snug.
B00IUE5OPO|5|I had my reservations about this stuff, but low and behold it works. Spray it on a cool surface, wait a minute or two, and you can see the dried bug jerky turning to an emulsified goo right before your eyes. Give it a wipe with a plush microfiber, repeat if necessary, then follow with your normal wash or detail spray. This will always be a part of my detailing arsenal.
B002EBSLA4|5|I love it
B001NI7KE2|4|The rack came quickly, and works fine. We have it over the grab handles, vs the clothes hooks.  It may be a bit lower this way, but I can see over it through the rear view mirror. No clothes sliding back and forth. I'd buy it again, for sure.
B002FE1J0E|5|Excellent! Arrived on the earliest expected delivery date. I had to use the old clips. No big deal. They adjusted great and make our car look new! I recommend these folks to all. Thank you!
B00LOS8US6|5|Was very pleased with it and was really impressed with the price. I give it 5 stars.
B007KTINX0|5|Use this every week to clean wipe down the car (dash, doors, steering wheel, etc) and it does a really good job of keeping dust off and it leaves a nice clean car smell. Its more of a manly smell, but not overly strong.
B00IGCW9V2|5|Perfect fit, right color, OEM! Thanks
B00C1YI2XA|5|super bright and very easy to install
B000E0Q3ZW|4|Nice shocks, decent ride...not much of a difference over the Monroes I pulled out of my lowered 02 Silverado.
B00KHUQDSG|5|Thank you for going beyond expectations.
B0007VNZN6|5|Exactly what I needed and what Iordered.
B00N2589OO|5|this makes it easier to keep my car air up to par.
B004JB7AWW|5|Price Great and Work Good THANK YOU
B001JT5TQQ|1|This didn't even give accurate directions! Why would I want a car compass to point the wrong way?!?!
B00766H2RU|5|went on well and looks good.
B00I5CRLXO|5|Looks awesome and matches the pin stripe I cut to fit great product I will buy again!!!!<br /><br />Anyone wondering this is only 1 decal per purchase not 2.
B006CRT72W|1|One only lasted about a week.  The 2nd one is very weak and sluggish.
B00COYNZJ8|4|Have only had it for a couple of weeks, so I cannot speak to the fading of the image just yet. For the price, I think it is great quality and sufficient.
B00WAQ9RW4|1|Cheap & did not fit. I was unable to return the product.
B00OZ6SEF8|2|Didn't tighten on my Ford Expedition. Just spun past and kept turning. Luckily, it didn't strip the threads and the replacement from the auto store worked. Cost me time and stress as I had to stop, drive to the store and buy a plug.<br /><br />This would be 1 star if it weren't for Amazon's refund policy - Thanks, Amazon!
B004C24GIO|5|I put this on my 2013 Kawasaki Vulcan VN900 Custom when I added the Cobra PowerFlo Air Intake Kit and Cobra Speedster Swept Black Exhaust.  I installed all three easily in a couple hours.  They work extremely well together and have given the bike extra, sustained performance.  NO - I do not work for Cobra.
B00M0AKHAQ|1|Contrary to what the specifications say on the Amazon website, the i960 does not address supplemental restraint system codes for the Porsche 911 (997 model).  icarsoft technical support confirmed this when I contacted them.  Not sure what else it says it does, but really doesn't do.  If you need an OBD reader for your Porsche, but another brand.
B00OTYI9KG|3|Paint worked well but disappointed with the clear coat applicator.
B00K53DO78|5|It fit perfectly at a great price
B007IPL2U2|5|Works very well.
B00164XD12|5|Fit well no problems
B00151AFPI|5|Fits a little tighter than the original belt, but works just as good. Was my first time replacing a serpentine belt on my 07 Tundra, took a while to install, but I got it done!
B000EDOT7I|3|Still not a great way to store your plastic grocery store bags, too messy. But the system works and if you can hide it in a cabinet, it would look disorganized
B0068C3SMG|3|Looks good but ended up not needing it but it was good enough that i will keep it for a future project bike!
B002OAR9OY|5|This looks great on our RV. We had no trouble cutting out hole for hitch. The reflectors are stick on but they are strong and have stayed on.
B00KNLCZFO|5|Husband loves these... they look very cool when we open the doors.  We have had them since Christmas and they're still working fine.
B00V84CWYY|5|Good quality...on my car now: Representing our next President of the United States.
B008CE0TN4|2|I found this to be not so useful on anything but perfectly flat ground.
B0101U6OVW|5|Vote Trump!
B005FCIGX6|5|It's exactlywhat I was looking for.
B009HQ647G|4|perfect replacement, perfect fit.
B00DF8C25U|5|The gear was definately the problem. My old worm gear was fine so I didnt disturb it from the little motor. I did however watch a you tube repair video and It helped me with the actual taking of the speedo gauge cluster apart and that was very simple. It really is a simple fix. I was glad to get it working again.
B007QBSZ8U|5|Fits my 1997 GMC Suburban..works great!! Great price!!!
B007OXCIB0|5|It looks so real, no one notices, as long as you cut it and set it right. It has held in place on my car through several car washes, rain, heat, and it has yet to even look like its been touched.
B00C1F9DDM|5|My soon liked.
B006WPQMOA|5|Tried the Coleman porta potti first.  Ordered it from Wal Mart.  The pump did not work unless you took it apart and primed it before each flush.  Returned it to Wal Mart for a total refund.  Then based on numerous customer reviews ordered the Thetford 320P porta potti from Amazon.  It works great, and the superb quality is very obvious.  Couldn't be more pleased. It really is worth what we paid for it.  Should have stayed with Thetford the first time.
B00GBQ740Q|5|I purchased this about a year ago. I am very pleased with the fit on my 2014 Honda Accord. MPGs seemed to go up a couple but I have no real data to back that. I bought it mainly because I could not find a disposable filter for a decent price at the time. Very pleased with the purchase.
B00NVI8FPU|5|Guards arrived ahead of expectations and were just what I was looking for. Installation was simple for the 2015 Camry. No drilling and didn't even have to remove the tires. A lot cheeper than dealer and custom fit. I would recommend these Genuine Toyota Mudguards.
B004VDT846|5|The fit was perfect
B00B9EVWWQ|5|Fast and affordable
B0054SN5AA|5|Fit like a glove and quiet exhaust.
B00691O3W0|5|This was the correct item for my vehicle, and it was delivered promptly as promised. I was surprised, but not really dissappointed, to find the gasket portion that was not screen mesh was made of a cardboard type fiber, while the one it was replacing was metal. Still seems to be doing its job, so if you feel the need to screen the EGR valve input hole, I do recommend this product. If not, the gasket without the screen is only $1.50.
B009RN2TQ4|5|I feel satisfaction by using this product.
B00INVEQKI|5|Very useful for running new circuits in a car. Wire is good quality.
B001C6Q82U|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues.
B00AQZB0V2|5|Replaced a failed lift gate actuator with this part. Simple repair and saved a bunch of money by not taking it to the dealer or a mechanic.
B000CHJDI6|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '02 Malibu. No issues.
B00M9BIELU|1|soda blasted exhaust and prepped metal, stuff flaked off instantly on warm up, what a mess! junk product
B007KT2AQQ|5|Very cute...in l❤ve with cheetah print🐆
B00NDB2G6O|3|Not worth the price
B0062AYT22|3|the exhaust looks nice and sounds nice but all clamps had to be modified in order to hold. nuts on clamps striped out before they were tight. pipes could have been a couple inches longer.  could not put them all the in  just barely past slots so as not to leak.
B000CI52ZS|5|Good  price and great service.
B005UGTVT0|5|I love it love showing off with it
B0091Q3NCG|3|Only worked for a few months then wouldn't function.
B000BQR100|2|Ordered 2 sets. First one is ok, as described in the product page, the second one has a different reflective material which I don't like.
B0013REXSO|5|Love this product...........perfect for our Jeep!
B002KOFBTE|5|bought for daughter
B00WF9GOMC|5|Item arrived on time and as described.
B00LTU1QYO|5|This is a must for every DIYer's tool box.
B0011O0YDW|5|Solid and works great. Perfect for the working at the bench.
B000EVWDU0|5|I was looking at all these mountable voltmeters for my motorcycle -- 30-40$ for all of them.  I happened across this and thought it was a much more affordable solution and since I only need it now and then, why not try this --- it worked perfectly.  I have a cig-adapter in my tank bag, so I plug this in when I want to check on my voltages.  Boom.  Cheap solution that seems to work perfectly.<br /><br />Yes, I have to want to see my voltage and plug this guy in, but for what I need it for (trouble shooting) its perfect.
B006U0JU14|5|excellent
B00BD2UBVC|5|great lighting for what I need
B001DRNNVW|4|Was exactly what I needed. Fit and worked well
B008ESIO5I|4|Good price, fit and easy to install.
B007JMOTJK|5|Perfect!
B00NE49IAC|5|Worked great, fast delivery and great price!  Thank you
B003L36UGQ|5|I took a shot on the Slick Mist Tire and Trim Shine by Lucas Oil. Over the years, I converted from Armour All to Meguiar's then back to Armour All including some dabbling with Eagle One and a few other manufacturer's of &#34;tire shines.&#34; I use Lucas lubricants, and oil and fuel treatment products religiously and have never had anything but glowing success so why not try their care car stuff?  During summer months, I am accustomed to getting about 3-4 days of decent performance out of tire treatments due to hot, humid climate, lots of evening and overnight rain and 85-100 miles of daily driving. I have now used Slick Mist on four different cars. It is a good consistency- thick enough to hang on to the applicator and &#34;build&#34; on the tires, but not goopy and gummy.  It seems to absorb just enough- not laying on the surface and not disappearing into the land o'molecular structure- even in hot, direct sun. It looks great, in my opinion. On tires, it is not overly shiny, so if you like the glossy, wet look, choose another product. The Slick Mist (applied per directions), leaves a smooth, satiny look. On even really chalky, faded, oxidized plastic, the black comes back and stays back. The Slick Mist does not streak and splotch like other products I have used on the same surfaces. And, most importantly- I get 8-10 days of great looking rubber (a little less on hard plastics).  As an informal, unintentional, and very unscientific test, the first time I used it (about a month ago) I got overspray on my asphalt driveway. Those spots have been in the beating sun, driving rain... have had some heated basketball played on them, tons of tires rolled over them and they persist-  two big overspray spots, clear as day. Tempting to do the whole driveway to see if it holds up better than traditional seal coating!  A month of use and wear on all four vehicles and I am amazed at how well blacks stayed black.  Unless Lucas reformulates for the worse or my tires suddenly disintegrate (for which I would update my post!), I will never use anything else on my tires or exterior plastic/rubber. I was surprised and remain 100% pleased.  ****UPDATE (August 2015)---  I have attached photos of one of my vehicles (a 15 year-old truck) after THREE weeks of rain and shine with absolutely no re-touching on rubber/plastic. You can hopefully see that the tires look great and most of the plastic does as well.  There are the typical, white'ish &#34;silicone&#34; streaks on the front bumper cover and the rear mud guards are a bit streaky, but I am absolutely AMAZED at how well this stuff is holding up.
B007HRO438|3|fits great - just the wright adjustment
B008427D88|5|good replacements
B001AVEMZC|5|This paper seems to be as good as 3M at 1/2 the price.
B00G8S07FQ|5|Awesome sticker. You have to think to figure out it is promiting firearms.
B0002MABGE|1|This thing broke and fell apart the first time my dog knocked in to it. A total waste of money and now I can't return it. I didn't use it right away.
B00062ZDJ0|4|What was needed on a engine swap out.
B000NJAAIK|5|Wonderful item very easy to install
B00DJ5KE9A|4|Great device.  Display needs to be bigger and easier to read.
B00E63THQA|5|Husband loves it. It holds about the same amount as brita.
B000B917PW|5|perfec
B00KCQSOAA|4|Great seat covers...good fit,looks great and easy install.
B00BLZ9XQK|5|Worked great with my custom LED brake light and turn signal setup.
