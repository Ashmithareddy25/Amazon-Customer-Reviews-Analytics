B000UJ48VI|5.0|This is a racy film, but not too bad. The movie is well watched in our house over and over again
031606792X|5.0|A very good end to a very good series. It is a great book to get someone interested in reading. Teenage girls love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a video game for my phone and my kindle. I enjoy running around on the screen in what seems like a giant maze
B005QUQP76|5.0|Boyfriend loved this mouse for both types of games. There are many hot keys right on the mouse for easy gaming. Very sleek and has removable weights for personalized feel
B000W178XO|5.0|Johnny Cash is a legend and the music on this CD is just a testament to his status. Johnny Cash was amazing at any age
0385360169|3.0|It was a good book but this should not be on tape unless you are always going to be in the car by yourself and the windows will be up... Lets just say it was a little bit awkward when I left it on and was taking a co-worker to lunch
1451638450|5.0|Lois Bujold has been writing about Miles and his family and adventures for twenty-five years, but she still has plenty of new ideas to offer, as this book demonstrates.  It is about Miles's cousin Ivan Vorpatril (or Ivan Xav, as the heroine always thinks of him, using his middle name).  Miles makes only a token appearance.  Ivan has been seen before as the bumbling sidekick, but here he gets to be the hero of his own story.<br /><br />This would be a perfectly good place for a new reader to plunge into Bujold's world, because it does not require any knowledge of backstory (although people who've read the whole series, like me, will see plenty of allusions to earlier events).  Her language is taut, well-crafted, intensely readable, sometimes very funny (as in a throwaway comment toward the end about sea monsters being too stupid to learn that humans are toxic to them).<br /><br />It's not \\"Mirror Dance,\\" because nothing is \\"Mirror Dance,\\" by far her best work, but is more in the mode of the madcap adventures seen in \\"Civil Campaign\\" or \\"Cetaganda\\" without ever becoming silly.  The new character of Shiv, an ex-pirate from Jackson's Whole, is intriguing and fully developed; I hope he'll reappear in another volume.<br /><br />Note, this book occurs several years before the events of \\"Cryoburn,\\" so anyone wanting to find out what Miles does after that book's final scene will have to wait.  Sorry!  Enjoy this one in the meantime.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a very addicted game cant seem to stop playing especially whenb iam bored I would definitely recommend the game awesome

B009K6DKTS|5.0|I have had the occasion to meet Mr. Taleb in a professional setting, and I was was struck by his intellectual honesty. This book brings his views in the general world, and his insights are quite shrewd in my opinion.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|its very hard to navigate on the new kindle, and it doesnt show you everything posted- it just quits scrolling and i just cant figure some things out--i will use FB on my laptop-thanks
0446677450|3.0|I like it, gave me a few tips and ideas about money management n how I should spend my money... But since he filed a fraud bankruptcy I don't know if I should trust his words..
B006WQLH7G|3.0|i havent seen it working like you can on a computer, it installed pretty easy but i still havent been able to add my device to my avast account. I tried from my computer and from my kindle fire itself. I'm not sure its doing anything but i feel better with it on there...
B005TTEFRG|1.0|First If you like the original &#34;Conan&#34;, this is nothing like the old one.  Wish I would had rented or watched it at a freinds house before purchasing...but that option wasn't available to me.  Would not reccomend this movie to a friend or anyone else.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|why do we have to download a camera program on a device that has a built-in camera? (i have kindle hd8.9)
B0098VXE50|3.0|Charlize Theron...VERY good, Chris Hemsworth also does a good job, Kristen Stewart...I just don't think this was the part for her.  No real emotion from her character or her.  The plot is pretty decent...all in all I would watch it again and I would recommend it to someone else.  But, its not going to be on your top shelf.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|The storyline was intriguing, the cinematography was superb and I loved it. I bought it the minute I got home from the theatre.
B00008O89K|5.0|From reading other posts it appears this one is missing a couple of tracks from the movie.  But, the ones that are on here are VERY GOOD!  I love to listen to it when I'm studying or working.  I find myself humming the tracks long afterwards.  Definately would buy it again.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|loved this film and can't wait to give it as a gift for xmas - it is well worth watching again
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Love how they used all the other movies like Hulk, Thor and Iron Man and Nailed this movie together to make 1 truly outstanding film.  What a treasure.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Robert Downy Jr. is absolutely GREAT in this movie!  You will love it and enjoy and appreciate it for a long time!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Great Product very fact and exactly like described. would purchase again and again. I love this item it is great.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|You can't view the plans on the Fire HD 7'' If you're  team could check that out I'm  sure that would make a lot of people happy. Besides that that app works great !
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read this many moons ago as a young lad and am glad I took the time as an adult to come back to it!  An easy read for the most part, I did get tripped up in some of the dialogue as it was representative of the book's culture and timeframe.  It was nice remembering what it was like being a kid again as I followed Tom's shinanigans.  One important item to note is terms are used that are not considered politically correct in today's day and age.  Keep in mind these terms were accepted as the &#34;norm&#34; at the time the story takes place.  Don't get wrapped up over the axle about it...just enjoy the book for what it is...the adventures of a boy with a very active imagination and a lot of energy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it's the word of God,<br />It's easy to use.<br />Everyone should live by the word.
B000093FLA|5.0|Great
B005CRY2O6|5.0|My fiance' loves this book and I bought this one as a replacement for hers when it got waterlogged and the pages stuck.<br /><br />Now she is back in action!<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian, but she is.  This book is full of great tasting, healthy recipes that satisfy.
B004H83IM8|5.0|Great
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Like the rest of the books in the Game of Thrones series, I couldn't put this down.  Now where is the next one!
B004529NKC|5.0|Great storyline and dancing
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't as funny as the previews and trailers had made it out to be.
B001JV5B12|5.0|Great
B0096HIEE2|4.0|I bought this film for my girlfriend.  She's a huge fan of Channing Tatum.  I'll give him this... he's got moves!
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I liked the movie. I received the movie on time. The movie remind me of the 80's. It was Great.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|I really enjoy the Disney animated movies.  This one is no exception.  Still just a kid at heart I guess.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|I liked the movie. I received the movie on time. The movie remind me of the 80's. It was Great.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Meryl Streep portrayed her role as a submissive wife but also knows how to make her point so well.<br />Wake up call for those who are married for the longest time. There should always be an effort to keep the love burning and being sensitive to each others needs
B002QGUFWE|5.0|This is one of the best cds I've ever purchased, and that is no small statement!<br />What a talent this girl has!
B005FISC52|5.0|I grew up watching One Tree Hill. It began as a high school drama show and evolved into a mature, young adult series. I am sad it ended but all great stories must come to an end. Even though the show is over if you haven't seen the series you should watch it from the beginning!
0345803485|5.0|The first of the trilogy was a bit racy to read and seemed a bit strange. But as you read the following books, it turns out to be a fantastic story. I know many people who have read them again.
B0083DJWGO|1.0|It sounded intriguing when I read the Amazon summary but it's not at all what I expected, very analytical, a difficult read.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I loved Angry Birds but Bad Piggies is a bit hard to get the hang of in my opinion. Trying to build the machines to get to the end is pretty easy, getting everything in the level.... Not so much. I have yet to figure out the physics of the game making it possible to launch part of the machine into the air. Worth a try since it is free.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I can only hope my dogs think like Enzo.  Good book even if a little predictable..Confirms my belief that all dog owners should have two so that one is not lonely!
B0086700CM|4.0|Crazy and addictive! Touch controls on the Kindle Fire seem to not work from time to time, which is very frustrating.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly philosophical, metaphysical, and existential, this book will be adored and kept close to those those who are the latter as individuals.  Green is an amazing author, inviting us into the world of his best work yet, showing us both sides of the sword of love, cancer, friendship, parenthood, and existence.  Buy this book, along with, \\"Man's Search For Meaning,\\" by Viktor Frankl.  It will change your life.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|A good tale ! not quite as complex as some of his other novels but very entertaining none the less .
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|it looks awesome but I never truer to downloading it people say it is bad I think it is cool it is minecraft survival peaple!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|A little kid app shouldn't have the option to buy items for real money. This is just a disaster waiting to happen for an unsuspecting parent who doesn't pay attention and has one-click purchases activated. I lucked out and uninstalled this before my daughter made any extra purchases through the app.
0553582038|5.0|Nice book because of it's size, makes the print so much easier to read. I thought the price was excellent. Fast shipping.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|App works great.  Easily able to follow my activity using my kindle anywhere in house.  Glad I don't have to be stuck to my desktop anymore.
0553801473|5.0|Love this series and the size, price and the print all make this book a great buy and easy to see for reading.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Everyone in the house loves this game.  Everyone from the 3 year old to Dad have a blast playing this game.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Bought this for my 9 year old who loves Legos. She plays for hours with them and with the Lego Friends is able to play with Legos while being girlie!
B00138H68M|5.0|Get this album.  You won't regret....you should already have it.  One of the top ten albums of the 00's.  Superb!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As a long-time fan of Patricia Cornwell, I was starting to get a little bored and disillusioned with her books.  She was allowing Scarpetta's niece, Lucy too much power and focus in the books that should be on Scarpetta.  In the Bone Bed, Scarpetta was back.  She had the help of the others, though Benton is a bore and needs to go back into witness protection; Scarpetta was assertive and back in charge.  She fires a worker, she battles an FBI agent.  She tells the police how to do their job in collection evidence.<br /><br />Though I would like to see Scarpetta as more of the heroine she used to be, I did think that &#34;Bone Bed&#34; was more back up to par with Cornwell's earlier books.  I loved it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved this series, wish there was more.  It takes a very interesting and fast moving book to keep my attention.  This definately fit the bill.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect basic calculator. I have it on my kindle fire and it is a great size to help me with simple math for balancing the check book.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Almost everyone that has read this book has told me that its a must read. So I had to read it for myself. Truthfully, I found it to be repetitive with all of the sex and the &#34;Oh my's&#34;. I guess it wasn't for me.  I stopped after reading the the second book. I will watch the movie when that comes out.  Good luck Fifty Shades.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|the music is very good and nice song. I love it. Everyone should would buy this album. all the song are good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to play Minecraft on their tablet. It is not quite the full version, but you get a lot for the money.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|good effect and a lots of action. this one will went back in time to find his partner. but this friend is dead.<br />good comedian. I love this movie.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Ordered first season for my husband for Christmas.  He loved Body of Proof, so I hope he will like this movie<br />as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was an amazing book. Great read and I didn't want to put it down! Highly recommended!!! It's one of my favorites!
B000YHG72E|5.0|We have seen this movie many times throughout the years. We just had to rent it again! My kids are ages 8 and 10. They thought it was very funny.  I highly recommend it.
B0000542D2|5.0|It's the Beatles at their best.  I gre up in the 60's and graduated in 1970 so they were a big part of my youth.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Best books I have read in a long while.  Ingenious the way he worked the characters in with the historical characters!
B0025KVLTM|5.0|It's the Beatles - how could you not love it?  I grew up in the 60's, graduated in 1970, they were a part of my life.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I admit my expectations might have been a little high with this trilogy. With all the boom around me, everyone urging me to read the books, I expected something a little deeper, a little more complex... In the end, it turned out to be a nice enough read for summer afternoons. Entertaining, but nothing to get so excited about.<br />I
B004JY0KP8|5.0|The watch arrived on time and looks great.  I can't wait to see our son's face when he opens it Christmas morning.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|just a great historical, ironical, human, social series<br />what more can I say, recommend more and I will rent those also
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I have  a kindle fire and enjoy playing this game. It has a fun assortment of songs, some are easy and others seem impossible.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another really great book! Couldn't have been more excited to read this one!!! I can't wait to see what happens next!!! :)
1449410243|5.0|I bought this as an xmas gift for a hard to shop for cat lover. It was amazingly funny and a lot thicker than I expected!
0425263908|5.0|I love a good romance novel. My sister got me into 50 Shades of Gray and I loved it and was looking for a new book after finished reading the three. I found Bared to You and LOVED every second of reading it. My husband thinks I'm crazy because I couldn't put it down. No offense to all the Gray lovers out there but you HAVE to give this series a try!!!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I love this movie...especially around the holidays. It always puts me in a good mood. I wouldn't put it up there with love actually, but it is still very enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely I give it five stars. Can't wait to read the next series.  Thinking I will start it tonight.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Edge of your seat entertainment!  Definately not for the faint of heart (or youngsters)...be prepared for addiction, because it will definately leave you wanting more!
1455527475|3.0|Greg Smith expanded the fifteen minutes of fame he earned by resigning from Goldman Sachs in a startling 1500 word New York Times editorial and has written a 250 page memoir titled Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story. All memoir becomes a matter of perspective, and Smith's junior role at Goldman gave him a perspective that represents one slice of the firm and one set of experiences. Reading this book is like eavesdropping, bringing the reader into places where we might not normally be, to the point where there was entirely too much recollection of chatting at urinals. Yuk. That and other unnecessary contexts pack this book with anecdotes that meant something to Smith, but not to many others. His main point is that his values and the behavior he saw at his company became misaligned. From p. 236, \\"I knew in my heart there was something deeply wrong in the way people were behaving, in the way they didn't care about the repercussions, in the way they saw their clients as their adversaries.\\" Readers who want an inside view of Goldman will get a sliver here. Readers who like a coming-of-age memoir are likely to find this one interesting. Any reader expecting the revelation of secrets won't find them in this book.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game it is a great game but I think it costs more money than its worse<br />udhhdgdhdhhdhdhhdhhdhdhjd<br /><br />&quot;
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It really helps to know how long it will take to charge my kindle and also how much charge I have left. I love the app.
030758836X|1.0|I read the whole thing- I'm sorry I did. Part 1 was mysterious. Did he do it? What does he know? The rest of the book just gave me bad feelings, bad energy deep in my core. What a terrible read - what evil energy was created from these two characters.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Cool product!!! I would definitely recommend it to all lego and volkswagen afficcionados. A nice addition to your toy collection too!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The season moved along at a heart pounding clip. Great turns and twists. Hanging on the edge waiting to see what happens next!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We had a wonder few days watching this program on dvd. Prompt delivery and good price made this a good deal
0425263916|5.0|I have not read this book yet, I am waiting for the third one to come out. I have read the first one, this is a very good series.
B00000612P|5.0|The impact made by Rod Stewart on the music scene of 1971 should never be underestimated. When \\"Maggie May\\" rang out from radios all across the world you just knew that something special had happened. For those of us too young and unaware at that point of \\"An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down\\",\\"Gasoline Alley\\" or work with the Faces and Jeff Beck Group, the voice of Rod Stewart rang straight and true. It was a voice of integrity, speaking to you and for you. Here was a translator of songs who made them his own (\\"Seems Like A Long Time\\", \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\", \\"Reason To Believe\\"); a creator of songs to rank with the most critically aclaimed (\\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\", \\"Maggie May\\",\\"Mandolin Wind\\") and here was an album so perfectly crafted that all these years on, you would not even want to imagine changes. Rod at the height of his abilities, with all components (and Ronnie Wood!) in place. There is no question that Rod Stewart should be recognised as one of the greatest vocalists ever recorded, if only on the basis of this one album - but what an album! Look at the front cover, it states \\"Classic Edition\\" and \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\" was, is and always will be. Buy it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I wish I had this when I went to India a few years ago to do photography. I was able to fit a Speed Graphic 4x5, Mamiya C330, and two lenses, along with a lightmeter, multiple film cans, film holders, filters, and my tripod strapped to the side, that easy.<br /><br />100% great buy.
0634060384|5.0|Great tunes make a great book - The playing of them is in your hands. Look upon it as a route map to lead you to a better place.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very Happy with purchase. The game was just as described.  Certainly made the kids very happy.  They were the one's that request it..  Thank you!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the spider game because it is a challenging. I can sat and play it for hours-if in fact I do.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because I heard raves.  The writing is SO BAD!  I gave up after 50 pages of sheer agony. E.L. James may have \\"authored\\" a book, but she is NOT a writer.  I can only try to imagine how insulted REAL writers must be that this zero talent is making money from this.  It's a travesty.
B00633W614|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this next installment of the Clifton Chronicles due to some of the less than complimentary reviews.  Poppycock to the naysayers!  This story has all the charm and intrigue as the first.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Typical 'time waster 2000&#34;.  Great for Dr.s office waiting rooms.  Takes a little time, holds your interest, easily put down when necessary.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|it makes your brain think and work to figure the puzzle out. with its different levels and different sections just keep you so content!
B00735HGQ6|4.0|This is a beautifully written book. It kept me reading, I was intrigued by the main character and thought the plot was well developed.  I found it a bit brutal at the end but then, that is life.<br />I give this a four because of the lovely descriptions.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I have converted many of my home movies for my other tablet, and when I purchased my Kindle Fire HD the built in player did not support .avi nor .wmv. To say the least I was a bit upset. After spending literally a few hours looking for a work around so I would not have to re-convert all my movies to a mp4 format. I came across MOBO Player. I installed it onto my KFHD and the videos that could not play a few hours ago, had no issues! Very pleased and hope they continue to make advances in these app as they claim they will under there \\"Help Us\\" setting.
B00005LOUP|5.0|We had the movie before and lost it in a move and are happy to own it again! Highly recommended :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but I went in after I got my high score of 200000 and it completely erased all of my progress other than that I recommend this app to everyone
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|The third wheel was one of Jeff Jenny's best diary of a wimpy kid books but I think it wasn't the best. He could have added more about Greg getting a girl or more about Rowley but otherwise it was one of his best.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app ks very adictive, and this might be the first time this week I am not on it. No prob.....
B009CPJHY4|5.0|While this film strays a great deal from the book, it is a beautiful film, very life-affirming.  The book is a bit more cynical, sad and honest.  This film touches on that sadness but develops the characters in rather more gentle and beautiful ways.  I like them both for different reasons.  Perhaps the filmmakers loved the book and took the faithfully rendered characters out to play a little, to enjoy life a little more.  Fantastic casting really makes this picture as well as the clever script and the cutting between the two story lines, one of India, the other of a fading English empire.  Wonderful, wonderful.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had heard about this book and decided to order it right away. I am very familiar with this genre of books and have my own experiences to compare on this topic as well as being very well versed in spiritual and mystical literature. After reading the book, which I have read through twice now, I must say that without any doubt it is one of the most impact filled books I have ever read. The overall and various subjects this book raises and eloquently deals with are something that everyone should and ultimately does, deal with. Everyone will undergo the dying process at some point. The opportunity exists to &#34;deal with death&#34; in a conscious and uplifting manner well ahead of the time - the moment of death (of the body, that is), and this can make the rest of ones life immeasurably more worth living if we get to the real underlying issues. This book gets to those issues and does so in a wonderful way. I find Eben Alexander's descriptions to be completely real and accurately explanatory in a way that completely resonates as the truth in my soul. This is really how we know a thing for certain and it is here that the real potential blessing of this book delivers - big time. I completely, without any reservation whatsoever, recommend this book to everyone. I have already bought 6 copies to give away as gifts. The world needs this kind of true revelatory &#34;good&#34; news and this is a very good contribution. I can not imagine a person coming away from reading this book and not being profoundly affected in a very wonderful way. Everyone's family is currently dealing with, or certainly will, deal with this subject now or in the future. And actually, the real message that this book delivers is one that should be properly and lovingly offered to children so they can live their life free of erroneous beliefs and therefore be free of needless issues that the majority of people end up having as a result of innaccurate information with which to base their beliefs on. The only issue that anyone may have with this book is whether or not to believe what is being shared. The only way a person would not believe this is if the person is not in touch with their heart. The information relayed in this book is within each of us, if we but choose to look. This book is a beacon of Divine Light that can significantly assist in this process. I unequivocally give this book my most highest recommendation.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love how realistic book was. Great plot and very current events. One of if not the best Mitch Rapp book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great read! But be warnedyou won't get much sleep due to the late nights spent reading.  Excellent writing and the story line pulls you in and keeps you in.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|... hold on!  It took me a while to get into this book, but when the story started really moving it ended far too soon.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Fantastic book!!!!<br />Took me in on the first page and didn't let me go until the last. Can't wait for the second book.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|A great movie for Austen, most especially Pride and Prejudice fans. It will keep you laughing and wanting to know more on how the story evolves. Awesome for those who are really familiar with the original story, will keep you on your toes figuring out what happens next to each character.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|What a cool way of making music putting artist together from around the world.  I first learned of playing for change when visiting Costa Rica, someone was playing the videos from You Tube.  I really enjoyed it came home and bought this cd.  There some other cd's I haven't heard but this one is really good.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|the clock is nice lookin, weather is too small, but the worst, if you pay so you can have music to fall asleep to, you lose your clock. once you go into the snooze screen you have to stay there or the music stops. so no clock. so if you want a clock to show, dont bother paying for the upgrade.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|&#34;Midnight in Paris&#34; is Owen Wilson's comeback masterpiece after a brief hiatus in his fine career.  This magical movie is a sumptious treat for anyone who hasn't been robbed of his or her imagination in this troubled world of ours. Owen's character is being dissed by his affectatious fiance, her parents, and an obnoxious pair of married friends.  Fortunately, they're all in Paris and, at 12 midnight each evening, Owen is magically taken back to the 1930s and becomes a darling of the literary giants of those days -- most of whom have more angst than our lead character.  This is a stunning movie that defies the scientific focus of today's world.  I guarantee that if you view it, you will buy this film.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|This is a great story, filming is very good. And yes, the main star, Tess is played a bit weakly. Not awful, maybe a 7 out of ten. That is shame, as everything else is so good. I would still suggest &#34;Tess&#34;, as it is a great story, well done.
B009FB3W9G|3.0|Slightly disappointed that it was so heavily edited and that only a voice over introduced each act one after the other the performances were very good especially Kristin Chenoweth & Mathew Morrison
1451608659|5.0|I found this book to be  well written and it answered a ton of questions that I had. I always thought that the Karolyi's were wonderful people, however after reading this I will never think the same thing again. You won't regret buying this book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I own at least half a dozen knife sharpeners, and this is the best I've found.  Works on kitchen tools and hunting knives.  Very pleased.  Just ordered my second one.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|Does't work as advertised. Closes after taking one pic. Doesn't show the symbols at bottom to select camera, video, etc.  Just wasted .99<br /><br />Added 12/142012 4:15pm<br />An update has been provided and the software seems to working much better. All the symbols are now showing up at the bottom so I can now use video and panoramic shots.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very unusual and hilarious. To say more would spoil it, because every sentence seems to lead to  more comic situations. First class.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I really enjoy a good hidden object game and this one is fun. It has beautiful pictures and great graphic animations! Keep up the good work and keep the awesome games coming!
B007TK77QE|4.0|This book has had bad reviews and good reviews. The former seem to relate to shock that the JK Rowling can forsake the world of mystery and magic to write about small town politics, and that there could be an autobiographical slant to the divide between a self-satisfied upper middle class local pcouncil politicians, and those on benefit who live in new housing on the periphery of this conservative idyll.<br />Those who like the book, me included, are very familiar with the basic background of the story which is repeated in different ways in small towns all over the western world. For me the situations and characterisations ring so true that she could be writing a version of my own autobiography. The story follows the intertwining lives of several incompatible characters with results both amusing and tragic.<br />There is a life after Hogwarts
B006DHASYM|4.0|I went through a few of the reviews here trying to find something about the extended edition blu-ray but they are mostly about the movie itself (I was surprised to see so many hateful reviews too since the romantic comedy genre usually has a loyal following and no one else cares much for it, or at least I thought so) I assume if you just want to watch the movie, you can read the other reviews, but if you already watched it and are thinking about buying the Blu-ray extended edition then this review is for you ;)<br /><br />I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but I gave this one a shot when it was playing on cable the other night, mainly because I really like Anna Farris, and Chris Evans is not hard to look at (and I was also surprised to see him in this kind of film... Captain America and all). As it turns out I really liked it. Its humor is right up my alley and I really had to laugh in my couch's pillows to not wake everyone up at my house when I was watching it (yes, some parts were THAT funny to me)<br /><br />I went ahead and bought the blu-ray because I knew I could watch this movie over and over, but especially I wanted to see the extended edition because there were some spots here and there where editing definitely left a void in the plot (in my opinion) so I was very interested to see more flash-backs and more comedy.<br /><br />I was dissapointed on this extra material for the most part. With the exception of a couple of good flash backs, one \\"Deep-down-Collin-is-a-sweet-guy\\" scene, the explanation of how Ally's bridesmaid dress goes from a one-shoulder fru-fru to strapless at the end of the movie, and a few other fillers that I really liked; the included extra footage in some scenes of the extended version makes Ally go from cute-clompsy girl to plain idiot (I don't think anyone would want to relate to a girl like that).<br /><br />The gag reel was extremely short for a comedy, I was expecting waaaaaay more laughs and mess-ups, but it was cute to see peoplefrom the cast and crew answering the \\"what's your number?\\" question.<br /><br />I predict I'll watch this movie whenever a rainy day comes around but I think I'll stick with the theatrical version.

B002TLSSXO|5.0|I am 63 years old and have been cooking all of my life....well almost.  These are without a doubt the very best kitchen tools I have ever had.  They feel good in the hand, the design of the working end seems perfect and they are ridged enough but not too ridged. I really like the way the keep they working end off of the counter when you set them down and they look great in the kitchen.  Once I thought I had ruined one when making spaghetti sauce.  The tomato had left a stain on one of the tools.  I cleaned it as well as I could but you could still see it a little.  The next time I used the tool, the stain was gone!  Don't ask me to explain it but I had planned to buy a new one but the problem took care of it's self.  I have had these almost a year and they still look like new.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I kept hearing people talk about the Hunger Games and had no idea what they were talking about.  A co-worker suggested I read the trilogy.  Once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down.  Once I finished I immediately started the second.  It was definitely an easy read and i'm sure i'll read again soon.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Superb acting and compelling plot.  I liked the in depth exploration of the ideas and the complex characterisation throughout the series.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I was a little hesitant to try.  Once I started the book I could not put it down.  Went right out and bought the second book when I was finished and now can't wait for the third.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Hard to put down. On a par with Hunger Games. Flows well, characters you identify with. Missed opportunities for subplot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and I'm addicted to it. I love it. I love it. And you get a challenge
B00A5052YE|3.0|Some songs sound like a Rihana knock off . Needless to say I am somewhere between dissapointed and and disillusioned.
B0013F1D02|5.0|It is a charming, whimsical movie that reminds me of The Princess Bride. Good special effects. Famous and not so famous actors.Romance, Humor. Very enjoyable.
B004XISI4A|4.0|The continuation of the masterful epic by G.R.R. Martin. Best consumed after reading the proceeding books. Get the series and read it - it works much better when you're not having to wait for the next book!
B005LAII1C|5.0|The movie Ted is a historical comedy that will become a instant classic amongst many people, the movie gives a sense of true friend bonded friendship and holding on to the love of your life but with joys and laughters. Ted is not one of those movies that the doll, toy, or stuffed animal that has poor visual effects and don't do much, the creators of Ted made him out to be people just like us. Ted fights, talk junk, has sex, drinks, party, and smokes greenery. This movie is for those whom have ups and downs with hard days of work, relationship problems ( by defining what's important!), and special holidays/ anniversities/ family reunious. The shipement from amazon sent the movie to me a day early before it was released in markets, superstores, and etc.  Even children will love this movie but must be warned! Parental descerition advised ( so please cover their eyes on certain parts and let be known that is a bad habbit, don't let them become pot heads.) A movie worth having as part of your collection of movies hands down classic comedy!
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I loved Stone of Tears. The story is gripping and full of interesting twists and turns. Magic and swords... magic swords... and war. Let's not forget the war. Read it!
6304493681|5.0|In 2029, the barriers in our world have been dissolved by the internet and cybernetics. Humans have also gained the power of \\"brain hacking\\". A wanted hacker called \\"The Puppetmaster\\", has involved them in politics. Section 9 has been charged with investigating him. The cybernetically enhanced cops are chasing a ghost it seems. They learn that the lines between man and machine are becoming increasingly blurred. The morality of killing a cybernetically enhanced human is questioned when the existence of a soul is not a certainty.<br /><br />This is a cinematic legend. Even though it's plot seems unrealistic, the moral dilemmas presented are timeless. The animation, soundtrack, voice acting and story line are all excellent. This movie is incredibly heavy. It is loaded with action, drama, and suspense. It's one of the most famous animated films for a good reason.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love the game and the whole mystery theme! could use a bit more instruction though. hard to know how to use the tools.

1400032717|4.0|Very accurate representation of Autism and how autistic children would likely think.  Has a somewhat interesting story as well, though not particularly involved.  Little character development, but then it's coming from the perspective of an autistic child so it would ruin the narrator's development to allow the reader to connect with any other characters.
B00406UK7S|5.0|I bought this movie because I had already seen it and already loved it. I am completely satisfied with the service I received.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Get this game &#34;free&#34;, but then you have to pay in-app to get the actual games themselves.  Completely false advertising.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|you get all 5 discs in one case. best room saver ever. plus the film it self is good.the extra are good too
0756404738|5.0|This book continues the absolutely amazing writing demonstrated in The Name of the Wind.  I've always said there are authors that can write to describe something so you understand it, then there are those who's diction makes you feel the scene instead.  This book is definitely the later.  A story that engages the reader in what seems to be a realistic and pragmatic world, it simultaneously develops the story you care the most about, the origin, while throwing in interesting but not overwhelming story from what's occurring around the narrator in the present.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great work and easy reading.<br />This book has shown me that a person can be many things but Love can change any hang ups we may have. An open mind and heart is a filler Life
0553801473|5.0|While the entire series has been great, the 4th book was a little disappointing.  No one cares about Sam, or ever will, so constantly talking about his depressing existence without at least breaking it up with some action was an unfortunate choice.  This book however takes advantage of the slightly boring development that occurred in book 4, and covers all the interesting characters that were effectively left out of the last book.  It occurs concurrently with book 4 and the tie-ins help character and story development immensely.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love anything Susan Boyle sings.  I have all of her CD's and this one may be my favorite.  It is wonderful!
B00A50PE6K|5.0|All I can say is any album with a song from Darren Criss has to be outstanding. What a great version of White Christmas. Glee brings their own fun spin to the holidays. A must have for any Glee fan or lover of Christmas music!

B000056HOZ|4.0|I enjoyed this Video anthology of  &#34;the Boss&#34;. It had a lot of my favorite songs and a few new ones I had not heard before. (They actually were not new songs, but I hadn't heard them before). There was a repeat of one or two songs. But one of the repeats of Born In The USA was an acoustic version and I think I preferred that version to the original one that was released.Over all I was pleased with my purchase!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is good it gives you a good seen for every part you read in this book. But it would help if we knew what they looked like. It tells you all about love and sex but I love Those romantic books. Grey needs to do something other than having sex with a Ana and I know he changes a little and that's a good thing :) it still need to have fun stuff by that girlfriends and boyfriends do when they are together but over all its an awesome amazing love and romantic story good job
0525478817|5.0|I've enjoyed several of Green's books, but he has outdone himself with this one. It goes beyond the expectation of the young adult genre, and is simply a great book about life.
B003XE1CU2|5.0|I have these in black and absolutely loved them, so I ordered a white pair. I am a nurse and on my feet they are very comfortable.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|Holy crap this EP is good.  Been a while since I listened to Down but I liked the idea of what they were planning with the 4 EP release idea so as soon as I saw the first one I grabbed it up.  I wasn't even thru the first listen of track 1 when I knew it was a going to be a great dose of metal.<br /><br />4 reasons to go BUY it now:<br /><br />1. The cover art is brooding and cool. The mood of the tunes and the art work sync perfectly.  For those of us that still buy an actual disk or record, that's important to us, since we tend to hold it and stare at it while we drink our beer and crank it up.  Then sometimes we buy a T-shirt with the cover art on it to wear while we drink and stare at the cover art and crank it up.  Cover art = important to metal heads.  They did good on this one.  Dare I say it's as cool as the first Black Sabbath cover?  Maybe I do.<br /><br />2. There's a song on here entitled \\"Witchtripper\\".  How cool is that?  That's reason enough to check it out.  I don't pretend to know what the word means and really don't care to have it explained to me - but I think it's my new favorite word and now I feel like I could trip witches all day and never get tired of it at this point.<br /><br />3. 33 minutes of pounding, grooving, brooding, brutal metal.  i enjoy a short set because i can listen to the whole thing on the way to work or back.  I mean I could have 23 hours and 27 minutes of a crap day, pop this in and fix the whole day right there.  Friends that's what I call efficiency. Not that I don't enjoy a 73 minute metal opus as much as the next dedicated introspective listener but I think we can all agree the sometimes we'd prefer a quick fix - kinda get to the point and get on with things.  This does that brilliantly for me.<br /><br />4. all 6 tracks are great.  These guys are really tapped into their collective talent.  They sound tight, but still make it come off like a it's a great jam session. The drums and bass really lay down a signature foundation - so much of the groove or vibe starts right there. I hack at guitar myself so I really pay attention to that and these two guys are killer - and now I'm a bit upset with myself for not reading up on them before.  I hope I can find a write up in one of the many guitar publications out there and if we're lucky we'll get \\"Witchtripper\\" tabbed out.  Phil's vocals are crushing - it's Phil doing what he does and doing it great.  I think he's a great talent and a real ambassador for metal.<br /><br />Hard not to sound cliche when you're talking about bands and the individual members who have been at it this long but here's an example of the phrase \\"instant classic\\".
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I've used it a few times and it works on my kindle fire hd good. I like how the numbers are large so there easy to see.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I couldn't ever really put this book down after I got into it. It definitely ended different than I had anticipated. A must read for a final book of three :)
B009AXXI52|5.0|Originally released in a long boxed set, this collection now comes in a 4CD jewel case. This may have compromised the presentation a little, but it made the set much more affordable. I bought the jewel case version, which contains a booklet that runs to around 72 pages, but without page numbers (so I could have counted wrongly). This is not a hits collection although plenty of hits are featured. Because of that, the booklet does not included an overview of the Bee Gees' biography and career, but it does have plenty of pictures and tributes from family members and others. I was particularly interested in the comments from some of the singers who worked with one or more of the Bee Gees. I found Kenny Rogers' comments about the recording of Islands in the stream particularly amusing. (Buy or borrow the set to read them.)<br /><br />I already owned several compilations of Bee Gees music when I bought this, so I already had some of the tracks on the first two CD's, but not as many as I expected. I never bought any of Andy's music but I'm pleased to find it here. However, I bought this compilation because I like the idea of each brother having one CD featuring songs with their voices prominent. Their voices are not all that different from each other, so it's not always easy to distinguish them. This set makes the differences clearer.<br /><br />The tracks were chosen by Barry and Robin, both still alive at the time the original set was compiled, and relatives of the other two brothers. (By the time I wrote this review, only Barry was still alive.) Personally, I liked all aspects of the Bee Gees' music, although I always hoped to hear more of their late sixties folk-pop music eventually. I was therefore pleased to find a good sprinkling of non-hits from the era featured here.<br /><br />I do not know exactly how the family made their choices, but the CD's for Barry and Robin feature plenty of Bee Gees hits and some versions of songs they wrote that were hits for others (Heartbreaker, Love me, If I can't have you, More than a woman, Islands in the stream) as well as some comparative obscurities. One famous song not featured is Nights on Broadway, which was a Bee Gees hit in America, but a UK hit for Candi Staton. From the sixties, a notable omission is World. These are not the only omissions, as you'll find if you look at a list of their hits.<br /><br />There are other songs that the Bee Gees wrote that other artists recorded and with which I am familiar, not all of which were recorded by the Bee Gees. The one omission that I am most familiar with that they definitely recorded was recorded by Olivia Newton-John and became the title track to her album [[ASIN:B000002PBS Come on Over]] during her country music phase. Olivia appears in this box via a duet with Andy on his CD. She is also one of the singers whose tribute is featured in the booklet.<br /><br />Maurice's CD features no big hits. As I used to own [[ASIN:B000006SUJ E.S.P.]] on vinyl, I must have heard Overnight, but I don't remember it (I got rid of most of my vinyl collection in 1993), nor do I recognize any of the other tracks on his CD. The CD for Andy features his big hits, which is inevitable as this is the first time that he has featured on a Bee Gees compilation.<br /><br />If you`re only interested in hits, you'll likely think that this collection contains far too much filler. If, like me, you want to explore the album tracks without necessarily buying a lot of their original albums, this will suit you ideally.artbreaker, Love me, If I can't have you, More than a woman, Islands in the stream) as well as some comparative obscurities.

B0041KVW2K|4.0|I am extremely pleased with the great sound of this set.  I have listened to all of the albums and am impressed with the warmer ambiance of the recordings.  The lower end is a lot more prominent than the MFSL set pressed in the 80's and it is a compliment to own both collections since each set has their own significant high points.  The reason I give this set 4 stars is because some of the records are not perfectly flat although this did not interfere with playback.  Overall, I recommend this set to anyone who loves to hear music via the warmth of vinyl media and who most especially enjoys the music of the Beatles.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I thought it was very confusing at the beginning. Very slow start to get to the plot of the true story
B005SV9X22|5.0|I was so excited to see this on DVD. I don't have HBO so I was watching the bootleg version on you tube.  I attended her concert in my hometown but I was on the floor, right by the railing - which is amazing. Sadly, there was also a lot I missed not having the advantage of seeing the whole stage. Now, I get to watch it at home and relive the memories of being at The Monster Ball myself.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Um...this is Dickens....A Christmas Carol...Beautifully illustrative...and free right around the holidays!<br />How could this not get anything but 5 stars?
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Love this!  A reviewer said how great the picture quality is and how you can see every blade of grass.  He was right!!  It seemed as though I had never seen TSOM before in my life.  I'm even watching the version with Julie Andrews talking about the film.  Lot's of bonus features too.<br /><br />And as a side note, the video did make me mourn for the damage done to Julie Andrews' beautiful voice.  Even when she is speaking about certain scenes or people you can hear the raspy quality. Such a loss.
B0086700CM|4.0|The kids really enjoy playing Temple Run.  For me, it's a great way to pass the time during the day.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I liked their first album &#34;Sigh no more&#34; a great deal, so naturally I wanted to hear what they put together for &#34;Babel&#34;.  It did not disappoint.  &#34;Lover of the light&#34; and &#34;I will wait&#34; were probably my favorite songs from the album.  Their mix of banjo and mandolin is delightful every time I listen to it.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|I buy one Holiday Album every year and I've been patiently waiting for James Taylor's year... and I am not disappointed.  He is fantastic on this album.  Everything that makes James Taylor a unique and engaging artist is held true as he sings through a traditional AND ecclectic collection of carols.  I have forever been completely taken in by James Taylor's bashful folk collections and this album was such a tremendous treat.  Just love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me reading.  I couldn't put it down.  Loved it!!  My husband is not a big reader, but he's reading the series now.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|this game downloaded and functioned fine on my kindle. it is a cute side scroller game and it has the possibility to be really fun - but unlike the original Mario on nes this did not work for me - I really hate not being able to control the jumping - it makes it too darn difficult and lowers the fun factor for me because squashing your enemies is a pain of timing - it can be done but becomes really tedious. overall I like this type of game and I really wanted to like this one as the description sounded cute and fun - my kids don't have the patience for this one although I bet they try a few times.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this psychological thriller. The character development was excellent and the story kept you wanting more with every chapter. Well done

0061537969|5.0|This book is a fantasy.  Get used to it.  Dogs don't think like this--they come up short on analytical thinking.<br /><br />Nevertheless, dogs understand a lot.  That takes some getting used to.  They understand human speech a lot too.  This book challenged me to try harder to understand what my dogs pick up on, to notice the patterns in what they understand and what gets past them, and to communicate better with them.<br /><br />No, I do not tell my dogs to bark twice if they want me to drive faster or once if they want me to slow down.  (smile)<br /><br />There is one idea Mr. Stein offered in this book that, I think, should perhaps be taken seriously.  In the novel, Enzo determines by scent that Eve, one of his co-owners, has an illness that she is not aware of.  My sense, based on my knowledge of dogs' incredible sense of smell, is that this is feasible.  Might dogs be trained to alert on unique scents given off by people who have particular illnesses?  Might they be brought into medical practices primarily as therapy dogs with an alternative role of alerting when they pick up the scent of a chronic illness?<br /><br />Just a thought.<br /><br />Nonetheless, engaging in this fantasy (i.e., reading the book) was a lot of fun.  Many thanks to Garth Stein.

B000FC12Z0|5.0|I'm combining this review of the book and movie together because the stories are so closely related, and I think that anyone who likes the movie will be interested to know about the book, and readers who have enjoyed the book may like to get some details about the movie. The 1974 movie is a true classic, and along with many others I look forward to the time when it will be digitally restored and issued on blu-ray disk.<br /><br />I love the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express movie and have watched it several times over the years on TV and DVD. I've only recently read the book for the first time on Kindle, and was frankly quite amazed to see how faithful the movie was to Christie's novel of the same title written in 1934. Since most of the story takes place on a train, it was relatively easy for producers to keep the movie closely aligned to the book even in many small details, and I'm grateful that they did. After reading the book and seeing how Christie portrayed Poirot as being a more quiet and low key personality, I can appreciate that some criticize the selection and performance of Albert Finney as Poirot because he is often quite emotional and demonstrative, as well as physically different than the Poirot Christie described. This is the only major difference between the 1974 movie and the book, though it can be a crucial difference for Christie fans.<br /><br />Christie's story is loosely based on the actual kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's 20-month-old son in 1932. A $50,000 ransom was paid but the baby was murdered and his body was found two months later.

B005IQ39AY|3.0|The controls are a little laggy - have to swipe a few times to get the ball to fire.  On the original kindle fire, If you go really slow, it is more reliable.  Kind of interesting from a strategy perspective - not about popping, but more about dropping.  Isn't clear how the scoring works though. The global rankings at the end of the game is dumb (the network access permissions the game requires).
0385333846|5.0|When there are only 4 choices of classics to read for a whole sophomore class - the library can't exactly keep up. Amazon was our best bet on getting the book we needed quickly and at a great price! It is a great classic to read too.

B00AHSIQWE|1.0|This was incredibly disappointing! Who wants to watch a superhero movie where most of the dialogue is about why he SHOULDN'T be a superhero??? Like being a superhero is some awful, depressing and never worth it? Really?!??? Since when is fighting evil a bad thing???? Even Christian Bale seems depressed and forced through the whole thing.<br /><br />Best part? the villain! While I could guess nearly every line in the movie (BAD writing to say the least), the mask had the only good lines in the entire thing.<br /><br />Angst ridden, three hours of wandering that make you think Batman coming back is a immoral decision and under-utilizing the huge potential of catwoman, and you have yourself a bunch of hollywood drivel. Not only that, but the plot is so reminiscent of the second Batman that it just makes you scratch your head. What I'd like to know is why they spent the first two hours on a single week in time, and the last half hour trying to demonstrate six months... and injuries that are flat out unbelievable (right, a broken back can be fixed by hitting it), that the whole thing is just miserable. They were miserable making it and it shows... except for the villain. You don't want him to die. But all the plot twists? We figured them out in the first 20 mins.<br /><br />Don't bother... the hype is just desperate marketing.
B005L18C4E|2.0|What follows is a fascinating and to my mind compelling review by Jim Hinch in the Los Angeles Review of Books December 1 2012[...]  As soon as I started reading commentary on this work I became suspicious of Greenblatt's history.  Even an informed amateur as I am, is aware that the older version of the \\"Dark Ages\\" (mis)used by Greenblatt is way out of date.  To be clear I am an atheist and admirer of the renaissance - if I can so simplify things.  I do think that we who argue against the theologists in our midst, need to do so clearly and carefully acknowledging the complexities that historiography always challenges us with.    Los Angeles Review of Books  Jim Hinch on The Swerve by Stephen Greenblatt    Why Stephen Greenblatt is Wrong -- and Why It Matters  December 1st, 2012    ONE YEAR AGO THIS MONTH, Harvard Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt stepped to the podium at the Cipriani Club in New York City to accept the National Book Award for nonfiction. Greenblatt won for The Swerve: How the World Became Modern, a 356-page study of the transformative cultural power wielded by an ancient Latin poem called De Rerum Natura by a first-century BC Epicurean philosopher named Titus Lucretius Caro. Holding back tears, Greenblatt thanked, among other people, his publishers at W.W. Norton for committing to \\"the insane idea that they could sell a book about the discovery of an ancient poem by a Renaissance humanist to more than a handful of people.\\" In fact, by the time Greenblatt addressed the Cipriani Club's gold-domed ballroom, The Swerve already had spent more than a month on the New York Times bestseller list, just as had Greenblatt's previous book, Will in the World, a Shakespeare biography that came close to winning its own National Book Award (it was a finalist). Five months later, The Swerve won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. The book remains a strong seller on Amazon.    Clearly, The Swerve spoke to far more than a handful of people. But as Americanbook lovers gear up for another awards season -- the National Book Award this month, followed by the PEN/Faulkner Award in March, then the Pulitzers in April -- the acclaim showered on Greenblatt's book about the discovery of an ancient poem raises profound questions about just what these awards really mean. Simply put, The Swerve did not deserve the awards it received because it is filled with factual inaccuracies and founded upon a view of history not shared by serious scholars of the periods Greenblatt studies. That such a book could win two of America's highest literary honors suggests something doesn't work in the awards system itself.    The Swerve, in fact, is two books, one deserving of an award, the other not. The first book is an engaging literary detective story about an intrepid Florentine bibliophile named Poggio Braccionlini, who, in 1417, stumbled upon a 500-year-old copy of De Rerum Natura in a German monastery and set the poem free from centuries of neglect to work its intellectual magic on the world. This Swerve, brimming with vivid evocations of Renaissance papal court machinations and a fascinating exploration of Lucretius's influence on luminaries ranging from Leonardo Da Vinci, to Galileo, to Thomas Jefferson, is wonderful.    The second Swerve is an anti-religious polemic. According to this book, the lucky fate of De Rerum Natura is a proxy for the much more consequential story of how modern western secular culture liberated itself from the deadening hand of centuries of medieval religious dogmatism. \\"Many of [De Rerum Natura's] core arguments are among the foundations on which modern life has been constructed,\\" Greenblatt writes in The Swerve. \\"Almost every one of the work's key principles was an abomination to right-thinking Christian orthodoxy.\\" In other words, The World Became Modern when it learned to stop believing in God and start believing in itself. Here's how Greenblatt describes the epic transformation Lucretius helped bring about:Something happened in the Renaissance, something that surged up against the constraints that centuries had constructed around curiosity, desire, individuality, sustained attention to the material world, the claims of the body. [...] The transformation was not sudden or once-for-all, but it became increasingly possible to turn away from a preoccupation with angels and demons and immaterial causes and to focus instead on things in this world; to understand that humans are made of the same stuff as everything else and are part of the natural order; to conduct experiments without fearing that one is infringing on God's jealously guarded secrets; to question authorities and challenge received doctrines; to legitimate the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain; to imagine that there are other worlds beside the one that we inhabit; to entertain the thought that the sun is only one star in an infinite universe; to live an ethical life without reference to postmortem rewards and punishments; to contemplate without trembling the death of the soul. In short, it became possible -- never easy, but possible -- in the poet Auden's phrase to find the mortal world enough.    Lucretius's role in this cultural revolution was to inject, with a flavoring of poetic wonder, the idea that God and religious faith not only are unnecessary for personal fulfillment but in fact are incompatible with human happiness and the pursuit of truth. Among the influential themes Greenblatt finds in De Rerum Natura: there is no God, no gods, no creator of the universe; all religions are invariably cruel; the highest goal of human life is the enhancement of pleasure and the reduction of pain; the chief enemy of pleasure is not pain but delusion.    Prior to the revival of such insights, according to The Swerve, western Europe endured a long, suffocating era dominated by an obscurantist, pleasure-hating religious ideology. Greenblatt's characterization of the Middle Ages, scattered throughout TheSwerve, is summed up in an article he wrote for The New Yorker shortly before the book was published. The article synthesizes various passages from The Swerve:    It is possible for a whole culture to turn away from reading and writing. As the Roman Empire crumbled and Christianity became ascendant, as cities decayed, trade declined, and an anxious populace scanned the horizon for barbarian armies, the ancient system of education fell apart. What began as downsizing went on to wholesale abandonment. Schools closed, libraries and academies shut their doors, professional grammarians and teachers of rhetoric found themselves out of work, scribes were no longer given manuscripts to copy. There were more important things to worry about than the fate of books. Lucretius's poem, so incompatible with any cult of the gods, was attacked, ridiculed, burned, or ignored, and, like Lucretius himself, eventually forgotten.    The idea of pleasure and beauty that the work advanced was forgotten with it. Theology provided an explanation for the chaos of the Dark Ages: human beings were by nature corrupt. Inheritors of the sin of Adam and Eve, they richly deserved every miserable catastrophe that befell them. God cared about human beings, just as a father cared about his wayward children, and the sign of that care was anger. It was only through pain and punishment that a small number could find the narrow gate to salvation. A hatred of pleasure-seeking, a vision of God's providential rage, and an obsession with the afterlife: these were death knells of everything Lucretius represented.    This is a powerful vision of the world entering a prolonged period of cultural darkness. If it were true, then Greenblatt's second Swerve, the anti-religious polemic, also would deserve every award and plaudit it won. However, Greenblatt's vision is not true, not even remotely. As even a general reader can gather from a text as basic as Cambridge University historian George Holmes' Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe (published in 1988 and still available on Amazon): \\"Western civilization was created in medieval Europe. The forms of thought and action which we take for granted in modern Europe and America, which we have exported to other substantial portions of the globe, and from which indeed we cannot escape, were implanted in the mentalities of our ancestors in the struggles of the medieval centuries.\\" Greenblatt's caricatured Middle Ages might have passed muster with Enlightenment-era historians. Present-day scholarship, especially the findings of archeologists and specialists in church and social history, tells a vastly more complicated, interesting and indeterminate story.    I'm at a loss to explain how two distinguished prize juries managed to overlook the fact that The Swerve's animating thesis is at best \\"questionable,\\" and at worst \\"unwarranted,\\" as Renaissance historian John Monfasani put it this summer in the online journal Reviews in History. Still, to make clear the extent of The Swerve's errors, I'll go through Greenblatt's portrait of the Middle Ages point by point. First, it may be true that \\"it is possible for a whole culture to turn away from reading and writing.\\" But that didn't happen in medieval Europe. Indeed the Middle Ages are considered Europe's most bookish era, a time when books -- Christian, Greek and Roman alike -- were accorded near totemic authority. Medieval readers and writers (not just clergy -- lay culture was widely influenced by texts and documents, especially following the 10th century) were apt to believe anything they read in an old book just because it was old and from a book. This was especially true if the book happened to be by a writer like Lucretius, a classical author whose words therefore automatically carried the imprimatur of truth.    There are declines in written evidence during the centuries immediately following the wane of Rome but that's not because medieval people suddenly became illiterateor bullied by Church culture police. Rather, during those centuries Europe was a primary destination for waves of migration from the interior of Asia and regions east of the Baltic Sea. Most of these migratory peoples preserved their cultural memories orally and so they did not pay attention to books while plundering medieval monasteries, where most libraries were located. Nevertheless it did not take long for these peoples to assimilate to written culture. Anglo-Saxon England, colonized from the sixth century primarily by waves of illiterate Germanic tribes was within decades considered Europe's finest center of book production, home to such gorgeous volumes as the Lindisfarne Gospels.    Along these lines it is simply untrue to assert that classical culture was ever lost, ignored or suppressed during the Middle Ages. As Garry Wills noted last month in The New York Review of Books (reviewing the latest publication by Augustine biographer Peter Brown): it is a \\"discredited [...] myth [...] that the Roman Empire (but only in the West) `fell' overnight when barbarians invaded and brought it down. The light of classical times blinked out and we stumbled straightway into the Dark Ages.\\" Writers throughout the medieval period read, copied and were profoundly influenced by texts such as Virgil's Aeneid and Ovid's Metamorphoses. The earliest manuscript of the Metamorphoses dates from the ninth century, as do the two earliest copies of De Rerum Natura. In fact, as Cambridge classicist Michael Reeve pointed out five years ago in The Cambridge Companion to Lucretius, scholars have long detected \\"Lucretian influence in north-Italian writers of the ninth to eleventh century, in the Paduan pre-humanists about 1300, in Dante, and in Petrarch and Bocaccio.\\" Greenblatt cites the Cambridge Companion numerous times in his endnotes. Did he read it?    Greek learning was similarly influential during the Middle Ages. Greek texts, brought by Muslim and Jewish scholars who had rediscovered thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle in libraries in Mesopotamia, began filtering into Europe almost immediately following eighth-century Muslim conquests in Spain and Asia Minor. By the 12th century, Aristotle was widely known to European scholars, and major theologians such as Thomas Aquinas spent the 13th century attempting to form a grand synthesis of Aristotelian and Christian thought. Chaucer, at the end of his poem Troilus and Criseyde, written in the late 1300s, sends his poem off to seek its fortune at the feet of \\"Virgil, Ovid, Homer, Lucan and Statius.\\" Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a weird and wonderful poem written probably by a late-14th-century clergyman for the entertainment of a rural gentry household in the northwest of England, begins with an account of the fall of Troy.    Equally untrue is Greenblatt's claim that medieval culture was characterized by \\"a hatred of pleasure-seeking, a vision of God's providential rage and an obsession with the afterlife.\\" I know Greenblatt has read Chaucer. He's quoted from him in numerous books. Has he forgotten the ribald pleasure-seeking in The Canterbury Tales? What about the 13th-century French courtly love epic The Romance of the Rose? The twelfth-century Arthurian romances of Chrétien de Troyes? I find no rage in Dante's complex vision of human morality and providential grace in the Divine Comedy. Nor do I detect an ounce of asceticism in the ravishing unicorn tapestries in the Cloisters Museum in New York. Or in the rose window in Chartres. Or in the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. Or in the gracious courts of the Alhambra.    Similarly, it is a gross distortion to describe medieval people as \\"an anxious populace\\" scanning \\"the horizon for barbarian armies.\\" By \\"barbarian\\" Greenblatt presumably means the Goths, Vikings and other non-western-European peoples who migrated out of Asia and the Baltic regions beginning in the first century. Scholars of Late Antiquity know that this process of migration was primarily characterized by gradual colonization and assimilation, not decisive battles fought by bloodthirsty hordes. (The battles get more prominent mention in written sources but archeology tells a different story.) One of those hordes, otherwise known as the Normans (or \\"North-Men\\"), migrated from Scandinavia first to northern France, then to England, and finally to Sicily, where beginning in the 11th century they founded a kingdom that went on to become one of Europe's most cosmopolitan centers. Medieval Sicily was a thriving melting pot of Muslims, Jews and Christians. Along with Spain, Constantinople and the cities of northern Italy, it formed one of the main conduits to medieval Europe for the riches of Islamic civilization, riches that include many of the scientific and cultural advancements Greenblatt erroneously traces to early modern Europe. Perhaps Greenblatt could have written about this Sicilian Swerve. But then of course he'd have had to open up his account of the Middle Ages to a far more complex story of multiple swerves, connections and continuities. He'd have had to find a new name for his book. He'd have had to write a different book altogether.    The Swerve, however, is what we got. And nothing in its depiction of the Middle Ages is as tellingly wrong as its bizarre excursus into the practice of medieval monastic self-flagellation. About a third of the way through The Swerve Greenblatt suddenly begins quoting various passages, mostly from medieval saint's lives (notoriously unreliable as historical evidence), that describe the kind of self-scourging familiar to viewers of medieval film noir -- Hollywood blockbusters such as \\"The Name of the Rose\\" or \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" These lurid accounts culminate in the claim that \\"a vast body of evidence confirms that such theaters of pain [...] were widespread in the Middle Ages.\\" A check of the endnotes shows that Greenblatt cites no such \\"vast body of evidence\\" and of course he doesn't. There is no evidencebecause self-flagellation was not widespread in the Middle Ages. Not in homes, not in churches, not even in monasteries. In fact medieval monasteries were among the least religious and most worldly institutions of their time. Like modern research universities, medieval monasteries were wealthy centers of learning and power whose leaders rotated into and out of careers in secular government. Waves of monastic reform efforts testify to a perennial complaint in the Middle Ages that religious authorities, far from enforcing an ascetic, pleasure-hating discipline, in fact were too luxurious, too cozy with the rich, too willing to dispense with their religious vows.    I mention the self-flagellants because -- in a touch worthy of Greenblatt himself -- this particular tic in The Swerve turns out to be key to unlocking both the book's underlying worldview and the reason that worldview won such praise. Here is Greenblatt on the whippers:    The ordinary self-protective, pleasure-seeking impulses of the lay public could not hold out against the passionate convictions and overwhelming prestige of their spiritual leaders. Beliefs and practices that had been the preserve of religious specialists, men and women set apart from the vulgar, everyday imperatives of the \\"world,\\" found their way into the mainstream, where they thrived in societies of flagellants and periodic bursts of mass hysteria. What was once in effect a radical counterculture insisted with remarkable success that it represented the core values of all believing Christians.    Greenblatt, as I mentioned, does not cite any primary sources attesting to widespread medieval self-flagellation, so I don't know where he got this idea. What I'm more interested in is the notion that such asceticism represented \\"the core values of all believing Christians\\" in the Middle Ages. In fact no serious scholar would claim to know what \\"the core values of all believing Christians\\" were, in the Middle Ages or in any other period, because historical sources never yield enough unambiguous information to make such overstated claims. And yet it is here, where his evidence is weakest, that Greenblatt lays most stress in his argument. And of course he does, because The Swerve is a story about transformation and triumph. And without a caricatured Middle Ages of self-hating religious dogmatists Greenblatt has no clean-cut transformation and no clean-cut triumph. The complex truth about medieval Europe, indeed about all historical periods -- that pleasure and pain, love and hate, faith and doubt, curiosity and stupidity, superstition and rationality, existed everywhere and at all times in complex and varying measure -- is not so easily packaged as a narrative and so is less likely to top bestseller lists. But that doesn't absolve Greenblatt of responsibility for getting his facts right. Unless, of course, that wasn't his goal.    It wasn't. If Greenblatt remained one of the \\"tenured radicals\\" he once was accused of being (by no less a scold than George Will), The Swerve might have told readers that notions such as the Middle Ages and the Renaissance are little better than shorthand for arbitrarily bracketed periods of time in which certain changes in the pattern of human life are interpreted as significant and others are not. It might have enumerated the costs of so-called modernity, and the continuities from the past that sustain it, alongside the justifiably celebrated developments. It might have noted that many of the supposed religious values scorned by Lucretius -- faith, self-sacrifice, an identity shaped not by individual desire but by family and community -- remain widespread in western and non-western cultures and are in no way inimical to human freedom and progress. A truly radical book might have left readers feeling more challenged by the past, less quick to pass judgment and more able to find value in ways of life alien to their own.    Instead, The Swerve's primary achievement is to flatter like-minded readers with a tall tale of enlightened modern values triumphing over a benighted pre-modern past. It's no accident, I think, that The Swerve's imagined Middle Ages bears a strong resemblance to America's present era of superstitious know-nothing-ism. Or that Lucretius's secular, principled-pleasure-minded values bear an equally strong resemblance to the values of Greenblatt's cultural peers -- including, presumably, the jurors who awarded him two national literary prizes. The Swerve presents itself as a work of literary history. But really it is a salvo in the culture wars; an effort to lend an aura of historical inevitability to the idea that religious faith has no place in a modern democratic society.    Writing shortly after The Swerve was published, The Washington Post's Michael Dirda panned Greenblatt's book as a shallow, derivative \\"non-fiction potboiler.\\" Dirda wrote that he couldn't put his finger on why exactly The Swerve \\"rubbed me wrong.\\" I can think of a reason. Unlike other non-fiction potboilers, The Swerve claimed for itself, and received, huge moral and cultural authority it simply didn't earn. Armed with that authority, the book went on to fool unsuspecting readers (like a reviewer for The Philadelphia Inquirer, who called The Swerve \\"a chapter in how we became what we are\\") into believing that Lucretius, who wrote of placidly watching others suffer secure in the knowledge that all phenomena in the universe are merely a wondrous rearrangement of atoms, somehow symbolizes all that is bright and new in the origin of modern life. (This latter point is developed at length in Morgan Meis's review of The Swerve in the journal n+1.) Greenblatt obviously admires Lucretius. And, as he wrote in a brief rebuttal to John Monfasani in Reviews in History, \\"I am of the devil's party that believes that something significant happened in the Renaissance.\\" That's marvelous. But it doesn't give Greenblatt the right to make stuff up. I would like to thinkthat when America's literary lions gather to award their best and brightest they are looking for robust factual engagement with the messy complexities of human life, not just intellectual self-congratulation. The honors heaped on The Swerve make me wonder.    I once had a teacher at Berkeley named Robert Brentano, a historian of medieval Europe whose mind crackled with all the restlessness and complexity The Swerve lacks. In an afterword to his most famous book, Two Churches, a study of English and Italian churchmen in the 13th century, Brentano wrote of his desire to dispense with narrative in history altogether. The best historical writing, he wrote, can present \\"a series of images and ideas whole, clear, bright, and let the transition occur, as it should, without the dullness of written words. Without words, transition becomes beautiful. If I ever have enough nerve, I shall write history completely without transition.\\"    This awards season I'm rooting for ideas whole, clear and bright. Writing with the nerve to say what's true. History without transition\\"

145162607X|5.0|*Review From Impressions In Ink Blog*<br />Summary:<br />Anne Neville was born 11 June 1456 and died 16 March 1485.<br />Her father was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, also known as the Kingmaker. Her mother was Anne de Beauchamp. She had one older sibling, Isabel. The Earl of Warwick was a very wealthy nobleman, he owned land and houses. He was a powerful man that exuded both ambition and arrogance. He wanted to be in power. If he could not control the king, he would control the country through his offspring. He was willing to sacrifice all for the sake of his goal. His daughter's Isabel and Anne as young girls were pawns in their father's hands. They obeyed because they had no other choice. They idolized their father, but they were at odds with him. He was a larger than life person. A man that history has not forgotten. As Isabel and Anne grew, they too had ambitions. As females their ambitions were smote against the men they married. Anne wanted to please her father, even after he was gone. For Isabel and Anne their life mission was to give birth to healthy son's. Three York brother's: Edward, George, and Richard, each had ambitions to be King of England. Their ambitions may have taken the form of wanting what was safest for the monarchy and the country. But, they all had varying degrees of craftiness in how to carry out their plan. The women they married held a key part of their plan in having an heir (son) that would adhere their lineage to the throne. The \\"best\\" man does not always win, as in a game of chess the person with the best tactic wins. In the later part of The Kingmaker's Daughter we are given a brief introduction to a another ambitious man who is waiting for his moment, a man named Henry Tudor.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />  When the book begins Anne (who is our voice throughout the story) is a young girl. The author does a splendid job in portraying a believable young character. Anne is not confident, she wants to please her mother and father, she feels hidden and unseen behind her older sister.<br />  There is never a dull moment in the book, each pages events drew me in with their strength.<br />  I've stated this before in other reviews. Women of previous ages had no voice, and certainly no choice in their life. If they had beauty, or sex appeal, or charm, or intelligence, or wit---these could be used to their advantage; but this was a man's world, and men dominated women. The Kingmaker's Daughter brought this issue out through the story. We see not only in Anne and Isabel, but their mother, mother in-law's, and other women who may have appeared to be dominant; but their fate was sealed by the men who ruled them.<br />  One of the authors motives was to look at those in history whom we've been taught to have been the enemy, and instead she showed them as a possible hero. I'll add a possible \\"believable\\" hero. Knowing what I know about Richard the III, this was a difficult challenge. I'm not sure the author convinced me, but certainly made me pause to consider this alternative.<br /><br />Negative Points:<br /><br />  The romance element is not of deep abiding love. Because not at any point did I believe the men loved their women with their entire heart. Their heart belonged to the throne of England, secondly to the people of Britain, then to their children, lastly to their wives. I'm not sure this is necessarily a negative comment on the story, as it was the reality of these characters. I do believe readers should understand this is not and should not be thought of as a book geared as romantic love. The Kingmaker's Daughter is historical fiction with the focus on the Neville, Lancaster and York families.<br />I purchased this hardcover. I chose to read/review.er, she feels hidden and unseen behind her older sister.<br />  There is never a dull moment in the book, each pages events drew me in with their strength.<br />  I've stated this before in other reviews. Women of previous ages had no voice, and certainly no choice in their life. If they had beauty, or sex appeal, or charm, or intelligence, or wit---these could be used to their advantage; but this was a man's world, and men dominated women. The Kingmaker's Daughter brought this issue out through the story. We see not only in Anne and Isabel, but their mother, mother in-law's, and other women who may have appeared to be dominant; but their fate was sealed by the men who ruled them.<br />  One of the authors motives was to look at those in history whom we've been taught to have been the enemy, and instead she showed them as a possible hero. I'll add a possible \\"believable\\" hero. Knowing what I know about Richard the III, this was a difficult challenge. I'm not sure the author convinced me, but certainly made me pause to consider this alternative.<br /><br />Negative Points:<br /><br />  The romance element is not of deep abiding love.

B0011Z52EW|4.0|I heard the brothers talk about the album in an interview with Kevin Smith, and bought it straight away.<br />Was never my type of music, but these guys are real musicians with a flare for story. If you like anthems, and collections like Quadraphenia or The Wall you should check it out.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Movie is great, 5 star worthy and a fitting conclusion to the Nolan trilogy.  The one star is due to the awful Ultraviolet digital copy that comes with the disk.  Its not a simple download to your iTunes account, in fact it is NOT compatible with iTunes AT ALL!  If you want to watch it on your iPad, you have to download an app and watch it through a flixster app.  Sorry, but I won't tolerate this as a consumer.  So no more future Blu-ray purchases with this Ultraviolet crap!
B00007FOMP|3.0|Love the song \\"What's Going On\\" and have loved that song ever since when I first heard it in 1972, coming home from Spain. I had never bought this album or tape, so I guess I was hoping I would love all the other songs as much as \\"What's Going On\\", but not that impressed with some of the other songs.

B0029ATTAQ|5.0|I'm saying &#34;I Love It&#34; only because it was bought as a Christmas gift that was requested by my son. From past purchases from Amazon I can only assume that the DVD is of excellent quality and I'll have to wait until after it's opened to confirm that opinion.

0544045203|5.0|Aboard the japanese ship, Tsimtsum, 16 year old Piscine Molitar Patel and his family are traveling to Canada in hopes of a fresh start. However, one night as Pi was walking on the ship's deck, he noticed the water being unusually closer every time he looked back at it. He then gets placed on a lifeboat and shipped off to save him from the now sinking Tsimtsum. He later realizes that he's placed in the same lifeboat as Richard Parker, the bengal tiger. He must fight to survive in the middle of the Pacific by mentally dominating Richard Parker and by teamwork. Yann Martel's fantasy adventure novel brings together 2 unique characters in a fight for survival. With every passing day that Pi endured, you wanted to know what would happen and how they dealt with situations that arose periodically for example: food shortages, gathering fresh water, storms in the Pacific, etc. Pi is religious and he expresses this throughout the book, this connects to me because I am christian myself. I believe that this book should be a part of the required books that you have to read in high school or at least always have it be a choice during book projects. Its that great of a book and I believe that everyone should have the chance to read it. The ending will leave you pondering for a while but what would that be you ask? Well it depends on reader. The friendship between man and lion is something extraordinary considering their situation. This book could be compared with Max and the Cats because its similar to how the story is structured: Family are zookeepers, ship sinks, on a lifeboat with a dangerous predator, etc. I have not read Max and the Cats but I read a summary of it online and I would imagine that it would be a good book but I would still prefer Life of Pi because I could relate with it and I liked the different experiences that Pi and Richard Parker endured. I recommend this grand story of survival and friendship to everyone who likes to read. Its only 401 pages but fear not, the author takes advantage of every page to get the best experience for every reader. I believe that Yann Martel's message is that he wants us to know that even though you've gone through bad experiences in your life that as long as you never give up there will always be hope.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I discovered the book because of the movie, and I am so regretful that I didn't read it ten years ago.  (Like my forward thinking daughter did).  Life of Pi made me think about so many things and lingered on my consciousness like a wonderful wine does on the palate.  I miss it, and will most likely read it again soon.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A very thoughtful novel that includes much adventure along the way. The ultimate statement/query is that each of us makes up a story so as to interpret one's own life. How does one want to make up this interpretive story? For ultimate positive or not? And how far should one go to make up an interpretation?<br /><br />The protagonist in this novel ends up in a lifeboat with a tiger. And then has to survive with it. Who is the tiger?<br /><br />This is a wonderful book on many levels.

B001U3Y5XE|2.0|My family and I are great lovers of Lego products and thought this would be a great game.  It is not that much fun and we found that pieces that would aid in the building of an object shown on a card were not in the game box.<br />It seems to be a product that only encourages you to buy expansion packs which I was not willing to do.  When I purchase a game I want to be able to enjoy it with the contents provided.  I doubt very seriously that this game will ever make it out of the game closet again.
0385737955|4.0|I must say this book is VERY addictive.  I read it in one night. Good action scenes and kept you guessing.  Even though he kept repeating himself and used a very simple technique to keep you wondering (just simply had characters withhold information without giving a reason as to why) it made me have to keep reading to find out what was going on. It does not have huge plot twist but just enough to keep you interested.  I liked how he included a love story without making it the main storyline in the book. I myself enjoy reading about action rather than about how two teens have a crush on each other.  I found that the language was at a very young reading level. But then again that led me to finishing it within a few hours.<br /><br />It is definately not the best written story I have ever read but it was entertaining. I will definately read the other books in the series but I probably won`t admit it.  This book was definately a guilty pleasure.
B0042VJ1PI|2.0|If I didn't enjoy the Television show so much already, I certainly wouldn't start watching it after having read these books. while on a business trip I downloaded a few of these and , I have to say, the script writing for the show is better than the books! I won't be reading any more of them, that's for certain. They are a poorly written imitation of Earle Stanley Gardner and others in that genre and I am very disappointed. I'll still watch the show.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book is a great follow of the bared to you book.  There is a twist that you will not expect towards the end.  I loved the book and can't wait till May 2013 for the next one!!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|What more can really be said about this incredible album? It is an essential must buy for Donald Fagen and Steely Dan fans. Fantastic arrangements, great funky grooves and that fun quirky lyrical sense we know and love.<br /><br />I would say Sunken Condos is on equal ground to the Nightfly, and that's a bold statement. This album demands repeat plays. I find myself loading it into the transport about every third or fourth CD. As soon as the bass line from Slinky Thing kicks in I'm hooked. Sunken Condos is a compelling and enjoyable album.<br /><br />Audiophiles with high resolution systems may be challenged with the albums mastering. It sounds good but not great. With an album this fantastic, I've pushed past the sound challenges. The music seems squeezed, almost compressed into the center sound field between the speakers. There is a noticeable lack of soundstage depth and width with little layering of the instruments and vocals within the soundstage; on some songs there is an edge and harshness to the treble.<br /><br />Casual listening sessions fare much better where the sound concerns are hardly noticeable as the music has enough punch, energy and overall good sound to be less of a distraction. I'm hopeful for an audiophile re-release that this amazing album so richly deserves. This is an \\"out of the park success\\" of an album that I recommend without hesitation. Bravo Mr. Fagen!

0810989956|5.0|I bought this book against my will.  But I found it in the car and glanced at it.  I wanted to cry and was so excited and delighted with what was on my daughters thoughts and imagination.  I love it!  I will treasure this forever.  I even bought some extras so when my 2 years olds (twns) grow up, they can creatively express themselves too.  I'm afraid I won't find this book in years to come so I'd rather be safe.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|A well acted and well written movie.  There are a couple of scenes that are not for the prudish, but other than that, it is wonderful.  I may purchase this movie.

B004VMEILU|5.0|I first bought this book decades ago, but lost it in my travels, and wanted it again.<br /><br />  It is a compilation of Bruce Lee's notes [put together after his untimely death] on simplifying the whole Martial Arts thing. Mr. Lee's concept was that no one style is best. He didn't care much for Jeet Kune Do being thought of as a style. Ever here of: the style of no style? He studied all, and took the best. Did you know that he was into boxer Muhammad Ali?<br /><br />  So if you want a peek into Lee, buy this book.

B0071K5KWU|5.0|It has been over eight years since Tony Banks released his first all-orchestral album \\"Seven\\", which (as I mentioned in my review at the time) managed to be a successful instance of an artist crossing over into the classical genre in spite of the general tendency for these ventures to have dubious results.  I enjoyed \\"Seven\\" thoroughly, and I was curious and hopeful to hear more.  Banks has dedicated the last several years of his solo career solely to orchestral music, and his compositional style, even in other areas, always seemed to evoke orchestral composition as a result of its inherent complexity.<br /><br />Thankfully, Tony Banks has returned this year with \\"Six Pieces for Orchestra\\", which, as the title suggests, has one less composition than its predecessor.  Banks joked recently that if he hangs around long enough he might just make it to Zero.  Jocularity aside, \\"Six\\" happens to be even more musically adventurous than its predecessor.  Banks' compositional style outside of classical often involves unique chords and complex arrangements.  With \\"Seven,\\" when he applied these complexities, he noted that often the results, while pleasing, were more straightforward than he had expected.  As a result, with \\"Six\\", he decided that he could take the orchestra even further compositionally, which results in a more adventurous result on every track.  The orchestra turns out to be the perfect palette for Banks, and the end performance on this album is directly from his composition and not the expansive musings of an orchestrator vigorously extrapolating a simple melody (which is unfortunately a frequent occurrence for many crossovers into the classical genre).<br /><br />The most obvious differences to \\"Seven\\" are two compositions that feature a lead instrument: a violin on Blade and a saxophone on Siren.  Blade, one of my favorite tracks on the album, is played expertly by Charlie Siem, who is one of the great up-and-coming violinists, and has an expansive virtuosic solo that complements a strong melody played by the orchestra.  Siren has a solo saxophone played in a classical style by Martin Robertson.  Compositionally, the lead instrument on Siren is more tied to the overall melody of the orchestra compared to Blade.  Other tracks include Still Waters, which starts out in a darker minor key only to have a great abrupt shift to an uplifting major key by the end of the piece.  Wild Pilgrimage is a piece laden with influences of English Romanticism, and while it starts from the perspective of the track Earthlight from \\"Seven,\\" its title indicates that it is a longer-form piece, with more detail than its distant cousin from \\"Seven.\\"  The Oracle is seemingly the most straightforward melodious piece on the album, but Banks' unique compositional style is apparent in the beginning chord sequence, which invokes beauty and melancholy simultaneously in a manner rarely heard in any genre.  City of Gold is the final piece, and one of my preferred on the album, with an excellent string sequence that echoes some of the arrangements Banks made for the film \\"Lorca and the Outlaws.\\"  City of Gold also has the strong drama to make it undoubtedly a \\"credits rolling\\" completion to a great album.  Each of the song titles reflect a general storyline from beginning to end.<br /><br />The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra are featured on Six, and although they are not as well known as the London Philharmonic featured on Seven, according to Banks, they really were into these compositions and it shows in their excellent performance.  Additionally, this orchestra allowed Banks to have more rehearsals to ensure that time would be available for any changes in composition that became apparent once it was played by the full orchestra.<br /><br />The classical influences are similar to Seven, with the English Romanticism of Vaughan Williams and Elgar as the most prominent, along with Banks' own previous instrumental compositions.  Also, one can ascertainthe influence of Banks' several film compositions on some of the tracks such as Wild Pilgrimage.<br /><br />Banks himself again selected artwork from the late Stephan Knapp as he did on \\"Seven,\\" which is beautiful and appropriate for these pieces, and which provides a striking visual continuity between Banks' two orchestral albums.  The modern artistic style of Knapp is a welcome respite from the plethora of classical album covers which invariably have one of the following: a egotistic photo of the composer or performer, a nature photograph, or an ancient painting adorning the cover.  Banks' involvement in even this part of the album ensures again that the whole package is complete and uniquely reflective of its composer.<br /><br />Once again, Tony Banks stands as an exemplary exception to the large amount of mediocre crossovers into classical/orchestral music.  One hopes that it is not too soon to wish that \\"Five\\" might be on the horizon.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|What can be said about these guys that has not already been said?  Sure, they are showing their age and it's a fact that Plant cannot hit as many high notes as he did 40 years ago.  However, I feel they did a good job lowering the key to allow him to sing without straining.  This was obvious in the opening \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" but I soon adapted to the lower keys after a couple of songs.  By the time they rolled into Kashmir, I was totally captivated by their sound. I had the great privilege of seeing Zeppelin in concert on two occasions during the 70s and truthfully, there were times during this 2007 concert when they sounded better than they did back then.  Page(my all time guitar hero) trimmed the length of most of his solos, which allowed more songs to be fit into their set.  Jonesy was solid - as if he had never taken time away. Jason Bonham was a absolute beast on drums, driving the tempo with a vengeance.  His Dad would have been proud of some of the things he threw in.  I loved the way the boys interacted with Jason, clearly amazed at what he was doing. The unforgettable twinkle in Plant's eyes along with a big grin on Page's face were priceless.  It was great to see them having fun together again.<br /><br />I wish that I could have been there to see them one more time but this movie is the next best thing.  A must buy for Zeppelin fans.

B00AMBKY6W|2.0|I have faithfully watched (and purchased) every season of Gossip Girl.  Needless to say it has lost it's luster.  Somewhere around Season 4 it started to take a nose dive and has never recovered.  Unfortunately, we are still in free fall and I am (as well as other faithful fans) gritting our teeth through poor written scripts, badly directed episodes and lack luster performances to GET TO THE END!<br /><br />I just wish the writers/producers would have had a bit more respect for the faithful fans and made the last season with a bit more quality.  I wish they would have allowed the characters to find their way back to the rich and multi-faceted (although some are quite devious) people that attracted us in the first place.<br /><br />The impression I get from watching each wretched episode is that someone has thrown together a script - which seems written by the most junior of writers - and the first line directors have left town and are left with the second string.  The actors who were so stellar for three and a half seasons have become a joke.  No emotion, no charisma, dead eyes and monotone delivery.  But hey, with the crappy storyline I would be depressed going to work every day and having to mouth those pathetic lines as well.<br /><br />It's painful to watch, but alas, I WATCH.  I know!  Shame on me, but I can't help it.  I want Blair and Chuck to finally have a happy ever after.  I feel they deserve it as do we the fans that had to put up with second string episodes since the the middle of Season 4.<br /><br />My only comfort is that I have all the early episodes that I can go back and view on demand.  This is a soothing thought and gives me the strength to follow this short season to the end.<br /><br />Buy these Season 5 episodes at your own risk.  They are horrible.  If you have never seen Gossip Girl - do yourself a kindness and start with Season 1 and don't stop until Season 3.  Then buy till the middle of Season 4 and consider yourself lucky.<br /><br />It was good while it lasted, sad to see my favorite characters go but better to have it end than continue to produce such inferior product.<br /><br />Goodbye CHAIR!

B005V4FJC4|5.0|A very unique and beautiful Christmas album that is a great addition to my very lengthy Christmas playlist on my Itouch.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Any chess gamer will enjoy this app and find it challenging. It is the perfect &quot;wait in line game&quot;. You won't be disappointed.
B004KV92ZE|5.0|I love this movie! I've watched it at least 20 times and still love it every time I watch it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is the cutest most funniest game that I have ever played and I think thatvthis game would be good for small children to play.
B007HACDLK|4.0|VINCE FLYNN IS MY FAVORITE WRITER,  I LOVE TO SEE NEW ONES COMING OUT,<br />NOT ENOUGH FOR ME...THIS WAS NOT MY FAVORITE...BUT STILL GOOD

0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is a gripping and engaging first-hand account of the actual events that took place.<br /><br />Readability: The narrative is simple and straightforward.  The author gives an engaging and first-hand account of his experiences, from training, his mindset and to actual combat operations.  Considering the subject of the book, there are references to military terms, to which the ordinary reader will have to make some cross-reference to other materials.  In general, it was a light and easy read.<br /><br />Highlights:  The detailed chapters on THE operation.  (Although, this is still a raging controversy in the community, i.e., whether or not the author should have disclosed them).<br /><br />Other Highlights: The photos are a nice touch as they give you a glimpse of the life of these operators, as well as the equipment they use (for equipment junkies, there will be some drooling :-p). The illustrations made it easier for the reader to visualize what actually took place.<br /><br />The author also shows the lighter side of these operators - like how some of them look like vikings and dwarves, the author's joy in getting a tool-knife for each and every load-out kit, the author's elation at having the best guns, serviced by the best gunsmiths, etc.<br /><br />For military/action fans, this is a must-buy!
1781161097|2.0|not enough artwork, too many screenshots of the movie.  i would've liked to see more progressive concept art to show the thought process.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Arthur Christmas is an animated holiday film that is sure to become another holiday favorite.<br /><br />Arthur, representing the magic and wonder of Christmas, is the younger son of Santa Claus.  He is clumsy and secluded to work in the mail room answering letters while older brother Steve is the ultra-efficient \\"soldier\\" who has organized the thousands of elves (many in Navy SEAL style) to deliver billions of packages in a single night.  One little girl is missed, and Arthur and his grandfather steal the traditional sleigh to deliver her bike.<br /><br />Above average animation, the movie is best in carrying the heart and spirit of Christmas.  The film will be enjoyed by animation and holiday fans alike.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As a fan of John Grisham, this novel was an excellent read from start to end.  Very well done and highly recommend to anyone looking for a great story.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Oh my Word !!!!  I started crying the very first time the horse ran across the screen. He looked just like my Quarter Horse when I was in the Army.  Wonderful Memories just started flooding back in my mind. This movie is Wonderful and I think EVERYONE should see this movie. A scene reminded me of that night during WWII;  the silence of Christmas Eve;  how we are all human doing what we are told; doing what we believe in. AWESOME
159420411X|5.0|Really enjoying the book. Silver's discussion of baseball and financial data analysis makes for a great read. Great review of the housing bust and the lack of responsibility of the banks and rating agencies.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is an awesome movie about Black History of  Pilots during WWII. The story line is great and of course there has to be some romance.  Loved this Movie.  Wish they would make one of the Buffalo Soldiers (Army) like they did Red Tails (Air Force)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I seldom read a book twice in a row, but this is an exception to that rule.  I was incredibly moved, inspired, and challenged.
B000002KEV|5.0|This is an awesome CD  Love Deep Purple  Would refer this to anyone and all my friends' who loves music
0446554995|1.0|After reading several previous Pendergast books I was so upset when the authors killed off Helen in the first few chapters. I feel like a sucker having gone through several books all with the hope that they would have some time together but they hardly gave them more then a few minutes.  The rest was just boring to me.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|love, love, love. love this app! I am such the weather buff and love this app and all of its options for me!
0739368435|5.0|Don't let the funny title put you off. I loved the book, so I bought the recording to listen to when traveling. The cast did an incredible job of voicing this extraordinary story about the German occupation of Guernsey, and brought this well written historical fiction to life.Several friends have now enjoyed this book,
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|really, how can you go wrong with Majong Deluxe? this is hours of fun on a snowy winter day anywhere!
B00ANIEU7S|5.0|It started out good.  The plot drew me in, and each episode makes the series better.  Well done.  Interesting that the hero doesn't have super powers and he doesn't call himself Green Arrow.  I like that he simply paints his face for camouflage to better hide half of it in the dark of the hood, and doesn't wear a lone ranger mask.  Very different.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|I can't stop listening to this song. It's a relatively new genre/sound that I'd love to hear more of. I'll definitely be keeping tabs on awolnation for future releases.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This show was created by the team that gave us 24. That show had its glimmer of brillance at times about CTU a special Terrorist Unit, but went way off the plot cliff at times. Example Kim Bauer and the Mountain Lion.<br />This show is about the CIA tracking terriorist and it works. It does get close to the plot cliff edge but makes a left turn that shocks and delights us as a viewer. The acting in great here and Mandy Pantkin reminds us what a great actor he can be when he wants to.<br />This won numberous emmys and deserved every one of them.
B00471TLZS|5.0|It was great then and it's still great today.. Some shows,<br />last the test of time and this is one of them. The women<br />really seem to enjoy it, maybe because they're more<br />spiritual ?  Not sure, still a great all time favorite.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great mind puzzle.  This is very challenging and cant put it down.  Love the colors and the different sizes of the grids. Great choice and well worth it.  Was a free puzzle.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Forays into history and twisting the events found therein and giving them a horror slant is becoming incredibly popular. Author Seth Grahame- Smith leads the charge with such projects as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter; and his latest work Unholy Night, which is set to put a horror spin on the biblical tale of the Three Wise Men...<br />I love historical horror romps, zombies and post-apocalyptica and so, Exit Humanity was naturally attractive to me.<br /><br />However, warily, I started to watch Exit Humanity and was almost immediately impressed when I was greeted by a narrative from Brian Cox (Braveheart, The Ring, Troy, Manhunter) and a brief battle scene from the American Civil War, with the addition of the undead!<br />As opposed to many zombie/infected films, Exit Humanity does not rely on gore or flesh-rending scenes to pad out proceedings. In fact, Exit Humanity is very much about the lead character Edward Young and how he copes with the bleak events which he faces. Relative newcomer Mark Gibson (Monster Brawl, Psych) delivers a believable performance as Young and is ably supported throughout by Adam Seybold and Jordan Hayes (Nostrum, 2012's House at the end of the Street); and surprisingly, by horror regulars such as Bill Moseley as the maniacal General Williams (The Devil's Rejects, Army of Darkness, House of 1000 Corpses), Stephen McHattie (A Little Bit Zombie, Watchmen, Red: Werewolf Hunter) and a turn from an almost unrecognisable Dee Wallace (The Holwing, Cujo, Critters) who gives proceedings greater depth with her expository role.<br /><br />There were points during proceedings when this film could have veered off the precipice and become a straightforward action-horror. However, writer and director John Geddes has created something special with Exit Humanity and manages to marry up the performances of his actors, an appropriate score, quality special effects by The Brothers Gore (Jeff & Jason Derushie) and bleak, bleached footage perfectly to create an atmosphere that are absent from much larger projects, never mind a small independent film.<br /><br />At times, I was reminded of a number of different films, most notably The Outlaw Josey Wales. This may seem strange but I submit to you that Exit Humanity and Josey Wales both have as their central characters hardy men who are haunted by the events of their past and Exit Humanity does indeed have a kind of Western vibe to it.<br /><br />I loved Exit Humanity. It is an ambitious horror tale that does an incredible amount with a very modest budget. However, it won't be for everyone. I suspect that fans of the zombie sub-genre may be left a little disappointed since the pace of the film is distinctly more relaxed than your average undead/infected flick. Additionally, there are brief interludes of animation which may not fit with the majority's impression of conventional horror films. To my mind, Exit Humanity dared to be different and pulls it off incredibly well.<br /><br />Exit Humanity is not only a tremendously powerful horror film; but simply a tremendous film that is rendered all the more impressive when factoring in that it is an independent production.ched footage perfectly to create an atmosphere that are absent from much larger projects, never mind a small independent film.<br /><br />At times, I was reminded of a number of different films, most notably The Outlaw Josey Wales.

0307277887|3.0|I have never seen the show, but reading the reviews, it sounds like one of those rare instances where the show is better than the book.  I found this book to be just okay.  It has such an intriguing premise I figured I wouldn't be able to put it down, yet I was VERY able to put it down.  Dexter came off as creepy and not nearly as likeable as I would have expected for this type of guy.  I mean, if you are going to try to humanize a serial killer, you better make me want to grab a beer with him and have some laughs.  The Dexter in the book was no such character to me.  I thought he was creepy, insecure, and weird.  The pace was a lot slower than I expected as well.<br /><br />I'm not saying this is a horrible book, but since reading it I haven't recommended it to anyone, and probably won't.
034580404X|5.0|A very adventurous read, takes you on a journey of discovery and passion, great read. EL James can tell a great story!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I could not wait for this movie to be released on blu ray/dvd, since I was a big fan of 'Batman Begins' and especially 'The Dark Knight' so I did not know if they could really top 'The Dark Knight', and I wasn't expecting them to, and they did not, BUT don't let that deter from this excellent finale, because this film is really really good, and I was not let down at all, infact, this is my 2nd favorite in the series, falling right behind the mighty 'The Dark Knight'.<br /><br />Now I don't want to play spoiler for people who haven't seen it yet, but I will comment on the cast and crew, now at first when I heard Anne Hathaway would play 'Catwoman' I wasn't sure that this was the role for her, but man oh man, did she surprise me, she plays the part like she should have, because Catwoman should be sleek and sexy, and sassy, and she sure is, this could be the role that propells her to better film roles in the future, she has the ability, Tom Hardy as Batmans nemesis 'Bane' and he really shines, he looks menacing, and the tone of his voice is just perfect, dark and fits the role to a T, and I was delighted to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as I've come to think of him as an excellent character actor, 'Inception' really made me take notice of him, and him and Christopher Nolan seem to work well off each other, and of course Gary Oldman returns as Jim Gordon, and I always thought he did a great job with this role, normally he'd play the bad guy, which he's very good at as well, but this role is perfect for him, and of course you have good ole Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, and watching Morgan Freeman act just never gets old, and the old man still has it, and to my delight, Cillian Murphy reprises his role as 'Scarecrow' and although he's not in it much, but I really like this guy, after first seeing him in 'Batman Begins' and then 'Inception' another excellent character actor, so that should tell you the acting in this movie is superb, and everyone knows Christian Bale is justphenomenal as Batman, and that does not change this time around either, you can tell he loved playing this role.<br /><br />And of course the masterful Christopher Nolan does another fantastic job directing this epic, he has made it into my list of favorite directors with this series and 'Inception', and I like that he keeps his movies serious and not filled with stupid comedy like a lot of movies today, he keeps it serious and dark, and he really knows how to get the best out of his cast and crew.<br /><br />And boy does this movie look fantastic on blu ray, especially the shots of Gotham City, just like 'The Dark Knight', the buildings and skyscrapers just jump off the screen, the extras are a BIT lacking, but you do get an excellent documentary about the history of the mighty Batmobile, and you get an in depth making of too, and it's really good, I'm sure this will be re-released eventually with more extras, because I think they are planning on releasing a new box set next year, so I'm sure we'll have some new extras with that, but this will definetly do for now.<br /><br />Excellent movie, excellent end to the series, did not disappoint, and I'm really fussy.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I love the case with the full color pics and the Bluray has the US and UK versions of the film.
0131103628|5.0|I think the title and K&R are enough to say for this book.....<br /><br />//one two three four five words required
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|This was Rankin at his best. Lots of twists and turns, Rebus being his usual bolshie self and still solving the mystery. Great read!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|this whole album is awesome.  I'm obsessed with it!  great way to dance my way through the day!  why haven't you bought it yet?
0446547654|3.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books and this one is just like the others. Don't want to give anything away, but it is a typical Sparks book.
0761171703|5.0|I bought this as a gift, but of course wanted to flip through it first...  however there is no flipping through this book.  I ended up sitting on my couch for an hour, looking at every picture.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I have been enjoying the play but is a bit time intense if I want to get to a particular goal.  I don't spend money on extras however as the game has been easily playable without.  good game for an older child or tween.
B002ZG9774|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  The music is great and Cher and Christina sing their hearts out.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I rented this movie after reading the first 5 or 6 reviews thinking it would be hilarious. I laughed maybe 4 times toward the beginning and then... it became an un-funny, predictable waste of 1.75 hours.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I was expecting something like smallville but it's better. It's a new way of looking st the green arrow. It's edgey.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I never thought that reading about habits could be so riveting and exciting. Very thorough book. Includes anything you would ever want to read about habits and how to create them. Easy to ready too
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This is a gripping and sometimes raw book but with enough redemption at the finish to leave the reader feeling hopeful.  The interweaving of the Victorian notion of the Language of Flowers was superb. Victoria struck me as definately on the Autistic spectrum and yet having found her own way to communicate with others was able to reach out to them. I loved this book!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book just like the two others. Beautiful book and really well and thoroughly researched. I highly recommend this book.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|The plot, the writing, the characters, the time-warp.  Every single aspect of this book is outstanding.  The mind boggles at the authors ability to craft this tale!
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver is just killing it right now. Very interesting book for anyone who works in a business that involves making predictions or bets on the future. And just a real interesting read in general.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Outstanding!  I never saw the end coming. Beautiful character development and sympathetic storytelling.. I loved this tale of devastation and survival.
B004WR125O|5.0|Purchased to go with the Onkyo TX-NR616. Plugged it in, went through the setup and it connected the receiver to my network. Can't get much easier.
B009A87X80|3.0|We love and truly appreciate Eva Cassidy.  This &#34;best of&#34; is not our favorite of the CDs we have.  We rate both Songbird and Time After Time as 5 stars.  We bought them used as could not locate new.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. It has a good story line and Amanda Bynes is great portraying the role
B0048Y9TPG|5.0|She's always great and really lifts your spirit with her songs.  I never get over being amazed by her range and her amazing vocals.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|the best movie.  I remember seeing this in the theaters when I was about 7 with my Mom. We loved it and since then I have seen it numerous times, I reallyenjoy it every time I watch it
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season of this show so i was intrigued to watch the second.  I have seen the first episode so far and really like it.  I have heard from numerous people that season 2 is even better!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved this season!  I never watched before being recommended to.  I Watched 1 episode in Season 3 then wanted to know more.  I then watched Seasons 1 & 2 in a mater of 2 days!  I am now addicted to this series.
B009DJB8I2|3.0|This is soundtrack is nice, it gives you a very large amount of songs for the price(despite them being free from valve. You do get these in a higher quality format and in a nice case to take with you on your car. The tracks themselves have cool little images of the various cores, which was a realllllly great touch. The CD also includes a code for a TF2 item as well as a DOTA 2 invite key.<br /><br />Now I do have a small problem with the music from this soundtrack itself, the music is great, but it really feels out of place when your not playing portal. I am comparing this to other video game soundtracks when I say quite a few of these songs just feel out of place and lack any really depth to stand on there own two feet with out the atmosphere they are helping create in game. When I got hold of a soundtrack like bastions, the music really stands on its own 2 feet and is something I really want to listen to and go out of my way to, in its own way the portal soundtrack just does not feel like its meant to be listened to by itself. It feels like I'm eating an oreo with out any cream, sure it tastes good, but there is always just something missing.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a fascinating book on the issue of tissue culture and its significant impact on the development of diagnosis and treatment of common and uncommon diseases.  The tissue was taken from an African-American woman when she presented herself for treatment at Johns Hopkins. Hospital in Baltimore.  Her cells, called Hela cells after their host, Henrietta Lacks, turned out to be unique and useful as they grew rapidly and did not die as others did.  Henrietta died of cervical cancer, but her cells lived on and so are immortal.  Her family had limited understanding of the disease she carried within.or the significance of the immortality of the cells.  The author alternates the biology with an indepth narrative of Henrietta, her family and her background.  These issues are with us today as researchers seek our consent for treatments and protect our privacy in treatment, none of which was the case in Henrietta's unfortunate experience.  It would not have saved her life, but would have provided her and her family with privacy and dignity.
B008XCM18Q|3.0|A little too complicated, but better than the movie.  It takes a while to figure out the intrigue.  But it is still an interesting read.
B005OI1124|5.0|Very good book little slow at first the whole back story but when it got good I had a very hard time putting the book down. It's been so time since I read such a good book.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|A habit, once entrenched, becomes invisible to you as the habit loop runs without any conscious effort.<br /><br />I found this book hugely enlightening in all 3 of the domains that it examines i.e. individual, businesses and communities.<br /><br />The insights will help me personally (there are some routines I have to change!). It will also be invaluable to the individual coaching clients and the organistations that I work with. I have just started a contract to turn a highly dysfunctional government department into an effective one, and the insight is to look for that keystone habit that can trigger a chain reaction to transform the whole department.<br /><br />It is understandable that many of life's routines need to become automatic in order for us to successfully navigate life, but it is disturbing when these routines have negative consequences, and we can't seem to change them.<br /><br />Now that we know about the habit loop we can examine the routines in any given habit loop, and change them to achieve the same rewards but without the negative consequences.<br /><br />This well researched work with many practical examples gets my highest recommendation.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|I bought this album a couple of years ago. Today I just send one in form of a gift to a friend of mine. This album goes deep. It is extraordinary and it took me a couple of times to \\"understand\\" it. But once I got it, it made sense and I just do not get bored of it. This album is quite different from other Mehteny albums, especially becuase of the unique voice of Anna Maria Jopek.<br />Although probably understanding not a single word, listening to the album you will hear a story that makes sense.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I bought one of these from another seller a couple of months earlier. It was branded &#34;Innoo Tech&#34;. This time I bought 4 as stocking stuffers, but each cost about half of what I paid last time. The grip is maintained by a spring inside the expandable arm, but the problem is that the spring recoil is too strong so it's very difficult to place the phone inside & looks like it'll break while your phone is being held. What I did was remove the screw holding the 2 pieces together & replaced the spring with one I found laying around my home. A spring from the tape loading mechanism of an old VCR will do as long as the tension is right. You might have to bend the ends to get it to hook properly. Once it's attached you can put the pieces back together. To use it with an iPhone 5 or similarly larger phone, file down the plastic tabs on the side of the expandable arm so that it can open wide enough for larger phones, and voila! You have a truly universal smart phone holder!<br /><br />As for the tripods, what people who receive these as gifts do with them is up to them. But as for the one I bought for myself, I kept the head & threw away the legs.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love this cable.  It is long enough to reach those &#34;hidden&#34; receptacles.  I love the white cable, so different from the standard black.  And it is versatile!! I use it for re-powering several of my electronic devices.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|If you have any doubt about the meaning of the phrase &#34;the greatest generation&#34; read this book. You will thank God such men were on our side.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Was happy to see them make another one didn't think it would be as good as the first one but they prove me wrong this one was way better times 10 then the first one
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This was a great movie, followed the book very well.  Only complaint is the camera isn't steady for a lot of the movie.  I saw it in theaters and felt motion sickness.  It is much better at home on TV.  Hopefully they will hold the camera still for the second movie.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Great movie enjoy it 90% of the movie had me laughing. Will be buying this movie to add to my other moives.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|can the coins keep coming????? The game is fun to play but tan you have to wait for the time and coins to catch up with wach other
B009HELT3C|4.0|Never would of though they make another. Glade the did was a good movie the curveball in the end never saw it coming.
B000I0QL82|5.0|The product was exactly what I expected and arrived on time and in great condition. This was a DVD with two movies, so I got a bonus.
B004ZJZQ7O|5.0|IMO you dont really need this movie in bluray... but im a bluray fan so i got it anyway.  This is also probably my favorite movie.  Gives a little history lesson on the American Drug problem during the Vietnam era and how they were able to operate their street pharmacy business.  Also should how crooked Police were during this time, which probably why the people of America dont trust police even till this day.  Regardless, this is a must see movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not a romance novel reader, and refused to read these books until one day I was bored and the first book was the only thing around. And from that moment on, it was glued to my hand. I am normally a very slow reader, because I only read at night to &#34;shut my brain off&#34; so i can go to sleep, and I ended up reading all three books in one weekend. Obvisouly it wasn't wise for me to read them at night since it did the opposite of what most books do.  I also got a few of my friends to read them, that again don't read these types of books normally, and a couple of them finished all three in one weekend as well.<br />Book three is my favorite of the trilogy and I hope that Mrs. James continues with the series in the way that this one ended. I would love to see the world through Christian Grey's eyes!!!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was a really good plot and great story telling. Some of her work is a little reduntant but this was good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved all three books.  As I said in the other reviews, if you can get past the soft porn, the story is great.  I was actually shocked when I first read some of the soft porn in this the first book I read...but I was able to read round it.  When I got to the part of the story that explained it, the story made more since.  I thoroughly enjoyed all three books of the trilogy and hope there will be more of Christian and Anastasia.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Like some people l'm sure, Ellie's hit song &#34;Lights&#34; brought me to this album, and I do enjoy that song very much.  I liken her voice at times to a hoarse Dolly Parton, or maybe a songbird with something to prove.  The way it soars about on songs on this album is probably what I like most about it.  I appreciate her attempts to stretch beyond typical dance/electronic music, and also enjoy the moments where she sort of relishes in it as well.  There are sparse moments along with lavishly constructed soundscapes and her voice works well in both cases.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|if you look beyond the soft porn, all three books have great story line, of love above all, love greater than all
B002X9KVBY|5.0|I love these movies.  They make me laugh and I can also relate to Bridget who is a single woman looking for love and making good and bad choices.  These are my \\"go to\\" movies when I want to laugh and just feel good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The entire trilogy was a very good read, if you can look past the soft porn.  I'm glad I was reading it on my Kindle so I didn't have people judging me by what I was reading, because it really is a good book.  The story line is great.  All three books are a must if you are going to understand the story. Enjoyed it very much and hope it is not the end of Christian and Anastasia..oh my how that name roles of the tongue. LOL
B00899F0G8|5.0|I enjoy watching this show to try to find out who is A! It is one of those shows where you can get definitely get addicted!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I loved the movie, but I could not get through the book.  Very slow reading and I finally gave up.
B005FITIF0|4.0|I liked this movie because it shows the passion of a new believer to right a wrong.  I also like that he actually did something with his faith although the means by which he righted the wrong may not justify the end.<br /><br />Though based on a true story we never really know how much the truth has been changed for the sake of the movie.<br /><br />I appreciate that the hero wasn't portrayed as a perfect &#34;Rambo-like&#34; individual but as a real person who is making mistakes as he is &#34;working out his salvation&#34;.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I liked the format.  It's a bit unique in that it ends chapters with recipes and running tips and while at first I questioned whether they fit in with the story, I found myself looking forward to what recipe ideas he would have next.  The training tips were oftentimes thought-provoking and helpful too.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the story.  I like how he weaves his personal story throughout.  By providing a context for how he got into running, his family background, and details about himself and his friends, it makes the race reports all the more enjoyable.  Being new to ultras myself, I found the race info captivating and motivating.<br /><br />The only constructive criticism I have is that I think the book would have been enriched with additional attention to his struggles along the way.  While he does finish the book with some of his tough times and solid introspection, I think the book could have been more well-rounded with more insight into what he was thinking when he didn't do as well or when he dropped out of races.  It's clear he's really focused and thoughtful by the way he tells of his victories.  Adding more insight into what goes on in his mind when defeated would probably have enriched the story.  Overall though, this criticism does not detract from the book but is merely something I was left wanting.  I still think it's a 5 star book and one I am quick to recommend.

1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink's \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right Brainers will Rule the Future\\" is probably one of the best non-fiction books that explains and clarifies the dramatic changes that the U.S. has recently witnessed in the 21st century and how these changes has an effect on our lives. He provides fascinating insights about how different parts of our brains are used for different types of tasks and he provides ideas of how to channel the usage of the various properties of our brain. He also discusses six innate senses which are of utmost importance in today's modern society and which need to be enhanced in order for one to survive the revolutionary transformation of our day and age.<br /> Pink begins his book by describing a past experience when he participated as a volunteer in a research project at the National Institute of Mental Health. His contribution was volunteering to be part of a control group where his brain activity was scanned and observed by professionals through an MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging. While inside of the machine, Pink was asked to perform a few activities. In the first activity he was shown a picture of a woman with a face which displayed emotions of fear. Then, he was shown two pictures of a man displaying different emotions in each picture. He was assigned to compare the most similar picture to the previous one. With the second activity he was required to identify whether certain photographs were indoors or outdoors. After completing both tasks, he viewed the results of the scan with the neurologist, who showed him how the left hemisphere of his brain was more active while he was labeling a series of pictures as \\"indoors\\" or \\"outdoors\\" and how the right hemisphere of his brain was more active when he was asked to compare the faces which were most similar.<br /> The brain's right and left hemispheres are dramatically different, perhaps even opposite, in their functions. The left side of the brain is, in a way, the computer-like section of our brains. It is analytical, rational and logical. When we read and write we are using the left side of our brains. This side involve dealing with the individual aspects or details of a whole in a manner of sequence. Thus, the \\"indoor/outdoor\\" task was accomplished through using the resources provided by the left hemisphere because concentrating on the details of the photo is of most importance in solving the problem. Sudoku puzzles and crisscross puzzles would mostly use the left side of the brain because they are solved by sequentially focussing on particular details, may they be numbers or words.<br /> The right side of our brains, however, is what differentiates humans from robots and computers. The right side of our brain recognizes patterns, detects the way details interconnect to make a full and entire whole, it observes the bigger picture. This allows for the right side to interpret emotions and nonverbal expressions in an instant, without the need for sequence or analysis.<br /> Pink summed up the right/left brain distinctions into four key points. The first is that \\"our brains are \\"contralateral\\"-each half of the brain controls the other half of the body\\" (Pink, 2005). This is true regarding which body part we move, such as turning the right foot uses the left hemisphere. However, it is also surprisingly true regarding the direction we are moving in, such as turning your head from right to left uses the right side. When you turn your head from right to left you are using you The second is that the sequential/simultaneous difference. The third point is the text/context difference and the fourth is the difference between seeing details and seeing the big picture.<br /> Pink makes it profoundly clear throughout the book that the two hemispheres are equally important in everyday activities, both at home and at work. To illustrate this point, Pink describes a scenario in the \\"text/context\\" section where a spouse forgot to buy an essential ingredient for that night's dinner. \\"The other spouse grabs the car keys, curls a lip, glares at you, and hisses \\"I'm going to the store\\" (Pink, 2005).  The left hemisphere interpreted the words in their literal meaning. This will merely teach you that your spouse has gone to the store. However, the right side of your brain will teach you that your spouse is pissed off at you. Both sides have equally contributed to your understanding of the situation.<br /> The importance of both text and context in languages such as Hebrew and Arabic also illustrate the equality of the right and left hemispheres. These languages do not consist of any vowels. The reader must consider the lettering of words and their surrounding concepts and ideas in order to find out which vowel to use. Reading these languages entails the collaboration of both hemispheres since they require the reader to make sense of text and context. Thus, the language reads appropriately from right to left. As mentioned earlier, movements from the right to the left require the right side of our brain. This is amazingly perfect because these languages also require the brain's right-side understanding of context. English, on the other hand, mostly requires the analysis of text and is, therefore, appropriately read from left to right, using left-brain power.<br /> Pink describes the present 21st century as an age which is transforming from The Informational Age to The Conceptual Age. To illustrate the differences between these ages, consider what aspects of humanity were most important for succeeding in these times. In The Industrial Age, for example, physical strength was probably the most important trait one could have because it was in that point in time where factories and assembly lines were born and in full use. People who were fluently knowledgeable and analytical were most likely to succeed in The Informational Age because education became more widespread and attainable to all. The left side of the brain was the main source of the success in that age. Jobs which require a primary focus on left-brain thinking, or L-Directed thinking, include lawyers, doctors, accountants, and so on.  Society was very L-directed in their thinking and almost disregarded R-directed thinking.  It is for this reason that the previous generation expected their children to become doctors and lawyers. However, the question remains: why is it quite likely that these parents were disappointed by their children turning them down and heading in a career direction opposing that which was laid out and prepared for them? Why is R-directed thinking becoming equally important in our lives as L-directed thinking?  Why is it that \\"more Americans today work in arts, entertainment, and design than work as lawyers, accountants, and auditors\\" (Pink, 2005, pg. 55)? What are the causes behind the transformation between The Informational and Conceptual ages?<br /> Pink's theory is based on three factors which detract from L-directed thinking which had always been considered the most and, in turn, attracts R-directed thinking: Abundance, Asia, and Automation. It is important to note that his theory by no means insists that L-directed thinking is being replaced by R-directed and high-touch thinking; rather his theory suggests that L-directed thinking is necessary but not sufficient. High-sense skills are now needed more than any time in history because of the three factors.<br /> Asia refers to the fact that many L-directed jobs are now being transferred to people in other countries because of the salary pay is substantially cheaper. Forrester Research claims that \\"3.3 million white-collar jobs and $136 billion in wages will shift from the U.S. to low-cost countries like India, China, and Russia\\" (Pink, 2005, pg. 39). The factor of Automation is similar to Asia in the sense that U.S. jobs are being replaced. Only, Automation refers to the fact that technology and computers are replacing many U.S. jobs. Modern technology has made many tasks faster and cheaper to accomplish, inevitably replacing many L-directed jobs.<br /> Pink describes six high-concept and high-touch senses which have become crucial in today's day and age of conceptualization. The factor of Abundance is directly correlated to the first of these senses: Design. The abundance of goods and services has skyrocketed in the past decade or two immensely and has practically provided us with an unlimited amount of selection and variety. This creates a very fierce struggle between those who compete in a given market or field of expertise  because they are playing a game in which the term \\"survival of the fittest\\" determines who will be victorious and who will plummet into failure. Companies cannot produce goods which are merely sufficient in meeting customer satisfaction. They need to design products which are beautiful and significant. Pink describes Design as \\"utility enhanced by significance\\" (2005, pg.70). Studies show that cell phone consumers spend just as much money on decorative faceplates and ringtones as much as they spend on the phones themselves. Georgetown University found that when \\"students, teachers, and educational approaches remained the same, improving schools' physical environment could increase test scores as much as 11 percent\\" (Pink, 2005, pg.82).<br /> The second high-touch sense is Story. Personal narratives have become urgently prevalent as a way of finding a deeper understanding and deeper meaning within ourselves and others. Marketing techniques have increasingly incorporated story narratives behind their products or services in order to convey a sense of meaning and purpose to the costumer. Story delivers an emotional impact which enhances the mere context of the facts. People remember things better if they are sugar-coated with an elegant story because it enriches the product with emotion and causes it to stand out from the rest. This is essential in today's age where there is a vast selection of practically anythingon the market and people enjoy associating themselves with something that has meaning and significance, let alone sheer value. For example, wines have fancy narratives on their labels and major car insurance agencies compete with each other by trying to sell a better story in their advertisements (I personally love Gieko's gecko).<br /> The third sense is called Symphony. This is the ability to put together the many pieces of a large picture and to gather seemingly unrelated details into a whole, rather than simply focusing on and analyzing the details which openly present themselves. A conductor of a symphony or a composer of a song collaborates many instruments, performers, notes, and musical ideas for the result of hearing a unified and harmonious sound. Managers and entrepreneurs highly rely on this ability because they are responsible for levels of productivity of systems which consist of and are based on many intricate relationships and interconnections. In fact, creativity is highly linked to this aptitude. As Pink puts it \\"sometimes the most powerful ideas come from simply combining two existing ideas nobody else ever thought to unite\\" (Pink, 2005, pg.137). Studies show that self-made millionaires are four times more likely to be dyslexic than the rest of the population. Dyslexic people have difficulty with L-directed thinking which allows people to reason and think with sequence and in a manner which focuses on details. The same way a blind person is forced to develop an increased sensitivity with hearing, the same is true with dyslexic people who lack L-directed thinking. They develop increases in their R-directed thinking in order to compensate for their dyslexia and, consequently, they become amazing pattern detectors and they begin seeing the intricate connections and relationships which many others cannot see. Pink quotes Sid Caesar who said \\"the guy who invented the wheel is an idiot. The guy who invented the other three, he was a genius\\" (Pink, 2005,pg. 142).<br /> The fourth sense is called Empathy. Pink illustrates this skill by narrating a tiring and slow morning experience from the time he forced himself out of bed to the time he was at his desk at work drinking his third cup of coffee...and yawning. He describes how he yawns and then asks the reader \\"In the past minute, have you yawned?\\"  It is said that yawning is contagious, however, this is true if the person has the capacity and aptitude of attuning oneself to another, to place oneself in the shoes of another, and feel what it is their feeling. This skill uses emotional intelligence and it allows us to read facial expressions through R-directed thinking, just as Pink discovered by analyzing which parts of his brain were most active after he had matched facial expressions in the MRI. The emotional and empathetic power of humans cannot be replicated by computers nor could they be handed to foreign employees in other countries. Clinton was criticized when he uttered the words \\"I feel your pain.\\" These were words of emotion and critics considered him as not being presidential and manly enough to keep emotions out. Pink describes this point in time as the birth of the revolution.<br /> The fifth sense is called Play. Pink describes this high-touch ability by contrasting Henry Ford's work/play philosophy and Southwest Airlines' mission statement. Henry Ford's stated \\"When we are at work we ought to be at work. When we are at play we ought to be at play. There is no use trying to mix the two.\\" Ford lived in grim and serious times where R-directed was hardly relevant to succeeding. Southwest Airlines, one of the most stable and successful airline, stated that \\"People rarely succeed at anything unless they are having fun doing it.\\" Video games have recently been increasingly popular, more popular than the movie industry.  The typical American devotes 75 hours a year playing video games and Nintendo's Mario video game series has earned $7 billion over the course of their lifetime which is double the revenue of all the Star Wars movies combined. The sense of Play explains why Pop culture and entertainment has become an essential focus of today's society.<br /> The sixth sense is called Meaning. The truth is that Pink uses Meaning as a way to summarize the motivation behind why the other senses have become integral to succeed in our lives. Many agencies and companies are incorporating a sense of spirit, spirituality and meaning into their everyday work. It is what motivates us into believing in a purpose greater than ourselves. This requires us to overlook our personal and monetary interests and, and focusing on our work for the sake of work itself and for the sake of its contribution to society. In the present day and age we are forced to focus on our high-touch senses in order to tap into a higher degree of meaningfulness and purpose.<br /> As my lengthy review testifies, this book was probably the most enjoyable non-fiction book I have ever read. I practically agreed to every concept and theory and I have even theorized similar ideas in the past. I also loved the fact that the book was written in a very \\"down-to-earth\\" style and I was able to relate to in a very practical manner. The book was very insightful in regard to my future because I am now more aware of skills that are truly important in a world of competitiveness and abundance. The book showed me a whole new light into the world and into my life.

B0045I3EJC|5.0|I happened upon this movie a couple of years ago- someone had uploaded it to a video site, and while the compression was bad, and it had russian subtitles, I enjoyed it, from beginning to end.  I spent the next year waiting for the local video shops to get it- unfortunately, my wait was in vain- it stubbornly refused to appear on the shelves- even of shops that specialized in foreign/obscure films.  I week ago, I went to the local shop to try and order it, and was told that not only could it not be ordered, but it was actually out of print.<br /><br />I immediately ordered it via amazon, and when it arrived, I sat down, and watched it.  The only word I can come up with to describe this film is \\"perfect.\\"  From beginning to end, you are taken on a mind-bending journey that is at one time familiar, and at others evocative, and still others strikingly imaginative.  The moment the final credits rolled, I had to sit and watch it in its entirety again- after two viewings, I want to see it again, but am pacing myself.<br /><br />You will not regret seeing this film- you will only regret missing it, when it disappears from the shelves to make way for far lesser offerings.

He was wise enough to hire all three rivals and 2 Democrats after his election because he knew enough to surround himself with intelligent and hard working people. Getting to know his \\"former\\" rivals and what they though of Lincoln in their own words was a joy!

You can't tell normally, especially if using a charger that puts out less than the 2 amp level of the official amazon ChargeFast charger. This app tells you immediately that the charger is connected and that charging is occurring (even the charging light in the Fire does not come on immediately with a 1 amp std USB charger. it takes several minutes. And the battery icon never changes to show it is charging. )  While it's clearly designed for smartphones, this app does the job with the Fire, providing estimated charge times, estimates of how long battery will last when performing different functions and even a chart showing you how fast your charger is charging the device over the long term.  Can't beat it for free.  Pay a little extra to get it without ads. Amazon should have included its own app for this on every Fire. Inexcusable that it does not. Or that it did not include a charger in the first place.
B008L1VZS6|5.0|Rousing overtures and intermezzi! Scintillating ensemble pieces matching all six principals and chorus, with impressively complex counterpoint! A madcap but crafty libretto! Two pairs of lovers, the charming innocents and the proud veterans of romantic combat! An absurd dotard of a father and a loathsome pompous fool of a favored suitor! An irrepressible chorus of servants, cooks, and courtiers churning in and out of scenes! Above all, a musical score of wit and originality ... errr, ummm, \\"originality\\" might be hard to prove, since so much of the music sounds remarkably like \\"William Tell\\" retuned for frivolity. Be that as it may, this is the finest Rossini opera giocosa that the real Gioacchino never composed! How appropriate that its plot is constructed around an imposter!<br /><br />\\"Un Giorno di Regno\\" was Giuseppe Verdi's second opera, his first comedy, and his first resounding bust. It closed after one performance in Milan on September 5th, 1840. It flubbed so dismally that Verdi wrote twenty-nine serious/tragic operas in a row before attempting a second comedy. The stock explanation for the failure of \\"un Giorno di Regno\\" is that a fickle public had lost interest in comic opera and craved only bathetic melodrama. A more plausible explanation is that the premiere was badly sung, that all the principals were heavy-timbred wooden bellowers who muddled the Rossini-esque fast patter and who couldn't assemble themselves as agilely as required for the challenging ensembles that are the centerpieces of this opera. The era of Bel Canto had closed, its polished vocal technique replaced by the gargantuan voices of the \\"grand\\" opera houses. Still I defy anyone to explain why this exuberant entertainment has been so long neglected.<br /><br />This production is excellent enough, I think, to launch \\"Un Giorno di Regno\\" into the international repertoire. The six principals are all so well suited to their roles, both vocally and dramatically, that one could imagine Verdi had composed specifically with their voices and faces in mind. Anna Antonacci is perfect as the imperious, vengeful Marchesa del Pioggio; her disdainful beauty suits the character and her imposing sonorities suit the music that calls upon her to soar above the melee of the ensembles. Paolo Bordogna, in the slapstick role of the opportunist Treasurer, blends absurdity and musicality in his Bel/Bawl Canto. Guido Loconsolo, the imposter King of Poland who turns out to be the repentant lover of the Marchesa, uses his imposing physique and his truly regal baritone to command the mis en scene throughout. The only tenor in the cast, Ivan Magri in the role of the poor-but-sincere lover Edoardo, sings so thrillingly that I run out of adjectives for his performance. He's \\"Bel Canto\\" resurrected.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Words cannot express how amazing an album this is. I don't know how Rush could ever top this one. I have my all-time favorite Rush songs from the past, but this is by far my favorite Rush album. Every single song knocks my socks off. I can't say that about any other Rush album; there are always a few great songs, but not all of them are killer like they are on this album.<br /><br />There is nothing that I do not like about this effort. Guitars: excellent. Drumming: excellent. Production: beyond excellent. Geddy Lee's voice: Better than I've ever heard him. And can we talk about his Bass playing/sound??? (yeah, I'm a bass player) I've never heard such a great rock tone ANYWHERE. Geddy gets the nastiest, ballsiest, tightest, crunchy J-bass tone I've ever heard out of him. It's the perfect tone for this kind of rock. His playing is impeccable--more so that his usual greatness; his lines are jaw-dropping astounding.<br /><br />This album is a contender for my favorite rock album of all time from any artist. Dare I say Rush has reached their brand of rock perfection with this one?

B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|We have a 4 year old Star Wars LEGO fanatic.  He LIVES for Star Wars LEGOS, LEGO video games, clothing...you name it.  We bought him his first LEGO CITY Advent calendar last year which was a huge hit.  When we saw the Star Wars version, we were ecstatic.  The excitement turned to disappointment with the poor build opportunities offered in the box this year.  My son had no clue what ships he is building based on his expertise with all things Star Wars LEGOS.  At first I told him that they must be a part of a bigger ship, but then noticed on the box that it really was just a couple pieces of LEGOS that &#34;kind of&#34; looked like a ship with the graphics on the box.  He is so bored that he doesn't even play with what he put together.  I am hoping the Darth Maul Santa will cheer him up.  I also hope that LEGO rethinks the calendars for next year.  For $40-50, I expect A LOT more and so does their number one fan!

B007SGLZP8|1.0|I really don't have much to say about this book. Thinking back I really don't know why I finished it. Almost nothing at all happens in it. It could easily have been written as a short story.<br /><br />The narrative is way too slow and at times it hardly feels as a narrative. The first person story telling doesn't work. The main character does not trigger any emotions. In honesty the only emotions I felt during the read came during the descriptions of the main characters female companion during the end of this long and boring read.<br /><br />I honestly feel like I wasted money and time on this book. Perhaps the author will refund me ? Pity I can't get the wasted time back, could have used it to read a better book.<br /><br />Strongly advice against purchase !

This book offered some VERY interesting insights into the power of statistical analysis without being 'geeky.'  Perhaps the most important point in the book is the idea that, though statistics can be used to justify nearly anything, the people who are best able to use statistics are those who have the WISDOM and EXPERIENCE to know the limits of statistics and 'big data.'  Written in an easy-to-read, non-condescensional style, the author is obviously brilliant and successful without coming across as arrogant...a real balancing act.<br /><br />Perhaps the best sections deal with the political prognosticators, weather men, Wall Streeters, and other professional 'forecasters' who have gigantic economic incentives to skew their predictions.  Great stuff to know.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|I am shocked and VERY upset at the poor quality of the vinyl in my box set. I have returned 6, that's SIX defective discs from the 16 disc set. Example, the song \\"Hey Bulldog\\" on The Yellow Submarine had a skip in the intro. Also excessive noise throughout making it unlistenable. I received a replacement album with no noise, but a skip in the exact same place! I pre-ordered my box set, a month later I am still waiting for half of it. Loud distortions on drum hits in Hey Jude, Surface noise on Revolver and the White Album. Unfixable even with professional vacuum LP cleaning machines.<br /><br />By comparison, the new Sundazed release of the Ventures catalog sounds and plays FANTASTIC! So do the Four Men with Beards releases of the Miles Davis Catalog. Proving that well manufactured modern vinyl can be dependable and sound INCREDIBLE! EMI has dropped the ball so far on these Beatles pressings they will never recover lost loyalty from MANY of us. I will NOT trust or buy next year's Mono releases.<br /><br />As far as the remasters to vinyl? You will hear things you never noticed before. The digital transfer is well done, but the \\"warmth\\" you hear is from EQ and nice AD/DA converters. They sound very good, but lack the immediacy of the best analog examples. My Japanese Red Wax sounds much more \\"real\\" and punchy. I have a white vinyl 1980's British version of the White Album that's way more fun to listen to. MoFi too. People new to vinyl will be blown away by these remasters if they can get an LP that actually plays. Collectors will count these as a novelty. Nice to hear another version of mastering and fine detail, but in the end not as satisfying as the original pressings. By the way, I still own my 1967 copy of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" that was the first LP I ever bought (age 10). It still plays better than half these EMI back alley cheap no quality control fly by night pieces of junk pressings do. And I'm being generous.<br /><br />Please let me know if you know how to complain directly to EMI. They need a spanking and to bed with no dinner.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|We all enjoyed the book....We really liked the historical factor and Phillipa Gregory's style of writing and use of characters was very exciting.....I've read other books by her and will continue as I haven't been disappointed.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson anyway so this purchase was a no-brainer for me. The new songs included are awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story! It was very imaginative in the plot. It keeps you entertained throughout the whole book, wanting to read more.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Do not have your kids watch it.  I don't even think I would let my 16 year old see it.  Definitely funny and for adults only.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i disliked that i had to wait for months to get this in 3d. i have 2 3d tvs and the graphics<br />are amazing luv it luv it
B00AC4BDY6|5.0|This is the BEST R&Fn'R that I have heard in many, many years. It's RAW and HONEST... it's sweet...<br /><br />  Thank You,Slash, Thank You,Myles, Thank You,Todd, Thank You,Brett.....<br /><br />  ;)...Singing and Dancing... ;)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Quite an imagination but made for great reading and the ending was more than I expected. I'll be reading more of his lex Cross books
B00A993UWM|5.0|I didn't expect such a good album from Ke$ha but she blew me away! This album is really fun but it can be really sweet its just all around awesome
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great job describing a distant and foreign land. The storyline is gripping with twists and turns through out. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story kept me interested.  Jacob seemed  very real as a teenager.  The father and mother at times did not strike me as authentic, but only sporadically.  A good Read.
0893815187|4.0|love this book and have wanted it for years. So glad I finally got around to ordering it for myself for Christmas. The photos are just so haunting and perfect, not intrusive or private.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Though it has been said, for good reason, that Led Zeppelin can never be as good without John Bonham, who happens to be the best rock drummer of all time, this is surprisingly good and satisfying even for the most hardcore Zep fan. It shows a slightly modernized, tighter approach to their incredible material, yet still stays true to the Zeppelin magic. This is because genius producer/guitarist/songwriter/showman/sonic wizard Jimmy Page is still their leader, with the unbeatable John Paul Jones back in the fold, along with the legendary Plant. Page really knows what he is doing...although grey haired and now pushing 70, he plays like a demon, check out the killer versions of No Quarter, For Your Life, Kashmir, Trampled Underfoot, and The Song Remains The Same. John Paul Jones is beyond amazing and shows why he is the best bassist in rock history, while being equally great on keyboards and bass pedals, the guy is like an octopus. He even plays a custom Manson 10 string bass on Nobody's Fault But Mine. Robert Plant sounds incredible, all this nonsense that he can't sing anymore is just that, total nonsense, as one listen to this version of Kashmir clearly shows. Jason Bonham does a great job, even considering the pressure on him. The whole package kicks all other live music DVD's to the trash. This thing is incredible, and puts their peers, as well as young bands, to absolute shame, as Led Zeppelin always have. Total class act. Buy it!
B0073RQMBY|3.0|Velociraptor was a small theropod Dinosaur that Lived during the late Cretaceous in Mongolia. It had a pointed snout, and is believed to be feathered due to quill knobs that were found on the arms of one specimen, and full coverings on the body's of its relatives.  Despite these facts, Schleich did what too many company's have done, and based there model on the Scaly outdated creatures raptors from the Jurassic Park franchise of movies. That would be fine and dandy, if Schleich did not say that this model is historically accurate on the Amazon page for this model.<br /><br />The model looks nothing like what the real Velociraptor may of looked like, and it shows signs of a lazy attempt to be accurate on the arms.  If This animal was feathered in real life (and there is evidence that shows that it was) It would have a complete covering. Also the head is  not that of a Velociraptor. Instead its that of Deinonychus, which in turn goes back to the fact that this is based on the JP Raptors which were based on that species of theropod Dinosaur.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a good replica of a Velociraptor for the reasons I stated
B00622BF40|5.0|Lots of fun :)  It has been a favorite in our house for many years.  I still remember the first time I saw it and loved it--it is slightly over-the-top in many places but that is just part of the fun
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What a great set to have in a Harry Potter collection.  We've watched these movies over and over  and over.
B0091LS07E|5.0|When I first played the CD I wasn't impressed and just said it wasn't good. Then I realized that I was playing it while doing other things. So the next day I put on my headphones and played the whole CD with no distractions. WOW! This thing is smoking hot. Better than her last CD and more solid. I am so glad I gave it another shot. I usually don't judge a CD with just one play and I almost broke my own rules.  Don't send it back just listen to it and it will change your mind.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as book one but still kept me interested the entire time. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie as well.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Yes its a left right jumping game, but the music is fun and the game play is a challenge as far as getting all the requirements go... You know, some people are too critical of the free app of the day, I mean if it sucks, OK, but this one is a good one, lets keep it above 4 stars! :)
B0083TU61S|5.0|I purchase this book for everyone that I know who is having a boy. This is such a great story and it makes a great baby shower gift.
1466401885|5.0|Absolutely could not put this book down, I was drawn in with all the tension and cant wait for walking disaster to come out next year.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I am 69 years old and this tells me I am 49 years old!!!  Love it and think it will be great fun for a party!
B005DOKM9M|1.0|Just not the quality for the price.  Also wrong size for the item I was going to use it with.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I must admit, the book sucked me in after the first few pages. I loved the characters and the depth of each.<br />I can't wait for Tower Lord to come out. It's on my short short list to grab as soon as it's available.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|A Christmas Carol is a classic book and a timeless story  and one that everyone should read at least once even if you have seen various versions of it on film.  I bought this for my Kindle Fire and read it along with my son. He had to read it for a school report.  It was great having an extra copy to read along with him and his book  didn't have the lovely illustrations that mine had.  I was able to share those with him as we went along and they added to the story.  All in all a wonderful story that still holds true for today's world and highly recommended.
0374531943|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book—Michael Collins did a wonderful job writing it. He includes many interesting details about the Apollo program that none of the other &#34;astronaut books&#34; do, and his innate intelligence & way with words makes it a very informative, very entertaining book. If you have any interest in the space race, or want some additional insight into what America was like at its zenith, this is a fun way to learn a bit about both. Of course I have never met Michael Collins, but after reading this book, I feel like his intelligence and his apparent tendency to think about things deeply without taking himself too seriously, provides a unique, valuable & entertaining take on the Apollo program, America, & humanity itself. Definitely worth the read.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Anti-war, anti-the-war-on-terror, and USA propaganda all at the same time. Made me ask myself big questions and find my own answers- great show.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This is one of the greatest movie's that was made from those fast and the furious type movies!!!!! I will be looking to put this movie on my IPad next.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Had to read it again straight away. I loved every page. Have now read it four times and still want to read it again.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie shows that there is a lot about Batman that I didn't know and I really enjoyed watching it a lot. I will be putting this on my IPad so that I can watch it at work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read all three books in less than a week...Excellent storyteller!  thoroughly enjoyed the series.  Would highly recommend reading this series.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I was never a comic book buff but I really can get into movie's of this type. I'm really looking foward in purchasing more movies like this from now on!!!!!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|This is the DVD the one on top is the CD. Again CD or DVD both, great to have.  And the CD with all those latinamerican great singers all of them , it just such a treat, songs that will bring memories to anyone who has embraced music, who loves jazz, I just can't believe I would enjoy this so much, and I do have all his CD's, records, cassettes, etc.<br />This CD is just amazing, could not help remembering all those beautiful songs, associating them with so many good memories of my life. It  was a really amazing, Xmas treat I gave myself
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Very entertaining movie. All characters are perfect. Kenneth Branagh is fantastic as Laurence Olivier and Michelle Williams is simply perfect as Marilyn!!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|my father loves this show now he can watch it whenever he'd like great Christmas gift for mature adults :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is a startling volume, it really makes you think: what IF Kennedy hadn't been assassinated?  What would our world be like today?  Would it be better, or worse as the book portrays?  Prepare yourself for an unsettling, sometimes vicious ride on one of King's well thought out and researched story lines.  I have to admit, I had to skip over a few pages, one thing my mind cannot handle is abuse and torture of animals, so gentle souls, be forewarned.  Overall, an excellent read.
B00003CX9W|5.0|From Stokowski to Mickey Mouse, from the Toccota and Fugue in D Minor, the Nutcracker Suite. The Pastoral Symphony, to Ave Maria the music is classic.  From the age 10 to 100, everyone needs to watch and listen to this film.
B0000541B2|5.0|OEM for the PS2, exactly what you would expect.  Fine functioning controller with tactile sensations, perfect replacement for an old, worn out controller.
B0086213XW|5.0|There are so many bad movies out there . So many that I almost get disappointed in watching movies anymore . But then I see a movie like this . That draws you in . That's real. And gritty. And it takes you to another place in someone else world for just a little while . I was pleasantly surprised with this movie . The acting was perfect . The story real and sad and sweet. Michelle Williams is one of this generations best actors !
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great movie.i watched it over and over. I would recommend to anyone. def get entire series and watch to get full history
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a fabulous ending--a must read. This is one of Grisham's best. A great story with everything the title suggests.
B002HC67U6|5.0|Great performance by Pacino. Very enjoyable and humorous movie to watch with a significant other. I highly recommend this movie.
0385536828|1.0|I usually like Ian McEwan's work but this one has a surprise ending that's very disappointing and leaves a bitter feeling.  I won't ruin the surprise but, looking back, he places hints in the text of what \\"some\\" writers might do--without any suggestion he would stoop to such trickery. I was reading this on my ipad, was not paying attention to where the end was, and was suddenly upended by the abrupt--and in my opinion intellectually unfair--ending. You have been warned!
B000SW4DXK|5.0|A classic and a must see. Great movie to see with your kids or grandkids. I would recommend this to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A colleague at work showed this game to me.  I thought nothing of it until I played it.  What a challenge to do more work and less Flow Free.
B0001I561E|5.0|A classic we never get tired of.  Kids of all ages enjoy it.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Makes a great gift.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can only load a few items from my news feed which really negates the purpose of having the app on my Kindle Fire HD. There are many other reviews with the same issue so you would think that it would be fixed by now.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|I was surprised that this movie was better than its title implied. Kurt has always been a very good actor, but it is easy to see that here he shines despite the very few lines he was given. The story itself was a surprise that it was not polished and it was a surprise to see that Todd, as a soldier did not make any smooth transition from his old life into a new one as easily as is too often portrayed in films. Todd, as a soldier, having known no other life was showing the stresses of what real soldiers have to deal with in such transitions when their training fails them in adapting to new situations. Alone, he could have survived, but amongst the refugees by whom he was befriended, he found it hard to live as he could not so readily adapt to their ways, so unlike his own, dredging up feelings long dormant and purposefully buried in his old life. However, when the action returned, one could see he burned with a new resolve as he returned to his old life to protect the people who took him in and to prove once and for all who was really &#34;obsolete.&#34;<br />Busey was excellent as an old line officer who still had feelings for his men and Issacs was best as the one who viewed his new line soldiers as just commodities, machines to serve a purpose while placing himself above them.<br />While this was a science fiction setting, it could almost relate to almost any other time as well.
1594135592|1.0|I can't force myself to finish this. I thought perhaps it would be an interesting look at a world with the survival of Prssident Kennedy.  The story of a man crawling through a canned goods storeroom to get back in time is too ridiculous and so unnecessary. I only bought it because my book club chose it but I can't do it.  Tempted by books I really want to read.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is amazing!  It is heartfelt and funny.  I love how the writers will bring something up in season one and then it gets explained a season or two later.  &#34;But that's a story for another day.&#34; :)
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|it is a fun game and it is very cute but it keeps freezeing on me and all these adds keep loping up out of nowhere.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the movie. Sparks writes in his usual simplistic style that makes reading his book easy and hard to put down. The characters are well defined with both mystery and anticipation paving the way to another great story of love, romance and perseverance.  This is a must read for fans of romance and Nicholas Sparks.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have loved The Piano Guys from day 1. I have listened to Jon, Steve and now, The Piano Guys for practically every day for the last two years and I still love hearing it. Code Name Vivaldi is my favorite. They need to do a Christmas CD. I love it!
B00A3OT34M|5.0|Pit does it again! The album has remixes and samples from tracks everybody knows from back in the day.couple that with his unique Miami sound and guest artist like Jennifer Lopez,Christina Aguilara ,Afrojack and you cant lose.Global Warming is heating up the charts so dress accordingly.
0061730335|3.0|This book left me unsatisfied.  It did not tell enough about the main character, a curious young man with an imagination, and I read it and thought that there must be much more to this story.  I am sorry it was not there.
B0019IMVDG|3.0|The movie had an excellent idea for a plot.  Frank Rosenthal is one of my personal favorite historical figures,  However, the excessive use of the f-word and the continual graphic violence added nothing to the movie.  Would have preferred to see much less graphic violence and less use of the f-word.  The movie also could have been shortened.  three hours was extremely long.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This film keeps you on the edge all through the series.  You catch yourself talking to the TV like they can hear you.  This film makes you think and wonder if this is not happening as we are watching it.  Great film and I look forward to the next one he writes.
B000PAAH3K|3.0|I read Blink because Outliers by the same author was so intriguing.  By comparison, Blink was disappointing, but I did learn from reading it.
B002RHL8DC|1.0|I didn't even make it through the 1st season. None of the characters are likable. Everybody spends their time whining, being emotional or out of control. We are subjected to Hollywood stereotypes of a totally undisciplined military contingent, the angry black soldier who rebels against authority, the psycho white soldier who attacks anybody without provocation, the slut who has sex with all the soldiers, the Asian lesbian, the weak commander who is preoccupied with getting home to his cheating wife, the immature useless mouthy 'genius' who can't reason his way out of a wet paper bag and the weird scientist type who has his own mysterious agenda. After a couple episodes, I really could care less what happened to them.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Very good funny, predictable but interesting. Good for the whole family. Would recommend for anyone of any age. Both actors are great.
B008K4JDLA|5.0|Clear and exciting book about the revolution we're about to live.<br /><br />Chris is already an expert on the subject and will guide you through what's happening right now.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This isn't really my style of game, therefore the reason for my lower rating.  I think younger persons are more interested in this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this series, I had read these books over and over and they never get old. It's a must read
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Brandon Sanderson is a terrific writer. He is arguably the best living fantasy writer. As with all of his novels, Emperor's Soul presents a world with a unique form of magic. Furthermore, the story is incredibly interesting and flows well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although I am a believer in Heaven and the &#34;after-life&#34;, it is wonderful to read about an actual NDE.  Dr. Alexander's experience was particulary inspiring because of his personal history leading up to his horrific illness.
B006JTS5WQ|5.0|This was hands down my favorite movie of the year! As soon as it came out on video, my wife and I grabbed it for our collection, which is saved for only the best movies that we see. The musical numbers are fun and catchy, and you will love that they are stuck in your head all day. Furthermore, the movie reminds you of what we have lost since Jim Henson passed away. This movie is a must if you have kids and want something fun and wholesome that does not rely on fart jokes to make kids laugh.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|If you like the humor from the original movies you will probably like it, if the first three didn't make you laugh this probably wont either. I got a good laugh out of it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|As I read Harold Fry,I was reminded of one of my favorite books by Elizabeth Berg, The Pull of the Moon where a woman unexpectedly gets in her car and goes.  In this book Harold Fry, a 65 year old retiree receives a letter from a dying friend and without premeditation he embarks on a walk across England more than 500 miles.  He intends to walk to her hospice hoping she will not die before he gets there.  He puts one foot in front of the other and onward he goes on a journey that reveals to be about more than his dying friend Queenie. I loved this book and felt my heart break as Harold's journey turns out to be a reflection of his life and \\"the anguish about things that can not be undone\\". Harold is an extremely likable and sympathetic character and his journey is inspirational.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|I almost passed this one over but decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. The lackluster screenshots don't do the graphics justice, the game looks beautiful on an HD screen. Gameplay is fun and I thought it was pretty clever to track jumps instead of time--you'll be playing each level many times trying to beat your best run.
B00AI7G2YS|5.0|I have been a \\"graphic note taker\\"/Doodler for as long as I can remember.<br />One of my colleagues has attended several SXSW conferences.  He suggested I check out graphic facilitation (Sunni Brown and Ogilvy Notes) and sketchnotes (Mike Rohode).  I have been a big fan ever since.<br />I work in education and have been searching for a reference to support teacher workshops.  This book will serve that purpose.
0982743726|5.0|\\"The Bone Sword\\" gave me an uncompromising introduction to its protagonist, in classic fantasy style, with a violent altercation in a tavern. From there the story kept up the pace, building the injust society, complete with religious tyranny and setting the characters against the evils of the system.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fact that the magic of this world seemed tied to a spirituality, with characters interpreting magic as either divine or infernal. I also enjoyed that the antagonists were human, rather than a cliched \\"other\\" and that morality stayed central as a theme throughout the book. Malik is an especially rich character because his own morality is ambiguous or sullied, yet he remains likeable. He makes a strong hero, on the shoulders of whom the story hangs.<br /><br />Some great fight sequences as well, all in all \\"The Bone Sword\\" is a fine, exciting read for any fan of the genre.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I purchased this for my dad after seeing the commercials for it on TV.  My dad is a HUGE Stones fan.  He absolutely loved it!!!  This is a great buy and a must have for any Stones fan. It makes a great gift too.
B007WCJSWA|5.0|An album of  lyrical beauty - full of nuance , gorgeous vocals , and understated virtuosity . Some Funk, jagged Rock/ Jazz , and  ' World ' influences , which makes for a very good album !  Definitely has Mike Stern's unique voicings , and rhythmic shifts all over the place !!!
B0011905MW|1.0|This DVD is not working in the US DVD's systems. If you buy it in US I think the only way you can watch it in your computer.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|Its a classic disk, and any good collection has to have it.  I will bet that it makes you smile when you play it.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Love the material and arrangements. Mr. Fagen is a one of a kind artist. I think this is one of his best solo projects.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very well written by a favorite author; lots of wonderful WWII atmosphere so you could picture life during the  bombings.  Loved the family intrigue but on completion and looking back there were signals of the ending but were not so obvious during the initial read.  Recommend highly.
0307593525|5.0|My husband wanted to try this cook book after watching the movie. He loves to cook. It arrive quickly and was a good price. Thank you.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This was a fascinating story about Dr. Soong the father. His androids are his children as he see it. The story is awesome with many twist and answers to questions from the series. Thoroughly enjoyable. I will not say more and spoil the experience of reading it for yourself.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I may have given it 4 stars but the update for kindle came out about 3-4 days AFTER it came out on the iphone. Other than that, fun game!
0062082353|5.0|I haven't read the book page to page yet but it seems to be as advertised.  Received quickly and at a fair price.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I love this show, and now I get to watch it whenever I want!! Cant wait to jump back into Downton!!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This was the least expensive I could find this style of thermal compound, with silver.  The design of the applicator made using it easy and closing it for future use easier.  The new chip I used it on started to get hot during the first power on cycle.  We powered down after the temp rose way higher than it should be run at.  After waiting a minute and restarting, there were no problems and everything ran nice and cool.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wonderfully interesting!!!!!!!!! loved it loved it loved it makes me want to run barefoot! my favorite book in the entire word.
B001I189MQ|5.0|Choose the movie, pay the nearly unbeatable price and wait a few days.  The brand new disk arrives, plays (excellent movie!) and I didn't even have to leave the house.  Order a bunch and shipping is free, too.  Sweet!
B00866JL96|4.0|Zan Efron has really grown up from the High School Musicals but he is awesome in this movie. It's great to see how well he has turned out
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is a complicated character and I can't get enough of Vince Flynn's books about him.  I'm happy that they went back to present day with this one.  It was a page turner and I found it hard to put down until I finished it.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0063TX06I|5.0|This is an older CD of the Bee Gees but if you love the Bee Gees which I do you will truly enjoy this one too
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Emi urgently need to remove this set for the benefit of the music of the Beatles and their fans. From Please Please Me to Abbey Road the sound is loud, saturated, without fidelity, with serious flaws in the manufacture of vinyl. I detect that not only are the labels that are broken, even the edges of the discs contain burrs. Of course applying for a full refund of the product, hoping capitol stop distributing this garbage and switch manufacturer. Big difference in cd boxes, there is no comparison, but not in 24 bits, the sound is pure and quite warm. One of the virtues of mono and stereo boxes in 2009, is the balance of sound, without noise. The single box was manufactured in Japan, increasing product quality.<br />I hope EMI executives, take seriously the comments of those who buy the vinyl, and distribute a new batch of this, with a company with quality standards requiring such material. I hope the mono box does not fail like this. The Beatles fans want true quality material. The music of John, Paul, George and Ringo is pure gold. Minimizing manufacturing costs is a big mistake.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|This had a lot of her songs on this 2 CD, however there are several songs that I do not remember.
B0086449YA|5.0|it arrived well before the due date from Argentina :) good job<br />I like the Album and the price of course.
B005Z28M58|5.0|This is a sad day when there are no more desperate housewives on Sunday nights. I always looked forward to watching them but at least I can watch whenever I want since I have the season.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very fun. Very similar to the arcade game. Takes awhile to generate more coins but good game overall.
B00005JL0I|4.0|I know that this is the original casino royale but I really prefer the newer one with Daniel Craig in it.
B008NABUU8|5.0|I bought this for my grandchildren they love it they all will get to gather and see what they can build.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|This is an excellent movie and especially with Sean Connery. I received the DVD in less than a week. This is a typical 007 movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Don't waste your time or $ on this book. Continued reading just to see if it got better. Should have just trashed it and gave up.
B00684J49U|5.0|What can I say about this season other than you've gotta have it if you have the other seasons. They are always leaving you guessing on what is next to come.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This book did not disappoint! I get drawn in to the story and can't stop reading it.Definitely recommend this book
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I'm sure all the women out there know that this a great movie. Of course its not really a date night movie its more for the females or girls only night.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|i love this kindle. the only complaint i have is that the instruction are nearly non existent and what there is may as  well been written in chinese
B0084I9QI2|5.0|ONCE YOU START THIS DVD, YOU HAVE TO FINISH IT ALL, THEN YOU WILL SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN... THE MEN WAS INCREDIBLE.
B000M4RG42|1.0|I was surprised, Clint Eastwood work is generally good. Not this time. x x x x x x x x
B000AGTPUK|5.0|What an excellent movie this is! We loved it and it is definitely a movie I love to watch over and over...especially while drinking hot chocolate and eating candy canes!!!
145162445X|4.0|I really like Lawrence M. Krauss but this book is just a capitalist move to profit from the success of the lecture of the same name. Much better off just watching the lecture.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Well, I guess that we all have to get old some day, but Oh Lord, why Bobby and the boys?  Robert Plant has pretty much lost his voice.  Even sitting back, and listering with my eyes closed can't erase those many, many years of vocal abuse.<br /><br />On the other hand, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones still play like Aces.  Jason  Bonham is a very good drummer, but alas, from a differnt school than his late father, and you can hear it.<br /><br />This album sounds (and looks), like it was made by a bunch of guys who hadn't seen each other in years.  Even so, I'm glad to have bought the package.
B0025CS2GU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the first two movies were great but this looks like Mike Meyers kind of mailed this in. I mean really, with all the actresses out there he got Beyonce? (I wonder who they really wanted because I am thinking she was the second choice on this)<br />Basically, this movie just looked tired, Meyers looked bored and about the only thing they really managed to do was tie up the story between Dr Evil, Mini-me, Austin and his dad. And to think he followed this up with &#34;The Guru&#34;???<br />But I will give credit where credit is due, Meyers and the other players in the espionage game made the owners of 007 take notice and revamp their series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun but hard to win often. I wish the ads would go away! It's frustrating to have ads pop-up between each game.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Not really a tom Crusie fan at all. Never saw &#34;Top Gun&#34;, never saw &#34;Days of Thunder&#34; and barely sat through &#34;Valkyrie&#34; But i have enjoyed the Mission Impossible franchise from the get-go.<br />I will say this though, all the spy parodies, all the innuedo from other sources did make the people at Eon really look at Bond and reboot it to what it is today. (still say the best bond parody isn't really a movie, it's &#34;Our Man Bashir&#34; from Deep Space Nine and Andrew Robinson's masterfully played Garak's commentary on the sixties home decor)
B009O2XY12|4.0|I am addicted to this game. I just wish we could have more than 5 bars of energy for playing the levels.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Zombies, undead or just people with really bad skin conditions...who cares? the show is about the survivors and how they manage to get along in the post apocalyptic world. So many layers to the story. I don't have cable, but yet, i manage to fork 1.99 per episode for this show. Why? it's a good show!
0385738773|3.0|Well, who would have thought that I would actually last through the entire series.  The Maze Runner story is odd and does not provide definite answers even at the very end.  It's an OK trilogy and this last book isn't better or worse than the other two books.  At times I felt frustrated and thought about giving up but I needed to make it to the end and find out what in the world that WICKED group was about - was WICKED good?  At the end, I wasn't satisfied nor disappointed - I was just happy that the series was over.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Love the takes on Zombie genre these days. it seems that a lot of people were influenced by those 80's zombie movies and by the grand daddy of them all, George Romero's &#34;night of the living dead&#34; I always find it interesting what other culture's takes on our films seem to be.<br />Simon Pegg and his merry band of malcontents, misfits and ne'er do wells take the zombie genre and give it a wedgie, make it sit on a whoopee cushion, and add a wet willie to boot. How you not like this movie and it's use of Bill Nighy as a recently turned zombie and his stepfather?
B000YABS8E|5.0|This movie came in a timely manner, well packaged, and with no signs of defects. Great price, and a great movie. If you have seen this movie already, like I have, you probably got it for the same reason I did. This movie is awesome!!! :D:D<br /><br />If you have not seen this movie, I recommend it if you like silly goofy movies. It's not a newer movie, so I know for some people, older movies are harder to get into if it's your first time seeing them. :)<br /><br />I am a mother of 3, ages 4 and 2 year old (almost 3) twin boys. The boys laugh at some goofy parts of the movie, and my 4 year old girl sits next to me and watches some parts, but they don't sit still for the whole movie. :) The most they've watched with me is probably 30-45 minutes of it, and that's if I give them pop corn :D<br /><br />This is a great family movie to add to a collection, in my opinion.
0345803485|5.0|M and my boyfriend read this book together and had a great time reading it. I would suggest it to anyone
B00992CF6W|5.0|some people want to now how to update this app all you do is go 2where you bot this app that's it it updates otomaticly
B004GYY714|4.0|I really love being able to listen to my hometown radio stations.  The only thing I don't like is when my phone gets moved the station changes sometimes - don't know how to turn off the &#34;shake&#34; feature unless you lock your phone, which I sometimes forget to do.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I just read that John Carter was named as the top 10 list of the worst movies of the year. Having read the books as a kid, I was not dissipointed. I do not know what movie they were watching but I don't think it was the same one I saw. This is a great flic with all the elements of a classic Sci Fi movie. Thumbs way up from a Guy that actually pays to see movies.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In typical fashion,  the plot has many twists and turns with unexpected results. The characters are clearly defined and riveting. I read the book easily and quickly. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes suspense thrillers
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. Its very addicting and very good game for passing time. Difficult to put down and several of the more advanced levels are very challenging.
0316227706|5.0|This is an amazing book! I bought it for my mom for Christmas, but after looking through it im going to keep it for myself! Amazing photography! Amazon had it to me 2 days after i placed the order!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|One of the best dairy of a wimpy kid books ever comodey gold!!!!!<br />One of the best dairy s ever funny fun and new and<br />Real
B007RI56NY|5.0|Honestly i bought the album because it was a steal and then it became one of my favorites instantly. My favorite track was you can finally meet my mom.
B000002GB6|5.0|Nicely done album for quiet times, classic songs, exceptional horn, mellow mood and originals tunes done well and still wonderful listening.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I already knew I liked &#34;Mountain Song&#34; and &#34;Little Talks&#34; from hearing them on the radio, and now I've fallen in love with the entire album. I've listened through it from start to finish at least once at work each day since I bought it last week and so far I'm only finding new things to appreciate.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This a one of those movies that seems to work on many levels.  The story is quite ridiculous on one level but it deals in a very real way with the angst of children growing up.  The ongoing description of Purcel orchestral piece is surprising and pleasing, the acting  and directing are superb.  We have watched it several times in the DVD and the BlueRay.  The BlueRay version was hard to boot up for some reason.
B0094KT7CY|5.0|This is my favorite disney movie & in HD it was even more incredible! This is a great story for all ages.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Again it was not what I imagined.  I like Sparks cause he doesn't use profanity.  Books can be written without it.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|We watched it 3 times & we still laugh out loud :) I would recommend this to anyone who like adult humor or Family Guy!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Not at all what I expected; but I liked it. It's a quick read.This could happen Just like 'Agenda 21'
B008D28HYS|5.0|Very addicting and rewarding. Always the first game I play when in a situation with no internet. It's been updated multiple times with added puzzles which is great appreciated.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|My old DVD acquired feet but no matter as I now own this on blu-ray. A timeless classic and must see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No glitches at all - works great.  The only thing you have to put up with is the advertisement that opens every time you start a game, but some of those are good offers, so no problem at all having them.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Absolutely love it!!! Great and funny movie and awesome concert footaged- hard to believe they are still going strong after 20 years
B007IXWL2C|5.0|simply great. I enjoyed all three books and couldn't put them down. Hoping another trilogy comes out!<br /> Great, great read!
B006G7Y7GY|4.0|Fast shipper as discribed  like Ozzy even more now funny British humor great fast read laughed out load. . .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot keep my eyes away from it.  I cannot wait for February.  It keeps getting better and better.  I recommend everyone to watch it.
B00009RDGA|4.0|Fast shipper, as described . . Fast shipper, as described  Fast shipper, as described  &. ; Fast shipper, as described
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you're a Family Guy fan, this movie is a 'must see'. I hope McFarlane will have a follow-up movie in the future.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Fast shipper, great movie, as discribed able to watch in English without reading subtitles. . . . . . . .
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This was the first serious, realistic roll I've ever seen Shia Labeouf in. He's defiantly proven himself as an \\"all grown up\\" actor in this one. Well written, well acted. Loved this movie. Watched it on demand over the weekend, but  will defiantly be adding it to my library soon.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|It seems like it would be a great platform game I just don't have the patience to control a character that is constantly in motion.  The game play is direct and simple enough, It's just anlittle frustrating that every second you stop to think of your next move, its another jump counted against your score.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Awesome movie.... will always be great.  Tom Hanks is at his best as usual. Captures great events as they happened back then.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was great. Beautifully executed, well constructed story. Lots of naked male ass in it. More so than any Disney movie I've ever seen. I mean, there were asses everywhere, in like three scenes. Not that I'm complaining. I would be careful about watching this movie with children younger than 4. My two year old got freaked out by some of the action scenes, and couldn't sleep. She enjoyed it though, overall, because she likes strong female characters in movies. Personally, I really liked this one. Wouldn't mind watching it again, with the kid, when she's a little older. Or maybe during the day next time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it!<br />Recommended it to anyone.  It is addictive with plenty of play on the free tokens. Tokens regenerate quickly.
B00633W614|5.0|I enjoyed this next book in the Clifton Chronicles series and am anxiously awaiting the third book that is coming in May 2013.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|More of a recount of an experience then a scientific analysis, Proof of Heaven is an engaging read that gave me a greater understanding of our existence.<br /><br />The book is an account of Dr. Eben Alexander's near death experience.  He contracts a severe form of E. Coli meningitis and quickly falls into a coma.  During the coma he experiences a journey to a place of peace. It starts as cloudy place, which he calls the worm's eye view.  He then journeys to a sunny pasture land where he meets a lovely women who becomes his guide.  Finally he finds himself in a place that he describes as being in the middle of God himself.  After seven days in coma, Dr. Eben miraculously wakes up from his coma and fully recovers.<br /><br />Even though this book is not empirical scientific proof of the existence of heaven, his neurological explanations of the impossibility of his experience gives me hope that there really is more to this existence that our short time here on earth.  I would recommend this to anybody with an openness to the possibility of an existence of life after death.  If you completely don't believe in an afterlife, this book will most likely not help.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had it on my kindle and it was great. The books are addicting. I finished all three books in 3 weeks.
B0038W0OHQ|1.0|This is probably the worst gaming investment I had ever made.<br />I expended 150 dollars on this headset (considering taxes and those things) telling to myself \\"well for that price they should last a couple of years\\", well I was completely wrong. It happens that after 3 months without even detaching the pieces, not even taking them anywhere(and you should consider that they were made for traveling gamers)they started having problems on the right phone until it eventually died. So I strongly recommend you guys to skip this product and invest in other thing.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This was a very unusual movie for me.  It was certainly intriging and kept me on the edge of the seat.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good book for anyone who likes a little spice in their reading..... I kept looking around to make sure no one was around because I felt &#34;dirty&#34; reading these books LOL
0739378341|5.0|His characters come alive for me!  His description of time,place and people takes me into the story.  I totally<br />Loved Malcom Bannisters hide and seek escapades. And the twist surprise ending.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good book for anyone who likes a little spice in their reading..... I kept looking around to make sure no one was around because I felt &#34;dirty&#34; reading these books LOL
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This is one the best buddy films ever. It is a fun filled, laugh riot. If you are not smiling at the end, you might be dead inside.
B004UIXZV4|5.0|I read this years ago when in college but have used my French very little since, although I was once a fluent reader.  Deciding to brush up for an intended trip to Europe, I was happy to find this free Kindle version.  I looked for a good Kindle version French-English dictionary to accompany it but was not able to find one, only English-French; but on January 1, 2013, Collins is coming out with one that will sync with the Kindle, making it easy to translate words and idiomatic phrases.  C'est un fait accompli!  Reading A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu (usually translated as Remembrance of Things Past: of which this is just the first book) in its entirety, however, is a challenge (it took me nearly a year!) and a test to one's stamina if you're not a native or fluent speaker.  But it's worth the effort because Proust is one of the world's great, master writers whose innovative approach to writing a novel changed world literature.  I am a writer myself and I am convinced that reading and re-reading those long (but perfect) paragraphs in Proust's books helped shape me into a better writer. Remembrance of Things Past is much more than a book: it is a doorway, not just one through which we can enter to view the lives of its main characters, but one by which we can experience an entire community and culture from the past.<br /><br />If you get through Du Cote de Chez Swan, don't stop.  You can download Proust's entire novel for free with Amazon Prime on Kindle.  Check it out!<br /><br />MOD
B008RA3X5E|4.0|More colors and display types would be nice.  Also, a running countdown timer in addition to the time (smaller numbers) until the alarm goes off would be good.<br /><br />I like the ability to pick a wake up song from my library a lot!  How about allowing it to alarm to an internet radio station if wireless is on?
0307592731|5.0|I am an avid reader. I read approximately 40 books a year.<br />This was my best read for 2012.<br />Cheryl Strayed wrote, a so honest it hurts, memior. She comes to terms with the death of her mother and her divorce while she a  walks a grueling hike on the Pacific Trail. Not only does she discover her hidden strengths and learns to deal with weaknesses, she founds a core of steel within herself as she walks mile after mile and deals with hunger, cold, heat, filth, sore feet, people and wildlife. I couldn't put it down.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|A good plot but overall not something that I would watch again. Many elements in this film seem out of contexts of the plot. Basically a kid flick.
B002JVWR54|5.0|havnt seen this show since it was on, saw the price and had to pick it up. wheden fans rejoice
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|This was a good remake of the old movie with lots of futuristic/tech innovations that the old version did not have.. Would recommend it!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Bubbles Touch is a fun game and you have to use your brain to get the bubbles all off. It is fun and it makes you think.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I really love Whitney Houston and this holiday album is wonderful....I play it all the time at my desk:)  Thanks....
B0090P98Z4|5.0|if u like the diablo series check out this game you wont regret it...<br />could use a bit more features like more than 2player multiplayer but it is still worth checking out...
B000002A46|5.0|Wonderful music to work by.....or play by:)<br />I really likie Mariah Carey and have several of her CD's.<br />Worth the money
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This movie was very disappointing.  It had a great cast, good special effects, and an epic sci-Fi background with the connection to the Alien franchise.  In the end, it was doomed by a weak script and plot holes you could drive the Nostromo through.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Came in, been using it for a while now, solely for when playing a computer game on the ps3. I can hear players running around beside me and stuff. So far so good. Recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for bill paying and budget planning. I love the big screen and the fact that it shows the total and the last number entered.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|If you are a vintage Marvin Gaye fan then give this a listen. There is something very, very soothing to the old school 70's soulful sound on this CD. It is new music that sounds like it is from a bygone era. Great tunes that you will think about after you are done listening. Might be my favorite album of the year.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Nice graphics.  Okay game but not great.  It takes up a lot of time.  Not overyly exciting.  Do not hate the game, it is just okay.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Pitch Perfect is a hilarious movie with comedy and a little romance it is the perfect movie for people aged 12 and over and a great movie to go and watch with a friend.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Easy way to have fun and take up some time. This game does not require a lot of skill.  But makes you want to try to get to that next level.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you go to 4shared.com and make an account, you can get minecraft for the kindle fire for free, full version!And the latest! If you choose correctly,  you may find one that doesn't have much glitches!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really do like this game.  I like the idea of building up a restaurant.  However, it takes so much to get to certain levels.  I found myself wasting way to much time on this game.  I ended up deleting this game
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sharpening knives takes some commen senses and a little bit of time. Even though this is a sharpener that u can carry in your pocket or pack, and doesn't take a lot of room. Doesn't make it a fast sharpener at all. I think this sharpener works Well for the price. Just like using a stone or any other sharpeners you have to take time to get sharp. I guess some people just don't understand this or just suck at sharpening knives all together.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I did not want to put it down.  Although it was a novel that was rated as fiction, the author had carefully woven an authentic look at the history of the time when Sarah was living into the story.  There is much to be learned about the role the French played in the persecution of the Jews living in France in the early 1940's. I am looking forward to reading more books by Tatiana De Rosnay.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|this game is addicting and very fun the pony problem is after you unlock all the elements games over but utill them love it
037582913X|5.0|My grandmother read this book to me when I was a child and I liked it a lot.  Grover tries roping the pages together to keep you from flipping it, and tries to convince you not to turn the pages so you don't get to the monster. Not to spoil it -- I assume this is an adult audience -- but the monster at the end is Grover himself.<br /><br />If your child is five years-old or older, I recommend saying, &#34;Well, he says not to turn the page! I guess we can't finish!&#34; Then the child should turn the page anyway. It gave me the giggles when I was young, and my son likes that, too.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I am so glad to have this for my kids. the price is great I received it in a couple of days.  My kids will be thrilled
B002F6FQGK|4.0|Great CD!  She has a beautiful voice.  Great music to walk/exercise with.  I recommend it highly. I give it 4 stars
B000UVT3OI|5.0|The Ultimate Hits is great it's loaded with great songs and a DVD with alot of Garths Videos. I'd buy it again!
B003XDUCIG|4.0|Great book for a enthusiastic cook who has curiosity about why some things work and others don't as well as suggesting new ways of approaching certain cooking styles or new foods
B00A1C1DYE|5.0|I am having foot surgery, so this will keep me from walking for a few days...cant wait to curl up on the sofa
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Forward unto Dawn really surprised me.  Despite its low production value, it's a very good sci-fi movie.<br /><br />I would recommend rental to any sci-fi fan, regardless of their familiarity with the Halo universe.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have watched in a long time.  I can't get enough of it.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Modern day effects and computers have given film making a whole new level.  Avatar however couldn't of been made without it.  Love conquers all in a modern day version.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time.  I can't get enough of it.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|Series continues. This wraps up where it should end.  However Batman  always will be undefeated and back to save people of Gotham
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time.  I can't get enough of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's fun to watch the kids crowd around playing this game. Multiplayers can be engaged in this. It has survived 'shelving' other games. My grandkids must think it's a winner.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app its great for school I don't like getting up at 6:30 am but this helped me
B007M45PMU|4.0|Dont let amazons short snippet of the songs fool you this CD is actually pretty good. I first played the samples on here and they didnt sound well, then my friend got the CD and It was really good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app fun for adults. There is something for everyone! I like that you can earn games. Some apps make you purchase to get higher levels. The racing game is my favorite.
B0013IKUIK|4.0|This is a great CD he has a really good beat and i like the style of his music. I would recommend this to someone who likes slower and mellow music.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|One of my favorite anime's. Seen this a long time ago when I was younger and could hardly remember anything other than it was good. Definitly glad I bought it again. Great storyline along with graphic fight scenes.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham's novel are an easy fast read.  Litigators held my interest and had a little different take on his typical lawyer's tale.  I always enjoy his books.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Better than was expecting the story the plot everything about this movie is good . Hope we get a 4 one
B0007GAEGC|5.0|great musical composition great cast and singers. Their music is always beautiful, uplifting and romantic, and energizing.  This is one of my favorite albums and sing groups.
0307742539|5.0|I've really never enjoyed reading very much, so a book has to really work for my attention. Even more so if there are movie adaptations out there, and multiple books in a series. I read the first book of the trilogy before the american movie came out, enjoyed it just a bit more than the movie. Finally decided to pick up the second book, burned through it in a week. Could not wait to get my hands on the 3rd, I haven't put it down but only to write this review. May Mr. Larsson rest in peace knowing full well he wrote a fantastically great story. You need to read these.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This was my 1st experience with Leonard Cohen and I loved it.  He is an amazing songwriter,singer,musician.  Thanks.<br />Leonard Cohen  Live In London.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Like so many others, the heatsink/fan that shipped with my i7 had it's plastic pegs snap. Since it couldn't maintain good contact with the CPU, I started experiencing random shut downs of my computer. This CPU cooler was cheap and it works great! It bolts onto the motherboard, ensuring a secure fit.<br /><br />It is shockingly bulky when you unpack it, but it worked great on my Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD3R Rev 2.0 motherboard sitting inside of an Antec Three Hundred ATX case.<br /><br />Highly recommended for my purposes. I do not overclock though, so I can't comment on its performance other than as a replacement for the stock cooler.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, Vince Flynn comes through with his no nonsense character, Mitch Rapp. If only he were around during our screwball elections and straighten some of these Washington idiots out. The only negative, for me, was the FBO nerd that wanted to interfere in things; I suppose that might happen, but I doubt in the way portrayed here. Highly recommended read, however. Is there ever going to be a Mitch Rapp movie?
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Presently the Catholic Church requires its clerics to be celibate.  But, that was not always the case.<br /><br />The Borgias is a story about a conniving ruthless Spanish family in Rome.  The head of which, Rodrigo, bribes, cheats and murders his way to become the Pope of Rome.<br /><br />There is nothing religious about this series.  All the Cardinals have families or mistresses.  The Pope has four children. He creates one Cardinal, one general of the Papal Armies and marries two off to cement alliances that will keep him in the papacy.<br /><br />He is despicable to everyone but himself.<br /><br />We are introduced to his daughter Lucrezia.  Lucrezia's family later came to epitomize the ruthless Machiavellian politics and sexual corruption alleged to be characteristic of the Renaissance Papacy.<br /><br />All the cast is here.  I can't wait to see how each develops in Season II.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I havent read it all yet. so far its great. Have always loved Patricia Cornwell books.will let you know when finished.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Used this processor in a small &#34;second&#34; PC.  With the included graphics capability, coupled with a SSD boot drive, it has an excellent &#34;bang for the buck&#34; ratio
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book was slow reading in the begining.  Surprise ending.  The beginning was kind of slow, but became more interesting half way through it.
B00A23MYCC|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I couldnt make it through half the movie before I needed to make a life and death choice between finishing it or jumping off a bridge! Not one funny line o moment.
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|I was dissappointed. The game was fun, but, you have to pruchase another game in order to solve the first one??
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book would get you hooked especially to those who are introverts! Why? Because it feels like the author is talking directly to you, not just any other readers or extroverts but just YOU (if you suspect yourself as an introvert)!!<br /><br />There are only 20% of introverts in population (same percentage in the animal kingdom) and 70% of them are highly sensitive: So I am one of those sensitive introverts or 14% of population!<br /><br />The other most shocking insight I got was the experiment the scientists did in 2004 to see whether volunteers- with FMRI scans monitoring their brain activities - would conform to the crowd decisions when answering simple questions.<br /><br />The difficulty of the normal questions is shown by the error rate, which initially is 14% and this is before involving the crowd. When everyone in class deliberately answer incorrectly on most of the questions, the volunteer's error rates jumped to more than 40%.<br /><br />Checking the different brain activities of the volunteers, the scientists deduced that many more answers had become incorrect not because they were pressurized by the crowd and consciously gave the incorrect answers so that they wouldn't stand out; but they were misled subconsciously by peer pressure despite their initial doubts, and they really thought the incorrect ones were the correct answers!<br />This has enormous implications because it means that any group decisions in government or firms would all have this group dynamics: where even though someone who should be qualified to say no to a bad unanimous group decision, would still be misled into making bad decision subconsciously and follow the crowd!<br /> i.e  Your objectivity are partially impaired when you potentially have a different opinion than the crowd!<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book as it had brought back a lot of memories and solved a lot of mysteries of why I was so different compared to others, especially in boarding school back then.<br /><br />Thank you very much for writing such a wonderful book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Absolutely spell binding....learned so much, cried a lot, worried a lot.  Read this whole book to my husband back and forth several times to the doctors. My husband is also a Veteran of whom I have a great deal of respect for. We loved every word that was written and just finished it...wish we could find out where these patriots are now in their lives. Absolutely wonderful!!!!!
1400067820|5.0|Like his previous book, there are many extremely unique insights and with so many topics mashed into a single book; it is pretty normal to read the book two or three times (like I did with the Black Swan) in order to fully appreciate the depth of the author's knowledge and the wisdom of the ancients.<br /><br />However, like many reviewers, I too think the author should submit his essays for editing: there are parts that are dryer than usual.<br /><br />So to make it more readable and for the 2nd edition of the book, he should add more satirical jokes or funny thought experiments that lighten the mood (esp. for sub book IV?)<br /><br />The idea of iatrogenics (or harmful side effects from receiving treatments) is interesting (In Chinese Medicine, there's a saying,\\"medicine carries 30% of poison\\")<br />Other key insights include Stoicism, skin in the game, and many useful heuristics. In fact, we could \\"platonize\\" his key insights into useful checklists!<br /><br />In sum, It's a great read epecially towards the end, and it's fun reading his rants against famous authors/scholars though there are places where I feel pity and a bit unfair to scholars like Mr Stiglitz who in March 2002 (on page 478) published a paper saying that Fannie Mae 's new risk based capital standard:<br /><br />\\"ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero\\"<br /><br />Is this statement really completely wrong? is the author not subjected to hindsight bias?  At least 9 months later ,the author in chapter 19 wrote a journalist from NY Times came to him sometime in 2003 concerning about the Fannie Mae problems; Then he wrote \\"if he (Stiglitz) were a businessman, he would be wiped out and exited the gene pool\\"<br />That sounds way too harsh and affirmative. I would say the author suffers from overconfidence (in the same way as Stiglitz for his 2002 paper) to assert such an outrageous statement.<br /><br />Does a businessman, if Dr Stiglitz were one, have no optionality to get rid of his exposure or simply sell his stakes when facts and conditions change? Is it fair to insinuate that Dr Stiglitz or all investors back in 2002 would be stupid enough, after conditions obviously had changed by say 2005, to stick with Fannie Mae until it was bailed out?<br /><br />I think you could only argue Dr Stiglitz was overconfident about his assessments but we never knew back then in March 2002 that Alan Greenspan would maintain interest rates at such a low level for so long, and the author only realised the problem sometime in 2003.<br /><br />Talab is correct that Dr Stiglitz didn't see himself potentially as being the Turkey, but everyone makes mistakes based on what information they have, and I presume if Dr Stiglitz were the businessman, he would be like Warren Buffett who mistakenly bought Gen Re and had to sell all those derivatives contracts to reduce exposure.<br /><br />So despite loving the author's work, I would advise him to be a bit more humble and shouldn't assume the \\"smartest of economist\\" to be the most stupid investor or businessman: buy and hold or not change course towards the end even when there were so many new evidences against his initial position like housing bubble and ninja loans etc.<br />This is completely the opposite of the Turkey's confidence being maximum based on historical evidence of being fed daily, right before the chef cooks it.<br /><br />To conclude, it is slightly cheap to attack an economist who he too respects in order to become infamous with assumptions that are unlikely to be true.<br /><br />However his main point \\"Joseph Stiglitz problem\\" might be  true:  \\"Mental cherry-picking, leading to contributing to the cause of a crisis while being convinced of the opposite-and thinking he predicted it\\" (pg. 432)<br />And with his super intelligence, the author probably knows his statement \\"exit the gene pool\\" being too harsh - the attacks are probably a ploy togain controversy deliberately to promote his book !! (he actually explained that the more criticisms the author received, the greater the sales!!)  So I am helping the author to sell his book!!<br /><br />Anyway, whether you agree or not, readers should be grateful for having such thought provoking wonderful book available !<br />the glossary, appendix and notes (about 50 pages) have some more interesting and technical discussions.<br /><br />Thank you very much for writing such amazing book!  Looking forward to the expanded version of Anti fragility in the near future with more satirical jokes and funny thought experiments in between the dry parts!

B003AVPV1O|1.0|I bought this with the intention of connecting both my computer monitor and my flat screen tv to my computer.  We like to connect the tv to the computer to watch online videos on the bigger screen, but switching the monitor cable back and forth between the monitor and the tv is a pain.  Some other reviews indicated that other people had done this very thing with this cable.  However, when I connected this cable to my devices, it would only work with the computer monitor as long as the tv was NOT connected, and would not work with the tv at all, period.<br /><br />If you are looking to connect both a monitor and tv to your computer, buy a different splitter.<br /><br />When I contacted the seller to ask about returning the cable, they asked me to ship the cable back to them.  After a second inquiry, they reluctantly provided me with a return shipping label.  They did not acknowledge receiving the return until I contacted them to ask why they still had not issued a refund.  They again asked me to ship it back to them, despite the fact that the tracking number on the package indicated that it had been in their possession for more than a week. I still had to file a complaint with Amazon before I was able to get a refund.
B008I34ZFW|2.0|I'm a sucker for campy B-movies.  I had high hopes that Iron Sky would be B with a capital B.  It was a little too well made to be a true B-movie.  But it wasn't good enough for an A rating either.  The story line had great potential but didn't really deliver.  The acting was ok.  I did enjoy the demagoguery of the American Powers That Be.  Still, I wouldn't buy it again if given the option.  Rent it for $2 and enjoy it.
B004RGHWIQ|1.0|I have no idea who this disc is designed for.  It does not support 3D on modern 3D TV (polarized or shutter glasses). It supports only anaglyph 3D (red/blue).  this item should not be sold as labeled.
B001Y8WAJ6|4.0|I've been a Saxon fan - really the first seven albums - since about 1981.  It is refreshing to listen to vocals and music that retain the realism of music that hasn't been polished to the point of unrecognizability.  I was thrilled to find CD replacements for my vinyl and cassettes. (Those were the things on which old-timers listened to music, they weren't even digital).  The Crusader Prelude, with its battle cry's, charging horses, and clashing armor still gets the blood pumping in time for the crash of the opening bars of Crusader.  This is meant to be listened to at high volumes with the windows rolled down.  A good subwoofer will save your speakers.  I do fancy this one, more than a little bit.
B001KTYOWK|5.0|This man writes with a flair and a great sense of humor.  I first read this book when I was 12 years old and have read everything else he has written and even seen him speak in person.  I highly recommend this book-I rolled on the floor laughing the first time I read about the scorpians being dumped onto the dining table.

That said, I hate that this imagined visual would sneak into my mind while reading more Reacher stories.
0321701763|4.0|I finished this book in a little over a week doing 2-3 lessons a day and it is a decent book for beginners. I had no Photoshop experience before and the book has taught me well. I have been editing my pictures with ease and learned lots of cool things that photoshop offers. For a more in depth look at photoshop, you will need other books because this one just scratches the surface of the software.

B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great family movie about the story of Rapunzel... The only thing that I would warn potential parent buyers about is the slight &#34;witchy&#34; feel that you get regarding the &#34;magical sun flower&#34; and the song used to unlock it's magical healing powers, but in my opinion, it's no worse than Cinderella.

B007THA4FI|2.0|What is up with europeans being so dark?<br />Don't get me wrong. love the harry potter series.  Couldn't get<br />enough of it or her.<br />Was so looking forward to reading this.  Seemed like a strange<br />plot but its J.K. so I thought couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />Seems very politically driven.  Haves verses the have nots.<br />I know she is very concerned about<br />children and their safety and lifestyle but wowza!<br /><br />I just would've titled this different and let people know what to expect.<br /><br />I hope some of the money she makes off of this book goes to her<br />charities too.  Then I won't feel so bad about reading such a dark<br />book when all I wanted to do was be entertained.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I've been watching Blu-Ray films on my PS3 for several years now, and I figure I have a pretty good eye for quality transfers.  This is one.  The initial few scenes are a bit grainy, but I think it was due to the limitations of shooting from a portable camera from a helicopter in 1959.  I'll forgive the grain.  But once the scenes move to the amazing expanses of the Austrian countryside I was blown away.  The clarity is phenomenal.  Even sparkles on the water were vivid.  Plus, the sound is amazing as well.  Bravo on the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Of note:  this set apparently did not generate as much interest initially so the price has dropped.  I picked it up in the gold box for $18.99.  I have noted the contents and whether they are worthy:<br />4 disc collection: film on Blu-Ray with some features (including a sing along version!), another Blu-Ray of special features, the DVD film version, and a CD soundtrack.<br /><br />The music box plays \\"My Favorite Things\\" but it plays a bit fast.  It is small-ish, maybe 3\\" x 2\\" x 2\\" or so.  But it has space for some rings or a locket or some other 'favorite thing'.  It says hand painted, but it looks like it was painted from a stencil.  It is a stoneware style, so that is nice.<br /><br />The two books are the great additions to the set.  They have a special feature book (soft cover) and then a production bio (hardcover).<br /><br />The last things are a certificate of authenticity and some post cards.<br /><br />The entire set comes in a stiff cardboard box with a cardboard sleeve around it.  You can remove the sleeve (which has a couple of small pictures showing the contents) and the inner box is clean and looks like the picture.<br /><br />All in all a great set for fans of the film.  For under $20 it is one of the best finds I stumbled across this holiday season.  Even at $30 it is worthy.  If you don't care for the extras, there is a Blu-Ray special edition that is basically the movie with the 3 discs (not including soundtrack): [[ASIN:B003VS0CX8 The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]].  I recommend the boxed set for fans or as a gift, but the other version is great for those who just want to enjoy the film.<br /><br />One of the truly remarkable films on Blu-Ray to this date.  Simply marvelous, epic, and breathtaking.  Now I'm buying Lawrence of Arabia next!ck): [[ASIN:B003VS0CX8 The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]].

B007RXC3A8|5.0|OK, we get it. Sonata's new sound isn't as good as their old sound. Blah blah blah. Well I am a huge proponent of their \\"new\\" sound (it's not even new anymore, considering it started with Unia). I love the symphonic elements. The songs are sung with such passion and and emotion. Each song sounds completely different from the last. I'm amazed every time I listen and wonder how others aren't. But I understand why they aren't, because I hear music that they love, and I'm not amazed. So just give this album a listen and decide if you think it is amazing, too. Give it a few listens before you decide. Some people complain that they shouldn't have to get used to it but let's face it, it's not every new album you get and LOVE IT in the first listen.  I saw Sonata Arctica in concert a few nights ago and it was a brilliant show! They really are passionate about their new music and performed a lot of the old stuff too.

B0051CSIKQ|4.0|i bought this on a whim, based off of the reviews it got. I'm not really a Vampire fan, so i was skeptical. I've seen a bunch of random vampire movies, but he only one that i have seen and enjoyed was &#34;30 Days of Night&#34;, until i saw &#34;Stake Land&#34;. good plot, good concept, good acting, good effects, and good ending. there wasn't anything in particular that blew me out of the water in this flick, but everything was consistantly done well and therefore, i am pleased. would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />PS. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the packaging was less than desireable. no damage though.
0785163174|5.0|AVX was an exceptional read from cover to cover proving why Marvel comics is the premier comic book company in North America. The stories were cutting edge with iconic characters in battles that were only dreamed about a few years ago. Both teams have risen to a position comparable to the marvel-DC team mag Justice leauge vs Avengers!
B0041KKYCY|3.0|overall this movie was pretty good. especially the vengeance portion of the movie. HOWEVER, there is an awful rape scene that is way too long and detailed. i walked away from the TV. nobody should watch that part. The three stars are based off of acting, and the revenge portion.
B0061S073A|5.0|This is a God sent. My grandaughter is always wanting to use my kindle. She is 4 years old and loves to push buttons just to see what happens. I can now put her in Kids Place and she can push all the buttons she wants but can't get into my programs or order anything and I don't have to go to the trouble of putting my kindle in parental control mode for all my programs. Love it love it love it. It is such a great learning tool. It is like being in preschool whenever she wants.

1451695195|5.0|If you believe in life after death, this book will reaffirm that belief without hinting that you must be of religion \\"xyz\\" to be saved.<br /><br />If you think that all religion is a bunch of bunkum and that near death experiences are quite adequately explained by science, this book will probably waste your time.<br /><br />If you believe and follow the scientific method, this book will make you think--a lot. In short, a well-pedigreed doctor contracted an illness he shouldn't have, survived against grim odds, and had a near death experience he shouldn't have been able to have according to known neuroscience.<br /><br />This fast moving read covers the biography, illness, experiences of near death, and investigation in to how it could be explained. As a father whose father was in intensive care when I discovered the book, I found the story at times heart wrenching as Dr. Alexander described the reactions, concerns and fears of family and friends. I could all too readily identify with the people in the story. Dr. Alexander is well-qualified to examine the science side of his experience, as  brain science is his specialty. He devotes a portion of his book to the theories that attempt to explain his experience, and frontally attacks them with data.<br /><br />Three main points that I think Dr. Alexander attempts to make are: 1) we don't understand consciousness nearly as well as we think we do, 2) our consciousness is part of a larger reality and, 3) love really does power the universe and the implication that we ought to conduct ourselves that way.

B000W93CHC|3.0|Being such a huge fan of 'Pillars of the Earth', I approached 'World Without End' with the same equal parts excitement and apprehension that comes with reading the sequel to a much-loved and immensely popular book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 'World Without End' doesn't live up to the massive expectations set by 'Pillars of the Earth'.  The plot is essentially the same as 'Pillars', following the trials and tribulations of several families, representing a cross-section of Follett's fictional Kingsbridge, over the course of a lifetime. In much the same way he did in 'Pillars', Follett manages to keep most of his characters just on the threshold of happiness for most of the book without letting them cross over until almost the end.<br /><br />Some of the narrative is pretty interesting, especially the sections detailing the plague (the book is set in the 14th century). He also provides a serviceable description of the Battle of Crecy, one of the most important battles of the Hundred Years' War. What 'Pillars' had and 'World Without End' lacks is a good account of the building techniques used in those days. As I was reading 'Pillars of the Earth', I felt like I was learning things. I had that feeling a lot less with this book.<br /><br />My big problem with this book, though, is the characters. Well, one character specifically. The heroine, Caris Wooler. Follett writes her with the mores and attitudes of a 21st century woman, rather than a 14th century one. She disdains marriage and childbearing in favor of her career. She wants to be a doctor even though there were no female doctors in the 1300s. She questions the teachings of the Church. She's also highly annoying. She loves Merthin but won't marry him. She becomes pregnant with his child but aborts it (a decision she regrets). She gets jealous when Merthin marries even though she has joined the convent. She takes him completely for granted. And in the best tradition of the modern, domesticated male, Merthin puts up with it.<br /><br />Follett does provide us with two odious antagonists, however, Priors Godwyn and Philemon. These are very much the proverbial 'guys you love to hate'. We also get the peasant's perspective in the form of Gwenda and Wulfric, another star-crossed couple.<br /><br />I guess this just felt like more of the same, only not as good. Add to that a hugely annoying heroine and the book fell flat for me.th it.<br /><br />Follett does provide us with two odious antagonists, however, Priors Godwyn and Philemon.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Grand conclusion to Christopher Nolan's trilogy. Is there going to be a Robin movie given the inference at the very end of the movie when Joseph Gordon Levitt says (rather quietly) that his name in Robin while he is looking at the Batcave?

B0086DBE62|3.0|Mirror Mirror is like the opposite of Snow White and the Huntsman. Where the latter movie tried to depict a serious, grim fairy tale, Mirror Mirror tries to be hip and lighthearted. For kids, this might work, but for adults the humor often falls flat and feels out of place. The movie is very light on plot or character and seems to try to fill the time with these silly moments. Another problem is that Julia Roberts tries to make this her movie, but she can't pull off a threatening evil queen. Overall, this movie will probably go over fine with kids or young teens, but I have to wonder why it was made at all.
0307592731|5.0|If you've ever known someone who was in so much pain and confusion that they made foolish, self-destructive choices - and then had the determination to turn their life around, you will enjoy this book immensely. Not to give it all away, but the author was a sensitive girl who lived through a terrible childhood only to lose the one person who had been a constant support in her life. She sought validation in the wrong places, made a lot of stupid choices, and shows us her journey without sugarcoating or whitewashing. Read it if you dare!

B00975L81Y|4.0|It has a Dusk And Her Embrace, Damnation Sound...Its A Great Album Overall and Worth the money...Just Saying...THEYRE BACK and definitely up to standard again as one of the most Extreme Metal Bands Out There...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and hated to see it end. I would encourage everyone to read this book! A must read
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great series of books, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  I recommend that all couple's read this. It has helped us reconnect in the bedroom....we are going at it like teenagers. A great read and inspiring fun ideas to explore with your lover.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|The app sounded interesting but I got charged for the app and it never downloaded to my Kindle. I tried twice and got the same message -unable to download. So why did I get charged for an app I couldn't even get?
B009LK6JS2|2.0|I thought it was going to be a great game, but just when I was learning how to fly land it went wacko on me. now every time I try to fly,  it goes crazy the game keeps flipping up side down and you just crash and burn or you start flying and it blows up and crashes on you.  it sucks. that was the free version, so I bought the pay version and it did the same thing.<br />.
B008KE3960|4.0|Air Patriots is a fun game and the physics works well. You basically make a path with your finger on the screen for your planes to follow and destroy incoming tanks. It is not as easy as it loks and different aircraft work better on different tanks. It takes a while to find the right combination which is part of the fun of playing the gam. Eventually youy run out of \\"free\\" options and need to pay real money if you want to upgrade. There is plenty to do on the free side until then.[...]
B008CLI3TE|3.0|Unfortunately I did not catch this until after the warranty was complete.  The rest of the discs are just fine, but would be nice to have a replacement for Disc 1
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Just make sure you don't have anything else to do . . . you won't be able to put it down.
1905236042|5.0|My husband and I both do yoga, so our children often participate. These cards allow them to set their own routine and encourage them to try new poses.<br />This is a good option for beginners; the illustrations and descriptions help you understand body placement, though I do recommend buying or borrowing a book on yoga to go along with the cards until you become familiar with proper technique.
B00004XQ83|5.0|had this disc a while back and someone took it.  Finally found just the music and am happy to have it.
0307719774|3.0|The binding cracks and creeks when you try to open the book.  I hope it lasts for 5 years of journaling...
B007FG9LIE|5.0|If you're like me you might want to consider setting aside enough time to read this in one sitting... Because you're not going to want to put it down.  On one level, this book is a thriller that you will keep you interested.  On another, it will keep your mind working and trying to process the revelations that seem just a little bit... \\"off\\".  At certain points in the book, anyone who has some math skills like me will begin to second guess what they are reading and checking back to confirm they remembered earlier revelations and then wondering how this could all fit together.<br /><br />In the end, the triller morphs into a compact package that is thought provoking.  It raises very significant ethical, moral and societal questions to ponder later, after you are done with the good read.<br /><br />I am also left wondering if the author truly believes in the reasons given that caused the event to occur.  Those reasons given are the one aspect of this book that really pushes the bounds of reason, at least for someone with my worldview.  Whether the author believes this way or not, it is still written well and at an engaging pace.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is A fun game with an easy to follow tutorial. it is a fun way to waste a little time.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|I enjoy WWII novels and this one was very enjoyable and provided a very engaging and readable book.  I will get more from this author.
B00006D295|5.0|Classic movie, and a GREAT price!! That's about all I have to say about this!!!! I think anyone should buy this movie, for this price!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very rewarding read.  Many insights to WWI that I never understood before.  It also brought together the timeline for many other events in that era.
B002LII6KA|5.0|I bought this for my dad, and he LOVES it, he is a HUGE matrix fan!!! I think every matrix fan should own this, it has a lot of AWESOME features!! I recommend this product highly!!!
0345529057|5.0|paper quality is fine, editing is good, price is great. i didn't have any problem with the delivery or any of the books. more than 4000 pages of a great story for $21...
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I love this movie, and I think it will be a great Christmas present for my Brother-In-Law, it showed up quick, and had no damage, I also think it was GREAT price!!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Kept my grandson's and wife's attention (no multi-tasking) throughout! Both agree it was the best video they have seen in some time  - even though my grandson had already seen it a half dozen times.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Excellent box set from one of the best American hard rock bands.  Every album brings back memories of my youth collecting the BOC catalog, spinning the vinyl, studying the album artwork, and getting immersed in the music and mystique.  Too few bands then and now have/had the power, the hooks, the chops, or the artistry of BOC.  One of the few bands where every album was special to me. My favorite song of all is Astronomy with The Last Days of May (live) a close second.  Favorite album is Secret Treaties.<br /><br />The box set includes all studio and live albums from 1972  through 1988 and 2 extra discs of rarities and the best of the broadcasts.  Also able to download (once bugs worked out with web site) 4 additional live shows from the early to mid 1980's.<br /><br />The discs are housed in individual mini-lp sleeves with replicated artwork and stored in a space saving box. Although no individual liner notes provided, all the CDs are remastered from either prior reissues or for the first time in 2012. To my ears, these CDs sound great. Highly recommended.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the show, and love that I can watch it on my computer, iPad & TV. If you haven't watched The Walking Dead, you must be brain dead!
1451695195|5.0|Read it and pass it on to a friend!  After reading this book,  I felt at peace.  Thank you for this book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|When music has gone from peoples hearts to the market industry, it's almost a miracle to find such talented people with inspiration, energy and vision, to fill you up with such emotion. The music is awesome and majestic. The performances are intimate and full hearted, the choices perfect, the implementation...... blows you away.....<br />The Piano Guys made my life richer, dressed many moments with strong sentiments and I haven't met even one man or woman that I introduced to the Piano Guys Videos and music, and didn't feel the awe of their music.<br />It really shows that they love what they do. And you can feel that love, and pass it on...<br />Totally worth it.<br />Piano guys....<br /><br />Thank you
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game you can win this one.  I' v played some where you win about every 30th game or it seems like it.  this one makes you feel like you win because of your skill.
B009369Z8A|2.0|I love this movie but case inside and outside is broken very sloppy packed and movie delivered with case all broken very unhappy
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have been waiting a very long time for this game to come out for kindle fire and I have to say this is an amazing game!!! I love it so much!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is my favorite author of all time. i Love courtroom thrillers and he is the master of them. All readers should buy at least one of his books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The beginning was slow reading, but not boring.  After the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down.The many twists and turns of the book,really kept me going!  I loved this book! zvp
043599445X|5.0|It's a book, it has words, it works, what else can we say. Used for school and passed the course
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Now this is how a superhero movie team up is suppose to be made keeps you hyped from beginning to the end
B002NEFL8W|5.0|The item is from fresh stock.  There was no issues with operation of this item.  Worked smoothly with no problems.  Great Value!
0446580848|3.0|I feel I'm an expert on Yemen after reading this book, although there was a little John Corey story thrown in!  Having said that however, I believe Nelson DeMille's writing, at its worst, is better than that of many other popular authors at their best.  He always tells a good story.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a really interesting book.  It is interesting to me that flowers have so much meaning.  It opened up my mind to a new word.  Isn't that what books are supposed to do.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Great season of one of the best shows on television today.  I would strongly recommend this series to anyone, especially if they have a little &#34;nerd&#34; in them as well....
B008LZHA3G|5.0|As usual, Dylan has delivered another winner. The lyrics are outstanding, as always. Pay particular attention to &#34;Pay in Blood&#34;, the lyrics may have you thinking something that is not the case. To whom does he refer? Himself? Christ? Tempest, the song, is also great, a very long poem on the Titanic. Outstanding.
0811879542|5.0|My three year old loves to read this book and follow the directions.... Lots of fun and giggles!  Highly recommended!
1419705849|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a teen who can't get enough of the &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; series, so I'm sure it will go over big!
B004SGWYW4|4.0|This is a fun anime about a group of high school kids who are pushed to edge of reason, humanity and character...all because of a zombie epidemic. It makes them question their beliefs, morals and each other. Good starting point for anime noobs. What would you do, or not do, if zombies took over your city?
B0026S1XD2|5.0|While I made my purchasing decision SOLEY upon the Amazon customer reviews and had NOT heard it since it's first release in the 1970s, the album met my high expectations.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Quiet imaginative and different from the usual fare of si/fi-fantasy books available.  this series is written using simple language and is suited to both teenage and adult readers.
1441869980|5.0|I like this product because it made driving calm and peaceful. The product exceeded my expectations, the story was excellent.
0763619612|5.0|I love this book. I love the lesson it teaches, that all of us have something to give if we just try.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|First, I loved the movie, however, I actually ended up not purchasing this item.  I wanted to purchase the DVD. The description said it came with a free Ultraviolet download, but when I read the reviews of this &#34;free&#34; product I found that SEVERAL people said the free download is nothing but a scam.  Then I re-read the description of what I thought was for the DVD, and could not find that I would actually be getting the DVD with the so called &#34;free download&#34;, so I cancelled the purchase.  Buyer beware - do you homework with any on-line purchase!  I still love Amazon, just surprised they let this slip through.
0399215980|1.0|really bad condition I dont even think this book can hold up for a week before it completely falls apart..
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I had a very similar experience to many other users on here: bought it, worked great for a couple of months, started getting really picky with how I had it positioned, and eventually quit working altogether. Not to mention that the cord is really stiff and doesn't bend well. Very bad product, don't buy it!
B004GFN11A|4.0|I am new to blogging and Wordpress is making it easy for me. I highly recommend this site for bloggers and readers alike!
B000I9YLWG|5.0|The movie is a classic.  Amazon delivered it to us a few minutes after we decided to watch it again after many years.  I love this new era we're in: think of a movie, tap, tap, tap and you're watching it.  We bought as opposed to rent, since we know we're going to watch this incredible film again and again.  Five stars for everything for sure.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|My husband could not wait for this to come so he could see it over and over again. Alien fans and those new to Ridley Scott's Alien series will enjoy this awesome sci-fi film.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Wonderful read! I can't wait to see the movie. I'm just glad I am finally able to read this timeless tale.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I like Aerosmith since the first time I listened, I love her music, and Carrie Underwood is a A plus.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed the book!  Great to understand more about what our service men and women do for us everyday.  Thank You!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|If you're into history this is a great one!  I love historical fiction that makes you think. This book does that. Plus it makes the forces that came into play in creating Wirld War 1 more understandable. I am a slow reader but zipped through this book. I look forward to the sequel.
B00006CXSS|5.0|received collection within a few days, I was very impressed with the packaging.  I bought it as a gift for someone who has been wanting this collection forever.  I hope they like it!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I absolutely loved this game! It seems as though the cheaper games are the best, but this one was free. I do think the usual $5 price tag on these games is too much for these types of games, but what ya gonna do. It was kinda short, but that was ok. It really was a fun game, so I gave it 5 STARS!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Super fun! Well worth the $2.99 price!  I sometimes get frustrated when games are too complicated that they are no longer fun.  This game was challenging but stayed at the right level throughout!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Worth every penny. If you like mystery games you will love this one.It has everything you want and the hints help if you get stuck.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I just purchased a Kindle Fire HD (I had already loved the Kindle Fire and upgraded) and it arrived yesterday.  The Facebook app is extremely dissapointing.  I can only see the first 5 or 6 in my news feed and then it goes gray and doesn't load anymore.  Luckily, FB is not my only use for the Fire HD, and I still love the device.....but it is such a waste for checking FB news and updates....will have to use my phone for that.  PLEASE fix this issue so that those of us who have the new version can enjoy it.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|Movie came in great condition for a great price. Fun movie for everything one to watch and enjoy in many families.
B008JAG2AA|5.0|funny movie. seen all of them and have to say it was as funny as rest of them. u just sit and watch and laught
B004UUKDNA|4.0|I bought this for my husband who is a fan of their song pumped up kicks. He loves the whole album.  I think that alot of their songs sound all the same especially at the very begining but hey he listens to it.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|was very nice surprise with this movie...and i loved it!  its one of those movies what i would watch few more times and i recomend it for everybody...
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I got this device because it was reasonably priced and people had<br />had reported  success using it with the GID meter software for the Nissan LEAF all<br />electric vehicle.<br />In my application, the drivers work fine but I have to play with the<br />configuration each time to get the data to record.<br />I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers on Windows 8 which I<br />downloaded from the website and they work fine but I have to<br />see which port the device came up on each time I use it and<br />configure it in my custom software.<br />I just have not had time to see what I am doing wrong, and correct<br />it. The device itself works great and seems to be very accurate.<br />There probably is a simple way to get it to come up on the<br />port I want every time but I have not had time to investigate this.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|was ok, funny and kinda diferent. would watch probably few more times. but still for a hudge fun of family guy was still not as good as i would expect
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|not enough  coins to play with but still the games was semi-addictive to me, I plan to re-download on another phone
B008EQIK90|4.0|like it a lot. was going to see it in the theater but they didnt play anymore, happy i see it here
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|It is the very best of Shania Twain.  It includes her latest song and many of her previous top hits.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|for somebody who dont like this kind of movies i was pretty nice surprise. not too bad, not too bad at all
B004FOA84A|3.0|I have just discovered these types of games and love them.  I thought it would be worth $.99 to play.  It was fun and challenging but way too short.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|my husband loved it...i didnt watch cause im not fun of this kind of movies at all, but he seemd to be very satified
B002WY65VU|5.0|Almost everyone I know who has seen this movie, loves it. Which is saying a lot considering the variety of tastes. For me, it was one of the best zombie movies I've seen and has something for everybody, a little comedy, a little action, a little romance, even a little bromance. And the comedy fits right in without being too over the top cheesy.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|was ok, little bit disepointed, expect little bit more after seeing all the previews. i wont see it again. thought it would be more funny
B002CM03PQ|5.0|DVD actually exceeded expectations with the quality of the sound.  Historical footage is fun to share with friends and children (who roll their eyes).  Even got a bonus tamborine with the package that I wasn't expecting.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It keeps you guessing. Full of twists and turns that keep it interesting to the very end. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had been recommended this book & was a bit disappointed.  I know it has been popular, been I just felt this dragged on & on.<br />I didn't have much compassion for any of these characters.
B007N31XTY|5.0|Peter Jackson's (lord of the Rings) update of the Classic King Kong  featured then state of the art CGI effects and non-stop action. Brilliant performances by Andy Serkis (as the digitally created Kong) and Naomi Watts as the heroine is as memorable as Fay Wray in the original. Even Jack Black rises to the occasion. For Universal's 100th anniversary Blu ray edition they have included a DVD and digital copy and added a nice collection of extras. Well worth adding to your movie collection.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another wonderful work of art by Ken Follett.  He is a wonderful writer & such a great researcher of his work on all his historical novels.  I am waiting for Book Three in this trilogy.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|My 14 year old son is very intrigued by Navy SEALS.  We have been to the SEAL museum and he feels it is something he would like to do as an adult.  The movie portrayed the reality of the SEAL life.  Year long deployment, the bond between the team members.  It was very realistic in how the missions played out.  It was excellent.  Not recommended for immature kids or young kids.  My son is very mature and not a gamer.
B0015AARJI|5.0|excelente... me llego rápido y el producto muy bueno.....desde Venezuela. TODO MUY BIEN.<br />recomendado 100% a todos. saludos y gracias
1451695195|5.0|This is the most profound book I've ever read.  It discusses the most profoundly important subject there is, and reveals truths everybody should know about.  It's an incredible read. . . but the most fantastic thing about it is . . . that it is fully credible.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|TripAdvisor was super easy to use.  It helped us find our way from attractions to hotels to restaurants with excellent maps.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Honestly, I thought this would be one of those albums where every song sounded the same.. I thought they would all just be about being a party animal, with no meaning behind it.<br />But NO. This album is great. The sound it has is amazing. The first track, Warrior, sets the mood for an amazing expirience that IS this album.<br />I'd highly suggest buying the whole album, instead of just tracks you know. You'll be sure to fall in love with it. &#60;3<br />100.2% satisfaction guarentee in my book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very good story could not stop readimg until the end of all 3 books . I recomend the Hungery Games Trilogy to everyone all ages. A great Christmas gift.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|serves it's purpose.  Dents easily so be careful with it.  The fact that apple needed to invent this because they are too close minded to maintain any sort of power adapter re-useability for multiple product purchasers is a travesty of product management groupthink.
0007466064|3.0|My husband wanted the HB of Dance with Dragons that had both parts. I didn't know there was 2 parts and ordered the wrong one. He has complained but read it anyway. Thanks
0374214913|5.0|I loved this book.  I basically read this book straight through in one day.  The writing style sucks you in and keeps you going.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Acting poor-story line hard to follow-where is Matt?The other Boune movies were much better.Would not remmend this movie to others.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|With this set, you can disassemble any pc or mac.<br />Take apart hard drive, mini hard drive.<br />Watches, small electronic machines...
B00009V7P8|5.0|I love this CD.  His words are piercing. The music is compelling and the the overall tone of the music makes you reflect on life.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Still one of Christmas's best movies.  A feel good movie that every family should watch over the holidays. This one will never go out of style.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Super cast, always something happening! I never get tired of seeing this movie...cute love drama with a little comedy angle they throw in.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|This is my first bubble game so I can't compare it to others but I enjoyed playing it at first till it starting messing up, it will play fine up to level 12 then the bubbles that you shoot will start being half sized and the game will pop up and say that you have lost even when you have plenty bubbles left to play. Going to delete it and find a better version.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The best show on TV.  The third season is 99% as good as the first two seasons.  You are missing out if you haven't watched the Walking Dead.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Wasn't sure how this game was going to be, but had a lot of fun! It was over way too quickly!  It was challenging and definitely worth the money!
B008XBASVY|5.0|This book was written for teens, by a young man who is barely out of his teens himself, and therefore it will have a better chance of sounding truthful, I believe, than something written by someone who went to high school decades ago.  I say this as someone who has been out of high school for a few decades.  Normally, I find I don't relate well to books that are written for young adult readers, but in this case, it reminds me painfully of some of the feelings I went through in high school.  Anyone who has felt like an outsider, like you don't quite fit in anywhere, will probably be able to relate to this book.<br /><br />Chris Colfer wrote this as a companion to the movie he wrote and starred in, Struck By Lightning, which will be available for viewing soon at Amazon and other places.  This is meant to be a companion, rather than an adaptation of the script, and I think the two together will give a more complete look at the characters.  This novel is told from the view of the protagonist, Carson Phillips, an ambitious young man who desperately wants to get out of his small town and conquer the world through journalism.  Carson isn't always the most pleasant person, and he's more than a little arrogant, yet vulnerable and relatable even to those of us who don't use sarcasm as a weapon.<br /><br />The method Carson has chosen to better his chances for getting into Northwestern University isn't one I would recommend to anyone, yet in this case, it helps others as well as Carson.  He finds blackmail material on a number of other students, in order to get them to make submissions to a literary journal.  He's not well-liked at his school, to put it mildly, so he resorted to this extreme measure to get some cooperation.  It actually proves to give us more insight into the students, and Carson starts to see them as more than just stereotypes, but people with feelings as vulnerable as his own.  He's not the only one to hide behind walls of cynicism.<br /><br />There is a lotof humor in the book, not all of it politically correct, but it should make most people laugh out loud in at least a few places.  There's a strong message here, too, to enjoy your life while you're living it.  Carson learns too late that if you constantly live in the past or the future, and try to ignore the present, you'll miss out on much that life has to offer.  The book doesn't have a happy ending, but it is an oddly positive one.<br /><br />It's a short book, and told in the style of a journal, so it won't take long to read, but you should find it well worth the time to invest.  And if you like the book, check out the movie, and vice versa.  Together they tell a more complete story.  The movie shows the perspectives of other characters, but as the book is a journal, it's Carson's viewpoint, so he missed some things that are in the movie.  Yet we also get more of an inside look at his personality and motivations, so they really should be seen as two parts of the same story.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just enough room for my essentials and laptop...flash. This bag beats my old Kmart brand one by price and room availability.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|The Skyfall soundtrack follows in the tradition of many great Bond soundtracks.  The music by Thomas Newman certainly doesn't disappoint.  The excitement of the movie is recreated each time you listen.  Highly recommend!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I downloaded this game because my son was learning about the Oregon Trail in school and I wanted to show him this (as I played in school), this is NOT that game. This is a &#34;farmvill&#34; type game. You build a town and buy stuff. Not good.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Josh brolin totally made this movie as a young agent k.  Story plot okay nothing spectacular.  Really just a fun no-brainer<br />.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great free app that I have never had an issue with on my Droid X or Samsung Galaxy SII.  It is great to have when you unexpectedly have to wait for an appointment or get stuck without entertainment.  I love that I can not only read the books I have already purchased, but can also buy new books right from the app.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|has to be one of his best, suspenseful right to the end, can't wait until the next one comes out
B007HACDLK|3.0|It was ok but seems like the same story over and over, any other touble besides Islamics? and that's all I have to say about that
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best in the Mich Rapp series.  I found it very hard to put down.  I would recommend it to everyone who likes the series.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|The sounds of the holidays are even better when sung by James Taylor!= -  This is a beautiful Christmas album and will become a family favorite!
B00284BNKC|5.0|this movie is just heartrending. the way its filmed makes you want to visually devour every little bit of film. it goes over the top at times but that can be forgiven since its such an effective film.<br /><br />the soundtrack is amazing, dts really shines.<br /><br />this is marlon wayans best work not counting white chicks, which im now going to watch to counteract requiem.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|not sure what was wrong, but the Kindle wouldn't talk to our wireless printer. maybe with more investigation we can get it to work.
B007HACDLK|4.0|the writer for one .the cast are my alltime  favorites.taking it to the enemy before they get us,probably more truth than fiction.i can hardly  wait for the next book.
B008F5QQI2|4.0|Good song, but why now new full CD of new material? Since its been awhile since this cd single was released, tbuying the single may be the only way to get this particular song until he releases ANOTHER Best of, which if you notice lately, they come every week...<br />If you are his biggest fan ever, purchase the single. If you just enjoy George whenever he gets around to releasing new material, wait for the next best of...<br />George, stay away from all the parties and bathrooms and record a new album worth of material... we're waiting....
B009G78EE2|4.0|I'd bought this album just for Same Love and Thrift Shop but kept listening for the rest of the tracks.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Changing this review, as a very helpful CS person at Amazon told me how to find the app on my kindle....now that I am using it, I like it....seems to work fine ...the only thing I don't care for with it is the fact that you have to go to a 2nd screen to see comments on someone's status and then go back to your original page to continue.  But, that is apparently inherent with these smaller devices<br />...other than that it works great.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Fun movie. The factual treatment of the &#34;pot game&#34; is quite skewed to add to the drama, not sure if I like how it is portrayed-yes if the character O had been using pot for a long time she would be uncomfortable not having it-there is a withdrawl period of minor physical and mental consequences, but it would not be enough to beg captors for it. It wasn't heroin or opium. Other than the exaggerated behaviors surrounding the entire idea of the substance it was fun. Cute love triangle story. *possible spoiler* the tack-on ending blows. Should've stuck with the first one.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|Here's the very interesting customer forum discussion about the pervasive storage problem on Kindle Fires: http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread=Tx3U33EYEVPL46B<br /><br />You'll notice that the prescribed solution is this app, referred to by some as WFFE. But it isn't working for me, so my Kindle Fire is still maxed out on storage due to movies that I previously downloaded, viewed, then deleted.<br /><br />Extremely frustrated and wondering if Amazon will rise to the occasion.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|If you can try it out before you buy it, you'll see.  This is worth the 20 or so bucks.  So convenient.  Any kind of music sounds 100% better through this.  Only negatives are the size (its so small it can easily get lost or accidentally put through the wash), and the fact that the recharge cord (included) is fairly short.  But it's not a proprietary connection so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />This thing WORKS.  With headphones, earbuds, or an input jack in a car, this makes a 200$ ipod sound like something way more expensive.  Try it if you got 20 bucks to spare!
B003M5AXN4|5.0|Love this movie, love the style they shot it in. I can't imagine a better recreation for speed racer, and must say that the last race scene just blows me away, get chills every time I see it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have read this book three times already and can't get enough of it. Possibly the best fantasy book I've ever read. Fantastic character development, mysterious and engaging story, and awesome moments of triumph and sorrow. Cannot recommend this book enough. I also can't wait for the next one.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I am happy with the price of this headset AND it got here 2 days early! Within 3 days! It is a Christmas present so I don't know if it works but I'm hoping it does, if so I will be extremely happy!

B0063IH60K|3.0|Not exactly what I was looking for but it will work. Just not the same as solitaire on the computer or my kitchen table.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Both my daughters play with this daily they want to be designers when they grow up. There ages are 6 and 7.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|I bawled like a baby! Clint Eastwood is amazing in this movie! And who would have known, how old is he anyway!?
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Another money pit game but great for what it is. Great for MLP fans but not a long term game unless you have money or time to burn
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not very well written.  Nothing but graphic descriptions.  I got 30% into it and stopped.  Will not read it or the other two.
B002436WFI|5.0|The cast of this DVD was obviously chosen with care.  I have read the books over and over and these chosen characters fit my imagination very well.  I would recommend this DVD to any Pratchett fan and anyone else who likes a bit of whimsy and a dose of parody for good measure.<br />LMW
B00AMBH70S|5.0|When I read 'this is the best Bourne Yet!' I didn't believe it... but it is an excellent movie and great addition to that series.
0316069434|5.0|I found this another enjoyable read, especially after being burned by that mix of half Lincoln Lawyer and half Harry Bosch in The Reversal. This story blew that one out of the water. Pure Harry.<br /><br />I haven't read the entire catalog, so I can't complain about him losing steam as some readers have accused the author of doing. To me, this is a breath of fresh air after all the thrillers I've been reading. I'm slowly going through Connelley's back catalogue but when I saw this latest release I couldn't resist.<br /><br />As usual, Harry's on a cold case that harkens back to the Rodney King-era LA riots when a Danish reporter is murdered. It leads him into some unexpected places. Of course, there is a bit of personal drama plus having to deal with a new boss who has it out for him.<br /><br />The ending was pretty cool, taking care of business yet leaving a few things hanging for future installments.<br /><br />The way Connelly meticulously builds the story and keeps things moving is what keeps me glued to my seat. It never gets boring, or hasn't yet. His narrative never bogs down or goes off on tangents and everything has a purpose. He keeps it in solid third person and rarely head-hops.<br /><br />Meticulous detail abounds and that makes the story seem all the more real. At least it was for me. Highly recommended.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Awesome movie! Funny, entertaining, and family friendly! Great movie for Christmas time! I would highly recommend it to anyone! Thanks Amazon!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Having read all the Bosch stories I found this one to be consistant with his (Bosch)professional brilliance and his personal battles. The story is excellent as is the detective work. Connelly is always accurate with the technical aspects of his stories however, the timleyness of the Internal Affairs Detective arrival at the barn is a bit of a stretch. Regardless, it's a &#34;page turner&#34; and certainly not predictable.<br />I hope Harry continues his love relationship in future novels as the guy deserves a break. Also, looks to me like we have a future Detective Bosch in the works.<br />Michael Connelly continues to entertain his readers with great stories but his advisors have a skewed perspective and/or experience with the police brass. Certainly somewhere there are leaders who will do the right thing because it's the right thing to do ! Obviously none at the LAPD.
B000HL0EEE|4.0|I don't like Scott Bakula in any of his other TV shows.. but I believe he actually fit in this show as an early Star Fleet Captain. This series was a good for those who need a sci-fi fix.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was very amazing. I liked it a lot, I used this book on a science project and it worked out great mainly because I could not put it down. My dad would always say \\"Time to go to bed,\\" and my answer always was \\"I am at a really good part!\\"
0823023494|5.0|The author of this book walks you through the steps and detailed exercises on creating a line of characters for a feature animation. You get a good glimpse into the process the professionals do when creating/planning a feature animation.<br /><br />If you want pointers on creating your own characters this is the book to have. I also recommend the Character Mentor as a follow-up book to this to help give your new characters life.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never ceases to amaze one.  He writes the most fulfilling stories.  I hope that he will continue to do so.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|It was clear in many episodes there was a budget crunch. Otherwise a good series. Some episodes were exceptional stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Have been wanting to read this series of books and wasn't disappointed.  Many other people have recommended it but didn't have the chance till recently.
B009LY72LQ|5.0|Two full dolls and one wig. Exactly what I ordered and good price. Very nice packaging and good value for the price. Two nice dolls for less than the price of one. Love the skin texture on the dragon doll. Dragon doll looks perfect without the wig.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I have wanted a copy of this movie for quite some time. The price was right so I purchased it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|One of my favorite movies! I love every thing in the box!  Hope there can be more kinds of subtitles.
034580404X|4.0|Books are in great shape, the writing inside them (from the writer not printer) not so great. They kept my attention but were an easy read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very well written and lots of developing plots. Did not disappoint after hunger games book 1  kept me glued to the  pages....catching fire did the same thing! Looking forward to reading the final book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I don't have any problems playing it. Never freezes up and I have the new Fire HD 8.9.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Ok book. It was a little slow and boring. I feel like a lot of things could have been left out.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Really good album.  I would recommend it over Stadium Arcadium.  The CD came undamaged, and I enjoy listening to it.
B001POXA02|5.0|I already had a Seiko automatic which I really liked until recently now that it's started losing a couple of minutes each day.  This watch was pretty accurate for the first year or two.  But this new Seiko is a kinetic and from what I've read this type of movement, which was pioneered by Seiko does not have the problems down the road with accuracy that automatics typically do.  Now that I've had it for a month, I'd have to say it can't be more than about 5 seconds off.  It's a dive watch, and like the automatic dive watch that preceded it, this watch is pretty substantial.  Lighter weight watches simply don't do it for me.  With this model Seiko's attention to detail was flawless.  I have found the rotating bezel of a diver's watch to be extremely useful and not just for diving.  For example if I want to swim for 45 minutes I can rotate the bezel in seconds so that I can easily keep track of how much time I've been swimming.  This watch has an extremely smooth rotating bezel that is very easy to set.  I also love the appearance of this watch.  It's all metal, but the band and outer casing is a dark color that goes very nicely with the black face of the watch.
B0000C1733|4.0|The center piece in the jewel case the holds the cd was broken, when I received the disc. Everything else was fine.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love drawing the characters and watching them come to life.  the puzzles are challenging.<br />  I really like playing it.  good game
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Christmas present for son. Kind of spendy, but this is what he wanted. I copied some of it for myself.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|I have to admit, I had been backtracking and listening to the White Stripes albums.  After getting into them I used some free Amazon points to buy &#34;Blunderbuss.&#34;  I went into this expecting it to be more of a lost album and a different style then the White Stripes.  I was wrong.  I can listen to this entire album on repeat, which is something I can't say about a lot of musicians/albums.  Support this style because I can't wait to hear more.  Buy it!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Great story with engaging characters. Excellent acting from Matt Damon and Jon voight. All of John grisham's movies are worth watching.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Racketeer is a great book!!!  Enjoyed reading and had difficulty putting it down until finished.  The twists and turns of the story were amazing.  John Grisham did a great job with this book.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is simply amazing. i honestly didnt expect to like this game as much as i do. i have assassins creed 3 and little big planet as well and they dont nearly get me hooked for hours like this game does, in fact, not many games at all have.<br />i usually get bored/tired of games fast, and its irritating.<br /><br />now with the packaging, the game was brand new in a case/plastic but came with no manual, is that normal? most games do. it also came with a persona 4 skin! i didnt expect to get one, definitely a plus. anyone who likes RPGs should try this
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I always look forward to reading Patricia Cornwell's books.  This was a great book as always!!!  Recommend it to her fans.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|So we all know what Friends is all about. I won't bore you with the details of the show. Let me just say that the video and audio quality are superior to anything else that was previously sold.I never thought there would be a day that I could see this much detail in each episode.If you like or love the show, you won't be disappointed. Please ignore the non verified reviews that leave the pointless reviews....Nothing is ever perfect, but this set is really close considering how long it's been since the original airings....
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I got it because I had seen it playing at a TV store and thought it was very colorful. It certainly is. My lo wants to watch it all the time. It also has a great message: saving the trees. I really like it.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|This was for my granddaughter & she loves it.  I'm not a big Twillight fan but watched all of them.
B000GCFD72|5.0|When my son was about to turn 2, he began acting up and I started to think about the issue of discipline. I read other books that focused on tips to make your child behave better, or how to deal with the outbursts. But this book addresses the overall picture and the attitude of parents toward their kids. It really changed my perspective. I went from wanting to &#34;discipline&#34; my child and change his behavior, to respecting him and REALLY showing unconditional love. Actions speak louder than words. I really recommend it.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I purchased 2 of these CD's as gifts and specifically because of the song<br />\\"Fade into you\\".  The sticker on the label says the song is on the CD,<br />however when you look at the song list on the back, it is not listed. Shady.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|Love this thing.  All of the Arduinos are great products.  This is a genuine arduino Leonardo.  The pre-soldered headers are nice, although if you are decent with a soldering iron, they are 0.1&#34; headers, so it can be done if you already have the headers and order the version without.<br /><br />I have been programming microcontrollers for several years, and the Arduino is a great platform for bringing up a circuit quickly and trying out new concepts, without the fuss of creating a complicated project that is required of other traditionally microcontrollers for programming.  This would make a great gift for someone who loves to play around with electronics, and even those in school looking to get started with electrical concepts.
B008J34466|5.0|Love love this album! My eldest daughter already knows all the lyrics lol I love that I can relate with some of her songs and it's just an awesome album to listen to whether you're throwing a cool little party or in your car on your way home from work.

0385344333|5.0|Just finished it, and will re sell it. perfect condition, and a good read. Ive read all of his books, this one is as good as the rest.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|His most philosophical based book.  He makes sense of his previous two books with this writing which is the glue for his thinking.  Although somewhat esoteric and some academic hubris in the beginning of the book, his mission of seeking opportunity among disorder is an important addition to investment analytic thinking which still seems linear today.  His thinking is not out of the box thinking, but it is a configural pattern of thinking, not linear.  And, in this way, it is like his other two books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Vulgar, explicit, down right dirty.  Gideon and Eva are hot together!  Yes, you can tell some ideas are taken from fifty shades but this is by far more seductive.  Loved it!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Only reason I stopped playing was the battery went dead on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9<br />Glad they found a fix for waht was causing the game not to work on the 8.9
034580404X|4.0|Good series, reasonable price for the box set. Though the box part falls apart easily I noticed, which annoyed me to no end.

B004ZQRFGM|5.0|latest cd  things do get better with time under her belt  she's a cross between  Debbie Davie and Bonnie Raitt
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is worth a read. Dr Alexander is a professional specializing in the human brain, its diseases and its function. Here , you have the testimony of someone who cannot be accused of being a wishful hysteric in his description of his post life experiences. When Alexander says, that after he recovered from his death experience, he reviewed his medical charts and confirmed that he was ABSOLUTELY brain dead, we can believe him. He is the authority.<br /> However, there is an aspect of his account that leaves me sorry for him. His relating of his experience seems to have failed to cause him to submit to the 'Light'. He , yet, maintains much of the intellectual impudence that raises barriers to full submission to the actuality of God; at least, that is my take on what he relates to us.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Great read Would recommend to anybody  As always Ken keeps one captivated to the very end  When will his next book be released
B004U52VPS|4.0|I thought it'd be a little bigger than it was. The box is about the size of a cereal box & the birds are about the size of a small keychain toy (which I actually like a lot better because if the kids get tired of them, I'll just turn them into keychains!) & the birds squeak a little because they have holes in the bottom like rubber duckies & they're soft like rubber duckies, too. The pigs are made of a solid yet hollow plastic & their faces are stickers.<br />The Bird Launcher is made of plastic that is durable yet soft so that it won't be able to be used as a slingshot but it will shot the soft rubber birds properly which means that adults won't have to worry much about Angry Birds flying across the room (unless the kids throw them with their own hands, of course).<br />I'm not sure if what comes with the product is said in the description but just in case, I'll let you know:<br /><br />3 Angry Birds (which works for me since I brought this game for my niece & two nephews to play together)<br />4 Pigs<br />1 Bonus Point Star<br />1 Bonus Point Egg<br />14 Building Blocks - 2 squares, 2 triangles, 4 small girders, 6 larger girders<br />1 Bird Launcher<br />40 Mission Cards<br />16 Point Cards<br />Card Instructions<br /><br />The product is in great condition & I'm sure that the children will have a great time playing the game for real (which will allow me to play the game on the computer! YES!!) so I really don't have any complaints other than thinking it was going to be larger. Next time, I'll just have to check the dimensions better before buying something. Other than that, it's worth buying if your children are into the game & you want them off your electronics.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Good character development and ingenious at times, I'd equate it with a 30 minute sitcom stretched to a full length movie.
B009KHCRVO|1.0|Movie was terrible.  Don't bother watching it. Didn't even finish it...waste of my time. I though it was a good plot, but I was wrong.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|The plot starts good, until the female scientist is impregnated by an &#34;alien?&#34;. Where did this one come from? If you like SciFi, this is a good product.
0321857895|5.0|Mike Rohde does an outstanding job! His work is amazing and he shares exactly how he does it. His techniques are easy to follow and carefully laid out. Best of all, I now am taking far better and more interesting notes!<br /><br />I would suggest getting the printed version because the book feels like a Moleskin. The quality of this book is beyond superior from it's carefully thought out content to it's overall construction. It's certainly a must have for any book collection.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|it's ok, sort of like bowling or pool.... it was free so i gave it a try; do not know if i'll play it again. first game i played on my kindle.

B000Q67876|5.0|This is a great movie. To think this movie comes from a short story by Stephen King is kind of amazing. This is easily Tim Robbins best role.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a fantastic contemporary adaptation of the classic series that will leave you on the edge of your seat, gasping for more.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I have not finished the book, but already I am intrigued by Taubes science and research. Well written, well documented.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This album is epic music from start to finish, it seems like Two Steps From Hell get better and better each time I listen to them.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie has great special effects, but it is far too long with no real story line. Predictible and never really got me involved.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|A great way to start off our Christmas season.  Has worked out really well.  A bit pricy but that comes with the territory.

B000GFLAI0|1.0|As bad as \\"Love and Theft\\" was, this is worse, much worse.  In fact, it doesn't even compare favorably with the much maligned \\"Down in the Groove\\", considered by many to be Dylan's absolute nadir.<br /><br />If this album had been released in the mid to late 80s, it would have trashed alongside the rest of his dubious achievements in that decade.  How, then, can Amazon reviewers and people in the music press (including Rolling Stone) rank this album up alongside Dylan's best work of the mid to late 60's?  It's utterly absurd!<br /><br />This album, in no way, deserves upwards of 4 stars. That is sheer lunacy.  Plagarism aside (and it abides throughout this record), the songs, the arrangements, and the performances are lackluster at best.  As bad as his singing truly is at this point, that is NOT the worst feature of this album.  His ragged voice could be overlooked if the material was good.  It isn't.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this album.  I fully expected to in the wake of the monumental reviews.<br /><br />Don't believe them.  This blows....and not in the wind.
0345803485|5.0|It was a book I could not put down. I truly enjoyed reading it. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a love story.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|I can understand the overly enthusiatic reviews of this album when it first came out.  I was pleasantly surprised by it as well.  But it hasn't aged well.  I just listened to again twice today and there are only a small handful of good songs on it (Tweedle Dee, Mississippi, High Water, and Honest with Me).  The rest of it is God-awful, especially his corny retreads of 1920's era Tin Pan Alley crap.  I don't mind that kind of music (especially as it's presented on \\"Boardwalk Empire\\") but in the hands of Dylan and his wretched voice, it's just tedious.  The fact that people here at Amazon have rated \\"Love and Theft\\" on the same level as Freewheelin', Highway 61 Revisited, John Wesley Harding and Bringing It All Back Home is a travesty.<br /><br />The two albums that preceded \\"Love and Theft\\", namely Time Out of Mind and World Gone Wrong, helped set the stage for the overly effusive praise of this album.  Those two records were superb and most of us didn't believe that Dylan still had that much creativity left (both as a song-writer on the former and as a perfomer on the latter).  \\"Love and Theft\\" benefited from the extreme good will left over from those 2 albums.  But, despite a decent effort by Bob, \\"Love and Theft\\" didn't rise to the same level. And the plagarism that Dylan has always practiced somewhat discretely in the past became egregious on this and his 3 follow-ups (Modern Times, Together Through Life, and Tempest).  At this stage, he seems be saying to his fans: \\"Why Bother?\\".<br /><br />Trust me....this isn't a 5-star album!  Not even close.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I really enjoy all of these Step Up movies!  They keep your interest throughout the movie.  The dance moves are unbelievable at times.  How can they move like that?  The CD arrived in great shape.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally could not put this down and I saw the movie first so knew what was going to happen. Fantastic writing!
B004529NKC|5.0|I enjoy all these movies.  The acrobatic dance moves are something to see.  The DVD arrived in great shape!  I'm waiting for the next movie!
B00005K3NR|5.0|lol totally forgot about travolta being in this movie, the sequals dont compare, if your into older horror movies that dont just include graphic violence but more so based on actors and their acting skills, this is one I would recommend.

B004SIP9MY|5.0|I got all three for the collection and i had to re buy the first one cause the 3 collectors series and the first one easily broke on me but this one is worth it, my cuzo use to be big into this and i wasnt really ever sure until i full saw it for myself and john carpenter did a very good job with this one, for any horror fan, id recommend this title easily.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love the slow burn of this love story. Set during the rise of the industrial age in England, it follows Margaret Hale, whose father has moved the family to Northern England for a fresh start. You would think from her reaction to the people and events around her that Margaret has entered another world, but she is eager to learn the ways of the people there and make an impression and an impact on those she comes into contact with.<br /><br />This character drama is full of longing looks, catty and witty banter, misunderstandings and heaving bodices that we've come to expect in a British period drama. The acting is superb and perfectly cast. Even Mr. Bates from Downton Abbey plays a part.<br /><br />If you love British period drama, you'll love North & South.
6305841861|5.0|Too simular to the first one but out of the 2, i enjoyed this one much more, love the slap stick bruce brought to horror in this film.
B008602KQI|2.0|Although the acting is fine and the movie is well made, this movie overall is a very poor adaptation of the book. So much has been changed (and much of it needlessly) that it has lost the &#34;soul&#34; of the actualy story and turn it into a slick, glossy Hollywood-style Cliff Notes version of the original.<br /><br />If you never read the book, it may be fine as a popcorn movie. However, if you did read the book ,don't even bother. You will be more irritated than entertained!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Its still good to own the complete series, even if it doesn't have some of the same songs as it did back when it was airing on TV. Still enjoying it in 2014.
B007JMW46U|3.0|Loved being able to read the stories again. However, the illustrations were wonky. They graphics would show up wrongly on the page or superimposed over the text.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|One of my all time favorites, if your into vampire films, this is a movie I'd recommend.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I first read the comic as it was being released and I fell in love with the universe that is Scott Pilgrims world. Game references? check, Likable characters? check. Awesome fights? Double Check. This movie? has all of that and then some.
B004P7CN7W|4.0|Oh man, i remember when this first came out, for its time, it was cool to watch but now that im fully grown, i totally see the major stereo typing in this entire movie, not to mention i totally forgot that elijah wood was in this movie and the fact they had a scene of him and josh hartnett geeking made this movie not only that much better but their are soo many big actors and actresses you see through out the film of their acting careers that it will have your eyes wide open, again its a little corny but its an exception, i felt like i got my moneys worth.
B007XC9BSK|4.0|Cars micro drifter mack transporter case. This item is of excellant quality. This was a Christmas gift,that has not been given yet.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is my favorite holiday movie. It is full of laughs and includes excellent acting. I watch it every year around the holidays.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I have never had a problem with this app on my tablet. Great for tweeting while I am in my bed watching my favorite shows.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Although it takes a bit longer than I would like for my energy to regenerate,  its a fun game. Very addicting.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have to give it a good review bacause I read it in one afternoon.  Very thought provoking.  Medical theories compared to fantasy or religious beliefs.
B007N9FKCY|2.0|The Bean seems to pull to the left on my Galaxy S3 making the game difficult to control.  To me Mario requires more skill and thought than this game and this game quickly loses its appeal.
B001KPYNR0|3.0|I don't think I would have purchased this if I had heard it first.  Some songs I really like and others are just okay.  Maybe it's me but it is difficult to understand the words to her songs.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I know there are some negative reviews about this movie but I don't get it...it's visually stunning, the story is good and the acting is solid. A great follow-up to the original.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Any reader that follows the novels  of Vince Flynn will enjoy the Last Man. Relax, read and enjoy. The Last Man is up to par
B007XC9BSK|1.0|The picture makes you think that the truck is a pretty decent size, but it is not it is very tiny.  It also makes you think that it is going to come with the cars, it says nothing about having to buy them separately. Very Unhappy with this purchase.
B00979CS50|5.0|Bought this for my BF and he thinks it's fantastic. I'm more of a Crazy Horse fan, but he digs Neil Young's creative genius. These songs are loooooooong...so be prepared to take a long drive to hear them all the way through.
B008RTE08E|3.0|The first LP that I ever bought as a teenager, and had to scrape together the last few quarters as it cost  $1.00 more than all the other LPs in 68.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it.  Of course we missed it when it first aired in the states, but it's nice to have it on DVD anyway.
B001EBWING|5.0|I just gave this to my son and his soon to be bride, as it was what my wife and I used to watch when we were dating so long ago.  A little bit of romance is good!<br /><br />&#34;Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she had to walk into mine!&#34; --Rick Blaine
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I have been using eWallet since the early days of the Dell Axiom. Between personal web sites, banking products, and work needs, I have hundreds of cards in eWallet. I think I started with their second revision. There are plenty of password programs that will sync to a file somewhere on the web. I can't understand why anybody would take the risk of letting their password file get out in public like that. Encrypted or not .. it's just a risk that we shouldn't have to take. eWallet allows easy syncing between a computer and a phone (or multiple devices), while making sure the file is never placed on the web, the cloud, a company server, or any other third party device. One of the great features of this program has always been that Illum Software understands that password security requires more than encryption, and designs their product to encourage users to keep their stuff safe.<br /><br />The last time I purchased a version of eWallet was about 3 years ago when I got an Android phone. It worked well, easily syncing between my Windows computer and the Droid. When I got a new Droid phone, I found that I had to upgrade to this version. I was a little ticked at the expense of the upgrade. (Both the Windows computer and the Droid phone needed new software). But I need my passwords, so upgrading was a requirement for me.<br /><br />When I got the new programs, wallets were upgraded and synced without a hitch. A couple of days later, I had time to look at the new programs. The difference is amazing.<br /><br />It used to be that the phone wallet was a password viewer (one couldn't create or edit cards on the phone). Now one can do just just about anything on the phone that can be done on the PC.<br /><br />The new version allows syncing over Wi-Fi. Plugging a USB cable in is hardly a major hassle, but using Wi-Fi is certainly more convenient. Before syncing over Wi-Fi, devices must first be paired by reading a passcode from one and entering it in the other, a wise securityprecaution. I also like that Wi-Fi syncing requires clicking on both the phone and the PC. As Illum suggests in their user document, one should not sync on a public Wi-Fi network for security reasons.<br /><br />Card customization has been dramatically improved and now includes a host of new and useful features. My favorite new feature is field customization. Many of my cards require additional information not in any of the template's fields. I always ended up adding the information to a generic field or putting it in the notes section. This is OK, but these areas don't have much structure and can't be hidden. Now one can create new fields and give them attributes such as hidden, text, numeric, etc. Other potentially useful features are the ability to attach files to a card, subcategories, and shortcuts. The shortcuts feature is worth a few words. Sometimes a card fits in two categories. Illum points out that putting a shortcut in the second category saves memory. That's true, but the better reason for using shortcuts is that changing the master card automatically changes all shortcuts. One doesn't get two different cards for the same purpose, one with new information and one with old.<br /><br />I often don't bother reading the user manual, but I'm glad I took the time to look at Illum's manual for eWallet. It is well written and gives many useful tips. With so many different platforms supported, not all features work on all platforms. The user manual does an excellent job of pointing out where each platform has limitations on a feature.  It is worth your time to go to the Illum site, seek out, and read the user manual.<br /><br />Overall, Illum has done a tremendous job upgrading eWallet. The upgrade still isn't cheap, but there is a great deal of value-added in the new product.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|The movie was enjoy able and cinimatic<br />the story line was good. Some of it was funny but weird<br />I would recomend this to johnny Depp fans and vampire fans
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|its nice idea star wars meets angry birds, but in the end its just another angry birds game, with a really cool theme
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is yet another hit by Baldacci.  I had not picked up a Baldacci novel in a while and I am so sorry that I had not because I was hooked on the first page and could not put it down.  The only negative I can give is that because it is so good, I finished it far too quickly.
0061801313|3.0|Person who received this seems to be happy with it. Can't really evaluate it but was in good condition and was as described
B004TI5N38|5.0|I bought this immediately after I finished Baldacci's The Innocent and whizzed right through this fast-paced and intriguing story.  Puller is the perfect stoic military hero.  I will be purchasing the next one right away.
0880796863|3.0|Person who received this seems to be happy with it. Can't really evaluate it but was in good condition and was as described
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A beautiful and sad story. I read it in one sitting as it is the type of book in which you connect deeply with the characters. A truly remarkable read that's left a long lasting mark on me and had me questioning my own opinions.
B00ADYYY50|1.0|this album is full of lazy beats, production, and rhymes the only good songs of 20 tracks are<br />1. Remember You - awesome single, the weeknd makes this song<br />2. Medicated - good<br />3. Got Everything<br />4. Initation<br />5. It's Nothin<br />other songs like paperbond, work hard play hard, and the track featuring akon are the worst
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|I have gained a new perspective and something that challenges my views. Great movie about sushi but much more than that is the philosophy.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you have a great TV, and love to take advantage of your pixels and see great special effects get this movie.  One of the best to get on Blueray.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|LOVE IT  LOVE IT!!  I even have family and friends reading it too! It has everything from sci fy to romance to murder mystery. Really keeps you guessing!!
B003AQBWRQ|5.0|We appreciated that it included an advent wreath and a creche.  We have an advent calendar made of wood which has boxes that can be opened for each day in advent.  We put pieces of the Christmas room in each box so that the room is coming together gradually.  The kids are enjoying the assembling of parts.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Very soulful.  I love #2, #6, #8.  There is always one to three songs on Alicia's CDs that I really like and these are the ones.  She never disappoints me!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I'm no where near being a teenager anymore and yes some things are a bit hokey but for this most part this is an entertaining murder mystery series with lots of surprises. The girls are all super talented. I love it. Can't wait until it comes back in January!
B0000026A8|5.0|This is my favorite jazz album of all time.  A common complaint about jazz by non-fans is that it is too difficult to understand, with too much improvisation and not enough tunage.  To these people I offer this masterpiece as a rebuttal.  This album is not only musically impressive, it's also *fun.* I have never had more fun with a jazz tune than with the opener for this album, \\"Better Git It in Your Soul.\\"  The rest of \\"Mingus Ah Um\\" is full of energy too.  Even if you hate jazz, you should at least get this.  If you are interested in getting into jazz this is good place to start.  And if you already like jazz then you have this already.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|After only 2 months, the piece that connects to the kindle broke! Poorly made. I do not suggest buying this.
B00014X8KO|5.0|\\"Memories\\" is what other anime movies should aspire to be.  It is genuine creativity with flashes of true genius.  It is technically an anthology movie, three short movies squashed together (why don't more movies do this?).  The three shorts are: \\"Magnetic Rose\\" which tells of a future deep space salvage crew exploring a creepy space station and dealing with the ghost of its former inhabitant, \\"Stinkbomb\\" which is a hilarious satire on human stubbornness and stupidity, and \\"Cannon Fodder\\" which portrays a society constantly at war that serves as an overall statement on the human condition.  I enjoyed all three shorts immensely and was able to take something away from all of them.  I really enjoy anime anthology movies, actually - \\"Labyrinth Tales\\" (released in the US as \\"Neo Tokyo\\") is also really good (and also involves Katsuhiro Otomo), and I'm still waiting for \\"Robot Carnival\\" to be released here (ha. hahaHAHAHA!).<br /><br />This DVD is pretty good, with good video and sound along with a featurette about the making of the movie.  Anyone into anime, animation in general or just good, creative filmmaking should buy this DVD.
B0013V2UU8|5.0|If you wanna build houses or roofed structures with legos, you need roof tiles. This is a way to get roof tiles without spending money for a whole creator set. it also can combine with other color roof tile from your existing sets to get great looks by mixing colors. It's lego it's good. buy it...
B000UJ48WC|4.0|There is much discussion elsewhere on 'The Shining' in terms of plot summary, acting, and value so I won't get into that. My reviews are strictly regarding the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray .<br /><br />The Shining displays a beautiful video transfer with natural colorizations showing off Kubrick's wonderful lens craft and cinematography. There was no unnatural grain, artifacts or aliasing to be found. The video transfer was exceptionally done.<br />The film begins to play as soon as you put the disc in and the audio defaults to DD 5.1 . You will need to go to the menu to switch the audio to PCM 5.1  lossless audio. It does make a big difference. However, the audio transfer really only uses the front stage and there is very little use of any discreet audio to either the rear channels or from the LFE channel. The front stereo separation is good but, except for the film's music score, this is still a dialogue driven film so don't expect much from your surround system. The video transfer remains the star. The movie is getting on in years but it holds up and has legs, just wish they had put as much effort into remastering the audio as they did with the fine video transfer.<br /><br />The Shining does come with plenty of supplementary extras and a large variety of language choices. The extras, I found to be worthwhile and interesting..most dated at 2007. Thankfully, there were no advertisement trailers for other movies.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B009CPES4I|5.0|You can't beat the cast in the movie, especially Judi Densch.  What a great movie to watch again and again.
B0052YAKS6|3.0|CD case was missing a chunk of the cover on top left side. Removed packing and the whole lid came off so I cant close the CD case. CD itself was in good condition.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I enjoyed the first two Batman movies and had nothing but anticipation for the last in the trilogy. I was surprised how disengaged I was after the first 15 minutes of the film. I forced myself to finish watching it. Maybe my expectations were too high? I have no idea but this movie failed to deliver whatever it was that made the first two films entertaining. Update: To more specific: the movie was boring and barely kept my attention. I wanted to cut it off after the first 45 minutes. The villain was not very interesting to me either and the mask with him talking through it sounded odd and I never got used to it at all. Didn't care for Anne Hathaway's character either. Stereotypical character - clever girl who can kick ass and doesn't know which side she's on, yeah, I've seen it before. Christian Bale, still looks good but that's about all he did in here: look good. I had to ask my co-worker who enjoyed this movie (she saw it twice!) what she liked about it. She was deeply moved at the end, the part on the bridge was mentioned but she did admit the story was lackluster. Despite a few entertaining moments in the film, it wasn't enough to make me recommend this anybody. Rent it if you must see it. I wish I had. (Truly wish I had rented this movie, it was not very entertaining for me).
B00633W614|1.0|I really enjoyed book one and was looking forward to the sequel. Sadly, it was nowhere near as good and I had to push to finish it (being on a long haul flight helped).
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Great story, superb acting, charming characters, witty British humor.<br />I watch it every year around the holidays and never tire of this charming film.<br />I hope that you enjoy it too.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|As a child of the 80s, I LOVE this movie, but seeing it again as an adult brings to mind one thought: Trying to introduce this movie to an adult significant other that hasn't seen it is not usually a great idea.  While you may remember all the parts that make this movie a true cult classic, and your kids may enjoy the one liners and action involved, an adult may look at you like you've lost your mind.<br /><br />That being said, I still LOVE this movie and will continue to quote lines from it until I am 80 years old.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It's really not as bad as people on here are saying.  It does jump cut a lot.  However, I invite you to go to youtube and view some older Zeppelin concerts on there.  I found them to be just as jump cutting.  The difference is with this one it is literally like a second quicker and that, I think, makes a difference.  I found mydelf saying, I need another moment to fully absorb that image.  That being said it's not that bad and enjoyable to watch.  I would definately recommend the version with the footage.<br />As for the concert: it holds up.  Page seems a smidgen off at times where he comes in a bit late or a bit early or misses the intricacies of a note or chord (a hammer or bend or slide) here and there at times.  But that's Page!<br />Honestly it's really good.  Plant's voice still got it.  Actually hits those highs but misses a few of the lows.  He makes up for any misses though by adding some melody and quaver to his singing.<br />John Paul Jones is spot on perfect - nuff said there.<br />Now, your question: How'd Jason Bonham do?  He'd make Dad proud!  I found him to be solid.  Maybe he missed some of Dad's menacing flourishes but his drumming was definately the glue to this whole performance.<br />Any Zep fan has to add this to their collection because where Zep lives on eternal and where Zep really shines is Zep live.  And we have far too few Zep live shows.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great! I can't wait to see the rest of the season! May be the best season so far. I highly recommend.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my uncle who ended up leaving my aunt before Christmas so he never received the movie I however enjoy this movie.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|This book jumps quite a bit, not really a cook book, wish it focused more on just cooking. Thought it was going to be more like Alton Brown, this book was just not my style. I suggest borrowing before buying.
B0049VZ222|5.0|The characters are good, the plot is better, and the production value and special effects are top notch!  Even my wife enjoys it and she doesn't like gore.
1444728911|5.0|I love everything that John Grisham write!  I am such a big fan.  I usually read his books in one or two settings...<br />The Accused was no exception.  I loved it!!!<br />Patricia Lasarte
B00062PN6I|5.0|I teach group piano and I have been very pleased with these headphones for my students.  A good buy on a decent pair of headphones.
0792163710|4.0|I thought the movie was the best.I was born & raised in Jackson,Wyoming ,where this was filmed.I knew a lot of the local people in the cast. I also got to see some of it filmed.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Great entertainment! I'm a scifi fan and this appeals to me... scifi plus humor and a bit of craziness make for a great pic
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Anyone-everyone would love this book. It's so heart warming and .....I loved it. It made me cry. I thought that the quotes or the tiny poems were so ....what's the word? To be honest I love  it more than the hunger games.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Hahahahaha. Best. Line. Ever. I have never been completely stopped in my tracks by a movie. Very versatile movie, appropriate for folks gathered around for the holidays or just hanging out.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|This card holder was a little bigger than I expected, but it did it's job as a card holder. Not only did the product said as promised but it sure saved me a lot more money I would have spent on \\"plastic cases\\" for each individual card. I like that it also holds both SD, and MicroSD cards. Both of which I use for photography, video, and storage.<br /><br />Overall, this product is the best and cheapest you will find. It may not be a essential for those without more then two cards, if you have more than two. Please get this product, the shipping was fast, the gift wrapping option was great. I only wished it came with a washable marker, making it easier to organize and rename.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I thought Shia could have had a more bad ass character, especially when his brother got hurt and when his best friend was murdered.<br />I would recommend this to others
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn's novels and this one is just as appealing with a plot that seems even more potentially realistic than his previous books. Anyone who likes intriguing spy novels with a strong lead character will enjoy this book and all the other books in the Mitch Rapp series.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I need a loud alarm clock to wake up and this alarm clock is perfect for this.  It allows you to pick different alarm sounds too which my last alarm clock didn't.  I'm glad I decided to give this app a try.  It's a keeper. I couldn't ask for more.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this is the second time I have had this game. both times the app has had a major flaw that prevents play. the first time I got to level 56 and my game reset itself to level 1. the second time I played it on the kindle and got to level 46 and now the app won't even open. it would be a fun game if you could play it but its too unreliable until these glitches are fixed. I am uninstalling again...

B005V4FJC4|1.0|The whole cd sounded like a warbled washed old tyme record you'd hear in a horror dream sequence in a movie. I like new versions of my old favorite Christmas songs but their version really ruined it for me. I have no clue how they thought this was good!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|not so great storytelling.  While visually ParaNorman was a fantastic movie, it just liked the &#34;fun&#34; or &#34;excitement&#34; of other movies such as Coraline.  The story set up and parallels between Norman and the witch is truly heart felt, however what the movie had in animation chops it lost in entertainment value.
B002KYGLVQ|3.0|One message of the movie, which to me seemed to center around the evil of dictatorial control of a society and the bravery required to rescue that society, did come through.  But one would have to assume that it was even possible for England to sink to that level.  Given that the IRA fought the British over a much more benign type of political control, I rather doubt that the UK citizens could ever allow the country to become a dictatorship -- I believe it would be nipped in the bud early on.  Yes, every-day folk can become tools of a Big Brother dictatorship.  History has taught us that.  Hopefully, though, we have learned from history.  To the extent that you believe that, the premise of the movie is over the top.

B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|A bit disappointing. The map is huge and the games graphics are pretty good. Only thing is that I beat the game on my first try and only saw slendy once. sometimes I would just start turning around and I would randomley pick up a page. there is even a place where there are about 4 pages right next to each other. this game would be good if the pages were more scattered and the chances of seeing slendy increased each time u got a page like on the computer. I hope this will be applied on to the next chapter. PEACE OUT

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love loved loved it can't wait to read the third one!<br />Written very well. Sensual, exciting, couldn't put it down.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|GREAT SERIES! LOVED EVERY BOOK. Would reccommend to anyone who loves a good story, It takes a few chapters to get into it and get the characters and storyline set up but worth the the effort.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book is highly recommended by its excellent style of writing, a adventure of romance and excitement, and of course, you should check out the continuous never ending creator of the Percy Jackson series, Rick Riordan!
B007UWBQEU|3.0|I feel like she is yelling in a few of the songs, it isn't one of those 'every song is a number one' feeling kind of album but it is fun to listen to, I wish I would of just bough the songs that made it on the radio individually.
B0053O89IS|3.0|I was not very involved in any of the episodes.  By involved, meaning, take eight to twelve hours and watch the entire season in one sitting, becuase I could not wait to see what occurred in the next episode.  I found the plots predictable, the characters predictable, the resolutions predictable.  I love the series, and have them all on DVD.  Recommending you wait until the price goes down, then purchase.  Not worth the full price I paid.<br /><br />And...what happened to all the episodes????  Far fewer amount in season 7.  What the...?!?!?!?
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A little slower then the rest of the books but still a good read. I don't want to read it to fast bcause I am bummed that I have to wait for the next one.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is my first Jack Reacher novel, Lee Childs first also. This is great escapist fun if you like your protagonist, intelligent and violent, your story a bit unbelievable but fast paced and your writers capable of incomplete yet acceptable sentences. I couldn't put it down.
B005XLN7EC|5.0|It has been purchased for my granddaughter for Christmas so it is wrapped under the tree for her to open.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|After the initial sign in with the inbox updating,  this app would no longer load new emails. I deleted the app and will just use my web browser on my Kindle Fire for getting hotmail.
1400069289|5.0|I am  still reading it, but it's so interesting. i love the stories in it  and the way it's written.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|finally a way to control things and I can understand it<br />thanks for the app....I am a simple person who needs straight forward
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Albom always entertains. I have read a number of his books and enjoyed them very much. I love that he leaves me with something to think about which is always out side of my current circumstance.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|its loaded and in wait..i have a lot of books to read and love that this is offered for free
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is definitely over the top with its drama. It's so well done tho, I'm not sure I could stop watching it.
B000002N25|5.0|Everybody knows this album is dripping with an Irish/Cajun flavor if that is even a proper classification..It's an awesome effort i'm sure he's proud off,having listened to it regularly for 7 years now,I can say it's well worth the money..what I really wanna know is,what is the story behind the necklace on the cover..? would love to have one to give my \\"Darling Pretty\\"..!
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I felt like this album should have been better then what it was. The first album I was in love it, every song I loved. This album had a few ok songs, but the rest was just uninteresting. I mean I loved \\"Locked out of heaven\\" and \\"When I was your man\\" and \\"Treasure. I'm a huge fan of Bruno, but Unorthodox Jukebox was ok for me.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Glad that I got to test out this great game before buying the full version. I enjoyed it tremendously!  The pac-pad worked smoothly and there's a volume control.  After clearing the first screen the game gets a bit faster, so too, my heart was like beating more quickly. (ha-ha) But hey, it's not like I'm nine anymore. Enjoy!
159420411X|5.0|This should be required reading by all US citizens, especially those in positions of responsibility. His realistic assessment of the way to evaluate  assumptions and predictions based on data surrounding situations of all types, has to be very instructive and useful regardless of your level of understanding of the statistics and mathematics involved
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really like it. It works well for me. I can look at and edit documents on my kindle fire, then find them on on desktop computer. It works well and I haven't encountered any issues with this app.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I recently wrote a post on one of the related Kindle forums I go on and recommended this game (among others) on the best ones to stock up on if you buy your kids a new Kindle Fire for Christmas. I bought it for my Mac and I play it constantly. There are so many levels, and it's very challenging. You might put it down for awhile, but it's one of those games you'll keep coming back to. The soundtrack is awesome too.
0345803485|5.0|Great book for a fun read. Not literature at it's best, but definitely an entertaining, arousing, and engaging read. I bought the second and third too!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best superhero films of all times as well as great ensemble story telling. Larger than life characters that are compelling and fun to watch. The Hulk finally done RIGHT! heroic and scary at the same time. Thank you Joss Whedon for not making the hulk a childlike innocent but a true force of nature that may save you or kill you.<br /><br />The &#34;Tracking shot&#34; during finale was superb and looked just like a panel from a comic book.<br /><br />Mr Whedon has set the bar very high here
6304806434|4.0|My husband looked high and low for this movie, across town, across the county, but couldn't find this rare gem. He was thrilled to get it. Fast service too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It's the classic solitaire game that is just enough of a challenge to keep you happy.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Raunchy buddy flic with a funny concept and some humerious situations and lines.  Not very well acted but good special effects.
1451695195|5.0|There are lots of books on this theme and i've read them all, but the credentials of this person in particular, just leave no place for doubt. I'm happy for having contacted with such a reality as the one that DR.EBEN ALEXANDER tells us about.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|One of my favorite authors, the Bones books are wonderful....I wait very impatiently for her books to be released...also fell in love with her teen series...look for it!!
0307951529|5.0|I don't enjoy marketing books but this one was interesting, fun and had lots of wonderful, motivating information. I will be able to use it in my new endeavors.
