B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book! I read it in two days, couldn't put it down! It was the most perfect ending!
B004H1U2HE|4.0|Makes you think. Interesting both as far as his describing of his family legend and world history. The way he describe his caracters is very different and allmost breathtaking. Even rather long, it is so worth reading.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My daughter is five and she loves all the Dr panda games.she gets so excited when i find a news one for her. I highly recommend this game for those with small children.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|First saw her perform on the Tonight Show. She is a great artist. Most of the songs she either wrote or cowrote. This cd has been played enough to wear it out. Beautiful lady, Beautiful voice!
B003G4W49C|5.0|...books I've.  I read the original many years ago, but reading his new forward and introduction added a much needed context to an already very interesting, enjoyable, and thought-provoking book.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|I really hate when you get a game and you are limited to just the basics and have to purchase the next level. Even though this was put on my Kindle for my 3 year old Granddaughter, she got bored with it the first night because you can do so little.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I am so thankful, it is still there. I want my grandchildren to see that .... well, not yet. They're still 2 (two kids) and 6 years old. A big thank you. :D
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Intervention please!! Watched the entire season in 3 days!! I'm a sonsaholic for sure!!! Definitely recommend this show. Just make sure you have time to keep going!!
B000RHG4XS|5.0|I am a fan of originals but i must say i loved this one more than the first one (kind of).
B00C32R64G|5.0|His voice.  The music.  The slight variation in style between songs.  Track 8 sucks just because its the (thankfully, one and only) song with the screamy, growly, death metal vocals that I hate.  If you buy the CD, you get the MP3 version right away.  I recommend this even if you have to pay shipping.  It's worth getting the CD-only track.  Best song on this album.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|I ballroom dance and this is a classic for those of use who do ballroom dance. It has it's share of raunchyness to it as well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This must be a must read for anybody who has the slightest curiosity about life and  why we're on this earth! I recommended it highly.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Found to be quite adequate does lose a minute after a week or so.  I love the style and comfort great quality since the price is equal to any battery operated timex.
0882847953|5.0|A necessary study for the serious drummer. This book looks like a cream puff, but presents real challanges when studied with serious intentions.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I wonder if anyone who actually works for Amazon knows how annoying it is to see an update prompt when you open the Facebook app on the Kindle Fire HD ? I'm sure Kindle owners everywhere know that it is completely ridiculous that upon clicking the update button you are redirected to the Google Play Store. Speaking of the Google Play Store, we already shelled out hundreds of dollars for our devices, why not give us access to Play? Would Amazon not be able to make enough money? I'm quite sure that your profits would not suffer by offering more content for what many consider to be the best Android tablet on the market.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This author challenges =conventional= wisdom and supports his premises with facts, figures and real life peoples' stories. If the =powers that be= running the educational system in America read this book and applied subsequent principles, ours would be a very different country.
0307352153|3.0|Some good insights in this book. The author relied on conjecture, that's all right as long as you define it as that. Pop culture tries to define who is to be looked up to and what is &#34;cool&#34;. Who's behind Pop culture any way? Answer that<br />And maybe every thing else will fall into place.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I LOVE this movie!!  Gerald Butler is awesome...Emily's voice is amazing!!  And even though she didn't sing the opera parts...Minnie Driver played a perfect &#34;diva&#34;.  The music is so beautiful...even though I know the ending I still always hope while I am watching  that she ends up with the Phantom!!  I have seen this movie a thousand times and will watch it a thousand more!!
B008MWBY6W|2.0|Strap was broken in 2 days of use so I had to return it. Many people have same issue so looks like common problem otherwise it was nice
B006DHAT5K|1.0|absolutely not. I put this DVD into my player and it just made a loud noise and did not work. I am very disappointed and have no idea how to return in. I've never had this issue before with amazon. the DVD itself looked horrible, most of the writing on it was crossed out with permanent marker.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I love Linkin Park. I love just about all of their albums. This is one of them! When Chester and Mike work together their work is amazing. They compliment each other, and one with out the other is just not as great.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|You have enough characters and sub-plots to keep anyone guessing and interested. The family dynamics are such that I believe everyone can relate to many of the good and bad power plays.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Probably one of the best movies of this generation.  Worthy of watching again.  It's difficult to understand how this movie didn't win any awards when it first came out.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Nice features, run silently in background if wanted or can be turned off. But when is somebody going to make an eq with more than 5 bands.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Like all of Picoult`s books, this book is filled with many emotions. I felt Gus` pain a n d worry as a Mother. I could not put th I s book down until I knew the fate of the characters.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed the characters, the writing was visual. The story was romantic. It was a good summer read. I would read more by this author
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as I love witches & vampires,it could of had a liitle more plot but I really did enjoy all the action,exspecially Jeremy Renner! I think everyone else would like it to. TY
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|IMy grandson and I watch this ogether, he is fivse years old. We had so much fun. He recognized the similiar music to Star Wars and enjoyed seeing Yoda on Halloween,
B005LAII44|5.0|Loved the movie as I do Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock,also Bruce Willis great action which I LOVE a lot,only thing was missing was more Channing Tatum,but otherwise it was great & would recommend anyone to see. TY
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Hilarious movie.<br />I can't believe I didn't own it until now.<br />The extras on the bluray are great too, deleted scenes are so funny!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|Delivery was great,was a little disappointed in the movie,I believe they could have made it much better as it seemed to drag out and not enough plot to it. TY
B009RX85N0|5.0|I preorder it and it arrived to Mexico one day after the release. Here we don't have it yet.<br /><br />I've been waiting to watch again season 2, now I can't wait for season 3 :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game it has more twist than a snake I enjoyed every momemt ispent playing it. would enjoy more games like this
B000JIHP88|5.0|very colorful really cute chararters fast shipping really cute I knowmy baby will enjoy it nicest one I have found
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We are so happy that we found this series and...that there are at least 3 seasons!  Some may call this a soap opera because it keeps wanting you to come back for more.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|It's not all I was looking for but it's ok if it really bored. It is difficult to control the plane and even harder to control the gun. Thank God their are missiles but only a few of the planes have them.  All in all its an ok game.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Truly gripping!  It was very hard to put down!  Brilliantly written and a fitting sequel to Ender's Game.  Highly recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have a higher-end wireless router than the average person at home, a Cisco 881w. Chromecast will not work with it because UPnP support is required, but Cisco routers do not support it.<br /><br />Be aware if you have an old router or a more business-class router that Chromecast will only work if it supports UPnP, check it out before you buy one if you are unsure.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|I am not a fan of most horror stories, but this one captivated me.  It was impossible not to watch (with some compassion) the life of the murderer unfold, and the story built to an unexpected ending -- unexpected but somehow right.  Great cast, solid performances, an amazing period piece, richly textured, and informative.  I will watch it again, but not too soon.  Five stars for me.
B00DQVST76|2.0|I do hope the sycophants who wrote glowing reviews on this page for this concert were paid like the ones featured in the mosh pit on this concert DVD!  Otherwise, our society is in far greater peril than the enlightened ones previously thought!  This is a very noisy, over-produced, choppy mesh of a concert.  It was dark, creepy, almost eerily icky in nature--like watching an aging Moulin Rouge tart cavorting about with youngsters in some creepy Stephen King horror concert movie. (Almost camp, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show.)  There are a few very good dance numbers in a couple of presentations, and one must credit Madonna for staying in shape and keeping at it, but as far as an entertaining, fun and light-spirited concert event goes, forget it.  Not at all a light-hearted fun filled event like the Confessions Tour, this concert was just a slick mess of noisy over-produced lip-synched electronic schlock.  Sad to think Madonna has come to this level of desperation.
1451648545|2.0|I don't understand why the cover for the paperback version is different than the hardcover version. Is it to capitalize on the motion picture starring Ashton Kutcher?
B005K17RU0|5.0|enjoy using this app. easy to use and fast response. reliable local weather report. good graphs and maps. highly recommend.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Will not install but continues to take more space each attempt until no space is left. Complete waste of time.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is a very helpful guide and it is easy to follow,  Screen shots are especially useful, I recommend it,
B000RVK1AQ|5.0|A great movie if you like a little supernatural in your films.  Nicolas Cage is once again brilliant and the supporting actors are memorable.  One of the better movies I've watched this year.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|This book was wonderful to read but parts of it were overcome with detail.  Lincoln was an amazing president and an even better man.  I like history but this was even too much for me.  I learned a lot about a very sad chapter in our nation's history.
1848313470|4.0|got this for a friend and he has not stopped talking about it! I'm told its a good read and interesting
B000A6T1HC|5.0|I'm not an opera buff, so I can't comment knowledgeably about things like &#34;authenticity&#34; or compare this work to other performances and recordings.  That said, I  found this CD absolutely mindblowing, full of a passionate overflowing exuberance that I had never associated with the baroque.  There are exquisite arias on traditional religious themes like All'arme si accesi guerrieri (in sum, put down your weapons, Christ is born) or  Disseratevi, oported'Averno from The Resurrection , so overpowering that it seems that the force of the muxic and the singer's voice alone woul batter down the gates of Hell.<br />Wild metaphysical forays by Handel like Un pensiero..., where in five dazzling minutes we contemplate the beginning and the end of time, the strings playing with frenetic urgency and Ms Bartoli's voice matching their cascading riffs, doing things that  I did not know<br />a human voice could do - I've played it already a dozen times and there is one place in it that I cannot hold back a smile of wonder.
B00845PT18|3.0|Not as good as the first one (surprise huh?).  They completely changed the origin story from the first movie.  I'm not sure if that's because the origin story was different in the comics or what, but I prefer the first to this one.  Still, a good story and the acting is good.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie bored me to tears and is not even worth the 15 words required to rate it at! Don't waste your time...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome. obviously better than temple run. there needs to be a temple run 4 5 6,  ect. Lol. keep it up imangi studios.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|I was interested in the movie when it came out, but it has lots more fighting than I expected and a very basic plot.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|KT is always a joy, and this album is exceptional. I anxiously await her future efforts. Check her out, you won't be disappointed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is the best! I  never lose interest and I feel like this goals don't take a millennium to complete.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun enjoy the game however bate the greed of the creators always trying to scam more money out of us for a free game
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|ONE OF THE GREATEST SHOWS TO EVER BEHOLD THIS PLANET NOW IN AN AWESOME CONTAINER AND IT IS BLU RAY. COMPLETELY WORTH THE 300 BUCKS. BUY THIS NOW EVEN IF YOU HAVE SEEN EVERY EPISODE.
B001MTENOC|4.0|I especially liked that this book is written by a Dr with Phd. After my own experiences via dreams and visions this book added to my confidence and validated what I know.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I got this app straightaway because I've used Yahoo for 30 years with great success.  However, the Kindle version leaves something to be desired.  First, all my contacts synced fine, but I had 2 of everyone.  There was no way to get to my Contacts folder to delete them or to add anyone new.  This is unacceptable in an email app.  I have deleted it &amp; will use the Kindle email app that came on the device.
0316168815|5.0|This book is so good if you can get past the opening sequences. I put it down and had to go back to it. It is graphic and brutal, but ends up being a beautiful story. The opening still haunts me three years after having read it.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I am sorry to see the show end it has kept me on the edge of my seat with suspense and excitement I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great show
0439806119|5.0|I am really so confused on how Harry Potter and Twilight get made into a series and these have not. This is by far the best series ever written for middle-schoolers and teens. Even all the adults in my family have read them and love them. We inhaled them in three days. Anxiously awaiting the possibility of a movie...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love this series! Can't wait to see the movie. At my age, never thought I would love urban fantasy but I do. I will read anything Cassandra Clare writes!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is my go to get in shape video for summer. It is super challenging and for the first three days I can barely walk. Jillian does not stretch you out enough at the end. I recommend doing more calve and arm stretches than what she does. I also almost always develop a backache in my lower back at the beginning of level three.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|I got this as a free app and did not enjoy it. I let my kids try it out and they spent 20 minutes or so trying their best to figure it out and didn't like it either. It's difficult and unclear what to do. Feels like the start of an app, not something completed.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The graphics are good and the storyline is understandable. It`s a good game to play when you only have a few minutes at a time to relax, otherwise it will cost a lot of money to play for hours at a time.
B0061S073A|5.0|I use this to lock down the kids tablet only allowing them to play the games I want them to play and go places I want them to go. It has the added benefit of not allowing ads to do anything or allow them to purchase any other games (if you set it up that way). When the kids select an ad it errors out and then tries to reload the app. You can set it up so it starts with the tablet as well.<br /><br />It's a small pain to constantly have to add new games to it but it's a small price to pay to know they are locked down. After you add apps it places them at the bottom of the list until you re-enter the app, so the kids can find the new apps easy.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|good game it's mind blowing makes you think really hard and concentrate on every little thing and study the concept
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I put this on my sons tablet and he really enjoyed it. At the time it about about the only app he could play he liked. We've since moved on to a different tablet and I realized it had it still, going on the new one ASAP.
1401324649|5.0|I loved this book.  I got through it very quickly and laughed the whole way through.  I wish this guy was my grandpa.  He's awesome.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I wish I could intergrate it with other apps or programs... like a file sharing option between my mac & PC and Andriod, & iPhone... that would be useful
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|i truly enjoyed the book! so funny! I love Tina Fey. But, I have to say, the ending was a bit watered down...it started so strong and then there was no focus..the ending left a lot to be desired. the worse thing is that i know Tina Fey can do so much better
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Some of the technology mentioned in this book is a little dated (the book is a few years old). This book will keep you on your toes.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I found this book to be incredibly sad, repetitious in content and simplistic in style.  It's an easy read, except emotionally.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you are someone who likes very sad stories.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I just like something which is simple and easy to use. This suits me to help with my snaps & photos.
B0053TMP24|3.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. this book has action and fun I love this book
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I like it because it from the past. To learn to begin from past and on. Clothes they wear + horses. The way they lived in the past. Nice HD picture for iPad 1 .
B008469DGY|5.0|I don't play golf games, but this one might just change that. Awesome game with lots of different courses and challenging levels of difficulty.
B004AM5QT4|4.0|I read a lot of Follett becasue he is a superb story teller. Third Twin presents Ken Follett in a different light and is a testament to his ability to be, in my mind, one of the most versatile authors of our times. I liked Third Twin for this very reason and also that it was a refreshing version of the stories and themes in the genetic engineering scene.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Oria returns along here her friends to defeat evil and free the lost souls. Seal creates a wonderful world filled with magic, mystical creatures, shape-shifters and then cleverly weaves American Indian culture into her tale. I did read the first book, Beyond Bridalveil Fall and I have to say that Seal's imagination is beyond comprehension. This is a true YA read but fun for all ages. I highly recommend that you take the journey with Oria and her friends as they prepare to battle against Ala and rid him, once and for all, from their realm!
1936608898|3.0|I thought the book had a lot of good information.  It's basically the gluten-free casein-free diet stepped up a notch.  One thing I think the book should have mentioned in the beginning is that going \\"cold turkey\\" can cause some digestive upset.  I think it would have been more prudent for the authors to have a gradual program where you ease into the diet change.  All of my family ended up with diarrhea, stomach cramping, headaches, etc. when we went on the diet \\"cold turkey\\".  I have recommended the diet change to others, but I have suggested they only remove one food at a time.  Just like with babies you introduce a new food every 3-5 days, I recommended they remove a food every 3-5 days and replace it with a fruit/vegetable until their diet has eliminated the things you shouldn't have.  When we stopped consuming the food, we felt better.  My son started gaining focus / attention.  He is ADHD.  We've only been on the diet change 3 weeks, and I can already tell a difference.  But the first couple of weeks we felt horrible because of what I determined later was \\"withdrawal\\" from gluten / casein.  Long term I'm not sure how we're going to be grain-free and legume-free, but we try to be as much as possible.  But I do want my kids to be normal and have a piece of pizza with their friends (GF/CF of course).  And peanut butter is a great source of protein.  My son practically lives on the stuff.<br /><br />*******<br /><br />UPDATE:  I read the section after they present the medical \\"sciency\\" benefits of the diet change, and that is where the book talks about variations in the diet where those with certain medical conditions should do it gradually.  It also talks about the things you will see digestively with the diet change.  So the information is in the book.  I now would recommend that my friends read the book in its entirety before starting the diet change.  I had already started a GF/CF/SF diet with my son at the recommendation of his therapists, so I have to admitthat I was reading this book in parallel with making the diet changes.  For those who have children with ASD, ADD, ADHD, or SPD, you will probably sympathize & empathize with jumping in with both feet to try to help your child - even if it is somewhat prematurely done in an effort to make up for lost time.  When your child's behavior and sensory issues are interfering with their ability to progress with therapy, you become desperate.  :)
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is not some cheap rip off trying to make money.  It is actually like the Pc and us quite fun for slender fans.
0385349947|5.0|This is all I can say, read it. If you want to have a career, this is the book to give you hope and courage!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game glad I got this one. Love all search and find games. Can`t gat enough of these games.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Re-makes are always on thin ice, as they are required to meet or exceed the expectations of their predecessor.<br /><br />Dredd did a good job of this with Karl Urban leading the role. Good plot, good acting, good movie. Action sequences were well intermingled with appropriate dialog.
B003VA3JUO|5.0|Good movie. Kept me interested in it and thats a hard thing to do. Not many movies I like but this one was good.
B000089RW0|5.0|Love this movie!!!!! I received it very promptly. Couldn't ask for a better scary movie. Even my boyfriend loved. It!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great show! Very slick and creative how they've written it. Being a Friends fan and considering THAT the best comedy ever (sorry Seinfeld fans) I have to admit that this is up there.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This App is great!  I have had a horrible time getting my son out of bed in the morning for school.  He would always give me the excuse that his alarm did not go off because he would shit it off immediately.  Now he actually has to think before shutting it off, so I no longer get that excuse.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Here's another example of an amazing movie. This movie, like 'Dark Knight', are entertaining from beginning to end. Great story and the cast was very good as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is truly revolutionary for its size and what its POTENTIAL can be. People are so quick to down it for only having a few services, but this is just the beginning. I'm using Google Play Movies and Music so much more now. Love this lil' bugger.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I really don't see what all the hype is about this movie. Reminds me of movies like 'Mystic River' or 'Place Beyond the Pines' where they are overhyped and it turns out to be just an average flick. If you want an average film with an obvious plot, go for it.
0812550706|5.0|I've read this book a couple of times before.  Back when I first joined the navy, being a young guy, I wasn't much into reading.  But one of the civilians that I worked with, a retired vet, really pushed this book onto me.  So he loaned me his original paperback print to read.  Of course I was extremely careful with it, due to it's rarity.  But dear god, I feel in love with the store.  I ordered this because I wanted to read it again as it had been years.<br /><br />I wish I could have found a larger print, or even a hard copy as this book is very small. Makes reading and flipping the pages difficult, but it still doesn't take away from what an amazingly classic story this is.<br /><br />I really hope the movie does it justice.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Can't give enough praise to Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker! I've had a few friends who don't like super hero movies fall in love with this movie just because of his performance. Sad loss.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|this signal booster works great. I don't even use my built in wifi on my laptop anymore. picks up 5 bars signal from long distances
B003I7BBZ0|5.0|Good product for kids<br />Beautiful designs<br />My kid love it , thats why I bought another 2 groups<br />I recommend it
B008469DGY|5.0|If you are looing for a simple, easy to pick and play game, you should give this one a look. It's extremely easy to control, and doesn't take up a lot of time. You will find yourself playing it quite a bit.
0399159347|3.0|I must begin my \\"review\\" of \\"The Husband's Secret\\" by saying that I did not think much of this book. This is \\"Chic Lit\\" pure and simple. But I was struck with a kind of a light and nebulous message that sort of hovered around in the shadows of the narrative that appealed to the reader to try to always remain present in their own  lives. The two most important words in everyone's repertoire should be \\"PAY ATTENTION\\". The past is just that and the future is not certain for any of us, so it definitely serves one well to concentrate on the day at hand. With this sentiment, I am able to reluctantly award this one 3 stars.<br /><br />But, truthfully, that is not why I am here. As I started to peruse the reviews posted on this site I became alarmingly appalled at the **SPOILERS** that so many contain. I will never figure out why people feel compelled to include so much information in their reviews. \\"The Husband's Secret\\" is a book (such as it is) that is totally vulnerable to being spoiled. So, just in this case, I am a frequent reviewer, and I love to read and to write Amazon reviews, DON'T READ THEM. If you want to read this book, and receive the full impact of it, just dive in, COLD! The first 2 reviews on the site are particularly offensive. I feel that every author, and definitely every reader, deserves to have a fair shot. Read the book if you are so inclined....but don't spoil your experience with all of the **SPOILERS**!
0345529057|5.0|I have not watched the cable series but the books were recommended to me.  Began reading the first book and was immediately hooked.  Complicated, convoluted, amazing story line.  If you want to be fascinated and captivated, this is your series.  Pictured product matches what I received. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's amazing to find a new sci-fi book that pretty sure will become a classic, next to the great authors. When you read a book like this you wonder from where does he get the ideas to write all those stories. I read it in no time, and I'm heading to the next book to see how it continues. I only hope that for the next books, in the hurry to write more and more, hate quality won't change. I will let you know after reading them.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This app is nothing like the Nintendo versions for it using the best game it might be fun when the full version comes out
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|This review is NOT a review of the movie (which is awesome).  This is a review on how horrible Paramount is to its fan base.  Even if you bother to buy 3 or 4 copies to get all of the special features, the special features themselves are sorely lacking.  Especially when compared to the previous Star Trek's special features.  It is very disappointing that they would seemingly punish the rather huge and often rabid fan base by being skimpy and greedy.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Once the new weather channel app was set up, it took me a while to realize how to access the hours part of the forecast. That is really what . I go for and I  don't think the new set up is very easy to understand.
B003A166OK|5.0|This was a gift for someone, he loved it. It is what it says it is, and that is exactly what I wanted in this gift.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl did an amazing job directing this movie! It shows how so many people became who they were because of Sound City and it shows the purity of the artists that recorded there.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Love it.....enough said :)<br />My bad....that wasnt enough said.So I will add that I watched this with my girls when they were little and we loved it, Now it's even more special to watch with my grandson. I love it even more these days!!
B005HEDIHG|5.0|These classic episodes look great. I approve of the newer CGI special effects and exterior ship shots. These CGI elements were done years, so aren't new, but I think they improve the overall quality of the original TV episodes. The video was clear and colorful - as you would expect from a show made in the 60's, and the audio was very good. I have been watching these videos on my computer - streaming them while I do other things. I'm a fan of the Classic Star Trek, and maybe that influences my 5-star rating, but there you have it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love a good surprise and this one had it and then some. Great book. I thought I knew what the secret was but, like most people, there are layers under layers.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't wait until January 4th when the next season starts.  I've been watching the past seasons again to refresh my memory.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It wasn't what I thought it would be...it was better. As a random choice for our book club, everyone loved the book. It's slavery from a different perspective. Definitely worth the effort.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I enjoyed this film in the theater seeing it in 3D.  It is enjoyable as much as the 2009 \\"Star Trek.\\"  Received my 3D bluray yesterday.  I guess what you would call this film is a \\"Wrath Of Khan\\" alternate remake?  If that sounds right.  I'm 50 years old.  JJ Abrams is doing a good job on keeping the original Trek going.  The alternate time universe for these films is a simple concept yet quite effective.  They nailed the crew to the original series pretty good. I would really love to see a new Trek remake of the episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever.\\"  Now that would be one hell of a film...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very revealing account of the historical events surrounding the life of Jesus. I have a much better understanding of how and why Christianity arose from an era of messianic and apocalyptic beliefs.
B00607EWYC|5.0|Just went through a similar situation. Paul Harding hits it on the nail. Hard read for some to whom I recommended but worth the effort.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I shouldn't argue since the author has now made millions of dollars on this book.<br /><br />It's at terrible book. Some Brit tries to tell us about the Pacific Northwest She's never been there., It show. She creates a relations of a &#34;submissive.&#34; She has absolutely not clue of what this means. She has never researched the &#34;submissive&#34; I have no idea of why this book has gained attention. It is so poorly written, it is so flawed in every respect, This is the age of the absolutely wretched book reaches international acclaim. This ranked below Naked Came the Stranger. Check it. There is a great story about this book. This don't waste your time. If you are interested in sex, go fin a nice porn site.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|I LOVE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG!! This game played better than expected. You'll have a lot of fun! Good job Sega
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|downloaded this for my grandson and he absolutely love it especially when he can not go outside to play because of the weather
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL TO THIS MOVIE,EVERY THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS GREAT
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies has a well written and interesting plot, is superbly acted, and is a good way to spend an evening of TV.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games I was hooked and with this book I could  not put it down. Definitely wasn't expecting the story to develop as it did, sure was a pleasant surprise. Now on to the last book....
B000P0J024|5.0|I bought this for my husband. We love all these artists and together they are awesome!!! Roy Orbison had such a distinctive voice, which brings depth to this CD.  Who knew George Harrison had such a great voice? It's  throwback music, but never out of style.  I highly recommend this CD
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Never a dull moment! This show has me spending longer time on my treadmill but unfortunately,  staying up late having a hard time putting it down!
B0094KTBBG|3.0|I enjoy the movie and the command of seens that make this a future we may face sooner then latter
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game is easy in the beginning...than it was a bit tricky.However one learns as you go along...look before you match. I have many excellent...You get &quot;excellent&quot; if you can finish puzzle under one minute..The reason why I gave this four stars ...it sometimes ..jumps while I am playing..it doesn't stop the game..but you loose seconds...I guess I am competitive....Download and enjoy! I do!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|I own the Karla Trilogy and read this book in the mid-70s. This Tomas Alfredson film is so rich in nuance and texture that it deserves 5 stars. The reviewers who give it less than 3 stars just don't understand the Cold War period or Circus work environment.<br /><br />As background, I worked on the ChiComm voice desk at NSA during the Vietnam War. I worked at a clandestine Sigint base in East Asia doing analysis of intercepts. IMHO Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy captures the daily grind of intelligence work in the day. It has little of the James Bond penache and excitement.<br /><br />This film is definitely Brit-Euro in speed and artistic tone. One reviewer points out that Gary Oldman, playing super sleuth George Smiley, doesn't have any lines during the 1st twenty minutes, he just sits there taking it all in. What's ultimately going on is his boss is looking for a Soviet Mole at the top of the Circus (HQ) in London. This may be a Cambridge grad recruited in college, producing high quality intellegince for Moscow Centre at the direction of Karla.<br /><br />For a more youthful American audience, the film co-stars Benedict Cumberbatch, recently a co-star of Star Trek Into Darkness, as sidekick to Gary Oldman. Also, Tom Hardy deserves special mention as Ricky Tarr, one of the henchmen who do the dirty work for the Circus. Overall, the cast is full of great European players.<br /><br />I can recommend Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a great story about espionage during the Cold War. Director Alfredson and author John LeCarre (see numerous popular novels) did a wonderful job.<br /><br />(C)2011 Karla Films, Ltd and Universal Pictures.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This movie was fun.  Not many redeeming qualities but fun to watch with all the &#34;old&#34; action heroes like Sly Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris.  So let your guard down and just enjoy the movie.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This is directed by the same director of The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow. But this seems like a forced movie that coincided with the capture and kill of OBL. The action is great, but there was a lot of dialogue for a movie like this. If you want to see a really good movie, watch ARGO.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the book, but felt the end left some loose ends.  I will miss the characters I grew to love!
193700788X|4.0|I am sad to be completely done with the series because it has pretty much consumed my reading time for the last couple years getting through all of the books. I liked the book, flew through this one just like all of the others. A bit surprised by who Sookie ends up with in the end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app where you take care of your horse. Of course the ads are annoying but if you turn the wi fi off they will not appear.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Cool hidden objects game. Like the graphics. Not so easy that it's boring. Just would like it to be a little longer.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|What did we learn in this series?<br />That.... Dean is the sexiest man or at least one of them in the world.<br />That selective shots of blood spatter is better for imagery than real grizzly scenes.<br />That Dean can even make high noon with the devil seem cool.<br />Can't wait for S6<br />WaAr
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing Coin Dozer at amusement parks so I thought I'd give it a try.  It's almost like the real thing.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good page turner! Have really enjoyed this book.  Author had done a good job of character development.  I recommend this book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots to do, and not easy to complete adding to the attraction of this game, loads to complete and not too boring
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Every day brings more excitement. So glad that I can compete against people I know. I can play this everyday
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|It's a real good series It's a real good action and good It's real good and I hope you like it as much as I did
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Amazing book for someone looking to improve attitude and let the stress out. I know it will make a better person out of me.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Can't play after I update it.  #not happy<br /><br />I love the characters but I can't play the new endor place<br /><br />#budder#Eric Fasick
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My Kindle recently died.  It was exposed to too much moisture.  I had no way to read the books I'd recently purchased. That's when I decided to put it on my cell.  So far I've had no issues and am extremely pleased.  While I intend to get a Kindle PaperWhite eventually, I'm not running out to do it.  Works great.  Two thumbs up.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I've watched this movie over half a dozen times already.  It is a lot of fun and the music is good.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|It is great, I love it! Excellent product, it is absolutely recommendable to hear all over for all old and new Beatlemaniacs!
B00BB8UJKG|2.0|There are quite a few current stars in this movie who acted in this when they were young.  The stories were about sleazy relationships.
B005DNPHN4|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and I always love it! One of my favorites! Traveled to Italy recently and visited the Colosseum-WOW is all I can say!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|The individual stories are easy to follow as the movie flips between them.  Light and entertaining and easy to watch when you need a little amusement.
B00DH773IA|5.0|Really funky - it has a beat and you can dance to it! Seriously, after first listen I was disappointed at the simplicity of the songs on this CD. When I came back to it, it stayed in the CD player for repeat listenings. Some may not get the point of this CD and dismiss it as &#34;lite&#34; or too commercial. It's brilliant in its simplicity. &#34;Al Green&#34; sounds like it's straight from Memphis. Buy it and support one of the finest purveyors of jazz guitar today.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This book somehow was mentioned about 10 times in the span of a week.  Therefore, I had to read it.  It was one of those books that I could not put down.  I was confused at first about how it came about and all that, but once the story actually started, it was really really good.  I highly recommend this book.  I cannot say it was a fast read per se, because once I get into a book, I read like a madwoman, and I was INTO this book.  Extremely creative, not what I expected, and has caused me to look into getting many more books by this author.
B00ENBS4GO|3.0|the first two seasons and the third limited season were all fabulous. this season is ok, a reasonable conclusion to the series, but not as good as prior seasons. john Hannah and lucy lawless sorely missed. fans should definitely check it out.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|I finally decided to bite the bullet and get this book.  The movie is one of my favorites of all times.  I am not sure I would have been upset to have read the book and watched the movie on this one, because the stories really did depart, and the movie absolutely captured my heart.  The book captured my mind.  What a story.  I really enjoyed this different look in to the lives of these people.  I have been inspired to pick up other books by Truman Capote.  Worth a read, or two.  A classic.  Highly recommended.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|enjoyed it,  an implausible contrived plot. but worth a rental for a slow rainy day. a decent cast helps a lot.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|She aspires to be an artist but doesn't realize she inspires me. She caught an ad for this book on her Kindle and begged for it. Of course we picked it up for her and she devoured it in two days and said to me, \\"Dad, the author said all the things you've told me about being creative... it was AWESOME!\\"  So, thank you Austin Klein... My word was good enough, or so she tells me, but your word validated mine and the look of awe she gave me was worth the cost of your book many times over.  Now the fact she was spending the afternoon developing a better understanding of a character in her revamped short story... that's priceless... THANK YOU.  Now I wouldn't normally leave such a personal message to an author on an Amazon review but something tells me the message will be received :)
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|very well done. r.downey jr. as iron man has grown on me, he owns the part. the avengers by far is the best &#34;iron man&#34; film, can't wait for avengers 2 but this is pretty good. Gwyneth paltrow gets better and better and pepper has a bigger role in this film which is a good thing. she reminds me of that axe commercial &#34;girls keep getting hotter and hotter&#34; she wears a pair of denim shorts the way they should be worn, but I digress. a fun flick with all the bells and whistles. and ben kingsley is fabulous as a menacing villain with a great twist. enjoy.
B004HYDM0A|4.0|This came into my field of vision after some football player (I think) had some disastrous thing happen with an imaginary person from the interwebs.  Now, when you get onto the google machine and give someone your heart, bad things can happen.  I have heard a few things and read a few movies about this movie being somehow contrived or set up.  I am just not sure about this.  What I can tell you is that I was glued.  This could happen to any of us.  This movie could certainly be a good teaching tool for teens, too, so that they can really understand that not everyone is as they present themselves on the web.  It was something like a car accident that you cannot keep your eyes off of.  I cannot say I loved it because it sort of upset me and made me feel a little creepy.  But I would definitely say it was worth watching.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|These DVDs are what I needed to finish my Star Wars library.  They all played well in my DVD player.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is pretty fun. Its not to hard that you give up but is still challenging and makes you want to play more. You'll keep telling yourself &quot;just one more level&quot; every single time
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Saw it in the theater and loved it so I had to buy it.  Now I can watch it anytime I want.  Hahaha!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved this book! I felt sad when I finished it. This was my first Zombie book. I think I'm hooked! Probably going to read it again.It wasn't just about zombies... but also about how the world worked and what the world went through during WWZ
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to browse the categories of all the things I love...  It's like you will never run out of ideas for all the things you want to do, whether it's crafting, cooking etc.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|A truely great film for people of all ages. A timeless classic, I thoroughly enjoyed. Excellent job by amazon getting this blue ray to us.
B00CCCF4NW|5.0|I was first introduced to Jon Hopkins through a set promoted by the Boiler Room. The album at first listen is a grasp of deeper, quiet felt transitions, ranging from exciting head-bobbing beats, to nostalgic piano scores reminiscent of age old classics. An album to listen to while working tediously by your computer or artwork. Open the windows ahead of you, let the cool breeze envelope you while you sit back to enjoy this wonderful composition by Mr. Hopkins.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I did not read the book before I saw this movie as I usually like to do, all in the same. Great movie.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I LOVE this book, it was so interesting. It got me excited and wondering. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book
B007SGM084|2.0|Being an avid reader I never saw the need to read this trilogy; until off a splash of curiosity and lack of other material I bought the kindle edition set. Best sellers - so why now try them out right? Very unimpressive.<br /><br />The only real reason I see anyone liking this book is because of the steamy, play-by-play and porn like xxx sequences that literally almost are used to fill up empty page space. Yea, they're pretty steamy/graphic scenarios but, after maybe the 20th or so I began skipping ahead trying to find the story.<br /><br />The story is lack luster and honestly reminds me of another teen love fantasy. Innocent girl trying to sooth the &#34;bad boy&#34; and &#34;fix&#34; him in unrealistic happenings.  Twilight etc...  I UNDERSTAND this is a fantasy - obviously - but fantasy is supposed to be made to an extent so it's entertaining to read and is able to let you imagine believing the world the story takes you into.<br /><br />I got through book 1 and 1/2 of book 2... Only to find myself bored and looking up the spoilers online to find out where the characters ended up (pretty predictable at this point)  ----- I won't say that I hated this but, it is the same concept baseline that is overtaking our young adult genre and theatres the last few years with different characters and scenario. Sorry guys/girls - I look forward to seeing what kind of movie they can make this into, without rating it X or putting it behind the curtain at the movie store ;) ;)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a simple read and the most fascinating books I have ever read. It intrigues the mind and blows the mind as well. Its simply amazing.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|Excellent. Ramin, Sierra and Hadley nailed it!  Beautiful voices and phenomenal production.  Entire show well done and loved the added extra at the end
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a really great app and is similar to the actual website so nothing new. Pinterest itself is a cool website to get ideas on hairstyles, find out what to cook for dinner, and just to let people know what your favorite things in life are.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. Some of Zeppelin's best music.<br /><br />The best band in the world in my opinion.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I ordered this when it first became available as a pre-order. My husband is a Trekie and this is of course the only one he didn't have. I received the order today, it took about 5 months. Everything was as usual, great condition, order came in when expected, but as I looked at my paper work it stated a different price. Yes, the price had went down since I ordered it and instead of just charging me like normal I received the discount. Very cool. Another reason to love Amazon.
B00004X10B|5.0|This Item is awesome . Its big and can fit every camera accessories you have for ur cam . I bought this for a gift for my husband :-D... He loved it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Very gripping story, hard to put down and not keep reading.  Would recommend to read. Looking forward to reading more of Jojo Moyes books

B00BCMT4RA|2.0|I do not have an original to compare it to but the remix from analog to digital causes Albert's voice to be drowned out by the instrumental music.
B001VTTRC6|4.0|You won't come away with a warm, toasty feeling with this movie.  Not exactly a predictable plot, but also not shocking.  The best part is the acting of Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon.  I usually don't care for those two, but they are engaging and believable in their roles.  So glad I don't live in Boston!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary was so much better then the other one I tried. Its easy to find the words I need.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I'm not a teenager although I was one many years ago.  I really enjoyed this show.  Acting is actually pretty good too.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|No problems thus far! :) This product is working perfectly fine, and the longer length of the cord is nice.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|This is about the DVD release not the Blu-ray.I can't believe there is no extras on this disc.Not a one.They could have released a 2 disc version like they did for the 2009 movie.Why are these companies(Paramount & Disney) being so cheap now.They make billions.There is no excuse for this.
1572814136|5.0|Bought this for my mom and she loves it, says the color and art work are pristine...not to mention that it's not folding up at the corners etc. although she uses it everyday...
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I was a big fan of the original Star Trek series in the late 60s, and as I have said before, I used to race home to see it on TV when there was a new episode.  As a matter of fact, we were probably the first people on our block who owned a color television, and from what I remember, the series originally aired in color.  (I remember watching the first lunar landing on TV, and I was very disappointed that it was in black and white.  \\"Where is the high definition color, in 3D!\\" would have been my exact words if HD existed at the time, and if I hadn't have been in awe of that event.  And yes, 3D did exist, albeit in a different form.)<br /><br />The first Star Trek film with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto was pure bliss.  After years and years of borderline lame Star Trek films, I was really proud of the way that the director, producers, and screenwriter pulled off that first film.  It was a true homage to the series, never devolving in any way; there were characters and not caricatures, and the dialog and action were fantastic.  So, I was really looking forward to this film.  And boy, was I disappointed.  No, make that borderline mad.<br /><br />This is really a stinkeroo, in every way.  Everything that they got right in that first film was seemingly turned on its head in \\"Into Darkness.\\"  I could complain about all kinds of things, but what was the worst:  the dialog.  Way, way, way too much exposition here.  You have characters talking and talking and talking, and it never seems to end.  Kind of like a review that rips a film such as this.<br /><br />One piece of dialog that really was a misfire:  when Bones is trying to convince Kirk not to do something -- I can't remember exactly what that was, and I really don't care -- and the doctor said something like, \\"That would be like robbing a bank when you have a getaway car with a flat tire!\\"  Now, I don't know about you, but cars will NOT have tires that far in the future; they will surely be flying cars.  So this character would surely not use this metaphor in this scenario that far in the future.  No way.  No stinking way!<br /><br />And then he used another!  Something about a poker player and an ace card.  Yikes.  Well, at least the dialog was somewhat saved by the Kirk character when he responded with something like, \\"Enough with the metaphors already!\\"  I couldn't have agreed more.  And it would have been better if Kirk would have looked into the camera -- ala Woody Allen -- and said something like, \\"O.K.  I can't believe that I have to speak this dialog.  But I'm under contract to do so and so please don't get mad at me.  Get mad at the writer instead.\\"  (Naturally, with most Woody Allen films, the writer would be himself but whatever.)<br /><br />A huge misfire, of intergalactic proportion.  I will go three here only because some of the special effects and cinematography were really good.  But this would be a pretty big pass by me, in any galaxy, and I might say something like, \\"How about if we take the original hard drive that this film is on and throw it into the Event Horizon?\\"
B001KZOUQE|1.0|This is one of those movies where the camera jerks about so violently that you'll want to throw up or turn off the movie. What's even worse, in Friday Night Lights, is that the camera always seems about eight inches from the performers' faces. It's like standing on a painfully overcrowded deck of a ship that is lurching in heavy seas. These cinematic techniques, I'm confident, are intended to create tension and emotion in the viewer. And to those ends it is indeed effective. The problem is, it's the wrong emotion. It's unsettling and unpleasant. If you want to see a great movie about football, watch Rudy, or watch We Are Marshall. Or any other good sports movie that engages rather than repels. Good movies rely upon plot and characterization to engage the viewer, not on wall-to-wall gimmicks. This one is repulsive.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This product is very limited in what it does (Netflix, YouTube, & Google Play movies), but what it does, it does well, and for $35, it's well worth it. I was using a Wii to access Netflix; the picture quality was bad, and it kept freezing up. The Chromecast was relatively easy to install and setup (see below) and the picture quality is 1000X better than the Wii. We watched 3 hours straight on Netflix and didn't have a single problem.<br /><br />Potential negatives:<br /><br />1) The Chromecast apparently requires some high ephemeral ports to be opened in order to function properly. This is only an issue if you are placing it behind a firewall or router that has been configured securely. If you are setting it up on your ISP's wifi router, it should work just fine. (Let that sink in for a moment...)  This may be an issue at some hotels if you plan to take your Chromecast with you when you travel, as it may simply not work with their network configuration.<br /><br />2) You may want to consider buying a cheap tablet to use as a dedicated remote control for it. Some major cable TV providers offer an app to use your smart device as a remote, so a dedicated tablet could serve as a single remote for both.<br /><br />3) I really wish Chromecast supported more stuff. It would be nice to be able to go to PBS.org, for example, and cast that to the device for remote playing. Perhaps in time they will add more application support.<br /><br />Edit: After some time, the Chromecast became annoyingly unreliable. We started having problems with it losing connectivity with the tablet we bought to control it. The only way to recover was to do a full power reset on all devices. We have since switched to using a Sony Blueray player with Internet features built in. It is highly reliable. Not sure why it worked well at first and then got worse. Reduced rating from 4 stars to 3.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|The game is hard but not frustrant, there are many rules and you need to read well to master the game.<br />The materials are good, with beautiful illustrated cards and sturdy tokens.<br />The many different &#34;adventure&#34;, &#34;great ancient&#34; and &#34;investigators&#34; cards make the game various and replayable.<br />There's also some material to download to add or change game rules and mechanics.<br />The game can be played by 1 to 8 players so it is suitable for every kind of party with friends.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|It also right l like the graphics and the tasks. The battled are fun<br />Challenging. It is kinda slow at times.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Won't play at all in my Samsung blu ray player.  I bought DVD and blu ray combo here and blu ray player says unplayable.  Had to watch regular DVD.  Blu ray player plays all others.  Firmware is up to date.  Bad batch of discs??  Very upset.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We loved this movie. Fun for all ages.<br /><br />This would be a great movie for Halloween since its coming up next month.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|What an incredible book!!! It's a long read but this and the follow up Winter of the World are absolutely fantastic reads!!! I cannot wait for the final book in the trilogy!! I liked it better than his Pillars series
0385738773|5.0|My son and I both loved this book, perfect mix of thrills and chills.  We are loving the whole series and it is nice to share a book with your child.
B009NY43NY|1.0|If ever a series needed to be ended this was long past due. When Ms Harris started writing the Sookie books I was enamored. Sadly it seemed like even she gave up around book six or seven. Unfortunately I am one of those people that has to see something through to the end. I suggest waiting for the library release and picking up one of her other series.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Lots of fun and very addictive. Great graphics I would like it to have a few customizing features, but excellent game.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|MM plays his part well, good acting from the kids too.  a kinda tom sawyer\huck fin adventure.  We were hooked in from start to finish.

B00BESCJII|5.0|this was a lovely surprise.  not as good as the book, but most movies aren't.  Not sure how many freshman befriend seniors in real life, but this is a very touching story about growing up and some of the issues of growing up with issues...that's  all i'll say as I don't want to spoil anything!<br /><br />Actually, I thought of something else to say...This is NOT a modern day Breakfast Club...the issues experienced by the saturday detention \\"breakfast club\\" are fairly typical, even sterotypical issues HS students dealt with on a regular basis.  The issues in POBAWF are Atypical...Yes, it is a good movie for young people to watch and many may relate to it as many did to Breakfast Club, but I think the POBAWF goes a step beyong typical teenage angst in Breakfast Club.
B0053KWDES|2.0|It does well, it certainly makes a difference of sound quality for the better. However, you can't use it while it's charging. That almost makes the product worthless, because when I forget to turn it off, it dies, and I can't use it again until I charge it for an hour. The battery life is fairly long, though, I'd estimate 8-9 hours. The sound quality it produces is nice, too. But not being able to charge it while it's in use is horrible.

B000FGGE68|5.0|\\"Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a world you may not understand.\\" This is the first line in the movie.  This is one of my favorite movies in my personal collection. This movie is action tied down by no heavy story. Ultraviolet is a true bad ass babe perfect for Milla Jovovich. A visual feast from start to finish.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought into the hype and got this book because I had heard SOOO much about it.  What a disappointment.  The plot is bland and predictable.  The characters are shallow and boring.  I mean, come on, a young, tall, copper-haired rich man takes interest in a mousy, never-been-kissed brunette.  How is this not &#34;Twilight&#34;?  And for a virgin, she sure is adventurous!  Let's be honest here, this is porn for women.  Pure and simple.  While I enjoyed some of the steamy &#34;love&#34; scenes, this is not what I would normally be interested in reading.  I didn't even bother to pick up the other two books.  I can't believe they are making this into a movie.  I won't be wasting any of my money on that either.

B00EJ9RIXA|2.0|This app seems like it could be very useful and a definite improvement over the web browser interface, but it comes up quite short.<br /><br />The Good:<br />This app has a very clean look & the folder structure looks just like Google Drive would on a computer browser. It's very easy to navigate around your folders. When you want to download an item, you have several file formats available depending on the file type. It will allow you to download them directly to your device for available offline viewing/editing.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Unfortunately, downloading files to your device is the only way to view/edit them. And as a result, you cannot upload those files back to the Google Drive making this completely useless for anything other than a portal to transfer files from Google Drive to your device. If you have any desire to edit items in your drive then you'll have to navigate through the web browser (which does work, but the interface isn't very clean when editing).<br /><br />Basically, this app is just a nice looking download manager that lets you access items you've already stored on your Google Drive. It's nice for that, but hardly acceptable to call it \\"the best app for managing/downloading your Google Drive\\" as they do in the description. As other reviewers have stated, take the negative reviews seriously if you're considering spending your money for this app. It's very likely you'll be disappointed.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A little on the dark side but a fun action movie.  Good action scenes if not very realistic - not meant to be a realistic story.

B008JFUR10|5.0|This is my favorite movie of the summer. Best cgi I have ever seen. Their was never a part in the movie were I felt like one of the robot or monsters looked unrealistic. I really liked the actors. I didn't think the acting was cheesy at all. And I really liked how the battles had some comic relief. These really intense battles would be going on and then something would happen that was really funny. A lot of people say this is power rangers for adults. And I wont lie, I can kind of see it. Not of bad thing at all though. This movie did really bring out the kid in a lot of people. I really got into it. I just loved it. Go see it. If you don't enjoy, your doctor needs to prescribe you some seriously powerful pills.

B003M70O5O|5.0|Same as my rating from season 1. And at least, unlike some movies and shows, the timelines were accurate from season to season.
0345530578|2.0|The first half grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  Unfortunately it was all downhill from there.  The first half had me liking Malcolm/Max...but by the end, I could care less about the character and couldn't wait to be done with it.  From decent not-guilty guy on a mission to sleazeball crook...what a downhill trip from a book that began so well.  Bummer.
B00CBQASCQ|3.0|Wong Kar-wai writes and directs The Grandmaster, starring Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as the legendary Wing Chun martial artist, Yip Man (or Ip Man).  The film chronicles the life of the man most well-known for training the legendary Bruce Lee - taking place mostly during the 1930s.  However, long before he trained Lee, Yip Man lived a once peaceful life with a wife and children.  But, when a grandmaster, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), retires, a martial arts civil war breaks out between North and South China. Yip Man is chosen to represent his country in the South, eventually defeating the master, which prompts his daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) to reclaim her family's honor by facing-off against Ip Man.  The two are intrigued with one another, and attempt to stay in contact.  Eventually, the Japanese invade China and force him to abandon his comfortable life, choosing to face down a life of poverty and become a martial arts teacher.  Chang Chen, Zhao Benshan, and Song Hye-kyo also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />To be honest, this is a film that will try your patience as a movie lover in more ways than one.  Since this is a Chinese film, the film is completely subtitled (that's not a knock, just a vital piece of information that you should be prepared for, especially if subtitles aren't your cup of tea).  Aside from the subtitles, this is a film that bounces around quite a bit as a great deal of information is covered and interpreted in a relatively short amount of time (depending which cut of the film you see - since there are three).  The film focuses mainly on Ip Man, but also intertwines with Gong Er - portrayed by the emotionally-engaging Zhang Ziyi.  From the get-go, The Grandmaster describes how each martial artist uses his or her own fighting techniques, often incorporating more than one style - and adapt it to their own.  This vital information (seeming irrelevant at times) is vital to the overall understanding of these historical figures.  In the event that you're not familiar with martial arts (and I'll happily admit I was pretty clueless), this film can be unexpectedly difficult to follow.<br /><br />Admittedly, The Grandmaster can quickly lose your attention with its scattered plot and quick movements, and it's understandable if you end up checking your watch a few times.  But, just when you think it's lost its way - the martial art action kicks in to save this film from the abyss.  In fact, the opening sequence is by far the most enjoyable sequence of the film as Yip Man quickly squares off against an endless amount of \\"bad guys\\" - in the rain, no less.  It will quickly feel reminiscent of the fight sequence between Neo and Agent Smith in The Matrix: Revelations - only without the endless amount of buildings being destroyed.  Regardless, this sequence is a wonderful piece of choreography (as is the entire film), which highlights the attributes of the film's star - Tony Leung Chiu-Wai.  Ip Man is portrayed as a cool, calculating, and absolutely confident in his skills - all of which are lightning quick, not to mention lethal.<br /><br />The most outstanding element of this film (behind the acting of Tony Leung) is the soundtrack, composed by Shigeru Umebayashi, Nathaniel M&eacute;chaly and Stefano Lentini.  With so many different details in modern films, the music has lost a great deal of recognition - unless it includes a big name musician singing a song at the end of the credits.  It seems to be a rarity that music score stands out, but in this case, the music sets the tone for this film.  From the Chinese opera to the exquisite themes throughout, the music contributes the constant shift in mood and tone.  Most film scores are simply average, but this particular film thrives largely because of such an emotional musical composition - so much so that it wouldn't be the worst idea to add this soundtrack to your music collection (assuming you're into classical music).<br /><br />Over the years, there have been severalinterpretations of Ip Man's life, including a handful of popular films, including Ip Man, and Ip Man 2 - not to mention several TV projects.  This film focuses on the intertwining characters that defined the important moments of Ip Man's life.  Thankfully, it balances dramatic turmoil with a significant amount of action - which should be enough to attract causal fans of martial art combat.  Although the film is choppy and quick paced (from year to year), it has the ability to briefly enlighten movie-goers about the man responsible for training an entire generation of martial artists - one of which is Bruce Lee.  However, Lee's characterization in this film is brief and only as a child, so those hoping to see that portion of Ip Man's life will be disappointed.  Regardless, if this film had to be described by using only one word, the word would be elegant.  And, if nothing else - The Grandmaster will show you the importance of a button (yes, a button).<br /><br />GRADE:  C+<br />FNDNreview.compretations of Ip Man's life, including a handful of popular films, including Ip Man, and Ip Man 2 - not to mention several TV projects.

B00C8EQ5SW|5.0|Super tv series.  the cast is very believeable and teh writing is excellent.  So many sub plots that the time just flies by watchuing each episode.
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|In 1996, Before Sunrise debuted to critical acclaim from viewers and critics.  The story is a spontaneous love story about a man and woman that meet on a train traveling to Vienna.  Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) depart the train together and spend their evening conversing in a variety of different locations within the city and eventually fall head over heels for each other.  However, Jesse is on his way back to the U.S. while Celine lives in Paris, making their relationship impossible.  In the end, they part ways without exchanging information, but promising to meet each other 6 months later.  The story ends without giving viewers an answer on whether they actually met for their plan rendezvous.<br /><br />The sequel, Before Sunrise, was released in 2004 and picks up nine years.  Jesse has just written a bestselling novel based on the events of the evening between himself and Celine.  He has traveled to Paris on a book tour, only to be visited by Celine at his book signing.  Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Jesse did show up six months after their evening together, but Celine was unable to attend due to the death of her grandmother.  Jesse and Celine spend the sequel catching up and reconnecting with one anther - revealing that Jesse is unhappily married and now has a son, while Celine is working for an environmental organization.  Once again, they spend their constrained time together (Jesse has to catch a flight back to the U.S.) talking about their lives and about what could have been.  In the end, the two realize they have a second chance with one another - and the film ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, presuming Jesse misses his flight to stay with Celine.<br /><br />Nine years after Jesse decides to miss his plane, Before Midnight picks up with Jesse and Celine together in a relationship, on vacation in Greece with their twin daughters.  Jesse is now divorced and separated from his son Hank who now lives in Chicago with his mother.  While they do still care for one another, Jesse and Celine's priorities have changed - Celine is now focused on her career, while Jesse (now the author of several novels) is focused on strengthening his relationship with his son.  They have now become the couple they always claimed they would fight to become - a couple that spends the majority of their time together resenting one another and arguing.<br /><br />Once again, Richard Linklater helms the directing chair as he, along with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, collaborate on this possible final chapter in the lives of Jesse and Celine.  Taking place loosely in real-time, the couple is much different than the last time these characters were on the big screen.  While Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were films about falling in love and rediscovering love, Before Midnight is very much a film about two people trying to figure out whether or not they are still in love.  Do they still have a future together or has their relationship run its course?  That's the question these characters contemplate for the entirety of this film.<br /><br />Like the previous films, the interaction between Hawke and Delpy is perfectly rounded and in depth as they easily feed off one another with each passing scene, un-layering each dimension of their personal lives.  The film is a filled with strong, relentless conversation (as usual) as the gaps are filled in for this second nine year gap  - in which it is revealed that the couple moved to the U.S. for a few years while Jesse wrote his novels and then back to Europe.  Jesse's second novel is based on the story of how they reconnected in Before Sunset.  However, as Jesse has made new writing friends and spent his time traveling the world for book signings, these characters have clearly lost faith in one another - both accusing each other of being unfaithful (and no, they never got married).<br /><br />Before Midnight is cut into several chapters, discussing a variety of subjects, which includes a film-long discussion about Jesse's desire to move to Chicago and the impact it would have on his relationship with Celine.  Unlike the previous films, several new characters are introduced and explored - Jesse's writing friends and their spouses.  Quite a bit of time is focused on the varying opinions from these new characters on the subjects of sex and relationships.  Make no mistake, love is still the underlying theme of this film - but it is also about evolution between two characters that found each other, found each other again, and decided to make a life for themselves despite the roadblocks.  Before Midnight is not a film about two people making spontaneous decisions as it predecessors.  These characters have matured and carefully dissect one another with each passing word and action, both looking to reclaim the happiness that was once in their hands but has faded with time.<br /><br />Overall, Before Midnight is simply the next chapter in a beautiful saga based around two individuals that met on a train.  The acting is as pleasant as ever and enjoyable to the very end.  It would appear the saga of Jesse and Celine is complete, however, that doesn't necessarily mean there won't be another chapter.  With undeveloped relationships to explore with their children, it's easily to imagine the next film(s) exploring the parents/ children dynamic.  And, I don't think you'll find a single person complaining if another film is made - but sooner than nine years would be great.  Regardless, this romance saga will go down in film history as one of the greatest love stories ever told.<br /><br />GRADE:  A<br />FNDNreview.comncludes a film-long discussion about Jesse's desire to move to Chicago and the impact it would have on his relationship with Celine.

B008602KQI|5.0|For the most part, this film matches the book.  The book is, of course, better detailed and was easy to read...a strong draw to read it let me through the trilogy in less than a busy month.  Where the film breaks from the book, it was obviously due to a limited budget.  But, even then it was hardly a noticeable difference.  Recommended, but maybe read the book first.
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|My four year old loves this movie, I was excited to see a great price and came in perfect condition, speedily (a new word :)
B009RX85N0|5.0|Once upon a time is a great show!<br />Season two has met every expectation for continued enjoyment. It's fun to remember the fairy tales, and pull them into modern stories as well.<br />Love this series!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|We loved this movie, very wholesome, good sound and great graphics!! came quickly and packaged nicely without damage.  My sons so happy to have it!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|The music is wonderful in this movie. I have watched this so many times and it never gets old. Love it!!
B00340LM8C|4.0|As a Cary Grant movie, it's his usual GREAT.  Not a &#34;sit on the edge of your seat&#34; movie, like some of his are.
1934356476|5.0|The book contains great practical examples of how to use metaprogramming, taking you through basic designs and improving them incrementally with concepts from the text.  I found this easy to understand and useful from a process standpoint.  Like many others, I'd used Ruby metaprogramming many times before without fully understanding what I was doing.  The book filled in many missing details for me.  For the first time I felt I understood the Ruby object model.  I actually dreamed of the object model after reading the book, seeing all of the parts line up. In contrast to some other reviewers, I like how the book weaves a story about two fictional coworkers as it explicates metaprogramming concepts. The light-hearted side story made it super readable for me since I enjoy narrative.  The storyline kept me interested and made the text less dry.  In conclusion, this is an excellent book that I will return to again and again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to put the pieces together of Ruby Metaprogramming.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Watching a couple of episodes of the TV show got me hooked on Longmire. So I got this book and absolutely loved it! The writing is beautiful- the author paints exquisite pictures with his words, his characters are interesting and sympathetic, even with all their real-life flaws, the dialogue and humor clever. The mystery was intriguing- had me wondering almost to the end. I've gone and ordered 2 more books in the series. I recommend this book highly.
B00BDSRBXM|5.0|Another great album from a pleasantly resurgent OMD.  Not much to add to what everyone else is saying.  Except that the more that I hear what is being produced by the &#34;bands of today&#34;, the more I reach back into the 20th century!
B0026Q8EWW|3.0|Average movie, reasonably good acting, however the movie does not follow the book plot very accurately, which was quite a disappointment for me.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler delivers again.  It's good to see one of music's &#34;giants&#34; still producing quality albums on a regular basis.  Hopefully people will keep buying so that we do not lose someone else in the download freefall.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|A very bloody, cool action flick.  It further proves that Karl Urban is way underrated as an actor.  He turned a great performance without even seeing his face!  He would've made a way better Batman than Christian Bale, but I digress.  The story was there to basically connect all the action together and the actors played their roles for what they were.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to strap in for a cool, 90min, sci-fi getaway!

B00EY8A6BC|3.0|My girlfriend rolled her eyes when I said that the movie should have stayed close to reality.  I thought that most the movie was pretty cool until the end when instead of magic, they were using visual effects for the tricks.  Can't give too many details without spoilers but they could've stuck with doing things that could at least happen in real life.  Besides that, it has an interesting story with plot twists that you, as the viewer, are trying to solve the whole way through.

There's a pen nib but I subbed that out for the black light ink -- what's cooler than secret messages revealed with fun noises?!<br /><br />It's a little light in terms of heft which is what gives it away that it's not an actual sonic screwdriver.<br /><br />It doesn't work on wood but that was expected.

1442346949|4.0|Comprehensive and well written - Walter Isaacson does not disappoint. He doesn't pull punches when it comes to the mean and spiteful side of Jobs. But it is clear that the man was a genius in his own right, albeit a flawed one.<br /><br />Another reason this book is so enjoyable is that it's also a history of modern computing. It would be impossible to discuss the rise and fall and resurrection of Apple without speaking of Microsoft, Xerox, HP, and other companies that were instrumental in computing as we know it today.<br /><br />Fascinating read.
0345315227|5.0|Loved the conclusion to the odyssey series.  I have all of the books in my collection.  I liked 3001 the best of all of them because it really gives a feel for how society could be in 3001.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|This novel is still great. I think it's a great commentary on technology, capitalism, religion, and of course, the environment and how we as humans commune with it. There's also an exploration on what it means to be human, is it specifically our DNA? Is it possible organisms that share less than 100% of human genetic make-up still be human?<br /><br />'MaddAddam' lacks the power of 'The Year of the Flood' and the horror of 'Oryx and Crake', still it's a fine Margaret Atwood novel and 100% enjoyable.

This book deserves more than five stars, more than infinity stars for the matter. I can't. I just can't. I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />Generally, when you think of a cancer book, or any other book where a tragic illness is acquired, you think, “ Oh my God, this is Fitz going to be one of those depressing books where they just don't get better ans they're just going to die and I'm going to be a crying mess on the floor while my parents look at me like there's something wrong with me or that I need psychological help.\\" Yes, and no.<br /><br />No, this wasn't depressing. Yes, one of the characters doesn't get better and eventually dies. And yes, I did get teary-eyed and almost break down on the ground. But I think this cancer book is freaking spectacular and not at all depressing. But I have to admit: at the end of the book, it felt incomplete. But I think that that was the point. In the novel, they refer to \\"An Imperial Affiliation\\" a lot. And they talk about how the novel just ends, mid-sentence. TFIOS doesn't end mid-sentence, but at the end, j felt myself wondering what happened to the other characters, just like Augustus and Hazel had.<br /><br />TFIOS has everything {and more, actually} that every good story needs: Humor, Love and Romance, Conflict, and a little bit of tragedy and death. All in all, point of this review is that you need to go read it. And if you don't like it...I don't know what to say to you because you SHOULD like it. Enough said.

B00005NWM3|5.0|I had this album in the past, and it was stolen from my car.  I'm happy to have replaced it.
B003NS2T9G|2.0|The writing was poorly crafted and many of the plots straight rip-offs. The biggest problem I had was with the continually fluctuating sexuality of EVERY character in the show. I am not a homophobe and I have no problem (not much anyway) seeing gay lifestyles depicted on television if it done in a normal and natural fashion. The scenes in this show were about as natural and welcome as a prison rape. Nearly every character in a majority of the episode flip-flopped their sexuality with the casualness and frequency of changing their socks. It was so over-used that it became the central theme to the show and the plot of fighting aliens secondary. I kept hoping the writers would get it back on track but 5 minutes into episode 1 of season 2 it was clear they were going to continue and I will not return to the show, which is a shame because I was really excited when I finished Doctor Who and saw it listed amongst Amazon Prime's offerings.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I didn't like the controlling of the game from my kindle. It didn't make me want to play it any longer after a few plays.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|There are 'instant link' buttons on the home page that don't DO anything. Still looking for a good search engine for Kindle Fire.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|It's very entertaining, it surprised me, I really like this game. G5 really makes new age, cutting edge games. This won't disappoint.
140006922X|4.0|The author takes great pains to footnote and reference his observations on the times of Jesus of Nazareth. He draws an easy-to-follow cause- and -affect line of how this humble man became the 'Christ'. I had hoped that more could have been revealed about what happened to the body of Jesus after the crucifixion and reappearance to the disciples, but that is open to one's own beliefs. I hope that as the future of DNA testing unfolds, that the family of James and Jesus can be uncovered. That remains for the future.<br /><br />In 'Zealot', I feel like I got a good overview of what life was like in the first few centuries C.E., and why I should care.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books. These are the best books I have read in a long time.Love his twitchy palm.A must read!!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|The movie looked like computer graphics. It was a little disconcerting at first, but you get used to it. I can't tell how close it stays to the F. Scott Fitzgerald story, because I never read the original, but it this was a good story with some familiar faces.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This is an amazing book coming from a relatively un-educated (in formal terms) boy.  I spend a lot of time in the area of Malawi where this book is set and it shows the life and hardships accurately.  I especially liked the description of the terrible famine in 2002-2003; I knew about it but people don't share their problems with non-Malawians --- now I grieve for them well after the fact.<br />The intelligence and drive of this young man is incredible; his book should be required reading for everyone.<br />I am taking it on Kindle readers to a school for deaf children located about 2 hours away from this boy's home in hopes it will inspire our older kids to &#34;just go for it&#34;.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me on the edge the whole time! Strong characters, good writing, and the plot while not expected flowed easily. The book did not feel forced.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great story line that is compeling.  Hard to wait between episodes.  Acting is great and the characters have depth.  Well worth watching
B004XDYJRU|1.0|UPDATE: I guess we now know why TuneIn Radio Pro (paid version) is tracking your location: NOTIFICATION SPAM ADVERTISING!  Do you really want to pay for ads?<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Sure, it works as advertised, but why does this need to receive unrequested data FROM the internet, *and* start on boot, meaning this app is always on, running in the background?<br /><br />I'm not much of a fan, either, of the location tracking.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I've been meaning to re-read these books for awhile. (I intend to read the entire series over the next few weeks!) I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. I'd forgotten certain characters/story elements: the professor, the beavers, turkish delight, among others. I appreciated the pacing and how easy it was to read. I was completely enamored of this series when I read it years ago, and now, I understand why.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|Stickman has gone to the Dark Side and sticks you with hidden extra costs through in-app purchasing.  If you haven't bought this game then avoid it.  If you already own it, don't update it.  If you find yourself with the IAP version, try to downgrade or uninstall it, and certainly don't let your kids play it if you have the IAP version.<br /><br />The problem is that from the original version, HitCents REMOVED portions of the game with an update without telling paying customers.  In other words, customers had to PAY AGAIN to get the rest of the game they already paid for once.<br /><br />The five-star reviews are either from before the game changed to include IAP and removed functionality, or users are coerced/nagged/bribed into leaving a review. Most believe that if they don't give five stars, then the review doesn't count.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I loved the dry humor. For me, the first half of the book was more engaging than the second half of the book. Of course, the entire time I read the book it made me think of the 1976 movie, The Omen. If you like clever satire and end-of-the world, armageddon type scenarios, you might really enjoy this. However, it's not an action-take its more of a head-trip.
B006HL9G10|2.0|Really liked this app until an update turned it into spyware.  The app now wants access to the list of accounts on your phone or tablet, *and* also wants to be able to receive unrequested data FROM the internet; this is called \\"PUSH\\" and lets the developer send your device stuff whether you like it or not.  Why?!?
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was an interesting story...but no very probable.  It was an easy summer read that didn't require deep thinking.  Wasn't a book you couldn't put down...but not a total waste of time either.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I like westerns and I enjoy the television series of Longmier this year.  The book added to my knowledge of the characters and was a much longer and more satisfying mystery than just  watching an hour .
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great variety of restful, rhythmic sounds. Not all are to my liking, but that's just a matter of taste. The sounds I keep going back to I truly love, and I do think I sleep better. Worth the money for more choices of sounds, too, but try the free version first to get a feel for the app to judge for yourself.
B000JWTX3Y|5.0|One of my favorite movies right now. Lindsay Lohan is fun and also engaging through her trials and life lessons.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Release date is 9/13 but I found it this morning at target for $24. My daughter has not put it down since she came home from school. This doll is so beautiful. The color scheme is great and she really catches your eye. Great addition to her collection.
B00EABIZ2K|1.0|Been a huge Blackfield fan since the first album. Saw the DNA tour in Boston - One of my favorite shows ever.  However, THIS 1/2+ album (31:22 total) has maybe 10min worth of listenable music. WIKI states that Aviv picked these songs for the \\"album\\" from 30 total. * perhaps he chose wrong.  * excluding \\"Pills\\" this is nothing like any previous release. Sad. PLUS - where are the mentions of the musicians? 8-panel insert without a single mention. Are they a \\"band\\" OR is this an Aviv solo record (which might explain all that goes wrong on this recording)?
0802473156|5.0|Have only read a few chapters so far but it should be required reading for those looking for a lasting relationship!<br />Makes sense and author Gary Chapman has the experience to guide us & teach about relationships.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game was the free app of the day when I got it but I highly recommended it at it's price now. Really passes time and I am having a blast playing. Not easy at all like some other manning games I have and the pictures change after a number of rounds. Looking forward to playing again after I'm done.
B002UEW31I|4.0|Some indelible scenes and performances.  Christopher Waltz has the lead as the dandy Nazi SS officer, tasked with hunting Jews in occupied France.  Waltz is a ham, and the role calls for it.  He can switch from pleasant society talk to a murderous rage in blink, and there is one scene in which this is done masterfully.  Pitt is uneven.  His hollywood star wattage is never in question, but his acting is at times.  He doesn't quite ruin the film, but his attempt to play an Italian Officer did not work in the least.  Likewise, Diane Kreuger, who plays a German actress who is a spy for the allies, does a German accent that sounds like an American trying to speak in a French accent.  She is terrible.  The director is fantastic, and the film is edited and shot brilliantly.  And the fact that it offers an alternative ending to WWII was just terrific.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have gotten at least 3 of my other friends to start reading this because I was so motivated from it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I like a quick read and these three books hold my attention.  The author's style of writing sort of lets you down with an anticlimax that leaves out a lot of details.  Other than that, loved all three books.
B00DQVST76|2.0|The concert visuals are great and Madonna rocked the house, but the audio mastering of this DVD is very poor.  There is no dynamics at all when compared to the Confessions Tour.  The audio sounded like it was dubbed in the studio and not recorded from the concert.  The entire DVD sounded like low quality mp3.  If you liked the Confessions Tour DVD you will be very disappointed by the audio quality of this.  It's too bad.... because Madonna kicked ass in the concert.
B0073SPDHM|5.0|Wow, exactly what we were looking for. This book also inspires us to be more creative. Nice compilation of Recipes.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|Our family enjoyed watching this again after seeing it a long time ago.  I like Anthony Hopkins in this movie.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|great classic dvd..the collector's edition is fine...great quality, picture sound excellent..i am very pleased with my purchase i will definatelly buy again from this seller and from amazon..thank you!
B0031R5K68|1.0|Plot is pretty much the same as the other books. Felt like I was just re-reading one of the the previous ones.<br />Don't bother.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Had this thing working for about 30 minutes. I hate it. Waste of time and money but it was pretty cheap. Ok I tried it some more after a couple of months. All this thing is for is cast youtube. What? How many people need to cast Netflix? Likely none if that many! So why is casting youtube worth anything? Hey if that is what you want to do this thing is perfect. If you want to do anything else with it, forget about it. It doesn't work.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Awesome! Great pony movie! They should do more episodes where the ponies get turned into people and show more characters.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I did not like this at all.  It was not fun at all.  It was a pain and I deleted it.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|I thought I had seen the best 3D move out there. IMHO MIB-3D. But over-the-top 3D and THEN throw in Nicolas Cage with his classic understated acting style. Why did I not know about this NC movie? I can't wait to get my hands on Drive Angry 2!
B00007KWHG|5.0|All my favorite songs that Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons sang are on this cd.  It's clear<br />and you just start singing along!  The cd arrived on time.  It is in excellent condition.  I would<br />buy more cd's without hesitation.  Listening to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons just makes<br />you want to get up and start dancing!
B00422LESO|5.0|I can totally understand where Jane is coming from with not finding the right guy. Just funny how it took her to England to find not only the right one, but a real loving one on top of that. Loved every single minute of this book. I to am wanting my own Mr. Darcy.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|Smart story, nods to Shakespeare, and reaches for more than simple entertainment. Do I think they were successful? Mostly. There were story moments leaving me wanting.
B00DQVST76|3.0|I'm not really happy with the Blu Ray, the show is amazing, I think it is too edited, but I understand that was Madonna's decision so I have to live with that. I can't access the &#34;work shop/behind the scenes&#34; in the blu ray, but yes I can access it from the DVD which I bought for somebody else. Can somebody tell me if you are having the same issue please? By the way, in the song VOGUE when she says &#34;what are you looking at?&#34; Sounds way better in the DVD than the Blu Ray, just an observation.
B0089XH38M|1.0|Now my browser is AVG, not google like I want it.  Never had the &#34;option&#34; to NOT have it be my default browser.  Deleted it from my search tools, yet it still comes up.  Why???  HATE IT A LOT.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|Scenery spectacular, actors outstanding, and a love story (2 love stories actually) convincing and moving. A joy to watch again and again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is fun because you can build,eat for hp, and mobs are slower.<br />But still it's fun spiders are slower (thank Notch)
B000A2W1X2|5.0|The acting in this movie is superb, and the story is one of overcoming almost insurmountable odds to find forgiveness for the past and hope for the future.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works wonderfully.  Plug in and the device sets itself up.  Just need to download the apps for your PC/phone and you are ready to go.<br /><br />Been re-watching my Prison Break series off NEtflix on my Kindle Fire, it was nice to project it to my 60\\" screen with perfect picture quality and no lagging time at all.  Used my phone/kindle as the remote to pause or change episode.<br /><br />Then i was happy that i could play my movies i have stored on my external harddrive on my network.  Just click and drag your file to a chrome browser and tell it to broadcast on your chrome thingy and works wonderfully.<br /><br />This will be great for when i travel and want to watch a movie as long as the hotel i stay at has free wi-fi lol.<br /><br />For $35 its a smart investment
B003P9VZ0W|3.0|they are nice stickers but they are not reusable. once you stick them on the wall once and take them off, you can forget about reusing them or if you do they will fall off easily
0307120007|5.0|This book goes way back!  It was a baby shower staple for me even 30 years ago.  It still hasn't lost its ability to teach babies about some of the basic feels they encounter every day.  I'm still giving it to new parents and they still love it!  The spiral binding is fine, since the parents are using it with the child.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was the first fantasy book I read, based on recommendation of my friends. I could not stop reading until the last page.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|A great collection of poems, either as a companion book to the novel Peter the Darkened Fairytale or as a stand alone scattering of imaginative verses. William O'Brien's writing style is so mystical and nostalgic that you could almost imagine that these poems are spells or incantations from a bygone era. Wonderfully bizarre and enriching, this collection leaves your mind spinning off into a dark and fantastical land.
0738212415|5.0|I was very skeptical of this deceptively simple book, like some other readers. But Kistler's reference \\"cube\\" is very helpful, and so are his exercises on one- and two-point perspective. Today, I was in a cafe, and all of a sudden I saw it - the box in his exercise. The whole room was a three-dimensional box that I could now draw.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Since finding this bright, funny film, I've watched it several times.  Always laughing!  The American remake pales by comparison! Just thinking about it brings a smile!
B00005JKG9|4.0|A movie salesman in which salesman can relate.  The ups and downs of daily life for a man depending on leads and closing deals for his daily bread while dealing with overbearing bosses and cut throat co-workers.  I've worked in a few offices like this and it is a grind.<br /><br />The all-star cast makes this movie very enjoyable where a lesser cast would not be able to pull it off.  There are no special effects, beautiful women, explosions, or breathtaking scenery just a dark office and great acting performances.  My guess would be almost all of the cost to make the movie was in paying these leading men.<br /><br />This movie is rated R for the sole reason of language.  There are no sex scenes, violence (other than verbal) or gore just F bombs every other word than can be disturbing after a while.  The swearing is seemingly every other word and my guess is they had to do that to get the R rating and therefore more sales at the box office.  It's too bad Hollywood has to do this for sales but it is what it is.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|first book by this author and will definitly will look for more, and much better than many of the free books I have gotten.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|Only problem is not being Able to delete videos that have problems duplicates.  Otherwise is great. Would like to be able to organize them.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Great Book, fun read.  If you love cat's this is for you, you will enjoy this book. Must read this!
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Our children as just starting to appreciate the &#34;King of Pop&#34; and this give a nice breadth of his better hits.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful wardrobe and colorful lively characters that are so real I forget their actors, truly is a showcase; well written with cliff hangers that keep coming.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game loads quickly, i love how easy it is to use, the mini games are cool. i like how i get a new item w every expansion. i like how it still changes
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|You have nothing to lose and a world of joy to gain by reading this book. You'll laugh out loud and be inspired at the very least. So far I've only done the first two experiments...the awesome new job that I manifested is keeping me a little busy these days!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|My son loves this on the kindle. He watches skylander videos made by kids with their dads hunting for special characters.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Got this years ago when I purchased my first Hi-Fi VHS player.  Nice to have it again on Blu-Ray.  Looks and sounds great!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the sarcastic humor and life among the British Heirarchy.  I know this is &#34;a show&#34; but its how life really works there however the &#34;story&#34; of the show I'm sure is different then hollywoods story
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Late to the party with Imagine Dragons but I love every song on this album. Some are uplifting, some are just plain danceable.
B008469DGY|4.0|Good, simple and fun game. Easy to play. Great game to pass time. This game has good graphics and scenery.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  It's addicting.  The graphics aren't bad.  It freezes up a little.  Good zombie fun :-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy to read and wonderful story.  Every couple should read this trilogy, it will enhance their relationship!  I loved it and couldn't put it down!!
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|bought this for the ability to get the z headphone software download then found it would not work on my i pad because of a  IOS update that my I pad would not do then I could not get it to download for the I phone so I bought a nexus 7 pad and downloaded it and was only able play the demo and was not impressed by the music it is fine for the background of action for the movie which is what it was written for but musically it is not good
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Easy to read and wonderful story.  Every couple should read this trilogy, it will enhance their relationship!  I loved it and couldn't put it down!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The best and easiest way to peruse Ebay simple to use and well put together. I like it better than the webpage.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Easy to read and wonderful story.  Every couple should read this trilogy, it will enhance their relationship!  I loved it and couldn't put it down!!
1451648537|5.0|I'm kinda bias because I'm a huge fan of Apple and everything Steve Jobs but this book is such an inspiring tale and he was such an amazing human being. A must read for anyone who has ever been touch by an Apple product or just wanting to be entertained.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was fun to read and a great story!  It started off good and ended great!  I would read it again!
B005URRCUY|5.0|I really love the sound of the Black Keys. I haven't heard too much of their work before this album but El Camino, for me at least, is one of those albums where all the songs are listenable, unlike some other bands or artists who have a few good singles and the rest are crap.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.  I enjoy both the bingo and slots.  Like that I can play and do not need to continually purchase items to play.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Some of the upgrades, specifically scenes outside of planets where they have added color, sometimes change the entire scene, but if you don't like it, you still have the original. The new stuff does look good,  but sometimes I want to see what they did back in the 60's, so with this set, you can see it both ways, and very easy to change which version you are watching, while you watch! I haven't had time to watch all episodes to make sure there weren't any skips, but I've finished season 1 and no problems yet. Great investment here!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is simple but fun.Any fan of the original Mario Bros. games will surely enjoy playing this mobile knock-off.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|The high definition of the blu-ray is very nice, along with the bonus material.<br /><br />However, some scenes look like they had DNR (Dynamic Noise Removal) added to them, which took down the detail in some shots...<br /><br />I still give this a 4 out of 5 stars.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|Well done- well directed and believable acting.  Story is a slow-paced, reminding me of &#34;Lies my father told me&#34;, which I loved.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Blood song was a good read I really enjoyed. The ending was interesting and I look forward to reading more on this storyline
B007704HO6|3.0|Given the glowing reviews, I somehow expected more. Having always been an animal lover, particularly drawn to cats, I was really looking forward to this one. I understood that it was not going to be spectacular literary prose and its strength and weakness lay in the style of narrative from a broken, uneducated drug addict cleaning up his act. When I went through a divorce 12 years ago, my 2 cats provided comfort beyond what I imagined possible. I did not need human company, just the steadfast,  unjudgemental companionship of cats. James Bowen takes us through his dilemma of taking on the responsibility of caring for another creature when he is barely able to take care of, or provide for himself, extremely convincingly.<br /><br />The disappontment comes in that the book is repetetive and somewhat drawn out at times and feels like it was written by a 5th grader, even though there is the adult element of him being a homeless, recovering addict. As a so-called IT expert, he must have been aware that he would have made it onto the internet, or YouTube! At the very least, he knew that the Bob/James team was famous.<br /><br />By its very brevity, I got the feeling that he was going to try to turn this into a series from the outset. Hence, I don't think I will bother with the rest of the series. Keeping up to date with James and Bob's short stories would be too costly for what it offers. Not that I don't wish them continued success. That said, I would truly have loved a character like Bob to have entered my life!
0425263916|4.0|Absolutely just wow! A bit much of possessiveness but it was so thrilling to read none the less can't wait for the rest of the series!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and challenging.  The track is different each time keeping you on your toes.  The minions are adorable. Animation is top quality. Good for adults, children, everyone.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|It is a nice movie to watch.  A good feel good one and not too long either.  Well worth the time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very easy to use, and great display options. Have not had any issues with this app.  Love that you can use your own music as your alarm.  Highly recommend!
B00ESY77LO|1.0|I couldn't even finish it.  This is a film-maker who thinks that if you throw enough money and glitz at something, it'll turn out great.  He is mistaken.  The story-telling was confusing and hard to follow, even if you know the plot.  The actors seemed secondary to the director's overblown aesthetic.  Don't waste your time or money on this turkey.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A candid, heartwarming & inspiring read. I never never thought I'd feel such a kinship w/women of as divergent a background from me as to be incarcerated. I'd recommend it to anyone!
B003L20IHE|5.0|Once upon a time there was a young man who lived in a small fishing village. Although I haven't read the book it could very well start out in the classic fashion of fairy tales as this is a charming fantasy about a young man whose life is changed by an unfortunate accident.<br /><br />It is a story of love and loyalty and growing up; a story that involves life, death, and ghosts. The movie is set in a small coastal village with a dramatic coastline and beautiful forests. There is scene after scene of beauty which is a tribute to the film makers keen eye for beauty and the abundance of beautiful scenery in the setting where it was filmed in Eagle Harbour, West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.<br /><br />If you enjoy a romantic fairy tale fantasy then this one should be a natural for you.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|after purchasing this and putting it to use i have made to sure to take more than 10,000 steps per day!  easy to use and the app the goes with it is also straight forward!
B000ID37RM|5.0|From a racial perspective, I don't think there ever has been a book that's been more provocative, especially when you consider the meaningfulness of the civil rights movement. After reading the story, hopefully, we can learn to set aside our prejudices and learn focus our energies on valuing our individual differences.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I love both authors so it was simply impossible not to enjoy the book. It's funny and full of ironic observations (though I would not recommend it to some Christian orthodox due to the passages that mock the Bible and God's &#34;ineffable&#34; plan). The beginning was for me much more enjoyable - it was not so much packed with different events and I was able to appreciate the linguistic layer to a greater extend. A nice bonus is the pseudo-interview at the end concerning the writing of the book and the authors' discussion of each other.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Good movie.  Very good special effects.  Love the monkey.  There are times when you just want to have fun watching a movie and not have to try to figure it out.  This is one of those movies.  It takes you back to your childhood when good prevails over bad.  Well worth watching if you just want to relax and enjoy a movie.
B006IVBSBU|3.0|This movie is a bit disturbing if you let it get to you.  It's been a while since I've seen it, but I don't remember more than 1 or 2 scenes where there was any profanity.  There's no violence, obviously, but it is graphic in portraying the outbreak of the disease.  Simply because of the nature of this movie, it's not one I would watch very often.  I can say that.  And it is definitely not a family movie.  If you like these kinds of movies, this might be a good one-time watch for you, but I'm not sure it can have enough value to really be worth watching a whole lot.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie has 2 of the our best actors in it.  It is a long movie and one you really have to pay attention because if you don't you can quickly get lost.  I also feel that it is a movie that needs to be watched more than 1 time.  I'm hoping the next time I watch it I will get more understanding of it.  I gave it 4 stars because I did like it but I could also give it one or 2 stars because there area parts of the movie I really liked and other parts that completely lost me so that is why I say it needs to be watched more than once.  It needs to be watched with no interruptions also so you don't miss the flow.
B0001I561E|2.0|Of course, this series is a classic from our time; and when I was a kid I loved these movies.  To be sure, there's absolutely no profanity, violence, or sex.  That is not where I feel like this movie gets into trouble.<br /><br />As a Christian, I believe firmly in the scriptures command that magic and sorcery is evil and is not to be accepted in any way whatsoever, and think this series does nothing more than dull our senses and make us comfortable with &#34;magic&#34; by believing it is innocent, and, even, &#34;child's play&#34;.<br /><br />I've had friends justify watching more serious portrayals of magic by saying &#34;well, nothing's wrong with Aladdin, so...&#34;  And I've seen the effects of deeper immersion into these things.<br /><br />The scripture warns us to stay far away from anything that has to do with magic for a reason.  I heed that warning now.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Cried cried cried....good stuff.  I loved the dog who played the part of Hachi.  He seemed very much like the dog he played.
B000WZONL0|5.0|Acting is fantastic, directing great, the story is very touching, and it's very clean with absolutely no profanity, cussing, or sex (obviously).  It's not too slow, and I think it did a great job trying to portray the story of the life it was telling.  Well worth watching!
0316143472|5.0|I enjoy David Sedaris' writings; I laugh out loud and really enjoy myself during my reading sessions. This is not the first time I have read his books. Nor will it be the last. He is a terrific story teller with both hilarious and poignant details of his life.
B005LAIIS0|2.0|The whole movie your hoping they make it or that you see them fight a wolf or something. You never really see them fight a wolf and everyone dies
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|That voice, what's not to like!!! Some of those songs, I listen to them over and over again!! Different and unique.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read this while on vacation and it was great. Short and plenty if places to stop so I could drink more rum. I liked the different accounts and the way the author wove a few together to tell the story. Very enjoyable.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This was one fun ride. I did not even know that it existed. The Studio and producers must not have spent a dime on promoting it. This was well directed, had a coherent story line (for it's Genre) and was well executed. Karl Urban must have practised Stallone's mouth, cause if you pay attention & compare, it certainly has that &#34;Stallone Look&#34;.  I know that is no big deal, but I do not think it was an accident.  I'll call it attention to detail, because that is about all you see of his face.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the non stop, well choreographed action scenes.  TRULY much better than the Original. If you like this kind of Movie, You will enjoy this one.
B009LDD22U|5.0|Devout Big Bang Theory fan, and this is awesome! Nothing wrong with the discs, and priced great for just being released.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|This app keeps freezing up my Kindle Fire HD. It's not even working anymore. It's too bad cuz my kid loves taking pictures and videos with the Kindle. Junk!
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|This is a great movie, from start to finish. Great acting, story line, action and drama. A must see for any movie buff, and a true instant classic! I never get tired of watching this over and over again!!
B00DU16OJM|5.0|Great album start to finish. Sorry to say i was not familiar with Guy's work and i consider myself a country music fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting. For all ages. Never had a problem with it. Love challenging myself and others. Download and have fun.
B000TGCR3S|5.0|I love this anime. It's a little weird, but the animation, characters, music and story are perfect. I am very picky with anime, and have an awesome collection.I have purchased this dvd to give as a gift at least 5 times... it's been super cheap on amazon for years. Well worth it!!!!!
B000PKX2KA|1.0|Did five test runs letting it sit in open sky view for about an hour each.  Only one time it got a fix and took about 45 minutes.  Switched to a Garmin 18x and it gets a fix before the computer it's attached to boots.  Love my Garmin devices!
B005WMQ5R8|2.0|The animation was cool, the story was dumb. Not really quality anime. The DVD came in perfectly. That is all.
B002VISN9E|4.0|A compelling story, well written, easy to understand and follow, also brilliantly illustrated. I'd recommend to every child starting to read.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|As usual, studio ghibli nailed it! This movie was great. I especially loved the era appropriate sound track, very cool.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|This is good to have notes that I can write to I say it's good. I can write some more things on it and I think it's good.
B004DMIIVO|4.0|It was a cool movie, well done. A little on the slow side. Probably won't watch it again. Not that it was bad, just not that exciting.
B00E9PMMPI|2.0|I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid and I only saw the last portion of it, so I'll give a review of it when I see it.<br /><br />In the meantime...note to Warner Bros (I know I'm the millionth person to suggest this, but I will anyway):  How about Innerspace on Blu-Ray? It has the same motif and it's better all around.  And in what other film do you get comedy, science-fiction, drama, action and romance all in the same film?<br /><br />Certainly not in Fantastic Voyage.  Sorry Raquel:-(<br /><br />**UPDATE 8/5/15**<br /><br />OK.  Got to see the movie recently.  My rating changed.  It lost a star.<br /><br />Why don't I like this movie?  Let me tell you 'bout it...<br /><br />The breathtaking riding to the science facility scene, the heartstopping ride to the lab itself, the bloodcurdling exposition scene explaining what they're going to do, then there's the captivating shrinking to a smaller size, then, finally, the orgasmic shrinking to a microscopic size,  all without music.<br /><br />That's the first hour of the film.  I shut it off after that.  It wasn't worth seeing the rest.<br /><br />My rating stands.  Boring, overrated and I just don't care about the characters at all.  They're all plastic and two dimensional.  Even Raquel is made plain looking and uninteresting--a feat that's impossible ordinarily.<br /><br />Innerspace is now available on Blu-Ray and I bought it recently.  Highly recommended.  It's a far, far better movie.<br /><br />As I said before:  Sorry Raquel...
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Hail to the king is a great album. Can not stop listening to it!! Glad to hear rock is still alive and kicking.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I LOVE IT THIS SEASON WAS SAD WITH THE DEATHS OF 2 CHARACTERS BUT IT WAS GREAT, CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON
B00A81MV3U|4.0|We watched this on cable, and felt it would be good addition to our DVD collection.  You may also like this one.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Mark Haddon has indeed depicted a persona's thought , emotions and personality stereotypes of an autistic young adolescent who is highly motivated to achieve his goals. The caricature of the main character is so adequately personalized and has used his vivid imagination to put himself in the shoes of the character. This  book  gives  immense insight for the  mental health professionals and specifically those who help the special need children to  understand their mental status and the stereotypical nuances which other wise not understood by many.<br />I do congratulate him for writing such a book with such good insight .
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Great movie for us &#34;seniors&#34;.  This is based on a &#34;real&#34; place in England, so if you are a music lover, add this one.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|In this century there are many many sweet talking, with good PR,  going about waiting to bait ones own so called well wishers . The book was interesting and gives immense insight into the so called insignificant people in our life wa9iting for an opportunity to make a mark for themselves without many scruples .<br />A must book to read to know the dynamics of these people like drivers , servants whom we take for granted considering them to be imbeciles and with no confidence. Arvind Adiga has warned  the people to be aware of people around one self  because you do not know when they will strike you in the pursuit of their ambition.<br />It was a good reading &#62; I liked it
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|If you do not make strategic moves from the very beginning of this game, you will get bored quickly. Or you will have to spend real cash to keep the game going above a snail's pace.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is one of Megadeth's all-time greatest albums. I've listened to this one for decades. Definitely recommend to all other Metal Heads.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I am so glad I ignored all of the negative reviews that popped up when this was the FAOTD!<br /><br />I had to keep playing this game until the end.  I couldn't leave it for more than a few hours before I had to go back and try to get even further.  I made it to the end, thought I was done, but started finding challenges and \\"mini games\\".  I am also now going back through the levels I couldn't get spare balls on the first time around and am still having fun.
B006UG90RM|4.0|still alive and rockin' evh still on the top, the best riffs ever! van halen still my best band but i prefared sammy hagar and michael anthony on the line up.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My son LOVES this show! The few times I have sat down with him I've really enjoyed it too. Highly recommend~
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Acting is superb.  Captures the era.  Be certain to see the first in the series before &#34;Elizabeth the Goldenage.&#34;  It is equally compelling.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Actually I think the hook is based on deep imbedded grief any of us would have with the loss of a child.<br />I liked the suspense of the plot.<br />One scary movie !
B0006LZPLC|5.0|My third pair of Keens since the early 2000s.  My latest pair was purchased in 2006 and lasted until 2013.  They were still wearable, but the tread was worn pretty slick.  Great, comfortable, casual shoes...perfect for walking the dog, going to the store, even riding a bike for a short distance, etc.  Customer for life!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I really enjoy playing this fun game! It is good to pass the time without raising your blood pressure..  ;◆}
B006BAEQB2|4.0|This was my introduction to Philippa Gregory and it captivated me. I have read a second and look forward to the third novel.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I have read Peter: A darkened fairy tale and this collection of poems inspired by the story are beautifully written and conjure up a myriad of wonderful images and characters.<br />Even if you haven't read the fairy tale you cannot fail to find these poems enchanting as the title suggests. Having read the previous book it was lovely to have this companion to bring back to life all the amazing creatures met in the tale. This is a great book to dip into and the poems will immediately transport you into another realm.<br />If I had to ask for one thing extra, it would be illustrations. Not that the author doesn't create an excellent picture in the reader's mind, because he does, but an illustrated background for these fantastic words would make it even more special.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|A quickly shipped, apple branded adapter for thunderbolt to Ethernet conversion.  Unit was in stellar condition, worked as expected, and arrived earlier than I expected it would.  For a \\"pre-owned\\" adapter, saving 40% was well worth it, considering I needed to buy \\"thunderbolt to everything else I own adapters\\", and \\"mini-display to everything else...\\"  No point to pay a premium for a new one especially since these haven't been out for too long and haven't had years to get funky.  Recommended seller.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|If you enjoy a good psychological thriller with a serial killer thrown in for good measure then this is the book for you. From the first page this novel had me totally absorbed as it moved between the obsessive detective intent on catching the killer responsible for her father's murder, and the strange character of Ben who you wouldn't wish to meet on the street at night.<br />It is easy to become complacent and imagine the ending will be predictable but this is one of the reasons this book is so engaging.<br />All along the reader doubts their own theories as we share in Ben's own thoughts about whether he is responsible for the deaths occurring around him and how much is down to the man he sees in the mirror looking back at him.<br />The characters are brilliantly created along with their warped natures, Ben's mother and his girlfriend, Natalie, included.<br />And the ending is cleverly mastered with the reader getting the impression that no amount of money is going to ensure Eve is given any kind of compensation for her predicament.<br />A fantastic read!
B00ARF92HK|2.0|Dredd is okay if you want to watch something that is totally non-plausible. It is overly graphic with scenes where the main character dodges bullets that others around him don't and where he gets shot, &#34;thru and thru,&#34; but does not die. This was on my list of movie to purchase on BluRay, but not anymore. It's not worth the movie to buy it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book. Talk about suspense, I couldn't put it down for longer than a few hours. Even when I wasn't reading, I was thinking about what was going on in Amy's or Nick's mind. I'm looking forward to reading more Gillian Flynn!
038533348X|5.0|This book is a waste of time, but it is short, and you would waste the time anyway, so wtf.
0930289234|5.0|Great story, much better than the movie, the art stile is a little dated for my taste, but I didn't bought the watchmen for the art, I got it for the plot.  Recomend this to any Fan
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a wonderful read. The characters are deeply meaningful and beautifully depicted with honesty and emotion. There are just enough twists and turns to keep the pages turning. The ending is lovely and just different enough to be unexpected. Highly recommend this beautiful story.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|The audio is terrible on this disc.  I think this is consistent with all the blu-ray and DVD discs for the MDNA concert.  I couldn't even finish watching the blu-ray.  There is no audio coming from the from right and back right speakers.  The audio is spread between left front and center.  Very dissapointing.  Will ask Amazon for a refund!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Love reading a book that also teaches and makes us think. Good plot and found it hard to stop reading. This is the first Dan Brown book for me and I will be looking for another to read soon.
B009PLKCEE|3.0|I have a suspicion that this one alomst killed my Acer A510 - had to reset the poor thing to factory settings to stop continiuos bootloop. KF, onthe other hand has yet to show any signs of cracking
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is an intriguing work of art I loved it. The story about Lesiel and Max and her foster family shows that everyone can be human even in the worse of times.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally closure! Nice pseudo twist ending,.. Very good! Well done Sanderson... I wouldn't mind a follow up that is centered on the Seanshan and Matt!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME! The updates take a wile to come but its still cool. This game is so wurth buying. Lucly its not more money...(I think it should be more)
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I did like the game. It was fun but can be annoying due to some of the timing aspects. It was worth the money.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This is a well written and entertaining book.  The characters are people you care about and would like to know.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|It was lots of fun but some challenges require timing which can become stressful if you are looking for a light game. It was more fun than Cut the Rope but very much a game along the same lines. It was worth the money.
0736092269|5.0|this book shows almost every workout and the individual muscles used in each. great buy for any person looking to focus on their workouts.
1932100660|5.0|I LOVED this book. It was a great follow up to watching Forks Over Knives. This had all of the data to follow up the eating program.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was a great movie? I guess you have to have so many words to rate this so here you go!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|First, I have to admit that I have and always will be a Star Trek fan, from the original series to the movie reboots. I was so pleased with this movie and the quality of the video. Abrams has managed to maintain the heart of the rebooted Star Trek without changing the characters drastically. So glad to see Roddenberry's ideals continued and I'm thrilled to see that the heart of Star Trek is still beating so strongly for yet another generation to enjoy! Excellent film. If only a new series would return . . .
B0015AARJI|2.0|One of the pads on the joysticks was missing. This was not in the description. Other than that it worked fine.
B003WQT2YY|4.0|It's still a good film, but this version removes the \\"less is more\\" aspect that was so effective in \\"Amadeus\\" (an aspect I didn't realize existed until I saw the director's cut).  To borrow from the script, \\"there are too many notes.\\"  We don't need to see a detailed chronicling of Mozart's self-destruction.  In fact, in the original, it seemed Salieri himself drove this downward spiral rather than simply being a contributing factor.  I see now that the original also had a kind of vagueness that enhanced the mysteriousness of the story and made it more dramatic and believable.  Especially since much of the detail can only be guessed at, leaving more to the imagination of the viewer helped avoid over-fictionalizing and over-explaining.  I think many film buffs automatically conclude that a director's cut is naturally superior, but that's not always the case.  As most people know, filmmaking is a collaborative effort, and while directors are usually considered the overriding force in the creation of a film, often the contributions of editors, producers and \\"evil\\" studio execs do have a positive impact on the final product.  (Directors are especially \\"godlike\\" in the U.S.  There's an old saying about whose role is most important: in France it's the playwright, in England it's the actor, in America it's the director.)<br /><br />Anyway, if this version had been released originally, I don't think it would've received as much acclaim or been as popular.  Like authors, directors need really good editors!  Like chefs, they need to cut out unnecessary fat from the meat of their story.  Otherwise, we're left with an unpalatable mass without much texture.  What's worse, though, is going back and adding a bunch of fat to an already exemplary meal.  \\"Amadeus\\" was perfect as it was; we didn't need another helping.
B00BFIFIPS|4.0|Excellent quality for the great price. I do not regret buying this great product. Recommend it to everyone out there
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I heard there making a second can't wait till realese. They should make a third.New teloport toys out September 13
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was fun, witty, romantic, and sexy all in one. Conner was a wonderful character and I fell in love with him very quickly. :)
B001XJEKGC|5.0|The concert footage was just great and the music was fabulous as you would expect from these two great musicians<br />.
B004MPJZ1O|1.0|I ordered this without seeing that it was 1978.  I don't know about the new one, but this is just plain stupid.<br />I wasn't revolted or outraged by this movie. I have seen a lot of movies, so wasn't surprised by nudity and violence.<br />The reviews are much better than what you get; a silly, stupid, boring bunch of nonsense. For one thing, why<br />didn't this woman just leave if she was renting this cabin?  She could have gotten help instead of going crazy.<br />Oh yes, the revenge thing, ok.  I just didn't feel anything except boredom.  Thanks, Mary
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watch this season. You won't regret it.  You'll laugh; you'll cry; you'll want to punch Obrien and Thomas.  It's good stuff!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|One of the best Star Trek movies out there. This is a must watch.<br /><br />The story picks up in time before the original Start Trek started, so that needs to be understood at first. Essentially Captain Kirk before he gets the Enterprise.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is great fun you do use energy in the game but it refills faster than other games with the same thing and it means you don`t play on it too long. great that it is FREE too a must have game..
B00BUKODDO|3.0|Gary Burton has been one of my favourites ver since the 70ties. This is a solid album but I'm not surprises or flabbergasted.<br />Nothing new under the sun so to speak .
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like the different gift that keeps me motivated to keep playing. This game is so addictive in a good sense.
B006LL5W6O|5.0|I like the interpretation of Red Riding Hood, Hansel & Gretel; Rapunzel. Interesting action/storyline. Glad Matt Damon chose this work to stretch his acting skills. An early work for Heath Ledger; a glimpse into what a fine actor he was/ would have become if not for his unfortunate demise.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really like it. It challenges the mind and keeps you busy for a while. I couldn't stop playing. I hope that there will be a sequel. I would love to continue this game.
B00860YICC|4.0|Got this as a gift for a couple that cruises a lot.  Have not presented it to them as of this review.  Have seen this DVD before and it is a really nice movie with great music.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|We really enjoy following the lives of these people--the servants and the served; witnessing how their lives intersect and depend on one another.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|THANK YOU AMAZON FOR BEING HTERE WHEN I REALLY REALLY NEEDED AND FANTASTIC MOVIE TO WATCH WHERE I NEEDED IT. RLS3
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book has definetely been a fun read.  I really enjoyed the first book in the selection and was excited to read this one.  I can't wait until the third one comes out!  It kept me guessing.  Just when I thought I had it figured out, I would be thrown for another loop.  Definetely enjoy the characters and how honest and real they are.  They make mistakes and pay the punishments for them.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Loved it. Closed-captioned on every bonus. Keep it up. Hope next season will be cooler and keep all CC on all bonuses.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Even with pop up ads (which are not that bad and very easy to either watch or dismiss), this is a fast solitaire game that most all card players will enjoy!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Great game to play. The graphics are superb. The music is invigorating: makes you wanna drive.<br />I connected my kindle to my big screen tv via hdmi and play this game. My kindle becomes a steering wheel n it so much fun driving. Great game. Totally worth the price.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought two of these as soon as they were announced (with the Netflix promo codes), one for my mother and one for my father, in hopes that they would leech off my Netflix account and embark in their newfound source of entertainment. To date, both Chromecasts have been used no more than a dozen times, and a vast majority of which by me.<br /><br />It's hard to make old dogs learn new tricks, I suppose. Nevertheless if Chromecast allowed wireless display mirroring (so my mother could play her games on her TV, or my dad could better see the ESPN app) or, better yet, be installed in between a cable box (or whatever is in the primary HDMI input) and the TV and override that input when in use (so you didn't have to manually switch inputs, which neither of my parents seem to be able to do without great difficulty) then maybe my parents would get more use out of it.<br /><br />For me, I have an Xbox 360 and PC hooked up to my TV. The Chromecast doesn't really make my TV any smarter, or in any way more connected to the services I use or to my Android devices. And that's a shame.<br /><br />I'd love to play games on my TV (wirelessly) using my Android tablet and wireless PS3 controller, for example, but I do understand we are a bit away from that happening. Meantime, I still think this is an amazing product because it's the cheapest way to turn dumb TVs into smart TVs, and I look forward to the greatness that will inevitably come from it.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Loved the lead actors - good and bad guys - and the progression of the judges' partnership. Story held true to the character, who does not compromise the law. Awesome little film for any lover of good sci-fi stories.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book was incredible. Absolutely incredible. Amazing characters, great page turning suspense.  Phenomenal story. The movie with Tom Hardy next year is going to be great too
B00CNGA1PS|4.0|This app works pretty well. I never have a problem streaming or downloading certain podcasts like I had with other apps in the past. the only negative is that some of the buttons aren't self explanatory.
B003DWU98U|5.0|What a great movie. It is by far one of my favorites. A true Classic and not to be missed. Get ready for a roller coaster of emotions and excellent acting from Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Besides de beautiful setting, the interaction among the &#34;people of Candleford&#34; how they resolved their differences, etc. The strong character of the main actors
B00AHHODH2|4.0|It seemed to be a nice approach, however, it didn't capture my interest entirely, most like just me.  Don't let it discourage any reader, it has a nice message.
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|I wish it had an easy way to enter recurring events or maybe I have not found the the key.
B00AVXVQGI|5.0|This is my favorite book. Persuasion is a story of lost love, regret, sorrow and then found love, forgiveness and rejoicing. The main character Anne is just unforgettable. The only negative thing I would say is that the ending reads as if the author forgot to finish. Fortunately the Masterpiece theater renditions make up for this lack.
B009LGO88E|4.0|This makes an already large system even larger. It loses a star only because Nintendo refused to add a second analogue on the XL. For this accessory on it's own, it's very comfortable but is also very large. Can also confirm it works on US systems (these are not region protected).
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|After reading a quarter of the book,<br />I thought it was too slow, too many<br />little happenings that do not seems to<br />keep the reader in the story, missing<br />intensity. Was disappointed.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|but with tennis. fun enough but nothing amazing. I probably would not pay for it but since I got it for free I'll still play it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great read! I got so into it and read it within a week as a result. Let your imagination go and visualize the characters in the capital. Very enjoyable!
1481130331|3.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners casts light on a lesser known part of Central Europe, Slovakia, and its involvement in WWII. Using a well-chosen set of diverse characters as the victims and bystanders of racial politics it offers great insights into the history of that era. Well researched and accurate in the setting the historical part of this book is immaculate and very impressive.<br /><br />The characterisation however does not pay off until a little later into the book when the wheels of politics force them into action and out of their home. The number of people coming in and out of the Weissensteiners life is at times distracting and seemed unnecessary for the plot while at others their presence brought some fascinating perspectives into play after all.<br /><br />I am not surprised to learn that this is Fischer's first novel. Some stylistic issues should be overcome in his further writing. As story teller, historian and creator he has certainly potential and if you can neglect these minor caveats you will find an intriguing novel and a rather entertaining story that comes together nicely and ends on a high.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best book ever!! I read it in two days bc I couldn't put it down :) read it !! It's amazing
1484156005|3.0|Sebastian by Christoph Fisher is an accurate portrayal of Vienna in its last days of royal glory. The breaking down of the Empire as the individual parts draw away from it is reflected in the chaos of the characters that Fischer brings into the story. Sebastian could almost stand for Austria as he is being deserted, amputated and left to fight for himself.<br /><br />Instead of just doom and gloom alone Fisher adds a cast of colourful characters to the story that force Sebastian to grow up and make the most out of his life. These characters are also heavily laden with symbolism and seem to come from all walks of Viennese life, helping to illustrate the historical background while making this a great family epic with spice and bite.<br /><br />Albeit lack of direction at times and confusion over where the story is going, particularly when one narrative takes the story away from Vienna to Galicia, it does all come together in a positive and constructive way that shows the way forward for the nation and the family.<br /><br />I commend the author for this intelligent book. In the context of the series it works with similar themes and similar type of characters, although they are this time taken to a more innocent and naïve time. In the previous book the family is torn apart by prejudice and stupid ideology, in this the problem arises from lack of confidence and paranoia. Those reasons could almost be symbolic again for the reasons why the wars broke out in the first place.<br /><br />Maybe not as polished a book as I would have liked it to be this is a good story with a lot of depth and commendable ideas.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Funny show.  Wish I had cable so I didn't have to buy it here, but it works so yeah enjoy.  I recommend it
B004KB8P3E|4.0|Very well done. Madonna is a very good actress. The movie inspired me to understand the modern history of Argentina. Checking out Eva Peron online gave me a better appreciation for the movie.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This movie follow the historical viewpoint.  All the actors were good.  Now when there is nothing good on TV, I always go to<br />my collections of westerns.

B000FCK65W|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It had the right amount of detail and speech. I could picture the characters and what they were doing in my mind htopughiput the entire story. The beginning was slightly uninteresting but as most books start off like that, I still thought it was very good. The characters themselves were also very well formed and had good personalities. Overall, very well written and dry enjoyable. I recommend it to all girls.
B000I9X6HW|4.0|its a good movie for x men fans and i liked it a lot  even tho some one dies (spoiler alert)
0670026638|5.0|A \\"Tale for the Time Being\\" is obviously a labor of love, respect, and humanity. It is a bow to the infinite sangha of beings. Ruth Ozeki has woven two intricately entangled stories into a web of radiance, composed of equal parts wisdom and compassion. The author's skill and craftsmanship is apparent on every page: excellent narrative, sense of place, dialog, mystery, and purpose. It's the forward momentum of the tale's purpose which sets this book apart from so many other works of fiction appearing today. That the book also weaves the teachings of Zen Master Dogen into the narrative is another of its unique features to be savored. And then there's Schr&ouml;dinger's cat! Somehow, perhaps as a function of the quantum field, it all makes sense. More evidence of the author's skillful means.<br /><br />This is a good book. And that's saying something!
B001NLKT60|5.0|If you're reading this book, you probably liked the first one (or at least the movie). More of the same here. This is a story well told, and the pacing was excellent. When things were happening, they were moving; when details/background were being explained, it moved slower, like real life. You do get the sense, though, that Sweden only has about a hundred people in it.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Good acting, descriptive, leaves you wanting more and true to fashion for the iconic series. Would recommend anyone interested in  a well thought out plot.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I went out and bought the DVD of Star Trek Into Darkness the day of release and I was not disappointed in the least. It is just as good as the first Star Trek with the new cast. I am one of those that will not go to the theatre to see movies.. I wait til it comes to dvd to enjoy it at Home. It was fantastic to watch. I was pleased that there were some suprises in the movie which I did not expect..I will not mention them here because I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Loved the characters and how they interact with each other. With the reboot I still have to get used to Spock and Uhura as a \\"Couple\\". So if you liked the first one I highly recommend this movie.

B000Y1ZXUM|3.0|[[ASIN:B0077BI80E Shakira: Oral Fixation Tour [Blu-ray]]]<br />The Shakira Oral Fixation tour Blu Ray has a decent image, great PCM sound quality and good choreography. Shakira does her signature hip gyrations and is very sexual in her performance. But mixes it with heart warming thanks and statements about how much she loves her band members. The songs are fun too and technically the music is good. The problem however is that nearly the entire show has been sound replaced and lip synced in the studio in post. You can tell right away that you are not at all hearing live sound or anything close to it which causes a feeling of disconnect and mistrust with the performance. They should have just had better production sound recording and given us a live sound, because, I hope and assume that Shakira can actually sing!

B00CFYAT6O|5.0|This is a more mature, yet still authentic performance by a band that shows both their high-level musicianship and the raw emotion of traditional blues.  There isn't a throw-away cut on this CD.  Love this, and now start the wait for the next one.  I cannot imagine anyone who likes blues-rock being in any way dissatisfied with &#34;Made Up Mind.&#34;
B00DQVST76|5.0|The MDNA World Tour is the Queen Of Pop's strongest live show since 2004's highly controversial Reinvention Tour. Sleek and artistic in both concept and execution, this provocative and forward-thinking show brings Madonna back to form. The DVD is masterfully edited for maximum impact. Everyone needs to watch this!
B00E1LAS42|5.0|Loved the book! Love the movie just as much. A true dive into 1920's culture & into Fitzgerald's creative mind!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|perfect entertainment!!  Really enjoyed it  I am ordering season 2 and 3 today.  Want to see it all in order
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The movie itself is awesome of course, and one of the best Treks ever.  However, to help those who didn't originally see the 3D version, I think it is one of the best done 3D movies I have seen, and its rendition to Blu-ray is also very well done.  As long as your 3D system works well, I think this 3D movie in your collection will be one of the best done.  Definitely worth the extra expense.
055358202X|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much, especially the way the characters' paths are crossing without their knowledge. Still, I missed story lines involving some of my favorite characters.  Too bad about Brienne and Pod.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This cd is different then any other album that they have released. I loved the self titled album and the waking the fallin.  this album is leanig towards 80's metal. I highly recommend this if you like 80's metal and a7x.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Makes me fall asleep quick and easy. I love the range of sounds.  I highly recommend to anyone suffering from insomnia.

1582701709|5.0|This book has really changed the way I think.  I don't believe it can cure cancer or bring world peace, but what does it hurt to think positively.  If you just apply it to your everyday life I think it can really make a difference, it has for me.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I bought this album after hearing only one of their songs only one time. It's not that this one song I heard was really that good. It is that there was something different in the music, in the voices, that I hadn't really heard before. And when I heard the rest of the tracks I was so relieved that my money hadn't gone to waste. This is really a fantastic album, and I hope that many more are to come from these guys.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show. Highly addictive. Pretty hot season finale. Beam me up Scottie... Be seeing you soon.  Can't wait for the next season.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|After hearing and downloading multiple tracks from this album, I thought to myself, there's no way you can't like this. So I went ahead and scored this deal. The entire album, literally every track, I like. Which is odd because there are even some songs by my favourite bands that I don't like. So go ahead, buy this. Please. Because if you like two or three of the songs, chances are, you're gonna like the rest, too.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I have no problems with the build, quality, or brand of this backpack because its great.  It has enough room for a DSLR and 2 smaller lenses plus misc items.  Zippers work good and there is enough padding to protect all your equipment.  However, my only main problem is when i tried to put this backpack on... It is too small!  I let out the straps almost completely and able to slide on the backpack.  But, connecting the center clip together across your chest is impossible.  I'm 5-10 and could not clip it on.  Neither can my wife who's 5-3.  I ended up returning it.. with $7 return fee and bought a Lowepro Flipside instead which fits average size adults fine.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|There is just something about Wesley's voice that makes me swoon just a little bit. Not only the voice that we hear, but the way the words are written. What these five artists have put together is really something special, and I hope they stick around for a long time. Some of the songs are relatable, and then there are some that just tell the story way too well. The stories they sing come to life when they are put to music. This is really quite a beautiful track list.
B005DZMODI|5.0|this was a great idea, combining 2 legends, resulting in a terrific compilation. i'd buy #2 if it is ever made
B003EV6DBM|5.0|There is nothing sadder than seeing your Doctor regenerate, especially when that Doctor is David Tennant. No one could put a candle to what he did for the show. The way Tennant portrayed the iconic character was just pure genius. So when this young guy appears and says that he's replaced the man, I'm not tempted to like him at all. And I didn't. Not for a while anyways. But with some Steven Moffat writing and the lovely Karen Gillan at his side, this young charmer put forth the excitement and curiosity of a child to make the hundred years old man seem young again. When Matt Smith came on to the show, I knew it was for the long haul. He brought with him something much like Tom Baker. He is just such a fun Doctor and this season made me love him for that. Each episode will bring you closer and closer to these characters until Steven Moffat, the genius that he is, takes them away and replaces them with a new lot, eager to prove you wrong, to show you that yes, you can love the new guy too.
B002LHTRV8|4.0|I felt like this movie was a little predictable and a little boring at times, but I also found myself chuckling every once in a while. It's very well done, when concerning acting and everything. If you like psychological intrigue or are a hard-core Johnny Depp fan, I highly recommend.
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book.  Such a great reminder that there is a deeper purpose to what sometimes feels like an aimless life.  I have recommended it to several friends who also found it fascinating.
B009RX85N0|5.0|really enjoyed series 2 excellent character and plot development and visually more appealing. looking forward to series 3 and beyond.
0385528787|5.0|This was an absolutely riveting trilogy by Atwood. I loved the writing style in this finale, told in three ways - when Toby and Blackbeard tell stories to the Crakers, Zeb's story told through conversation between Toby and Zeb, and then the \\"what's happening now\\".<br /><br />The ending was a little bit sad, but it also seemed perfect and I am satisfied with it. Just as with \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\", I am now imagining what happened afterward - what was that smoke? do the \\"two-skinned\\" humans live and reproduce? what are the Craker-human hybrids like? There are so many questions but I love that this book has me thinking about all this.<br /><br />Atwood is a wonderful storyteller. Now I'm off to read some of her other books!
B008476HBM|5.0|What can I say? It's a classic. The writing is amazing, the jokes are funny and Austen knows her stuff.

0307474275|4.0|1) Plot (5 stars) - After an elderly curator at the Louvre is murdered, Harvard symbologist Robert Langston is called upon to help solve the case, only to discover the roots of the murder reach back through a secret history all the way to Jesus.  Brown can certainly keep you reading.  He is a master of the 3 page chapter that starts simple, introduces a conflict, raises tension, then cuts off at a cliffhanger that forces you to another storyline you don't want to be in until, hey, there's some conflict here too, some tension, a cliffhanger, ad infinitum, technique.  The results are that you're almost done with the bag of candy before you know what you've done.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - There's the smart, brave, good-morals lead; the requisite love interest who joins up with him; and the constant game of \\"who's the real antagonist\\" (is it this shady friend, oh no that guy just said something suspicious, etc.).  All the characters were fine and come complete with the formulaic unresolved issues in their backstories that they are dealing with in the present, but none of their present personalities or challenging pasts were especially unusual or memorable.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - The message that Jesus could have married Mary Magdalene and had offspring, and that there's been a 2,000 year cover up to keep power in the male dominated church and away from the sacred feminine, and what that means for our perspective of the world was fascinating.  Whether or not you agree with the conspiracy, it was explored in extraordinary detail while still managing to be packaged in easy to swallow and understandable bites.  Which is a pretty good trick to pull off.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - It's readable enough for me to not skim through 500 pages, but I didn't mark any sentence as especially poetic or insightful or clever.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The midnight dash through Paris and beyond was done with enough detail to let me imagine being there, but not too much to slow the quick action.  Moreover, Brown thoroughly researched his locales, which added a layer of verisimilitude to the tale, and overcame some of the simple writing.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I'd recommend it.  This is a great ride where you'll also learn some pretty interesting counter-theories about the history of Christianity.  That said, be prepared for ho-hum characters and prosaic writing.not too much to slow the quick action.

B003PBB4ME|4.0|OK, so the video review calling this `rubbish' is a bit harsh.  It obviously doesn't snug up well with his camera, but I think for most people (for $20!) this will do the trick very nicely.  I just received mine today, and my Sony PJ790v tightens up very nice.  I paid a small fortune for this camera and the `hot shoe' does not accept my Rode VideoMic (or any other standard shoe mount device).  I purchased a so-called adapter that was too small to lock into the shoe mount, but this device works perfectly.  It IS made of plastic, so the reviews claiming it's \\"cheap\\" or \\"flimsy\\" must have expected a piece of steel for $20.  I've put a good amount of force on it, and it does flex a bit, but for 90% of users out there, with a small camera, this device will be more than worth the money.  For me, with my recent camera upgrade, I've lost a universal shoe mount, and a top-side handle on my camera.  This device solves both of those problems.  I can now mount my microphone AND `grab' my camera with one hand and swoop and swing in all directions.  If you have a large camera, or a really heavy camera, this isn't for you.  But for those of us with smaller equipment, this is a godsend...and did I say it's only $20?  The only reason I don't give this 5-stars, is because the lock-knob on the underneath is recessed and doesn't fit down on my tripod.  I'll have to rig something for that.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Not the type of book I usually read, but this was very hard to put down. I bet this will be a movie before long.
B00C6BACF4|3.0|Very funny movie.The only dislike I have is the digital copy in a codes download and not on a disk digital copy. It took too long for me to download on my computer.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have used this for over a year.  It is excellent due to it's flexibility.  I create categories of information I need and then load the information.  Great for grocery lists for instance.  It is available on multiple devices connected to Kindle and Amazon so.  It can update in multiple locations.  Simply by asking it to Sync.  Once I accidentally deleted an entry on my phone.  I put it down without a sync.  Logged into my Kindle, opened the app and Synced thus up-dating and retrieving the information on the phone.<br /><br />The only problem has been carrying the phone in my pocket.  The input program activates and writes on at tab.  100 letters inserted in the middle of a note is a mess.

1402790546|5.0|Deighton really does his homework. He imparts more about war, airplanes, flight crews, bombers and bombing raids than a participant might know.<br />Then weaves these facts around characters and a story line that takes the reader from exhilaration to heartbreak, and back. The heroism, the<br />human stories, the mistakes are all vividly portrayed. Bravo!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Very unusual for me to get addicted to a TV series, but this one totally pulled me in.  Can't wait for season 3.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Carl Sagan's story lends itself to cinema like a duck to water.  It contains just about everything a movie can hold for us and then more.  The last 30 seconds of this film, yes those same 30 seconds just before the credits begin to roll, when most people have intellectually and emotionally checked out, are mind-blowing!  For those with eyes to see and ears to hear, this film is easily in their top 10 of all time.  This is pure cinema folks that entertains, teaches and forces us to feel about our existence.  I would pay a lot to see this film again in my favorite viewing seat in my favorite theater from a clean 35mm release print.  For now, I am very happy to have it on BluRay and screen it on my large HD TV.  And for under $10!  Quack, quack!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|mystery, intrigue, conspiracy, a history lesson, it's everything that made Dan Brown famous. A good read if you like his work.

B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I'm glad I got this for free, because it's just not fun. I previously bought [[ASIN:B00EQ0CKRQ Asphalt 8: Airborne (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] (or rather, it's equivalent on Google Play, since I have a Nexus 7). Same price, much better graphics and gameplay.<br /><br />I only tried the first race, which was a time trial, and found the car hard to control. The graphics were okay as long as I didn't get too close to the trees, which happened often, and sometimes my car even passed through them to the other side of the 3D scene, and that looked pretty bad.<br /><br />The short of it is, I think it's a mediocre indie offering. It's not terrible, but I don't see a particular reason to buy it considering that more professional racing games don't cost more, unless you really hate the idea of optional in-game purchases that games such as Asphalt 8 offer.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is what blu-ray is all about. Do yourself a favor and go out and purchase a 3-D HD televison straight away. I went to my brother's house who just purchased a new 3-D HD TV and we watched this together. Our jaws dropped. I had read that this was one of the best 3-D movies put on Blu-ray to date and it is! Also, the soundtrack is fantastic. It's in 7.1 surround and it gets your heart pumping. We only have a sound bar and separate sub woofer and it just blew us away. It's the best soundtrack that I have every heard to date. If I had room, I would purchase a home theater surround system because of this movie. I can't believe this movie did not make money but I hope with the high DVD-Blu-ray sales that it had, it made a little. I wish they would do another.<br />As for the acting, the main actors were just fine. They were perfect in their roles. It was well done considering the \\"small\\" budget they had to work with.<br />As for the filming, the slo-mo and the violent scenes used rich color saturation combined with high-speed photography which produced a visual treat. I've never seen that before.<br />The blu-ray comes with both 3-D and regular all in one disc. I have a Sony Playstation 3 so it is compatible with 3-D. I've also watched it in 2-D and it's great too. When it's time for me to buy a new HD TV, I will purchase one that has 3-D as an option. It's not expensive anymore. Also, Dredd is currently streaming on Netflix.<br />Enjoy.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|I'm a fan of hidden object games, but I didn't enjoy this game much. I'm glad I got it for free, and wouldn't have considered paying for it. There are much better HOG's, such as [[ASIN:B00C2TK3IQ Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart (Full)]] which I previously bought (although unfortunately that stopped working when I upgraded my Nexus 7 to Android 4.3).<br /><br />The game basically works like this: You get a scene with a character, have a pretty long and boring conversation in which they ask you to find stuff in the scene, and then more stuff, and then more stuff, and then some more stuff. Then the chapter ends, and you move to the next one. The conversations are made of flashing lines of text, which pass by at their own speed, and you can skip them, but can't pause them.<br /><br />The game doesn't save except at the end of the chapter, so if you want to stop the battery hungry game at other times, bad luck, you'll have to repeat what you've done.<br /><br />Graphics are decent, although they're designed with a 4:3 aspect ratio, so they look stretched by default but you can turn 'full screen' off and see them letterboxed.<br /><br />Short of it is, I uninstalled it after playing two or three chapters. Still a little better than [[ASIN:B009AY04A8 Pirate Adventures: hidden object game]] I think (though that may be because I got Magic Academy 2 first so wasn't as tired of the format), but pretty bad compared to many other HOG's.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had no idea that this sort of thing actually happened.  My Dad came from Scotland in 1908 and came through Ellis Island.  I am so glad he didn't have to go through this.  I like the comparison of the Orphan Train and today's foster children programs.  It is so surprising how things haven't change as much as they should
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome! I thought it was going to be stupid like all the other free apps biting was totally wrong.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The sample that I read was good, that's why I spent my money on it. Kept reading thinking , it had to get better. Now half way through it, looking at other books. Not worth the time.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was reasonably clean, it had an intresting plot, and I didn't see the end comming. Well worth watching. It was begging for a part two or a TV series tho.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|We loved this movie when it first came out. We could not find it in stores so it was fun to watch it again!
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|So far I like the game, though I've only played through the free trial.  I'm having trouble seeing purchase information for the full game.
630460288X|5.0|I would just like 2 say that i am very happy with this purchase! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition! I have always loved this movie but was only able 2 watch it when it came on tv because i have not found a copy of it anywhere so i am happy 2 have my very own copy now!! :)
020530902X|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't been said already?  This book is the \\"Holy Grail\\" when it comes to establishing a solid and comprehensive foundation for good writing.  My only regret is not having read it while I was in college/grad school.<br /><br />I've burned through this book a few times thus far (an easy task, as it's a quick read), and I can see the results in my writing style.  My only suggestion is that you read it at least twice.  Especially if you're a fast reader by nature.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I really like the show and this book was really good but it wasn't very long. It only lasted me a few hours. But I am definitely going to read the rest of the series
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My 2nd time reading was better than the first!!!  I can't wait to start book 2!!!!  The writing is amazing and keeps me captivated an  yearning for more!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|the game has a very good and addictive gameplay, very good sounds and good graphics, but it is almost a pay for win game.
B00C7L8DM2|2.0|It was good in thought, but not overall. It was way too long and for Aaron ekhart was not a leading man type material. Not for me anyway, no offense to him.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I've never ridden a horse before, but I always thought they were cool, so I downloaded the game, it took a long time to download, so long that I had to count to 100...twice..I really wanted  to play this game and it finally downloaded then took a little bit on loading screen then it got through and I LOVED IT!!! But then, I got out of the game and it wouldn't let me back in! So it was good while it lasted and I'm just gonna say DON'T GET IT!!!! You're probably gonna have to delete it like I did :(

B0090SI3ZW|5.0|We received this movie in great condition and rather quickly from<br />the time we ordered.  While not your usual martial arts movie and while<br />the story line is a little &#34;thin&#34; in spots- it is nonetheless an entertaining movie<br />with a solid cast.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this short novel, told in recollection of a seven year old's experience with the supernatural world.  Although it draws some similarity to the flood of young adult books in this genre (ie. Twilight), it was directed at a more mature reader base.  .
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter could not have gotten to know Ben Franklin or Albert Einstein the way he did Steve Jobs. Or have talked to their friends and associates the way he did Steve's. And as much as we can learn about the times of our forefathers and Einsteins decades, Jobs lived in our times. This book reveals everything imaginable about Jobs plus much about so many interesting people, events, and developments in our own recent past.<br /><br />It helped enormously that Jobs wanted this book to be written by this author.
B00B2OSZIW|5.0|This grip completely changes the feel of the X-E1 in your hand, and I leave it on the camera all the time. It adds enough depth to the side of the camera that your grip is just that much more secure. I often carry the camera with just a wrist strap and the grip makes carrying the camera in that fashion much easier. It also balances the camera nicely, especially when using the 55-200 lens. As others have pointed out, the grip does cover the battery/card door, but it comes off and goes back on in seconds and is not really an issue. Finally, I use the grip together with a Lensmate thumb rest, and the two together improve the handling of the X-E1 immeasurably. So, although it might be a bit expensive, it improves the handling of the camera enough that I do not regret having bought it, even at the price.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I inexplicably owned the Vista for two years before buying this and I regret waiting for so long. It fits, it folds, it keeps drinks upright and it hides my keys & phone from my toddler. Awesome. I also like the inner zipped pouch to stash parking structure tickets.<br /><br />I read that there was some concern that the actual cup holders are soft and don't provide enough support, but I've found that those cardboard sleeves from any coffee shop hold the cup holder up (and open) quite nicely.<br /><br />One thing to know if you're using this with the Vista, if you don't extend the handle then the Diono Buddy will get in the way when you recline the seat (when the seat is in the forward facing direction). Since my husband and I are both tall, we extend the handle so it's never been an issue for us.

1451639155|5.0|LMB is a fan of Georgette Heyer, as am I. Her \\"A Civil Contract\\" was also in this genre.  I read this book first as an eBook, and I enjoyed it.  I ordered it this really nice, big paper version so my shelf would be complete.  It arrived, I got dressed for the gym and sat down to read for a few minutes.  Just the good part.  Six hours later I had read most of the book again(skimmed one short section).  I was left with the same feeling of effervescence as after reading Heyer's \\"Venetia\\" or \\"Cotillion\\".  The plot is actually very like Cotillion, with Ivan and Tej making a nice, sexually active Freddy and Kit.  Like the best Heyer, both halves of the couple have agency.<br /><br />Simon Illyan is back, along with Lady Alys.  Mile and Ekaterine make a short appearance.  So do Duv and Delia.  Other's are mentioned.  This book takes place before Cryoburn.

The album which is an nice and balanced blend of R&B and electronica. The album as a nice textured atmospheric blend to the kind of which you just lay back and take in. The songs are all either downtempo or midtempo but are never boring. The ambient backdrop of the music mesh wonderfully with his silky vocals. Highlights of the album are \\"Pyramids\\", \\"Sierra Leone\\", \\"Bad Religion\\", \\"Sweet Life\\", and \\"Crack Rock\\", with both \\"Crack Rock\\" and \\"Pyramids\\" being m favorites among the bunch.

1400095204|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun is another one of those books that I had been meaning to read for years. I finally had a chance to experience it. What a great book!<br /><br />The novel takes place in mid-late 1960's Nigeria, during the time the Igbo people attempted to become the independent nation of Biafra.  I heard about this civil war, but really did not know much about the horror which resulted.<br /><br />The story is told through the perspectives of (3) main characters (but there are other terrific characters as well). There is Ugwu, a 13 year old house boy for professor Odenigbo who teaches at the university in Nsukka. He is a very observant young boy who notices how well he is treated compared to other house boys.  For example, he sleeps in a bed and is given his own books. He tries his best to do everything right, but sometimes he takes things a bit too far like when he ironed his Mr. O's socks and burned a hole in them. He provides much needed humor at just the right times. Ironically, Odenigbo seems nicer to his house boy than most other people he encounters.<br /><br />Olanna and Kainene are twin sisters who come from a wealthy family. Olanna is the beautiful sister, but lacks confidence. She becomes involved with Professor O and later moves into his home and the two eventually marry. At first Ugwu feels threatened by Olanna'a arrival, but then he becomes devoted to pleasing her.<br /><br />Richard is a shy Englishman, a man who is not comfortable in his own skin. He's always felt inferior whether at home or in Nigeria. Richard has come to Nigeria as a expat to write a book about Igbo art. He becomes involved with Kainene, the twin sister of Olanna. Kainene is not considered to be attractive. She's somewhat aloof, very intelligent and financially savvy, and her relationship with Richard is tumultuous at times.<br /><br />This story covers so many topics: war, genocide, relationships - infidelity, personal identity, loyalty, class struggles and more.  It is a book that would make a great choice for book groups.  It's beautifully written, the characters are fully explored and they are ones that will stick with you.  The author knows how to write, and although this is a work of fiction,  the information about the civil war was very informative. I found the graphic details of the war tough to read about at times, but because the writing had moments of humor and the characters were so interesting, it helped to take my mind off the horrors of war.

0061726834|5.0|I love this book, I have read quite a few utopian/dystopia stories and this is one of my new favorites! Lauren Oliver makes you connect with the charters and relate to a situation that you would never really experience. The Idea of Love as a disease I found interesting, why that? But Oliver presents both sides of the coin quite well. Tho some people may say the ending of the series is unsatisfying I agreed with that for all of .5 seconds until i processed it and then realized how much I loved it! The ending is what sets it apart from other stories of its kind.

B005PK57IK|4.0|Some of the best TV writing and acting, especially for a non-cable TV show.  Season 3 continues to weave a richly textured drama. I love that the show presumes you are smart enough to follow the narrative and doesn't spoon feed you along the way. I feel like I'm being treated like an intelligent adult. The court cases continue to be culturally and politically relevant. The personal dramas ebb and flow and just when you think maybe it's getting a bit too melodramatic, they move on. I'm really impressed that this show has made it into the third season and maintained its quality. Many shows really nose dive in Season 3.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|I had heard all the buzz about Downton Abbey and decided to check it out for myself. Of course, I had to begin with the first episode of season 1 and watch every episode.  By the time I  reached the end of episode 3 of the first season, I was definitely hooked! Each season bought new depth to old characters, added some new ones and took some favorite ones, just like real life. I have enjoyed the series immensely and can't wait for season 4 to air in January!

B00EFYGX5S|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1CEG1Y6QV8MM7]]This adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's popular jungle-themed tome keeps it all light and ditches anything deeper than superficial. One would expect this to have a detrimental effect but it all works in the movie's favor. It's basically a string of sketches and set pieces cobbled around a loose narrative, though it flies by quickly, especially when Baloo is on the screen.<br /><br />Mowgli is a man-cub abandoned in the jungles of India and raised by wolves when Bagheera, a concerned panther, steps in and rescues him. Around 10 years later Bagheera tries to take him back to the man village but they are sidetracked by a variety of animals including Kaa, the snake, and lovable, floppy-armed King Louie, an orangutan who wants the secret of fire.<br /><br />Much of the movie has a late-60s jazz theme which keeps it moving and jiving. The jungle animation, making great use of multi-plane cameras, is absolutely gorgeous, and makes every scene a joy to look at, even during some of the lulls (anything with the Elephants).<br /><br />It's easy to see why it has become a classic as the characters are brilliant. Baloo and Co. came back in TaleSpin 23 years later and secured their status among the most popular Disney characters.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks absolutely gor-gee-ous in 1.75:1 1080p. You won't believe your eyes at how bright and colorful this 46-year-old animation looks. It's flawless. The sound is in very good DTS HD-MA 7.1 with lots of spacious effects and surrounds. Extras are fair, but hardly extensive.
B001152TL6|2.0|When ultra-weird guru David Lynch had a winner, it was special and often almost transcendental (Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet). But sometimes he had mediocre fare. We are pulled slowly (slowly, yes: that was expected, as Lynch likes to takes his sweet time) into the world of Fred and Renee, a boring and quiet couple of characters who seem pulled out of Lynch's childhood of going to the Saturday matinee to see \\"Double Indemnity\\" and \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\". They soon learn that someone has been videotaping them while they sleep, and has been leaving the VHS on their doorstep. What follows this first curiosity is standard Lynchian touches and mood (glaring little end-table lamps, red curtains, shapeshifting, lingering close-ups of frosted pink lipstick, silence interrupted by loud telephone ringing, duality, mayhem, women being humiliated, Jack Nance, et cetera), but it's all not half as interesting or fun as some of his other films, even the wacky lovers-on-the-run-from-the-wicked-witch \\"Wild at Heart\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lost Highway\\" is not a high quality entry in the nightmare world of Mr. Lynch. It didn't work for me. It has glimpses of interesting things, but that's not enough. Now, I did enjoy Bill Pullman here because he seemed unlike himself-- distant, cool, almost sullen. And Robert Blake is highly memorable in a supporting role because of his stark makeup (white face and crimson lips), creepy-as-heck grin, and unsettling persona. It was as if someone put a grownup Eddie Munster and the Chesire Cat into a blender.

1451626096|2.0|I love Philippa Gregory. I love the Cousin's War series: The White Queen, The Lady of the Rivers, and The Red Queen are so strong and compelling that I couldn't wait to read The White Princess (the conclusion of the series.)<br /> But - I was disappointed by TWP. While reading the other three books in the series, I was eager to get back into the story on my lunch breaks and before bed. I didn't necessarily feel this way with TWP.<br /><br />My main gripe with this novel is that as a stand alone, it's weak. Compared to the rest of the series, it does not match up. What makes it weak? Repetition. Repetition. Repetition. I just felt like the same descriptions, lines of dialogue, and character arc (ish?? Do the characters ever really change?) just repeated and stalled. What also makes this novel different to the others in the series is that Elizabeth of York is not as strong of a protagonist as Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, or Jacquetta Woodville. Rather than making things happen like the latter three, Elizabeth of York lets things happen to her. Now, I completely understand the historical context - as a woman, she only had so much power and Gregory had to work within set out historical facts. That being said, this is historical fiction. Gregory often points out that her work is fiction and that people should not take it as fact. So if it's historical fiction, make Elizabeth of York more fiery or defiant or even proactive - all within the confines of historical fact (i.e. conversations behind closed doors, not recorded by history.)<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that Elizabeth of York apparently \\"grows to love' Henry VII - a man who, as Gregory has fictionalized, raped Elizabeth while they were betrothed. A man who was her family's enemy. A man who is cold and suspicious of her throughout the entire novel. I found myself getting so fed up of Henry's constant accusations of Elizabeth, and whether that was on purpose to make the reader feel how Elizabeth felt, I don't know. But it was off putting.<br /><br />There were parts that I enjoyed. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book was when \\"the boy\\" and Katherine Huntly come to court - but that happens in the last third! And then the book just kind of ends abruptly.<br /><br />I won't tell anyone to avoid this book because I believe everyone has different tastes. But from a prose and structure point of view - Philippa Gregory has proved she can do better. Maybe there were pressures from her publishing house to complete a new book in a smaller time frame. Even the cover image doesn't seem up to par with the others. Because I know Gregory can do better, I'm going to chalk TWP up to the money-hungry/business end of all this.elt, I don't know. But it was off putting.<br /><br />There were parts that I enjoyed. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book was when \\"the boy\\" and Katherine Huntly come to court - but that happens in the last third! And then the book just kind of ends abruptly.<br /><br />I won't tell anyone to avoid this book because I believe everyone has different tastes.

B005ISZRES|5.0|For someone who had only ever watched 2 different movie versions of this book I thought it was a great read! Made me realise the movies covered most chapters fairly well. For a free book I would 100% recommend it!
1476733953|5.0|After you get past the beginning when the author is killing everyone off this book is really great. Could not put it down the whole second half.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wow... Must read!!! It only confirms what I knew was out there. There is so much of this world that can't be explained, this book gives meaning!!!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|It has a different format for each level.  Always a new adventure.  Would like to be able to get boost from points, and not have to pay cash for them.  I know that is how it is done, but I don't care for it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It is hard to explain what I liked and didn't like about this book without giving away details about the story.  But it is a different point of view than usually written about.  A good read
1439156816|5.0|Stephen King is an excellent writer who understands the blood and guts of the writing process. He shares what he knows about how to transform terrible first drafts into well-wrought, vital pieces of writing.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|I have played the game for a few days now. Overall the game is enjoyable. But as you progress through the campaign, your health increases do not keep up with the game opponents. it makes it so you have to buy items in the store to match your opponent. If that part of the game were fixed I would up the rating to 4 stars.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was very pleased with this adapter. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a very good and priced right adapter
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love the game. I have a great TEAM that I &lt;3 am extremely fond of, they accepted me and are the GREATEST because I am deaf!! I would like to give the game altogether 5 stars, but it freezes and do NOT always get back the credits and/or the extras that I LOST when the game froze. It IS a GREAT game though, and addicting, also a good way to meet and talk with people around the world, especially when you might be DEAF like me-KIKI
B000HL2J0G|4.0|It's frequently overacted and the plots are not realistic.  But it is generally fun and I wouldn't worry about older kids watching it.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I love this CD, I really enjoy hearing Marc sing, he gives his all and then some, I go to all his concerts when he performs in NY, he is a fantastic perform he gives himself to his audience, I highly recommend, I have his whole collection , - Vivir Mi Vida-  Voy a reír, voy a bailar,  vivir mi vida la la la la , voy a reír, voy a gozar vivir mi vida la la la la
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After 55 years of reading science fiction I've read some great books. This series ranks near the top, on par with Orson Scott Card's Ender series. The premise is believable and the plot is frightening in that its not so far fetched. The main characters are reasonably developed and the plot has several threads. This is one new author I'll be following closely!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book I prefer this over tons of books my family loves it and we will just laugh the whole time
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Something about this game... I really do lose track of time playing it, I don't know how many times I have said &#34;One more run, then I'm done&#34; and its an hour later.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Lots of fun to read and the history is great.  I enjoyed the character and the story quite a bit
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is challenging and makes you think . It is  a different kind of word game. Oh and did I say that also fun.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|This is by far the best!  What I like most about this (other than the return of Michelle Rodriguez) is the character development.  I didn't feel that attached to the characters in this series until the fifth movie.  Now that I care about the characters, the movies are much more engaging.  I hope they continue with great action while continuing to show us the human side of the gang.
067144901X|5.0|If you're new to Boynton's fan club or you haven't discovered her yet it's time to get in the groove.  S.B. is my FAVORITE writer for infants and toddlers.  Her books have incredible rhythms and are so funny.  I LOVE it when you're reading a book to a tiny, tiny person and they laugh at the same things you do.  Somehow she manages to find things that are humorous for a 2-year-old as well as a 32-year-old.  Pure genius!  These are my favorite books to give to new moms and my grandkids will one day have them ALL.  We love our Sandra!  Where to go from here?  We suggest Mo Willems,
B00EEDJHXA|4.0|Lots of the boards on the first few levels are super easy and definitely geared towards the younger player, however as you go along the boards do get together and require much more thought. This game is a great way to test/exercise your ability to think ahead. I would definitely recommend it...Well worth the nominal price.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Classic film. One of my favorite growing up. Bought it on blue ray for better quality. My kids love it too.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Amazing Series!!! I could watch this over and over! Good gift idea also. I plan on buying every season package.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Didn't find it compelling but it was interesting.  Very Interesting character development with an intertwining plot.  Not one of those can't put it down books.
B006885FZI|2.0|Not even close to the quality of Band of brothers. I watched the first 3 Episodes and decided to save my money. What a shame
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I liked the Actor but not particularly the role that DeCaprio played.  I've seen him in other movies  that were so much better.  Thge other actors were mostly new too me.  Storyline was ok but nothing spectacular.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive! It's not as difficult as many escape games but hard enough to keep you interested. Love it!
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I remember seeing great reviews for this when it came out. This is a very similar feeling to Superman. I mean there really never is a good superman movie and yet they keep making them and people keep going to watch them. Every Star Trek movie I go see is if you are honest slow and kinda boring considering the budgets. This is very much like the other ones, after I watched it with my girlfriend I said. \\" that was not very good\\" she also agreed. Matter of fact she caught me nodding off at one point. Sure you probably are going to have to rent this to take a look. It will fade into memory as something you will never want to watch again very overrated just as latest Superman.
B00CSA41FK|4.0|Rear Window on DVD was very good. The original quality of the film was exsenuated when transferred from tape to DVD. The Blu Ray version puts it right in your face because it is so clear and crisp. Meaning<br />;the way the story was done was like watching all the neighbors on a big television screen.
0345803507|2.0|I'm a 'reader' and this trilogy is not even a creditable attempt at lasting literature...there are major gaps in the plot, loose ends, unanswered questions.  All the hype, for what?
B005Z271Y6|3.0|Adele is a fantastic singing talent but not a lady when it comes to her trashy mouth. I would love to play the DVD for friends but I am appalled by her vulgarity between songs.
B006CHML4I|5.0|This band and watch size work all the time.<br />Comfortable at the gym, swimming, shower, work<br />its become my favorite watch - I only take it off for sleeping
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is accurate on what goes in to taking care of a horse and can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|What a fun way to connect all the different fairy tales. He is creative, inventive and beautiful writer. Loved it!
B000JQUGVI|5.0|As you all know (I hope) that this is an English classic & therefore I am at a loss as to how to respond! The reproduction for free for Kindle Fire is therefore excellent value, nothing more to say or add.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|these are 3 really awesome movies, love the set.  they came quicker then I expected.<br />My grandson & I watch them all the time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app works as advertised. It really looks great. I can't wait for more cool options in future updates. Kindle Fire HD.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I got this for my seven year-olds birthday. It blew his mind. He was so excited. He loves Star Wars and Legos. It took us 14 hours to put it together. There were no missing pieces. He loves playing with it.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|-very opinionated writer<br />-makes it sound like his way is the only way to succeed which I do not believe<br />-does make some good points and suggestions<br />-not everyone sees themselves as an idea guy, some of us just want to go to a regular ol' job and get a paycheck and be happy with where we are in life
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loving every page of this wonderful book! It is a definite must for fantasy lovers. Oh yes indeed it is!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I think it might be better to say that people need to overcome shyness more than anything else.<br />Nothing stood out to me as earthshattering information.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|This series of movies are the only ones I really like Tom Cruise in.  I am purchasing the complete set.
B00BXUG0KU|4.0|What is missing is what I need for a CD that is a tribute - liner notes that speak to why a tribute and something about the inspiration - in this case Chet Baker.  I already know much about him, but for someone who just bought this without knowledge of Chet Baker and his life and talent they might be left wondering why a tribute or not even notice.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE, I WISHED THAT I COULD SING ACAPELLA!  I KEEP SINGING ALL OF THESE SONGS IN MY HEAD.
0761171703|5.0|I bought this initially for my grandchild who is a ballerina; she loves dancing and plans a career. I may have to order another copy for her as I am keeping this copy for me.  Amazing photos by a genius photographer with a great idea that is satisfying and inspiring.
6305127646|5.0|I have looked and looked for this movie!  I used to own it 15 years ago and watched it so much I about wore it out!
B009RX85N0|5.0|Nothing to complain about. Satisfied with my purchase. Sealed and in perfect condition. Delivered pretty fast too. Will buy the next season for sure.
1401938906|5.0|I haven't completed all the experiments yet. I already knew the first 3 would work.  I am not new to these concepts in my life.  I am anxious to see new enlightenment with the rest. A great book for introducing skeptics or someone who might not be clear on their expectations and becoming aware of the answers to their prayers/requests. I love Pam's sense of humor. It's an easy read. I'd recommend everyone to give it a try.
B00992CF6W|5.0|words can not describe minecraft every day i check if there is an update and it does not disapoint me so i say get this app get this app get this app get this app
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This is a series that the writers have been able to &#34;keep the entertainment going&#34; and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you like action then this is a must see movie.  It doesn't let you down and it has some good looking men to boot.
B00486070K|3.0|This is a must for anyone with a MacBook Pro w/ Retina.  The product is sufficient for what you need.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I knew virtually nothing about this movie (other than the fact that it was the 2009 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language Film) when I put the DVD on last night, but before long I was absolutely entranced. It's a slice of Japanese life and culture that is by turns funny, cerebral, and very, VERY touching. One of the best films I've seen this year. On the other hand, if your movie tastes veer more toward Michael Bay films and mindless Adam Sandler/Kevin James comedies, this may not be your cup of tea. It DOES require an attention span. But if it makes a difference, the dialogue is not rapid-fire, and anyone with average reading skills with have no problem keeping up with the subtitles.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Have read many of his books and enjoy his work, not sure I would order in an Ebook version again
B007TXN4TK|1.0|YAWN.  Not what I had expected the program to be.  Not my cup of tea.  Its free so no harm done.
0307887448|5.0|I actually bought this one on Audible. But then I liked it so much that I bought it for my brother-in-law in paperback! I thought it was well-written, and my brother-in-law and other friends have had a good time nerding out about it.<br />The audible version is narrated by Wil Wheaton, an excellent choice!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Play over and over until I master a level.  Many levels to conquer each more challenging than the previous level.
0312641893|4.0|Oh, Cinder how you've stolen my heart. I picked up Cinder by chance. I was browsing my local B&N, wanting to buy some new YA books and I saw an end cap featuring the Lunar Chronicles. I had seen good things about the series and decided to give it a chance. It was well worth the risk.<br /><br />I started reading Cinder without checking out synopsis and it's probably a good thing that I did. I'm not one to read books with cyborgs, and in most cases aliens, so I would never have given Cinder a chance. I would have would have been the loser in that scenario because I would have missed out on a great book. So you know the saying \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover,\\" well I think that also apply to genre. If I would have turned the book over and saw the genre I would have put it back on the shelf. Maybe I'm the only one who is a genre snob but I've learned my lesson. I should all books a chance.<br /><br />Cinder has it all. There are cyborgs, androids, a prince, aliens, plagues, \\"evil\\" stepmother, and annoying step-sisters. You might be thinking, \\"Wow, there's a lot going on,\\" and there is. But somehow Marissa Meyer's was able to weave all these things into a seamless story. I never felt overwhelmed everything that was happening, and the pace was spot on. One scene flowed into the next, and I was never ever bored.<br /><br />I was in love with the epic cuteness that is Cinder and Prince Kai's relationship. There is such an innocence to both characters, though both of them have been through so much. I couldn't help by root for them and their relationship from the beginning. They don't have a ton of scenes together, because Cinder is about so much more than their relationship, but every time they were together I couldn't help the silly grin on my face.<br /><br />Cinder ends with so many questions left unanswered, and I can't wait to read Scarlet. I think everybody needs to give this book a chance. The writing is superb and plot is insanely good. It's one of the best books I've read this year.I've read this year.
0156027321|5.0|This is a great read!!  I saw the movie first and loved it.  Which is better? Tough to say.  This book will hold your interest, make you laugh, and put you in the lifeboat with Richard Parker.  I read a lot of books and write reviews about very few.  Highly recommend this book for all ages above 13.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This guy just chugs away. It is small for a men's watch but it has a clean face and nice weight on the wrist. I use it daily in the clinic and the red seconds hand it helpful. Also for a stock band, it's very comfortable and seemingly durable as well. For the price, this watch is a steal.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I love this series and will watch it again!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has a gift for storytelling and for building characters in such a way that they are slowly revealed with great art. I loved this book and would recommend it to all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so ready for Season 4! I love the mix of characters and seeing how everything comes together and then falls apart somewhere else only to come together again!
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Independence Day is a movie where you need to suspend your belief a bit, but it has many moments of humor and good<br />action scenes.  The actors are more than competent--I particularly liked the interplay between Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best of all my bingo games. Very fun to play and the slots are good too.  Easy to use a lot of bonus.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I had been looking this complete set from many other retailers and found the price to be off putting.  I liked the show, but wasnt willing to spend 300 dollars for the set.  I was able to get the entire series, used, for around 125.00 through Amazon.  It arrived quickly and was in the exact condition listed.  It even came with an edition of the town newspaper!  Super excited to delve back into one of my favorite shows as a teenager.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I had read this in high school and it was nice to re-visit this classic. I took advantage of the free book of the month whispersync with audible for this and was able to go back and forth between listening and reading this classic with ease.
0880794968|5.0|I love the bright colors in this deck, they're really vibrant.  I like the feel of these cards and the design on the backs of them too.  I recommend them.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I love this movie, Very down to earth and entertaining, It is very definitely on my re-watch list, some parts make you want to laugh, some cry, and some cheer.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|I love this book.  I would use this to teach personification to fifth and sixth graders. It is adorable ,creative and imaginative. The author captures the crayons with words and pictures.<br />Great BOOK.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was one of those books I couldn't put down!  VERY good!  Lots of different people with different things going on in their lives, but still all connected.  It was GREAT!!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My granddaughter seems to enjoy playing it.  She's 4<br />I'm just getting use to my kindle fire, so maybe down the road I'll get to download more fun things.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was the greatest director who ever lived, and this is one of the best of his early, British period. So many of the things that would come to define his films began here: the wrong man; the icy blonde; the perfect balance between heart-pounding suspense and witty, risque dialog. Robert Donat as Richard Hannay is one of the best Hitch heroes ever.<br /><br />Word of advice: go for the Criterion edition of this one, as all other copies I've seen are terribly low quality in terms of audio and picture.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME it's pretty addicting but ohmgeee so worth it I play it everyday cause I'm a lover of tennis :)
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|It is a well made movie.  People who love literature will love this movie for sure.  I watch it 2 times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is deffinetly worth it the only thing I don't like is it doesn't have all the stuff it has on xbox
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A powerful book about life and death, and how we try to muddle through the world, and make sense if it all. Poignant, thoughtful, and brilliant.
B00000K3D4|5.0|this in my opinion is one of the best movie to come out of the 80s. It was good then and still holds up today.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Yes, there have been plenty of albums bearing the name Black Sabbath since the breakup of the original crew but to me they just didn't count. While I very slightly disappointed that the lyrics and themes of the songs are not in my opinion the bands best work it is still an all around solid offering for a band that hasn't put an album out in a long time. I am hoping they release some more material. I would love to see what direction they go in next. Any true Sabbath fan should definitely get this album!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The price is decent compared to the stores. No scratches, damages, anything. We are huge SOA fans and decided we should buy all the seasons so that well we can watch them whenever!
0670020745|5.0|This book was in excellent condition when I received it.  Brand new in appearance.  Have not yet read it, but anxious to start.
B00CBR9S44|4.0|There are different cuts of this film, and some are much less sensible than others. The \\"international release\\" in particular has been severely cut so that some characters just appear out of nowhere. Reviews of one version may simply not make sense for a different version.<br /><br />Which version is this? (how long is it?)<br /><br />(Wikipedia says: \\"There are three versions of the film that has been released. First is the domestic \\"Chinese Cut\\" of the film that runs 130 minutes. Second is the version of the film that debuted at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival at 123 minutes. The third is the version released by The Weinstein Company that runs at 108 minutes.\\" Note NTSC&lt;->PAL conversions _may_ produce running times that differ by a handful of minutes; even so running times would make it clear which version/cut a disc contains.)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|OK OH MY ILL COLLECT YOU AT 6 PM MY SUBCONSOIUS SNARLED AT THE MIRROR OMG I HATE THIS BOOO;K SO MUCH IT RAISES MY BLOOD PRESURE ITS SO BAD IM MAD
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Believable characters, excellent plot development, great acting and it completely takes you into their world. I thoroughly recommend this series.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very well done and easy to learn...you can build a descent city in a matter of time. I just love it!
145162607X|5.0|Ever since the Tudor series - I'm hooked - and I daresay the Cousins War series is even better!  That's probably because none of these books seem to be &#34;filler&#34;.  Some of the Tudor series seemed to be stretching it a bit.  All of them were great and interesting, don't get me wrong, but some could get a bit redundant (obviously telling the stories from different angles - but maybe I'm trying to say predictable).  The Kingmaker's Daughter breathes fresh life into the books about Jacquetta's line - and has a lot of twists and turns!  Very good :)
044654146X|5.0|this book kept me up all night.. it is great  buy it you will love it<br />eye opening  defiantly a start-up
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|The characters are further developed and the series gets smarter. Fast- paced and full of interesting plots.  I'll keep watching
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is a superior adaptation of Emma! The actors, acting, costumes, design, directing are all wonderful! --really enjoyed it & would highly recommend it.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|Yesterday, I did 7 miles on my treadmill desk. The Withings only detected 300 steps. It just doesn't work. It only detects a very small fraction of your activity. Save your money.
B00DGL3ILI|5.0|I ordered this on vinyl from the UK, and got the black 180 gram version, which is more than fine. Also included was a poster and a catalog insert of other Nuclear Blast releases, and what format they are available in. Also be on the lookout for Testament's live effort \\"Dark Roots of Thrash\\" that is soon to be available on vinyl.<br /><br />The show was phenomenal at the Avalon in LA in November 2012. By the time they made it to Germany where this is captured, they were beyond tight. The sound is superior to anything Rush has done on a live recording since the late 80s to put this recording in context. The sound is clear, heavy, and the crowd is present too, in a good way. The chanted chorus of the opening track \\"Phantom Antichrist\\" gave me a flashback. The other tracks ring out, you hear everything extremely well: Ventor's drums and cymbals shine, Sammi's guitar leads penetrate, and Mille's voice and solos also stand clear in the mix. I am mulling the DVD now after hearing this.<br /><br />I am a big fan of metal on vinyl, and this two-disc set is worth the coin, although I obtained it through eBay, you can get it from Amazon too. Frankly, getting it on black vinyl is more than ok, because the whole color vinyl thing is overblown and gimmicky. Besides, black vinyl can be more pure and sound quieter than most colored discs.<br /><br />As live recordings go, this one is fantastic, even if Kreator has done a lot of them since 2000. If you are a fan, it is a must!
0810970686|5.0|I previously purchased these books and some movies for my granddaughter now almost eleven.  When my son told me his son who is six was reading one of them I wanted to get the set for him.  Amazon is one of the best ways to do this without throwing money away.  So far, I have never had a problem with any order(well over 100).
B0052UZIFA|3.0|My grandson and I both love this game BUT it often closes, or does not load at all. We play on my Toshiba Thrive tablet. I have had problems with other PopCap games. All other games play great on my tablet  please fix these problems and rating will change to 5 stars.
B00E3D7WGU|4.0|I really don't understand all the complaints revolving around the two disc version. I saw this show twice. The first Yankee Stadium show in New York and in Cleveland. There is nothing wrong with the audio. However, this is not the same as say the Sticky and Sweet tour DVD/CD combo pack. Why she chose to market the MDNA combo pack overseas and not here, is beyond me. But as it is, the CD is fine.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 6 yr old grandson plays this on his dad's iPad . I'm so glad it came out on android. He loves this game! He plays his own make-believe adventures on the different playgrounds. He can spell most of the items he needs, and very willingly types out the ones he ask me to spell-like helicopter. Really builds reading spelling and typing abilities while his imagination runs wild! Nice to have a game he scripts himself, rather than just following something prepackaged! Plays well on Toshiba thrive.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I bought this for a gift and they loved it! It was delivered fast too and as always amazon is my favorite place to shop!
0425263908|5.0|I can not put down this book. I just ordered the next 2 so i will have them. I cant wait to read them next. Very great BOOK.
B00C061I1M|5.0|Music so original, creative, and poetic and a voice so  unique and beautiful --<br />I hope to get more music by Valerie June
B0053TWVDC|5.0|on time and in good work good and i will like more to see like that think you very much
B00CH26TL8|5.0|The game is fun and amusing and keeps me occupied. Sometimes it's frustrating when the ball on the kettle is same color about 3 or 4 times in a row. I would like to know how many balls are left and what color.
1401223176|5.0|This graphic novel is phenomenal. It gives you so many of Batman's classic characters in one sitting. All in a huge plot that leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />The great thing about the plot and pieces, is that they give a breif synopsis of each villain. While you won't walk away with a huge knowledge of Killer Croc, or Harley Quinn, you at least have a general idea and don't feel so lost if you are new to the Batman comics/graphic novels!<br /><br />Definitely a great item to pick up for any Batman fan or someone who is interested in more Batman mythology.
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|This was a perfect upgrade from a E6850 which served very well for a long time.  Though the system still ran games well enough, I started to notice bottlenecking from the CPU as I had a HD6950, which was more then enough for games like Starcraft2 (known to put a heavy load on the CPU).  Decided to go with the latest socket an I am glad I did.  Very happy with the overall performance and stability.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I like all the quell games.  I like quell memento the best.  I enjoy games that challenge my brain and this one does.
8866135887|1.0|Be very sure that this is the product that you want.  I purchased it and when it arrived, it wasn't the format that I thought it was.  So I returned it.  The seller charged an $8.95 RESTOCKING fee - which I do not see listed anywhere on this page.  An $8.95 restocking fee for a small planner is ridiculous.  After the fee, and what I paid for shipping, it wasn't even worth it.  They also deducted the cost of shipping.<br /><br />Moleskine products are great and I really like them but I am disappointed with this seller.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|good story, although as you would imagine it is based on your faith. You can't have positive proof (yet) on a story like this, so its not fair to put it down due to no concrete proof. It truly is a book based on individual faith. A good read.
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|Don't really remember it and don't really care.  Didn't care about the characters and the premise was unconvincing.  I do like mindless action films but come on now!
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is easier in a way due to the fact that you dont have to alternate colors or suits to stack up cards, and the A-K goes away when you complete a run. other games you have to pile up A-K in a certain spot while organizing the rest. i like how you can undo a move to get the best one available, makes the game go smoother..
B006ZZAMWK|3.0|Got this for my sons birthday.  Kids love it but after listening to What Makes You Beautiful for the 20th time I want to toss it.  Thanks to the inventor of earphones. Wish some of the lyrics were not encouraging teen hormones but I guess I listened to the Who when I was at that age and did okay.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|This is not a deep book.  It is just plain entertaining with moments of laugh out loud.  It is especially funny if you are from or know people from New Jersey.
B00942S4OY|3.0|Got this for my sons birthday.  Kids love it but after listening to Live While We're Young for the 20th time I want to toss it.  Thanks to the inventor of earphones.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|An intriging and suspenceful story of  parents management of, and defense of a murder allegedly committed by their young son.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book isn't your typical romance novel it's that and so much more. A very intense read that grasps your attention from start to finish.
B00BDRJ3Z2|3.0|I'd say 75% of the tracks are excellent with the rest rating just OK.  Obviously there's a common theme but as a collection of previously released songs, it does lack the cohesiveness you typically get out of a traditional album.  For $5 it was well worth adding to the collection if you're a Luke Bryan fan or just want to add a few summer/beach songs that span youthful frivolity and fondly remembered melancholy.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's cheap. It's fun. It has 14 tracks so if you're even considering it, just buy it already and enjoy.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Is very informative and helpful. Helps to get a feel for places you may want to frequent. The app doesn't give all the options that are available on the full site.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Very easy to see the story as you read it. That's the only way to read and enjoy a book
B00007K02F|5.0|I've watched this movie several times since I purchased it.  Love it.  Of all of the Jane Eyre movies I've seen this one was the best.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Reading this made me want to go out there and create my own marketing campaigns using the SUCCESS framework the Heath brothers developed.
B00594XOZU|4.0|My children use this and my concern is if adults can easily pretend to be kids. I'm not sure how safe it is (parents know who your kids are talking to).
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic book. One of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. Invokes the Isaac Asimov style of thought provoking storytelling.
B00A285OOW|4.0|The book kept my interest but felt redundant and too long at times. On the whole, I'd recommend the book.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Simply put this is the best western made. Epic story, beautiful country, and the most haunting music. True cinema masterpiece.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was not hooked after watching the first season and someone told me to watch Season 2 & 3 because they are better. She was right. This season had lots of plot twists and they were all very interesting.As usual, they ;eave you at the end of the season wanting more.
1863514201|5.0|Very nice book, and the work is beautiful. I Had to get 2, one for me and one for my daughter.
0517548232|5.0|I won't write an in depth review of this book but I just wanted to say how life changing it is and how it is the best thing to wake up collectivists (socialists, communists and fascists) and believers in the merits big government intervention in the economy. Government only ever makes things worse and it's incessant meddling causes huge distortions to markets as well as mis-allocation of resources and asset bubbles.<br /><br />For years I would hear politicians and economists say things that I knew intuitively to be wrong but I always thought \\"Well I must be wrong and they must be right because they are experts and they know what they are talking about.\\" This book showed me that I was not wrong- that I was correct to doubt much of the nonsense spouted by politicians and I learned a lot of new things along the way.<br /><br />This book helps to dismantle many economic fallacies and helps you to see through the rubbish that pours out of economically illiterate politicians mouths on a daily basis. If every school going youth was made to read this book as part of their educational process, the world would be a much better, freer and more prosperous place and there would be much greater opposition to the growth of big government. People would (correctly) stop looking to governments and politicians for solutions and start viewing them more as the problem.<br /><br />A brilliant book and probably one of the most important I have ever read.
B006GOT5OG|1.0|Was to not even close to wht I and my daughter thought its just tiny kitty like a key chain<br />totally off my thought
0385523394|5.0|I don't have premium cable channels & love to read. I have read many reviews of TV series & book differs so don't compare 100%.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I don't usually read non-fiction but this book was one of the books that was suggested reading for a book club which I am a member of.  I liked it - the author gave the reader a lof of insight into what it is like to be involved in the criminal justice system.  To those of us who know nothing about it, I felt like I learned a lot.<br /><br />The book was well-written and moving and I thought it was a good, and fairly quick, read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Phenomenal show!  Wonderful writing and acting! I am anxiously waiting for season 4 to premiere. A must see for anyone.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was probably my favorite book of 2013 (so far) and I read a lot.  But what a tearjerker!  I think I cried through the last 20% or so of the book.<br /><br />Moving and wonderful, this was well-written and a great story.  You really care about the characters and what happens to them.<br /><br />I read another book by JoJo Moyes after this that wasn't nearly as good so I am glad that I read this one first.<br /><br />Terrific, I highly recommend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Keeps you on your toes. Leaves you holding on to see what happens next. Great read for any time. Enjoy
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Keeps you interested throughout the movie. All characters have their own agenda initially but they rise to the occasion giving the movie a perfect climax.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered my Chromecast on 28 July, and finally received it this past Tuesday (10 September). Patience is a virtue here!<br /><br />With the iOS app on both my iPhone and iPad mini, it was a breeze to setup. The app does let you reset the Chromecast to factory defaults, rename it, change the time zone, as well as reboot it.<br /><br />The Google Cast extension does work in both Windows and Linux. However, tab casting is only working in Windows. I have yet to get Screen casting to work from my notebook. I suspect my notebook isn't powerful enough to do screen casting.<br /><br />It does take it a bit to start streaming YouTube and NetFlix. I've only had NetFlix crash on the Chromecast once.<br /><br />My Insignia TV, a NS-32E440A13, supports CEC, but only has HDMI 1.2. So, I have to use the USB AC adapter or the TV's USB port.<br /><br />To get CEC to work, one has to use the wall adapter. My TV has options to power on, switch inputs. While Chromecast can turn on my TV, it doesn't always switch to the correct input. It's like Chromecast is going to sleep or low-power mode.<br /><br />I also have a 3rd generation Apple TV. These two devices have different purposes and functionalities. So, one can't really make fair comparisons between the two.<br /><br />Just a matter of time before more apps are released upon finalization of the SDK.<br /><br />Even with these few bugs, it's well worth the $35.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|'Star Trek: Into Dumbness'<br /><br />Join vastly overrated director J.J. Abrams and comically inept writers Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelof (seriously, will these guys take a break from ruining the Sci-Fi genre?) as they take one final stab at perverting the Star Trek brand before moving on to other, inevitably poorly done, Sci-Fi projects.<br /><br />Watch as familiar characters are fleshed out...well, not at all, instead relying on throwing an occasional curveball at preconceived notions so that no more than the bare minimum of time is used to develop them.<br /><br />Put aside your disbelief as transporter technology in the future will work solely as a lazy plot device, operating only as a means to set up the next silly action sequence. Suspend any knowledge of physics as well as your common sense for such scenes as: spaceship underwater, spaceship pulled out of orbit within seconds, characters foregoing use of shuttlecraft to approach disabled ship...and many...many...crushingly, many more. Most of all prepare yourself for the most stupidly unbelievable things of all, the characters motivations.<br /><br />A movie that doesn't fail (and fail badly) because  for being a reboot or even for being unoriginal...it's a movie that fails because it's so jaw droppingly filled with terrible plotting and hollow action.
030746363X|5.0|I dropped 20 pounds of fat with a diet that I could sustain for a lifetime if I wanted to. I'm now in the process of bulking up, and just added on 10 pounds of muscle. If you're interested in taking control of your body, Get This Book!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin focuses on the personal relationships and conflicts of Lincoln's cabinet, which makes for an engaging  read. It is a hagiography for President Lincoln, but well deserved. His death is an American tragedy of awesome magnitude. The great man theory may be absurdly reductionist, but I think Lincoln would say we need heroes (and stories!) and he is mine.
0547884591|5.0|Cooking for anyone, especially those that utterly failed in the past. I can't believe I'm in love with cooking, and actually picked my newest place based on the size of the kitchen. No one knows who I am anymore! This book is amazing. Buy It. Now.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|A very enlightening book to those becoming consciously aware and who want to remove the ego. Eckhart is always on it.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I loved it...could not stop watching it. Every teenager should watch it to get a big picture of themselves. Maybe some would change their path.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Bought after JJ Cale passed away since I didn't have any of his music in my collection. Eric Clapton always sounds good and I enjoy the collaboration very much.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I gotta hand it to Urban.  He was pretty good, but Dredd is cold and emotion less anyway.  Great movie.
B002GMSMHS|4.0|It was the correct memory card for my Olympus Stylus-7000 Camera. I wanted extra memory for my camera although the original card still works fine. Wish my camera used SD Micro cards, But I'm used to the Stylus-7000.
B00EN8OAGU|1.0|I managed to finish this book but it was a struggle. Poorly written - profanity that added nothing to the storyline. She used a lot of &#34;big&#34; words, perhaps trying to impress me. She failed. I thought the story was disgusting.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's an okay game. It gets a little bit repetitive after a while, looking for the same block of cheese and high heeled shoe over and over again.
B0016HMYEQ|3.0|If you don't like a lot of movement in a movie, meaning the camera shaking all the time, then not for you.  Supposedly they documented the movie with a personal video camera that the battery lasted over 7 hours of taping.  Can someone tell me the brand, because I want one.<br /><br />Movie is OK and that's about it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love Alycia. She is awesome. The story is so intriguing, I can't stop watching.<br />That's why it is good to watch on Amazon, you can ultimately finish all the episode<br />At once.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great fun for kids and adults alike. The minions keep you laughing as the boards get more challenging. very addictive
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Excellent read from a very interesting perspective. I will miss the characters! I'd love to see a follow-up at some point.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Woke me up with a smile it's a must have app. Wish it just wished it made coffee. I would recommend it to a friend.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It was a good book! Well worth the time and money that is asked for it! I am ready to read more!

B00CF34B2I|5.0|As a new player to Magic this app goes into great detail on each phase of the game. Good way to find tricks that your friends could try when playing the card game. Highly recommend this app!
B007SSF3O0|5.0|This is a delicious tale that has been brilliantly constructed for our benefit.  The cast is marvelous, each character is crisp and personal, and they play well together.  It may not be Gone With The Wind or the next Academy Award winner, but engaging, lively and it's loads of fun.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Typical Baldacci novel.  Held my attention for most of the book.  I read all of Baldacci's novels - totally enjoying them.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great music. Loved hearing and seeing the artists and reliving the music of my high school years. If you love music, you must see it.
1444777556|5.0|I love reading of the adventures of Bob and James and their very special story.<br /><br />Hope they follow up with a 3rd book soon.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Gorgeous masterful album chock full of incredible sounds as only the magnificent Mr. Wilson can imagine and bring to life. This CD is a must for anyone who likes great music especially in the art/prog rock genre. Every song is exhilarating and brilliant! If you like Genesis, Pink Floyd and King Crimson you will love this album. No matter how many times I listen to &#34;The Raven&#34; I just cannot get enough of it. each listening reveals more and more of the brilliance of Mr. Wilson who is today one of the most talented people in music at least in my humble opinion. All I can do is say &#34;Thank you Mr. Wilson for all of the unbridled joy your majestic music has brought to me&#34;
B0019K06WM|5.0|Well, not really.  Seems like a table with three legs, missing one...but we're talkin' Byrds and Hollies here...3 is great; two is better than none.
B00APYUPB0|5.0|Wow is all I can say about this reissue of the 1983 classic masterpiece by one of Progressive Rock's most talented artists. If you like great music especially in the Prog/Art rock genres then do not hesitate to buy this CD. The booklet is awesome and the quality through and through is top-notch. 5 stars plus!
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u want a great game, this is the one. It is probably the best one I have.<br />I spend tons of time on it each day.<br />  Get this game!
B009AY04A8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game, not the hardest you will find but fun to do. A great way to waste time.
B002ZG980U|3.0|Bought this as a gift for my mom cause she likes this genre of movies and she said it was pretty good. I also watched it and it wasn't bad. Not much else to say about it...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4.  I am considering buying the series.<br />Just didn't like the ending of season 3.  How sad.......
B00AFEY354|4.0|Good story, characters/cast, and totally underrated. Emma Watson is adorable as always &#60;3 Want to see more of her and all the other actors from this film!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Every time I momentarily lose WiFi, TuneIn stops me from running, forcing me to go back to the Amazon App store to log in again instead of simply retrying. I have modern devices that are well set up. It happens on my new Nexus 7 and Galaxy S3. I never have this a problem with apps on Google. They are trying so hard to protect the app that they punishing the paid users.<br /><br />Other than this issue, the app is fantastic, just get it from Google.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|really enjoyed this game. I wish it had been<br />a little longer. over all it was a great game. love all the g5 games
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Watched this movie in high school and 9 years watched it again, I had no idea it was Gerard Bulter hes fantastic and Emmy Rossum is just as fabulous
B009F7ORQW|4.0|This is a great little Barbie car. It's held up well despite a lot of use. My little girl loves it. The only reason why it got 4 stars is because both side mirrors fell off and now they don't stay in so I threw them away. My daughter doesn't mind that it's missing the mirrors, but the small pieces are a choking hazard for her baby sister.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book, far better than the movie! There is a feeling of teen angst similar to many young adult books these days. However, instead of focusing on the ‘mushy stuff’ like so many of these books do, the author moves on and focuses on an actual plot. This has become the leading book that I recommend to folks seeking something from the YA Sci-Fi area.
B0053KWDES|5.0|i received this unit in the mail opened the box, charged it over night and today i have been enjoying my music with higher clarity, deeper bass and louder volume...i had to stop listening for a bit due to ringing in my ears...now i'm listening to it on my computer..versatile...had the fiio 17 dac amp it wasn't portable it had to have an external power supply per usb....not for me and gave it away..
B00DWZHTRW|3.0|I've heard it said of sales that people tend to buy on emotion and later justify their purchase with logic. Well, the fact that it had some good actors and a interesting concept certainly got my emotions. I was excited to see it. But then my logic tried to justify it to no avail. Here are some problems I had. First of all, I immediately noticed that Jesse was playing the same character as he did in The Social Network. You know, a brilliant-minded prick. And is there any different role for Morgan Freeman to play other than an old wise owl? Woody plays the typical role he's played since White Men Can't Jump. Ruffalo was so angry all the time in the film I expected him to turn into the Hulk at any moment. As far as the other characters, I was not familiar with them. The Interpol agent was pretty and...that's pretty much that about her. Now to the concept: We see the stunts and they get explained to us. That about sums up the plot. Then there was this eye of something thing. The whole movie goes to great lengths to show us basically what magic is, but then tries to say magic is real. So basically, though I wanted to get into some cool story that hasn't been done before (at least to my knowledge) I wasn't really invited \\"in\\" (those who watch should know what I mean). One last thing: Where was the production crew during all of this? You can't tell me the Three Horse Men w/One Horse Lady were able to set all the events up by themselves. In the end I am just left with too many illogical holes that can't be filled and can't be ignored to justify my purchase. If I were to wait a while to write this review, I might eventually give it one star but my logic is still fighting my emotions.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|If I didn't have to sleep and work I would have read it in a day. It was excellent  I can't wait to read the next book. Starting that now!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I just got the Chromecast device, setup was easy.  This could have been an amazing device, but it will not allow you to view local files such as pictures and videos, and even though the device is able to handle it, Google purposefully disabled the feature.  Essentially, it is just a youtube and netflix viewer.  I thought it would allow me to share the pictures and video that I have taken on my Galaxy 3 phone.  But, unfortunately, that feature is not allowed, even though the device is capable of doing it.  Third party software providers were banned from enabling that feature.  This could of been a five star item.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I love this movie.  I was born/raised in Georgia...and this is where it was filmed.  True story too.  It is well done.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|I heard &#34;Blame it on the Girls&#34; as background song for a Youtube video. I found Mika, liked the other songs sampled on Amazon and bought the album. Only two songs I don't like very much. Enjoy!
1607066017|5.0|Everyone else has written a lot so not much else to give other than 1) I rate it 5 stars and 2) I rarely give  out 5 stars.. it has to be in the same league as what many would consider the \\"legends\\" of the comic book industry.. Sandman by Gaiman, Preacher/Hellblazer by Garth and Ennis, Swamp Thing/original Watchmen/V for Vendetta/Killing Joke by.. pretty sure those were all Alan Moore could be wrong.. Kingdom Come by DC .. but Saga, definitely 5 stars.<br /><br />Very interesting characters who we see \\"in depth\\" so to speak and interesting plotlines and you have yourself a winner.. I find myself eagerly anticipating each issue as it comes out.. there is a LOT of soap opera in here which to me is what makes it all the more enjoyable.. if you're more a fan of grim \\"wham pow sock em up \\" type superhero fare found in your average comic then this might not be the one for you - don't get me wrong there's violence in Saga too but it's not dripping from multiple panels in the comic (unlike other series) and only emerges when it \\"makes sense for the plot\\" if you understand what I mean.. great, GREAT series , wonderful to see something like this .. after the classics of the 1980's/1990's I mentioned above I was beginning to despair that wonderful comics of that quality would never come our way again but Saga definitely fits the bill..
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I loved this little gadget... how it displayed the time, the weather.. how many alarms I could set up..<br />UNTIL it actually went off one morning when I had my Kindle on.<br /><br />I tried for over five minutes to silence the alarm to no avail.. I looked through settings and through help and I couldn't find one clue how to turn the thing off again. Finally I had to uninstall the program.  It needs a way to turn off the alarm and if there is one that I don't know about, it needs to be covered in help or somewhere in the program!
B001JIFYSA|4.0|Fun to watch, and lots of eye candy for everyone, male and female. Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, for starters!

B001ASLVLI|5.0|A classic, must have for any movie collection.<br />The often repeated line &#34;what we have here is failure to communicate&#34; comes from this movie.
0345803485|2.0|I have heard so much about this book and didn't really know what to expect. I knew there was a bunch of romance but that was not what this book is about. I felt that I was reading something out of an erotic sex book rather than a romance. It did make for an interesting story line but overall I was disappointed in the content. If you enjoy raunchy sex narratives than this is the book for you.  I am shocked at how many women recommended this to me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book along with the other two in the series. I can not wait for the next book. I feel like I have lost two good friends now that I have finished these books.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Very well written and presented, insightful content, great to read, highly recommended as a Kindle read as well. Hope to read mure books from Rhonda nByrne
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. With this being the last one in the series I thought it would've been better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One forgets the gore and its absurdity, and just becomes engaged in the great story and strong characters.  Would highly recommend this series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles were fun and moderatley challenging.  I will be looking forward to more puzzles in the future. Let me out !  :D
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love Walter. Pseudo science is such a fun topic. I wish another show took over to fill in the gap.
B003TML0VO|5.0|This compilation surprised me.  It just works on so many levels.  The vocalists chosen seem to mesh perfectly with each track either conveying what the original vocalist was trying to say (see Chris Cronell on Whole Lotta Love, Rob Thomas on Sunshine of Your Love, or Jacoby Shaddix on Smoke on the Water...), or delivering a fresh perspective on an old familiar song (NaS on Back in Black, or India Arie on While My Guitar Gently Weeps).  Carlos is at his best throughout - complementing, rather than steamrolling over the tracks - it's what he does best.  The talent is just dripping out of this CD.  This, to me, represents a fresh take on some great classics as opposed to just rehashing some tired rock n' rollers.  Hip Hop AC/DC???  Outrageous!!!  Kudos to Carlos Santanna for the bold statement made.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I love this movie. A great thriller and plot. I am looking forward to Insidious 2 this weekend. Thank you.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This version is more challenging to me than others.  It takes more thought and strategy to figure out. It works my brain.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|When I first got this game on my Galaxy smartphone it was great. But now I can't get it due to an app situation. It asks me to sign in but when I do I get the message.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|This game won't work correctly.  Have to hold it at a strange angle just to drive strait.  Uninstalled very quickly.
B005DN7W4G|2.0|While this movie has some interesting points it suffers badly from endless reuse of plot lines from other similar movies. Not only that, it seems to want to give something for everybody -- teenage love, a bit of drama between a grown up daughter and her father, lonely and wise astronaut who saves the world and many more. In the end, every one of these plot lines is just a cliche with zero depth and entirely linear and predictable outcome.
0425267695|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of fantasy fiction. At first, I thought it was good but not ground breaking. Then I finished it. OH MY GOD! Read this book then read it again. Drop whatever your reading now and start Blood Song now. I am totally blown away and psyched to have found an amazing new fantasy author that doesn't feel the need to copy Tolkien every step of the way. Bravo, Mr. Ryan, bravo!!!!
B00932A4XE|4.0|The movie seems to meander quite a bit at first but eventually picks up the action and the plot. It is worth watching till the end.
0060853972|5.0|I have degrees in English Literature and Theology from Manhattan College, so I've read A LOT of books throughout my lifetime, but this one book blows them ALL away!  It's just THAT good!  I'm reading it for a third time right now, and enjoying it just as much now as the first and second times.  Why aren't more books like this written more often?!?!  It is absolutely hysterical, subversive in every wonderful way, and just laugh-out-loud brilliant through and through.  I honestly hate to exaggerate, but I believe reading this book will vastly improve your existence immediately and leave you completely breathless with giddy, unending delight.  You'll close the book and start telling everyone you know they HAVE to read it now too.  And if you're anything like me, you'll buy a few copies for others, just to help them see why you've been laughing so much lately!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the ease and keyboard.  Loads easily,saves previous totals,easy access to keyboard.  Big numbers and no fancy math keys makes it an easy to use calculator.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I love Supernatural, but you could definitely tell there were different writers in the 8th Season.  In the first episodes, the dialogue between Sam and Dean seemed stiff, not peppered with obscure music or horror movie references like it usually is.  HOWEVER, this definitely improved as the season went along, with Sam and Dean seeming more like their normal characters.  I still love it!
B00DXP0QX0|4.0|This is a two CD 2013 Mercury records release. It contains 24 tracks with a total playing time of one hour and forty-one minutes. The compositions are alternate versions and outtakes from the five original albums RS made during his 1969 -74 contract with Mercury records. All the material has been previously released throughout the years in various compilations and box sets.<br /><br /> However, this is the first time all the tracks have appeared within one release. The sound quality is relatively flawless. The twenty-three page booklet contains comprehensive liner notes authored by Scott Schinder. There's also a detailed listing of time, place and musicians associated with each track.<br /><br />This release captures the young artist evolving as a major solo rock / blues /folk performer. During this period, Rod had a duel career, fronting the Faces, as well as pursuing a solo career. Eventually, with the mega seller release of\\" Every Picture Tells a Story\\" and the hit single\\"Maggie May\\", Rod would depart the Faces.<br /><br />Additionally, the session musicians playing on these recordings are all rock legends.<br />Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and Kenny Jones were all Rods' mates from the Faces. Mike Waller was the drummer in Rod's earlier band, Steampacket and he also was a member with RS in the Jeff Beck Group.<br /><br /> Pete Sears played on several studio dates with Rod and he would eventually make his mark with Jefferson Starship. Martin Quittenton, aside from being a guitar virtuoso, also co-wrote \\"Maggie May\\".<br /><br />Last but not least, the legendary Long John Baldry and Madeline Bell on backing vocals is truly a musical pleasure.<br /><br />Fans who appreciate this period of Rod's career will be richly rewarded by rediscovering the songs through alternate versions and outtakes. Some of the tracks are in an embryonic stage with Rod adding and changing lyrics and the musicians altering tempos and arrangements. All this material is worth a listen. The music public is fortunate this material exists and was finally released in one box set.<br /><br />It captures a musical time and place that will never be repeated.
B0036FYO12|5.0|Dated, yes.  But it still holds its own even w/o modern items, clothes, hair, etc. and w/o modern cinematorgraphy.  Very well done.  Only thing that might have improved it, is if when Redford's co-workers were killed, they never showed the opposition doing any of the killing.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|I've been having a great time with this game. Also bought the expansion pack and it makes it even greater. The dice are top quality with crisp images and the game is very easy to learn, even for small children.<br />My only complaint is that the dice container is made of a cheap cardboard. Since it's used as the dice cup, it's getting dirty and weaker with its use.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Love John Mayer and love this album.  He is just too good.  I hope he continues to sing a little country once in a while.  He is good at it but better at the Jazz guitar.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Star treks latest movie into darkness is an entertaining 3D film.<br />Especially the scenes and special effect which are spectacular.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|I have always liked Darius Rucker but this time, I was pleasantly surprised to hear some favorite songs I had been missing plus a few I never knew.  He always has such a good strong voice full of life and energy.  You can't go wrong with this album.  It has some of everything.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The graphics are very easy to view items and the storyline is good. Easy puzzles but as you get further becomes more challenging. Good game for all ages!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Suspensfully, exciting, easy to follow and a wonderful book to add to your Fiction list. I'll probably read it again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I only get free apps 98% of the time and its always handy to have a weather app. This one is perfect. It shows from day to day and also hour by hour forecasts. It's simple which is great for my needs. I would recommend this app to anyone! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandkids wanted it and they play it any time they come over. They seem to never tire of it.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this little bag. Its not to big but not to small. It carries my camera, charger and 2 lenses perfect with a lot of other spots for more storage. Zippers are sturdy and bag is well crafted.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I didn't buy this on purpose nor would I. This must have been a purchased one of my grandkids made before I put a pass word on it. Just can't figure out how to delete the app. I would have allowed my grandkids to download this.

1593272839|5.0|It's a rare thing when you can actually try before buying.<br />This book is online so you can see for yourself if it deserves the money.<br />Very rich, read it several times because you get both the very basic and the very high-end (or I should say high-order) stuff
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Thise was down loaded for my grandkids and they really love it and play it any time they are around.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The old English estate is just like a small town.  This is wonderful drama surrounding the owners, relatives, staff & community!

B00D6SBOWG|5.0|There are a lot of courses to play, even on the free version. If you master them all, you can still go back and play again, without losing the challenge.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|That is a good movie for the kids in the heart. It is fun to watch especially the part at the end.
1572814136|5.0|I have been reading tarot cards for several years now, and recently my daughter expressed an interest in learning. I bought these to send to her in a care package at college for her 21st birthday. I like that they are the traditional Rider Waite pictures, but are really vibrant and pretty. Yes, they do have an odor, but that will air out. Not something I'm worried about. And yes, they are a little slippery, but usually decks are when you first buy them. Over time and use, they get less slippery. Overall, I'm very happy with the product, and I think my daughter will love them. I am thinking about getting myself a deck, as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I think this may be the best dramatic series ever.  From the very first episode, I was hooked.  The characters are believable and the story lines current and right on top.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It allows me to read on my tablet and on my phone. I can pick up on one where I left off on the other. Very easy to use.<br /><br />However, when I close the app, I must be careful to Close it. If you hit the back arrow key, you loose your place on the device you did it on. I went to the other device and opened to the correct page, read a little and then everything synced again.
0316018953|3.0|I think I've read almost all of Connelly's Harry Bosch books although not in the order in which they were written.  This was the least entertaining of the bunch.  Unlike the others, I was not enthralled enough to read it in a few days - easier to put down for a few days between reading.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game on the kindle is really kickass it's good on my  HTC evo but it's a whole nother level on my kindle it's my fav game n will HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT..keep them coming
B00068TJM6|5.0|Being  huge Seiko fanatic, it was love at first sight with the Seiko SNA411. It is simply a work of art and of course the Seiko quality is outstanding. I love watches to a point of obsession however, this has captivated me in many ways, At the present time it is a going out watch due to the fact I am still reading the three small books that came with the watch operating manuals. This watch is basically a calculator, once all systems are learned it becomes a precision tool. For a truly technical review search the amazon reviews as someone took the time to post a very detail review which was the culminating factor in making my purchase of this watch, I am sure you will not find a negative review on this product. Enjoy it.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Average game with lots to add. Fed up with all the Facebook stuff, though. It can be difficult to earn invest points and its very tempting to buy more to expand territory or up grade stuff.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Bought it at least 6 times to give to friends and family. Very powerful read. I often pick it up and turn to a random page when I'm feeling down
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's been 4 years since I tore through a book just for fun.<br />This is a book that wasn't homework
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|Margaret Atwood becomes a victim of her own stature.  The prose is in that lyrical Atwood style familiar to those who caught Oryx and Crake and Year of the Flood and most others of her work.  And here we come away with some disappointment.<br /><br />MaddAdam continues directly where YOTF left off.  So do not pick this book up unless you've re-read YOTF recently.<br /><br />Ignore the \\"cyber-speak\\" that is seriously over the top and so completely laughable but this is the style Atwood has come to paint her bits of cyberspace.  Much like how Gibson stylizes in Neuromancer.  Admittedly, I found myself literally skipping large sections of rambling text just to get the point of all of it.<br /><br />Good:<br />-  It is an Atwood novel - so it is quality<br />-  Well tied up plot lines (with some complaints)<br />-  Entertaining back-story<br />-  Telepathic blue-butt transgenic humans hung like horses<br />-  Telepathic GMO piggies that do not like being turned into bacon<br />-  Hilarious religion building<br /><br />Bad:<br />-  It is an Atwood novel - so it gets compared to prior novels<br />-  Rambling prose gets worse than before<br />-  Some loose ends are just too much of a stretch<br />-  Not enough \\"screen time\\" for some characters<br />-  Craker dispositions are a little tedious<br /><br />::Spoilers Ahead::<br /><br />Toby is revealed to be human - surprise! Possessing of very human insecurities when it comes to relationships and love.  A very sharp contrast to the level headed-ness we've come to respect in YOTF but underscoring her lack of experience in that aspect of her life. That said, I would have expected Toby to be more level headed and emotionally steady given all she's been through and her age.  But the inner eye we are privy to does sharply contrast with her words and actions - and this paints her as fairly mature overall.  At a point, I felt that this novel failed the Bechdel test - no it doesn't but it sure feels that way at parts and internal dialogue doesn't qualify.<br /><br />Shacked up with the Maddaddamites, Crakers and eventually Pigoons, she plays a central role and it is around her that the many tales are woven.<br /><br />Amanda is deadened with severe PTSD.  Completely understandable given what she has been through.  The power balance between her and Ren shifts so clearly and \\"rightly\\".  Ren is forced to \\"grow up\\" and she picks up the slack.  Unfortunately, not enough is given over to her continuing story.<br /><br />Snowman-the-Jimmy is comatose for the most part of the story.  While he never was a very likable character, he was at least a very realistic Joe Average.<br /><br />The strongest parts of this novel are those of Zeb.  A mostly ancillary character for much of the prior novels, MA fills in the back story and golly the world is a really tiny space.  Individuals in OR and YOTF are found to be very tightly bound with each other.  And Zeb's back story is more interesting than most.  Perhaps a little too incredible.  But it is through his disposition that we fill in the blanks from OR and YOTF.<br /><br />The weakness of this novel - besides the overly written cyber-speak and rambling prose here and there (it could have been edited tighter), is that some of the ideas just stretch towards incredulity.  Firstly, genetically modifying humans to that level is literally unimaginable.  We have not yet come so far as to be able to insert genes willy-nilly without knowing what really happens - in humans.  Secondly, it is quite inconceivable that the world would be sufficiently depopulated of humans as to cause extinction fast enough.  The Crakers will eventually encounter other groups of humans... and they are woefully unprepared for any such encounter.  Thirdly, some Crakers have telepathy and are able to telepathically communicate with genetically modified pigs???  Contrasting this with the religion building taking place throughout the novel, this special power literally trumps any religious concept possible but is clearly overlooked.<br /><br />A small positive is the religion building itself.  Which is really hilarious.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Good sound for the price. The long cord allows for considerable movement. However it was really difficult to get the battery into the device...it actually took two of us...one to  hold the spring out of the way, while the other forced the battery into place.
B0053F042G|4.0|I have no idea why I didn't hear about this when it was in the theaters...super good.  Perfect amount of suspense along with the story line.  Thought it was great!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|It Doesn't work all the time. It takes a long time to pick up the tracking. And once it finds you it loses you all the time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I gave this show a five star rating.  Why? This show has incredible actors, a great story line, and incredible scenery of the Britain landscape.  Watching this show takes me to another time and place.  It is a great escape from the real world and a much better than watching &#34;Days of out Lives.&#34;
B009NQZVKG|4.0|The Sigma Force group never lets you down. Rollicking good tale that keeps the continuing story lines going while the main plot sizzles.
B00821OX98|4.0|I gave this a four star rating.  I love the story-line and the special effects are decent.  Since I really like sci-fy movies this series took to my liking. There seems to be a good variety of plots as well as action scenes. I would highly recommend this to people.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|When this game works it is very enjoyable, however it freezes up A LOT!!!! It seems to work better on the ipad. I finally had to stop playing on my kindle. If you would want to play bingo on the kindle don't bother getting this app it hardly ever works!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was totally amazing. It was like the best book I ever read. I can't wait until I see the second book.

B007VPLNGW|5.0|Great game for young kids my daughter loves it. Pretty good for adults too good game more words needed done
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I could write a book on how much I enjoyed this book and this series. It really is brillant! It is not for everyone however. The author assumes the reader is intelligent and doesn't spoon feed you information. This allows you to figure things out for yourself. Which I really enjoy.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|Madonna Celebration: The Video Collection could have been 5 Stars if the following 8 must have videos were included: Dress you up, Gambler, Over and Over, Where's The Party, Physical Attraction, Everybody, Causing A Commotion the live concert from Ciao Italia and Holiday the live concert in Houston.  Madonna should release a new DVD with all the 8 must have videos I just mentioned in it.  It will be sold out for sure. It will complete the Madonna Videos Collection. And Madonna should release the 1985 The Virgin Tour Concert in DVD. It will be sold out for sure since it's only released in VHS. All the Madonna fans will definitely purchase it.
B008NMT684|4.0|cute graphics  simple puzzles.  having to drag pieces into place is too hard for toddlers...not to mention the expanding sizes of pieces as the are dragged into position.  better for preschooler aged kids
B00AG475K8|5.0|It's romantic & funny and it's got drama, style, good  music, etc.  It's about friendship that eventually develops into love.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|It was funny. It made us laugh and cry. Barbra made an excellent cast member. We wished she was in more movies! Rogen wasn't so bad either!
B00AG473GE|5.0|One of the best teen 80's movies.  It's about true friendship, school life struggles and love.  It was fun, emotional and memorable.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I fell asleep! I got through about halfway and just couldn't stay awake. It was boring!<br />I heard so much on TV and read so much about how good it was, and I just couldn't see it!
B00AEFXXMI|4.0|This movie was so popular when it came out in the 80's.  This was like the favorite movie of most of the teenagers back then.<br />It's about school life, friendship, love and family issues.
B0045INOD8|5.0|A must see film. That said, you have to be in the right mind set to really appreciate this movie.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Enjoyed this movie with it's complex twists and turns - Not a great commentary on the drug industry, shrinks, or society in<br />general..thought provoking
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This has not been helpful at all to me. The levels about which help is offered are very limited. I'm on level 70 and found no help for that level at all.
B008Q08EG8|4.0|This video was good video.<br />I like this video because it had John Wayne & Jimmy Steward in the video<br />there was nothing that I disliked about the video.<br />I would recommend to this video to any one that likes western videos.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I am so glad that I got this app.  I have been enjoying the videos that are on TED and have been learning a great deal of useful information from these videos.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|If you are looking for watching a cult movie. This is it. Just like many cult movies of last 3 decades, this has unusual dialogues, situations, and yes, acting. There is never a dull moment. When the movie is over, you still keep thinking about it. Some of the situations are so unreal that you know it would never happen. But then you think what if such things happen!<br /><br />You're going either love this fight or hate. You probably will not be able to ignore it!
B005MMYPIE|5.0|Excellent! I had listened to several of their songs on you tube before purchsing, as i expected they are excellent !!!!!!

B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Why Newly Born Babies Can't Talk and Other Stories (Children books) (Tales by Twilight 2) is written beautifully by King Samuel Benson. After reading this authors other work I had to have this new release. African stories that have been handed down for generations by mouth are finally in print. With a slightly modernized version can now be told for more generations without worry of the stories being lost.<br /><br />\\"Why Newborn Babies Can't Talk\\" The tales in this short read tell how babies were born talking and why they don't anymore. This is a very interesting with a good lesson.<br /><br />\\"Why the Tortise is Bald\\" This tale of how the tortoise lost his hair, is quite funny and I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />\\"Why Pigs are Attracted to Refuse Dumps\\" This is a very crafty fairy tale and the moral lessons we learn with each one of these stories is interwoven in a delightful way. I can't wait to read these stories to my grandbabies this weekend. They will make great bedtime stories.<br /><br />If you haven't read King Samuel Benson's other stories, you are missing out on a wonderful storyteller. Here are a few I have read and loved: Tales by Twilight (A collection of African Folktales) and Blood Tournament (2018, #1) Two very different but awesome reads.<br /><br />5 stars for another well written book for the author
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game but I am so tired of having all the ads that keep popping up and before you can play the game you have to watch the whole ad.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Its an awesome media player!!!! The subtitles are great if your default media player doesn't have it !!!!!I can finally watch my naruto shippuden offline!!!!
B004XMMSZG|4.0|Purchased based on an Andy Inhatko recommendation on MacBreak Weekly net cast. Seemed like an inexpensive way to keep my Bose Sound Dock in the game and the CableJive dockBoss exceeded my expectations. The dockBoss pairs easily with my iPhone 5 and works flawlessly. Music audio through my Bose is noticeably less rich than when I'm connected directly to my iPod Touch or even WiFi using an AirPort Express, but the quality is still very good. I listen mostly to spoken podcasts and only occasionally to music (tailgaters, cookouts, etc.) on the Bose Sound Dock so the modest audio quality reduction is not a problem. One huge plus...power demanded by the dockBoss is substantially less than if I have my iPod attached directly (no device battery to suck up a charge) so the battery in my Sound Dock has lots more lasting power. I strongly recommend purchasing this device if you have a non-Bluetooth equipped audio player with a 30-pin dock and want to keep using it long after you've upgraded to an iPhone / iPad with a 9-pin Lightning connector.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Great game. It definitely makes you think. You should check it out, but it's not for the non-mechanically inclined. Good luck
B002ZG976U|5.0|Wonderful feel good movie. As always,Cher does a great job, the music is great and the plot is good.  Highly recommend.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Got this app for my Kindle. It works like a charm. I can now access e-mail other computer or cell phone.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It is good, preferred seasons 1-3 cannot wait for season 5... Love Will and Alisha together.... It's one of the best I've seen
0307950689|5.0|I recently had the pleasure of reading the Lost Symbol by Dan Brown. In this resplendent work, Dan Brown created a beautiful tapestry of philosophy, world religion, and occult sciences. A funny situation happened while finishing the book. I was on a flight returning home. When reading a book, I have a habit of highlighting and writing notes in it. When I began deboarding the plane, a man who was watching me read asked, what was I studying. I responded, the Lost Symbol by Dan Brown. He was not familiar with the title or author. So I then stated, that Dan Brown was the same author of the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and Dante's Inferno, to which the man's wife interjected, \\"Oh it's just fiction\\". I laughed to myself, because everyone is entitled an opinion, and every comment doesn't warrant a response. The thing I do know is that since the days of the ancient mystery system some of the most occult subjects were disseminated to its aspirants via myths and allegories. Not to mention, when the sages and priests wanted to convey an arcane subject to lay people it was done using the same modality. This holds true even today when you pick up and read your holy text or volume of sacred law (whichever one it may be: Bible, Koran, Bhagavad Gita, Coming Forth By Day and By Night, Torah, Talmud, the Zohar, Book of Thoth, etc.). Although the book's storyline is fictitious, its subjects, history and historical figures, the location of the monuments, sciences discussed, books referenced, and secret orders were all quite real. I recommend this book to all who quest for light, seeing the Big Picture, and man's re-membrance of his divine nature and potential.<br /><br /> Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi (our gold is not ordinary gold).<br />--Gerhard Dorn
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever but I warn you this game will get boring and I don't even play this game anymore but SEVEN STINKIN DOLLARS MAKE IT CHEAPER PLEASE
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Even though this movie is over 30 years, still good entertainment<br />My daughter enjoyed at 4years old (she is now36) and now my 3year old grandson is doing the same!
B00ANAC32U|4.0|Pro: Fits well, Slightly raised on both sides to prevent damage to glass, buttons work well, and connector port isn't blocked.<br /><br />Con: Most headphone jacks do not fit.<br /><br />This case fits snugly to your phone and for such a simple thing as a slip on cover works really well. It also doesn't leave your phone feeling extra bulky or anything. The quality of the material seems superior; hard rubber inner casing with a metal bezel around the outside and the buttons made also from metal.  One down fall for this case is that I am unable to hook up my auxiliary cables with this case on. I would always have to take the case of completely in order to use the port.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied with this case. I'll just have to deal with taking of the case in order to use my auxiliary cables. Can't win it all. :)
B00EEN7CAK|4.0|There is now a book, which expanded upon the original article this movie used as its inspiration.  If you need more depth, it is in the book.  But Sofia Coppolla nails an essential sub culture in Los Angeles today which is young people who aspire to be the people who are famous for being famous.  Since they can't be them, they steal from them instead.<br /><br />One initial big difference between the movie and reality is that the actors portraying the real people are better looking, especially the Asian ringleader girl.  As you see the film versions walk down the street in all of their stolen stuff, they do look as good as their celebrity counterparts.  But of course this is because they ARE the real thing.  Emma Watson, for one, is a much bigger celebrity than Paris Hilton can ever hope to be (because Watson actually has talent).  I wonder if it wouldn't have been a better idea to use more ordinary looking real people.  I would have liked to see all of the bling NOT transforming them into beautiful people.  One exception is that I think the real world guy involved from the very beginning is even better looking than the actor playing him.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because I am an older person that I also found the parenting, or really lack thereof, so fascinating.  Most of these kids were from divorced or blended families.  There were people living in these households who were also rather temporary members whether as pseudo kids or pseudo parents.  There is also no supervision of these young people whatsover.  They can go out any night of the week, party all night, drink, take drugs, etc.,<br /><br />This is not on the same level as Coppolla's best known work LOST IN TRANSLATION.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|I was planning a trip, wanted to take my Kindle Fire, instead of laptop. Downloaded &#34;Dropbox&#34; on Kindle, and dropped any files<br />I thought I would be needing during my trip. Shazzzam!! There they were.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Quite simply the coolest little calculator that I have ever owed. The huge numbers are so easy to read and use, that even someone with my failing eyesight can use it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the different challenging levels and graphics.  It runs well, with no hiccups. I look forward to playing it everyday.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Unbelievable story that kept me up late at night reading. Cheryl did an excellent job of portraying her life journey and the events that led up to her hike on the PCT. Inspiring and moving story of one woman's journey. Highly recommend.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game, can't put it down! I never get bored and love competing with family and friends. It can easily be addictive.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book, surprised I never read it years ago, actually had heard the title but thought it was a video game. Starship Troopers, Wing Commander, Space Above and beyond, Halo and many more have used elements from this work. Just like the Autor was inspired by other authors himself. Looking forward to the movie since I get pleasure from dissecting differences between popular books and the movies that are made from those works.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book reminded me that I need to live my life....not just arrange and support my family's lives.  Well told.  I want to read another of his works now.  But I would like to know if Fatima waited for him...I suppose she did!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I purchased this app cuz I need one to watch some videos but I realized that the app it's very useful, I like it and also recommended.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|When I saw the movie in the theater, I was fairly satisfied with it, but the ending was telegraphed and so predictable that I refuse to purchase this movie.  I'm tired of the same shots & gimmicks repeated over & over  -- how many fight scenes do we need to see on fast-moving vehicles, giant explosions as the hero casually strolls away, characters dead for 5 whole minutes before they are miraculously brought back to life in exactly the way that you expect---in multiple movies-before someone comes up with something new?  This could all get much worse since now they have one guy in charge of both Star Wars AND Star Trek.  Stop using the same stuff over & over, Hollywood!  Iron Man & The Avengers were fresh!
B00DYVESVO|3.0|I bought this book because I thought at $3.99 for a 304 page book, not a bad deal.  I like the Hulk and I expected a good long read.  Turns out this version has only 198 pages to the story and maybe 10 pages of other material.  If this volume really contains 304 pages, I did not see them.  The story itself is not a masterpiece but it good entertainment. However, I am debating whether it is worth four dollars good since I got only 2/3 of what was advertised.
B00005214X|5.0|I love this album. When I opened it, there were 2 copies of disc1. I was out of town, and my return time was gone.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|Remastered, all the original liner notes and the CDs look just like the vinyl version.  A must have for any CLASH fan!
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|The first two days was good great I should say then it said the next day.  Problem with loading process and it was just working great a day ago. It uses up a gigabits of space and it is the worst piece of scrap game.  If it did work I would give this game five stars. But it didn't .  Don't buy the game
B003U4UPHG|3.0|I really didn't like it when they introduced the &#34;others&#34; into the series.  The action at times is very predictable and laughable.  I really enjoyed watching the first season, but the newer season became very hoeky
B007EECSFA|4.0|It was good but a bit drawn out. It did keep me interested all the way to the surprise ending. I am a Kate Morton fan.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I truly enjoyed delving into Ender's world and reading his thoughts. It was difficult to imagine a child thinking or feeling the way he does, but it's a novel...suspension of disbelief is essential to experiencing his world.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think it is awesome.I like this book because it can tell me the definition when I have homework.I love it alot.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|The entire cartoon comes to life with the Blu-ray. This is a great fun buy. This is a movie to be enjoyed for a long time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Product was very easy to follow.  No hidden gimmicks.  Hours of endless mind games.  A must for anyone. Hidden objects will test your eyes and mind.
B00BJKZVRC|5.0|This record allows you to feel as if you are in the studio during the recoding. This is surround sound at its best!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I watched the movie and never heard of this guy.  What a piece of American music that is awesome.  Good to see the South Africans attempted to locate Sixto.  I purchase the Coming from Reality CD as well and equally impressive.  Love the horns in the background.  Also love the Amazon Cloud Music Player.  I'm hooked and loaded on my iPhone.
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|its like Doodle jump but it is addicting great app verry verry good I love it got to have it
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw the movie and had to have all his music.  What a shame about how this piece of American Talent got screwed by the record company.  Nice to see that today's technology with downloading music can benefit Sixto.  Awesome music and I want more.  You won't be let down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best series I have read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  A must for any science fiction fan.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a fun game my nieces and nephews enjoy playing the game! Thanks again for the great game! Make it easier to get more acorns.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|One of those stupid funny movies that you need to watch at least one time. I've watched it a few times and have caught new things I didn't catch originally.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|With its superb cast, a story that is compelling, this movie should be in everyone's collection. It is good to see senior actors in worthwile roles, with sensitive direction by Dustin Hoffman. Bravo to all.
B00E3UN44W|1.0|This series has been produced. In interviews with the principals, no details have been mentioned. But given the quality of the first 2 series, I frankly can't wait.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Reads like an extra-long NYT Magazine feature, insightful und fluid. A bit too much of a grab bag at times and the author cannot resist temptation to reduce personal, organizational and societal phenomena to the same habit routine. The book is strongest in its first part regarding personal habits - less convincing in the second and third parts, where in spite of the erudite and well-researched  chapters some things feel overly simplistic or already known. Regular readers of the Times will find many chapters familiar.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|I did enjoy 'Steal Like an Artist' but it was not very profound. Only AFTER you have been a creative practitioner for a long time, do you 'get' what Austin Kleon Is trying to say. Good book to give to your still-struggling artist friends as a token reminder.....
B00340ESIS|3.0|This book is well-written and insightful - a bit too smart for it's own good. It is a good foundation, but won't guarantee success... even though the author can't help himself to suggest that he can.
0061564893|4.0|I loved the book. Before reading it, I had already heard theories about the Chinese sailing the world before Magellan, but had never heard any substantiating evidence. This book provides that. The author discusses many theories throughout the book and backs them up with substantial evidence. The author was also not afraid to say so when he felt more evidence was needed to back his theories, so things are presented more in a &#34;here are the possibilities&#34; manor rather than &#34;this is the truth&#34;, so there is room for you to postulate your own. If you are interested in learning more about China's lost history, I strongly suggest reading this book.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started watching the TV series, then I found it was based on a book series. The books as always gives more depth and detail than the TV series could possibly do. I Love it.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|New update crashes app. Tried to re install and no go. Lost all my previous scores and unlocks. Fix this. The fact that I paid for this app makes this even more frustrating.
B000002UHG|4.0|A good Cd, nice and jazzie, remined me of the early Pink Floyd music, Rick Wright wounderfuly playing the keyboards
B00932A4XE|5.0|this is my favorite movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its funny, sad, and hilarious. It made me want to watch it over agin.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Only saw half of the show due to a data limit but loved what I saw. I will finish it next month.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|Really like how their sound has developed. Great energy songs, not too dragged down by slower ones. Very little whinning.
1423141997|5.0|The 2nd book in the series was a great continuation of the Percy Jackson story. Getting back to, you know, Percy Jackson.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|It just wasn't my type of reading. It didn't do much for me. I like a different type of reading.
B00013M6NK|1.0|it only worked sometimes.  as i was traelling in kenya i was very disappointed.  when i got to the five star lodge, they began charging my battery for me and told me that my charger was the wrong kind for the camera i had.  so i just bought a second onebecause there are many nikon battery chargers and S10 only works SOMETIMES for a 510.....
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Aronofsky is really the only American director that is on par with the incredible talent that is flooding our shores from Britain.  This movie is by far one of his best movies using symbolism and literary devices.  It is truly a work of art with great performances from all the actors.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It's great. Keeps time well. Not fad or slow like some reviews indicate. Love it. Great price. No problems here.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|After the first page I was hooked. We never really know what our destiny is but with determination and patience we will find it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|There is no doubt this is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. And I am not a gamer. I was an avid reader but since I have started playing this game I don't read as much.
B00B8WXFWE|3.0|Love The Block. This was more of a slow song album. I like the more upbeat songs and was hoping to hear more from other artists and New Kids.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I loved it!  It had everything, intrigue, humor, romance, and mystery with sadness. Would like to read all of the author's stories.
B004G600A4|5.0|I rented this movie and loved it so much that I had to order it. I enjoyed watching this with my three sons. Who knew a movie like this would appeal to boys as well. But it did.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I love this movie.  The combo package is just what  I was looking for to allow viewing anywhere I go
0451232852|5.0|History comes to life!Should be h.s. text book!  Already began the second book and it is equally  well done.  Hooray it is a trilogy!
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Figured, I would catch up on Thor and Cappy 'Murica while waiting for the next Avengers to come out. This was a pretty good movie. Much better than Thor in my opinion. Clearly not as good as Iron Man though.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The previews looked pathetic. For Judge Dredd fans, however, this movie offers tremendous relief (and reward!) for those who were terribly injured (and disappointed) with the 1995 film Judge Dredd.<br /><br />What I needed was escapist reward. And this hit the spot. Actually \\"hit\\" is less than spot on. More like eviscerated the spot. Ultra-violent yet cartoony so it matches the comic precisely in that regard.<br /><br />The plot device of the super-drug that is the center of all mayhem is well-played, even inspired. You can practically imagine the comic book portraying this storyline!<br /><br />So what's next? A proper rendition of Tank Girl? (Oh please oh please oh please!)
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I didn't know what to expect with this one but anytime a comic book movie is rated R I tend to be a bit happier, especially when it means the movie will be truer to the comic in it's essence. In that sense it did not disappoint. The movie was extremely brutal.Good stuff.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The Searchers is not only the best western John Wayne ever made, but ties with &#34;The Quiet Man&#34; as simply the best movies he ever made!
B005H9B44A|3.0|Wanted to catch up on the solo films before Avengers 2 came out. This movie wasn't horrible, but I also wouldn't say it was great. Thor is clearly a kicker of asses but the plot was kinda meh.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a great book about friendship and never judge someone by their looks just look what's in their heart or inside.
B00957T6X6|5.0|These books are amazingly written with details of clarity and emotion. I am reading them for the second time and they are just as enthralling as the first time around.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book!!  Inspired me to walk into my boss's office, pound on the table and talk about the raise I deserve.  And he ended up admiring me for it.  Highly recommended for a working woman.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. I find it to be like brain training except fun. If you enjoy puzzles, solving problems, or card games, this version of spider is for you. You can play at many levels and with up to 4 different suits. I enjoy competing so winning hands are my favorite ones. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys solitary games.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book really breaks down how important your habits really are - they're what make you YOU!  Great book if you're interested in reflecting on your own life and learning about easy way to become a better version of you.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 4 yr old neice figured out how to toggle to the other items to use for the hair...geezz.... but she created lots of hair combinations and came back serveral times and asked to play again
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Unusual story - enjoyed it<br />Would not have wanted to see in a theatre but was good for watching at home.
0062255657|5.0|This was a wonderful story, beautifully written. My only comment to the contrary is that it should have been part of a collection rather than sold as a stand alone book at regular price.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The hidden object game is very good....It makes you think while playing and it is lots of fun.  Try it...If you like these kinds of games you will love this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this quick read.  It was exciting and kept my attention the entire time.  I think Suzanne Collins has outdone herself.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Although the book is about historic events, which at first seems a bit dull, it is a great read. The fictional characters added to the plot combine greatly with the authentic historic people and events. A great way to learn about the blueprints of the WW2. But don't worry  you read like a normal fiction title not like a historic text book.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I've been a fan of Earth, Wind & Fire since the early '70s, when rushing the local record store to pick up a copy of the super group's latest album the day it was released was truly an event.  So I'm the first person to hop on it when I hear about the impending release of a new EWF collection -- even after the passage of four decades!  I pre-ordered \\"Now, Then & Forever\\" the moment I heard about its impending release, of course.  But I have to admit I didn't have particularly high hopes for the new project, given Maurice White's waning involvement in EWF and other changes in the musical scene that have rendered the super group less relevant over the years.  Wow, was I wrong!  Many of the reviews of \\"Now, Then, & Forever\\" have compared it to 2005's Grammy-nominated \\"Illumination,\\" concluding that the latest collection almost matches the former one in terms of quality.  I have to disagree.  I think \\"Now, Then & Forever,\\" surpasses \\"Illumination\\" because of its musical unity -- the way the tracks work together -- evoking the heyday of EWF more than any release since the 1980s.  \\"Illumination,\\" while featuring some individually amazing tracks, felt bloated to me as a whole.  It contained about five tracks too many and its foregrounding of guest artists diluted the EWF sound.  By contrast, \\"Now, Then & Forever's\\" carefully selected 10 tracks is pure EWF.  (Sometimes less really is more!)  They flow nicely into one another in terms of tempo, arrangement, and musical genre, setting an overall mood that represents a refreshing return to form for the Elements.  While Philip Bailey had a hand in writing most of the tracks, a talented group of names long associated with the super group (e.g., Larry Dunn, Jerry Hey, and Allee Willis, etc.) are credited for helping to pull this excellent project together.  I've listened to two of the collection's standout tracks, \\"Love is Law\\" and \\"Got to Be Love,\\" alongside some EWF classics and the new tracks still sound good.  (Not an easy accomplishment!).  Both of these new tracks are simply irresistible.  They both prominently feature Verdine White's thumping bass lines, Philip Bailey's seasoned falsetto, and the feel-good lyrics we have come to expect from EWF.  Like the great EWF collections of years past, I also find the other tracks -- e.g., the jazzy tone poem \\"Splashes,\\" the Latin-inspired instrumental \\"Belo Horizonte,\\" and the upbeat message track \\"Sign On\\" (which leads off the collection) -- seducing me more and more with each replay.  I read in one review that to prepare themselves for creating this new collection, the remaining members of the group went back to their roots by closely studying the entire EWF discography.  It shows.  I'm grateful that in a popular music era dominated by digital media, marketing, and packaging, timeless musicians are still able to find the space to produce music with substance.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice app to have if you are a tradesman and are interested in knowing what to expect before leaving the house
0385742886|4.0|The Kill Order<br />I recently read a book called \\"the Kill Order\\" by James Dashner. In this prequel, to \\"The Maze Runner\\" trilogy, it a very well written book and I thought it was a fantastic read. It introduced the reader to the series very well, although it definitely is not needed to be read before the other books in order to understand the plot. One could simply jump right in to the series (almost literally) and still have a great read. Here is why.<br />When starting the Maze Runner, I remember you being introduced to the Glade, as the reader is coming out of the box, and you have no idea what is going on. It later explains what is happening, and fills you in on the plot and the storyline, and you would almost feel bad if you didn't keep reading this book. The Kill order is similar. It introduces Mark, and shows how he has somewhat peaceful day to begin with. Although, the reader has no idea who he is, where they are, or anything about the character. All we know is that this was after the sun flares hit.<br />It was a bit hard for me to understand for a little while, because I was wondering where the flare was. I thought the flare came from the solar flares, and I was wondering why no one was running around screaming \\"I'm a crank!\\" It later explains that the flare (the virus that affects the brain and literally makes you go insane) was a manmade virus, to reduce the population of the world, simply because there were too many people and not enough resources. Honestly, I thought this possibly could have been the dumbest way to do this out of the other infinite amount of ways.<br />Through the whole book, your heart is pounding, because you are wondering what is going to happen to Mark and his friends. They survive the Berg onslaught that hits on what was supposed to be \\"Mark's perfect day\\", they survive a jungle full of crazies, and they go through a lot more as the journey goes on. Again, this was a great read for people who like nonstop action, that will keepyour heart pumping, and for those who like thrillers, this is a great read.
B004XWMXX8|4.0|There's a lot of good songs on this track..... but not her best album.  The songs: love you like a love song, who says, and dices, are the only real good ones!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Well documented, but uses popular, jargon infested language.  Interesting read, but aimed for the masses.  Not a scientific treatise, but with plenty of highly regarded scientific data supporting his theory.  For me it would have been more credible if it had sounded more dispassionate rather than a &#34;push poll&#34;.
0486282112|4.0|Required reading for my AP English class although I have had this as required reading before.  Interesting book, not my favorite, but definitely a classic.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This gives you a great lesson in music history and helps you understand a transitionary period of time from analog to digital.  Really entertaining and educational.  I loved it.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|I am disappointed in this book.  Dawkins is an academic but reverts to name calling of religious people.  It must be the evolutionary process of Darwinism.  I expected a much higher intellectual written book from a scientist.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I just got this game am really liking this game. Am gonna get my mom hooked on this game to.
B008LODRT8|5.0|Book was in good condition, and was a great book to end the trilogy.  I got the book quick and in great shape
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was is excellent book.  Excellent pacing.  Excellent character development.  Excellent descriptions.  The fact that I was an 80s video game kid made it even more enjoyable.  You don't have to be an Video Game kid to enjoy this though.  It is a really good book.  Highly recommended.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I would have liked to read more about the Japanese gardener and the kid.  It was a really great book
1400069181|5.0|Great book! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to make a change in the world! Seriously inspiring! It's an easy read with tons of insight.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I'm in no way an Apple fanboy. But I was intrigued to know more about Jobs. The book is well written. Although at times, the constant repetition of some stories/facts gets annoying at times. It's as though it was written in the style of a TV documentary, which reminds you right after the ad-break of what just happened. Maybe Apple fanboys have attention spans of knats, which warranted this style of writing. I don't know. Worth the read though.
144236419X|5.0|First book I read from this author. What insight and tragedy into this culture. At times it just made my mind reel. Glad I bought it
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Seriously. I mean it. Bob Mason's recollections of his time in Vietnam, coupled together with his narrative style that makes you feel you are there alongside him during his missions, or the lull between fire fights, is unmatched. I've read this book at least five times, and I never tire of it. Even if you're not a pilot, you'll still appreciate this little literary gem.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good page turner!  Liked the ending the best. What could have... , would have..<br />Very creative ending with possibilities.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Interesting reading...relevant to what I expected! Things I have seen in other books but the author has a particular way of expressing it that made it like I was having a conversation with a friend. I enjoyed it very much. Will read it again soon!
B00EEN7CAK|1.0|I watched this movie to gain perspective about the thefts, find out more information, or simply be entertained.  Each nor any of these expectations was not met.  It was terrible.  I kept watching the time left bar thinking &#34;Okay....70 minutes left, 40 minutes left, 20 minutes left before something pivotal happens.  I love all genres of film, and even with a personality descriptor such as &#34;easy to entertain&#34;, I was severely disappointed.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|My daughter's the Brony/ponygirl/whatever they call themselves, and she had talked about Equestria Girls for over a year before its release, so I picked it up off Amazon for her birthday. This of course meant she expected us all to watch it, and we dragged our feet as long as we could...and then consented.<br />It's not bad, it's only 1.25 hours in length, has some catchy songs, has a positive and benign message about friendship and whatever..so, I wouldn't have bought it for me, and I won't be buying a Fluttershy hoodie anytime soon, but I've wasted 2 1/2 hours on movies much worse than this one. If you're a Brony, you're going to love it, I suppose.
B003U53GK8|5.0|This was a great show. Suspenseful, funny, and had great love stories. The ending tied up everything we had questions about! ...well almost everything!
B00E3D7WGU|3.0|The actual MDNA tour was amazing (I attended the concert in Houston)but when I was watching this... The magic that Madonna created on stage was drowned with over-production and as if that isn't bad enough, the clips in each performance constantly change to the point that it becomes difficult to keep up. I own the DVD copy of \\"The Confessions Tour\\" and that is by far her best recorded show to date,this is average at best... Someone PLEASE fire the guy who edited this. We waited so long for this DVD only to receive mediocre editing.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Very interesting about the Nazi officer's family trying to live a normal life and living next to the prison camps where Germans are being gassed and starved to death.  I feel his own selfish work for Germany was the end of a happy life in the end when he lost his own son.  Also we see an innocent child with no prejudices befriend the so-called enemy.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone who has read about he concentration camps and torture done to he Jews.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Tough enough to make you think but not so difficult that you become frustrated. However it is very short. Worth having for free but in its. Current length not worth buying
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful, as new stars keep coming on the scene.  Mary left to raise baby alone, maybe??  The mansion is saved from bankruptcy,<br />and perhaps marriage in the works for the &#34;ugly&#34; sister.
