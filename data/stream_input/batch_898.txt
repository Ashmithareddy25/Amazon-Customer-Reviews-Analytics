B001XJEKGC|2.0|On paper this concert concept is a can't miss idea. I ran out and bought the DVD and the CD the first week it came out. For me anyway it was a real disappointment. I am not discrediting the talent there, it is obvious. The problem is there is no chemistry, spontaneity, or anything new here at all. Dinosaur Rock. They might not have played some of these songs for a long time but they sure played them like they were right off of the original vinyl pressings.    I am jaded here because at the same time that I picked up these titles I also picked up Jeff Beck: Live at Ronnie Scott's. Oh my goodness what a difference!    Beck is a visionary and a virtuoso that has more feel, touch, and soul than anything Clapton or Winwood display during their set. Interesting too is that Clapton appears on the Beck DVD as well.    The set list of the Clapton/Winwood performance mystifies me. Clapton pulls out several Clapton pieces and Winwood is noticeably neglected... I could have handled Clapton playing along on \\"Higher Love\\", \\"Roll With It\\", or even \\"Gimmie Some Lovin'\\".     What Clapton captured with Cream at the Royal Albert Hall is missing from this show... The music was tired, not like being in that place was special... they sounded if they had been touring for the past 30 years and had played out all of the emotion. Most of you loved it and you are lucky.. I was right there at the door but it did not open for me.
B001Q8PC8A|3.0|Actors of the stature of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino deserve to have the best offered to them. Unfortunately it seems that actors in their age bracket rarely receive those phone calls. Instead they are offered roles that are decent enough but nowhere near those they played before, roles that helped them gain the notoriety that they now enjoy. Such is the case with RIGHTEOUS KILL.<br /><br />De Niro and Pacino play NYPD detectives Tom \\"Turk\\" Cowan and David \\"Rooster\\" Fisk. As the film opens we see what is apparently a confession by Cowan to the murder of 14 victims beginning 4 years prior. From there the film moves into flashback mode and the tale unfolds.<br /><br />At that time a suspect in a murder case is released due to insufficient evidence. Everyone knows he did it, but he still gets off. In an attempt to see justice done, Fisk plants a gun taken from evidence in the suspect's bedroom while Cowan at first attempts to stop him then lets it happen. This results in the suspect being arrested and convicted of a murder he did not commit, but at least justice is done, right?<br /><br />Moving forward to just weeks before the film's opening sequence, the duo is staking out a club run by an up and coming rap artists named Spider. Witnessing a woman named Jessica using cocaine in the club, the pair plan on running a sting operation to take Spider and his drugs off the street. With the help of their less than willing witness, they plant a listening device on her and send her in to set up Spider. But Spider realizes what is happening and with the possible threat of violence, the pair breaks in to stop him. Caught in their own bit of entrapment, a shoot out follows and Jessica is shot as is Spider's bodyguard.<br /><br />The case is blown. Procedure was not followed and an arrest, let alone a conviction, is not about to happen in the foreseeable future. Spider walks.<br /><br />As the film progresses, various other cases come to the attention of Cowan and Fisk. At each one a poem is left with the body. It seems they have a vigilante serial killer on the loose and he's taking out various suspects who were let off from the crimes they committed due to technicalities. As they look deeper into the case, both men come to the conclusion that the perpetrator to the crime could be someone who works on the police force.<br /><br />With few leads to follow and never knowing who to trust, the pair continue their investigation. The only people they feel they can trust are each other. But after hours drinks and a few secrets let lose make both men realize that the other is not quite who they thought them to be. Fisk always looked up to Cowan as his hero, his inspiration. And Cowan always thought of Fisk as a stand up guy he could count on. Both men end the film in disappointment.<br /><br />As the culmination of their investigation comes to a close, the setting drops back to Spider's club. With Spider in the mix as well as the gun toting thugs he hires to protect him, you can be sure a shooting is in the mix.<br /><br />Prior to the final moments of the film, most movie lovers will guess who the killer is. But that doesn't mean I'll spoil it for those who don't. Both actors seem to be walking through these roles without a ton of enthusiasm. It doesn't lessen what they have to offer, but one would think after waiting for just the right movie to be able to work together again in they would have found something a bit better than this.<br /><br />Which is odd. Because while the film may not meet the standards I have in my own mind for these actors, it is actually a relatively decent film. The story seems as if it could happen and the possibility of someone going off the end after years of watching suspects set free is plausible enough, though one hopes it's never happened.<br /><br />The rest of the cast include 50 Cent as Spider, Carla Gugino as Karen Corelli (Cowan's love interest), John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as fellow detectives and Brian Dennehy as the their supervisor. All turn in well done performances and it's nice to see Dennehy on screen again.<br /><br />Is this movie worth renting and watching? Certainly. It's far better than a number of films released. Is it worth adding to your collection? I would say for die hard fans of the two actors only. Anything either of them decides to do make their performances worth watching. They elevate things they are in. This movie doesn't drop their standing in the least.'s nice to see Dennehy on screen again.    Is this movie worth renting and watching? Certainly.

B001C48EF6|4.0|Well, I came to this one rather dreading it.  National critics had given it something of a bashing.  But it is super!    Young Victoria was the only surviving issue of several sons of George III (\\"Farmer George\\").  Two of her uncles, George IV (who made Brighton Pavilion) and his brother William IV (known as the \\"Sailor King\\" and \\"Silly Billy\\"), preceded her as monarch.  Unfortunately for Victoria, her father, the Duke of Kent, died very early and her mother, the Duchess, fell under the spell of - not to put too fine a point on it - a conman in the shape of (later knighted as \\"Sir\\") John Conroy.  Sensing the prospect of power, the two of them raised poor Victoria in a repressive background at Kensington Palace, dubbing their tyrannical regime \\"The Kensington System.\\"    This is where the film starts.  I loved it.  Victoria is played with emotional literacy and verve by Emily Blunt.  Miranda Richardson is restrained and blinkered as the Duchess and Mark Strong makes a villainous Conroy, slapping Victoria as she refuses to sign a document making him Regent.    Several of the other actors are so good that their identity in the cast list came as a PLEASANT SURPRISE (hence the title of this review).  Jim Broadbent is great as crusty old William IV, asking God to let him hang on until May, when Victoria comes of age.  (Thankfully, she did - and banished Conroy from her Court on her accession.)  Michael Maloney puts in good work as Sir Robert Peel who Victoria clashes with politically.  Paul Bettany is fabulous, if somewhat too young, as Lord Melbourne, Victoria's adviser and crush.    But the honours go to the dashing Rupert Friend, wonderful as Prince Albert.  Albert - German and Royal and not popular with Parliament - is utterly rehabilitated in this film.  It's a beautiful love story in a historical setting.  The romance is made all the more poignant by the knowledge that Albert died after he and Victoria had ruled for 20 years.  She mourned him for the rest of her life.  On the morning afer their wedding night, he lies motionless in bed, almost a precursor of his death, as she passionately surveys him.      The loveliness of romance is underpinned by solid history and politics.  The production values are superb, the research admirable, the storytelling gripping.      So what if it's revisionist in some respects?  I won't be pedantic.  But if you see it and like it, carry on to Christopher Hibbert's superb [[ASIN:0006388434 Queen Victoria: A Personal History]]  and the somewhat less marvellous [[ASIN:0099451824 Becoming Queen]] (a bit novelettish for me).  There's also a nice older TV version, [[ASIN:B00005O7N8 Victoria & Albert]] with a cast including Diana Rigg.    Definitely one to enjoy.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|The g13 gameboard is spectacular; it is relatively easy to set up and works flawlessly.  It's easy to change keys on the fly, and really comfortable under my hand.  It takes up a sizeable amount of real estate on my desk though, and its cord is rather short.  For anyone with a large desk where your tower might not be right next to your seat, the cord requires some sort of extension.  And despite the fact that the keyboard and gameboard work so well together, the keyboard is not powered well enough to support the gameboard being plugged into it.

B001GCUNWG|5.0|\\"Ice Age 3\\" when I saw it kept the kids in the audience enthralled and screaming with delight every time characters were speeding downhill or falling into chasms. Adults will find the sound track imaginative and hilarious at times with variations on \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\" (one a fun tango version) including the dynamic vocal rendition by Lou Rawls himself. The \\"Adagio from Spartacus\\" by Khachaturian and Chad Fischer's \\"Alone Again (Naturally)\\" will also seem clever by their juxtaposition at the oddest moments.<br /> Two prehistoric Ice Age squirrels, Scrat and Sratt&egrave;, turn up in frequent episodes independent of the main plot fighting over a giant acorn. They'll remind old timers of the short cartoons of yesteryear like Roadrunner and Woody the Woodpecker. Free falls from extreme heights, splats, flattenings, catapults into space, chases, and flirtations make the whole thing wacky fun.<br /> Familiar characters from previous Ice Age outings show up in this \\"Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" sequel including the two mammoths Manny (voice of Ray Romano) and expectant mother Ellie (voice of Queen Latifah), Sid, the sloth (voice of John Leguizamo), Diego, the saber-tooth tiger, and assorted smaller animals. A new character, Buck, a pirate weasel with a leaf as an eye-patch, shows up, and he's on a quest to kill the giant raptor dinosaur who has blinded him in one eye. (Captain Ahab, anyone?).<br /> The main character is Sid the Sloth who is lonely and \\"adopts\\" three dinosaur eggs that hatch and become his babies. From that point on there are all kinds of scary adventures with teetering rock platforms, red hot lava, falling off cliffs--these hair-raisers come up as the animal family tries to rescue Sid from the clutches of the T-Rex.<br /> The movie is full of funny situations, gags, and some adult humor that will go over the heads of little kids. Breakneck speed is an important element in the action sequences, and there are plenty of death-defying falls and enemies to contend with. The computer animation is well done. The walk and gait of the mammoths is particularly effective. This is a film that youngsters will enjoy, and it won't be a chore for adults to see with them or on their own.d with.

B000R7GKQE|4.0|I was not a fan of SUPERNATURAL after its first season, and indeed I'm not a huge fan even after Seasons Two and Three.  But there is no question that that show made some major strides forward in its sophomore and junior years, deepening the storylines and finding new and innovative ways to structure episodes.  Because one of the biggest problems with the show in Season One was its episodic \\"demon of the week\\" narrative structure, the show grew far more interesting and engaging.<br /><br />In these two seasons SUPERNATURAL also became a far more playful show, willing to engage in self-parody and capable of poking fun at itself.  In a way, this mimics the way that one of the shows that has most influenced the series, THE X-FILES, grew.  That show for the first couple of episodes was almost unceasingly serious.  It was a great show despite this, but it really took off once -- especially with several extraordinary scripts by Darin Morgan -- when it began mixing in comic episodes.  Season Two of THE X-FILES saw a mildly comic (though mainly jut flat out weird) scripted by Morgan, late in Season Two about circus freaks entitled \\"Humbug.\\"  But the first out and out laugh fest was another Morgan script, \\"War of the Coprophages,\\" in which Mulder and a scientist named Bambi do battle against cockroaches.  (Darin Morgan only wrote a half dozen scripts for THE X-FILES, but four of those would be among the ten best X-FILES episodes ever, one of them the Emmy Award winning episode \\"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose,\\" which is one of the finest TV episodes of all time, garnering an Emmy not just for Morgan but for guest actor Peter Boyle.)  Certainly THE X-FILES seemed to be an even greater influence on SUPERNATURAL in these two seasons than in Season One.  One Season Two episode, in which Sam and Dean give offer Bobby differing accounts of events calls to mind THE X-FILES episode \\"Bad Blood,\\" in which Mulder and Scully give contradictory reports of events surrounding vampires in Texas (along with a sheriff played by Luke Wilson -- both episodes were among the dozens of TV episodes or movies loosely based over the years on the great Kurosawa film RASHOMON, which details four incompatible accounts of events in the woods in medieval Japan).  I don't know how much of this can be credited to Ben Edlund (creator of THE TICK in all his forms, as well as a writer on FIREFLY and ANGEL) joining the writing staff.  But in every way the writing in these two seasons showed a sharp increase in sophistication and flexibility.  The scripts in Season One were stiff, uninteresting, and frequently just flat out boring.  That was rarely the case as the show progressed.  No doubt part of the improvement stemmed from the producers gaining new concessions from the CW, which surely allowed them to stray away from the standalone, episodic format that so thoroughly hampered the show in Season One.<br /><br />I frankly found just about every episode in Season One of the show to be completely forgettable.  But several episodes in Seasons Two and Three stand out.  For instance, one particularly good episode in Season Two does some great twists on the genie legends, with the help of an excellent guest performance by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's Tricia Helfer.  That episode is emblematic of the new maturity of the show.  I can honestly say that I was not surprised (nor scared) by a single thing that happened in Season One.  It was almost intentionally predictable.  But in Helfer's episode there were some truly interesting twists and surprises.  In just about every way, the show got better in these two seasons.<br /><br />I'm still not what one might term a major fan of the show.  Even after three seasons it is a fairly conservative show.  It certainly has done little to redefine the horror genre and it has not expanded the scope of horror or fantasy in the way that either THE X-FILES or BUFFY did.  Still, there is a great deal to say for a show that is excellent even if it is notinnovative.  And I admire any series that gets better as it goes along.  I received the first three seasons of the series as a gift, but I frankly did not think I was going to continue with the show after finishing the three sets.  But now I both plan to buy Season Four come this September and DVR the show upon its return this fall (it will be going against a very similar show with what is surely a pretty substantial audience overlap, FRINGE -- why do networks do this? -- the only then that FOX assures in doing this is that both shows will get lower ratings than they might otherwise -- still, FRINGE is a show I really love, so I'll keep up with SUPERNATURAL via DVR).  Hopefully I'll enjoy Season Four as much as Seasons Two and Three.mire any series that gets better as it goes along.

0452286751|5.0|I first read Fountainhead 45 years ago and have frequently returned to it and Atlas Shrugged (which has unfortunately become prophetic).  Rand's gift to us of logic and rational thought has been my rock to cling to in the midst of chaos.  And really, more is learned thru her lovable, insidious villian, Toohey, than the other characters.  He puts into words in his discourse to Keating just before Roark's last trial what you've learned from plot and characters.  No other villian comes close.  \\"I play the stock market of the soul, and I sell short,\\" he says seemingly kidding earlier in the book.  Rand gave us his childhood too, so you see how early his manipulative powers began to bloom.  What an evil genius!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Don't let the pseudo-culturalists sipping on their pino grigio tell you this is a bad flick. The identity of some people is wrapped up in showing you how knowledgeable they are, and they show this by shooting things down. OUTLANDER rocked the balls. Cool monster flick in a unique premise: total scifi monster dropped into a time when people believed in monsters, and didn't have the capacity to understand something might come from another world. That in itself makes it a cool ride. Ron Perlman smashing skulls with a warhammer is the icing on the genre cake. And the dirty-dog writer makes you feel for the monster, but what must be done, must be done. And at the very least, they did a better job of explaining why the main character understands Norse better than in the 13th WARRIOR.

1407109421|1.0|If you are a christian, or at least believe that there is a God and God is good , then you may not want your childern reading these books, or if you let them I advise that you read the series first before allowing them to. the premis of these books, in a nut shell is, God is an evil tyrant, the rebel angels kicked out of heaven are good, and gave humans consousness(spelling?) so we would not just be slaves. In the end the humans who have realized that God is bad, along with the rebel angels, storm heaven and kill God.  pullman uses the missuse of realigon through out history to give creedence to his view that God is evil. This is a very short sighted and naieve view, however children reading this may not understand this and be influenced to believe that religons always act in the way that their god wishes them to, so if a religion acts in a evil way then it is god who is telling them to.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|This is such a feel-good movie it may just go on the market as an antidepressant. The plot is simple: Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to get married, but she has no father to walk her down the aisle. Well, to be more accurate, she has three possible fathers, and she's determined to find out which is the right one. Throw in dreamy Greek islands and a toe-tapping selection of ABBA songs, and you have a recipe for contagious smiles. Meryl Streep plays Sophie's mother Donna, a spirited, independent woman whose carefree youth has been replaced by the hardships of single motherhood and the challenges of running her own business. Streep really shows off her talent both as an actress and a singer, pulling off her role with natural ease. Seyfried also dazzles, doing proud by her hometown of Allentown, PA (I just had to mention that, because I'm also from the Lehigh Valley). Pierce Brosnan's singing did elicit groans of physical pain from the audience, however. MAMA MIA! is not an emotionally or philosophically deep movie, but it does have its poignant moments. The two scenes that pack real emotional power are Streep's performance of \\"The Winner Takes All\\" and the touching \\"Slipping through My Fingers.\\" All in all, MAMA MIA! will have you laughing and will ensure that ABBA songs are stuck in your head for days.
B001VEJ2G2|5.0|There are some nice tunes here and the entire album has a distinctly 1980s feel to it. Some of the songs are rather reminiscent of the Eurythmics circa the \\"Sweet Dreams\\" period, before they went all \\"MTV/stadium/guitarish\\", or even Yazoo. Anyway, La Roux seem to give us an impression of the '80s while not strictly reliving them. The singer's voice is quite high and clear and very young sounding. This album will go down a storm in Japan!<br /><br />My only criticism of this album is that some of the songs sound a little too busy and there is too much going on musically in some of them. Maybe more expansive remixes could sort this out? However, this is a minor issue and generally, I found this album very enjoyable to listen to in my workplace and it has the mark of a good album in that it took me several listens to some of the songs before I \\"got into\\" them properly.<br /><br />La Roux isn't going to change the world or anything even close to that, but their first album is one of the better recordings of 2009, in my opinion.

0385340990|4.0|What gems of information you'll find in the letters written in this book!  Charming, often humorous, often heartbreaking, this series of letters to and from Juliet Ashton reveal a side of World War II not covered in the history books.  The indomitable spirit of Channel Islanders and the loving relationships they forged are at the heart of this tale of what it was like to be occupied by German soldiers during the War.<br /><br />Once Dawsey Adams, a Guernsey Island resident, finds Juliet's name inside a copy of The Selected Essays of Elia and contacts her in London, lives are changed and endearing characters begin to spill forth.  From the first letter written January 8, 1946 till the final missive on September 17, 1946, the reader is treated to life, its lessons, and the way human nature reacts under the most difficult circumstances.<br /><br />Juliet, a popular wartime essayist, is suffering from writer's block but Juliet's correspondence with Dawsey gives her inspiration as she comes to know his friends through his letters.  When she asks to hear from others, she is overwhelmed by the letters and stories that begin to arrive in her post daily.  Isola, Eben, Amelia, Clovis, John Booker, and even the acerbic Adelaide Addison, are just a few of the residents who become so real to Juliet that soon she is on a trip to Guernsey to become enmeshed in their lives and find the tie that brings them all together for her book.  She finds it in Elizabeth, the never seen heroine whose relationship with a German solider shows the Islanders that although the German soldiers wanted to destroy them as a nation many of the individual soldiers were actually kind, generous, and helpful. Elizabeth emerges in everyone's reminisces as the heart of the Channel Island stories.  Whether she was hiding a young slave laborer in her home or standing up for human dignity in a Nazi prison camp, Elizabeth brought all the stories together and provided Juliet with a gift so special you will have to read the book to discover how Elizabeth made Juliet's life complete.<br /><br />This is an uplifting tale of people who learned to deal with unimaginable hardships and losses, but emerged stronger and fortified for the rest of their lives. It also gave me a new favorite quote.  As Isola wrote to Juliet concerning their literary group, \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying a bad book.\\"  This is definitely one of the good books.k to discover how Elizabeth made Juliet's life complete.

B000065KLO|5.0|People who know me will look at the title I gave this review--and if they didn't already think so--say, \\"Oh my, now the poor ol' thing's finally lost it...\\"<br /><br />I can't help it, I really liked this movie. It had all the earmarks of potential disaster for me. I'm not real found of female impersonation, particularly in a sustained artistic form such as a film. Then there are the inevitable comparisons between HEDWIG and other similiar genre like ROCKY HORROR SHOE, PRISCILA OF THE DESERT, etc. I enjoy comedy, and I also enjoy substance. The world of female impersonation/drag queens can be extraordinarily superficial, filled with an angst that can be met with a world weary response like \\"So, what?\\"<br /><br />Let me start with the nuts & bolts, like John Cameron Mitchell's form of gender bending & his musical lyrics & routines. He conveys a great depth to Hedwig without being mired in pathos or mere impersonation. Visually his chracter(s) are stunningly realistic (given the unreality of the world in which s/he lives.) The songs are fantastic, somewhere like a cross between T-Rex & Talking Heads. Some of the animation interjected reminded me of Bjork music videos. Not a great lover of musicals, I found myself actually looking forward to the next number.<br /><br />Pertaining to the Gnostic element, a major theme in the film, it involves Hedwig's relationship with a boy who talks like a Jesus freak, but there is a much deeper level to his spiritual view--and it interacts with Hedwig's views on The Origin of Love. Either intentionally or not, it is almost a classic Gnostic interpretation of The Garden of Eden story of The Fall of Man. The fact that Hedwig invents the name of Tommy Gnostic for her lover may indicate that the artist knew exactly what s/he was doing when it came to the Gnostic theme.<br /><br />I say \\"artist\\" because this film is the creation of a great artist in association with other obviously great artists.<br /><br />It's is EXTREMELY entertaining too.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I just finished watching the entire series over about a 1 week period. I saw almost all of the episodes on TV and just missed so much trying to follow along week to week. Then I purchased the DVD season 1.<br /><br />Wow! This series is just amazing. The writing is some of the best I can remember seeing in a Sc-Fi TV series in a long time since possibly Star Gate SG-1 or Firefly. Sure it's not a perfect tie-in to the movies, but the movies lost me after #2. Movie #3 is good, but #4 was puzzling. This DVD series makes up for all of that.<br /><br />The final episode was so incredibly moving. I can't imagine that I would have felt it as deeply watching each episode one week at a time. Watch these back to back to back and it will have so much more of an impact on you. How many TV shows can you say that about?<br /><br />Really good acting...effects...writing...tensions...stress...plot...<br /><br />This series adds to the Terminator mythology in a very profound way.  For example: How long was the T-888 married to that lady without her suspecting he was a terminator? It made love to her and she totally liked it! Then in the end of course it terminated her! It's what they do!
B000WWEF2U|4.0|When i got this I noticed that the song titles and the lyrics don't seem to match on some of the songs.  'Obsessed by cruelty' seems to have the words volcanic slut in it a whole bunch.  'Pretenders to the throne' is clearly 'Nuctemeron' and 'Witchhammer' is, well, you get the idea.  Anyway, onto the album itself, it is a pretty vicious album with some nice brutal riffage.  It also has some pretty silly lyrics (\\"read satanic bible with f---ing groan\\"  you do what now?)  But that just adds to the fun.        So, after listening to the album a bit I was able to work out a quick 'translation guide'          Deathlike Silence=Intro                                                                                                                                               Obsessed by cruelty=Volcanic slut  Equinox=Proselytism Real  Proslytism Real=Brandish The Sceptre  Brandish The Sceptre= Deathlike silence                               Fall of majesty town=Obsessed by cruelty                               Nuctemeron=Fall of majesty town                               Pretenders to the throne=Nuctemeron                               Witchhammer=Pretenders to the throne                               Volcanic slut=Witchhammer  Hope that helps anyone with similar issues.
B002GTZSZU|4.0|I've purchased every disc release of this movie:  the expensive LaserDisc collector's set, the original DVD release and the subsquent Director's Cut, and this new Blu-Ray of the Director's Cut.  The Blu-Ray release stands head and shoulders above the rest for picture quality, color, and sound.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the original theatrical cut is not available on Blu-Ray as a separate item or as an alternative viewing option on the Director's Cut.  The theatrical cut is the one that most of us saw first and saw over and over again over the course of some 20 years before the Director's Cut was released on DVD.<br /><br />The additional footage in the Director's Cut is interesting but, to me at least, seems intrusive.  It interrupts the flow and tempo I am used to.  There is also a brief scene of female nudity that seems a bit gratuitous.  The scene does, though,  lend some weight to a scene later in the film where you see Constanze's open hostility toward Salieri.  Normally I'm not one to complain about a little female flesh being exposed, but I think the film works well enough without it.<br /><br />Other \\"new\\" scenes follow pretty much the same description:  they are interesting but their necessity is debatable.<br /><br />There is one small addition that I did enjoy, though.  Early in the film, during one of the scenes where the elderly Salieri is confessing (?) to the young priest, Salieri is recounting the episode when he first met the young composer Mozart he'd heard about for so many years.  He was blown away by his talent but outraged and offended by his peurile behavior.  He insisted to the priest that such talent (evident in one composition in particular) could not and should not exist in such a vile and vulgar child.  That brilliant composition simply HAD to be an accident!  Salieri's lines are briefly extended in that moment, and it adds a wonderful touch of menace.  I can't understand why it was cut from the original release.<br /><br />The LaserDisc release included a wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary called \\"The Last Laugh\\".  So far I haven't seen it included in any DVD or Blu-Ray release.  I'm holding on to my LaserDisc player for precisely that reason.  Add that documentary to this Blu-Ray release and you have a slam-dunk 5-star product.<br /><br />Depending on the release version, this Blu-Ray movie may come in book form and include a short bonus CD of some music from the film and a picture booklet.  If you bought/buy the version that comes with the bonus Digital Copy of the film (available at some retailers but harder to find online), bear in mind that the Digital Copy is NOT compatible with iTunes and cannot be loaded to your iPod.  There is no wording on the package to indicate this.  One has to open the Digital Copy booklet to find that out.  The Digital Copy booklet looks the same on the outside as the booklet for the Digital Copies of other movies that ARE compatible with iTunes, so a consumer who has purchased iTunes-compatible Digital Copy-included DVDs before could reasonably assume this one would be compatible also.  That consumer would be wrong.

B001GM28HO|1.0|Try, if you can, to put to one side GaGa's irritating self-obsession and her ridiculous delusion that she's somehow in on a 'party' and is 'sharing it' with us lowly non-famous people, and let's look at the album on it's own merits. Surely it can't be THAT bad, right? She has credentials, after all. She's worked with some respectable collaborators, after all. She can hold a note, after all.<br /><br />Sadly, none of this seems to have counted for much at all. What we have here is the very worst pop sludge, making it's ugly way off the predictable, unoriginal treadmill of weak pop music and into the mindset of the hysterical masses, whose purchases and subsequent success of that which they purchase fool both consumer and artist alike into attributing far more quality to a product like this than it actually warrants.<br /><br />Put simply, this is rubbish. Over indulgent, shallow and completely inconsequential rubbish of the kind we'll look back at in five years time and wonder what on earth so many people were thinking by buying it in large quantities. Presumably GaGa knows this already, hence her insistence on dribbling out barely coherent concepts of her fans being 'part of her lifestyle' (as if it's in any way desirable), and distracting us by flashing her body as if it adds anything other than something most women will cringe at and be rightly embarssed for her about.<br /><br />Given her past contacts, this really is unforgivable tripe. Its success is no justification for it's supposed quality. We all know that if the sheep are spoon-fed something and told it's good by radio stations and celebrity magazines, they'll inevitably lap it up thoughtlessly. Given how many artists are actually putting out decent music that gets overlooked because some trumped up nobody with favourable contacts and a good body puts out garbage like this, it's a real tragedy that everything other than quality seems to be the criteria that measures success.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|It's incredible how much emotion Jeff Beck gets across in these rock tunes without any words at all.  He struts and prances and frets and makes it all sound so easy and playful.  He can be mellow, too, and wail.  It's so cool to hear his electric guitar do the singing and just amazing how he makes it sound.  I read that he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently.  Well deserved.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|After a sketchy second season, the third season of Dexter returned to what was the greatness of the first season.  This season Dexter squares off with a serial killer known as The Skinner, while simultaneously juggling his relationship with his girlfriend, Rita, and dealing with the drama that is his sister, Deb.  This season of Dexter was a successful return to form, Dexter is back doing what he does best and this time he has a prodigy.  Jimmy Smits was an excellent addition to this season and I really dug his character.
0441008615|3.0|This was my first experience with Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, although I'd heard plenty about both.  It was, for the most part, a pretty positive one, although they aren't authors I'd immediately go rush out to get their other books.  I was pretty reluctant to read this.  I don't know, it feels...blasphemous in a way, even after reading it.  I don't exactly regret reading it, but I do think that it needs to be taken lightly.  The book itself was well-paced, with interesting writing that kept me wanting to read more.  My favorite characters were Aziraphale and Crowley, and I definitely loved the banter and chemistry between the two.  Adam was also a pretty fantastic character.  However, I don't know about you, but I got pretty annoyed when about halfway through the book, the characters that I just named lost a lot of screen time, barely appearing at all until the very end.  Huh?  Aren't they the main characters?  I lost a lot of the enthusiasm that kept me hooked at the beginning, because all of the interesting characters had, for some reason, received boring tiny storylines all of a sudden, leaving the readers with too many stories all over the place, not one of them particularly interesting.  It became just another book that tried much too hard to be quirky and by doing so, failed to be quirky.  The reader is left with an unsatisfying, predictable, and anticlimactic ending that really confused me at first, because I couldn't understand why the authors had decided to end it this way.  It could have been a great book, but it unraveled and fell apart, and I'm very sad that I had to witness such a great story falling apart.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5
B00260HH3K|5.0|you cant trust the reveiws for this movie theres a group on youtube that has about 1000 subscribers and they are promoting that all their veiwers go to this site and give it one star reveiws a lot of the ppl didnt even see it there just making acounts and saying that its the worst movie ever.    the movie was really good and fun to watch it just has so manny negitive reveiws because these fanboys got pissed that it wasnt 100% like the comic book. so most of these reveiw are wrongfully written its a good movie i recomend it
0790729342|5.0|Wandering through the blasted interior of post-apocalyptic, gas-starved Australia in his battered Interceptor, Max (Mel Gibson) encounters a community centered around a working oil derrick and besieged by savage outlaws who want their fuel.  Events culminate in one of the greatest chases ever committed to film.    Director George Miller made this classic action film with great economy.  Characters such as the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) and the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) are established quickly and efficiently, gaining our instant sympathy.  There are also plenty of unexpected laughs and some genuinely moving moments.  \\"The Road Warrior\\" is a perfect example of a cast and crew who kept their eye on the goal--non-stop thrills and excitement--but saw that as no impediment to delivering a fully rounded, character driven film.  Watch for Farscape's Virginia Hey in an early role as the Warrior Woman.
1572816112|5.0|I have to say this happens to be the best purchase I ever made when it comes to the tarot. I never have gotten such accurate readings utilizing this deck.

0439023483|5.0|(NO MAJOR SPOILERS)    Imagine two dozen gladiators -- brutal killers, merely for the sake of entertainment -- being selected to star in the reality show \\"Survivor.\\" But forget voting your competition off the island, this contest of wit, strength, and endurance isn't over until just one heart is beating. This is The Hunger Games. Or at least this is what The Hunger Games would be at its finest, according to its producers. Instead, a national audience is forced to watch perhaps eight or so of the contestants, who have trained all their lives for this \\"honor,\\" slaughter the other sixteen, who were chosen from a mandatory raffle to be easy prey. Some of them are as young as twelve. None are older than eighteen.    But only after the bloodbath do the Games really begin.     Had I read this introduction on the back of a book, there is no way I would have spent $17 on it. I wouldn't have even bought it with a half-price coupon. But because of so many others telling me the novel would be well worth my time to read, I am now the proud owner of two copies--neither of which is in my home at the moment because I talk the book up so much myself that I have to lend it out to one friend after another. Simply put: The Hunger Games is one of the best novels I've read in several years.    Why, you ask? Brilliant plot, excellent writing, and a clever, highly-likable protagonist. And for you fans of a good romance . . . when one will eventually have to take the other's life, think of the complications. This definitely isn't your typical love story, but it's a great one.    The target audience is young adult (ages 12-18), and I think a good majority of twelve year olds are mature enough to read it. But I would encourage a parent to read it first before their child that young picks it up. You'll likely enjoy the read yourself even if you decide your child should wait a year of two longer. However, I don't think many younger than fifteen or so will really see the depth of the story -- the subtle hints woven into it about how savage our entertainment tastes have become, and where they may end up if our humanity isn't kept in check. The author never says this, but the message is clear on nearly every page.    As far as content for younger readers, there isn't a single curse word in the entire book. Not one. In my opinion, that is the mark of a really competent writer. Even in life and death situations, Collins doesn't lean on easy crutches to portray the emotions of her characters. And I don't want to give too much away about the romance, but there wasn't a single line in the most intimate of scenes that I wouldn't let my own twelve-year-old read. The violence is definitely there, but gore is kept to a minimum. Remember what The Hunger Games is all about, however, because the rules are real: kill or be killed. And children do indeed die. I think it's fair to relate the violence level to that of the last three books in the Harry Potter series. But there are fewer emotional strings attached to most who die in The Hunger Games, so it isn't quite as traumatic.    Honestly, compared to the shocking material I often find in novels written for an audience as young as twelve, questionable content in The Hunger Games is really quite mild. I recommend it for just about anyone in the target audience range, and the novel is easily sophisticated enough for most adults. In fact, I rarely read books even half as riveting off the adult shelves.
0595440096|5.0|My mother is probably in her 10th year of Alzheimer's disease.  We watched her life gradually depleting by something we could not grasp nor we could fight against.  \\"Still Alice\\" helped me to put some of the 2's and 2's together.  For instance, why my mother lost her identity of our mother, why she often fell, why she talked to \\"herself\\"(another person really) in the mirrow, why she lose her command of words....  Now I have two hopes:<br /><br />1) Make \\"Still Alice\\" into a movie so AD can be introduced to the public who are struggling with it for their loved ones, and who are yet to face the threat.<br /><br />2) An even more \\"detailed\\" progress of the disease can be written in a story form as well, so that both early stage patients and their future caregiver have some idea what's laid in the future for them.<br /><br />The best help the author provided is that she chose the format of a \\"novel\\" to explain what AD is.  Though being a scientiest, she did not overwhelm us with terminology and jargon.  She also gave us a \\"reflective\\" section at the end which stired us to ponder on some of the key turning points that Alice experienced and the problems that her family tackled with during the process.  The \\"family discussion and debate\\" is so \\"real\\"(close to the end of the book) it reminded me of what my siblings and I and mom's neurologist have been wrangling with before we have to make any decisions about an incapacitated loved one.<br /><br />Thank you! Dr. Lisa Genova!  God bless you, and thank Him for putting the desire of writing this book in your heart!<br /><br />Bambi
0061767581|1.0|This book was definately written by a ghost writer based on Lauren's actual life. The book has a completely different vibe than Lauren herself. Everyone's personalitycomes thru in their work and this is not her work by far.    Even on the show if anyone used a word that was not vernacular she would say,\\" why aere you using that word\\" to her friend Lo.    She probably met with the writer and said- let's make the book about a reality tv star- here are some facts that happened-these are the things I had to deal with and did not like; etc.    She does not have the writing skills to write this book- it was written by an experienced writer-ghost writer.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I grew up with this album and just recently got it on CD.  My favorite song is \\"Where Will the Children Play?\\", very appropriate for the times we live in.    In fact, I believe this song made a huge impact on me and my siblings, as three of the four of us are heavily involved in environmental businesses for the past 20 years.    You absolutely cannot go wrong with buying this CD.

B0028KGD8I|5.0|This show has me hooked!  I rented season 1 & 2 and had no choice but to download season 3 at $1.99/episode.  Worth every penny!  You see Dexter start to transform from an isolated but mainstreamed sociopath into a husband and father.  Dexter toys with the notion of having a \\"friend\\" and the trust it encompasses.  I can't wait for Season 4.  Just when you think Dexter is going to get caught, he doesn't - in a weird and twisted chain of events, he doesn't.  Almost like devine intervention (or a creative writing team).
1594201927|4.0|The author of this book is on the right track a number of times throughout the book.Unfortunately,he consistently gets sidetracked and never really sends a clear  message about what the fundamental problem is.The fundamental problem is banker financed and/or directed speculation.This goes under many different terms,such as \\" securitization \\" ,\\" financial innovation\\",\\" financial hedging\\",\\" financial services \\", etc.The goal is always to make money without any actual production of a good or service.Banker financed and directed speculation leads to the creation of a bubble.This leads to a mania,which leads to a panic,which leads to a crash,which leads to an economic downturn, recession or depression.This pattern  has been repeating itself again and again over the last 400 or so years.       The ultimate question is \\" Who gets the money from the banks \\"? One can set up a central bank with a clearcut policy aim of preventing the banks from making loans to speculators in the first place.This policy was intuitively understood by the ancient Hebrew prophets,Jesus,Aristotle ,Plato,Augustine,Aquinas,Smith,and Keynes.However,only Keynes provided a structured, formal, theoretical,mathematical analysis demonstrating how this process of  a speculative demand for money,operating in an economy determined by shifting and changing expectations of the future,where decision makers were subject to uncertainty,ambiguity,and ignorance,would lead  periodically to  severe ,   recurring financial  crises .      The author of the book spends far,far,too much time on,for example George Soros,whose analytic approach is very similar to Keynes's, although he does not realize this, and Milton Friedman,whose entire corpus of work over some 70 years rests on the claim that decision makers are  only  confronted by linear ,additive  risk,as defined by the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution.There is no such thing as uncertainty,ambiguity,vagueness,or ignorance in decision making for Friedman.Friedman uses the word  \\"uncertainty \\" to mean risk.The author needed to spend far more time on Smith and Keynes. I believe that this lacuna could be remedied in a future revised edition.      In conclusion,the more banks lend to speculators or engage in speculation the greater the problems an economy will face.The less the banks lend to speculators the greater will become the wealth of nations and the prosperity of all citizens .

B00005NIE1|5.0|Well i've litterally listened to this album over hundreds of times and it never gets old. I think all the people who gave it one star are just butthurt that their favorite bands are labeled as the saviors of rock. or that they hold the fact julien casablancas used something to digitally inhance his voice or sometihng. Well listen to them live there just as good. He doesnt have the best sining voice like lets say Regina Spektor does, but this is a rock band! You don't need the best voice. In my opinion they lived up to all the hype and compared to the killers whos the most popular rock band right now that the strokes are the savoiors of rock. Don't get me wrong the killers are alright but are they really rock n' roll or just another pop band. Also they bag on them for not being telented enough on the guitar???? They came up with some sick guitar solos and the constant strumming of the same few chords is part of their sound! Go listen to weezer and alot of other bands who are like that they are amazing too. I do agree Last Night is the weakest track though, but most bands release a super catchy song to sell the album to lil girls. Atleast it was just one of the 11 tracks. All in all this album is amazing and a breath of fresh air in this day and age. Get this album for sure. Theres no bands that really that make me think damn saviors of rock except for this band, anything on the label park the van, Fleet Foxes, and the Dead Trees (probally left alot out). The Strokes are on par if not better then any of those.
1402217722|4.0|I guess I've been living under a rock because I feel like I'm one of the only book bloggers who hasn't read a book by Georgette Heyer. I have a few on my shelves, but it wasn't until a few days ago that I finally decided to pick one up and see what all the buzz is about. I chose to read<br />A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big reader of romance books (unless you count the occasional chick lit book) so I wasn't quite sure that I was going to like A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE. I just figured that I should try one of these Heyer books that everyone seems to be talking about. When I read the book description, I have to admit that I was skeptical -- it really didn't sound like a book that would appeal to me. I couldn't have been more wrong. A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE was just a wonderful book.<br /><br />I thought the storyline in this novel was extremely creative. Horatia, the youngest sister in Winwood family offers herself in marriage to the Earl of Rule to allow her older sister to marry her true love. She and the Earl agree to have a marriage of convenience, and Horatia does her best to be a good wife; however, she still finds herself in some uncomfortable situations. While Horatia does seem to appreciate her husband, she fails to realize his genuine feelings towards her. It takes awhile for them to \\"get on the same page,\\" and the confusion and adventures that occur along the way are just incredibly entertaining.<br /><br />I couldn't help but like Horatia, although I did get frustrated with her actions and sometimes wanted to shake her. She was such a unique girl/woman who wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She did do some rather stupid things, but I kept reminding myself that she was only 17 years old and very naive. In addition, I tried to understand that she was thrown into an entirely new life -- she married an older and very wealthy man whom she really didn't know at all. Nonetheless, Horatia was such an interesting character and I can see why the Earl was enamored by her.<br /><br />Not only did I like Horatia, but I absolutely loved the Earl. He was such a wonderful male character. I found him to be smart, charming, witty, and best of all patient with Horatia. Time and time again, he saved Horatia from her own careless actions and always seemed to forgive her. It was almost as if he could read her mind and anticipate her next move. I just thought he was such a romantic man.<br /><br />Of course, I was rooting for Horatia and the Earl to realize not only their own feelings, but also each other's feelings. There were many twists and turns and zany mishaps along the way, but I felt very satisfied with the ending of this book. I was happy to see that the married couple \\"lived happily ever after.\\" I'm starting to think that I appreciate romance stories more than I thought!<br /><br />While I was a little surprised by how much I enjoyed this story, I was absolutely blown away by how much humor was in this story. For some crazy reason, I wasn't expecting this book to be so funny -- I guess I thought a romance set in Regency England would be \\"stuffy.\\" I was just incredibly wrong. This book was a hoot! The characters (especially Horatia's brother) and their escapades were extremely funny, and I found myself laughing a great deal.<br /><br />After reading A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE, I definitely will be recommending it to many of my friends; and I certainly want to read more of Ms. Heyer's books. I am so glad that I have a few more of her novels on my bookshelves. She has written something like 56 books over a 53 year period (that's pretty incredible to me); and her books include romances, historical fiction and even mysteries. According to the Sourcebooks website, she is supposedly known for her \\"research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations.\\" Based on this one novel, I agree; and I am definitely looking forward to reading some ofher historical fiction novels in the near future.

B001VLBDD0|4.0|Perhaps one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of the 20th Century, this action film is of a rare breed: a solid plot, suspenseful, and one of the most quoted films of the last 20 years. Even though the film has been out for a long time, Stan Winston's special effects have withstood the test of time. The film looks as good, if not better than anything done today. The Governator reprises his role as \\"The Terminator\\", sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), an instrumental key in the war against skynet, from the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). This film delivers on many levels and is worth buying for repeat viewing.
0743290127|1.0|I really enjoyed Prada and read lots of Chick Lit.  I ignored the bad reviews here, with the notion that when reading ChickLit, I want something light, entertaining, and character development just isn't as crucial, IMO.  The title turned me off a bit, as a hate the notion that women must \\"chase\\" after an engagement ring, but the strength of Prada made me look forward to reading this book.    What a mistake.  The characters were shallow and unlikeable.  The plot was so thin, and the supposed \\"friendship\\" between them was miserable.  I didn't bother finishing this book - which is very unusual for me.
0439023483|5.0|There has been so much hype around THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins that I knew I had to read it -- everyone seems to be raving about it! I have to admit that it's not a book that I probably would have picked up prior to associating with some many book bloggers because 1) it's YA and that's just not a genre I read much of, and 2) it's technically science fiction and that's not a genre I usually read either. However, since everyone is so excited about this book, I decided to check it out of my library and see what all the fuss was about. I was more than a little concerned that it couldn't possibly live up to everyone's praise, but guess what? It did -- I absolutely loved this book!<br /><br />I knew I was in trouble when I started this book on Mother's Day. I probably should have been spending some quality time with my family, but I had to read THE HUNGER GAMES. I simply could not put this book down. And, it's not one of those books that takes awhile to get into -- no sir, from the very first page, I was hooked! I became so caught up in this action-packed, fact-paced novel that I had to keep reading to find out what happened.<br /><br />The plot of this book is just an amazing story -- 24 kids fighting to their deaths until there is only one remaining. What makes this story is more insane is that the event is \\"televised\\" to all the citizens of Panem -- it is a reality show that knows no bounds. While parts of the story seemed a bit like the Olympics, especially the pageantry of the opening cermonies and the special interest stories, other parts were more like the ultimate Survivor show (only this time it was a case of life and death.) From just a plot standpoint, this book was fascinating and there was never a dull moment.<br /><br />However, there were so many more great things about this novel than just the storyline. I loved how the author developed the characters, especially sixteen year old Katniss. When the story begins, Katniss came across to me as very harsh and bitter -- of course, her father died in a mine explosion, her mother basically shut down, and she was responsible for taking care of and feeding her little sister so I guess she had a right to be a little angst-ridden. I appreciated that the author allowed us to see a gentler side of Katniss when she was out hunting in the woods and talking with her friend Gale. I also saw signs of Katniss' more compassionate side when she sacrificed herself for an almost certain death rather then letting her younger sister compete in The Hunger Games. Had I not seen this caring side of Katniss, I'm not sure I would have felt such an affinity to Katniss.<br /><br />I absolutely loved how Katniss matured throughout the course of this novel. I can imagine that fighting for your life would make you grow up quickly. Katniss was a pretty real character for me -- a teenager who at times thought and acted like an adult, and other times who was absolutely clueless. I appreciated how she learned not only to trust her own instincts, but eventually learned how to trust others. I also liked how she came to really understand herself and her strengths (and even her weaknesses); and, I definitely think she showed signs of being a \\"normal\\" teenager when it comes to her confusion about boys!<br /><br />In addition to developing the character of Katniss, I thought the author did an amazing job with showing human characteristics -- both good and bad -- in all of the other characters in the book. She created characters who had very real and honest feelings such as compassion and hope, but also greed and anger. I can only imagine how fighting for your life can bring out the best and worst of human behavior.<br /><br />Another thing I really liked was how Ms. Collins wove so much insight into individuals and society into this novel. She did a great job of showing how discrimination and bias exists among people, and how the upper classes can take advantage of their situation in life. I also appreciated how she showed the effects that war has on a society especially when it comes to the children. Those are just a few examples of the thought-provoking themes that run through this book.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is the first in a series, and I can't wait for Book 2 CATCHING FIRE which will be available on September 1st. When I finished this book, there were quite a few loose ends which I'm sure will be addressed in the next novel. And while Katniss did grow up a lot throughout the course of this book, I'm anxious to see what happens to her when she goes back home. She has some unresolved issues from her relationships, and I'm curious to see how she handles them.<br /><br />There is a very cool website devoted to THE HUNGER GAMES. Even though the site is not geared towards me, I had a lot of fun playing around on it! There are downloadable games, excerpts from the book, and even a message board so you can discuss the story with others.<br /><br />The only thing that disappointed me about this book is that my daughter is too young to read it. There is some violence and cruelty that might upset younger readers and probably would disturb her. It's not that she couldn't read it, but I think to fully appreciate the book, she should wait a few years. Plus, I'm not really ready to answer some of her questions that are sure to pop up.<br /><br />I definitely recommend THE HUNGER GAMES to every teen (boys and girls alike) because I'm sure they will love it as much as I do; but I also think adults will appreciate the story for some different reasons. I think this novel would make an excellent discussion book for a teen book club or even a mother daughter book club; and I firmly intend to have our girls read it in a few years.

0802798225|5.0|\\"Nothing is what it seems\\"  This book is incredible, and I reccomend anyone and everyone to read it. I'm a big reader, and have read a lot of books, and its huge for me to be so passionate about one like I am with this. You will be sucked in from page one, and will not want to stop until the end. Even then, you will crave more. The cover picture could not describe this book any better. It's incredible. Read this book, it will stay with you forever. It has changed my views of many things. Changed my life.
0307346617|5.0|It's hard not to laud too much praise upon Max Brooks for his wonderful delve into Zombie fiction, \\"World War Z\\".  This book is by turns suspenseful, thoughtful, hyper-kinetic, satirical, profoundly intelligent, and terrifying- but from cover to blood-drenched cover it is always entertaining.  Brooks practically reinvents the Zombie genre and offers up Romero's creatures for a new generation of walking dead enthusiasts.  Told from the perspective of a UN fact finder years after the apocalyptic Zombie War, Brooks offers multiple stories for the horrific battle between mankind and the dead.  From under the sea to the International Space Station, from the plains of North America to the sewers of Paris, from the frozen steppes of Russia to the safe zone of Hawaii, Brooks gives us one hell of a ride.  Highly recommended!
0679745203|4.0|This month, my on-line book club decided to read THE ENGLISH PATIENT by Michael Ondaatje. I was really looking forward to reading it since this book has been sitting on my bookshelves for over 10 years. I admit that I had high expectations since I knew this book had won the Man Booker Prize, and many people think say it's one of their favorites. After finishing this novel, I can definitely say that I'm glad I read it; but I don't think it goes down as one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />I feel like something might be wrong with me because I didn't love this book. I kept asking myself what was wrong with me -- what was I missing? I did feel a little better when I found some others on Twitter who agreed with me that the book was a little hard to get into. I think I had problems connecting to the characters; and I even wonder if the writing style kept me from<br />actually becoming absorbed in the story. (plus, I just felt it read very slowly.) The author also backed into the story, and it wasn't until the end of the book where everything came together -- I found myself a little confused at times.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this book, it wasn't until the second half that I really understood what all of the praise was about. Don't get me wrong - from the first paragraph, I knew the writing was something very special. Mr. Ondaatje's descriptions are just incredible, and I could almost \\"see\\" the villa and the characters. My problem was that I just didn't love the story or the characters. It wasn't like I wanted to quit reading -- it was more like I just wasn't dying to go back to the book after I put it down. However, I can honestly say that I am very glad I kept with it because THE ENGLISH PATIENT was a beautiful and deeply touching story.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I did feel a connection with the characters especially Hana and Kip. They both were so young and had seen and experienced so much pain in their lives. I was glad that they found some comfort in each other, and I think their relationship helped them both to heal. I thought the author did an amazing job of developing both of their characters and allowing the reader to actually \\"feel\\" the devastating effects that the war had on each of them. I also enjoyed that I saw a glimpse (albeit brief) of them in the future.<br /><br />One thing that I really appreciated about this book (besides the lyrical writing) was how everything came together in the end. At times, I wasn't too sure where the novel was going and how everything was going to work out; but I have to say that I thought it was brilliant how the story lines were all tied up. I loved how the author interwove the characters' pasts; and I definitely was surprised with a few of the associations -- parts of this story were almost a mystery.<br /><br />THE ENGLISH PATIENT was a difficult book for me to read because so much of the story was incredibly sad. Naturally a book about the effects of a war is going to be depressing, but I liked that the book was also about love. There were actually two love stories woven into this novel that showed that even in hard times, the love of another can help someone cope. I truly appreciated that the love stories and relationships were very honest and not at all overdone.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed how much this book made me think. Not only did I find myself thinking about each of the characters, but I also like that the author showed that people and events aren't always what they appear to be at first glance. Once you spend the time to really learn about a person, you can discover so much more about them and even appreciate their differences. There were quite a few powerful messages in this novel. One that I walked away with is that \\"life is not black and white, but rather many shades of grey.\\"<br /><br />There is a terrific reading guide which I hope we'll use to start some of our discussion. I read over the questions and they really do give the reader a lot to thinkabout. I think it's going to not only be interesting to hear whether everyone enjoyed the book, but also to learn what they think about the characters and their actions. There are also so many deep themes to discuss such as Hana's relationship with all three men (as well as her father) and the effects the war had on each character.whether everyone enjoyed the book, but also to learn what they think about the characters and their actions.

1423101472|5.0|This review is from my 12 year old daughter:      Very realistic for a fantasy book ;)... I really felt like I was there with Percy!  Has a good sense of comedy mixed with the war themes.  A bit frightening for a reader 7 or younger, but educational for the who's who of Greek Mythology.  I thoroughly recommend this book!
B0023RSZLY|4.0|David Halberstam's final work, \\"The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War\\" is a fine account of the first shooting war within the Cold War.  Halberstam's book succeeds on many levels.  Personal accounts of battle and military life by American soldiers add a credibility to this story which does not always fall strictly into the genre of military history.  Indeed this work examines the minute political and diplomatic dances of not only the United States, but also the Soviet Union, China, and the two Koreas.  Cold Warrior personalities such as Dean Aacheson and George Kennan are examined every bit as much as Generals Douglas MacArthur and Matt Ridgeway.<br /><br />Halberstam is never subtle when it comes to MacArthur.  If you are firmly in the general's camp in the ongoing debate you will not be pleased with this narrative.  If, however, you believe MacArthur was negligent, irresponsible, and insubordinate, you will greatly appreciate the author's research and delivery.  Halberstam's examination of the Chinese general Peng, as well as his look into the actions of Stalin and Mao make this a truly international history, and it is all the richer for it.<br /><br />As a military history it is only a partial success.  While the first hand accounts of battle are well written and informative, there seems to be far too much emphasis upon tactical engagements and, of course, the political/strategic concerns.  The operational aspects of the war are often only quickly mentioned, and then within the larger context of bickering generals and how they fit into MacArthur's web of intrigue.  Also, this work really only focuses upon the dramatic first six to nine months of the war, only noting the static war of the next two years briefly.<br /><br />With only minor faults, this is a first-rate work that generally succeeds in mixing military, political, and diplomatic history.  It's too bad we won't be getting any more books like this from Halberstam, and we can only be grateful that after forty years of kicking it around he finally wrote it.of kicking it around he finally wrote it.

B001NXDSLQ|5.0|If you're a certain age, the word &#34;Woodstock&#34; conjures far more than a place in Ulster County, New York.  Advertised as &#34;The Woodstock Festival of Music and Art,&#34; the monumental event was held from August 15 to 18, 1969, on land belonging to local farmer Max Yasgur.  Many of the era's most popular rock groups and solo performers were signed at huge fees to make the event the biggest rock concert ever held in the United States.  &#34;Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music: The Director's Cut -- 40th Anniversary Edition&#34;  is reissued on DVD and new to Blu-ray and features the Michael Wadleigh-directed documentary that captures not only the music, but the cultural phenomenon that would become legendary.  Designed to hopefully attract 50,000 people, Woodstock eventually drew 500,000, mostly young, who came by car, truck, helicopter, or on foot.  Rolling Stone Magazine called the festival one of the &#34;50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock `n' Roll.&#34;  Artists included Country Joe McDonald, Santana, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Grateful Dead, Joan Baez, The Band, Janis Joplin, Richie Havens, John Sebastian, and Sly and the Family Stone.  Performance highlights of the three-disc set include Jimi Hendix's &#34;Star Spangled Banner;&#34; Richie Havens' &#34;Freedom;&#34; Sly & the Family Stone's medley of &#34;Dance to the Music,&#34; &#34;Music Lover,&#34; and &#34;I Want to Take You Higher;&#34; and Ten Years After's &#34;I'm Going Home.&#34;   The appeal of the movie is twofold.  As a concert film, it showcases top acts of the era, many at the peak of their popularity.  But it also works as a chronicle of a once-in-a-lifetime happening, as Wadleigh shows us the concertgoers reveling in the atmosphere, excited by the music, making the best of things when rain comes, and even coping with inadequate sanitation facilities.  Their youthful exuberance is captured in the smiling faces, flowered shirts, love beads, long hair and occasional nudity that would scandalize nearby residents.  &#34;Woodstock&#34; had an uninspired DVD release in 1997 that disappointed many rock fans and lovers of the movie.  That has been righted with this set, which features 18 never-before-seen-on-film performances, including &#34;One Day at a Time&#34; (Joan Baez), &#34;Flying High&#34; (Country Joe McDonald), &#34;On the Road Again&#34; (Canned Heat), &#34;Born on the Bayou&#34; (Creedence Clearwater Revival), &#34;Mean Town Blues&#34; (Johnny Winter), and &#34;Teen Angel&#34; (Sha Na Na).  Also included is &#34;Woodstock: From Festival to Feature,&#34; a featurette containing interviews with original concertgoers, promoters, crew, and musicians, and a Hugh Hefner interview with director Michael Wadleigh from the 1970's TV show &#34;Playboy After Dark.&#34;  Purists might complain about the remastered soundtrack, but if you recall the record album, the sound was far from perfect. The sound on the discs has been cleaned up and is sharper.  The film was shot with a number of different cameras, resulting in differing aspect ratios, but, happily, the 40th Anniversary Edition is uniformly widescreen.  Also available is an Ultimate Collector's Edition, with fringed deluxe packaging, containing the material listed above as well as a retrospective featurette, &#34;The Museum at Bethel Woods: The Story of the Sixties and Woodstock,&#34; a 60-page Life Magazine reprint, a Woodstock patch, and a reprint of a concert ticket.
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|The Proposal is my favorite movie this summer. The storyline is similar to Sandra Bullock's While You Were Sleeping, so one should release the notion of wanting to see something not yet done. If you can do this, you'll find that it is a lovely film, filled with the kind of sweetness and humor that we have come to know and love from Sandra Bullock. Ryan Reynolds plays a wonderful \\"straight man\\" to Sandra's zany, and the support cast is wonderful. In particular, Betty White and Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez. Both lend several laugh out loud moments. All in all, this is a feel good film definitely worth owning.
1573300403|5.0|I bought both this and his History dvd (greatest hits on dvd).<br /><br />If you are looking for incredible value this is probably the best way to get a pretty complete collection.  If you must only get one though, get History Volume 2.  It's about 20 minutes longer, and has many more tracks.<br /><br />Here's why:  Not only does it have the staples you would expect such as Thriller (full length), Beat it, Smooth Criminal.<br /><br />If you're like me, watching Thriller definitely brought back the great memories of the first time I saw it, maybe 25 years, who I was with, how much we were wowed.  It's funny how you can remember something just before you reexperience it.<br /><br />It also has the live version of Billie Jean at the Motown 25 celebration in 1993, when he debuted the moonwalk.  Definitely, one of Michael's best performances, in my opinion probably the best.  That makes this a must own for that reason alone.<br /><br />It also contains the 1995 MTV live performance, of Black or White with Slash going crazy with his guitar solo. You wonder if it's part of the act, or if he is genuinely possessed.<br /><br />Scream with Janet, not a particular fan of the song, but love the video. Janet brings the attitude, an amazing video really.<br /><br />You are not alone: with Lisa Marie Presley.  She brings the sexy and sensual in a very artful way, absolutely stunning. I have never seen Lisa Marie this way before. Hmmm..  In this video, Michael goes from being with her, to portraying an asexual angel half clad almost waist deep in water.  Perhaps Freud or Jung might be able to shed some light on this.<br /><br />Childhood. A Peter Pan type ballad with children passing by overhead in a boat, no doubt a repesentation of his childhood passing by.  Have you seen my childhood...<br /><br />Earthsong.  Quite a spectacular movie filmed over several continents.  Obviously, Michael was very serious about respecting life on the planet, and shows images of restoring life. Outstanding.<br /><br />Blood on the Dance Floor.  I can't explain why I like this so much.  It's totally new to me, has a great vibe, and I just love it.<br /><br />There is also a starstudded Hollywood video.  I was surprised to see both John Travolta, and Olivia Newton John among many others.<br /><br />Now, if you are considering getting the first dvd as well, there is a little duplication.  It also has Thriller, and Beat it.  Billie Jean is the video version, so not a duplication.<br /><br />Highlights of that dvd include: Bad, the 18 minute version directed by Martin Scorsese, The Pharaoh video with Eddie Murphy, Imam, and Magic Johnson, Black or White with the infamous Panther Dance, The Way you make me feel with the model and the car, and the destruction sequence at the end. That dvd is about 20 minutes shorter.<br /><br />If you are like me and you cannot decide which one to get, get both. Because I don't think you can get such a comprehensive collection any other way, and I find it to be incredible to get most of the best videos of probably the greatest entertainer who definitely made the best videos at this price. I certainly will be checking out Lisa Marie again.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.so much.  It's totally new to me, has a great vibe, and I just love it.

I skipped a couple parts in the book because I just found them too boring and I just wasn't interested.  I see lots of 5 star reviews so Im guessing people who love fossils and rocks really like this book.  If you dont then this is not the book for you.
0385341008|5.0|Loved this book!  I've read dozens of book in the past month and this has been one of my favorites.  Because of the format of the book (a collection of letters), the book is easy to read when you just have a few spare minutes.  The characters are charming, the story is interesting, and the format is novel.  This is a good book to read when you just need a quick pick-me-up.  However, it's also one that could be read again and again because it is so charming and puts a smile on your face.

1439157383|5.0|Bravo, Jodi Picoult!  Bravo, bravo, bravo!<br /><br />MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a delicate story about family, life, love, friendship, decisions and fate.  13 year old Anna, originally conceived to save her sister Kate's life through various invasive donor treatments, has had enough.  To legally emancipate herself, she hires Attorney Campbell to help guide her through the courts.<br /><br />This tale is told from several perspectives, including the family members, the attorney and the court-appointed guardian ad litem, from the very beginning to the shocking finale.  And I do mean shocking!<br /><br />I left this book feeling thankful - thankful to be alive, thankful for my famiy and friends, and thankful to understand all the perspectives Ms. Picoult masterfully described.<br /><br />An attorney myself, I always say that it is important not to jump to conclusions when listening to others' perspectives.  You never know what others are dealing with.  And this story makes you understand just why we must slow down, take a breath, and listen to others.<br /><br />Well done, Ms. Picoult!  I look forward to reading more of your work!<br /><br />J.R. Reardon<br />author, CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I was personally intrigued to watch this movie, having myself gone through recently having a friend who revealed that he wanted to become a woman. His fears were lived in not knowing how any of his friends would accept him during this process. He was my roommate, and so i lived with him as he went on this journey. It was a challenge for me to personally understand and attempt to lovingly encourage some of the changes he wanted to make.  All of my own fears, hesitations, problems with people's hatred towards the transgender community were addressed in this film. Felicity Hauffman, was convincing in this role, and the young guy who plays her son... powerful, sometimes disturbing yet beautiful acting.   This movie is not for the faint of heart. There is some scenes of graphic nudity, graphic language that depicts sexual abuse, and it holds few bars on being polite about the realistic emotional journey of the family going through life with a transgender person. That said, there is a beauty...a maturity... that resonates thru the film that tells a story, and gives a timeless message. Love, in its truest form, has no conditions. I highly recommend this film for all that would open their hearts and minds, set aside their issue with this subject, and see a very honest point of view they may not share, but at the end of the day maybe come to peace with.

I'm slightly infatuated with MJ after watching him non-stop for two hours!!  And I'm also sad because he's now gone and will never be able to be on top like he was during this time in his career.  He does do some lip-syncing during the concert, mainly for songs that he does a lot of dancing to.  I don't understand why he sang along with himself on songs such as Heal The World and Man In The Mirror because he didn't dance during these...  he could have sung live.  The most impressive song of all is Working Day and Night.  He sings LIVE, never stops moving, and does about five encores because he's \\"not ready\\" to end the song, he says.. It's an absolute blast to watch.   The only disappointing aspect of the DVD comes at the very end when, during the \\"stunt,\\" it's not him during take-off.... and the set-up, as other have commented on, is way too long -- especially when it's not even him blasting off.    No matter what went on in the mind and life of this incredible entertainer, that's not our business or judgement to make.  He was a musical genius and innovator, and he will be terribly missed.  There is no doubt that in EVERY aspect of his life, he ENTERTAINED.  But he entertained most on stage, doing what he loved to do.  The joy of entertaining showed in his face when he was introducing his band members, how he was appreciative of the musicians, and it is obvious that they loved him as well.  Buy the DVD so that you can see The Man in his prime, doing what he does best.  He's magical.
B0000067L3|3.0|cream,s wheels of fire although great in some spots is kind of a mixed bag.wheels of fire was released in 1968 and once again the cover art was very cool.by the time cream began recording this the band was on the fast track for a break up and by early 1969 they did.the best of it is;white room,desrted cities of the heart,those were the days,sitting on top of the world and crossroads from disc 2of a double album and disc 2 was live recordings.all in all this is very worthwhile double cd as it was cream,s last real effort in the studio and does contain some really fine tunes!! get it!!

If one follows the recommendations in the book, it should result in less cancer, less heart trouble, less obesity, and less diabetes.  This is an incredibly informative book and deserves a wide audience of readers.

B001PR0Y5S|1.0|Being that I love Ryan Reynolds, and enjoy Sandra Bullock, I assumed that this film, although perhaps trite, would be one I enjoyed. Sadly, this was a gross miscalculation. The jokes (if you want to call them that) at the most registered a smile, although usually just prompted a look of disdain towards scripting that seemed elementary. Often throughout the roughly two hour time frame, the movie attempted physical humor and large scenes of chaos-I can only assume the writers were trying to conger a 'meet the parents' type feel-for me, these moments felt pushed, awkward, and painful to sit through. Perhaps I disliked this film so much because I had just seen 'the hangover' and 'i love you man'-both of which i loved. Whatever the reason, I would definitely pass on seeing this movie again, and am finding myself wishing i would have the first time.
B001IYCMNA|4.0|I just installed 2 WAP4410's on a Linksys RVS4000 router and brought them up in a basic configuration just to get the system running. I will be tuning the configuration over the next few weeks and will report the results.    Right out of the box, the units worked as advertised with zero hassle. I updated the firmware, changed the admin password, assigned both static IP addresses and resolved the host name to enable roaming which has worked well thus far. I initially enabled SSID broadcast to make it easier to find for setup, but I will eventually disable. So far (anecdotal) the speed seems good, and the APs have had no issues with a mix of a/b/g/n devices. I have no plans to enable PoE, as there are known issues with the link speed dropping to 100mb/s. So far, so good.    It has now been a month, and I have enabled a second guest SSID and have configured links with a number different devices (WGA600n gaming adapter for an Xbox360, WET610N for printer with no hassle at all). The performance and range have been excellent. No problems with the VLAN or the QoS functions for streaming.    In the final analysis; a little pricey but an excellent product. 5 Stars.
0312370849|5.0|Although I seldom find a book I can't put down, this is one that captivated me from the first page.  The gist of the novel has been expounded many times, so I just want to say this is a wonderful book.  I cannot recommend it too highly.  If the writing is not prize-worthy and some of the outcomes are pretty easy to figure out, it is still worth every minute you spend with it.  I loved this book!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Ah, but it also has a lot of intelligence behind it.  This is not the usual mindless violence and sex we see far too much of.  The writers of this series imbue the characters with so much life (including the dead ones!)that every single one of them is interesting and watchable.  There is some great dialogue, as well as very believable makeup and special effects.  The Louisiana locations are also marvelous.    You can't help but sympathize with Sookie, whose gift of being able to hear others' thoughts is a blessing and a curse. She has a goofy, hapless brother, Jason, who manages to be appealing even during his worst moments; an adorable grandmother; a sharp-tongued friend, Tara (the impeccable and hilarious Rutina Wesley), whose mother is a drunk and a liability; a boyfriend, Sam, who is a vampire with a conscience that is rare among his kind; and a town filled with people who are mostly hostile towards Sookie because of her relationship with a vampire.    It's also fascinating to see those who are for or against vampire rights; it's a clear metaphor for the ongoing gay rights battle.       Put down the Twilight books and the silly movie and go get True Blood now!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|As a longtime Clint Eastwood fan, I've watched this movie numerous times since I bought it, and it's astonishing that a man almost 80 years old can make a movie THIS good.<br /><br />I know people not even 50 years old laid up sick on dialysis, and Eastwood not only made a movie of this depth and direction, but also STARRED in it, which is amazing to me.<br /><br />No person in film history has starred and directed themselves in as many movies as he has.<br /><br />He's one of a kind.<br /><br />Having said that, unless they plan on bringing out another edition of the movie, the special features were lacking.<br /><br />Just a couple of features about cars.<br /><br />Strange, when you consider that the car is only peripheral to the real plot of the movie.<br /><br />Virtually nothing on the origins of the project, and how the film came to fruition. No behind the scenes visions as the film was being made. Not even the movie trailer is included.<br /><br />But, my five stars are for the the film ITSELF, which is a testament to Eastwood's indelible career.<br /><br />It's a travesty that this movie not only didn't WIN any major awards, it virtually wasn't even nominated for ANYTHING.<br /><br />One nomination from the Golden Globes and NOTHING from the Academy.<br /><br />Ridiculous.

0199559805|5.0|AND SAD BUT FASCINATING READING FOR US ALL<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Few books are more aptly named than the Counter-Terrorism Handbook- unique, but what it is fighting is unique in its own way with modern technology.<br /><br />Small enough (almost) for your pocket, and encased appropriately within , sturdy plastic covers, it delivers over 700 pages packed with clear, pertinent and rigorously researched information and guidance on this vexed subject, which has emerged as one of the most serious threats to life and limb in a free society.<br /><br />Designed to provide all police practitioners with an operational guide to anti-terrorism legislation, this is the first volume of its kind aimed specifically at the police and their counter-terrorism training needs, and very much in the style of military notepads officer cadets (like me) used more years ago than one cares to remember when state resources were more limited, but rather more straightforward in both combat intelligence and physical security policing.<br /><br />The Handbook contains chapters on the counter-terrorism operational framework, national structures and strategies and the role and functions of key agencies.  The legislative section is compiled by the Police National Legal Database (PNLD) and focuses on police powers, procedures and terrorism offences.  When we met the authors at the launch, the usp emphasis of the Handbook rests with the excellent `points to note' and case studies which give that blend of field support which is clearly so well needed to police this area of crime today.<br /><br />Lord Carlile, who, in 2001, became \\"Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation\\", explains in the Foreword that the highly experienced authors of this excellent book have drawn together the body of counter-terrorism legislation in a form accessible to all stakeholders.<br /><br />This Handbook which he describes as being designed for police officers will undoubtedly attract attention and interest from a much wider readership, including Ministers, civil servants and lawyers and all aspects of the security services.  Carlile draws particular attention to the extensive use of case studies, the 'what-really-happened-when' challenge of  the terrorism landscape and as such, an invaluable and certainly crystal clear training resource for specialist and non-specialist officers alike.<br /><br />Lord Berriew's particular concern, however, is one which we suggest the majority of the British public share and wholeheartedly endorse when he says that terrorism law should be used only for terrorism purposes- how right he is and we know where it hasn't followed this road.  He continues, saying that every step outside those purposes provides terrorists with an argument.  All in authority are required never to forget that such laws are a step outside the norms of criminal justice legislation.<br /><br />Such expedients as stop and search...cordoning off specific areas...accessing details of a bank account and so forth, should be used with the utmost caution.  Misused or abused, they and similar measures can escalate into serious infringements of cherished, hard-won freedoms within a democracy.  Consider, for example, the controversial proposal to introduce compulsory ID cards now discarded, which of course, two out of our three mainstream political parties opposed until the government capitulated, generally citing grounds that ID cards, traditionally the tool of the traditional police state, are a major threat to personal freedom and a very minor threat to the determined terrorist.<br /><br />Just to digress a bit, this reminds us of a quote from Benjamin Franklin that appeared in the Times `Letters' page a couple of years ago to the effect that `those who would sacrifice freedom for safety deserve neither freedom nor safety.'  Hmmn - we think Ben was right and, as the problems of terrorism affect us all, we can safely recommend this fascinating and authoritative handbook, not just to the professionals involved, but to the general reader as the ideal resource for modern physical and covert security issues in the modern world.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-0-19-955980-0<br /><br />YouTube<br /><br />[...]ook, not just to the professionals involved, but to the general reader as the ideal resource for modern physical and covert security issues in the modern world.

0553577123|5.0|I had read the book when I was a child an wanted to get a copy for my children to read. I reread it and it prove to have the power entailed in it from  the first time I read it. It is an uplifting tale of a girl who never knew that her writings would capture a historical moment. It speaks of the importance of having family, friends, and strangers to give love and support during our difficult times.Her faith never failed. Her diary was her best friend and her solace during such a horrific and difficult time.<br /><br />This book will be read by my children and will enlighten them and open their minds. It captivates the soul. More importantly, Anne Frank teaches a spiritual lesson of wisdom that goes beyond her years. She has \\"faith, hope and love\\" during uncertain times.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Whitney Houston became a certified boxoffice attraction with \\"The Bodyguard\\", a film about a pop diva being stalked by some psycho and who ultimately needs protection. Enter Kevin Costner. The plot is pretty simple: the two meet, do not like each other at all, and ultimately realize they are falling in love. The movie is well known for it's excellent soundtrack, that has gone on to be the biggest selling movie CD of all-time, even surpassing the 1977 album \\"Saturday Night Fever\\". What really made the film and the album is Whitney Houston's beautiful version of the Dolly Parton masterpiece \\"I Will Always Love You\\", that held on to the #1 position for 14 weeks in 1992-1993.<br /> \\"The Bodyguard\\" was originally suppose to star Diana Ross in the 1970's, and Steve McQueen was rumoured to be her co-star, but the project fell through. In the late 1980's Kevin Costner discovered the project and wanted Whitney Houston in the film. The movie also became a huge boxoffice hit.<br /> For the first time \\"The Bodyguard\\" is now on DVD in widescreen, after originally been available only in full screen. There is a nice music video and a featurette that accompanies the set.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Absolutely Great watching!!!!  Follows the books some but fills in on some of the other characters with a twist or two.  I really recommed this collection.
B000002VMD|5.0|\\"The Bodyguard\\" CD has gone on to be the biggest selling sountrack album from a movie of all-time, selling over 20 million copies alone in the U.S.. Whitney Houston was one of the producers of the project, but it was Kevin Costner who suggested she record the Dolly Parton masterpiece \\"I Will Always Love You\\". Costner had actually loved Linda Ronstant's version of the song and thought Whitney would do wonders with it. David Fostner produced the soundtrack and it would stay at #1 on the Billboard Pop Album Chart for 20 weeks. \\"I Will Always Love You\\" would stay at #1 on the singles charts for 14 weeks and became not only Whitney's signature single but Dolly Parton's biggest money making song that she ever wrote in her career.<br /> Other Whitney songs that are excellent on the album are \\"Run To You\\" and \\"I Have Nothing\\", both of which were nominated for Oscars for Best Song. \\"I Will Always Love You\\" couldn't be nominated for Best Song at that years Academy Awards because it wasn't written for the movie, having being penned by Dolly in 1973.<br /> Other artists who appear on \\"The Bodyguard\\" CD are Lisa Stansfield, a huge pop singer from the early '90's, and Chakka Khann.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|An outstanding flight stick. The ability to adjust the stick's length and fwd/backward slant is great. The buttons on the stick can also be positioned for the most comfortable position. All movements seem crisp and smooth. The Cyborg X has capabilities I haven't explored yet such as the ability to program the buttons. The only curiosity I've found is while flying jets on map CLEAN SWEEP in BF2 the #2 button does not always release bombs cleanly. Sometimes there is a lag between button press and bomb release and other times only one or two bombs out of five will release. But in all fairness I'm not sure that this isn't a function of the game rather than a stick problem. Works great in MS Flight Sim X.     Update: Problem with button#2 became worse and the button finally came apart from the flight stick. Replacement by Amazon was almost immediate. No hassle, no cost. Important note: The stick must be assembled by screwing on to the base. It can be overtightened which caused my POV button to function in only one direction. Loosening resolved the problem.

THE DOORS ARE PROBABLY MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL-TIME,  BUT I WISH I HAD NEVER PURCHASED THESE CDS.       I AM ASHAMED THAT THE DOORS CHOSE TO CAPITALIZE ON  SUCH SUB-PAR PERFORMANCES BY THEIR LEAD VOCALIST.  EVEN  RAY MANZAREK BEGAN SINGING AT CERTAIN POINTS TO TRY AND  BOLSTER MORRISON'S LACKLUSTER VOCALS.       NOT THAT IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE, BUT THE THIRD DISC IS  LESS THAN 30 MINUTES LONG, WITH ONLY 2 SONGS (WITH A DISMAL  AUGMENTED LIGHT MY FIRE) PROPER SHOWING UP.

0393327345|5.0|Amazing. I was dying to read this book for the longest time (since my friend turned me on to Palchunuck and I've seen the movie fight club). It was nothing much short of what I hoped for.  It kept the classic Palchucknuk jumpy feeling to it, which is amazing.  I must warn you, it would probably be better to read the book before watching the movie. While reading, I stopped often to compare the book to the movie, which the movie did follow very well. It left a thing or two out, and changing a thing or two, but over all was pretty well followed. Still, if a reader doesn't like to stop and do such, defiantly read the book first. Though, I'm sure you will be comparing either way.   But nonetheless, another amazing book from palchucknuk. No doubt is it recommended.
0143038583|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone I know. The information is so enlightening you will never be able to look at the world the same way again. Michael Pollan takes an ocean of knowledge and makes it completely understandable, interesting, and at times amusing. I felt more like I was having a conversation with Pollan rather than reading a nonfiction book. I went on to read \\"In Denfese of Food\\", which is an absolute MUST to read as a sequal to \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\"!
0452295548|5.0|Great book.  Very interesting and moving.  Helpful in understanding more about brain function for the non-neurologist, about stroke, how those experiencing one might feel, and especially about rehab.  I wish those running rehab facilities would read it it and be able to redesign facilities and programs so as not to interfere with recovery.  I also wish we all could have someone, or people like the author's mother in our lives.    I read it once and need to read it again.  Also want more depth about the brain, brain injury and recovery, but it is a great introduction.  Hope she writes more.
B000TDFKVW|5.0|While I tend to enjoy B-sides more than A's, this is still a great compilation of some of Enigma's best stuff.<br /><br />What else need be said? It's a must have album for anyone that enjoys electronic-based music.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|There's some very scary moments in this film.  The ending is as freaky as anything I've seen and I've been watching horror films since I was about 8 year old (43 now).  It has a nice uneasiness throughout.  I think everybody can relate to the oddities that sometimes appear in old photos (I have several myself, including one of a pet who had just died) and this film takes good advantage of that.  In fact, if you're like me you'll be looking over your shoulders often after this is over.  It does have a great deal of familiarity to it...at times it looks unpolished, but the effects are mostly quite good.<br /><br />With that said, I have to say I bought this last year and paid too much.  I was disappointed that it wasn't outstanding.  Instead it was good.  I paid for outstanding and didn't get that.  Still, after 2 viewings I feel like I'm over the hurtle and will enjoy it a lot more on my 3rd viewing in about a year.  Still, this doesn't come close to something like the original version of Dark Water.  It seems comfortable beside something like The Eye (original) or The Grudge (only ever seen the remake), however.  I have yet to see Ringu (just bought the anthology to watch in October, however).  Not sure if it compares to that at all.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Okay,so it wasn't the best written.  Hugh Jackman is still fun to watch.  It seems like most of these reviews are from men.  Well from a female perspective, Hugh did fine by me. I hope there is a sequel, because I enjoy the Wolverine character.

B000ICM5MG|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stallone, and this is definitely his best.  You can tell that it was a true labor of love for him, especially when you listen to his commentary.  The characters are very believable (Talia Shire, Sly and Burt Young are amazing), the storyline is great, the music is phenomenal, and the dialogue is great.  I also love the fact that this isn't your typical 'feel good' movie.  It doesn't have the typical perfect ending.  He get's the girl but he still loses the fight.<br /><br />In this edition, the commentaries, particularly Sly's are very informative and fascinating.  He lived and breathed the character for as the whole month it took to shoot.  I could go on and on, but do yourself a favor and just buy it.  You won't regret it!
6304806418|5.0|For years, many actresses exposed an interest in playing the part of Evita. One of the most rediculous was Whitney Houston. Please.  Madonna not only looked quite a bit like Eva Peron, but Madonna's performance in the film almost makes you believe it is Eva.  Superbly photographed, the story is brisk and goes from point A to point B seamlessly. There are no lulls at all. So your interest is not compromised.   The music is well done, and for the most part appropriate, as at times, it is difficult to film a stage play and make it all look plausable.  The price was right, and the quality of the transfer is excellent.  5 stars!

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Pay no attention to anyone knocking these addons, they are the single greatest mod I have had for any controller. They even surpass the infamous G-Grip because they don't require glue.<br /><br />IF cannot get them to stay on, you are either doing it wrong, or not using a DS3 controller.  It's that simple.<br /><br />I use them on all games.  They let me play with only index fingers covering both buttons.  A simple finger slide will tag R2/L2 with little motion.  If for some reason they don't work out for a game, pop'em off and put'em back on later.<br /><br />For games that use the pressure sensitive button they allow you a greater range of motion for finer pressure control.  I like them so much I bought a second set for my second controller so II didn't have to keep swapping.  I'm about to buy a set for my brother.<br /><br />They're that good.<br /><br />Also, these things are dirt cheap.

Namely, that talent is nothing without the hard work that should follow its development or as quoted in the book, \\"Achievement is talent plus preparation.\\" It seems we - the national public - tend to focus on the reward not the work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bleeding heart liberal who's down on the American way of life; far from it. I am however, a guy who loves studying and applying the methods of the successful. And I learned a long time ago that Lady Luck loves hard work; consequently, I believe the harder you work, the luckier you get. In typical Gladwell fashion, Outliers makes an argument that those who rose to unusual levels of success were not only talented, they were in the right place at the right time and (and this is the most important point of the book) they worked harder than anyone else in their field. They didn't just fall into success as so many would have you believe. As it turns out, successful people (Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Yo Yo Ma (super cool name), The Beatles and the list goes on) thrived on a steady diet of hard work. Typically, rigorous and continuous practice sustained over a very long time - in most cases at least 10 years - was the most important element in creating their phenomenal success. Indeed, a refreshing revelation! Because, while it's true that we may not gain the same level of success as the individuals chronicled in the book; (after all, they succeeded to levels outside the normal range of success, thus the title Outliers), with hard work - very hard work - we can all find higher levels of personal and professional achievement. Outliers is an interesting and inspirational read that you won't regret adding to your personal library.

B000OY8NII|5.0|I wrote a longer review for Season 3 DVDs.  Recently caught a couple episodes on SyFy, ordered Season 1 DVDs, then Seasons 2 and 3.      Such a treat to discover a great show when there are already a couple seasons on DVD.  The characters are all engaging, Eureka is a fascinating community and you will go along for the ride.  Eureka, and Lost, are now my favorite shows on TV.

B0011FTQ4O|4.0|The \\"extended\\" version of Almost Famous also known as Untitled is one of the best films of the past decade.  I had considered ordering it directly from the UK site but chose against it fearing I would not get a Region A compatible disc.   My only two regrets are  a)insufficient extras. The ideal disc would have had EVERYTHING from the 2 DVD set including Cameron's commentary,the Stairway scene,and a Making of doc on the original DVD that wasn't on the 2 disc set I also have and will keep  b) chapter stops inconsistent with the DVD. There are only 16 chapter as opposed to the 30 on the DVD and the last chapter runs over 20 minutes.    update: I think they read my review as the domestic blu ray has EVERYTHING! Unfortunately it is currently a Best Buy exclusive
B000FZETIO|5.0|Molly Ringwald is pretty in pink, though she is gorgeous no matter what shade she wears. Andie Walsh in PIP is Molly's signature role. You'd think that a film titled Pretty in Pink would be all about the clothes, but apart from the pink prom dress she put together by combining two vintage dresses, I preferred her wardrobe from 16 Candles or The Breakfast Club. Besides, she was out dressed at every turn by Duckie (Jon Cryer) and Iona (Annie Potts).<br /><br />Duckie is her blatant admirer who rides by her house about 100 times a day on his bike. Does he ever park? No, he is more of a drive-by kind of guy. He appreciates her sense of fashion, because his own is even quirkier. They both like to work those hats.<br /><br />--------------------------<br />Duckie: May I admire you again today?<br />=============================================<br /><br />They have a close friendship, though it is obvious that Duckie wants more. \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" by The Smiths, and heard on the soundtrack, could serve as his anthem. Jon Cryer was a fabulous Duckie with all his ducks in a row. This is his best role, and the one he will be remembered for, apart from playing Alan Harper in the syndicated sit com Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen. He was such a cute kid. What happened?<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Andie: So what do you want to drink?<br />Duckie: Oh you know, beer, scotch, juice box... whatever.<br />============================================<br /><br />Cryer had another great sit com but no one saw it, a great show about two architects called Partners that only lasted one season. Cryer was Bob (22 episodes, 1995-1996). Does anyone besides me remember this show?<br /><br />Besides out dressing Ringwald -- his tuxedo even trumps her pink dress at the prom -- Cryer and Potts almost steal the show with their romance. They nearly hijacked PIP and made it into the sequel to HAM (Harold and Maude).<br /><br />--------------------<br />Duckie: You know what an older woman does for me?<br />Iona: Changes your diapers?<br />Duckie: Touch&eacute;.<br />==============================<br /><br />Iona keeps Duckie at bay with her wisecracks, but after Duckie kisses Iona to make Andie jealous, Duckie and Iona almost hook up. This train derails when she starts dating a yuppie pet shop owner who arrives suddenly like some kind of deus ex machina.<br /><br />Annie Potts as Iona was the coolest vintage record store owner in Chicago since Rob Gordon in High Fidelity. She is a perpetual adolescent and surrogate mother/cool boss to Andie Walsh, always there for her with a quick quip or a shoulder to cry on. She is the perfect mixture of mother and best friend for a post-date recap:<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Andie: Well, not nothing. I mean, I kissed him...<br />Iona: Anywhere interesting?<br />===========================================<br /><br />Her unique fashion sense is all the stranger coming from someone who would play Interior Decorator Mary Jo Shively in 151 episodes of \\"Designing Women\\" from 1986-1993. Iona lives in a Chinese Restaurant converted into her humble abode with a lot of the original decor intact. Besides her outrageous clothes, she also has a passion for wigs that borders on the criminal. Indeed, she was in Ken Russell's Crimes of Passion, and one of her wigs looks like it was stolen from China Blue.<br /><br />Harry Dean Stanton was good as Andie's father, who is still not over Andie's mother leaving. Andie has to push him to get out of bed in the morning and look for a better job. She has taken over the parent role, in a way, and dishes out the tough love. Still, they have great rapport. Repo Man and Paris, Texas are the must-see Harry Dean Stanton roles.<br /><br />Andrew McCarthy was OK but not great as Blane, the richie who faced a lot of pressure when he tried to date a poorie. The issue was would he go against the grain and date Andie in spite of parental and peer pressure, but what did Andie see in Blane, anyway?<br /><br />-------------------<br />Andie: You know you're talking like that just because I'm going out with Blane.<br />Duckie: His name is Blane? Oh! That's a major appliance, that's not a name!<br />=========================================<br /><br />I don't know about a major appliance, but Blane is kind of a tool. McCarthy and Ringwald were also together in Fresh Horses, where Molly is even poorer, and Ben Stiller is the rich friend who tries to steer him away from Ringwald. Fresh Horses focuses much more on McCarthy, with Ringwald's Jewell being a mysterious figure that may or may not be married. Is she a real Jewell or merely costume jewelry? In Fresh Horses, the gap between the two is much wider, and harder for McCarthy's character to bridge. He is studying to be an architect, but she is a backwoods yahoo. Even the test audiences felt that they shouldn't get together.<br /><br />James Spader was good in PIP as the rich jerk, Steff. Spader has a similar role to the one he played in PIP in The Rachel Papers, were he plays the rival for Ione Skye's affections. He makes a good jerk, but would later branch out to more sympathetic and complex roles, like the naive innocent under the Bad Influence of Rob Lowe. His break out role would have to be sex, lies, and video tape.<br /><br />John Hughes wrote Pretty in Pink but didn't direct it. Don't fall for that trick trivia question. Howard Deutch was the director, and it was Deutch's directorial debut. Since PIP is practically a sequel to 16 Candles it is fitting that Deutch would go on to direct three sequels for which he hadn't directed the original films (Grumpier Old Men, The Odd Couple II, & The Whole Ten Yards).<br /><br />The audience at the test screening didn't buy Duckie and Andie getting together at the end, so the studio made them change it. They had to call back the actors to reshoot, even though McCarthy had shaved his head for his next film. He had to wear one of Iona's wigs. Hughes wanted to keep his original ending, and later made Some Kind of Wonderful (1987), almost a remake of PIP, just so he could do the ending he wanted. Hughes wanted Ringwald to do SKOW, but she wisely refused to reprise her role yet again, resulting in a falling out and they never worked together afterwards.<br /><br />If Robert Downey Jr. had been cast as Duckie, it might have ended with Andie and Duckie getting together, because Downey, unlike Cryer, didn't give Molly a brotherly vibe. Downey Jr. is the only one I can think of who could have escaped the friend bag Duckie was stuck in. Anthony Michael Hall couldn't get out of his friend bag in 16 Candles, and he was offered the role of Duckie but wisely turned it down. Dweezil Zappa, who played Simon in PIP, was actually Molly's boyfriend at the time. Would the test audience have bought them as a couple?<br /><br />Besides Dweezil, keep your eye out for Gina Gershon and Andrew 'Dice' Clay. Clay is the bouncer at Trax, the night club where the PIP crew hang. If you are ever asked who the bouncer in Flashdance was, it wasn't the dice man, but Lee Ving, the singer of So Cal punk group Fear. I could have sworn it was Andrew.<br /><br />New Order, Echo & the Bunnymen, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, INXS, along with the title track by The Psychedelic Furs gave this film the quintessential 80's vibe, but it also used older songs like \\"Copacabana (At the Copa)\\" by Barry Manilow, \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" by Otis Redding, and \\"Cherish\\" by The Association to its advantage.<br /><br />Pretty in Pink is a classic High School romance, and it also owns the 80's. Pretty in Pink is to the 80's what Reality Bites is to the 90's. It is a high point of the Hughes oeuvre, even if he didn't direct, but merely wrote it. I think the ending is fine, even if Hughes didn't. Besides Molly Ringwald being so pretty in pink, you also have Cryer and Potts.

This Movie is based on true story   If you like martial arts sure you will love Ip Man  The Legendary ((Bruce Lee)) was one of Ip Man Students   Just take my advice buy this one and you will never regret it .
1416550542|5.0|Once in a while, you meet someone who seems distant, detached, shut. You, too, may keep yourself distant from this person, out of a sense that you cannot ever mean anything to that person, perhaps because you fear that someone could be around you and not want you close. You may even disdain the person for not wanting you to be intimate. This is a form of self preservation; it does not mean that you are right, or that the other is wrong.<br /><br />I am a forty-one year old man, a former police officer. I have worked in jails and seen terrible things. Nothing hurts so much as seeing the pain of one you love. I love a character in this book. I wish I could tell you why, but then, that is my story, and you deserve yours. I sobbed as this book drew to a close, and I wailed in grief and joy, mixed so inextricably I could no longer separate the one from the other. Such is the slow, gentle way that this story tells itself, with hurting souls drifting in the magical wake of one whose suffering was never known fully, because she chose not to give her sorrow to those around her.<br /><br />Do not read this book if you do not want to find out that fairy tales are only another way for us to understand truth, and that magic is real and only waiting for us to see it. Do not read this book if you prefer to judge early and regret late. Most importantly, do not read this book if you do not understand that the truest love may hurt more than any injury evil can do.<br /><br />Once upon a time, we all knew what mattered. Kate Morton shows us someone who never forgot, a faerie queen trapped in mortal flesh, whose suffering for love transcends one's first judgment and whose commitment to what matters transcends one's regrets at having misunderstood. This book is a maze, and you should think about your heart before you step in. For those who do, look for the girl with the blazing hair and cerulean eyes. She will see you through, if you believe, for you won't be coming back unchanged, andfaeries are real, just around the corner, in the garden.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|This is an exceptional album by McLaughlin and Santana, but one song is missing.  That song is none other than \\"Flame Sky.\\"  They played this song on the Love Devotion Surrender Sessions, but decided to use that song on the Santana's Welcome Album.  If they had included Flame Sky on this album, this might have been one of the greatest albums of all time. They also played it when they toured to support this album with the incredible Cobham, Peraza, and Young. I was too young to see these guys live but I try to see them in my minds eye.  Billy Cobham is sick on the life divine, just simply not human. The Love Supreme is amazing as they just scream at each other through their instruments.  A lot of guitarists borrowed from this project, using two guitarist to trade off licks off one another, but my friends this is the original combo, not to mention the incredible other musicians. McLaughlin's greatest electric solo is at the end of the piece Life Divine and he has another one at the end of Flame Sky but again not on this album. Meditation is so beautiful as well as Namia.<br />I am a McLaughlin historian so I know a lot of facts about what was happening. Columbia/Sony was going to release the live album (Chicago or another show) to support the album, because it went gold. But when he broke up the original MO, Columbia disregarded the live album, which is still not out. What a mini tragedy. They in turn didn't release t third MO album not until 20 something odd years later.  I wish that band would have stayed together a bit longer.<br />Another note is the bassist Doug Rauch was a pioneer, way ahead of everyone at this time.  He had a certain style that was unique among bass players. Larry Young was amazing on every piece he played on as well, just amazing and another pioneer that is so underrated.<br />When I first heard this on a record player when I was 16 I thought of something spiritual and divine and it hit straight to the heart..  I knew that this was mainly McLaughlin's album (he had more compositions) from the influence of his current band at the time.  It's that zen music.  This album is a tribute to John Coltrane the greatest soloist ever!! When I was 19, I gave a friend drummer the album \\"Love Supreme\\" and \\"Love Devotion Surrender\\" at the same time. My friend couldn't believe it, he was beyond words.  Later he told me, \\" you know man there is something terribly wrong with this world.\\" I knew exactly what he meant a few years ago when I got into jazz/fusion/carnactic  ect.  I told him that this is the music of God.  Now, I feel that its sad where we are in America's non music culture where sex sells everything, and these guys that don't play instruments and talk about nothing while getting payed millions.  It's a scary world out there, when you have LDS type music that basically doesn't exist anymore, but the b.s.  is all over our society.bum (he had more compositions) from the influence of his current band at the time.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout in a short amount of time.  After 20 minutes with Jillian, I feel like I spent hours in the gym.
B000001GMH|5.0|I gather from reading through the other comments that several listeners find this disc wanting.  I'm really quite happy with it.  So happy in fact, that I rank it high among my personal bests.  The others include Robert Shaw in Atlanta (Telarc, SACD), Jochum in Berlin (red book CD), Tilson Thomas in Cleveland (red book), Plasson in Toulouse (red book).<br /><br />To my ears the first thing to treasure on this disc is the rich playing of the Vienna Philharmonic.  They have shine and tonal depth in each and every department.  Yet their forward drive hardly ever falls short of connoting a special sort of musical elegance.  I guess maybe it is a James Bond thang -  a strikingly handsome action hero with plenty of muscle, sipping shaken martinis with one hand while using deadly martial arts on the other hand to keep a whole gaggle of bad guys at bay.  With Vienna, the impossible western classical music orchestra becomes more than possible.<br /><br />And all that yumminess, caught live in concert.  Whew.  I think I've just gotten a nice box of designer chocolates, sprinkled with coke powder.  Or something else, surpassing, strange.<br /><br />The choruses are completely on point, too.  So far as my ears can hear.  They have just as much musical eight to carry as the band; and nobody fell asleep the night this one was being sung.  Yes, conductor Andre Previn paces some sections of this forward-driving cantata more slowly, and he takes the tempo space as an effective opportunity to draw out all the color, expressiveness, and vocal or instrumental detail - that seemingly inexhaustible showmanship-display which Orff seems to have been able to write into this piece.  If the instrumental players and the choruses were not capable of significant tonal heft and contrast and color, framed in precisely etched rhythmic acumen, slower tempos would probably make me sleepy, going all soft into the sofa.  Hardly the case, folks.  Previn's tempos are not all that extreme or eccentric anyways; and given the talent on this disc, his reading ends up sounding like Rolls Royce transportation to Orff-ian musical realms.<br /><br />Yes, of course, I wish all this had been captured in super audio surround sound.  Regular red book stereo hardly seems like the absolute sonic best an engineer in Vienna could do.  But, contrarily.  My ears tell me this red book recording comes across as well as any other of the best ones I have sitting on my fav shelves.  I thought maybe I could pick up the alleged flaws or lacks by listening on high quality headphones.  But no, as usual, the headphones just brought all the goodness home, close up and personal.  No complaints from my ears, then.  The huge collection of instruments, singers, and hall venue resonance is wide frequency, detailed - not muddy, restricted, thin, or boxy.<br /><br />If you want an example of flawed sonics, go back to some other disc.  I don't think this one is really in that running.<br /><br />Soloists?  Soprano Barbara Bonney is singing live, remember?  She manages to combine the best of the two types of soprano that usually get assigned this part.  She can chime with bell clarity, even in her highest reaches; and she shows plenty of heft, as when this soprano work is taken on by a more dramatic type of coloratura.  Frank Lopardo's roasted swan really cannot be faulted.  It's a character part, after all, meant to paint a musical scene of garish gusto, from the point of view of the poor swan being eaten, somehow roasted but reporting the scene to us, live.  In fact, to my ears, Lopardo actually conveys touches of musical value, along with his Halloween Haunted House story-telling.<br /><br />The brunt of the vocal solo assignments in this cantata is clearly borne by the bass-baritone.  On this disc, Anthony Michaels-Moore is simply way better than good, vocally.  Omnia sol temperat is suave and polished, completely fluent.  Estuans enterius is commanding, but the singer never has to resort to the barking and booming that some vocalists use to cope with the rhythmic outlines of the vocal line. His Ego sum abbas references both the implied, free touches of plainsong and chant in one of the abbot's religious services, while making good music no matter where the tipsy abbot's brag rings out in the fluid tessitura.  I hear no sense of vocal strain, even when the abbot's challenge rises high and triumphant with victory at the gaming tables.  Circa mea pectora moves right along, with Michaels-Moore serving up yet more of that burnished tone, no weariness in sight.  He handles the a capella embroidery of Si puer cum puellula with utter accuracy, points the skipping rhythms, and keeps that golden vocal tone going throughout.<br /><br />So, to recap.  I cannot hear the flaws or defects that others hear in this disc or its alleged sonics.  Instead, I hear plenty of amazing musical stuff, enough to make it a lasting treasure of an Orff cantata reading.  The soloists are a definite plus - like the Vienna band.  More than enough to handle the music, and coming across strong with oodles of tonal heft in every department at every sound level in all frequencies.  That's why to me, this one is a fav shelf keeper, all stars.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Cable TV classic. Often brings my channel surfing to a halt. Thumbs up to the performers and to those amazing filmmakers, the Coen Brothers. In particular George Clonney. He needs his Dapper Dan promade and when he says, \\"We're in a real tight spot\\" I care. John Turturro can't suc. Blake Nelson looks and sounds just right for the part. And John Goodman is terrific _as always_. The much ballyhooed about soundtrack is pretty good, but I agree that the 1927 Harry McClintock version of \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" *by far* is the definite highlight. I felt vindicated when I read influential music/culture critic Greil Marcus say the same. LOVE that song! Marcus says \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" by Harry should have been on the landmark \\"Anthology of American Folk Music\\". Btw, since I mention Marcus he hits the nail on the head here as regards the soundtrack: \\"it's no surprise the album reached so many people so strongly--if you don't know this music, it's like doors in a mountain opening, and you can't help but want to go inside. It's an old-timey version of The Harder They Come soundtrack, and there's as much to discover in a more-where-this-came-from sense as there was there\\". Right.<br /><br />So yeah, as you may notice, it ain't \\"Fargo\\". But then what is? Well I was just thinking about this movie. I was not that impressed by it when I first saw it. But you know, I can't put my finger on **why**. And that is bothersome. Too high expectations? No. I didn't have many expectations one way or the other. Was it the, to my mind anyhow, - excessive buzz around it. Hmmm. That may have played a part. You just hear too much about somethan and it somehow takes away form the impact. You, without realizing it, end up a little turned off. It's like, \\"that's it?\\". That's what all the fuss is about?<br /><br />But now I love \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\". The Coen Brothers make me proud to be an American.

1416914307|4.0|*Here there be SPOILERS.*     In City of Glass, Clary and the Shadowhunters have the final showdown with her evil father, Valentine--and a few other demonic types.     In the first book of the series, we meet Clary, a teenage \\"mundane\\" and her BFF Simon in NYC, where they soon learn there's another world entirely--and they both have a part (or several) to play in that world. In this final book, we find out why she has such a sense of connection to Jace, the brother she really always wanted, and Sebastian, who claims a special connection to her. Simon, who was a geek, has made a number of transformations of his own. What happens to Alec and his older love interest? Does Clary's mother ever heal...and does she end up with the man who has always loved her? Who wins in this epic matchup of good and evil?    The way the author ties up all the loose ends might be predictable...but it was very moving just the same. There are some unexpected plot unfoldments, but it is the cast of characters and Clare's great sense of humor that really make this book (and the series) well worth a few hours of your time.

B0013FNC38|5.0|I had heard a song from jason mraz's album on a tv commercial and really liked the song. I didn't know at the time who the singer was. I then browsed through songs at Amazon and thought the title of this particular album was funny and interesting. When I heard tunes from the album, I found the song I heard on the tv, and found out that all the songs on this album are great. Great voice, unique style, not tiring. Worth getting into a collection
0061122416|2.0|Having just finished The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, I must say that it certainly did not live up to my expectations. Probably those who most enjoy this simple story were not influenced by all the hype and therefore did not expect as much out of this book as I did. Having let down my high expectations, I was left wondering why it took Coelho 167 pages to say that we should all follow dreams, no matter what obstacles stand in our way. While I commend Coelho for wanting to convey this message, I just don't believe The Alchemist was the best avenue in doing so. In summary, the simplistic tone and bare-bones message of the book makes it a quick read that would be more applicable for a teenager than for adults.
B001AACEP8|4.0|I enjoy the music of Katy Perry, she is as good as Christina Agulira.  Both have great voices.
0393324818|5.0|Never been a baseball fan, but picked up \\"Moneyball\\" based on the prior and very enjoyable experience of reading Michael Lewis's work - happy to say that the book did not disappoint! The author sets out to answer a simple question: how did the Oakland A's, one of the poorest teams in the league, manage to win so many games against much better funded opponents? Of course, money is not everything, but great talent costs money, so how did they do it?<br /><br />Turns out, the baseball talent market was inefficient (in a technical sense), meaning that by virtue of history and established practices, often times the scouts would pay for attributes that had little to do with the success of the team. Michael Lewis provides a number of interesting insights into the birth of \\"sabremetrics\\" (statistical analysis of baseball), and how it has changed the game within a short span of the past few years.<br /><br />A fantastic read and an illustrative case study, regardless if you are a baseball fan or not.
0312370849|3.0|This book started out excetionally strongly - riviting, with wonderful historical detail.  Toward the middle it got miserably bogged down with the author unsure of her first language.  This piece could have used stronger editing to clean up gramatical errors and frequently clumsy language.  It is a shame that it was not proof read more critically.  Extrodinary story - somewhat lumpy presentation.  C+
8590379825|5.0|Lua is a beautiful, extremely easy to learn (even for non-programmers) and a very compact language, which is why it has become such a popular choice for embedded scripting applications (WoW, Lego Mindstorms, Symbian and virtually every Linux distribution). I've picked up the book to familiarize myself with it as I was investigating a Lua scripting interface for a database library (Tokyo Cabinet), but have subsequently gone much more in depth with the language - it's a fun one!<br /><br />Written by the creator of the language, the book is very well structured and will get you from 0 to 60 in no time flat. The examples are abundant and the writing style is clear and to the point. You'll start off with the basics of \\"hello world\\", move on to strings, functions and the associative data model, and then gradually migrate towards learning the ins and outs of the core libraries and more advanced topics such as inheritance, modules and OO with Lua.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|First of all: I'm a big fan of Final Fantasy VII and just the fact of knowing that \\"Advent Children\\" was coming on Blu-Ray made me really happy. I ordered it even though I already own a DVD copy, ´cause they said it will have a few extra minutes of new material. It is true and I enjoyed every single minute of the film with the Hi-Def plus!    This movie is a must have for every Final Fantasy fanatic (not just FFVII fans) and also I recommend it for those who want a different story or just to enjoy amazing visuals and quality animation.    10 out of 10. Greetings from Mexico.
0786856297|5.0|Man, this is a great read. What an great idea for a story. Percy Jackson is 11 years old, and something is different about him. He doesn't know it yet, but he's the son of a Greek God, and a very powerful God. However, everyone isn't so pleased to see him. Someone has stolen Zeus's Master Lighting bolt, and has framed Percy. He has little time to find out who stole the bolt and why, and also try to stop a war that's coming to Mt. Olympus.<br /><br />This is such a great read.  If you have a child in 4th, 5th, or 6th grade, then this is a must read for them.  They'll be hooked after the first Chapter!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is a great collection by the late, great Michael Jackson.  It should have been a 3-CD set however, that included more songs with Michael singing lead with the Jackson 5, tracks from Blood On The Dance Floor, and a couple missing from Invincible i.e. Butterflies. (Shamoooannn Epic!?)    I didn't notice that the songs on this compilation were radio-edits as stated in previous reviews, but that doesn't lessen the quality.  I think the songs were remastered, because they sound great on CD compared to the cassettes and vinyl that we first discovered Michael on.
0515141429|5.0|Meet Jack Reacher. He's an ex-MP and was on a long bus ride when he got off and walked into town. Seems normal enough, but fate had something else for Reacher. He's been arrested for murder. He has no idea how much trouble he's in.  The thing about Reacher is that if you back him into a corner, he comes out fighting.<br /><br />This is the first book in a great series! This has so many plot twist and turns, and is well thought out, and well written.  You can't help but to root for a guy like Reacher.<br /><br />Trust me, if you start the series, you'll be hooked like me. Enjoy the ride.
B0028K31CE|4.0|After listening to BLACK, I feel that Maxwell has definitly grown as an artist. That being said... this is still probably only his 3rd best set. Embrya is the best full collection of work. Many people don't get it but that CD plays great with or without lyrics. 2nd or 1A is Urban Hang Suite, only because it has a flat moment or two. Last is Now, which may have more great songs than BLACK but overall this set is stronger.     The opening track is worth the price of admission. Bad Habits starts out as vintage bedroom Maxwell at his best. Then one minute in the beat drops. The pace changes and grooves sets in. Halfway through here comes the horn section swingin. Then just before it ends we are in funk mode. Outside of that and Pretty Wings there are not many grand moments but I think the more I listen the more I'm going to like.     I think the effort here was to get a more natural sound through the band and not just go for what may be the easiest route to a #1 hit. For that I can give him much credit because I'm sure his label wanted Embrya/Hang Suite. BUT...I do think he misses Stuart Matthewman (Sade). I think he contributed to the sound we know as Maxwell.
B000NY62MI|5.0|Touching, humerous and challenging.  Tuesdays with Morrie offers a perspective on life which is worthy of integrating into one's own practices.  A book that one finds difficult to put down.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I have read another book that was written in this same style recently, and it was one of the better books I've read this summer ([[ASIN:0060821442 Last Days of Summer]]).  Interestingly enough, it is also set during the war.  I'd check it out, if you liked Guernsey...
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Great compilation of MJ songs!!!  Just got this yesterday and am really pleased with the selection of songs on this set.  Of course, it doesn't have every song I would have wanted (for example: Will You Be There) but definitely has most of them.  I was also surprised when I got it b/c I didnt realize that the 5th disc is actually a live concert (Michael Jackson Live in Concert in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour which is sold here on Amazon for $12.99) which I had seen before and really enjoyed.  So if you want a really great collection of songs along with a concert, this is the collection to get!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book set in in Nazi Germany that was not centered on someone Jewish?  Never read one before this.      There are two things that I think made this enjoyable for me:  first, I really liked the main character and wanted to know what would happen to her.  Second, sometimes Death would actually tell you what was going to happen, long before it actually happened.  When you know the ending in advance, you aren't so concerned with what ultimately happens, but instead with everything in between, so it keeps you reading.  At least, it did for me.
B000AOEN2C|5.0|It is the mid 22nd Century: over a hundred years before Kirk and Spock. The crew of Earth's latest breakthrough Warp 5 starship; led by Captain Jonathan Archer, are making their first steps into the galaxy. Firmly believing humankind has been held back for too long by Vulcan interference, Archer is eager to embark on Enterprise's mission of deep space exploration. Survival proves perilous the farther from home they travel. Outmatched by superior aliens equipped with far more powerful weaponry, this first crew face a steep learning curve. Among their challenges will come Klingon aggression, militaristic Andorians, territorial Romulans and the Suliban; a race receiving aid from the future. This Temporal Cold War story arc heats up with the arrival of a probe sent by the Xindi and seven million people die in an unprovoked attack. With another more powerful weapon being assembled deep within the Delphic Expanse, Starfleet hastily curtails the Enterprise's assignment, sending their most experienced crew in a desperate attempt to save Earth. Along the way, we discover familiar trek-nology from future Star Trek series at a less advanced stage including a crew scared to use the transporter, so frequent use of space suits, decompression airlocks & shuttle-pods and instead of shields, polarised hull-plating. Those coming straight from JJ Abrams' 2009 movie will probably appreciate this uncomplicated style the most. The rest of us get to have fun spotting familiar elements from past series, especially by the fourth season - as we visit the Mirror Universe, encounter green skinned Orions, as the Vulcans gradually come to respect their illogical allies and together make the first steps toward uniting warring aliens and form the Federation.<br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />First released back in 2005, this collection includes all 97 episodes starring Scott Bakula (from Quantum Leap, as Archer), Jolene Blalock (T'Pol), Connor Trinneer (Trip), Dominic Keating (Reed), Linda Park (Sato), Anthony Montgomery (Mayweather) & John Billingsley (Dr. Phlox).<br /><br />1.

Her relationship with Trip, which manages to rise above its somewhat exploitive origins and her struggle to maintain control over her emotions. At this point, I should also make it clear I loved what Enterprise did with the Vulcans and how they are every bit the race seen all the way back to the Original Series. I could continue to outline traits of the various other regulars, who are anything but cyphers in my opinion. Under developed in comparision to the big three for sure but I feel that was changing... even Travis Mayweather got in on the action by the end.<br /><br />I love the technology - grapplers instead of tractor beams, phase pistols and EM rifles, airlocks and shuttlepod deployed from bomb bay doors underneath. When you're at a disadvantage, you have nothing but your wits to rely on and this show was about as far from Voyager's technobabble saves the day approach as it was possible for Trek to realistically get.<br /><br />I still believe this is the show with the most potential left unexplored. 2 reasonably good seasons, 2 excellent ones which kept me watching and yet still barely scratched the surface. Had I been in charge of CBS/Paramount in 2005, I certainly would not have cancelled this... not considering how well the stories were coming along in leaps and bounds. Shame on the Executive who made that decision. I hope they're looking at the popularity of Star Trek in cinemas at the moment, and think back to that day fans held a rally outside the studio, sent emails and letters... all protesting the loss of a show that had finally turned the tide into fan acceptance, only to be unjustly rewarded with the axe.
0385340575|5.0|As always Lee Child comes through with another good book.  I think I have read all of his books and always enjoy them.
B0019N95IK|4.0|It is the mid 22nd Century: over a hundred years before Kirk and Spock. The crew of Earth's latest breakthrough Warp 5 starship; led by Captain Jonathan Archer, are making their first steps into the galaxy. Firmly believing humankind has been held back for too long by Vulcan interference, Archer is eager to embark on Enterprise's mission of deep space exploration. Survival proves perilous the farther from home they travel. Outmatched by superior aliens equipped with far more powerful weaponary, this first crew face a steep learning curve. Among their challenges will come Klingon aggression, militaristic Andorians and the Suliban; a race receiving aid from the future.<br /><br />Those whose discovered Star Trek through JJ Abrams' 2009 movie and are currently awaiting the 2013 sequel - Star Trek Into Darkness, will probably appreciate Enterprise's uncomplicated \\"stripped back\\" technology style the most. It pitches all the familiar trek-nology seen in the other Star Trek TV series and films at a less advanced stage, trying for something less routine and far-future fantastical. Much of the crew are too scared to use the transporter, a device mostly called upon to beam equipment and supplies around. Instead space suits are regularly seen, together with having to step through complicated airlocks and time spent in decompression and decontamination. Phase pistols are the defensive side arm of choice. Although with projected energy weapons having only recently replaced pulse, blaster-style ones, they're still as Starfleet experimental as the Enterprise NX-01 starship itself. Instead of invisible shields that encompass whole starships like a bubble, protection from alien attack comes down to polarising the hull plating. Instead of tractor beams, capturing another ship requires a grappler deployed from bomb bay doors on the underside, through which small shuttlepods are regularly launched. When you're at a disadvantage, you have nothing but your wits to rely on and this show was about as far from the 24th Century's technobabble saves the day approach as it was possible for Trek to realistically get.<br /><br />One of the aspects that sets Enterprise apart from Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, is the more down-to-earth characterisation of its crew and often a \\"first time\\" naivety when faced with a perilous universe. They're imperfect and largely unprepared for a galaxy full of alien lifeforms, extraordinary circumstances, stumbling and making misteps along the way - often with best of intentions. Captain Archer, interested me from the outset (being a fan of Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap) his Captain out there alone with no support, no rulebook or role models to learn from their mistakes. He's a man with a strong prejudice about the Vulcans. While that and some questionable decisions often bring him dangerously close to unlikeable, we get plenty of examples throughout the series that Star Trek's most famous pointy-eared race also still have someway to go, in order to evolve into the likeable kind typified by Spock and Tuvok. Better aspects to Archer's personality are brought out by Shran, a blue-skinned Andorian who appears semi-regularly throughout the 4 years and twice during Season One. Both are deeply skeptical of the Vulcans and yet altogether, they will ultimately end up forging an interstellar alliance known as the Federation.<br /><br />Other notable crew members include Trip, a likable Southern Engineer who's long friendship with his Captain, somehow manages to survive his occasional bouts of insubordination. T'Pol, initially an observer from a Vulcan government concerned about the impact of humankind's deep exploration, serves as the Enterprise's Vulcan Science Officer and gradually grows more accustomed to an almost entirely human crew and their different perspective. Also helpful is the ship's eternally optimistic alien Doctor, Phlox. He's a Denobulan, who often treats the crew with some very unusual medicine including the leech-like, osmotic eel! In charge of defending the ship, is an explosives obsessed, British armoury officer named Malcolm Reed. Hoshi Sato deftly handles alien languages, in her role as the ship's Communications Officer. Finally space boomer Travis Mayweather is the navigator, one of few humans born in space to a family who run a cargo ship.<br /><br />Like the Original Series in the 1960s, Enterprise came to a premature end when it was cancelled in 2005 after only 4 seasons. Unlike previous series The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, this show wasn't widely syndicated beyond the now defunct network TV station, UPN. A revealing brand-new 3 part retrospective documentary promises to delve deep into Enterprise's misfortunes. What it was like making Star Trek after a decade and a half uninterrupted run... and how the show wasn't entirely the prequel its producers wanted to make. How they had to deal with Network Executives for the first time, who hampered creative decisions with what they required a Star Trek series to include. Even given those flaws, I ultimately enjoyed much of this show while it lasted... particularly Season 4. I still believe there is unfulfilled potential left in Enterprise and it holds a unique place - as a prequel to both the old franchise and JJ Abrams' motion pictures. After many years without brand new Star Trek adventures beaming across our television screens (where it belongs)... there's perhaps no better time to reappraise this in High Definition. See both where it all began and ironically, how it all ended.

B0013FSL3E|2.0|Wall-E unfortunately had the worst writing of any cartoon movie. There was very little dialogue except the two main robots repeating each others names over and over again. Also, the morbidly obese humans and environmental message were heavy handed and annoying. Skip this movie and watch Up or Nemo or Ratatouille.
B002436WJE|5.0|This is a great movie, would recommend it to any one who has teenage kids who want to travel.. Yes it is a little too much, on what could happen to a young teenager, but it's a good movie to see with your kids over 14yr...loved it!
B000QYBB6M|5.0|Listened to this Book on CD on a recent trip.  It was so enjoyable...and I believe one of the reasons was the way the reader put such enthusiasm into her work...just listening to the pronunciations of the names was such fun!  Now the TV series brings all the characters to life.
0312370849|2.0|The historical basis for this story is absolutely fascinating. Perhaps that's why this book garnered a 4-star rating. However, the 'present-day' sections lacked depth, the characters lacked authenticity and the dialog was even less real. It was very disappointing. I often purchase books based on Amazon readers' recommendations. They were way off this time! The second half of the book was very disappointing.
1439102813|5.0|The book takes you inside Alice's mind to I'm sure what's only a glimpse of her daily struggles with early onset Alzheimer's. The Author definitely knew what she was doing and did it beautifully. It was easy to read very hard to put down. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book. It's rare to be able to see and understand the daily struggles of this horrible disease. Although I don't have personal history of Alzheimer's, I feel a little bit more educated, empathetic, and inspired for further medical research. Please write another book soon Lisa!
B000UAFDP2|5.0|Great movie for anyone who likes action adventure comedy and sci/fi.  Looks great on blu-ray.
B001FB55H6|1.0|The one star review is meant to be misleading.  Just as the marketing of the 'comic' was.  The original graphic novel was a thought-provoking story which would have been better accepted as Japanese animation than in its comic-book guise.  Similarly, this film would have been better accepted if done in an art-film limited release manner.  Just looking at all the reviews on Amazon confirm it- the film polarizes people to the point where they simply must comment and discuss and think.  This is art and science fiction the way it's meant to be- forcing us to look again at society and ourselves.    The two biggest concerns I heard from people were Dr. Manhattan's pigsticker hangin' out and the graphic violence.  Neither, according to some, were necessary.  Simple question- if they were not necessary and incidental, then why are they generating such extensive discussion?  It's intriguing that the horrific violence in Saving Private Ryan was better accepted, mostly because such images are an accepted part of war.  Graphic violence is not typically viewed as a typical part of superhero stories, but it is, in fact, a part of comic book violence and anime.  Same thing with the sexuality of Dr. Manhattan and the scene with Silk and Night.    Viewed as an artful portrayal of a graphic novel, this film is brilliant.  There will be no sequel.  It will stand on its own.  And I bet in 10 years it'll still be selling on Amazon.
1416550542|5.0|This one hooked me from page one! It could have been confusing, yet I had no trouble keeping the characters straight as the story moves from the present back to 1900 and back to the present. The story unfolds as Cassandra follows her grandmother Nell's footsteps in the search for Nell's real parents. Cassandra travels to London from Australia after her grandmother dies, leaving Cassandra a house in London, and a request to try and solve the mystery of Nell's origins. As Cassandra finds herself caught up in the mystery of her grandmother's birth, she begins to find her own life in the process. I haven't read Kate Morton's other novel, The House at Riverton, but after I enjoyed this one so much, I am looking forward to reading it, and I hope there will be more from Ms. Norton in the future
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The Planet Earth series by BBC is absolutely fantastic. You do not have to be an environmentalist to enjoy the breath-taking cinematography or glimpses of animals rarely seen by humans. Planet Earth could easily be one of best documentaries of our time. On blu-ray this series is even more spectacular.     However, I was very disappointed to find out that this particular product does not have ANY behind the scenes footage or special features. The behind the scenes footage is important to me because it brings the whole series to life. When you understand what the film makers went through to get their shots, it makes Planet Earth that much more special. If behind the scenes footage is important to you as well I would recommend asking the seller beforehand if you are purchasing a copy that has it.
B00297FEUI|1.0|I am frustrated.  Frustrated that scores like this exist.  Remote Control is pumping out just as many overly-synthesized, repetitive scores as ever in recent years.  This score for Revenge of the Fallen has to be one of the worst, and they're all mediocre at best.  It is electronically obnoxious, constantly pelting you over the head with synthesized crashes, bass drums, low strings and perpetual ostinato...more or less like every other Zimmer, Jablonsky, Tyler, Smith, et al. score.  Themes are scarce, the Decepticon theme from the first score is completely abandoned here and the Autobot cue presented with grandeur but basically unchanged.  The ambiance that is presented is as generic as it is thoughtless.  The instrumentation, the progression, the fanfare (or lack there of) is all more or less interchangable with every other recent Remote Control effort.  The sound has been accepted by the mainstream, the popularity of the studio's output is testament to that fact.  However, movies like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen are also accepted by the mainstream, proving that viewers and listeners are far too content with mediocrity, or in this case, garbage.  While Giacchino's excellent score for Star Trek struggles to maintain a 4-star rating on Amazon, this score will likely reach 4.5 and most of the Remote Control's other works fare just as well or better.  The continual popularity of such music and films will ensure that nothing better is ever produced.  In defense of Jablonsky, would there really be any purpose in creating a complex and original score for a brainless movie like Transformers, most of which would likely go unheard below the explosions and metal-on-metal contact of the action on screen anyway?  Probably not, but again, the perpetual mediocrity of music and films like this will not change until audiences demand more.  This sound is so unbelievably tired, I suppose what we need is another Hans Zimmer to change the industry again.    Now, if you are oneof the many who thoroughly enjoy the sound associated with what Hans Zimmer and his minions have produced in the past, you can completely disregard my criticisms because 1)you don't care or you've likely heard them before, and 2) you will like this score just the same.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Hey plain and simple \\"It works\\" and for 5 bucks, how can you go wrong.
B000007T2Z|3.0|Godspeed's debut was an interesting far cry away from the precise celestial attacks they would flesh out on subsequent outings. These rural, idea-intensive sketches flow by underwhelming when put in a three part  context, but do indeed contain enough committed existential dread paired with minimalist melody to indicate why the committed collective would continue to sonically rattle many compositional cages.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I only got a catch a couple of the episodes of the season but I seem to find myself wanting to watch more but was never able to.  So I decided to get it here on Amazon because the price was great ($10 less than the stores)  and the fast shipping.  Now this show was good, and I can't wait for season two.  The picture is Cristal clear in Blu-ray,  haven't really checked out any of the extras (I never do).  All in all this is a good HBO show, and ready for season two.
B00011F5DK|3.0|This was too complicateed for some of my family members. But, then again, some others really like it and play every chance they get. The box is HUGE. It's not a fast game. There's several others games I would rather play.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|Why did Alan Ball feel like rewriting an already successful storyline?  As someone who has read every Charlaine Harris book written over the years, I was very disappointed that the TV series departs from the original Southern Vampire story on so many unnecessary levels. For example, the whole Tara storyline in the TV series is nothing short of ridiculous. I finally began to fast forward through those \\"Tara\\" segments, as they stink to high heaven with melodrama and poor acting.    If this series hopes to redeem itself, Mr. Ball should hand the writing reins back over to Ms. Harris or stick more closely to the storylines we all know and love.    The best part of the Season One episodes is the few intact story lines of Ms. Harris' kept in the scripts, i.e., Sookie and Bill's relationship.    If you still want to see it for yourself, I would recommend borrowing the series from the library or buying a used DVD rather than spending $$ for a new one.  People like me, who don't subscribe to HBO and waited for the series to come out on DVD, will soon be selling off their copies.  I doubt this series lasts past Season Two as it seems Mr. Ball is getting further and further away from the real Southern Vampire stories and more into his own stupid agenda.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Knofler and Harris at their best. The music and words are great from the first to the last song. I love to kick back and just enjoy the CD.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|I love movies set on the beach, on the ocean and under the ocean.  This is one of my favorite movies revolving around diving and it is set in one of my favorite places in the world:  Nassau, Bahamas.  There is a lot of diving, the main characters are hot and there's lots of bikini shots.  They get entangled with a drug dealer and there lazy island lifestyle turns into a fight for their lives.  Not everyone survives.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Every now and then something comes along that is clearly head and shoulders above the norm.  This helps to explain the extremely high rating that this compilation has achieved among the reviewers.  I have done some audio editing in my time and these guys made the difficult look simple. The sound is fresh, crisp and wonderful.  The video is inspiring.  I am purchasing more of these as they will make great gifts.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Probably the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. The drawing is superb, and the post-apocalyptic story is quite amazing. Having read the superbly illustrated comic book, I know how much of the story they've left out, but this one holds together quite well, until the ending at least. Akira himself barely appears in the film, although he's in the book quite a lot, ditto for the Joker, Chiyoko (who doesn't appear at all in the movie, although she's an awesome character) and Lady Miyako. Key characters in the story are Kaneda and Kei, who navigate the madness and anarchy of Tokyo in the year 2031, driving motorcycles, flying in mini-helicopters, shooting lasers and avoiding satellite-mounted death rays, while also seeking to avoid being smothered by the grotesque, out-of-control evolutions of Tetsuo.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I watched this concert on DVD last night for the first time since it originally aired in 1992 and it was just as powerful. Michael Jackson's live performances are better than any video he's ever done. What a master!
B000E33VWW|5.0|Anyone thinking that this was a film about the life of Truman Capote would probably be disappointed - it's actually about the events in Capote's life surrounding his most famous book, \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  Starting in 1959 when Capote reads about the Clutter murders in the newspaper, he eventually gets close to the Kansas community that the murder takes place in - despite his conspicuous and gawky other-worldliness - and spends seven years writing the book, in the meantime getting to know the murderers, and maybe even falling into a love/hate relationship with one of them.  For anyone who's ever read the book it should be obvious which of the two murderers he tried harder to understand, and this is the central relationship in a book about a man who has difficulty being truly sincere.  Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the movie are about Capote's manipulativeness and how people still sort of love him for it.  The relationship with childhood friend Harper Lee is also interesting; Lee famously only wrote one book, and after In Cold Blood Capote stopped publishing as well.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is immature and a bit annoying, but her repartee and relationship with the yuppies who want to adopt her unborn child are good fun, as is the odd dialogue she has with her father (played by ubiquitous character actor RK Simmons).  Any movie that references the Melvins with Sonic Youth has it in my book.  I'm also amused that Michael Cera, Juno's boyfriend (who, like the actress who played Juno, is Canadian), was also in Superbad.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|This movie feels no different than any other Wes Anderson film - it has Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston in it - and yet, there's something different.  What is it that is not quite the same?  Is it the fact that the film is set in India, that his cast of characters now includes Adrian Brody, or that it's finally been made clear that all the films are intended to run together?  There's nothing in the films any more that can be separated from one another, and maybe that's a good thing - aren't Nobel prizes granted for a cohesive body of work, rather than a single masterpiece?  Non sequitar dialogue, non sequitar scenery, the trademark drift around the location, and the subtle (but hilarious) sight gags - in this one, our protagonists inexplicably buy a cobra at market.  This one has the heavily mustachioed Jason Schwartzman, an actor I don't know but have enjoyed in this film; he also helped to write the screenplay, indicating that he's entered the troupe (maybe he's been in it for a while and I'm only noticing now...).  Flashback scenes where he is clean shaven are interesting for contrast, as is the \\"play before the movie\\" sequence with him and Nathalie Portman, playing a slutty something-or-other. The film strikes me as one of the more enjoyable Wes Anderson movies.  I like it.  Bill Murray's small, subtle role is great (some may consider it a mere sight gag), as is the Indian setting, as are the train staff, as are the villagers, as is the tiger.  Go, tiger, go.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|The Watchmen graphic novel (i.e. comic book) by Alan Moore is a masterpiece.  This film is the next best thing.  Although it doesn't capture all of the graphic novel in its entirety - how could it? - it does a great job with those bits that it does.  The ending has been changed somewhat, but I thought this had been done in a way that was actually a bit better than the graphic novel in parts (the disaster at the end of the graphic novel does come off as a bit absurd), although Dr Manhattan's decision at the end is ultimately not satisfying (and a bit similar to the Batman's decision at the end of The Dark Knight, come to think of it...).  The characters are all very well cast, with the exception perhaps of Dr Manhattan, who is just a bit too CG-ized for my liking.  Oh well, why be a scrooge when the framing was so masterful, and Rorsach so superbly crafted.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|If there was ever a better example of how a sequel can be soooo much better than the original, I really can't think of any - The Dark Knight is a million times better than the ludicrous Batman Begins. It may have been just a bit too violent, but all the parts fit together so well; the Joker's constant out-thinking of his opponents, his senseless violence, the inexplicable loyalty of his crazed, doomed hoods, and the Batman's ultimate, problematic decision. The plot just kept driving on and on and on and on, and the film had no superflous scenes. Aaron Eckhart was quite good as Two Face (the make-up was fantastic). Luckily, and Morgan Freeman's baffling presence was limited... as was Ng Chin Han's, the most unthreatening Asian villain ever. Watch it for Heath, who is mystery itself...
0131103628|5.0|In 1988, The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition (affectionately referred to as K&R2) was first printed. Despite the passing of so many years, C's syntax and semantics have remained fairly stable. It is then fitting that K&R2 remains the de facto manual and reference for helping programmers get acquainted with the C programming language. Dennis M. Ritchie, one of the co-authors, is the original designer of C and also helped design the Unix operating system in the '60s. Brian Kernighan also helped with the design of Unix, AWK, and is noted for creating other well-known Unix programs.<br /><br />Not only are the authors well qualified, but they communicate very effectively in concise and clear language. The authors do not pander or condescend to readers. They make no claims to teach C in only one day; they actually expect readers to have a basic grasp on various programming concepts. The authors show an earnest desire to help programmers learn the language. The code examples provided are very helpful and exceptionally elegantly coded. As other reviewers have noted, they help instill good coding habits from the start.<br /><br />K&R2 provides a helpful introduction to programmers, which gives an overview of what the C programming language is (and is not). The introduction explains C's typing system and basic features. The meat of the book is well organized into chapters that sequentially build upon previous chapters. Chapter 5, \\"Pointers and Arrays,\\" for example, does a great job at elucidating a difficult computer science concept. A lot of people are well aware of nasty bugs deriving from using pointers and arrays, but the authors explain pointers and arrays in a very clear way, which draws the important distinctions between them.<br /><br />After the main tutorial chapters, the appendix follows in an amazingly compact, yet thorough reference, which includes a C grammar, overview of the standard libraries, and more. Oftentimes, this reference is the most convenient and concise source for information (note that [[ASIN:0470845732 the C Standard]] is *the* authoritative source on the C specification).

It doesnt follow much of the story which is a let down, and the whole thing going on with tara, no one cares she wasnt important in the book dont make her important now -_-, and! the whole idea of her and sam bs, sam was sookies knight NOT Taras. the sex scenes where over the top, but i guess thats an HBO series for you. But anyways, i gave it 3 stars for some parts where really good and kept me at my toes but then a sex scene whould ruin it so dont take my word for it watch or dont.
B0028K31CE|4.0|To like 6 of 9 songs on a CD is pretty rare these days, and I don't really feel Maxwell's fast songs but I predict Help Somebody and Love You will do real well.  But Stop The World and Fistfuloftears are the best ones in my opinion.  THEY ARE JUST TOO SHORT!    Maxwell brings the new soul with an old school flavor.  He sounds like Prince on many cuts and Marvin Gaye on others.  If Prince wants to prolong his career he should collaborate with Maxwell or at least start creating some songs that sound like his.  He has lost a few steps with HIS new stuff.    I still want to see Maxwell, Sweetback, and Sade on the same ticket.  Someone in the know, GET IT STARTED OR START A RUMOUR OR SOMETHING!

0061231401|5.0|Just before he is murdered outside a Red Cross camp in Africa, Jason Gorman, son of an influential United States Senator, sends an email to his father. Attached are files about recently harvested, genetically modified corn growing in Africa. As he is stalked inside St. Peter's Basilica by a crossbow-bearing assassin, a Vatican archaeologist who has been researching the roots of Celtic Christianity leaves behind a leather pouch with a grizzly clue.<br /><br />Back in the United States, Sigma Force, a team of highly-skilled Special Forces soldiers trained in scientific disciplines and acting as field operatives, is called on to investigate. As readers familiar with James Rollins's previous Sigma Force novels know, the purpose of the Sigma Force is to investigate and secure sensitive scientific information that could threaten the welfare of the United States.<br /><br />The body count rises when a pair of Sigma Force operatives probes into the Senator's son's death and visits a biohazard lab at Princeton University. In the midst of analyzing the DNA studies of the genetically altered corn, which have been forwarded to him by Senator Gorman, a famed geneticist is tortured and killed inside the biohazard lab shortly before the Sigma Force operatives arrive.<br /><br />The bizarre murders on three continents share a gruesome link --- all three victims have a Druidic pagan cross burned into their flesh. Each of the murdered also has a connection to Viatus International. Because of the nature of the deaths, the role of Sigma Force becomes paramount in the investigation.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ivar Karlsen, head of Viatus International, has called a World Food Summit in Oslo, Norway. Karlsen meets with members of the Club of Rome to warn them of a global crisis. The Club of Rome is an international think tank composed of industrialists, world leaders, scientists --- even royalty.<br /><br />From the frozen fjords of Norway to the busy streets of Rome, the distant ruins of medieval abbeys and the lost tomb of a Celtic Saint, members of Sigma Force risk danger and death to discover a plot that reaches back to medieval times and threatens the existence of the world.<br /><br />THE DOOMSDAY KEY fuses science, technology, religion and myth into an unstoppable thriller. Like Rollins's other Sigma Force novels, it has a creative and frightening premise with larger-than-life heroes and villains battling each other on a global canvas. While Rollins is known for his complex and compelling plots, his latest novel also has well-developed and engaging minor characters, along with a touch of politics through mention of overpopulation, genetically modified food and the military's \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy on gays in the armed forces.<br /><br />The section found at the back of the book, \\"The Author's Note to Readers: Truth or Fiction,\\" gives details about several elements portrayed in the novel, and is a welcome addition.

B000FA5MUI|2.0|Ive read through Cat's Cradle twice and I'm convinced that Mr Vonnegut was either insane or is good at convincing the reader that he is.  The characters in the story are certifiable.  And the leadup to the climax is a trip through the rediculous and surreal.  That may very well was his intention, however the result is a book this is every much jarring  to try and get through.
0743290127|1.0|Wow - I could not believe how bad this book was.  Thin- to non-existent story line, embarrasingly vapid characters and amazingly poor writing.  How does stuff like this get printed?  I enjoyed \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" but the author stumbled badly in this most recent effort.  Either that, or she didn't really write her first one herself.  Please do NOT waste your money or your time on this.  Wow.  Still amazed at how bad this book was.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Don't leave the room while this is playing.  This is the best of Liam Nielson.  It qualifies him as bonafide action hero.  I'll watch it over and over again.

B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Eastwood did it again.  With all his anamosisty toward forigners, he   wasn't afraid to learn a lesson in American behavior.  Being retired Navy,  I learned my lessons many years ago.  This movie is his greatest.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Another goodie from an oldie. Eastwood excellent as usual. Classic example of suburban prejudice leading to new understandings and unfortunately tragic endings. Eastwood plays a character full of pride in himself and country, who comes up against newcomers, a Hmong family, who at first glance,  appear to be aliens in his street/world. Once he gets past his initial prejudice regarding the family, he realises that they are just like any other family, with all their flaws, just like his own. He soon realises that they are victims of crime, trying to avoid the insidious grasp of brutal Detroit streetgangs.  He sees a situation that he can change and with a lot of guts, savvy and understanding is able to open everyones eyes. Sadly, life is not always as straightforward nor does it always run smoothly and the choice he makes in the end, in the action he undertakes, serves a twofold purpose - tragic as it is. Good movie, well crafted and well acted.
B0028K3192|3.0|Wow, I was really expecting Maxwell to come with it with this particular album.  However, based on what I have heard on this cd, it seems as if he is working with totally different producers than before.  After all of the hype, this album really disappointed me unfortunately.  The only two songs I enjoyed were \\"Bad Habits\\", and of course \\"Pretty Wings\\".  I hope his next installment produces a better collection of songs.  Bring back the old Maxwell please!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Fantastic dvd.  Great acting and story.    Do not miss True Blood Season 1 AND the Sookie Stackhouse Series written Charlaine Harris.  I adore both the series and the books.

0307454541|1.0|The 300+ reviews say FAR more about the readers than about the book.  What part of whose brain, exactly, is stimulated by this book?<br /><br />THIS happy reader of fiction will return it to the library, after only 30 or 40 pages. I find it tedious, especially after just finishing Graham Greene's cogent and crisp \\"Our Man in Havana.\\"  But I expect it would have been tedious after reading a Wheaties box.<br /><br />Reading so little Swedish fiction in translation, did I expect something as focused as the somewhat similarly titled \\"The Man on the Balcony\\"?  Ah, it was only a hope.
0312360266|1.0|Besides having completely flat character development with the worst descriptive language ever found in a teen/tween series, this book provides hypocritical lessons for young females struggling to find themselves in the raging hormone environment that is high school.  If anything, this book is better for parents to read in order to develop a better \\"teenage vocabulary\\" but even at engendering pop culture, gossip girl is a better outlet than this waste of space novel/series.  Needless to say, I wouldn't even waste a visit to the library on book 2.

0786860707|5.0|Many call this book the closest thing to an absolute Bible for animation.  I'm personally inclined to agree.    However, the first thing you need to know is that this book is not an instruction book.  Neither this book, nor any other book, contains enough information to transform you from layman to professional in one fell swoop.  While it does contain invaluable information on animation, I promise you that you still have to work at it to perfect your ability.    That being said, the book does contain information that deals in all facets of animation, and, sometimes, on the wider scale of dramatic and literary techniques relating to the visual medium.  Since animation is essentially a unification of film, acting, drawing, and writing, techniques from all four are important.  This book does contain the twelve principles of animation - essentially, several key elements to any good animation, which are employed by any good animator, in anything from Disney's \\"Steamboat Willie\\" to Pixar's \\"Up.\\"    Speaking of Pixar, I would recommend this book to those interested in 3-dimensional animation as well - an art form that is built on the principles of the 2-dimensional.    Overall, this book is brilliantly written.  It can be witty at times, and is written in a voice that is both interesting and insightful.  It relates animation back to its roots in human nature and psychology, exploring why it has various effects on people.    The attentive reader will glean from this book not only a better understanding of the logic and technique behind animation, but perhaps a better ability to create his or her own animations, as well as a better knowledge of the history of Disney's animation (as an aside, this book is largely about Disney's animation form.  Thomas and Johnston try to include examples from outside Disney history, but as they are largely speaking out of experience, and as they needed to keep the book down to a manageable length, they cut some major animators from the book,or only acknowledged them briefly).

1595141715|5.0|This book is phenomenal, and I could not put it down!! Very rarely do I like a persons first book, with this much enthusiasm!! I loved it, and I think, that if people read this,(ecspecially teenagers), it would help awareness of suicide. Also, to help people recognize signs of suicide! This book could help people be aware and to reach out to someone, and show that person, people really do care.I think this should be a requirement for pre-teens to read, and its a compelling read, that teenagers would actually like to read. It's so easy to identify with this. I have a twelve year old and a fourteen year old, and I am going to make sure they read this book, or I will read it to them. I am so amazed, and I would love to meet this author! He is an amazing man, to have so much wisdome and knowledge, and to put it to something that will reach millions! I definitely would recommend this, and I am telling all the parents and teens I know to read this, and they will be just as amazed as I am! Thank you Jay Asher, you have given the world a gift!<br />Jessica Frizzell, Missouri!
0307341569|4.0|I liked this book.  I do agree there is a fair amount of violence and even some disgusting parts (dogs poop in the house and no one cleans it up)and the main character takes a while before you like her (I eventually did like her.)      The book was pretty tight - very engaging and I cared what happened to the people.  A thoroughly good read.  I did feel the last 100 pages jerked a reader a round a bit and dragged out the truth a little too slowly but the ending was pretty believable and overall I'd rate this book high on readability - is it a must read - if you are looking for something a little edgy and a \\"crime novel\\" then yes, this should be near the top of your list ;)

1439138311|4.0|This doesn't live up to 'Blackwater Lightship' or 'The Master' but is yet another gem by this incredible writer. I wondered whether Toibin would really be able to write about Brooklyn (and the US) and get it right, but I think he did. A fine book by an incredible writer.
B000NY12LO|3.0|A lot of people I've talked to just LOVED this book. I thought it was OK. It is sad from the very beginning and maybe that is why I just had a hard time really getting into it. I liked My Sister's Keeper much better and really was hoping for more. However, I would still recommend you read this book. Especially if you have teenagers.
0312330537|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but was disappointed by the ending. It all wrapped up a bit too neatly. I also thought(hoped)it would cover Lin's recapture, final prison time, and reunion with his family. (That may be in his next book!) However, I still gave it 4 stars since most of it is an engrossing, interesting read, and provides a wonderful view into India and its people. In fact, a native of India recommended this book to me.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|Yeah, OK, Ledger and Bale were both good, and I always like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.  (Frankly, though, I liked Jack Nicholson's \\"Joker\\" better -- mainly because he really did JOKE and laugh, whereas all Ledger does is kill people!) But I agree with what many other people said:  the movie was WAY too long, the plot made no sense, I couldn't understand Gary Oldman, and the amount of violence was absolutely ridiculous.  The first hour was better than I expected, but then it was as if the producer said, \\"Wait a minute!  There haven't been enough explosions or car-chases!\\"  And then you get at least 40 minutes of almost non-stop explosions and car-chases, interspersed with numerous killings.  I say \\"at least 40 minutes\\" because we turned it off after about 2 hours.  Unless you like mindless action and violence and don't give a damn about plot, characters or INTELLIGENT movies, skip this!
0061231401|5.0|As always, Mr. Rollins provides a fast-paced and easy to read saga. In this case, it's the Sigma force going after the Doomsday key. Won't spoil what it actually is.<br /><br />There were plenty of twists and turns in the plot, and I like that Senchan (Seychan?? sp?) is back. Also, he stuck to the story rather than going too deep into the backstories of the major characters. He refers to their back stories just a bit, but it doesn't bog down the narrative.<br /><br />As always, the book is very well written with outstanding editing. If I ever get published, I could only hope for as good of editing. He keeps his POV's clear and does no head hopping. The writing style is easy to read and it flows nicely. There was not one place where the action or back story bogged things down.<br /><br />This is an excellent summer read, or winter read, for that matter, and my only problem is that I have to wait about a year for the next one. Highly recommended.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Absolutely love Planet Earth!! Highly recommend - everyone should watch this series. Not something you get tired of, you can watch it over and over again.

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Michael Jackson was a very talented artist.  It's a known fact that his father was a very serious perfectionist and pushed Michael Jackson from when he was the age of five.  This was something that led to nightmares, and a scar that probably never healed.  However, we have benefitted from it greatly.  Let's just hope that his father doesn't do the same to Prince Michael, Paris, or Blanket (and there are rumors that the evil Joseph Jackson has discovered performer potential in at least one of these kids).<br /><br />There are a couple of different versions of this album, there's the international release, and the U.S. release, which is the one I have.  From what I understand, the international release has the shortened versions, while the U.S. release primarily has the full versions.  Some of the tracks are in different orders, but all of the songs except for three are the same.<br /><br />No matter which version you have, the album still shows the full history of Michael Jackson, skipping the first ten years and the last seven years of his life.  The album shows all of the different sides to him.  It shows the child side, the more political side, the soft side, the more funky side, the disco side, et al.<br /><br />Several people will complain that a few songs are missing, but that's what compilations basically are.  All of the really important songs are here.  However, I would definitely suggest putting \\"I'll Be There\\" on it, but at least they put \\"Ben\\" on it.  At least one of the slow songs from the early years is here.  Several people have suggested putting \\"Scream\\" on it, others have commented on \\"Say Say Say,\\" but \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough,\\" \\"Man in the Mirror,\\" \\"Heal the World,\\" \\"ABC,\\" \\"You Are Not Alone,\\" \\"Bad,\\" \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),\\" and \\"She's Out of My Life\\" are all on it.<br /><br />This album is a great album by a great entertainer.  Let's just hope that his father doesn't do what was done to him to his children, no matter how much we could benefit from it.  Michael Jackson wished for his children to have happy lives, being loved and cared for, not being pushed to go beyond their limits.<br /><br />R.I.P.

B000ZLFALI|4.0|Any musical, Beatles, or romance lover will enjoy this interesting, creative rendition of all the famous Beatles songs into a story. The songs truly come to life when situations are put to them. The covers of the songs are just as good as when Ringo, Lenon, McCartney, and Harrison did them in the 60's. Jim Sturguss is an amazing actor and singer. He takes over the movie with his Liverpool accent, and inviting eyes. Evan Rachel Wood could of been a little more into her part, but her bad acting is covered up with Sturgesses amazing performance.

0439813786|5.0|I discovered The Invention of Hugo Cabret when doing research on the Caldecott winners for my Illustration class. It was so wonderful, not only did I spend all of Sunday afternoon glued to this book, it also inspired me in my chosen profession of Illustrating children's books.     I found it most helpful to have read the introduction and visited the  website to get an in depth look at how the book was created, before I actually read the story. It's very complex, the way it is put together. As an older adult artist of 61 years, I was excited by the beautiful illustrations and descriptive story telling. This book made me feel fortunate to be the age I am and still be in touch with the child within.     One thing is for certain, the Caldecott Medal is not given out because of popularity. It is awarded by a very select group of jurors as described here by Wikipedia:  The Caldecott Medal is awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association, to the artist of the most distinguished American picture book for children published that year.   One of the criteria being:  The book must be considered for the artistic technique employed; pictorial interpretation of story; appropriateness of style of illustration to the story; delineation of plot, theme, characters, setting mood or information through the pictures; and recognition of a child audience.

B000SSPL0I|4.0|This set (dating from 1955) has managed to achieve something close to classic status and is probably one of the best recordings around of a work which contains many fine numbers and parts, but the overall cogency of which is a little questionable. Among its virtues is of course the brilliant performance by Tebaldi, probably the best Leonora around. On the other hand, Simionato's Preziosilla is not her best performance, being somewhat unsteady and ungainly (though it isn't bad). Something of the same polarity can be found among the male characters - Bastianini is excellent as Carlo, whereas del Monaco's Alvaro is brash and unsubtle, mostly loud. The orchestral playing is lively, however, and Molinari-Pradelli has an admirable grasp of the score, and the sound quality is very fine for its age as well, spacious and clear. Among the main competitors are the fine, but slightly cut Serafin set and the Schippers (which I haven't heard), and for a fine modern recording, I'd go for the very good Sinopoli one - which in the end must be said to be the first choice among the ones I am familiar with.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|I won't go into the details of the plot of the picture. I just want to mention that the Blu-ray version of this film is the best I've seen it in years! The HD picture quality is amazing -- more clarity, depth, and richness of color. The Blu-ray also retains the original theatrical aspect ratio. (Even though the film was shot at 1.33:1 it was matted at 1.85:1 for movie theaters.) In the full screen version presented on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD, helicopter blades can be seen at the top of the screen during the opening credits. Obviously that was accidental.<br /><br />Most of the extras are from the older DVD version, but there are a few new extras on the Blu-ray too, like the commentary from the cinematographer. Overall, if you're a fan of this film, the Blu-ray version is highly recommended.

During return trip, THIS GPS receiver received accurate location lock within 45 seconds, and kept solid lock on location for the ENTIRE 1200+ miles with ONLY loss along 3 miles stretch of I-65 just near Huntsville, Alabama, and during that short stretch of road, NONE of the GPS receivers could hold a location lock, and my handheld GPS was ALSO losing satellite signals...  Acted like that short area of I-65 may be affected by some RF noise causing many, if not all GPS systems to have nearly impossible satellite reception in that area.<br /><br />But even in that stretch of I-65, this GPS receiver for my computer was quicker at regaining satellite lock and location fix than either my handheld or the other computer GPS receivers I had with me to try.

The crowd is dry, then the crowd is wet,and then dry again. It's night then day and night again. I wish they took all the footage including all the extras and just presented the whole festival as a historic documentary in the order that it happened. Maybe for the 45 year anniversary they'll do it right.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The seller shipped the merchandise promply and it arrived in good condition. This is my first time using Amazon and I was very impressed.
B001TOD92C|5.0|I was skeptical about watching this movie. First, because I was worried that I would be too distracted by Mickey Rourke's plastic surgery to be able to enjoy the film. Also, I thought that it would be a lot about wrestling, which I have no interest in. But, being an Aronofsky fan, especially because of [[ASIN:B00004Y6Q5 Requiem for a Dream (2000 Film)]], I decided to take a chance, and I'm so glad that I did.<br /><br />You don't have to like or even watch wrestling to enjoy this film. But, strangely enough, watching those scenes was like watching a car accident, hard to ignore. As much as the sport is supposed to be \\"fake,\\" there is nothing fake about someone throwing you out of the ring, using a staple gun on you, or cutting your own forehead, and having blood pour down your face. I felt like those scenes were jaw-dropping, and I had to look away several times, and then look back to make sure that he was okay.<br /><br />I know that I don't need to regurgitate the storyline here, because there have been so many great reviews before me. I was suprised at how amazing Mickey Rourke's acting was. I really felt everything that Randy said and did. I had so much sympathy toward him when he was trying to reconcile with his daughter. Even though I didn't feel Evan Rachel Wood's acting was quite up to par as the others, I could sympathize with that whole situation about how he was never a good father. When he was trying to connect with Pam, the aging stripper, who, even though looks gorgeous in her 40's, you see that she had a very similar job as his. The older you get, the more the job takes a toll on you. You become addicted to that lifestyle. It was almost as if it was their \\"drug of choice.\\" They had that in common which is probably why they connected so much.<br /><br />I thought about the movie long after it was over, and I cried more than once. It was so raw and real, that you couldn't help to feel sorry for all of these characters, lost in their own way. People make mistakes, and even though he kept making them over and over, I still felt that he was a good person, and I admired him for trying.<br /><br />Highly recommended!hough he kept making them over and over, I still felt that he was a good person, and I admired him for trying.     Highly recommended!
B001FB55H6|1.0|I wasn't looking forward to seeing Watchmen in the theater.  However, a friend wanted to see it with me, so I figured why not.  Little did I know it would move me enough to come out of retirement and offer my two cents.  So, here goes.    Firstly, if Alan Moore says Watchmen can't and shouldn't be filmed, that's good enough for me.  Alan Moore is a visionary and literary genius.  I am not.  Nor is ANYONE in Hollywood or the people who are willing to see the credibility of Comic Books as an art form sacrificed so they can be entertained for two plus hours.  You know who I'm talking about -Fanboys, the same tools that are simple enough to wonder why Alan Moore hasn't written a sequel to Watchmen and couldn't wait for the sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.    You know, carriers of the same gray matter that embraced the last three (hell...four) Star Wars movies simply because they have George Lucas' name on them - never mind they were boring, incomprehensible, rife with embarrassing, groan-inducing dialog and largely unwatchable.  Along with Bryan Singer and Kevin Smith, Zack Snyder has now fleshed out the holy trinity of comic book geek-related cinema \\"do-no-wrongers.\\"  No doubt Fanboys have taking to referring to him as \\"Zack\\", as though he'd bother to learn their names.  They sound like teenage girls talking about Zack Efron.    Basically it's all Trekkie mentality (and no, not \\"TrekkER\\"...you weirdos aren't butching up your nickname on my watch) -a school of thought which dictates as long as there's product to be had, it's good, especially if it is self-referential and self-reverential.    Anyway, I figured out a while ago (around the release of Tim Burton's Batman), that although I am a fan of the source-material and it's kinda cool to see living people play out a comic book story, that doesn't mean it should happen, nor does it make it automatically good.  Even if they get some of it right, like Richard Donner did with Superman's origin, comic book moviesare common these days and some just flat suck.  Bryan Singer's Superman, the first attempt at a Hulk movie, Ghost Rider, Catwoman, The Spirit (Frank Miller can obviously do wrong) and now Watchmen come to mind, not to mention every Batman film with which Tim Burton was even remotely involved.    But, I digress...    Watchmen, as directed by Zack Snyder is no less than an empty-headed Fanboy fetish film for con-season circle-jerks.  It is an exercise in just how bad things can go wrong when a trendy action director with zero facility with actors is granted access to a historic character piece.  Snyder was a director out of his milieu.  Did you see Benjamin Button?  Same thing.  Call me pretentious if you want, for I care not (Mark sniffed).  Zack Snyder had no business directing Watchmen.  It was boring, ill-paced and devoid of impact.  It had little emotional resonance, zero suspense and even less thrills.    Watchmen was needlessly violent, confusing (and I've read it three times so it shouldn't be), amateurish in its storytelling sensibilities, unoriginal in technique and execution and an insult to what Alan Moore was trying to accomplish with Watchman as a story meant to only be told in comic book form.    The choices in popular music were silly, unoriginal and made little cinematic sense. Snyder did not gracefully pace to them or cleverly cut to them.  He just played them, as though the atmospherics of contrast between scenes of destruction and Nat King Cole would \\"just work\\" in an ironic fashion.  And how completely of unoriginal of him to try.  John Woo he most certainly is not.    Well, it doesn't \\"just work\\".  Flight of the Valkyries?  Was Snyder serious with that?  Look.  that song is PERMANENTLY associated with Apocalypse Now as a storytelling element.  Was it supposed to be funny?  Because the audience was laughing.  Does he even know how to be original?  How hamfisted can a director be before I laugh when I'm supposed to feel chills, laugh at his ineptitude?    The plot revelations had no weight.  As a viewer, I did not feel any sense of world crisis in the atmosphere, no one's death made me feel much and even on the one occasion a scene was played and cut for laughs, it wasn't remotely funny.  I guess the fact that I neither fell asleep nor walked out should be considered a compliment.    Snyder did get the Minutemen right, from a visual sense anyway.  It was cool seeing cloth costumes for a switch and the retro-look of the individual Minuteman origin/backstory snippets rocked.  However, mere snatches of visual accuracy do not necessarily a wholly good interpretation, or even a good movie make.  Watchmen is loaded with visual accuracy, unfortunately it doesn't add up to much.  It's supposed to be a period film, circa 1985, but nothing suggested it really -certainly not the music, the obviously-made-with-21st-century-technology costumes or set design.  Sure, he had 99 Luft Balloons playing but like most of the music choices it was a distraction not a complement to the goings-on.    As far as characterizations go, Doctor Manhattan is completely wrong.  Does he sound ominous, detached or creepy?  Nope, Snyder decided Dr. Manhattan, a man one with the universe, has Billy Cruddup's voice ...and it's not just a bad choice, it's a clueless one.  The weightiest character in the book, the one fraught with irony and philosophical contradiction and sporting the least humanity, a man decimated and reassembled with the power of a star sounds like Billy Cruddup?    Um, no.  He should sound soulless, without even a grasp of the concepts of humanity, compassion or remorse.  His voice should sound hollow, devoid (I know what you're thinking and, no, I don't mean George W. Bush).  He should sound like 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL or Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter.    How could Snyder miss such a no-brainer?  Is he high?    It is a choice reminiscent of the Paul Dini Superman cartoon with Tim Daly voicing both Superman andClark Kent - his voice fits neither character and its register does not change with his identity.    Then there is Silk Spectre, far more powerful, confident in her sexuality from the get-go and, well, a murderer of street trash (via a gleeful knife to the neck).  Three things she never was in the comic.  Her character registers little baggage and is little more than a sex toy in this movie.    When confronted by a gang of street toughs, she and the Night Owl evidently enjoy the violence they are forced to participate in, which, again, is nothing like the way they acted in the published work, hesitant, shaken and a tad remorseful.    Ozymandias is clearly the mustache-twirling villain from scene one instead of hiding behind his image as fey narcissist, rendering the revelation of his involvement, well, uninvolving and not a shocker in the least, a non-stunner.    The Comedian they got right, but as a character he is more a force of nature than macguffin in the movie.  The whodunit aspect of Watchmen barely exists other than when Rorschach's voice-over tells you it does.  It's not an element sensed in the air and there's zero suspense -and not just because I knw how it ends going in, as the ending was changed (some thing Fanboys have no problem with because, dammit, it just looked so much like the comic.  There is no \\"Oh, my God\\" feeling when Ozymandias comes clean.  Unto his own, The Comedian and his backstory are interesting, but as part of the main plot line, he's just kind of there when needed.  He is the most well-developed of any of the characters in Watchmen, but that is not saying a whole lot.    Rorschach they sorta got right except he seemed possessed of super-powers of agility and durability he does not have.  There were blows delivered to him by Ozmandias that should have either killed him or paralyzed him.  Again, what looks cool and what plays are two different things.  Rorschach looked cool being tossed about but it was over-the-top violence no man could recover from.    Also, why is Rorschach now portrayed a sadistic dealer of punishment, reveling in violence instead of one who simply uses it as a tool, with neither a second thought or joy?  He displayed too much satisfaction doling it out.  Rorschach's heart rate should NEVER rise.  This Rorschach's obviously did.  Now he'll joyfully and repeatedly whack you about the skull with a butcher knife instead of casually strolling away as you burn, chained to a cast-iron stove, having forgotten you already.  A pure sociopath, Rorschach doesn't wallow in others' pain, he's indifferent to it.  It gets the job done.  It is a tool, an end to a means.    Directors always point out that things change in the translation to screen.  I defy Zack Snyder to state why Rorschach now cleaves skulls with glee.  Like the ending, It is a scene changed for absolutely no structural reason.  It was gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence.  It was a needless decision and anathema to the character of Rorschach.    It was never clear whether the actors playing Nixon, Pat Buchanan and Ted Koppel were intentional or unintentional awfully done impersonations or intentional or unintentional awfully done caricatures. Either way they were insipid and ill-conceived. Both the makeup artist and person responsible for casting them should have been fired.  Better yet, the characters should have only appeared in silhouette or bathed in shadow in the first place.  This Nixon could not even move his upper lip and none of the actors sounded or looked like those they were meant to represent in the least. They looked about as convincing as Jon Voight was when he played Howard Kossell in The Greatest ...in other words, not at all convincing and rubbery.  What's more, the entire scene was a visual ripoff of Dr. Strangelove, just as Ridley Scott's camera angles and permeated the film.    Sure, as I've noted a zillion time that Picasso once said \\"good artists borrow, great artists steal.  However, there's a difference between an homage and a lack of original storytelling vision.  Snyder fills images interestingly enough, it's the storytelling, pacing and characterization skills that are missing from his movies.  In other words, he hasn't earned the right to steal because he's yet to do anything original.    So they managed a few interesting translations of elements of character and more visuals evocative of the source material than one could hope for and yet it still did not seem to work as anything other than something easily-pleased Fanboys will enjoy.    Here's why.  Here's the venom Alan Moore spoke of.    As published, Watchmen was a work designed to both implement and showcase the finer intricacies of comic book storytelling using techniques unique to the medium and if Alan Moore says it can't be filmed, it can't be friggin' filmed. Period.    As I stated above, the man is a literary storytelling genius and there's what...maybe a dozen of those guys alive at any given time in literary history?  Alan Moore CHOSE not to become a genius film director because doubtless, as a storytelling genius, film would likely be childs' play for him.  That and he, himself has stated he finds comics a richer medium to work in.    So, no Ridley Scott wannabe (no less than 3 of Scott's TV commercials from the 80's have cameos and it would not surprise me if Snyder once worked at Scott Free Productions under Ridley and Tony Scott) is going to pull it off no matter how much frame-pulling, freeze-framing, washed-out color, jump-edited 90's GAP-ad pyrotechnics he deploys. Anyone who witnessed the derivation-fest of post-Heston, toga and sandals homoerotica that was 300 could see it coming.  He's all flash that will one day be passe'.  In cinema, it's the story that must hold up over time, otherwise a films' original visual merits will wash away with time.    Snyder is not a visionary in the least or original enough to steal from truly great artists of cinema.  He is a ripoff artist.  With its scenes of wheat-field family reunions, pseudo-wannabe Shakespearean political machinations and glycerin-soaked abs, 300 was the single most derivative movie in recent memory, nothing more than Gladiator-in-panties filtered through the eyes of a far lesser \\"talent\\".    See, Zach Snyder isn't an actor's director or even one I consider a filmmaker.  Like McG, he is an MTV level video director of digitally-processed images, chiefly concerned with imagery, and in Watchmen's case, largely unoriginal imagery.  He thinks replicating the comic is enough to successfully adapt the movie and it's not.  There is more to it than that.    Watchmen is a character piece/whodunnit and a costume drama with snatches of action and Snyder and his writers (David Hayter, actually credited among the many writers of the X-Men films and first-timer Alex Tse don't seem to understand that just because you copy what's on the comic book page doesn't mean it's going play onscreen.    Comics and film are two distinctly different mediums with sensibilities that must accommodate one another when translating one medium to the other.  The Hollywood translation of The Great Gatsby is probably the most glaring example of this rule of screenwriting 101, as it too is an awful film which drew dialog and imagery directly from the page.    I cannot imagine what people who have never read the comic must think whilst viewing Watchmen.  (I do know of a couple of people completely unfamiliar with Watchmen who saw it.  They were bored senseless and walked out.)  Primary characters disappear for nearly an hour, many of the briefer flashback scenes are clumsily paced and placed and not a single character is a pop culture icon.  It's like a series of inside jokes poorly executed.    So much that should have been cool, that was intended to be cool, just wasn't...and this movie, like it's author has made perfectly clear, should never have been attempted.    But no. Fanboys, in their endless devotionto people they don't know, will embrace it simply because Snyder \\"did good\\" translating 300.  That's how fanboys roll.  Think about it.  They actually believe Kevin Smith has contributed something memorable to the comic book storytelling medium simply because he used to be one of them.  If they think Smith and his chatty Batman, over-written Daredevil, no-show Bullseye, needlessly and sadistically trauma'd Black Cat and cliché Green Arrow are actually relevant, no doubt Fanboys see Zack Snyder as the second coming of David Fincher (Ain't it Cool News' primary over-worshipped \\"visionary\\").    Just as Charleton Heston labored cluelessly through (and later -after the director and writer enlightened him -lived homophobically in denial of) some of the gayest scenes in cinema history, just as dimbulb fans live in denial of the outright crappiness of post-Kirshner Star Wars movies, the laughable second and third chapters of the Matrix franchise and character-bastardization of Bryan Singer's Superman and Lex Luthor, these fanboy tools will embrace the mess of half-witted filmmaking that is Watchmen, further empowering Snyder and licensing him to more shots at ruining other, relevant comic book works.    There was a time when I would have been afraid he might get hold of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, but Frank Miller himself already rendered moot any claims to art DK once had by scrawling his own Godawful sequel for a lousy buck.    Bottom Line: It is not that Watchmen was only a bad interpretation of Watchmen, it's that it was just very bad filmmaking by a very predictable, unoriginal and trendy MTV director, one whose style has all the subtlety of a linebacker.    So, Watchmen just wasn't what I consider to be a good movie.  Sure I may have gotten a tad harsh on Snyder or Fanboys above, but there have been plenty of movies I thought I'd never like that surprised me because they turned out to be well-made movies with well-told stories.    That being said, I hope Zack Snyder stays away from Marvel Studios.  I don't want Zack Snyder anywhere near any property that matters, or matters to me, ever again.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Animated movies keep getting better & better. This is a movie that I can honestly say I bought for myself. I didn't buy it for my kids. I bought it for me. We rented this a long time ago & I was thoroughly taken by the story. A rat being told he couldn't be anything more that what his family said. Him longing for better & finding himself alone in a big city. And against all odds, he finds a way to perform his true passion...creating fine culinary delights.....and becoming who he knew he would be. Yes, my kids like it too but I just found this wonderful to buy (at a good price) and I'll watch repeatedly...even by myself.
0307454541|1.0|This was the July selection of my book club, and since I read every book that my book club members select, I read this one. From beginning to end. The beginning was difficult to get through. The ending was a letdown. The middle part, the actual search for Harriet Vanger, was somewhat interesting, but the two main characters were unappealing. I read that the original Swedish title of the book was Men who Hate Women. That says it all. Not entertaining to read about all these sadistic men.

B00005A0RI|4.0|I love this album, it is so romantic in the best sense of the word!  It is absolutely beautiful!  The tunes are mostly ballads  but it has a Latin pulse to it and is very good listening from a jazz as well as a non jazz perspective.  Haden plays beautifully as usual.  Would give 4 and a half stars if I could....I only give a select few albums a 5 star.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|In the early centuries of the Christian era, the faith Christ began with a small band of 12 conquered the greatest empire.  Not with swords and chariots but with love.  The introduction to the movie summarizes the rest.  And in this film we see all the key players in that drama, Paul, Peter, and the Christian martyrs who shamed the empire and eventually defeated her with the love of their Lord.<br /><br />The title (of the book on which the movie is based) comes from the story that Peter was leaving Rome at the beginning of the persecutions under Nero when he encounters Jesus going toward the city.  He recognizes Jesus and asks \\"Quo vadis, Domine?\\" or, \\"Where are you going, Lord?\\"  Jesus answers that he is going back to the christians Peter was abandoning to \\"be crucified again.\\"  Peter is devastated by the implication and returns to Rome to also accept martyrdom.  When Christ's body (his church) suffers, so does he.<br /><br />The love stories that interweave the story are tasteful and truly bespeak something more than the current typical hollyweird portrayal of love as an outlet only for physical gratification.  The martyrdom scenes are also done without being overly graphic yet conveying the horror just the same.  This is one of those rare films that does not shrink from the dignity of man as too sappy or childish for adults.  It is a great Christian film without being preachy or simplistic.<br /><br />Some (particularly those of a fundamentalist persuasion) have objected to the \\"Christian\\" label being applied to this film since the Bible does not mention Peter being in Rome.  But one of the earliest works of the Church in Clement I's (bishop of Rome) epistle to the Corinthians written shortly after the events portrayed in this movie mentions the martyrdom of both Peter and Paul in Rome.  That epistle also mentions those two apostles as the leaders of the church in Rome.  Other historical documents concur with Clement.  This film is about as historically accurate as any film of the early church and very entertaining at the same time.<br /><br />Very well done.lm of the early church and very entertaining at the same time.      Very well done.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|A fascinating film documentary of a signicant historical event.  Funny, poignant, and compelling.  The musical performances varied in quality.  Country Joe and the Fish, The Who, Santana and Jimi Hendrix were the standout performances.  I know The Who were not that happy about the show, but given they went on around sunrise it speaks more to the quality of what they were capable of at that point in their history.  I loved the announcements and audience interviews. Obvious accomadations were made to get the quality of sound and video up to Blu-ray snuff but well worth the editing in the end.

0756405890|5.0|Simply and shortly put, this is one of the most well written and engaging fantasy novels I've read in a long time.  I'm somewhat willing to forgive bad writing in fantasy and science fiction, but was ecstatic that in this case I did not need to - its a really well written book.    But where are the sequels?  Despite its length, its almost a prologue.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|Generation Kill, much like The Wire, is an ensemble cast depicting a slice of time and events. Many have tried to politicize the story, framing it in terms of being too left wing, though the accurate depictions GI's dehumanizing the Other, as \\"Haji\\" would bely any such criteria for a bastion of a politically correct left. The story illustrates the initial 21 days of the 2003 American invasion of Iraq. It does not address the Iraqi experience with any nuance whatsoever, and that is not its scope. It shows the experience of a Recon Marine unit as seen through civilian eyes of an embedded reporter. It conveys the silliness of human error and capacity for greatness that embody all people, service men and women not withstanding. The story is also entertaining, with many of the characters idiosyncrasy being cast within a unit model, so one views all of these individuals relatively the same, until as time goes on you witness the individual personality of each come out by illustrating each one's boredom, response to atrocity and absurdity, and the conflict within ranks. Finally, it depicts the complexity of groupthink that often occurs within the upper echelon of military hierarchy, while portraying the 'grunts' as intelligent in their perceptions of what transpired and their frustrations with a finite incapacity to respond meaningfully.

B00192IV0O|5.0|This is the one of the best albums ever! Every song sounds varied and unique with booty-shaking club beats and lyrics about partying and getting crunk. The vocals sound great because they were done with Autotune. Who still ACTUALLY sings? Not many. All of you folks need to stop living in the past and embrace the current state of the music industry, which is booming! Also, if you like this album you should check out Coolio, Will Smith, Lil' Wayne, T-Pain, Akon and Afroman.<br /><br />Avoid crap like N.W.A, Wu-Tang, Tupac, the fat guy who got shot, Dr. Dre, Funkadelic/Paraliament, Marvin Gaye, James Brown and Otis Redding at all costs.
B00297FEUI|2.0|I love Hans Zimmer's music. I love the fact that there are clones of him out there (Mr. Jablonski being one of them)! To have a school like \\"Remote Control / Media Venture\\" that teaches the right way to immitate Hans Zimmer is brillant. But at some point, it's gonna hit a wall. After all, how many variations can you do on \\"Roll Tide\\", the superb theme Mr. Zimmer composed for \\"Crimson Tide\\" in 1995? Don't get me wrong, i love the fact that people with talent want to compose endless variations on Mr.Zimmer's themes. But one has to wonder, with so few notes of music existing, how many variations can there be?     The first Transformers, in terms of score, was a direct copy of \\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"The Rock\\" or \\"Gladiator\\". Even \\"Batman Begins\\". Nevertheless, it was powerful. Not original for one bit. But a guilty pleasure anyway. \\"Arrival To Earth\\" and \\"Autobots\\" were sooo fun to hum.    So for this second opus, Mr. Jablonski had the opportunity to be original. Now that he'd gotten our attention, he could have shown us that he wasn't just another clone of Mr. Zimmer, the teacher. That he could stand on his own, like John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams (other clones). Instead, he simply did a variation on his previous themes. You have to admit, though, that the first track \\"Prime\\" is very catchy. After that, it simply rotates around that new theme and the ones from the first film. So for those who don't know of Hans Zimmer and his clones, well those people will probably love this album and find it very powerful and melodic. But for those who know about film music, they will simply see this score for what it is: another product out of Mr. Zimmer's factory. Same sound, no originality but always fun to hum. Like a guilty pleasure.     But again, how long can they continue like that? It almost becomes fascinating all those variations on a same theme. It would be fun to make a compilation CD (which i did) on which you put all the themes by \\"Media Venture / Remote Control\\" thatsound like \\"Roll Tide\\". The latest entry being \\"Prime\\" from this score.

B000IONL40|3.0|Desmond Child is my favorite song writer. And he wrote some of the songs here. And he produced one heck of an album! After \\"Mutt\\" Lange, you want desmond Child to produce your CD. But he can do the best job in the world, i don't care. True fans will always wonder what \\"Bat 3\\" could have been with Jim Steinman producing it and writing it. If you know your history, you know that Meat's best works are with Jim Steinman. And if you hear some of the songs that Mr. Steinman had in mind for this album (\\"Braver Than We Are\\", \\"We're Still The Children We Once Were\\", \\"Speaking In Tongues\\"), you can't help but being sad.    Still, Desmond Child did an excellent album here and it's worth your attention. I even think he's a better producer than Mr. Steinman. But darn it, you still have to cry. Jim Steinman, where are you? Why are you keeping these excellent songs hidden? I hope you're not going mad and that you won't become this strange artist living alone and dying with so many songs unproduced.     In the meanwhile, do yourself a favor and try to find \\"Braver Than We Are\\" on the net. Listen to it and tell me you don't want to hear Meat Loaf sing it with Jim Steinman behind the wheel.    Way to go, Desmond. You still did an outstanding job!

B00004Y6O9|5.0|I once heard that even Frank Zappa was blown away by Eddie Van Halen's guitar magic.  I mean, before Van Halen, noboby shredded like this.  A few guitarist like Steve Hackett of Genesis used the two handed tapping technique, but this is the first time such extended techniques found their way into their proper place...Heavy Metal.  Heavy Metal is always known for its flash: take Jimmy Page and proto metal star Jimi Hendrix for example.  But this is the first time metal flashed brighter than lightning.  This is the first time metal became a true party music, which is in direct contrast to the gloomy lumber of Black Sabbath, or the blues swing of Aerosmith.  This music doesn't lumber or swing at all.  It's lean, straightforward, party-metal.    There are really two showcases here.  David Lee Roth was, and still is, the perfect embodiment of a pop metal front man.  His flare and charisma gave the music character and it gave it a personality unlike anything at its time.  His humourous, almost parodic showmanship would be copied by one hair-metal clone after another.  None of them, however, had the credibility or feel of Roth.  Maybe its because Dave wasn't just some pretty boy with a pretty face.  His gruff vocals and labido gave him a more down and dirty persona that would put most \\"cleaner\\" hair metal singers to shame.    A lot of the same could be said of the groups other figurehead, Eddie Van Halen.  His riffs, chords, and solos would be copied like crazy over the next decade by many faceless teenybopper metal-heads.  More importantly is the fact that he completely rewrote the books on guitar playing.  He totally redefined the role of the electric guitar in both rock and metal.  Whether he's pick scraping the crap out of the strings on, \\"Atomic Punk\\", or pulling off harmonics like nothing on, \\"I'm On Fire\\", or launching a full assualt on the shredfest, \\"Eruption\\", he clearly is the instrument's master and he let's us know it too.      This is not hair-metal.  Van Halen simply doesn't play it safe enough to be in the same boat as Bon Jovi.  And let's face it; if Van Halen were safe, they wouldn't be any fun.  No metal fan should be without this record.  Actually, any rock fan period shouldn't be without this masterpiece.  Van Halen would never sound this raw or amazing again.  1984, for example, was a great record in its own right yet it simply featured too many synths.  And after David Lee Roth left, and Sammy Hagar jumped on board, the band lost its edge.  This proved just how valuable Roth was to the group's sound.  Anybody with any interest in the genre should do themselves a favor and purchase this album as soon as possible.
0312944926|1.0|I utterly fail to understand how this story could ever have left the publisher's trash can, let alone been tagged as \\"pure genius\\" by Mr Nelson Demille.  Enough said, at times the book felt like reading a first time attempt of a 15 year old. Yes, it is that bad.    I have to give one thing to Mr Brown though - despite the lack of innate writing talent, he learned from the numerous deficiencies and through hard work has since become a better writer.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|The Woodstock Anniversary Blu-Ray disk rocked. The shipment was received earlier than expected. You gotta love that.     It was a trip down memory lane. The bonus songs and the extensive historical bonus material gives the movie you have already seen new life. Blu-Ray features allow you to arrange a play list of the many bonus songs to play in the order you like. Way cool    Highly recommended, particularly if you were alive to remember the times. The video quality is not as good as some newer movies. It is about the best you can expect, although it is probably as good as the source material would allow.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|I love Chris Cornell, I've been a fan of Soundgarden since the beginning, and I really liked Chris's first solo album.  This 3rd solo album was a annoying sounding hip-hop record.  Forget about rock and everything you thought you knew about Chris's style, it's gone straight out the window.  Timbaland messed up on this one too, bug time!  High-pitched, under-processed, cheesy, annoying hip-hop beats under Chris's over-processed, pitch-corrected, chorus-effected vocals.<br /><br />I hope he doesn't perform these songs in concert.<br /><br />A must not buy, unless you like that kind of 2009 over-limited hip-pop.
159448385X|5.0|This book is equally as good, and as haunting, as Kite Runner. This time the story is about two Afghani women. Life in Afghanistan is wretched enough, but to be a Muslim woman in Afghanistan can be lethal, especially after the Taliban come to power. This book is beautifully written and at times difficult to read, but it's also difficult to put down. Mariam and Laila are wonderfully-drawn characters that will stay with me forever. They made me know just how lucky I am to be an American woman, and how unfortunate life can be for Muslim women in Muslim countries. This book will break your heart, but it will also put it back together again. Highly recommended.

6305752672|2.0|I did not expect this tape to be like this. I expected better. But I guess thats what happens when you buy a WCW Tape from the Vince Russo \\"era.\\" If I could even call that run an era. Well anyways lets gets started shall we? All of the matches here are REALLY short. Here are the matches:<br /><br />1) Disco Inferno vs. Lash LeRoux<br />Honestly this match is no big deal. It is an average opener and what could you expect? Lash LeRoux is new and Disco carries the match. I give this match 1 and out of 5 stars.<br /><br />2) Harleam Heat vs. Filthy Animals vs. The First Family.<br />This match starts off pretty good and ends really chessy. In my opinion the ending ruined the match. This match gets 1 and 1/2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />3) Saturn vs. The Late Eddy Guerrero<br />This match is pretty good Eddy and Saturn go back and forth until Flair comes out and hits Guerrero! He knocks out Guerrero and the match ends in a DQ. It is still a pretty good match. I give it 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />4) Brad Armstrong vs Berlyn<br />Why do I have to rate this match? It sucks! I have no idea why it was even on this tape! The match only last 4 minutes  and 24 seconds! This match gets a 0 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />5) Rick Stenier vs. Chris Beniot<br />Honestly I am a huge Chris Beniot fan. I think this match could have been better but in my opinion I think Rick ruined it. The matches before this match were not impressive and I thought this match would wake me up. The only thing that was \\"ok\\" was the ending. Dean Malenko comes in and hits Beniot over the head with a chair. I even think the chair shot was disappointing! Malenko put no force behind the chair shot. This match gets 2 and 1/2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />6) Lex Luger vs. Bret Hitman Hart<br />I am a huge Bret Hart fan and I have a question. Why did Luger win this match? This match is alright...its nothing great but you cant blame Luger or Hart for that cause it was probably not there fault. Luger wins...and the match is only about seven minutes long. I give this match 3/5 stars.<br /><br />7) Sting vs Hogan<br />What the hell?! This is NOT even a match! Sting pins Hogan after Hogan just lays down for him. Why didnt they even Wrestle?! It is kind of interesting to see this but it still sucks! I want a wrestling match! This gets like -1/5 stars! They didnt do anything!<br /><br />8) Goldberg vs Sid Vicious<br />This match is horrible. The only cool thing in this match is that The Outsiders beat the hell out of Goldberg as he was making himself to the ring. Other than that this is supposed to be a \\"Blood match.\\" It is one of the worst Blood Matches I have ever seen! I do not even consider it a Blood Match because Sid got his butt kicked for most of the match! BUT it is a horrible match. Goldberg in my opinion was never impressive as a wrestler. You could clearly see at one point in the match that Goldberg was supposed to be \\"punching\\" Sid in the face. I know that wrestling is staged but you are supposed to make it look real. This match sucks and it gets 1/5 stars.<br /><br />9) Diamond Dallas Page vs Ric Flair<br />Finally! A pretty good match! Honestly anytime Flair is in the ring with anyone it is an awesome match! I dont care what anyone says! And DDP is a pretty good darn wrestler himself. With this said this is the BEST match of the night. They both stole the card. The match was back and forth and they both put a good effort. By the way is it also a Strap Match! Surprisingly DDP beats Flair! This match gets 4/5 stars.<br /><br />10) Sting vs. Goldberg<br />This match is a result of Sting saying that he did not come to Halloween Havoc for a night off. He challenges anyone in the back to a challenge and Goldberg comes out. This match is really short. It only last about 3 minutes! That is disappointing! What was Russo thinking? This match gets 1/5 stars. If it would have been a better match if Goldberg and Russo actually let Sting wrestle.<br /><br />Overall Review: If you a HUGE WCW Fan than you might like this Tape. Otherwise buy Halloween Havoc 1998. It is a heck of alot better! That tape rocks and ONLY has ONE crappy match! I really recommend trying to borrow this tape first to see if you like it. If you are a Huge Ric Flair or Eddy Guerrero fan then you will like this tape. Otherwise take my advice and invest your money on Halloween Havoc 1998. You will not be disappointed!an than you might like this Tape. Otherwise buy Halloween Havoc 1998. It is a heck of alot better! That tape rocks and ONLY has ONE crappy match!

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I've been a huge Madonna fan for nearly 20 years and I will continue being her fan, however, this is the first album that I thought actually stunk. The other negative reviewers comment on her trying to be young but I don't agree with that at all. Age is nothing but a number. The Rolling Stones and Tina Turner are still rocking in their 60s and look good doing it. Madonna also looks fantastic on stage and can still outperform people in their 20s! I think her collaboration here though with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake was so manufactured that she didn't sound authentic. The music felt really forced. Timbaland is so overrated as a producer. He works with everyone and his music sounds the same. Thats her mistake there. She may have been working with people who weren't so mainstream on her past few albums but at least it was quality work. A true Madonna fan will never care about how successful a \\"single\\" is on the chart. If her attempt was to get back on the charts, this failed miserably. I get the feeling that someone from higher up may have had a hand in guiding her in this unfortunate direction but I only hope her next album will stay true to her soul instead of this mess of an album. FYI, the only few tracks that I can say I \\"tolerate\\" are 4 minutes, Heartbeat and Miles Away.

B001FB55H6|1.0|The movie was fine, I'm sure the directors cut will be good too... what isn't cool is packing in an advertisement for $10 off the Ultimate 5 disc Collectors Edition which will be available at Christmas. They're not only double dipping you, they're telling you after you buy the product that you're being double dipped.    It's really not cool to slam fans like this... The 5 disc version will include the Tales of the Black Freighter intercut with the rest of the film. It will also have the Hollis Mason \\"Under the Hood\\" documentary and the motion comic.    So if you already bought those discs and you buy the movie you're pretty much SOL. You're getting triple dipped at that point.    Tell the movie companies that you aren't going to play their game. Pass on this preliminary edition, rent it if you want, and then buy the real 5 disc version when it comes out at Christmas.

0142437611|5.0|Saul Bellow needs little introduction.  This slight book, however, is not his most well known.  It may be the most accessible, a sip before diving into larger, more daunting works.  Despite its brevity, this story of a day in the life of Tommy Wilhelm packs punch.    Bellow is a master stylist.  He writes a paragraph as aesthetically pleasing as anyone:    \\"A long perfect ash formed on the end of the cigar, the white ghost of the leaf with all its veins and its fainter pungency. It was ignored, in its beauty, by the old man.  For it was beautiful.  Wilhelm he ignored as well.\\"    Three characters are most central to the story:  Tommy Wilhelm (formerly Wilhelm Adler), his father (Dr. Adler), and Dr. Tamkin.  Other characters are interesting and relevant, but the relationships between Wilhelm and his father and between Wilhelm and Dr. Tamkin are the focus.  When the story opens, Wilhelm has no job, an estranged wife who will not give him a divorce, two sons he rarely sees, more debts than he can pay, a strained relationship with his father, and three orders of lard.    The orders of lard are Wilhelm's first foray into the commodities market.  Wilhelm knows nothing about the market and so suffers considerable anxiety when the price for lard drops and the choice is between selling at a loss or waiting for a rebound.  \\"The psychologist, Dr. Tamkin, had got him into this.\\"  Tamkin and Wilhelm first met at a nightly gin game where Wilhelm \\"had never won.  Not once.\\"  Dr. Tamkin proceeded to convince Wilhelm that there was easy money to be gotten on the commodities market.  Wilhelm explained that he did not want to get rich, he just wanted \\"a little steady income\\".  Dr. Tamkin agreed to show him the ropes:    \\"Sure I will.  I do it regularly.  I'll bring you my receipts if you like.  And do you want to know something?  I approve of your attitude very much.  You want to avoid catching money fever.  This type of activity is filled with hostile feeling and lust.  You should see what it does to some of these fellows.  They go on the market with murder in their hearts.\\"    Of course, Wilhelm's cold father had, vaguely, warned him from taking Dr. Tamkin's advice, telling Wilky, as he calls the 40-something Wilhelm:  \\"He's interesting to talk to.  I don't doubt it.  I think he's pretty common but he's a persuasive man.  However, I don't know how reliable he may be.\\"    Wilhelm is preoccupied for most of the rest of the novel with precisely the question of how reliable Dr. Tamkin's advice is and with Wilhelm's relationship with his father, Dr. Adler.  Dr. Tamkin has Wilhelm's last $700.00, which Wilhelm desperately needs, in those three orders of lard.  Dr. Adler apparently does not have much love for Wilhelm.  If he does love his son, the love is outweighed by his disappointment in how Wilhelm has turned out.  If the commodities speculating does not work out, Wilhelm will have to ask his father for money, but he is not at all sure his father will oblige.    Bellow unfolds these plot lines with always sufficient narrative tension to pull the reader along, but leaving enough room for some excellent prose in service of some lofty ideas.  Wilhelm is trying to find his footing in the world as it crashes around him.  Bellow, in placing Wilhelm in this situation, raises the question of the place, of even the worth, of an ordinary man who makes mistakes.  Wilhelm's musings regarding his life purpose raise one of the more profound questions of the novel:    \\"Maybe the making of mistakes express the very purpose of his life and the essence of his being here.  Maybe he was supposed to make them and suffer from them on this earth.  And though he had raised himself above Mr. Perls and his father because they adored money, still they were called to act energetically and this was better than to yell and cray, pray and beg, poke and blunder and go by fits and starts and fall upon the thorns of life.  And finally sink beneath that watery floor -- would thatbe touch luck, or would it be good riddance?\\"    I cannot speak for Wilhelm, but for readers it would be tough luck if his character ever disappeared.  This is an easy read in that the characters are engaging, the prose is excellent, the narrative is interesting, and the pages are few.  However, Bellow does demand something of his readers, so attentive readers are particularly rewarded.  Bellow's is a writing to be savored rather than gulped.  I am sure most palates will find the novel pleasing, some will find it superbly so.

B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson plays an awkward father separated from his daughter due to a failed marriage.  When this daughter he adores is taken by users while she is in Paris, Neeson becomes a man with a mission.  Using fighting skills (equally choreographed to Bourne's IMHO) from his former life as a protector, he makes his way through the bad guys in this perfectly paced action flick.  While he's almost too super human, receiving few injuries, the film still delivers simply because Neeson is that convincing and owns the screen.  The camera is much more steady than in the Bourne series, which allows the fighting (and there is tons) to be seen more and appreciated like so many dances.  No blood.  Pretty clean.  The only thing lacking are extras.

0316010669|1.0|Most of the times I sit down to read books that are supposed to be holding a breakthrough idea or concept, I come away extremely disappointed and frustrated.  Again, Blink was one of those books.  It started with an interesting few pages and a plausible sequence of events that might equate to something new and original, but the book quickly fell into the trap of most of these types of concepts.  It expanded into areas that didn't meet the criterion of the initial premise and then attempted to stretch the concept to include these additional storylines.<br /><br />Blink is an attempt to show that humans have conscious and unconscious trains of thought.  And that some people have such a strong ability to make correct decisions without really thinking about it, that this unconscious decision making is a completely separate line of reasoning done by the brain in lightning fashion.  Gladwell starts with a statue that the Getty museum purchased.  Only a handful of people had misgivings about the authenticity of the statue.  And these people made the decision based on a \\"hunch\\".  Now that is interesting.  However, what we never find out is whether these people always are negative on a purchase like this knowing that it is unlikely to be authentic.  Or, that these people made this type of quick decision 10 times and were wrong 9 other times.  Instead, they are placed on a pedestal and a new concept is arranged around this theory.<br /><br />He then uses an example of a tennis coach that can quickly point out  when a player is going to hit into a double fault.  Whoa!!  Could it be as simple as this:  a tennis coach that seen a double fault eighteen gazillion times and by watching someone perform in a certain way, it triggers his normal memory decisioning tree?  But since he has it basically imprinted on this brain, he can do the inner calculations in nanoseconds?  Now the big disclaimer by Gladwell is that this coach can't really describe why he knows.  Is that really important?<br /><br />But then Gladwell moves to showing how using this \\"Blink-like\\" decisioning process can lead to bad decisions; especially when it comes to prejudices that we might have picked up over the years.  Gladwell never shows how to distinguish good from bad \\"blink\\" reasoning, so this reader is confused as to what this part of the book had to do with the first chapter.<br /><br />And then there is a chapter that includes a singer that should have made it based on the early thoughts of experts, but the singer didn't make it.  What is that supposed to prove? That the recording house didn't do their job?<br /><br />And where does Pepsi's \\"taste test\\" come into the equation?  This is a ridiculous example of cognitive or even subconscious decisioning - this is purely a reflex response based on tongue taste receptors.<br /><br />Again, we have an author that wrote one best seller and is now trying to pawn off an additional \\"new\\" concept on the public without any evidence at all.  Any author attempting to show something new would use real scientific method and would attempt to level the other parameters and hold them constant.  This author does none of that.  He just attempts to fit the round plug into the square hole and hope that no one is really watching too closely.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|With all the reviews focused on the subtitle quality, I'll reveal myself as a heathen who viewed the English dubbed version (oh no). Although I recognized the film as well shot and artistically realized, I found the beginning too slowly paced and deliberate in the way it unfolded. Once the film gets going it is a fascinating film to watch - very much unlike the norm yet familiar enough to appreciate and enjoy. The film gives you just enough info to hook you, but leaves unansswered questions (in that Euro-way) that allow the viewer to really become enmeshed in the film. Fans of vampire films will like the subtle and intellectual treatment of the subject matter.

0375826726|1.0|I have never written a review on here before but I feel compelled to write one about this book because it is so bad. Maybe it was just the fact that I was younger when I read the first two books, but I don't remember them being this awful.  I am 23 now and maybe too old to be reading this but I have trouble stopping a series before I have seen it through to the conlclusion.    Paolini does not lack in creativity as he has created a rather interesting plot line.  But the simple fact is that he is not a good writer.  Brisingr does not necessarily have all that much action but rather is filled with overly dramatic dialogue.  Paolini's attempt to showcase Eragon's emotional side is exasperating.  It is very predictable and not at all interesting  And I just wanted to highlight that Paolini is incredibly overdramatic.  Every time Eragon does something, he has to use all his willpower or all his skill in magic.  When Paolini could say something with a simple sentence, he has to make it more complicated or dramatic instead.  When you think about it, saying some of the dialogue out loud would sound ridiculous.    Add to that the fact that there are basically no limitations on magic or the ancient language and this book is just way too out there.  Do not read this book or start reading this series if you are over the age of 14.

B0015XHQTY|5.0|This is the third episode of the saga. The mould was established two films ago and the first variations were introduced in the second episode. Now we have the third episode and the variation is clearly defined.<br /><br />On one side the group of criminals are politically motivated, like some kind of revolutionary secret army that manages to steal a whole lot of state-of-the-art modern weaponry. On the other side the police who is completely impotent because of the political pressure that imposes women and at the same time a more civil or polite if not courteous way of dealing with criminals and crime. Ms Miranda again. Absolutely Shakespearian!<br /><br />That of course goes against the grain of what Dirty Harry considers as good police work. The pseudo-revolutionary group kidnaps the mayor of San Francisco, then demands a couple of million and then a helicopter to transport them to the airport where the money will be waiting in a plane that would be ready to take off.<br /><br />Dirty Harry is provided with a new partner after the killing of the one he had at the beginning and that new partner is a woman. She has to prove herself in the eyes of the famous Dirty Harry. She picks the challenge and she succeeds against all odds.<br /><br />This time what makes the police inefficient is the political pressures they are suffering from, and that crashes them down. The mayor is saved in extremis by Dirty Harry and his partner, but the partner is killed and the mayor survives for sure but deeply shaken by the method used to liberate him. The main criminal detaining him is purely, truly and authentically blown into smithereens by a rocket launcher just hardly one meter over the head of the Mayor.<br /><br />In this case it is your best friend who makes the police incompetent. The last touch of the film is the helicopter arriving and announcing the money has been collected and is waiting for \\"you\\" at the airport along with a plane on its loudspeakers just minutes if not seconds after the killing of the main criminal and the freeing of the mayor. It shows how far behind their own times these modernistic politicians can be.<br /><br />Your worst enemies are always your best friends.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUminal and the freeing of the mayor.

You don't need to be Indian nor Bengali nor Asian to appreciate Lahiri either. She writes about everyone; she writes about Bengali-Americans I guess because she knows what their names are, how they dress, what they eat, and how they call their parents.

0743497465|2.0|The opposite of 'graphic novel' is the 'text cartoon' and this is a brilliant example of that genre. It's a so-far-out-it's-almost-believable story, featuring F-14 fighters that can fly thousands of miles at supersonic speed without refueling, super-secret Delta Force warriors who can do anything, and kill anyone, including their own Intelligence Chief in downtown Washington DC, without a moment's hesitation, a Senator running for President that makes Lex Luthor look like a sentimental fool and a monumental government conspiracy that makes the Iran-Contra affair look like a padded expense account by comparison.<br /><br />The technological toys are right out of Star Wars: skis that work like snowmobiles, black helicopters that are invulnerable and invisible, goofy handguns that fire, yes, lethal snowballs, it goes on and on.<br /><br />Need to take a submarine under the arctic ice pack and drill a hundred feet straight up, and place a huge chunk of rock up there, and then seal the ice back up? No problem.<br /><br />If you take it all as a cartoon, then it's kind of good fun. As someone more perceptive than me said about \\"Angels and Demons,\\" part of Dan Brown's appeal is that you KNOW the story can't possibly be true, so you can dive right in without any of the normal concerns of 'willing suspension of disbelief.'
B001E75QGG|1.0|I have been an Indy fan since the first movie.  That absolutely ends with this movie.  This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen come out of the Lucas camp.  Yes, even worse than Star Wars: Phantom Menace.  They waited so long to come out with another title in this killer series, and when they do, it is junk.  I can't even imagine what they were thinking when they came up with some of this worthless material (the nuclear fridge, the killer ants, vine swinging with the monkeys, etc, etc, etc.)  This movie represents 122 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  As far as I am concerned, there are only 3 movies in the Indiana Jones series, and this one definitely isn't one of them.  Don't waste your time.

B001F7MSFW|5.0|The falling glitter of autumn leaves through holes in the ceiling accompanied Prince Nuada's grand entrance into his father's crumbling throne room after many centuries of exile. Nuada shows proper respect and announces his intention to take back the Elvin lands and declare war on humanity, but finds he must fight to the death; his father refuses to let go of the only honor his people have left -- their vigilance over the truce between human and the Shadowlands where faerie and other creatures dwell. What follows is one of the most exacting and well-executed fight scenes in movie history. Luke Goss and the staff of martial artists in this scene are brilliant. The soundtrack for this film is full of power, rage, and yet has moments of peace and comedy. I've played the music for this fight scene hundreds of times and never grow tired of it. The entire score is dramatic, full of pathos and despair, yet with an undercurrent that drives one to listen fully, hoping for the lilting promise of peace. One of my favorite films and much played; both score and film excel at guiding the listener/watcher's emotions. Ron Perlman, well-loved and remembered as Vincent from the series Beauty and the Beast, is at his Hellboy best, a kick-ass alpha who dotes on his equally kick-ass mate. The scene of Hellboy and Abe getting drunk and singing is a classic and not to be missed! Hellboy II: the Golden Army does not disappoint on any level.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Great film. This adaptation of Clive Cusslers book SAHARA made the story come alive. Just the right mixture of action and suspense to keep you riveted to the screen. The performances of Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, and William H. Macy were outstanding. I only hope that these guys get together and make many more of these movies. Clive... You are the best! Keep cranking them out buddy. As long as you write them, I'll buy and read them.
B00127RAJY|1.0|This sounded promising at first, and the reviews were great, but HOLD ON!      Anyone who knows anything about fitness knows that any strength-training routine requires muscles to rest for 48 hours in between sessions.  Even if you're just flinging around 5 lb. weights, your muscles are still being worked and will still need rest.  To recommend this video every day just isn't right.  I was a sucker though and figured \\"Hey, she's a trainer..if she's recommending it, it must be ok.\\" WRONG.  The concept of getting fit in 30 days sounds great and probably sells better than a 60 Day Shred.  Therefore, Jillian decided to market it anyway.  I fell for it and purchased the DVD.  I was already pretty fit and just wanted to tone up.  I had a few issues with this DVD...  1) A minute of warm-up before strength training??  No wonder so many reviews complain of soreness!    2) Going from standing to laying down, increasing heartrate, then reducing it... that puts a LOT of stress on the heart.  I think this would be dangerous for anyone using this DVD;  overweight or not.    3) Like I said before, the recommendation of doing this every day is absurd.  I stuck with it for 6 days straight until I didn't feel sore, I just felt injured.  My knees had random shooting pain throughout the day and an old whiplash injury from two years ago started to cause distress to my neck and back again.    4) Since your muscles don't have time to rest, they retain a lot of fluid.  I can imagine that a lot of people become frustrated when they see the number on the scale increase during the first week.  I gained 4 lbs. without changing my diet at all.  As soon as I stopped and let my muscles rest, the numbers on the scale went down immediately.  Beware.  I've tried a lot of fitness videos to add to my normal gym routine, and this one is just not practical.  I really don't write reviews unless I feel strongly about something.  Please consult a doctor before doing this routine.

B00000IQW3|4.0|[[ASIN:B00000IQW3 The Last Starfighter]]  With fond memory of this movie, I looked it up and ordered it.  Have watched it three or four times and when a friend visited while I was watching, I said she should see the opening scene which is delightful.  Upstart--we watched the whole thing, again.  The special effects are primitive by comparison to today's, but well done for the period and the whole of it continues to charm.

The epistolery form allows each character a strong voice and a platform to express their true feelings.  This style also allows for easy reading and convenient breaks.  The authors really made me want to travel to Guernsey, an area, I dare say, most of us are unaware even exists.  And it is a great book to convey what we all know -- reading books is a joy!
0740748475|5.0|This collection of my favorite comic strip of all time had been out for a few years before I finally put together enough disposable income to handle the hefty price.  It was completely worth it.  This collection is obviously intended for the serious Calvin and Hobbes fan, (guilty as charged) for kids or casually interested folks, I would recommend one of the other numerous collections.  It is a beautifully bound 3 volume boxed set that includes a lot of insight from the author, Bill Watterson.  For serious fans, it is a nice addition for your bookshelf, assuming your shelves can handle the weight.

I truly view person to person interaction in a whole new light.  First impressions play a larger role than we might think and oftentimes dictate the final result.  Mr. Malcolm Gladwell breaks down snap judgments and reveals how powerful a tool they can be in decision making.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially our representatives in government.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|It depends on what you like. If you like movies like Sniper and Rambo, then this movie is for you. I myself do like Movies like this. I has some decent graphics and can be a bit graphic. Not that I'm complaining, I love a good graphic movie. Its just not as graphic as Saving Private Ryan or the newest Rambo movie. But there is enough to have you say \\" That was just enough.\\" As for the acting, well its Mark Wahlberg. He is surprisingly better in it than some could suspect he is able. The script on the other hand leaves a bit to be desired if your into a movie for that, its a good thing I'm not. If you are looking for a basic movie with a sniper, a love interest, and bad guys you can spot a mile away with out a scope, then this movie is for you. Its a fun way to kill 90 minutes.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|After all the great reviews about Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Torino, I was really disappointed in the end result. Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  Playing the neighborhood crank (\\"Hey, get off my lawn\\"), in a neighborhood gradually changed around him; he is bigoted and ornery. Dealing with the death of his wife and the realization that all his neighbors are Hmong refugees, he is one angry old man. The problem is credibility. Eastwood's use of racial epithets doesn't seem to effect his neighbors one bit. Calling them every insult imaginable for a person of Eastern descent evokes smiles from the neighbors, except Grandma, who wastes no time telling him off. I thought I was watching \\"Walter\\", the Jeff Dunham character rather than Eastwood.<br /><br />The gradual shift from hate to a point where Eastwood actually gives his life to save the neighbor's kid is a powerful story line, but lost in the stereotypical way Eastwood acts (or fails to). I just don't think this movie lived up to all the hype. On a minor note, the Gran Torino in the title and mentioned significantly in the trailers is barely a plot line in the movie. Yes, he did help assemble the car; yes, the neighbor did try and steal it, but other than sitting outside and polishing it occasionally, it is not central to the plot at all. Sadly, this is one of the DVDs that I purchased that will most likely sit on the shelf without a repeat viewing for a long time to come.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|People who complain about this movie completely ignore the fact that this is a movie for kids and youth, and it is a wonderfully produced piece at that. I like Johnny Depp in this movie - and yes, he does play this weird and odd character - he is supposed to! I found him quite charming.      Kids love this movie!  And I like it, too.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|For the record, I am not a fan of Terry Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" fantasy series, so I didn't really expect to enjoy the TV adaptation.<br /><br />But to my surprise, \\"The Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season\\" turned out to be a surprisingly solid fantasy adventure series, with plenty of swords, monsters, lush New Zelaand scenery, sorcery and a likable young Prophesied Hero. It has some cheesy genre cliches at the beginning, but quickly evolves into a good-hearted, action-packed series.<br /><br />Young woodsman Richard Cypher (Craig Horner) rushes to help a Confessor woman who's being attacked by D'Haran soldiers -- and promptly finds himself accused of being her accomplice, and hunted by the D'Harans (who have made it through a magical barrier than cuts off the Westlands). When he goes to get help from the eccentric wizard Zed (\\"He's crazy! He talks to his chickens!\\"), he encounters the beautiful Confessor Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan) once again.<br /><br />The big reveal from Zed and Kahlan: Richard is a prophesied hero called a Seeker, who must use a magical sword to defeat the evil overlord Darken Rahl (Craig Parker). When his life is ripped apart by murder and treachery, Richard reluctantly accepts his destiny, and sets off across the Midlands with Kahlan and Zed.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Midlands have plenty of problems as well -- cruel D'Haran soldiers, Mord-Sith, magical maps, a boy who can read minds, some inconvenient magic shape-changing, the birth of a forbidden male Confessor, a string of impossible murders (including one seemingly committed by Richard), a malevolent wizard who is trying to create new Confessors, corruption in the Westlands, a plague created by Rahl, and a visit to the haunted tomb of an ancient Seeker bent on possessing Richard's body.<br /><br />In the course of their travels, the trio also learn that Rahl is searching for the Boxes of Orden, which can give ultimate power to the one who owns all three. Richard and his friends struggle to keep the magical boxes hidden, but a terrible mistake threatens to derail the Seeker's quest.<br /><br />It's not necessary to be a fan of Goodkind's books to appreciate \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" -- it's only loosely based on Goodkind's first doorstopper, and quite a few things are changed. Fortunately the TV show has plenty of merits on its own -- the lush scenery porn of New Zealand, intricate story arcs and standalone adventures, and plenty of swords'n'sorcery. You almost forget sometimes that it's yet another story about a prophecied hero.<br /><br />Each episode has plenty of action, usually involving Richard's acrobatic sword fights with D'Haran soldiers, and some fun magical twists (a talking doll). The writers also deftly avoid the Ye Olde Fantasye trap by penning dialogue that is breezy, straightforward and frequently amusing (\\"Remember, before chopping off the head, make sure the body is dead lest the head grow back.\\" \\"What lesson is THAT?\\" \\"Not a lesson, just something I once read in a cookbook\\").<br /><br />It does have some flaws, however -- the first two episodes are bogged down in genre cliches (Richard becoming a master swordsman overnight), cheesy moments (Richard's sword being struck by LIGHTNING?),  and too much slow-motion. Fortunately things even out after the beginning of the series.<br /><br />Craig Horner is absolutely perfect for the role, especially since Destined Heroes tend to be rather boring. Instead he perfectly portrays a down-to-earth goodness and kindness, which is tempered from innocence to maturity as the season winds on. But he brilliantly pulls off Richard's darker moments, including a horrendous Mord-Sith \\"training\\" session that leaves Richard broken, twitching and doe-eyed. He's also ridiculously gorgeous, and the directors take full advantage of that (the whole bridge-building scene).<br /><br />And Horner has amazing chemistry with Regan, who does a great job as a strong, butt-kicking woman who can enslave anyone with a touch. Bruce Spence does a wonderfully eccentric, lanky old wizard who frequently batters Richard with life lessons, and Parker makes a surprisingly human Evil Overlord, whose cruelty and manipulations are revealed to be an obsessive desire for \\"harmony.\\" Doesn't stop him from being deliciously hateable, though.<br /><br />\\"Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season\\" is wobbly at first, but soon becomes a well-acted fantasy series that stands on its own apart from Goodkind's fantasy novels. Definitely a good show, and promises to become better.rd who frequently batters Richard with life lessons, and Parker makes a surprisingly human Evil Overlord, whose cruelty and manipulations are revealed to be an obsessive desire for \\"harmony.\\" Doesn't stop him from being deliciously hateable, though.    \\"Legend of the Seeker: The Complete First Season\\" is wobbly at first, but soon becomes a well-acted fantasy series that stands on its own apart from Goodkind's fantasy novels.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|It is a nice remake of the old favorites-basically, the same good music we remember from thirty years ago, but re-recorded and remastered.  while one can argue, whether the actors playing main parts in the musical match musical talents of the ABBA members, and they probably don't, all the hits sound much fresher-and it is not just improved technology.  Maybe it stems from not having to prove anything-it sounds less forced. Great CD, interestingly, even our kids liked it (ditto for the movie), although they could not believe some  of the  lyrics :)

I finished `Gone Tomorrow' in 3 days (and I'm a slow reader). `Jack' just gets better and better.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for UP I was wondering how Pixar could mix a flying house, an old man and a boy into a story that would be interesting. I was pleasantly surprised by the ingenuity of the writers. The story of UP could be directed to quite a few people I know.  In a nutshell, the story is about being young-at-heart.    Carl Fredericksen and Ellie meet as children seeking adventure. They both want to follow in the footsteps of their hero Charles Muntz to a place in South America called Paradise Falls.  Muntz is a figure based on the explorers of the past and reminded me of the Lost World by H. G. Wells. Muntz has found a kind of lost world where a bird exists that is not found anywhere else.  Scientists scoff at Muntz that a skeleton of the bird is a forgery and the explorer sets off to prove himself.      As for Carl and Ellie, as the years go by they have to use their adventure money for other things. They get older and although they don't loose sight of their adventure they never manage to do it.  We watch in the opening minutes as Carl and Ellie grow older and Ellie become ill and dies.  On his own, Carl's neighborhood changes so that his home is boxed in by high-rise buildings.  When Carl is consigned to a retirement home he decided to take a different course and takes the adventure he had been putting off.     Carl's character as a curmudgeonly old man is forced to change as he inadvertently takes Russell, a Wilderness Explorer Scout, along for his adventure. When Carl gets to his destination he is challenged by the very Charles Muntz who inspired his adventure.  He has a choice to save a rare bird that Muntz has been trying to capture for decades (for his personal glory) or let Muntz take the bird. In making his decision, Carl grows back into the caring person he had been with his wife.     The characters are beautifully brought to life. Carl, voiced by Ed Asner, did remind me of Spencer Tracey with the square jaw and busy eyebrows.  He comes offas lovable under his hard exterior. Charles Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer made an effective villain with his single-minded determination to get his bird.  Then, there also are Muntz's faithful dogs, who have the ability to talk, that provide a lot of the comedy.  The chubby Russell is an endearing character for his stance of what is right and wrong.      I have read some criticism of Up that Carl and Muntz are too old for the roles they are taking, that it is impossible for a house to float along with thousands of balloons and the dogs flying airplanes is ridiculous.  Isn't that the essence of story telling? If we can't be delighted, at least on occasion, by the impossible and allow a little fantasy into our lives then we are the poorer for it.  The guys at Pixar have made another wonderful film that touches on life and shows us the possibilities.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Great series! Not 100% true to the book, but close enough.  Interesting sub-plots added.  Highly recommend!
0066620996|4.0|Interesting. A little fluff and a little bit of data to support the theme.    But apparently for many outfits this approach, which seems common sense, is breakthru info.    Not tough to absorb nor tough to emulate. But it's not a sure thing - fate plays a hand, no matter what Trump and Lee Ioccaca say.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|For someone who knows next to nothing about American history, this series was a real eye opener. One forgets that the French Revolution and the American War of Independence were so close philosophically, and so important in the history of democratic ideals that are now commonplace throughout the developed world. What I really liked about this series was the wonderful, nuanced performances of the two leads - Laura Linney is superb - and the gorgeous, spare, almost monochromatic cinematography revelling in the puritan taste for simplicity in dress, architecture, furnishings, and speech for that matter, especially compared to pre-revolutionary France's excess of richesse, frippery and duplicity. There is a tangible sense of the times portrayed: you can feel it in the silence (no phones, no TV, no radio, no traffic, no sirens, no motors) and in the sense of time passing so differently, journeys taking so terribly long, messages even longer to pass from one to another. And I also thought the casting was fabulous. George Washington was uncanny. Beautiful score, too. VERY highly recommended.
B0029358GM|3.0|Wilco's new album, like \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" before it, frustratingly straddles a line between collective band growth and nostalgic regression by showing love for records from the seventies. Whether or not the latter is a good or bad thing is up for you to decide. As for the former, I'll just say that I appreciate 2004's \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" even more with each passing day.    \\"Wilco (The Album)\\" has a lot going for it and lots going against it. I sincerely hope the band was not 100% serious when they decided to write a song about themselves as it is a pretty good start, sounding much like \\"Can't Stand It\\" from \\"Summerteeth.\\" Since I'm a fan of Nels Cline I enjoy \\"Bull Black Nova\\" though my wife tends to roll her eyes at what she deems to be \\"deliberate noise\\" without any feeling or emotion. \\"One Wing\\" feels like a counterpart to \\"Impossible Germany\\" from the previous album, which is a good thing in my mind. But the melody of \\"I'll Fight\\" just reminds me too much of \\"On and On\\" for comfort, and the lyrics don't help much either. And I just can't get into how \\"Everlasting Everything\\" tries so hard to be dramatic and epic-esque given how it has been assigned to close out the album.    As you can see, I refer to lots of previous Wilco songs to describe how certain songs sound on the new Wilco. Take this any way you want. To me, it means that Wilco is not treading unexplored territory anymore and perhaps we shouldn't expect them to. I know some will be comforted by the familiarity of the proceedings and give it five stars. That's cool. But I just can't do that. On more tolerable/charitable days I can listen to \\"You and I\\" and completely be at peace with the fact that Wilco are just doing what comes to them, even if it's not exceptional.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This workout is well paced and provides the perfect challenge!! Other prenatal videos I've purchaed have been very slow paced and boring which makes them difficult to get through. On the contrary - this workout is fast paced and lively - before I know it we're stretching and cooling down. So glad I own it - it's helped me keep active and in shape throughout my pregnancy.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I would still put all of their 80's albums ahead of this one, but the thrash is clearly back! This album is a welcome edition to the cannon after the Load/ReLoad/St.Anger era. Finally we actually hear Kirk's terrific skills once more. Other bands don't solo because they can't, Metallica shouldn't copy those rank amateurs. Granted, there aren't that many memorable tunes, but they all work well as part of the overall album and make for great \\"drive-fast in your car\\" music. My favorite was \\"All Nightmare Long\\", which easily could have been on \\"And Justice for All\\" (the video kicks butt btw.) I hope they keep up the good work. Give the album a chance, it gets better with repeated spins.
0061231401|5.0|James Rollins does not disappoint--ever!  While dealing with such important issues as genetically altered crops, feeding a hungry world, overpopulation, and researching ancient sites for plague viruses, he maintains a roller-coaster ride of adventure and plot twists. Intriguing characters develop depth while interacting in Rollins' world.<br /><br />I hate to read complete summaries of books in reviews.  They ruin the book for future readers. Suffice it to say, this is a great adventure book and thriller and has enough substance to be read again.  It's thought-provoking and forces us to make some decisions about what we would do to right the wrongs of the world.<br /><br />Don't miss this book.
031606792X|3.0|Well, I am a Twilight Fan after all and this book isn't going to change that.  As a whole, the entire series was so inventive and fun to read that I suppose just the fact that it HAD to end is hard enough in itself. That said, I spent the last few months trying to figure out how I felt about \\"Breaking Dawn.\\"  I tend to take a softer approach than some other reviews did with the attitude that it was just a fun series with characters I loved and decided to accept it.  Its not our story to re-write, as some reviewers wish, so I am going to appreciate it for what it is.      I got the impression that Stephenie Meyer loved her characters too much to let anything bad happen to them.  And that's a shame because the ending REALLY needed more resolution with a complete overthrow of the Volturi.  I got to the end and felt that it really DIDN'T end and she's now going to have to explain to us what happens in this endless life of theirs later on when the Volturi re-group and come after the Cullens again, now that they know what they're up against.    I know many people hated the book long before the end with the addition of the baby.   As a married woman with children, I didn't mind the baby being in the plot so much since it brought the characters closer to my own experiences than just what I remember from high school.  And as unbelievable as the circumstances might be around the whole thing, explored by many other reviews, I don't really care because the entire idea of Vampires is pure fiction anyway.  I don't need it to \\"work.\\"  I just need to care to keep reading.      If you can look past overthinking the details and you are in the mood for a happy ending and everyone to get what they want, you can still find something to enjoy about this book.  But it just might leave you feeling the same way you do when you eat too much birthday cake.  We all like something sweet but too much of a good thing ruins the experience.  There's the trouble with this book.
0385737424|5.0|I gave this to my daughter to read (who loved it) and read it myself. It is a story about a girl who receives these little slips of paper with cryptic messages. She needs to figure them out as they indicate someone is in danger.<br /><br />Part of me dislikes the issue where the notes tell her not to \\"tell a grown up\\" (and the protagonist obeys.) This could be a potentially bad message to send to young readers. But, it also brings to light good area of discussion about such things with your kids! The rest of the story is great. The mystery kept me interested throughout and the characters seemed very believable. I don't want to give too much away about the plot, but felt that there were different things of value to learn from reading the book, mostly about how your judgments about other people and of things may not be correct.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Most homossexuals in the world doesn't know or don't want to see they're homossexual. They avoid opportunities by fear to discover them selves loving or desiring another person for the same sex type. This movie shows, in a romantic way, a discovery of a young guy fullfiled with a father spirit to your nephew. The movie thus set critics to a straight relationship focus on the mother unresponsability about her son. Thus show that doesn't matter if you are gay or not, what trully matter is your heart intention, the way you see your life and how we care about others, including family and children. A great movie, in particular to those who doesn't get out of closet yet. The location in California is very beautiful including the sunset (I was in California when I saw this movie).

B000AOEMXM|2.0|It's almost an oxymoron, isn't it? But it describes this series to a T. Ever since the \\"Original Series\\", the Star Trek franchise has been defined more by its fanbase than its content or cast. That segment of the population which outsiders prefer to call \\"nerds\\". A few months before this series came out, SNL cast member Norm MacDonald announced the impending release of a new Star Trek series on that show's \\"Weekend Update\\" sketch as being for \\"nerds\\". Probably the best definition of that term, once you cull out all the facets that totally differ from person to person, get rid of all the stuff that amounts to non-ethnic bigotry, face the fact that a nerd isn't necessarily the kid who gets better marks in school or reads too much--the solidest definition of \\"nerds\\" is people who are overenthusiastic about things that the mainstream could care less about. The Star Trek fanbase has overdone it, to be sure. Showing up at conventions in full Starfleet uniform when only a small percentage of sports fans own their team's official jersey. And sports fans are a more powerful demographic than \\"Trekkies\\" any day of the week. What this series amounts to is a Star Trek For Non-Wierdos, which is a contradiction in terms when you remember that sci-fi is by definition about weird stuff. What you have to do is come up with a vehicle that can impress the middle school market, a population segment that has a built-in sneer on its collective face. So we have a captain who's an aging dreamboat, a foxy Vulcan who has the requisite regal beauty, a Tac Officer who looks like he could be a descendant of 007 and a Texan good ole boy chief engineer. The doc is an alien who defines \\"avuncular\\"--you can easily imagine him in tweed and glen plaid. Maybe it was George Dubya Bush who killed off this segment of the Trek franchise--it went under about when the former President began to be the most venomously hated. Engineer Trip Tucker, initially the most likable character here, resembles him way too much. Or maybe it's that old truism about consumerism that goes something like \\"You can take a dog dropping and roll it in confectioner's sugar and it still won't be a pastry item--all it'll be is a sugar-coated dog dropping\\".much. Or maybe it's that old truism about consumerism that goes something like \\"You can take a dog dropping and roll it in confectioner's sugar and it still won't be a pastry item--all it'll be is a sugar-coated dog dropping\\".

B000002UB3|5.0|In 1978, when I was 8. I listened to my Mom's Abbey Road record and I instantly fell in love with the Beatles music. I probably wore out the record from listening to it so much. Every song on Abbey Road is special. I was too young at the time to understand the lyrics well. When I listen to it today, it is still enjoyable and it gives me goosebumps.  The Beatles had such a special chemistry even if they did not always get along. Their music will withstand the test of time.  This is definitely one of my desert island discs. Anybody can appreciate Abbey Road.
B001I82RVS|3.0|Tokyo Gore Police, as if you couldn't tell by reading the film's title alone, is an ultra violent gore-fest that drips with social satire.  In the vein of The Machine Girl and Dead Alive, there is a heaping amount of over the top gore and arterial spray to make even the most jaded gorehound happy.  Audition's Eihi Shiina stars as Ruka, a member of Tokyo's deadly privatized police force, which are at odds with \\"engineers\\", which are basically genetically modified supercriminals that are nasty looking enough to make David Cronenberg wince.  Ruka takes plenty of them down during the course of Tokyo Gore Police, leading up to some stunning revelations about her the fate of her father, along with plenty of Robocop-style social satire along the way.  While Tokyo Gore Police doesn't disappoint in terms of its gore content and such, it just feels drawn out (at nearly 110 minutes), and not nearly as entertaining as The Machine Girl.  Still, flaws aside, there's enough to admire with Tokyo Gore Police to recommend it if any of this sounds like your kind of thing, and that respect alone, there's plenty here that you have to see to believe regardless.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody Gardot \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" is one of the best CD's we have heard in years. Her music, her voice and her band are solid. She sings in the traditions of Nancy Wilson, Nina Simone and others. A pure relaxing  enjoyment!

1595141715|5.0|I was so excited when my on-line book club selected THIRTEEN REASONS WHY by Jay Asher<br />as its first ever pick. I have heard so many wonderful things about this book, and I was looking for a reason to read it. Let me warn you though: this book is incredible and once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down. I was so caught up in this story that I actually went to my bedroom and shut the door so I read the last 50 pages without any interruptions. (I know...bad mom!)<br /><br />After I finished this book, I was deeply touched and desperately wanted to talk about it with someone (thank goodness for Twitter.) It really would make the perfect book club discussion book (for adults and/or teenagers.) There are just so many issues in THIRTEEN REASONS WHY that would not only be interesting to talk about, but actually need to be talked about. Unfortunately, I'm going to miss our meeting this month -- our first one. My daughter's friend (and fellow mother-daughter book club member) is performing in our high school production of Les Miserables as young Cosette. I can't wait to hear what everyone else thought about it!<br /><br />THIRTEEN REASONS WHY deals with a very serious (and intense) topic -- teen suicide. The story is incredible -- Clay finds a mysterious package which is filled with seven tapes. The tapes were made by Hannah in the days prior to her suicide, and she spells out the \\"13 reasons why\\" she felt she had to take her own life. Needless to say, after listening to the tapes, Clay's life will never be the same and he'll never see things the way he did before.<br /><br />I absolutely adored Clay, and I thought he was a wonderful character. He was such a nice, sensitive guy; and while he had his own share of teenage insecurities, he was able to keep things in perspective. My heart definitely went out to him as he listened to the tapes and wondered why he was one of the reasons for Hannah's suicide. I found it so difficult to imagine the kind of pain he felt, and I was desperately hoping that he wouldn't blame himself for not doing more to help Hannah.<br /><br />Not only did I think the plot of this book was extremely smart, but I also really appreciated how the author decided to tell the story. The book went back and forth between Hannah's voice on the tape and Clay's first person narrative in the present. I can't express how well Mr. Asher created both of these characters and their voices -- they were so incredibly real to me. I was so impressed with how he could effectively use both characters' voices to tell the story. As a reader, I loved getting both Hannah's and Clay's insight into the story.<br /><br />I'm not going to sugarcoat this -- THIRTEEN REASONS WHY was at times very difficult for me to read. I didn't love high school when I was there and I could really sympathize with Hannah and her insecurities. While most kids deal with these issues all the time during their teenage years, Hannah couldn't; and I found it so sad that no one (including her parents) really knew or understood the pain she was in. It's a little scary to think about dealing with my two children during these tough teenage times (at least I have a few years to get prepared), but I hope we are instilling in them the confidence they need to deal with the normal (but painful) situations.<br /><br />I highly recommend THIRTEEN REASONS WHY especially if you have teenagers in your life. It is a powerful book that discusses many important issues. I would love to see how it affects kids who are actually in high school dealing with the same problems that Hannah faced. I sincerely hope this book might just make kids think before saying or doing something that others might find embarrassing or painful. Or maybe even help kids extend themselves to someone who appears to be lonely. If this book could have that effect on even a few people, what an amazing difference it could make in someone's life.ng that he wouldn't blame himself for not doing more to help Hannah.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I'm extremely pleased with this Blu Ray collection. All 3 movies in 1080p High Definition and HD sound too! Also includes a TON of special features and the Animatrix short films collection. (Most of the special features are shot in SD though)All said though, this is a must own for any serious movie collector/buff, even if the 3rd film was less then stellar!
B00110K62U|2.0|I've seen Les Mis twice live.  Once in London and once in NYC.  It was the first play I ever went to and love every second of it.<br /><br />This DVD captures none of that.  What it does capture is the music.  However, since they are no longer have Les Mis on Broadway, I wanted to show my girlfriend the show and how wonderful it is.  It is impossible using this DVD.  It's all singing.  While beautiful, it does nothing for storytelling.  Unless you've seen the play, you will have NO idea what's going on here.<br /><br />That being the case, if you're just looking for the music, why not buy the Audio CD?  Having the songs only as a DVD is pretty pointless.  Big disappointment when I finally watched this.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|\\"The Holiday\\" is really just a sentimental, kinda get in touch with your inner romantic kinda film. It stars Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, and Jack Black as our \\"unlucky in love\\" stars who pair up to find happiness. There are a couple memorable lines and scenes in the movie and the attractions don't seem stale or forced. I really liked Kate Winslet character and was happily surprised with Jack Black as a romantic interest. Overall, a good movie to snuggle up to the fire with.

B0026NWBY2|1.0|I totally agree with the reviewer that complained about the selections and the fact that Beatles' songs are on this cd. Even at 9.98 it's a rip off. Take the reviewer's advice and make your own compilation until someone with taste comes up with one containing real rarities! This cd is a pity...

B00005JLR2|2.0|Even more of a lowpoint for Disney animation than their troubled 70s-early 80s films, it's hard to think of a worse animated feature from the studio than Treasure Planet. It's one of those pitches that sounds like a really bad idea when you hear it - a sci-fi version of Treasure Island with galleons as spaceships and a cyborg Long John Silver - but which, when you see it, turns out to be even worse than it looked.<br /><br />It's from that period at the beginning of the century when Disney started to be running scared of the competition, changing their plans based purely on what their rivals were doing. Having turned Kingdom of the Sun, a half-completed epic drama into all-out comedy The Emperor's New Groove to compete with DreamWorks' Road to El Dorado, they then developed two animated adventures to counter the renewed threat of Don Bluth and his surprisingly good but hugely unsuccessful Titan AE. While Atlantis worked well enough until it reached its destination and fell foul of clumsy anime/New Age clichés, Treasure Planet never even gets off the starting blocks. It's colourful and very expensive looking without ever being particularly visually appealing, while despite a story by Pirates of the Caribbean writers, there's little wit here (a few verbal gymnastics from Emma Thompson's feline captain aside). Suspension of disbelief is a major problem - just how does everyone breathe in space? - but even bigger is the way the film confuses haste for excitement, in a constant rush that never allows it to create interesting characters or credible worlds as it races from one CGi heavy sequence to another, constantly throwing in uninvolving set pieces that are supposed to make you go WOW! but are more likely to evoke yawns as it trudges mechanically through a thousand animation clichés. Small wonder its failure sounded the death knell for traditional 2-dimensional animation at Disney for much of the rest of the decade.
0316017922|3.0|If you're a parent, you might not want to read this book! Malcolm Gladwell's attempt to explain how people succeed is depressing for anyone whose child was born in the last half of the year, anyone who lets their child loaf during the summer and anyone who isn't single-minded enough to make their child put 10,000 hours into an endeavor.<br /><br />Gladwell's predictors of success make it seem as if there is almost no way to rise above certain accidents of birth, geography and social class. And who knows, maybe there isn't. If so, I don't really want to hear it!<br /><br />Of course, there is something to all this. Children of the wealthy and well-connected have advantages. Thus it will always be. But I don't think you can entirely discount (as Gladwell tries to) American rags-to-riches stories that suggest individual effort and ability have a lot to do with success.<br /><br />As in all of Gladwell's books, the stories are what propel the book... Canadian hockey players, Bill Gates, etc. But in this book, I wasn't always sure what the illustrations had to do with the premise. For example, the whole chapter on \\"the ethnic theory of plane crashes\\" was fascinating. But what did it have to do with the success of individuals? He is veering off course by talking about entire cultures and systems. Besides, even if he were talking about individual pilots (and not airlines, countries and cultures), is he suggesting that only successful pilots keep their planes from crashing? For every Capt. Sullenberger, there are other highly skilled pilots whose planes crash and passengers die through no fault of the pilot's.<br /><br />I also found the chapter on the connection between rice paddies and math ability another meaningless detour. Is he really suggesting that individuals from Asian cultures excel at math because the children come from hard-working rice farming communities? I think U.S. farmers might disagree with his statement that rice farmers work harder than anyone in the U.S. works. In fact, I think I'll end my review here because I have to get back to work!'ll end my review here because I have to get back to work!

B00275EGWO|4.0|The first 20 minutes were taut, well acted and, overall, fantastic. Unfortunately, I had to enjoy much of the remainder of the movie with my eyes closed, due to the camerawork. The movie was filmed, documentary-style, with hand-held cameras. You'd be hard-pressed to find a steady outdoor scene in the entire film, that didn't play tug-of-war with your equilibrium. Not the best friend of anyone susceptible to motion sickness, like me.     I was so incredibly queasy that I couldn't even get up to leave the theater (like I did during the Blair Witch Project), though I noticed at least 5 or 6 others did. I stayed throughout the entire film, *listening* to a movie I paid $12 to *see*, occasionally sneaking a peak, to see what was going on.    I understand the quality of filming this way - it makes the audience feel like they're *there* and it's becoming a common trait in many new movies. But for an action movie,  it's asking a little too much of your motion sensory in my opinion.    As for the story, itself:    The movie wasn't quite what I was expecting, and that's a good thing. I thought it was just going to be another war movie, but it was so much more. Had a little bit of Jarhead, Platoon and Blown Away tastefully &  intelligently woven into its fabric. Had quite a few laughs, as well.    +1 for the Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and David Morse *cameos*. Honestly, these guys can bring respectability to any film, though it was nice that their screen time was limited. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty drove this film and deserve every ounce of the accolades it will receive.    +1 For the movie not trying to spur any political debates. I felt that this movie steered clear of the good guy and bad guy designations.    +1 For military EOD units finally getting some recognition.

Humorous and serious and ultimately engaging! I wanted to read it again, after I finished the book.

0061767581|4.0|The book \\"LA Candy\\" is a fun read for HILLS fans.  The content of the book is clearly fictional in nature, but allows the HILLS viewer a \\"reality check\\" regarding the filming of the show. The only discouraging part of reading \\"LA Candy\\" is the cliff hanger at the end.  The build up to the story line is great, but then just as the story gets going we are left waiting for the next book.  A great marketing plow I'm sure, but maybe not so great when your consumers have no idea when the next book will be available.
0920668364|5.0|My boys and I have had this book for more than 18 years.  It has always been our favorite.  When they were toddlers the boys especially loved the rhythmic song that the mother would sing to her child as he went from infant to toddler to little boy to teenager to a grown man.  And the illustrations are fabulous -- The boys got a kick out of the realistic mischief the boy in the book would get into.  Each of us can still recite the song perfectly.  I must have read that story 100 times!  And although I still have the book, it is pretty tattered.  Every since that time I planned to share this story with them when they became adults.  Now that they are \\"grown\\" (19 & 22 years old) they still remember how I used to read to them all of the time, but the one book they actually remember the title of is Love You Forever.  This story of the \\"cycle of life\\", and the love between a mother and her child is absolutely beautiful.  I recently ordered 2 hard-cover copies to give to them as gifts -- I know they will be thrilled.

But I only can give her five.<br /><br />Her whispery alto caresses but it doesn't necessary relax you. It will win you over, and I'm not going to get into a discussion about whether this is jazz (smooth or crunchy), blues, pop. It's what it is. Favorite cuts? Must I? Oh well, the torchy \\"Baby I'm a Fool,\\" the Bossa Nova-ish, \\"If the Stars Were Mine\\" (I prefer the acoustic version, cut 2), The bluesy \\"Your Heart Is as Black as Night,\\" the torchy \\"Our Love Is Easy,\\" and the autobiographical(?) \\"Who Will Comfort Me?\\" with the delirious scatty ending.<br /><br />Then there's the one cover version, \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" which Melody totally reworks in Brazilian style (I half expected one stanza sung in Portuguese, but no). She owns the tune now.<br /><br />And you should own this CD.
0515141429|2.0|OK...  Lee Child was recommended to me by someone with whom I usually agree with on mystery novels.  Great authors like Robert Parker, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, etc... So I was happy to have Child and Jack Reacher suggested to me, especially with several books already written to carry me through the next releases by other top authors.<br /><br />The Killing Floor started out pretty good and had me hooked.  But then Child lost it and while I'm about 5/8ths finished with the book, it's getting harder and harder to pick up.  I like the story overall and will finish the book... but...<br /><br />Child overwrites way too much.  He does not know when to leave the scene, letting things go on way too long.  He repeats himself quite a bit.  Since the story is first person, I don't mind the \\"thought process\\" style of writing, but Reacher's (Retcher?) thought process belies his tough guy image.  Parker shows how a tough guy can still be sensitive and maintain deep emotional connections to characters, but Reacher is really \\"reaching\\" when it comes to getting out of the shallow end of his.<br /><br />This story, as I said, is interesting.  And I forgive the relative inaccuracies of the Atlanta area (my town), but boy... the coincidences stack up and up and the general unbelievability of the scenarios and consequences of such is just too much.  There are also a lot of convenient incidences and reactions (or lack of action) that cause the story to not unfold naturally, but follow the course Child wants it to.<br /><br />Of note:  a Keystone Kops type scene at the Atlanta Airport that results in the convenient death of a character.  Any thought at all and this could have been made exciting and more realistic.<br /><br />Also Reacher feels he made a mistake in analysis of another character's situation (cool to be not 100% right, like that!), but then due to even worse analysis he keeps declaring a character dead -- and I'm still not sure he is, but there is no reason for Reacher to have that solid a conclusion at all.<br /><br />Reacher is also frustrated when people die before they can tell him \\"who they are working for\\", etc... but then when he gets the drop on a couple of guys tailing him, he responds (under total concealment), by blowing them away rather than trying to interrogate them.  Under barely any immediate threat, he choose to just backshoot them.  No honor, no fair fight, no attempt to wound and subdue.  Just blow them away.  But hey, anything to make the plot drag out, right?<br /><br />Finally, when Reacher discovers he's in possession of some counterfeit money... he decides to continue to use it to buy materials and pay expenses.  Former miliary cop???  Good guy???  Spreading phony money and setting up innocent shopkeepers for potential trouble?  I don't think so at all.<br /><br />Oh well... long review and like I said, I'll muddle through to the end.  But like Vince Flynn and other \\"hot\\" authors who really cannot write well, Lee Child is going to go on the very back burner for some time.l.

Amazon pushed it on me for weeks, and the minute I stepped into Borders an employee ran over and recommended it.  Thinking, this really better be the best book I've ever read, I took it up to the checkstand, where the register guy asked: \\"Did one of our employees recommend this?\\"  Um, yeah.  And Amazon, too.  So of course I asked him why.<br /><br />\\"Oh,\\" he replied, \\"we've been told to recommend it this week.\\"  That should have tipped me off right there: recommendations handed down by management.  Pfft.  I hesitate to suggest a conspiracy, but - did someone end up with too many of these in a warehouse in Duluth?  Did Oprah make a bet with someone that she could pull strings and make the most boring book in the world a best seller?<br /><br />But I am suckered in by numerous good reviews and a fairly interesting book jacket description, so I buy it and take it with me on a trip camping with my family.  Of course it totally sucks.  I'm kicking myself because I feel like I really should have known.  But the reviews - ALL the reviews - are absolutely positive from generally reliable sources, so I just DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND.<br /><br />Here's why I don't like it: I am about a third of the way into it, and literally hundreds of characters have been introduced.  NOT ONE of them has done anything interesting, so I am finding it nearly impossible to keep them straight.  I am the type that will be more or less satisfied reading the back of a cereal box, but this is BAD.  I mean bad.  The mystery is dull. The who done it is more like a who cares.  The two primary characters are so far not very likable at all - in fact, the review descriptions are more interesting than the book descriptions of them.  I'm betting part of the problem is the translation, presumably - but god, there is just some boring writing in here, too.  \\"He went to the store.  He bought milk.  He was cold.  He went home.\\" - BOR-RING!  I am not really exaggerating, either.<br /><br />Actual content:<br />\\"He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches.  He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food.  he offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst.  After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.\\"<br /><br />Again, I'm willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt with the translating, but I wouldn't have gotten out of high school writing with that kind of boring and utterly pointless description.  It sets the tone of \\"lonely dude being lonely\\" but really: two sandwiches?  why two?  sausage and liverwurst - fascinating.<br /><br />That's really just a page I opened to randomly - there is much worse.  I am truly bitterly resentful of every minute I am stuck on the side of this mountain without a good book to read.  I'm ready to browse the mini mart down the way and read the real estate magazines instead.  Why have all the reviewers and Amazon steered me SO WRONG???<br /><br />I am not starting any kind of flame war here or trying to insult anyone's taste - so please don't get mad about my opinion.  But if you love this book, please - tell me WHY.  What am I missing?He went home.\\" - BOR-RING!  I am not really exaggerating, either.

I was expecting a Vince Flynn type of action novel, and for me, this did not deliver...nails intact.

0061020710|3.0|Ankh-Morpork is the greatest city on the Discworld - a flat planet carried through space on the back of four elephants standing astride a giant turtle - and has seen fire, flood, famine and even the odd barbarian invasion during its long history, but even it is unprepared for the arrival of a much more devastating threat: tourism. Twoflower is the first visitor to the city from the distant Agatean Empire, and is happy wandering around taking 'pictures' of the 'sights' with his magic box and soaking up the 'authentic' atmosphere. This behaviour in Ankh-Morpork would normally result in him having the lifespan of a mayfly confronted by a supernova, but luckily the wizard Rincewind has kindly 'volunteered' to be his guide and protector in return for not having his extremities removed by the city's Patrician, who is anxious to avoid insulting a foreign power with an army in the millions.    Unfortunately, Twoflower's attempts to introduce the concept of fire insurance to the hardy and creative business-owners of Ankh-Morpork results in an enforced flight from the burning metropolis and the beginning of a long and very strange journey across the Disc, taking in dragons, spaceships and the fabled temple of Bel-Shamharoth along the way. All the while the only spell that has ever managed to lodge itself in Rincewind's mind is very keen to get itself said, which could be a very bad idea indeed...    Published in 1983, The Colour of Magic was the fourth novel by Terry Pratchett. His debut book, The Carpet People (1971), had been a modest success, but The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981) had both been remaindered and it looked possible that this might be Pratchett's last published novel unless it took off in a big way. It didn't look too original either, being a fantasy rewrite of Strata (which saw a spaceship from Earth discover a mysteriously flat planet and investigate it). Of course, it was a big success, buoyed by good reviews, and became an eventual bestseller. Pratchett wrote a direct sequel, The Light Fantastic, and then more books set in the same world with different casts of characters. As of this time of writing the Discworld series consists of thirty-six novels with the thirty-seventh due in a couple of months and Pratchett is the world's biggest-selling living fantasy author after J.K. Rowling and Stephen King. Not bad for such humble beginnings.    The Colour of Magic, as the first book in the series, of course shows the Discworld in a far more embryonic state than later books. The subtler, satirical streak that develops over the first half-dozen books or so is also missing. Instead, the novel is a much broader and somewhat more obvious pastiche of swords 'n' sorcery. The targets that Pratchett goes after are interesting as Rincewind and Twoflower encounter cultures and monsters that Lovecraft, Howard and Leiber would have found quite familiar.    For all its distance from the later Discworld books, The Colour of Magic is still an entertaining and funny book. Pratchett's previous two novels had funny elements, but had broadly been trying to be more serious, 'proper' SF books. The Colour of Magic is clearly written with more confidence and in a more relaxed style. Even today it still raises a smile, possibly as some of Pratchett's targets have come back into vogue (the Cthulu-esque section resonates a bit more these days, especially), and taken on its own merits the book is solidly entertaining. Pratchett's characterisation still needs some work and his interpretations here of Death and the Patrician are notably different from the later books, but it was from this seed that the author began his ascent to becoming one of the dominating forces of modern fantasy, and it still holds up.    The Colour of Magic (***) is a bit old-school, but still amusing and entertaining, much faster-paced than his later work but at the same time lacking some of the subtlety and intelligence of other books in the series. It is available now in the UK and USA. Sky One broadcast a television adaption of the book and its sequel, The Light Fantastic, last year, which is now available on DVD in the UK and USA and on Blu-Ray in the UK.

I'm not even half way in, but I know it'll be worth the time and sore arms (cause it weighs a few pounds). It's a work of genius that should not be skipped- how many of those exist from the past 20 years?

You can hear the heart break in \\"White Horse\\" and \\"You're Not Sorry\\" and my favorites on the album are \\"You Belong With Me\\", \\"The Way I Loved You\\" and \\"Breathe\\".

0061689246|2.0|This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in reading a book after seeing a movie. Usually, the book is always better.... Lord of the Rings, The Golden Compass, and The Princess Bride just to name a few. Stardust, on the other hand, was a pretty bad novel. I found the characters in the movie much more interesting where as in the book they were fairly one dimensional.<br /><br />Overall, rent the movie and skip the book.

B00164KYV4|4.0|I saw the movie after watching the Sex and the City episode of the same title 9for the 21546th time), from where the idea for the book came from and later the idea for the movie.     \\"He Is Just Not That Into You\\" is a more realistic romantic comedy - not every character gets a happy Hollywood ending, but they all grow in the span of their relationships. The movie is a lot more hopeful than the book it was loosely adapted from.     The cast is superb, particularly Ginnifer Goodwin as a girl who just can't seem to find love, but is desperately looking for it with every guy she meets.     The opening sequence of the movie is worth the price of the film alone - it speaks to the core of what causes the misunderstandings and misgivings that girls have about relationships.

It's stunning to see an adult demagogue in action one whose work in philosopher Plantinga's estimation is so obvioiusly \\"less than sophomoric\\". It is truly frightening that there are actually people out there who will read this philosophical illiterate pronounce on philosophical matters and nod their heads knowingly, duped by their own ignorance of even the basics.     Materialist fundamentalists like Dawkins are the intellectual counterparts of the religious fundamentalists he derides. This is a stunningly stupid book insulting to and ignorant of the entirety of both western history and its rigorous intellectual treasures that have bequeathed us our intellectual and scientific triumps.

B001UV4XU6|5.0|Let me warn you: Save this film until the end of summer, as there is unlikely to be a better film in the next two months. (500)Days of Summer manages to successfully juggle between a non-chronological retelling, a quick wit and a peculiar sense of humor, and a story that doesn't lead to a happy Hollywood ending that everyone anticipates. That alone is accomplishment enough, but this film takes it one step further - it actually relies on the common predisposition to expect two lead characters to end up together at the end of the film and turns that notion upside down, while proving a rewarding and enjoyable watching experience.     The fact of the matter is that we have been pre-programmed for the boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love-with-girl-lives-happily-ever-after tale far too long to actually believe the narrator of the story, who faithfully cautions us in the beginning credits that the film is not a love story, but rather a story about love. The movie is much, much more. It's a story about growing up, growing apart, and realizing your strengths and weaknesses and what it means to be in a relationship, what it means to be over a relationship, and what it means to be out of a relationship.      Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fabulously sympathetic in his role as Tom, the boy who believes in love and is willing to wager on it and then suffers the consequences, whereas Zooey Deschanel makes Summer likable even though, at times, she shouldn't be.    The movie benefits from a fantastic script and a realistic view of life. It also doesn't hurt to have two talented actors in their leading roles couples with a strong supporting cast and a hip, upbeat soundtrack.
0307266303|5.0|\\"If you have run with footmen and they have tired you out,<br />Then how can you compete with horses?\\" -- Jeremiah 12:5<br /><br />Born to Run is an exceptional book -- intriguing, surprising, and continually compelling. The writing exceeds what most of the best fiction thriller and suspense writers ever achieve. Run, don't walk, to get your copy!<br /><br />From little things, large things sometimes emerge. Author Christopher McDougall couldn't find out why his feet hurt after running. His search for the answer took him way beyond the doctor's office and the usual cortisone shots into a world of people who run for days at a time in dangerous conditions without injury. I won't spoil the story by telling you what he learned, but he's a master storyteller who will keep you spellbound by his stories about running, runners, and those who train and \\"help\\" them.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect when I started this book, but I was satisfied more then ten times over with what I received. I had been an avid runner as a teenager but hadn't done much in a long time due to shin splints. Recently, I discovered that soft ground and spongy tracks allowed me to run again without shin-splint pain. I was quite surprised to see that after over 40 years without running I was running as well or better than I ever had. What was that all about? This book contained the answer . . . one that may surprise you.<br /><br />If you love great stories about the indomitable spirit that lives in some people, enjoy dreaming about doing the seemingly impossible, or just want to be thrilled by mind-blowing accomplishment, this book is for you. If speculating about anthropology and evolution fascinate you, you have a treat here as well.<br /><br />And don't be surprised if you develop an urge to run . . . without stopping.
B001SN78JO|3.0|One can't help but reminisce about the 1990s, a time when Jim Carrey was hilariously funny and Judd Apatow's raunchy, but heartfelt raunchy comedies didn't exist. Those days are gone. Instead, movies like Yes Man are made - Jim Carrey is forced to suppress his humor because it is even less politically correct these days than it was in the '90s, everyone pretends that they are filming a Judd Apatow comedy even when they are not, and there must be absolutely be some sort of revelation made at the end of the movie about current trends (i.e., Jim Carrey's character wants to \\"be with the girl\\" but not move in with/marry her).
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|What an incredibly delightful, beautiful, wonderful and, dare I say, uplifting movie this is! A true piece of art from the animators at Pixar, bringing together a great story line, some wondrous visuals and some very memorable characters.    Up is the latest in a string of great Pixar films going back to the likes of Toy Story, which I still haven't seen. It's the best of their movies I've seen so far, and certainly the most beautiful to look at (beating out the previous best looking film, Finding Nemo). It's sweet without being saccharine, touching and enjoyable.    The film tells the story of an old man who, in his youth, met the girl of his dreams. They married and held out an ambition to visit far off exotic locales in South America. Little things (like real life), keep them from doing this until finally, for the wife, it's too late. Her husband (wonderfully voice by Ed Asner), despondent, lonely and no longer really belonging anywhere, ties off a bunch of balloons and takes his house into the air in a manner that looks almost plausible.    Joining him is a young \\"Wilderness\\" Scout (continuing the trend in popular entertainment whereby the Boy Scouts don't exist, but all other forms of scouts do), who is trying to earn what is most emphatically not called a Merit Badge for helping the elderly. They wind up meeting a very colorful moa-type bird and a dog who talks by virtue of a collar (and is obsessed with squirrels).    The film is flawless. Seriously, I couldn't find a single thing to dislike (something I had no problem with during last year's Wall-E). The visuals are stunning, the plot is great and the acting is wonderful. It's without a doubt the best film I've seen all year (though considering the string of movies I've seen recently, this isn't saying a lot). It's suitable for children of all ages and their parents will likely have a blast as well.    In fact the only problem I had with the film wasn't with the film itself, but with the Partly Cloudy shortthat came before it. It was cute and slightly funny, but way too twee.    I can't tell you what the 3-D version of the film is like, as my local theatre doesn't do 3-D. But the 2-D version is great, and I highly recommend it!

There is also something else about it that reminds me of Twilight, but I won't ruin the surprise.  I wish this book never had to end!
B001CC7PP8|5.0|Anthony Perkins became a household name after starring in Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\". Playing the mentally unbalanced momma's boy Norman Bates, Perkin's portrayal is both mesmerizing and haunting as he leaves the viewer enthralled with his vivid performance of one of the cinema's most complicated characters. Janet Leigh is also fantastic in this, although her character is killed off early in the film. Out of all of Hithcock's films \\"Psycho\\" is the best, with his other masterpiece \\"The Birds\\" coming in a close second.<br /> If you enjoy \\"Psycho\\" you will love the \\"Psycho\\" sequels and prequel that are available in one fabulous set: in it you get all three remaining \\"Psycho\\" films, \\"Psycho 2\\", \\"Psycho 3\\", and the prequel that was made for cable TV called appropriately \\"Psycho 4\\". There is also a remake of \\"Psycho\\" that is available individually starring Anne Heche and Julianne Moore, directed by Gus Vant Sant, that was released in the late '90's. Not up to par with the original, it is nevertheless entertaining.<br /> This particular set of \\"Psycho\\" is filled to the brim with bonuses, the best being an informative 90 minute documentary on the making of this Hollywood classic. One thing is certain after watching \\"Psycho\\": you will be nervous when taking a shower. Janet Leigh stated many years before her death that after filming wrapped she could never take a shower for the rest of her life.

B00241YHMU|2.0|I had heard so much hype about The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I had to see it even though I rarely watch Brad Pitt movies, not being a particular fan of his work. Usually, when I have low expectations of a movie, which I had about this one (it sounded preposterous to me, but I simply wanted to quell my curiosity), I end up liking it far more than if I had high or higher expectations. However, this movie broke that mold for me.<br /><br />There are a hundred thousand stories yet to be told to entertain us into oblivion. This is one that should have been left untold or given to a different group of people to bring it to life. I would have given it one star, but I gave it two because there were some extraordinary performances outside of the main character that do not deserve to be ignored.<br /><br />I think the director of this movie made some odd choices in putting the final version together. Button is born old and ages backward. If you can buy that \\"genetic anomaly,\\" I suppose you wouldn't look too closely at how much opportunity was wasted after his birth. There is no explanation for his sudden piano-playing ability, no education to speak of, no indication that Button was aware of his odd situation until, suddenly, Brad Pitt appears in the role and just as suddenly, he is gorgeous, well-muscled, and a heart throb. I guess the whole thing transcended my ability to process the \\"outside-the-box\\" growth issue inherent in this story. I just thought it was clumsy and unendearing.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that a much better story lay somewhere in that picture. A different director, producer, actor, perhaps. Tweaking the story to make more sense with better communication between Button and those around him as the story unfolds perhaps. As it was, it appeared to me, to be a messy story and another two hours of my life wasted when I could have been watching something far more worthwhile. I am not unaware of the popularity of this movie amongst much more esteemed reviewers here at Amazon.com than I am. But watching it from a director's eye, I could almost write a book about how many things were wrong with this movie. If a movie has character, I can always forgive those wrong things.

1401309666|5.0|Wow.    Where to begin with this one.    Even though this book was released a few years ago, the concepts and contents of this book will probably be relevant for eternity, as long as there are means for abundant choice. I highly recommend everyone  read this, particularly if you are in either business or technology, as it is relevant to both fields. (specifically: marketing / internet technology)    Essentially, \\"The Long Tail\\" refers to a powerlaw curve, where the vast majority of VOLUME is comprised of very few products, and the vast maority of PRODUCTS individually pull a very small number of sales. (The example used by the author is comparing books / CD's offered by Wal-Mart, which sells only hits, versus the books / CDs sold by Amazon.com, which sells pretty much everything you can imagine). It's a contrasting between \\"hits\\" and \\"niches\\". In a situation where choice is abundant (such as on amazon) a Long-tail distribution will often emerge.    But the true strength of this book is the insight in both the case-studies and applications.    Anderson looks repeatedly to amazon.com, Rhapsody (the music service), social networking sites like Youtube.com or mySpace/Facebook, the iTunes store, and non-long-tail situations like the traditional music and film industry (the people currently trying to sue their way back into relevance), newspapers, and other media that have traditionally flourished in scarce \\"shelf space\\" scenarios.    In today's society, Long Tails frequently emerge as the \\"tools of production are democratized,\\" or as \\"filters\\" become easier to access. People are discovering more and more options available, and are, with the assistance of filters and recommendation services (ie. Netflix, Rhapsody, iTunes, etc.) exploring alternatives and new products like never before.    One of my favorite quotes used in this book is regarding television, originally said by David Foster Wallace: \\"TV is not vulgar and prurient and dumb because the people who compose the audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests.\\" As someone that appreciates both South Park and the Marx Brothers, I can definitely relate. Anderson ties this into his opus through comparing those \\"vulgar and prurient and dumb\\" interests to the \\"hits\\" culture -- which traditionally had to make the most efficient use of scarce shelf space to maximize sales for the store, the producer, and ultimately the content creator. But in a Long Tail culture, we can explore those refined and aesthetic interests individually, because on the Internet, shelf space is an infinite commodity.    As people are more easily able to produce music, movies, works of art and publish their writing without requiring a high barrier of entry (either economically or temporally), and as the means to seek out these productions becomes easier, it will become more apparent that the demand for this kind of niche content was always there, it was just suppressed by prior technological limitations. Hits will always be hits, but with better filters, those hits will merely serve as lowest-common-denominator entry points to drive people down the tail to other genres and micro-genres they never knew they liked (or existed!).    This book is a must-read. It's not terribly long, but if you have any desire at all to \\"get\\" today's culture and the society created by the Internet, this isthe book to start with. (Music & Film Industry people, take note!)
B0026BD2GK|2.0|In 2004, Sony Legacy Recordings released a 2-CD mini box set of Santanta (1969).  The second disc contained the complete Woodstock performance (sans \\"Evil Ways\\")in perfect stereo sound, with all the stage banter as well as Chip Monck's announcements.    The producers of the Woodstock Experience version really messed with the recording.  Not only did they create an inferior sounding mix, they also removed much of the stage banter.  For example, Gregg Rolie famously announced \\"we have one more tune for you...it's called \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\"  This has been edited out of the Woodstock experience version.  I think that's really criminal.  There was no need to do this.  Since the set was less than 80 minutes, why couldn't the producers just leave everything the way it was?  Couldn't they just let it be?  It would have been so much better that way.    If you can, try to find the 2004 Santana remaster box set.  It has informative liner notes and preserves the Woodstock set in all its glory.

B00275EGWO|5.0|Honestly this really should be my number 1 pick, but I have a soft spot for Star Trek. I should also state that I'm not a big fan of war movies especially modern ones but, this movie satisfied. Hurt Locker is suspenseful, action packed, and at times a little humorous. The acting is top notch, Jeremy Renner does a great job and, fits the role perfectly. The special effects rival big budget movies. The cinematography really works its sort of a cross between 28 Days later and, Cloverfield. The movie was lengthy but didn't drag. It also stays away from the whole \\"should we be there\\" issue(I'm personally sick of the media trying to tell me how to think.)    My only real complaint in this movie was the ending. It seemed like the writer hit a wall and, tried to slap the ending together. This doesn't spoil the entire movie, and I'd still highly recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 15. Its worth the[...], if its playing near you go see it.
B0013FBS20|3.0|Rarely do non-franchised Horror Movies get the blockbuster treatment. The onscreen adaptation of Robert Matheson's brilliant novel, I Am Legend, got just that. This is the third time Hollywood has tried to bring the story to the silver screen and the results are pretty good. If you are looking for a faithful recreation of the book, look elsewhere. About the only thing you'll recognize is the character Robert Neville and the fact that he is the last man on Earth. Everything else has been changed or altered.<br /><br />Will Smith brings an interesting take to the character. Neville is now a military scientist hell-bent on figuring out a cure for a virus that has turned humanity into vampyric zombie creatures. Smith grinds out a gritty performance. As pretty much the only actor on-screen he is enthralling to watch. The man has certainly come a long way since his Fresh Prince days. The movie has excellent pacing and keeps you entertained despite the lack of dialogue. Memory induced flashbacks provide viewers with scraps of pre-apocalyptic back-story. I can't stress just how riveting Smith's Neville is to watch. Viewers will also grow fond of his best friend, Sam...a beautiful German Shepard.<br /><br />I am Legend's New York is eerie and unsettling. It is perhaps the most realistic post apocalyptic vision portrayed in a film. Seeing the overgrown ruins of New York City is pretty breathtaking. You really get this sense of dread and loneliness. I must give some kudos for the complete lack of music. This was such a brilliant decision. It goes a long way towards making the setting feel empty. The only music is provided by Neville playing the occasional up lifting tune from Bob Marley.<br /><br />The place where this movie falters big time is with the vampires/creatures. WHY are they all CG!?! You have this surreal, frightening setting for the story to unfold and then you see these laughably bad CG creatures and you hate the movie. Seriously, the effect of these creatures is so jarring to witness that the Genie from Aladdin might as well be trying to scare us.<br /><br />I Am Legend has the blueprint of a smart and well executed horror thriller. It's such a shame that they went with such horrible CG effects for the vampires. If you can get past that piss poor judgment on the filmmakers behalf, then you will find an enjoyable movie experience. Hollywood still hasn't provided us with a faithful version of Matheson's novel...however this one is still worth checking out.<br /><br />Final Grade: B-hat the Genie from Aladdin might as well be trying to scare us.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|This DVD starts out with an amazing opening where Michael blasts up through the floor and lands on stage...and just stands in his position as the crowd goes insane at the sight of the legendary superstar, all studded out and ready to perform.<br /><br />After watching this, I later learned this was the 69th show he had done on this tour.  I'm amazed at how much energy he has to dance through all these songs.  On a few songs like Human Nature he is trying to save his voice and this is well noted as it is the 69th show.  I am blow away he was able to perform like this after so many concerts.<br /><br />The second to last song Heal the World..is very touching as Michael tenderly  leads little children out to the stage.  You can see how his face lights up when looking at the kids and his love for children is apparent here.  He kisses a little toddler and the look in his face is radiating love.<br /><br />We have lost a great singer, entertainer, musical genius who loved people and cared about children and the world more than he loved himself.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I LOVE everything about this combo CD and DVD!  The music is intoxicating, and the ability of Mark Johnson to edit each song into the incredible creation that each one is, boggles my mind.  It's a terrific endeaver, and a great price from Amazon!
B00005RHF8|5.0|Please give us a break, all you people who review and rate movies based on some book you read. This is a movie, it is not a book, so don't expect it to be exactly the same as a story you read before. And especially, don't expect the actors and actresses to look the way you imagined them to look when you read about the characters in a book. How silly! Aside from the fact that no two people will imagine the same character looking the same after reading the same book, even more important is the fact that if the selection of an actor were done based on the physical description in a book, we would never get the pleasure of experiencing the talents of the really great actors.    So, this is a wake up call to all MOVIE reviewers: No movie review is valid if it tries to compare the movie with a book by the same name. Also, PLEASE include the UPC Code of the movie you are reviewing if you are discussing the quality of the DVD production. Amazon just mixes them all together, so nobody can tell which are good and which are poor quality productions unless you include the UPC in your review.    All ranting aside, I love this movie. I would pay any price for a top quality, complete DVD release of it. If you find one, please share the UPC code with the rest of us. Thanks.

B00005K9LN|1.0|It all started in '79 for me. We were going to see Robin Trower that night at the San Bernardino Fairgrounds and we were listening to some records and getting stoned at my friend Greg's house before we left. Someone put on the new record they just got \\"Unleashed in the East\\" and my mind was blown. After that show me and my friends went and bought all of the previous Judas Priest albums in the next few weeks. All of them were great at the time but some stuck out as better (Sad Wings, Sin After Sin & Stained Class) & got most of the time on the turn table. Soon we heard Priest was coming to town & we got tickets to see them and bought the new album \\"British Steel\\" - which I have to admit we were a bit disapointed with compared to their previous albums. The show (with probably just a few hundred in attendance) was fantastic & we wore our Priest shirts to school with pride - though hardly anyone knew who they were 'til \\"Living After Midnight\\" & \\"Breaking the Law\\" became hits. I stopped listening to new Priest after \\"Point of No Return\\" (Oops meant Point of Entry) and seldom listen to them today - except for a couple times a year I got to throw \\"Unleashed in the East\\" back into the car cd player and rock out like I was 15 again. I recommend that \\"Live\\" album as the starting place for anyone wanting to discover Judas Priest for the first time.
0765350386|3.0|I am a huge fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. When I heard that Brandon Sanderson had been selected to finish his work I decided to read some of Sanderson's work. I had high expectations. I expected Sanderson to capture at least a fraction of the depth that Jordan's works possess, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />Unlike Jordan, Tolkien, and even J.K. Rowling, Sanderson fails to create a world that exists outside the pages of the book. You do not get the sense that you are witnessing just a portion of the world and lives of the characters. Instead, the only experiences they have are those that you read about.<br /><br />In addition, Sanderson has a tendency to repeat information or present \\"subtle\\" clues that are so blatantly obvious that it is like being hit between the eyes with a sledge hammer.<br /><br />But remember, I am a huge Jordan fan... so my expectations were for something with the depth and detail of his work. In truth, I know I'm being harsh. I would give this book 3.5 if I could, because it is not a bad fantasy work. The story line is enjoyable, and the main characters are decently developed (but the secondary characters have major developmental issues).<br /><br />So I recommend this book, but don't let your expectations be too high or you wont enjoy it as much as you could.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Having never seen the show before ordering it on Amazon, we bought it on the risk tht we would enjoy it.  Frankly, the first episode almost turned us off the show, but as we had spent all of this money (and were old enough to know that not all shows should be judged by episode one) we continued to watch it.  We got sucked into it such that we pre-ordered season two.  We found it compelling with interesting, well developed characters and a plot that often took us by surprise.  All  in all a fun show to watch for those who like things that go bump in the night.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|4.5 stars for a nearly perfect device.<br /><br />I initially purchased the g13 for Logitech's customer support over Belkin/Razor's support for their n52te. However, I soon discovered that many features of the g13 are much better than what the n52 had or what the n52te will ever have.<br /><br />Quick summary<br /><br />pros:<br />- nicer ergnomic feel<br />- more buttons<br />- thumbstick feels more natural over dpad for movement<br />- lua scripting for more complex macros / button layout behavior<br />- good support (check out their forums 'g series keyboard')<br />- software is easy to use<br />- LCD screen<br />- customizable color lit keys<br /><br />cons:<br />- currently, thumbstick is not true analog<br />- thumbstick \\"head\\" could be a little bigger<br />- left hand only<br />- some buttons are hard to reach when using thumbstick for movement<br /><br />Detailed review<br /><br />I've been debating on getting the g13 for past month or so once I discovered it's presence when I was researching the n52te. At first, the button layout and the ergonomic \\"appearance\\" did not seem as comfortable as the n52 that I owned. Of course, the store did not have one on display so I could not get a true feeling for it until I actually purchased it and brought it home.<br /><br />Oh my! I am surprised at how comfortable this device is! It has far exceeded my expectations as far as comfort goes. I have read that the thumbstick is a little small and gets extremely uncomfortable with long gaming sessions, but I find that it is more comfortable than using the dpad on the n52 for extended periods of time. I do agree that the head of the thumbstick could be a little bigger, but you do get accustomed to it. For the brave, however, websites exist which show modification of the device to use a xbox / ps2 thumbstick at the expense of your 3-year warranty.<br /><br />What I don't like about the n52 (and I didn't realize it at the time) was that the \\"hump\\" that's supposed to provide support for your palm is really a hindrance to it (for those who have small to average hands). The g13 does not have that support \\"hump\\" and the palm rest is still very comfortable and my hands are average size.<br /><br />The extra buttons (over the n52) are a nicety, but not absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, my hand rarely leaves the g13 since the extra buttons map to more functions in game. I normally use the thumbstick for movement and because of this, it's difficult to use the top-left button. However, I doubt anyone would map a regularly used action to that button while they're moving.<br /><br />At first, I thought the LCD would be nothing more than a gimmick, but it is quite useful for showing in-game stats or the healthiness of your computer while in game. A couple of the default apps that the LCD uses range from less useful (RSS reader) to useful (clock, stopwatch, system performance).<br /><br />Getting used to the g13 doesn't take very long if you are already using the n52. For the most part, if the n52 was invaluable to the game you are playing, then the g13 will be invaluable to the same game (MMORPG, RTS). In the games where the n52 didn't help much (FPS mostly), the g13 helped a little. The thumbstick felt more natural to move, but I still found myself going back to the keyboard, maybe I just need more time to adjust. Also, the pending analog joystick fix should help for FPS games that support it.<br /><br />I went ahead and downloaded the software from Logitech's website rather than risk using the potentially outdated softare that came with the g13. The software is very intuitive for those that are familiar with the n52's software. The neatest feature that I discovered was associating a new profile to a game. You can either select the executable manually or allow the g13 to do it for you.<br /><br />This process for having the g13 do it was simple:<br />1. create the new profile and name it<br />2. select the second option for detecting game.<br />3.launch the game<br />4. the g13's lcd menu will ask you to push one of the lcd buttons when your game is running<br /><br />Also, the profiles you create can be stored in the g13's onboard memory.<br /><br />Before I heard of the g13, I was a devoted n52 supporter and I really believed that the n52 could not be beat. Because the n52 is no longer in production, I was sure that my next purchase was the n52te. However, upon doing my research with the n52te, I decided not to purchase it and go with the g13 for one reason: customer support. A quick visit to the respective forums for the n52te and g13 will show who cares more about your money and your gaming experience. In doing so, Logitech has set the bar for gaming boards.e g13's onboard memory.    Before I heard of the g13, I was a devoted n52 supporter and I really believed that the n52 could not be beat.

B0029XFNAI|1.0|Oh, the remake was horrible! John Hughes doesn't trust his audience to have the intelligence to \\"get\\" something, he has to beat you over the head with it. Examples are everywhere in the remake. The bad guys are clowns. When Santa says \\"we can't let the children down\\" Doris is all \\"Yes,,, the children...\\" because, you know, we wouldn't get that she was more concerned with her parade than the kids. Santa using sign language instead of speaking Dutch. The mom who \\"just don't get it\\" that Kris is sending people to other stores becomes some overbearing Rosie O'Donnell type harpy. And lets not forget Mara Wilson lisping her way through the role to hide the fact she can't act.     The deaf girl is typical John Hughes heavy handedness and is a good example of how this movie is a joke compared to the original. Instead of accepting that the audience would have the intelligence to \\"get\\" that Santa speaking dutch could show that he really IS Santa, Hughes has his Santa use bizarrely exaggerated sign language...and it drags out forever. You half expect hughes to jump into the scene and yell at the audience \\"SEE?!? He does SIIIGGGNNN LANGUAGE!!! He Really IS Santa!!!\\"     And good 'old Mara Wilson. Can't wait for her autobiography, \\"Lisping My Way Through Hollywood.\\" At least in the original, the little girl acted.     Horrible, horrible version.     Out of all the remakes I've seen, this one is the worst! This movie was so horrible Macys refused to lend their name to it as to not tarnish the original classic. Dylan McDermott is no John Payne, Mara Wilson is no Natalie Wood for sure, and Attenborough is certainly no Edmund Gwenn. The chemistry between the actors in the original was like lightning captured in a jar. And that kind of lightning doesn't strike twice. You couldn't pay me to watch this!     Mara Wilson is awful in this version! Whispering and lisping all your lines is not acting in my book. There's a reason why Natalie Wood thrived in Hollywood long after she was a child star and why Mara Wilson is another has-been child star. THE REMAKE will never ever have the charm and enjoy the longevity that the original has. I won't even call the 1994 version by the title because its not deserving of it, I just refer to it as THE REMAKE. Like Maureen O'hara said \\"100 years from now people will still be looking at Miracle On 34TH Street (1947)\\" Don't think you can say the same of the 1994 movie thats the epitome of mediocrity.     The original is from a time when people made movies with quality and integrity, where there was a pride and sincerity the actors had for their roles and for the message of the movie - not the assembly line produced drivel they put out now where mostly the actors give a half-@ss performance just to collect their paycheck.       They could play THE REMAKE 24/7, 365 days a year and it would still never reach the pinnacle of classic, the only title that lousy film has earned is a place in the $5 bin at Walmart.

B00275EGTC|5.0|Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the man in the moon. Sam is the lone astronaut on a moonbase on the far side of the moon. He's there to mine helium that is then transported back to Earth. The mining is done remotely, huge machines roam the lunar landscape vacuuming up rocks and dust, extracting the helium. It is Sam's job to retrieve the canisters of helium and ship them off to Earth for consumption. Sam's only companion on the moonbase is Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) which oversees most of the base's operations.<br /><br />Sam is on the last 2 weeks of his three year contract and eagerly awaits his return to see his wife and daughter. Sam is starting to feel the effects of his solitude, he's starting to hallucinate. On one of his runs to retrieve a helium canister and he starts hallucinating causing a collision with the mining machine. Sam awakes to find himself in the medical bay of the moonbase, unable to remember how he got there. He fakes a hull breach to get Gerty to let him outside the moonbase. He returns to the crash site and rescues an astronaut that looks exactly like him. Is Sam hallucinating again? Is he a clone? Is the rescued astronaut a clone? Can he even be sure of what is real? Or what is human?<br /><br />These are the questions Moon's director Duncan Jones presents his audience. While there are no overt references there are echoes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and maybe Alien. While Gerty isn't as malevolent as HAL in 2001 it is a distant cousin to HAL, and perhaps less duplicitous than MOTHER in Alien. Some of the sets seem a little reminiscent of 2001 maybe that's because Jones has been influenced by it. Jones has made an excellent, thought provoking alternative to the more vapid summer blockbuster movies. Moon was in limited release until last week, and I read all the great reviews on this movie so I was really anticipating seeing it, and I wasn't disappointed.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|A fantastic look into the underbelly of 1970s London, loosely based on the story of Michael X and the Baker Street bank robbery.  With all the makings of high drama, we have a group of thugs quasi-anonymously hired to break into a bank vault to steal the contents of a specific box, thought to hold pictures of a royal family member in questionable circumstances, with the freedom to steal whatever else they like along the way.  Straightforward enough.  The robbery  isn't the real focus though, and they succeed.  What is critical is what happens after, when another covert government group becomes involved with further incriminating evidence found in the vault and many of the deposit box holders don't want to reveal the contents of their boxes.  Though the plot does deviate from the story, proper, it's fiendishly well done and viewers end up agonizing over who to pull for.  Definitely worth watching and not at all a family film.
B000FJGWBM|3.0|Memento is a very good movie. The blu-ray format presents the movie in a clean format but the extras and almost no subtitles makes it hard to share with everyone you want.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I thought this film was well done.  It moved quickly, had an engaging storyline with lots of action/adventure.  It did well to appeal to its multi-generational audience and to those who just want to see a good stand alone scifi flick.  I thought it was the best of the films, to date.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|This is not the typical movie I like to watch, but a friend of mine said it reminded him of Forrest Gump so I decided to check it out. The storyline is about a man being born as an old man who ages backwards as people around him get older. I did see a few similarities with Gump, like when Benjamin goes off adventuring and major events are happening around him. There is a good cast of characters and Pitt delivers his normal better than average performance, but what kills this movie is the female lead actress. She comes across as cold, selfish, and unloving and she wasn't the best thing to look at either which might of made her tolerable. Since this movie is, at the bottom of it all, a love story, it's hard to like it if you don't like the girl.
B001TOD92C|5.0|I went into this film with no expectations and was completely blown away.  Rourke deserved every accolade he got for the delivery of his role in this film.  Truly Tomei and Wood were stellar, as well.  Not only was keen insight into the life and choices of this man, but into a profession and passion that is often culturally misunderstood.  Though his character is beautifully flawed, his take on self-harm, life choices, and triumph and defeat evoked empathy in the viewer.  This film was marvelous.
B000003Z6I|5.0|After the Birthday Party broke up in 1983, singer Nick Cave assembled the Bad Seeds, a post-punk super group of sorts featuring ex Birthday Party guitarist Mick Harvey on drums, ex Magazine bassist Barry Adamson and Einsturzende Neubaten guitarist Blixa Bargeld.  With the group complete, Cave toned down the raucous noise of his former band and perfected his take on blues, rock, post punk art and gospel.  Cave's lyrics remained pitch black but attained a more literary tone as his writing skills developed.  Taking a cue from Leonard Cohen, Cave brought his dark tales of love and lust to a wider audience.<br /><br />Mute Records will be releasing Nick Cave & The Bad Seed's first four albums \\"From Her To Eternity, The Firstborn Is Dead, Kicking Against The Pricks and Your Funeral...My Trial\\" on May 5, 2009 and I have been lucky to hear the remastered albums.  Where once these albums sounded slight on CD, the sound has been beefed up for these reissues.  On the old CDs the instrumentation was very muddy and dense, and the vocal clarity was awful, now every strum of the guitar is sharp and the rhythm section pops.  The original track listing has also been reinstated with bonus tracks being placed on a separate disc so you can hear the album as it was intended.<br /><br />On his first album with the Bad Seeds, \\"From Her To Eternity,\\" Cave opens the album with the ominous cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Avalanche.\\"  Cave's take on this song sets the tone for the remainder of the album.  \\"From Her To Eternity\\" is an album thick on atmosphere as the feeling of dread never lets up.  Cave sings like a man possessed on \\"Cabin Fever\\" and like the hellhounds are on his trail on \\"From Her To Eternity.\\" Cave further cemented his reputation as heir to Cohen and Scott Walker with tracks like, \\"Well of Misery\\" and \\"A Box For Black Paul.\\"  Twenty-five years after its initial release, \\"From Her To Eternity\\" is still uneasy listening.<br /><br />\\"The Firstborn Is Dead\\" can be seen as Nick Cave's Americana album as it reflects Cave's adopted love of the blues and also pays homage to the battered blues of Skip James and Charley Patton. The blues seemed like perfect fodder for Nick Cave's songwriting with its imagery of floods, unfulfilled love, lust and death.  \\"The Firstborn Is Dead\\" takes you on a rain swept journey to where Elvis Presley was born in \\"Tupelo.\\"  Cave almost affects an Elvis like croon at points in the song as The Bad Seeds percussively mimic the jaunty ride of a train.

The Bad Seeds reflect a meditative tone on opening lament \\"Sad Waters.\\" The cabaret atmosphere of \\"The Carny\\" and \\"She Fell Away\\" accentuates Cave's tales of love gone horribly wrong while providing the backbone offurther attempts at the genre.  \\"Your Funeral...My Trial\\" remains the most current sounding iteration of Cave's back catalog and should be the place to start for those unfamiliar with these albums, which coincidentally are all worthy of picking up.

B000VNMMQG|3.0|Despite its intensely passionate story, the film, itself, was a notch above boring.  It moved slowly, its momentum ebbing in several places, followed by rapid catch up.  While lovely to watch, what was noteable about the film was that Albert Finney stole it.  His John Newton was brilliant, as was Romola Garai's Barbara Spooner.  The story of Wilberforce was compelling and educational, but those endearments were largely extrapolated and not inherent in the film, itself.
0385338732|4.0|This book was an easy sit by the pool read...just what I was looking for.  No thinking necessary.
0385341008|5.0|What a fantastically quirky little book!<br /><br />I was initially a bit put off by the format of \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,\\" as reading a series of letters between people you know nothing about is rather tedious.  But I quickly forgot about that as I got into the story itself.  Certain aspects of WWII are a source of fascination for me, and I found that this book showed me a new angle.  I never knew that the Channel Islands were occupied by the Germans, and even if I had, I don't know that I ever would have thought too deeply about how that would affect the everyday lives of the residents.  But this is a great subject, and the authors have done a beyond credible job creating unique characters that the reader truly begins to care about, even though events are only told through the perspectives of a select few.  Juliet is a wonderful woman, witty and imaginative, and I admire her initiative and her mind.  Kit is a darling, Amelia the type to make one feel welcomed and loved, Sidney the best friend every woman would love to have, Isola a character that cannot be summed up in a few simple adjectives.  I was rooting for them all at the end, and was thrilled with the way the story concluded (despite my desire for more).<br /><br />I ate through this one in an afternoon.  Pick it up and you won't regret it!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Man this is dark and beautiful at the same time.  Its the old with the new.  Problably the best western of older guys trying to be young. Mr. Eastwood did a fine job. Easily one of the best westerns of all time, definetly a top 10 Western.  It has a little bit of Outlaw Josie Wells in it as well as High Plains Drifter mixed in with it.
0446402397|4.0|Too often a novelist illustrates a time or place different from our own with copious physical detail while neglecting the effect of the society on a character's development and actions.  Tom Rob Smith accomplishes both goals in \\"Child 44.\\"  The Soviet setting is a chilling reminder of a time and place not too far gone when man thought he could remake human nature, and the evils that emanate from that seemingly noble aspiration.  There are no problems with Smith's prose.  His characterizations by and large seem real, although one character, Leo's nemesis in the State Police, is a bit cartoonish.  The action skips around Russia in time and place, but the plot flows logically.  Two issues prevent a fifth star.  One, 50 pages could have come out.  Two, the plot resolves with a twist that depends too much on coincidence.  Although I understand the attractiveness of the resulting \\"neat\\" ending, based on the first half of the book I expected a more ambitious effort from Mr. Smith.
B000092T6M|4.0|Alan Rickman as the Sheriff absolutely steals this film. Kevin Costner is alright but as the only one sounding like an American, and the only one taking this seriously, he is a bit out of place. However, I found Morgan Freeman amusing and I adore the Friar. He really took a small role and made it wonderful and hilarious. Many snappy one liners, great film!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie is just amazing. It shows how strong true love can be, no matter what comes next, no matter what goes on now. True love is on still, even in times we face nowadays, where people merely care about anyone's feelings...true friendship and love last forever and ever.    By the way, the delivery arrived sooner than expected! It has been awesome!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|First, there is a male ballad duet. Do I really need to say more? Johnny Depp makes a wonderful Todd, bringing loads of dark humour to this film. Bonham Carter was a suprise joy and Alan Rickman as Jude Turpin is perfect as usual (but I love him so don't take my word for it). Pirelli makes me crack up every time. I'm not fond of the young lad as Anthony, he seemed more like a creeper. Or of the music they cut. Yes, some was needed but the title song? Really? But did I mention there was a male ballad duet?
B000002UD0|5.0|This is a magnificent Cd. Made in John's \\"long weekend\\" with May Pang.  Jon Lennon was a character and his songs stay with you, they linger in your mind when you wake from deep sleep. CD arrived  asfely and smoothly.  Henk B.
0800141660|5.0|The acting in this movie is great all the way around, but my particular favorites being Alan Rickman as Col. Brandon, (a few of his lines literally take my breath away) and the young sister, Margaret. Hugh Grant is extremely charming and the ladies are wonderful as well. I find this movie, and the whole story really, to pale in comparison to Pride and Prejudice. It seems like a condensed version of that story. However, there are parts that make it wonderful in itself and it's a great film to watch with your girlfriends. I find my husband doesn't quite swoon the way I do. =)

B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground is the band's eponymous 1969 album, their third studio album. John Cale was gone, replaced by Doug Yule on bass and organ. The personnel were now Lou Reed, who wrote all the songs, plays guitar and sings, Sterling Morrison on guitar, Maureen Tucker on drums, and Doug Yule. Making this album was a happy experience with everyone working together. The album is a departure from their first two, mainly because the songs are quieter and calmer. They have gone from songs about heroin making you feel like Jesus' son to songs about Jesus, with no apparent irony. Though Rock Critic Lester Bangs didn't even like the song when the album first came out, \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" has proved to be the most enduring track, with several bands and performers covering it. It has appealed to punk rockers, country singers, R.E.M., and Courtney Love of Hole.<br /><br />\\"What Goes On\\" is also popular, in a medium tempo rock groove that is catchier than you think. It sneaks up on you, and before you know it, you're hooked on the hook. \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" is in a similar vein. Funny that both songs rip off lyrics from jazz standards, with \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" also being the title of a Duke Ellington number, and the refrain of \\"What Goes On\\" saying \\"Lady Be Good,\\" which is a Gershwin tune.<br /><br />In my review of The Days of Wine and Roses by The Dream Syndicate I ranted about how unoriginal it was to take titles from old songs as the basis for your own songwriting, but I guess they were only following Lou Reed's lead. The Dream Syndicate wanted so bad to be The Velvet Underground, but in that they showed excellent taste. I was just kidding around in that review, but I got nothing but negative reaction. One comment simply called me an idiot.<br /><br />The drummer, Maureen Tucker, sang the final song, \\"After Hours\\" because Lou Reed felt it needed a pure and innocent voice, not a sneering and cynical one. Maureen sings it as a happy little ditty, somewhere between a show tune and a summer camp sing along.<br /><br />\\"The Murder Mystery\\" is an eight minute plus experimental track that soon grows tiresome, but other than that, all the songs are listenable, with a few real gems.<br /><br />\\"Candy Says\\"<br /><br />Candy says I'd like to know completely<br />what others so discretely talk about<br /><br />Doug Yule sang this one, the opening track, with a sweet and pretty voice. It's about Candy Darling, who was a Warhol hanger on, and s/he would also make an appearance in \\"Walk On The Wild Side\\" in 1972.<br /><br />\\"What Goes On\\"<br /><br />What goes on in your mind?<br />I think that I am upside down.<br />Lady, be good, do what you should, you know it will work out right.<br /><br />This is my second favorite song on the album. It has a sloppy but good groove, and the guitar (or is it an organ?) solo really knocks me out. It is very simple, but it says so much.<br /><br />\\"Some Kinda Love\\"<br /><br />and some kinds of love<br />the possibilities are endless<br />and for me to miss one<br />would seem to be groundless<br /><br />I like this one, it is a very loose groove, with the words flowing, seemingly at random.<br /><br />\\"Pale Blue Eyes\\"<br /><br />It was good what we did yesterday.<br />And I'd do it once again.<br />The fact that you are married,<br />Only proves, you're my best friend.<br />But it's truly, truly a sin.<br />Linger on, your pale blue eyes.<br />Linger on, your pale blue eyes.<br /><br />\\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" was inspired by Shelly Albin who had pale blue eyes. She was his girlfriend from college, and some of Lou's other songs are also about her. I wonder if she later got married but still saw Lou, as the lyrics state. This song is really a great song, in my opinion. It has just enough detail in the lyrics to sketch a picture, but whoever sings it can bring their own emotions to it. Eric Andersen, Alejandro Escovedo, Neil Finn, Counting Crows, Hole, Marisa Monte, R.E.M., Tom McRae and Patti Smith have all covered \\"Pale Blue Eyes.\\" In Julian Schnabel's 2007 film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly there is an instrumental version, and the song was also used in the 2008 film August.<br /><br />\\"Jesus\\"<br /><br />Jesus, help me find my proper place<br />Help me in my weakness<br />'Cos I'm falling out of grace<br />Jesus<br />Jesus<br /><br />Those are just about the complete lyrics to this song, and it repeats that same set of lyrics a few times through. Lou Reed sings this one in a very pretty voice, and the arrangement is very beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Beginning to See the Light\\"<br /><br />Some people work very hard,<br />But still they never get it right.<br />Well, I'm beginning to see the light.<br /><br />I like this song just as much as \\"What Goes On\\" but that is because they are practically the same song.<br /><br />\\"I'm Set Free\\"<br /><br />And now I'm set free<br />I'm set free<br />I'm set free to find a new illusion<br /><br />This song didn't make much of an impression on me.

B001A2ADFE|5.0|I have always liked the Blind Faith album, but like so many records at the time I never had to buy it because either it was always on the radio, or all my friends had it.  I decided that I wanted it when I heard Clapton's guitar break in \\"Presence of the Lord\\".  I bought the CD ( also with the \\"naughty\\" cover ) because it is a part of Americana-even though it was the British cover.  I then decided that I wanted the vinyl record because I collect things ( coins, stamps, etc ).  The LP did come with wrapping as advertised, and although I think it was made in Germany, it did have the British cover.  Lastly, I think more LPs with the British cover were sold in the US than LPs with the American cover!
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I read all four Twilight fantasy books because I work with kids and adolescents and need to keep up on trends, fads, and discussion points.  The Twilight series, however, is more than merely a work of fantasy. If I were the parent of a pre-teen or teen, I don't think that I would approve of my child reading the entire series (as if a parent could stop a teen or pre-teen from doing something they're hell-bent on doing anyway). At times, the events are disturbing. The violence and bloodletting are rather vivid as the books progress, and death is central to the action in each book.     This fourth in the series book was the best of the bunch since there is more real action and mystery, albeit through bloody events. The first three books portrayed high school students experiencing what can typically be called \\"puppy love.\\" This fourth book took Edward and Bella to the stage of newlyweds and parents in a very discrete, yet believable, manner. Although I'm certainly not a prude, I appreciated the fact that sex was dealt with in a very delicate manner since younger kids are reading the book, also.     My discussions with pre-teens indicate that although they know that vampires and werewolves probably are not real, the existence of these beings could...yes, COULD...happen.  The overall theme that pre-teens take away from the Twilight series is that people(and animals)come in all shapes and sizes, and prejudice is alive and well in both real and fantasy worlds.     Footnote: The descriptions of the town of Forks and the rainy Pacific Northwest were very real and well done. Yes, it does rain a lot in the fall, winter, and spring here in the PNW, but the summers are glorious!     Cherie Renfrow Starry  Private Practice Counselor/Therapist
0061231401|5.0|With The Doomsday Key, James Rollins creates an intelligent and exciting adventure that unites the passion of an international thriller with a collection of fascinating mysteries culled from several thousand years of history.<br /><br />This is a non-stop, high action, intellectual read which left me at the edge of my seat; addicted, hanging on for dear life, and riding 100 miles per hour. Without a doubt James Rollins' latest is an incredible read which will satisfy the cerebral craving for science and the heart-felt craving for excitement.<br /><br />Once again Sigma, the uber-top-secret military force is back. This time Commander Grayson Pierce, Monk Kokkalis, Joe Kowalski and even Director Painter Crowe must get in on the action to save the world from the most deadly and globally devastating crisis yet.<br /><br />Traveling around the globe - from Africa to Rome to Norway to Ireland to France -  the Sigma team races to understand the connection of an ancient symbol seared into the foreheads of murder victims on two separate continents and a unique relic found near the Vatican.<br /><br />Guild spy Seichan returns, more sexy, double-crossing, and villainous than ever. Her hidden secret entices the Sigma team into even more harrowing circumstances and may kill them all before they are able to find the doomsday key answer.<br /><br />The Doomsday Key is an enthralling read that provides rich food for thought about Vatican mysteries, eco-science, and what some deem humankind's greatest threat.<br /><br />Read this book - it is fun, fast, and not for the faint of heart! While the action is fantastic, the real staying-up-all-night addiction is in seeing how Rollins creatively weaves the emotional connections between team members with the tale to link crimes in separate continents.  If you are addicted to fast-paced, emotional, wind-in-the-hair, racing against the clock action, you will love this book as much as I do. Read it!
0143038419|1.0|Dang, I was expecting so much more from this book! I wanted to give the book NO STARS in this review, but the software wouldn't allow it. I have to settle for 1 STAR, but even that's too many. It seems that people either really, really LIKE THIS BOOK or that people really, really DISLIKE THIS BOOK. Count me in the latter category. But, I really used to like Elizabeth Gilbert's work. What happened...?     \\"What a totally self-centered person,\\" I thought as I struggled through the first half of the book. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY tried to LIKE this book because I knew in the first 20 pages I would NEVER LOVE IT. I was expecting Ms. Gilbert to write more about cultures. I was wrong... It's all about ME...ME...ME rather than about cultural acceptance.     Wouldn't it be nice if everyone could just pick up and leave friends and family and other responsibilities to travel the world and eat, have sex, eat some more, have sex some more, and--oh yes--investigate and ponder why God (or some intelligent being, if you like) made ME so special?!     Many of my friends liked this book and said it spoke to them. Now, I have very wonderful and intelligent friends, but I can't seem to find or relate to the concepts they describe as being life-altering or life-clarifying. Perhaps it's just ME. Oh, no--I seem to have caught the ME-SYNDROME (officially known as Narcissistic Personality Disorder)that I so clearly despised in this book!    I wouldn't recommend this book to my clients as a therapeutic approach or aid to their mid-life crisis angst. Instead I'd encourage each of them to not waste money on this book; save up for a real cruise/trip with real people...    ...and I can't remember the last time I used the word \\"really\\" as often as I did in this review or as many upper-case letters or exclamation points to show how I felt about a book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've watched it with my family, loaned it to a friend and watched it alone.

1400063736|4.0|Let the Great World Spin by Colum McCann is a lovely, lovely read, lyrical and beautifully written.  The novel centers around a number of perhaps seemingly unconnected people in 1974 New York and their lives at the time Philippe Petit walked between the World Trade Center towers.  Let the Great World Spin is not a quick read.  The writing is slow moving at times, and must be savored. McCann draws tenuous connections between all of his characters, stressing that we are all somehow connected. Petit, whose act is just background here, gets through his day unscathed, but McCann's characters are not as lucky, but life goes on, the great world spins.   If you are inclined to enjoy lovely writing that will make you think, pick this one up.  It is a delightful read.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Ron Fricke and Co deserve the acclaim that this film has received over the years. It is without a doubt the best film i have ever seen for visuals. Thanks to Blu Ray technology, the film is extended ten fold in clarity, rawness and depth. I viewed the film on my ps3 console through my 32\\" HD television at 1080i resolution and it was crystal clear. My next task is to view it on a much larger screen! Be careful however if you are  buying the region 'A' version and you live in Europe... it won't play. It must be a region 'B' copy. All in all, this film goes beyond cinematography, its has become an art form in its own right.
B000HKV7OG|5.0|One of the most misrepresented novels in 20th century literature, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is best remembered for the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name. Set in the near future (from 1962), the Britain it portrays is a liberal socialism with a repeatedly elected government. The anti-hero of the work is 15-year old Alex, a fairly bright lad but lacking any moral values (no redeeming qualities). Like many in his group he hooks up with fellow sociopaths into a criminal gang that beats, robs, rapes, and eventually murders their way through a bleak landscape. It is a culture, strangely familiar, where people prey on one another, or get preyed upon.<br /><br />Young Alex is eventually caught in the act of murdering a wealthy aged widow in attempting to rob her. His power play in gang politics forced them to set him up and he was convicted for fourteen years in State Jail... After less than two years an opportunity presents itself with the emergence of a new technology claiming that criminals can be permanently rehabilitated within a fortnight. After much manipulation Alex is selected as a candidate for the treatment. It turns out to be behavior modification of a particularly nasty sort, but Alex is released, with the promise that he is a new man, entirely prophetic. There is debate over man's capacity for goodness and moral choice, seen from  liberal Christian vs. pragmatic viewpoints.  After a series of misadventures Alex's past comes back with a vengence, forcing him to attempt suicide with the support of the government's enemies.<br /><br />Where most interpretations of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" go wrong is to base their assumption on the movie. Colourful, glitzy, with a stirring soundtrack, the first twenty minutes of the film stick in the mind and all the subtleties of the novel are left unobserved. The argument is over the right of the individul to make a moral choice. Pavlovian dogmas that assume society and  it's representatives should overrule objections to their role in guiding men  forget about fascism and communism. Author Burgess was well aware of the abuses of power and it's role in a \\"free\\" society. When man loses the choice to make a moral decision, he loses the essence of what makes a human being. This work should be seen as a modern sequel to Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" and a seminal representation of science fiction. This edition includes a glossary for the slang used by the teens in the work. It is a mix of Russian and Gypsy, with added English derivatives.

In this book he tries to examine success and therefore studies Bill Gates, Mozart and others and determines they had to practise and have a lot of luck. Geez...Ya think?   His worse mistake is his examination of Affirmative action at the University of Michigan. He concludes although minority students are allowed in despite lower scores they are just as succesful after school so therefore it is justified to select based on race. He fails to metion affirmative action continues into the workplace. Is he really this sheltered or his he ignoring the facts for his politics.  He then continues to make excuses for poor math performance in Western countries saying that it is because of the roots of language. I guess he has never spent anytime in Asia and watched kids starting intensive math at 3 years old. Here he throws out the \\"practise\\" concept for math ability and chaulks it up to language.  These are some of his key points...there is no real value or orginal idea in this book.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This classic looks and sounds great remastered for DVD. Highly recommended for fans whose old VHS's have just about had it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I have seen Michael Jackson on television but never in a live performance.  This DVD puts you up front and close for the concert and it is AWESOME! Unfortunetely I bought the DVD posthumously and it saddens me when I remember this unvelievable talent is no longer alive.  But, watching the DVD does keep MJ alive, full of energy and music. His dancing is mesmerizing and his foot work is unbelievable. The staging, the pyrotechnics, the constumes, the musicians, back up dancers.....all left me breathless. Any collection of Michael Jackson CDs/DVDs must include a live performance and I highly recommend this concert.  You won't be disappointed and if you've never been an MJ fam you will be after you see this performance. He was and is the master of live entertainment and will always be the King of Pop. The DVD is amazing!!
B001MTENOC|5.0|I just finished reading this book last night.  I couldn't put it down.  I am dissappointed to learn that I'll have to come back and do it all again, and I'm most likely a beginner soul...  I'd like to try the past life regression hypnotherapy to find out where I am.  This books covers all that I've been seeking all my life, so now I know - what is left?  Atleast I have an idea of what I'm working toward.  I've read other stuff and there are connections and simularities of after life/spirit world.  I find myself looking at my 21 month old grandson and thinking, are you here?  You have to read the book to know what I'm talking about...  I'm on to the next book 'destiny of souls'.
0440246016|5.0|Okay, Bad Luck and Trouble is CLASSIC Reacher!  Someone made the mistake to throw one of Reacher's old MP buddies out of a chopper......big mistake! Oh Lordy, what a big mistake. Then one by one, someone is killing off Reacher's old MP buddies he knew \\"back in the day\\". Reacher then assembles who can find from his old MP squad to find who's responsible and make them pay.  When Reacher finds out who's doing this, it's going to be bad luck and trouble for them.  Could it be someone from Reacher's past, or an all new threat?  This is such a great read, and I highly suggest you pick this up and enjoy the Reacher ride. If you've read Reacher books in the past, then you know what you're in for. If you haven't read a Reacher book before, then welcome to the party.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|When you have a star like Michael Jackson who has produced many great songs in the 40+ years he spent performing it seems like it would be hard to narrow his career down to two-discs, but for the most part the \\"Essential\\" series has done it again bring up a summary of the career of The King of Pop.  We get to greatest hits from his days in the Jackson 5, to The Jacksons, and of course, finally we make our way to his legendary solo-career.  It gives you a sense of the evolution his music underwent over the decades.<br /><br />If you're a new fan of the International Star, or as a long time fan would like a nice playlist of his hits, this CD is very well compiled.  My only complaint was the omission of his \\"Earth Song\\" and some of his other, more recent work would have been a nice addition to make the listener really comprehend the changes in his music.  Aside from that it is almost a perfect summary of Michael Jackson's career.<br /><br />'The Essential Michael Jackson' on its two CDs certainly showcases the talent of a man who was perhaps the greatest entertainer to ever walk to face of the Earth, with his ability to bring about many emotions in his various songs, from being sweet, to rough, Michael had to ability to change his approach on and off the stage.<br /><br />Notable songs include:<br />I Want You Back<br />ABC<br />Don't Stop Until You Get Enough<br />Thriller<br />Beat It<br />Billie Jean<br />Bad<br />You Are Not Alone<br />Smooth Criminal<br />Black or White<br />And many, many more.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It is my personal opinion that The Godfather 1 & 2 are probably the greatest films ever made.  So of course I owned them on VHS... then I bought them again on DVD... and Now I'm the proud owner of the entire trilogy (plus a bunch of extras and an over sized booklet) on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Was it worth the money to buy this set again?  I guess it depends on who you are and what you like.  First of all, I generally prefer theatrical versions to any other versions of films - there are a few exceptions of course, but on the whole I prefer the theatrical release - which is what these BDVDs are.  Many people will not be huge fans of the graininess of the film or the orange hue of the film.  Expecially if you are used to watching the extremely sharp and crisp newer movies released on Blu-ray.  But there is something about that grainy texture and warm lighting that makes this film seem all the more immediate, they welcome the viewer in and you quickly forget yourself in the rise and fall of Michael.<br /><br />So yes to me the investment was well worth the purchase, we have watched these movies hundreds of times and it feels like every time I catch yet another subtle nuance, gesture or deeper meaning.<br /><br />Others will find this to be a waste of their hard earned money - they just want to see the movie.  Some people are content to just watch it when it comes on A&E - but to the true fans, the upgrade to Blu-ray is a must.
B001VEJ2G2|5.0|I purchased this on a recent trip to the UK, because I heard and loved Bulletproof, a single that hit #1 there.  In my opinion, 9 of the 12 tracks are five-star standouts, and Tigerlily is epic.  It stalks me.  I can't get it out of my head.  The entire album is artistically brilliant synthpop.  My least favorite track, Armour Love, is still very nice, but it reminds me of some TV commercial from the 70s, so that's somewhat distracting.  I have been listening to La Roux nonstop for the last two weeks and I LOVE IT.  This is probably my favorite album since Upstairs at Eric's.
0061438294|5.0|Former FBI Agent, Joe Navarro, knows what he's talking about & knows what every body is saying, for that matter.  This book is the crown jewel of the study of body language, written by a certifiable expert.  Anyone who intelligently discusses the limbic part of the brain (a new one on me) isn't to be taken lightly; and for good reason.  His expertise is impressive, as are his credentials.<br /><br />This book is the definitive book on the subject of body language that I've ever come across.  Although it's possible for those devious people with hidden agendas to play a game of deception, sooner or later, with enough observation, they can be read like a book; in fact, this book!
B0029358GM|4.0|I was looking forward to the release of this album but feel a little let down after listening.  It just doesn't rock.  It's missing one critical thing in my opinion.  There isn't one decent guitar solo on the whole album!  After listening multiple times, I'm still waiting for every track to break out in one of those tortured guitar solos that are so typical on Wilco albums.  But the solos never come!  I don't know much about producing music, but I CAN HEAR the guitar solos in MY MIND and would have insisted that the band add a few here and there throughout the cd.  But that's probably why I'm stuck in this dead end job and not producing rock bands.
6305127697|5.0|Primal Fear is an excellent legal thriller movie, with outstanding performances from Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and especially Edward Norton (in his first movie role, and one of his best), who steals almost every scene he appears in.     The excitement goes from start to finish, with many plot twists to keep you in suspense, the biggest of these right at the end of the film, when you least expect it...    If you're a fan of legal/thriller movies (or even if you just like Edward Norton), don't miss out on this one! I would have seen it sooner if i'd known about it.
1577314808|1.0|I was looking for a book that promoted higher thinking or even had a good motivational story... unfortunately this was not that book.    It was the most difficult book I have ever read. It felt like I was reading someone's rambles...very repetetive and unorganized.

B000JLSM00|5.0|A classic piece of John Ford cinematography that anyone owning a BluRay player would be proud to have in their collection. Remember this movie was shot in the 1950s and even today people would be amazed at the work that John Ford put into making this as authentic as possible. The behind the scenes segments were simply unbelievable.    I am proud to own this movie. You should get it because works like this are just not done in modern filmmaking.
0316096199|5.0|This book was a real eye opener for me.  Thankfully, myself and anyone I know have ever been raped.  It is truly amazing to me what a rape victim must go though with police, family, freinds, lawyers, etc always questioning and accusing. Now I understand why many victims do not even bother to come forward after being raped.  It doesn't even seem worth it.  How heartbreaking!    How dare any of us give this book less than 5 stars, it would be nothing less than a slap in the face to this courageous victim.
0385341008|2.0|So many said this book was wonderful and I just didn't see what others saw.  It was so predictable.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you even remotely like the Beatles music, you should love this movie. I really got caught up in the love story, the friendships, and the great interpretations of classic songs.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This series was one of the best I've seen on the current ongoing war.  I'm a VietNam Vet and my heart and prayers go out to the man and women serving and protecting our Country.  This is a must see.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Simply put, I am delighted with this flash.  For under $120 you really can't afford not to get it.  The difference it gives in lighting your subject is amazing.  Gives people natural skin tones and wonderful eye detail (no more red-eye).  I posted some photos above (taken with Nikon D40) and all were taken in a basement with no lights on.  My cats eyes were very detailed and no glare, red-eye, or any distortion whatsoever.  Beautiful detail.   My son's skin tone is natural looking as if he was shot in daylight.   A very nice feature, you can turn the flash 90 degrees and bounce off the ceiling!  In my opinion, this is a must have, worth every penny.
0596007124|1.0|I really can't think of anything good to say about this book. It is, hands-down, the most disappointing technical book I have ever bought (and I buy an obscene amount of them).    To be fair, I don't think it purports to be a reference. But I'm not sure what it *is* good for. I've picked it up a number of times since I bought it, but so far, I have always simply put it back on the shelf in exasperation. It's vaguely reminiscent of some kind of 3rd grade workbook you might have used. I don't necessarily hold that against its producers, but if you haven't actually seen the content, be advised.    I don't know how typical it is of the series, but I don't see me buying another Head First book unless I have the chance to examine it beforehand (which, I suppose, I should have done prior to buying this one).
B0011GHK28|5.0|I missed this tape of \\"Thriller\\" when it came along some time ago.  Now, in my car, I can take the time to listen closely to a classic!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|This series is like most HBO shows, raw, funny, and willing to show emotions in different ways.  I've read the book and like the changes they've made to the series.  The show brings to light the prejudices and preconceived notions that people have in real life toward African Americans, Transgenders, and now Vampires.  I really enjoy the way that Vampires are portrayed as another minority group in American society.  There are parallels drawn to other minority groups as well as the hatred and fear that some people have.  The relationships  in the series are dysfunctional, and yet they are real exaggerations of the relationships we all have in our own lives.  Very entertaining and I look forward to the second season.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie romp, a great Woody Allen fun piece.<br /><br />It's about three women pondering their existential selves and their love lives.  The existential angst is serious and is dealt with through life experience which is mostly their love lives.  Their love lives create the angst that they deal with and so forth.<br /><br />Javier Bardem plays a charismatic Spanish artist who was married to Penelope Cruz.  Their marriage could not last because it was too tumultuous.  Scarlett Johansson and her friend are visiting Spain and Javier Bardem invites them to his small town for a weekend romp.  What ensues is the meat of the movie.<br /><br />I loved the narration but I imagine that others might find it a bit cloying.  It's a fun movie for a late summer's night.  You'll think of your youth, the sun and stars, and the passions that cry out in all of us.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I loved the DVD so much that after purchasing a BluRay player had to get this one.  Great performances, great guests, great stirring experience.  We are very big Chris Botti fans.  He had a fantastic band too with drummer virtuoso Billy Kilson.
B002HEOLFW|5.0|This cd is a COMPLETE improvement off the self titled release back in 06.  The hard songs rock harder and the soft songs tug at the heart strings more, basically Daughtry brings it on this one...so don't be a loser buy this cd!!!!
B0028T6XXY|3.0|only disappointment is the dvd is more behind the scenes and less presentation of the concert.  he is great but would be better to just dvd the show.   he is cocky but also sensitive.  good combo I guess.  my wife is big fan
1439157383|5.0|This book is a great example of what the other children in a disabled family go through. I think the book shows that it's not just the patient who deals with the pains of surgery, the scars from chemo, and the loss of things. I love this book and I think it's way better than the movie!!
B001VS46DC|3.0|I was concerned after all the attention given to her marriage to elvis costello and having children that the music might become secondary.  this is an intimate performance in Rio but a little sleepy.  also too much audience sing along although done in portugese is interesting.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Great series, some of the actors aren't great, but overall the series is fun, entertaining, and has me hooked. It's not a fine work of art but it is enjoyable and if you like vampires then I highly recomend checking it out.
B001R0KH3M|4.0|great music lasting well over time.  stevie is getting on in years and pounds but has lost nothing musically.  the sing along is a distraction in otherwise top notch dvd
0307266303|5.0|A terrific book.  If you've ever experienced the \\"joy\\" of running you will find yourself saying, \\"yes I've felt that way before\\".  Very well written and holds your attention.  I don't agree with the evolutionary premise but I've learned to ignore that in most books.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Purchased as a gift for our 7 year old grandson...he loved this movie.   Should be a keeper in the family library.

B001O5114O|4.0|Believe it or not, in the town where I live, there are still working Cowboys (at least there were when we moved here). The first High School I attended actually had some kids they used as extras in the John Wayne movie [[ASIN:B000O599WQ The Cowboys (Deluxe Edition)]].<br /><br />The other day I was having lunch with a friend of mine who was looking back on his life, and saying the best working times of his life were working as a cow hand and as a pack-master (packing mules)go figure. In any case, he always says his favorite movie is [[ASIN:B001BGS16M The Outlaw Josie Wales]],but recently he said that he liked Appaloosa so well that that might be his #1.<br /><br />So, on this strong recommendation, I ordered the download from Amazon Video on demand, and while I am not over the moon for this film like my friend is, Appaloosa is a very good \\"Western\\" movie. Appaloosa fails with some silliness at times, which I assume was the fault of the author if anything, but some realistic gritty gunfights, and the old fashioned \\"Code of the West\\" is certainly alive and well.<br /><br />3 ¾*
B000066C1N|5.0|I am not usually a fan of soundtracks where a composer (Hans Zimmer) and a mainstream artist (Bryan Adams) collaborate but on this soundtrack the move is pulled off very well.  Both the songs and orchestral pieces are very well done and can be listened to for hours on end without growing weary.  Bryan's songs really add additional meaning to the movie and soundtrack and Zimmer's majestic pieces really take one in to the heart of the film.
B000HEZF0O|4.0|MI:1 might be the best of the three, although MI:3 was terrific.  The second offering was ok at best, but still a great Blu-Ray bundle to add to your collection!  Can't beat the price for three quality action movies!
B001VS46DC|4.0|I find her performances on video to be more interesting than the CDs. She is very pleasant in her spoken personal comments and to watch.  Her accent, which I assume is Canadian, adds to the performance. Her comments regarding her family and the likelihood that will be with her in Brazil when she next appears there were touching.  I enjoyed this as did my visitors.
0375701427|5.0|\\"What on earth is less reprehensible than the life of the Levovs?\\"  That is the question that Nathan Zuckerman asks in Philip Roth's American Pastoral.  This is one of his best novels (I've always preferred the elder Roth to the younger Roth).  It tells the story of \\"Swede\\" Levov (\\"rhymes with `love'\\"), the classic all-American boy: athletic, stunningly handsome, smart, patriotic, moral, diligent, eager-to-please.  Levov was one a childhood hero of Zuckerman.  One day, in his seventies, the Swede asks to meet with Zuckerman about writing the story of his father's life.  Over dinner, Levov strikes Zuckerman as hopelessly banal.  \\"I was wrong,\\" Zuckerman says.  \\"Never more mistaken about anyone in my life.\\"    Like The Human Stain, this novel is somewhat metafictional; Zuckerman has a passing acquaintance with a remarkable man and decides to write a novel about him.  He is upfront with the reader that he is making the particulars of this story up - guessing about what he can never know.  But that is neither here nor there.  What the novel is ultimately about is the arbitrariness of life - the Swede does everything right but is hit by a catastrophe so random that no one could have predicted it.  Whether or not that is the fault of \\"America\\" is up to the judgment of the reader.
1577314808|1.0|I read this book with a group of people who met monthly to discuss 2 or 3 chapters.  Many of the people in the group loved the book.  I (and three others, one of whom is my wife) despised it.  The fundamental reason that we despised it was the seemlingly limitless arrogance displayed by Mr. Tolle in his writing.      Please know that I LIKE the concept of mindfulness, meditation, Buddhism, etc.  I simply don't like Eckhart Tolle. In fact, I believe he is worse than arrogant.  I believe Mr. Tolle's primary goal in writing this book is to promote himself to the level of prophet in the eyes of the public.  He uses a number of techniques to achieve this end.  Let me give some examples:    *In the preface to the paperback edition, he references a Time Magazine review that calls his work \\"mumbo jumbo.\\"  His counter to this is that \\"countless people around the globe found [it] life changing.\\"  And \\"...any teaching that puts the spotlight of attention on the workings of the ego will necessarily provoke egoic reaction, resistance, and attack.\\"  So basically lots of people like it and if you don't get it, you are confused or flawed.  So there is no way to take issue with anything he says. I think Adolph Hitler could have used this same agrument (STOP RIGHT THERE! I am NOT comparing Tolle to Hitler! I'm just saying his argument could have been used by the Nazis to justify their existance).    *He then has his story of transformation like Jesus in the desert for 40 days.  He claims that after becoming extremely suicidal, he woke up in a peaceful bliss and sat on a park bench for 3 years and did nothing.  He was so overtaken by the power of now that he just sat there happy.  He doesn't say anything about sleeping, eating, or bathroom breaks.  He just talks about how he sat in the now.    *In the book Mr. Tolle rarely if ever gives credit to the sources of these ideas (mainly Buddhism) except to mention it a few times in passing.  In fact, there is NO indication that any of theseideas came from anywhere besides Mr. Tolle's head.  He discusses Jesus and the Buddha but if you look carefully you see they are simply colleagues in the endeavor to enlighten us simple folks.  He is one of them.    *He uses questions and statements in italics to represent the student of his teachings.  The ideas and questions attributed to the \\"student\\" are almost always off-base, wrong, and confused.  But Mr. Tolle patiently corrects and enlightens us.    I suspect that he is hoping that eventually the story about the three year bench-sit will morph into \\"He sat for three years without moving, no sustenance, etc.\\"  Sainthood, here we come...    This is just my opinion, mind you, and I realize that this review is a bit snarky but please understand that it is my honest take on the book.  I could not read The Power of Now before bed because I'd get so angry at his con man techniques that I couldn't sleep.  It's snark from the heart.    So if you decide to read this book, keep one eye open.  You may be getting conned.
B00000DQWT|5.0|It's great when you experience music and just know all the elements came together perfectly and something special and lasting was created. That's the case with Pat Metheny's soundtrack for The Falcon and the Snowman. Typically one doesn't run to movie soundtracks for cutting-edge music but these original compositions from roughly 20yrs ago accomplished what terrific music should be: stirring arrangements (by great talents) that are unique, captivating and possess a timeless quality. I had the album on cassette many years ago and played it regularly. After CDs took over I kept forgetting to replace it. Now I'm correcting that mistake and sharing my decades-long opinion w/others. You won't regret this music purchase. While not predonminantly upbeat and lighthearted in tone, neither is it depressing but rather, moving, exhilerating, dramatic, beautiful and laid back--all at once. It will transport you to a special place. Actually I never saw the movie and later decided not to rent it--I didn't want the movie visuals & story to disturb what could be created by my own imagination--i.e., my enjoyment of the soundtrack by itself was more important to me than forever associating it with movie images that may or may not live up to the quality of PMG's music.
B00284BMBM|4.0|Great follow up to Daughtry.  Chris' vocals are strong, really letting you into each song.  Its always been his heartfelt vocals that keep us listening.  itunes version has 3 bonus tracks!
B00260HH3K|1.0|I'm sorry to say this, but this movie is beyond terrible, you will not believe how bad this movie really is. I'm not even reviewing the DVD features because, If a movie sucks so bad why the hell would you (or I) want to watch the special features?     First off, the Main Story is severely butchered to the point where everything unrecognizable to the original. The story is told very hasty and they don't bother to explain anything, and The've also rip off ideas from other great films... Dragon ball is known for great edge of your seat fighting Anime sequences, but in this movie There aren't any good fighting scenes AT ALL! None, Zero.      Second: There are absolutely NO character development in this movie at all, Bulma comes out of Nowhere holding a gun and says: they've stolen the dragonballs can you help? And Goku helps her, for no apparent reason. they team up and find master roshi, who likes to talk while he waves his hands, for no apparent reason!?.     Third: In the Anime and Manga, the main character Goku is supposed to be a happy, fun, cheerful, energetic character that only gets mad when bad people are doing bad things. In this movie goku is nothing but a stupid teenage kid who can't get a girlfriend, ride his bike to school and spends half of the movie feeling sorry for himself. (Lame!) And The DIALONG IN THIS FILM IS THE WORST I'VE EVER HEARD!     Fourth: For unknown reasons, one of the main character, Krillin does not appear in this movie (and I don't know why?). And for more unknown CRAPtacular reasons They used The Kamehame wave, (which is suppose to be a destructive beam technique) TO revive Goku as he lays on the ground because he's about to die, over a small idiotic gun shot wound. (I'm not even afraid to spill anything for you because your not gonna go see this)     Fifth: The ending battle between Goku and Picollo is SO retarded!, Goku throws a big Kamahame wave (which looks totally fake) and all you see is bright lights, They don't even show whenpiccolo gets hit!!! It's with out a doubt the Stupidest looking, CRAPtacular actions sequence I've ever seen in a action film!     Sixth: The only relation this movie has to the original dragon ball is the Dragonballs themselves THAT'S IT! this movie should have been called The Passion, because it was 90 minutes of pure torture. This is purely Hollywood's best at Film Raping.     Seventh: if you're a FAN of Dragonball, and even if you Not a fan of Dragonball, this movie is mediocre and disappointing from the beginning to end, It's Not entertaining, there's bad acting, the costumes in this movie looks like they found them laying around in back of a trashed Halloween store. I love the original Dragonball so, if you're a fan of the original you must stay away from this!..... This film easily makes my top ten list of the worst films I have ever seen... so, OVERALL! AVOID THIS FILM...PERIOD!
B001DDBCUU|2.0|I really didn't like this movie.  Chris Noth wasn't as good as in the show and it was really empty.  Carrie had gotten a simple dress for her wedding to Big and Candace Bergen had talked her into becoming the Last Single Woman in Manhattan.  With the photo ops and such came a gorgeous dress that Carrie decided to wear and the wedding got way out of hand.  She wore a green feather in her veil.  I'm not sure what that was about.  Miranda was whining about Steve being unfaithful.  No surprise there. Charlotte FINALLY got a child.  Samantha was the same self-centered woman she always was.    If you want to see it, rent it from Netflix like I did.  Don't waste your money.  It isn't worth it to own it.  This is a one time viewing.
B00164GDD2|4.0|This blu-ray is great. While picture quality isn't phenomenal, the movie is great visually despite some heavy grain in places and dated special visual effects. The classic commentary from the dvd is as hilarious as ever and the blu-ray has other extras to pass the time. For the price and quality, I'm glad I picked this one up.
B002EULANU|3.0|I really anticipated this album to be, well the bomb, but it lacked it's sexy to me.  Please believe that I am not bashing Maxwell, I am a true fan, but for me, it was just ok.  I guess there are no stand out songs for me, nothing that I can hit repeat to.  I dunno, his voice is still on point and I love the live instruments used on the cd.  It's definitely refreshing to listen to, especially with all the garbage of music this year.  I'm sure I'll be hated for this comment, but I'm a little disappointed.  I can't wait for the 2nd installment though.  Also, glad to hear Sade is back in the studio as well.

B00284BMBM|3.0|Okay;  so I'll be the one to ride the middle of the road here along with one other reviewer so far.  I'll give this album the same rating as I did his debut.  I just don't see this as a five star outing, but that's my opinion.  For those of you on the Daughtry bandwagon then you'll give this sophomore effort nothing less.  I like Daughtry and I think he has a great voice and I was really expecting him to break out and do something different on his second release since he had more control to do what he wanted.  Yeah, I know, as one reviewer said, if it ain't broken don't fix it.  But what's wrong with thinking out of the box, being edgy and getting out of that comfort zone to make a really great album.  Overall, the album is good and each song is a catchy song if that's what you like.  But, to be honest, each song sounds like the leftover's from his debut album that never made the cut.  I'm not saying I don't like this as I have it in my mix, but I think he could have done so much more than just playing it safe and keeping it pretty generic and like his first album.  I know, it's the record business and this sells, but I was looking for more originality on this release as compared to the first release with the record company more in control.  I don't have any favorites here yet although the opening track does open up great so I thought I was in for a nice surprise, but then track two opened up and it really wasn't a surprise any longer.  No offense to any die hard Daughtry fan out there, but I was just expecting better.  I won't repeat step by step each song as other reviewer's already have done that.  With all that said, if you like Daughtry's first release then you'll be sure to love this release without even leaving your town.<br /><br />On a side note:  pick up the two bonus tracks (\\"On the Inside\\" & \\"What We Have Become\\") on I Tunes to complete this album. And then try to find the other bonus tracks that are out there: an acoustic version remake of \\"Pokerface\\", \\"Traffic Light\\", \\"One Last Chance\\", \\"Get Me Through\\", \\"Long Way\\" & don't forget the great rendition of Foreigner's classic hit \\"Feels Like the First Time\\".<br /><br />On a second side note:  the bonus tracks, if you can get them, are actually the best tracks from the album that didn't make it to the album.  Go figure.  The more I listen to this album the more I feel that Daughtry has sold out his hard rock edge and given in to cheesy top 40 pop rock.  Now, I'm starting to select the few tracks I do like to keep in my mix and there won't be as many as from his debut.  Hopefully, on his third release, if it happens down the road, he brings it all out and stays away from the sappy stuff that is found on this album.  Still three stars even if you don't agree with me here as many of you won't that rated it at five stars.Light\\", \\"One Last Chance\\", \\"Get Me Through\\", \\"Long Way\\" & don't forget the great rendition of Foreigner's classic hit \\"Feels Like the First Time\\".

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed this book. However, as I went through the story, the more I was \\"checking my watch\\" (to steal a phrase from movies). If it had been about 25% shorter, and focused on either the human story or military story, it would have been a 4 or 5 star book. Brooks' vision of the world handling an infestation of reanimated corpses taps into a discussion of humanity, politics, morals, and religion. A very fun \\"What if?\\" for any of the What-if Fans out there. A worthwhile read, and the kind of book that some will like more than others.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Amazon was the only place for me to find this DVD. It got here fast, an their price was a lot cheaper than any other retailer I would've went to. I would recommend them to anyone, and I will continue to use Amazon for any other product I may need in the future.
0060922583|5.0|Timeless read for new concept - my teenage daughter found it interesting  and broadened her horizon, she is 25 now - a book you can read again and again. Easy to comprehend, not too technical, enough to be educational without being boring.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|McDougall has written a complex and compelling story of his own journey as a runner.  More importantly though, he has brought the Tarahumara and some of ultrarunnings unknown characters to life like only a master storyteller can.
B0002C4JE4|4.0|I bought this album because I heard the song, \\"Fire & Rain,\\" and assumed that the rest of the album would also be filled with great songs.  I was WRONG.  The last song is worst of all, complete with the worst words of profanity.  Be warned in advance!  I did end up saving the songs I liked to my computer and then listed this album as for sale on my Amazon seller account.  Just an idea.  It was a disappointment when I heard this particular album which included, in my opinion, a number of \\"not so great hits.\\"
1439157383|1.0|This book was so horrible that it rendered me speechless.  I know that it is an unpopular opinion to these characters, and yet they are completely unsympathetic - Picoult finds a way to make me not feel a single pang of remorse or pity for a woman whose daughter has cancer.  How?  By making that daughter the mother of a child who smokes up, distills moonshine, and sets fires around town so that he can feel, and she just doesn't care.  By writing a trite subplot involving the anti-hero (the materialistic lawyer) and the guardian ad litem with the heart of gold.  As for the reason that they've been separated for 20 years - I've read better in drugstore romance novels).  And after all those pages of angst and whatever, their story comes to a sudden and cliche ending.    The romantic subplot's ending has nothing, though, on the novel's big finale.  It managed to be not only a cop out, but one that made me regret wasting my weekend reading this book.  The ending is so bad that it overshadowed the fact that I spent the previous 400+ pages wanting to throttle the mother.

B00284BMBM|5.0|Chris Daughtry and company return almost three years later to follow up on the release of 2006's multiplatinum self-titled debut which went on to be the highest selling album of 2007. After writing and recording his debut album while on the American Idol tour with session musicians, Daughtry, the band, comes together seamlessly on this radio-friendly follow-up. The album plays out as such.<br /><br />1. You Don't Belong To Me- 8/10<br />The heaviest of rock songs on the album. For those who enjoyed Chris' harder tracks on the first release, this will be a song you enjoy.<br /><br />2. No Surprise- 8/10<br />The first single off the album (and co-written by Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger), this tune is pop-rock in its finest form. The soaring bridge is the definite highlight of this track.<br /><br />3. Every Time You Turn Around- 8/10<br />A midtempo rocker with a solid beat, this song builds up nicely to a catchy chorus. This one definitely has single potential.<br /><br />4. Life After You- 9/10<br />The first true ballad on the album, Daughtry's raw emotion comes to the forefront in the vocals on this track. Very heartfelt, and very catchy, this song is a surefire single.<br /><br />5. What I Meant To Say- 7/10<br />A rocking song with a soaring chorus and powerful vocal delivery.<br /><br />6. Open Up Your Eyes- 9/10<br />A midtempo track with solid lyrics and an emotionally driven delivery.<br /><br />7. September- 10/10<br />An amazingly crafted acoustic gem that breaks into a midtempo rock song. Daughtry is able to show off his vocal chops on this one. This track builds throughout, leading to a huge payoff at the end. Best song on the album.<br /><br />8. Ghost Of Me- 8/10<br />An uptempo rock song with a soaring chorus that utilizes solid backing vocals and searing guitar riffs.<br /><br />9. Learn My Lesson- 7/10<br />A solid midtepmo song that doesn't quite deliver as much as the other ballads on the album.<br /><br />10. Supernatural- 9/10<br />An extremely uptempo rocking track that utilizes driving guitar riffs to create an almost manic effect throughout.<br /><br />11. Tennessee Line- 9/10<br />One of the slower paced songs on the album, this track toes the line between rock and country while never quite crossing it. An emotional ballad with excellent backing vocals, a string section, and a beautiful steel guitar ringing throughout, this is a standout on the album.<br /><br />12. Call Your Name- 9/10<br />This haunting acoustic track is a solid way to close out the album. One of the more emotional tracks on the album, Daughtry is at his best on this tune.<br /><br />If it isn't broken, why try to fix it? Daughtry doesn't produce anything earth shatteringly original with this new offering, but they do succeed immensely in crafting 12 songs that are sure to please the millions of fans who purchased their debut album. Their latest effort is chalk-full of catchy tunes that will be sure to keep Daughtry blasting away on every mainstream radio station for the next few years..

0385341008|5.0|This is a lovely, little book -- smart, funny and sensitive.  This book honors the best in all of us.  I loved everything about this book and have added Guernsey to my list of places to experience.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|I have seen this film on every single format since the 80's, from VHS to DVD, and none of them can hold a candle to the presentation on the Blu-Ray. I was floored by the clarity of the image. Starz/Anchor Bay has done a great job with the image transfer. I just wish I could say the same for the sound quality. I know that there isn't much that can be done based on the low budget mono sound recording and design that was done at the time, and who knows what the condition of the original sound elements are in, so I won't knock the rating down for that. Just to see it look as good as it does is a real treat.
0783222149|5.0|i just watched this on cable tv and wow what a great movie. i had to purchase this right after i saw it. it blows deliverance away. this is a awesome movie. holds your interest from beginning to end. this is a must see for everyone.
0765322889|1.0|I'm at Powell's books fairly often and about twice a year I wander over to the sci-fi/fantasy area to see if George R. R. Martin has put out another book in his very excellent \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  This time there was a little recommendation tag the employees had put there. \\"If you like George R. R. Martin be sure to check out Steven Erikson's 'Malazan Book of the Fallen'\\".    So, I wandered over and despite the cover, bought Gardens of the Moon.    I read the whole thing. What a mess. Towards the end it was like watching a car wreck. The author just introduces new characters or facts whenever they are convenient to him. Magical beings suddenly appear without introduction and make things better or worse as suits him. The authors was living out his assassin-mage-king dungeons and dragons fantasy and I had to suffer the double ignominy of reading this trite and paying money for the book.     SPOILERS ALERT    Near the end, one of the characters' mental monologue introduces the third and final leg of her mission: find and kill the coin bearer.  But how had she even heard of him? She had been travelling on her mission since before the coin was introduced and, as far as I could tell, her boss (a continent away) still knew nothing about the coin.     There is a several chapter buildup towards the release of one of the arch villains, and a big battle once he is finally free. But he is suddenly defeated by a magic tree that had never before been mentioned in the book. Wow, what a surprise.    So after that arch villain is defeated by a tree, then lo, a vial that has never been mentioned in the whole book is broken and a second villain is loosed, this one, even more powerful than the one we spent a third of the book expecting. Wow, what a surprise.    This book needs a warning label. It is not appropriate reading for adults or children older than 7 years of age.    Chris Perkins  Portland, Oregon.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Wow,   This was quite a project. It is an excellent CD/DVD. I like that it has both an audio cd and a DVD with video. Highly Recommended. This music really touched me, It really comes from the heart.BUY IT!!
0792163710|5.0|There is a magnificence to the look of this film and a deep and complex honesty to its characterizations -- not to be found in 99 percent of films of any type. Shane seems drawn from the weathered, weary, existentially saddened but quintessentially heroic Jesus Christ to be found in the Gospel According to Mark. The ending brings tears and goosebumps.
0646497855|5.0|Its a very good book. I had very short time to prepare for IELTS, this book has so useful tips which helped me a lot to prepare in just 15 days.     Listening and reading sections have some useful tips which prepares you for the real exam and tells you how to manage the time as well.   I improved my writing skills too.    Overall an excellent book, just go for it!
0312539517|4.0|A friend handed me Paths of Glory a few days ago.  This isn't a book I would have chosen for myself, but I found it to be an enjoyable read especially since you already know the ending.      Fast forward to my visiting Amazon only to see Publishers Weekly brutalizing Archer's \\"abysmal latest [book]\\".  Also noteworthy was that none of the praise for the author featured on the product page was for this book!    I'll speak for the unenlightened (at least when it comes to George Mallory) by saying I have none of the qualms other reviewers had.  Some wanted more depth to Mallory's character, his friends and family, etc.  Some lamented the walk down memory lane - rehashing well-known Mallory history.  This was all new to me; in fact, had it been more in-depth I can virtually guarantee I wouldn't have gotten past the first chapter.    Archer's introduction to Mallory's early years is done just right for those, like me, who don't want a full biography.  It was a series of soundbites and snippets that give a taste of Mallory's personality all the while marching the reader right up to his university years.  That's where the real story starts.  I found it to be an excellent technique, and that's what pulled me in allowing me to finish the story.    Having read the lightweight, historical fiction Paths of Glory, I can now decide if I want something more in-depth on the man.  I've decided; I don't, but I enjoyed the little I did read.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|The complete Sex & the City series. Got it cheap, although it's great quality. Fast delivery. So happy with it!!!!!
B000NQRR1Q|2.0|Fluff. With a certain Agatha Christie quality. No great meditation on Good and Evil. Just a shallow diversion to pass an evening. It descends into low comedy when Emmanuelle Seigner flies down a staircase and gives the villain a karate kick. I think a lot of people would turn the movie off at this point. As a matter of fact, I did. I couldn't imagine something further along that could justify this foolishness.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I saw David Garrett on PBS and was really impressed with the presentation.  Enough so that I bought the CD. He has made the violin show it's range from Classical to Contemporary. It all came together. He is the Master.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|If your a Lonesome Dove fan your going to love this presented on Blu-ray and \\"Widescreen\\" yes, I said widescreen! This beautiful DVD with 5.1 surround sound, digitally remastered is so crisp and clear it will put a big smile on your face. It also fills the entire 50\\" of my Panasonic Plasma Screen. What a job Genius entertainment did on this movie.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|The original \\"Star Wars\\" (A New Hope) is by far the best of all the \\"Star Wars\\" six film series. There are many memorable moments. The special edition of 1997 updated the film in line with modern filmaking techniques.
B0012CH350|5.0|A cover for my new grill seemed like a good idea, but I find that I have used this product once since I bought it. The cover is well-constructed, made of quality materials and fits nicely, but I used the grill frequently (several times a week) and just don't bother to cover it when I'm done. You have to wait until the coals are cold and by then I've forgot that I have the cover. If I weren't going to use the grill for an extended period of time then maybe it would be useful. No regrets that I bought, but wouldn't buy again because I use so seldom.
B00004TRD8|3.0|When I first saw this movie in 1992 in the cinema, I thought this is one of the best ever action/sci-fi films that had ever been made. The whole film is a visual spectacular. The direction by Jim Cameron is almost perfect. I only bought this DVD from amazon because my country's version only contains the special edition. The amazon.com version contains the special edition & the theatrical version of the film on one disc.
B000002L7Y|5.0|This album defined the mid-80's for me. For Christmas 1985, my sister and I both received our own copies of this album--no sharing this one! Even my aunt, who was in her 30's at the time, owned a copy. It truly appealed to both teenagers and older generations alike--therein lies its brilliance. What particularly impresses me, is lead singer Morten Harket's romantic distinct accent that stands out song after song and is never lost in the music-music so beautifully crafted and mature, listening to it now as an adult, I feel honored that it was the \\"soundtrack\\" to my junior high school years! Sad indeed that this style of music is gone. Bring it back!
B0006J28KU|5.0|Great Movie. Acting and directing is top notch. Easily one of the best movies of the 90s
B0028K31CE|5.0|I love this CD.  I am a die hard Maxwell fan and I thank him for coming back and growing as an artist.
0452287588|5.0|This book is so well written and precise! Easy to understand and there is so much info so that one can read it again and again!
B000RZOR2U|5.0|I have an earlier and more expensive offering of this set and echo the superlatives given by other reviewers. Whatever the meaning or intentions of the \\"historically informed\\" musical movement was or are this enterprise was it's first major triumph. And, it is true that Bach did not employ women singers. (All other recorded Cantata cycles do and you really can't go wrong - I rather like Koopman's.) Consequently the all male performance with early renditions of \\"original instrument\\" support give this set a completely unique sound. And it's beautiful. It doesn't hurt that Bach's sacred cantatas are the greatest series of musical composition in history. The boy singers are what really set this wonderfully recorded cycle apart. That's an automatic good news/bad news. The bad news is that not all of the boys are up to the blizzard of parts given them. The good news is that when they are firing on all cylinders the result is well and truly the voice of angels. And the boys and the wonderful male adults create gorgeous chorales. So, let me simply say this: if you don't have a cantata cycle get this one. If you have another Bach cantata cycle get this one too. (I have three and a half and will hit four within a year or so I'd guess.) Would a Beethoven lover be content with a single cycle of symphonies, concertos, piano sonatas or string quartets: not likely. Would a classical music lover have only one Figaro? Unthinkable. Buy this set because it one of the greatest triumph in the history of commercially recorded music. And, while you're at it, you will also have 60 CDs filled with extraordinary music.
0385341008|3.0|I loved the title when I heard it mentioned on National Public radio; but I found the book rather a disappointment. The events are both improbable and predictable, and if you are going to have a title like that, you really should have a recipe for the pie. I enjoyed it as a library book, but I would be awfully annoyed if I had paid the price of a hard cover book.
B000JNN0SM|4.0|Looking around, it seems that people like this movie better than the first Terminator. I can't say I agree.    The second movie does have things going for it. The special effects are great, and have held up pretty well. Linda Hamilton gets to play a desperate brain case, and really threw herself into the role. But I don't think Arnold is quite as convincing as a hero, not after his great, soulless, menacingly evil role in the first movie. (Insert your own joke about California, here). And the foul mouthed little punk - sorry, the future savior of mankind - was very irritating, most of the time he was on screen.    And ignoring the paradoxes (which are half the plot), would you really sent a blithely homicidal robot back to be controlled by a nasty little criminal punk of a 10 year old? You're gambling your own existence (and other peoples') on this little wacko's whims. It all gets several points for the coolness of having a kid with his very own Mega Robot of Death, but it really snapped suspension of disbelief for me. Unlike the first movie, you have to park your brain somewhere to enjoy this one. But it does repay you with a nice ride, after that.
B000ETQR3Q|1.0|I don't know if I represent the minority here, but I bought this at Target new and this piece failed to even assemble. The chamber jams and ruins the bullets.<br /><br />My mistake was I took a chance and bought this gun while browsing for a nerf toy with my kids at Target. It just so happens that my phone had no internet access in that building and I can't check the rating and bought the toy knowing if it fails I can return it to Target.<br /><br />I have owned other Nerfs before, and this is by far the worst I have bought. Judging by the low ratings, there is some serious quality control issues that Nerf needs to address with their supplier.<br /><br />I have had less problem and more fun with the BuzzBee's double-barrel shot gun so far and i thought BuzzBee were the low end imitators of Nerf.
B000000ORE|5.0|Very happy with my purchase shipped and delivered in a timely fashion did not have to wait very long. Very happy with my purchase.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|As a true Trivium fan, I love this album. They really took their time on this one and made it into a masterpiece. The drums, guitars, vocals, and production on this album is great. As many others have said, it's a mix of Ascendency and The Crusade. My only problem is that there are a few forgettable songs like 'The Calamity\\" but for the most part this is probably their best album to date. My favorite song to this point would have to be the self titled Shogun track, its just perfect. If you have any doubts about buying this album, just do it, you'll be glad you did.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Very happy with my purchase item is just as described and was delivered very quickly. Very pleased
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|This album is like Sacrament, but much, much, much better. It has that dark LOB feel to it, but its also thrashy and a great head banger. If you are a LOB fan dont hesitate to buy this album.
0446401307|5.0|I have read many Michael Connelly books.  I have never been disappointed by any of them.  The Overlook holds true to my previous statement.  Sure, this book may not be as elaborate as some of his other novels, but it was very well paced, had action, and kept me guessing up to nearly the very end.  Harry Bosche was more appealing in this novel than in the previous ones I read. It seemed like he was more compassionate and more understanding especially towards his newly assigned rookie partner.  But Bosche was still tough as nails when needed to be, and saw everything a step or two before everyone else did.  This book had me turning the pages wanting to find out what would happen next.  I recommend it, especially to those who aren't familiar with Michael Connelly's works or the Harry Bosche series.
B000B5XOYI|3.0|I would buy this if I could get it without Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  I just can't support giving Joel Schumaker any money for those endeavors.
B0029358GM|3.0|Wilco's strength has always been their ability to seemingly endlessly musically quote 60s and 70s bands.  They keep the listener guessing whether you're hearing a little snippet from an Eagles song, maybe, or, at times, a guitar riff or coda lifted from Yes or Genesis, just to mention a few.    Yankee Hotel Foxtrot saw Tweedy experimenting with his beloved Beach Boys influence by adding all kinds of electronics.  In the process, he also stumbled upon (some might argue it was his state of mind at the time) the thin line between sanity and insanity or the thin line between life as we know it and the dissolution of consciousness once we leave this life.     But I digress.    On Wilco (The Album), the electronics are for the most part gone.  The album (no pun intended....or, wait, maybe it was intended) opens with \\"Wilco/the song\\".  This is one of several instant classic rock songs in the style of the Stones or maybe Beatles at their jammingest.    Unfortunately, after several listens, I found myself pushing the \\"skip\\" button on most of the ballads.  Out of 11 songs on the record, there's about 7 keepers.  That said, for the fans who like ballads, they'll be happy with the rest of the record too.    Nels Cline is a badass guitar player.  Having seen the band play these songs at Red Rocks just a couple of weeks ago, Tweedy held his own on the guitars as well.      As mentioned above, Wilco's strength (those who didn't like 60s and 70s rock will say it's their weakness) is their ability to channel their 60s and 70s influences.    On \\"Wilco/the album\\", the single biggest influence that shines through seems to be the spirit of George Harrison and his guitar.    And that's a good thing.
B0013Y1GEQ|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />Whenever I'm asked by friends for a movie to lift up a dreary Monday evening after a tough day at the job, I reach for \\"Shall We Dance\\".<br />They then look at the outer sleeve with sneering suspicion, shake their heads and check my pulse.<br />Richard Gere and J-Lo! Ballroom Dancing!! Are you mad!!!<br />But they always come back a few days later saying how much they genuinely loved it...<br /><br />Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere play Beverly and John Clark who are happily married and living in their affluent suburban mansion. They've a well-balanced life with an equally well-balanced daughter and all seems to be in order.  But his job as a Chicago Estate Lawyer dealing with other people's wills has become tedious and their same-old existence at home quietly stagnant. One evening heading home after work on the overhead L train, John looks up into \\"Miss Mitzi's Dancing School\\" and sees a beautiful woman standing at the window (Jennifer Lopez). Several evenings and sightings later, he finally gets off the train, goes in and unwittingly enrols in Ballroom Dancing classes - and of course everything changes...<br /><br />Peter Chelsom's 2004 remake of the 1996 Japanese film \\"Shall We Dansu?\\" is as lovely as film gets - and its transition to BLU RAY is a real triumph.<br /><br />The picture is GLORIOUS throughout - far better than the DVD - beautifully framed by cinematographer John De Borman. There are so many scenes now where the detail hits you - the texture of his coat on the train home - the look of the wet streets outside the studio - his tie as he stands by the fridge in his perfect kitchen, the scuffed and scratched wooden floorboards of the Mitzi's studio - Stanley Tucci's character Link wiping false tan off his face (his Latin lothario look) as he discusses his secret passion for the Rumba and Tango with work colleague John - it 'all' looks so clear.<br /><br />As with all great films, there's a combination of things that make it work. First up is the fabulous support cast who very nearly steal the film from the leads - Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter in particular are like Bette Midler and husband - ball-breakingly funny, ratty with each other, but ultimately human and touching. There's the huge but lovable Omar trying to lose a few pounds to propose to his girlfriend (Omar Miller from 8 Mile), the macho and deceptively deep Chic played brilliantly by Bobby Cannavale (from The Station Agent) who wants to score with women (or so he thinks) - Susan Sarandon admirably downplaying the acting hysterics as John's suspicious wife who then hires Richard Jenkins (the dead father in Six Feet Under) and Nick Cannon to investigate...and on it goes to revelations none of them were expecting...<br /><br />John O'Connell did the choreography (Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge) with Richard Gere admirably putting in 4 months of intensive training to get it right. Then there's the score by John Altman during the dance numbers which is such great fun - itself sided by Gabriel Yared's beautiful piano refrain infusing so many of the quieter scenes with an old-school romance and class. And of course the movie's trump-card - the elegant, sexy and sleek Jennifer Lopez who's in her element as Paulina the spurned Ballroom champion. She wins praise from her co-cast and director - and rightly so.<br /><br />The Special Features on the BLU RAY are:<br />1. Audio commentary by the Director Peter Chelsom<br />2. Deleted Scenes (About 17 Minutes) With Commentary by Peter Chelsom<br />3. Behind The Scenes Of \\"Shall We Dance\\" - interviews with all the cast, director, producers etc<br />4. Beginners Ballroom<br />5. The Music Of (John Altman and Gabriel Yared who did the principal score; Mya's version of David Bowie's \\"Let's Dance\\" and The Pussycat Dolls update of Dean Martin's \\"Sway\\" including behind the scenes at the video shoot and interviews with Mya and Nicole Kea<br /><br />Like \\"The Full Monty\\", \\"Sleepless In Seattle\\" or \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" - \\"Shall We Dance\\" is a bit of a modern day gem. Ok it won't make the top 50 best films every made - but it will talcum powder its way into your heart and stay there. And on BLU RAY it's a winner.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />PS: Peter Chelsom has made other really great films worth checking out - \\"Hear My Song\\", \\"The Mighty\\", \\"Serendipity\\" and the wonderfully quirky \\"Funny Bones\\" which is set in his hometown of Blackpool in coastal Englanda modern day gem. Ok it won't make the top 50 best films every made - but it will talcum powder its way into your heart and stay there. And on BLU RAY it's a winner.    Recommended.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|UP delivers the kind of story-telling and animation excellence that we all expect from Pixar. Like all Pixar movies, there's plenty of laughs and entertainment for young and old. It's not strictly a kid's movie.<br /><br />What is unusual is 2 things:<br /><br />- first Pixar movie to use the RealD 3-D technology<br />- some non-traditional story elements that reflect the realities of modern life, rarely seen in mainstream children's animation<br /><br />First, the 3-D experience is fantastic! You get a pair of plastic glasses when you pay for the ticket. They cost more than a normal movie ($16.50 in NYC vs $12.50 normally). Unlike the flimsy paper glasses you're used to with red and blue lenses, these glasses are clear. They look like normal reading glasses and don't interfere with the colors onscreen, so you see clearly through them. And what you see is amazing! The effects really look real, instead of like flat cardboard cut-outs placed in front of one another. You can move your head around and the 3-D effect is maintained.<br /><br />The effects really have depth and some of the more spectacular shots are the flying ones, where you see buildings or canyons far below. You really have to experience this for yourself.<br /><br />Now for the story elements:<br /><br />-- WARNING! POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK ---<br />-- WARNING! POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK ---<br /><br />The film has two story elements that you might not expect from a Disney/Pixar film. First is Carl and Ellie's inability to have children. You see them grow old, then eventually, Carl becomes a widower. At this point in the film, I felt my eyes wetting up.<br /><br />Second is the little boy (Russell)'s non-traditional family situation. He has an absentee father (who is mentioned in the film, but never seen) and a guardian who is not his mother. Russell also has Asian features, perhaps the first Pixar film to have such a major character.<br /><br />Some people may consider these plot elements controversial. I didn't.<br /><br />-- END OF SPOILERS - SAFE TO READ BELOW --<br />-- END OF SPOILERS - SAFE TO READ BELOW --<br /><br />UP is a depiction of modern life, changing times, then a return to innocence. It deals with growing old, modernization, friendship, selflessness, and many themes that can be enjoyed by all audiences. Like all Pixar movies, it doesn't dumb you down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film if you can still catch it in theaters. Undoubtedly, the cheap paper glasses is what you'll get for the DVD/Blu-ray release of this movie (because of costs), so the theater is your only chance to experience the real 3D effects. Fun for the entire family.dn't.    -- END OF SPOILERS - SAFE TO READ BELOW --  -- END OF SPOILERS - SAFE TO READ BELOW --      UP is a depiction of modern life, changing times, then a return to innocence.

B0011IO45W|4.0|When I first saw this figurine in Target I was surprised at how low it was for the good quality. Schleich animals are nearly as good if not as good as Papo's or Safari LTD's figurines. This white tiger even has the stripes colored brown just like white tigers do in real life! Recommend this brand to anyone who is into animal replicas.
B00005QCVT|1.0|Do not buy an edited version of this film, the idea of this film being edited is ridiculous.  That said, there are a lot of reviewers claiming the film itself is ridiculous.  GO READ THE BOOK!!  Aronofsky does perhaps the most incredible job ever done by any director EVER in staying true to the story, it's mood and it's message.  Art can be deciphered in many ways and, personally, I've always felt that this story deals with far more than just drugs.  I find it sad that so many people here are trying to compare this film to Reefer Madness.  Really?  Is that the way to convince yourself that you're own drug habit isn't so bad?  Or do you simply live in a fairy land where all the junkies are fully functional and live well into old age because you're all just like William S. Burroughs.  Read the book before you start blasting the director and actors on this one.  Regardless of how you feel about the \\"glamorization\\" of drug-induced downward spirals, I think you'll agree that this film is captures the very essence of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is simply the finest album Judas Priest ever made. If you're sitting there wanting to hear the best that Metal has had to offer in the past 30 years then buy this album immediately. The title track will not only stomp on your toes, but rip your head off, spit down your neck, and throw your lifeless body 300 yards across the parking lot. Unbelievable. In the dictionary, where it has the entry for \\"Heavy metal\\", there is a picture of Painkiller. Quite simply a masterpiece.<br /><br />Nothing beats this for heavy...not Slayer, not Metallica, not numerous Death, Thrash, Black, Whatever metal. This is it...pure and simple. Sit through Painkiller on your ipod at full volume for its entirety and then tell me it's not the heaviest thing you've ever heard. Intricate melodies, screaming precision vocals, dueling guitars, thundering drums...it's all here. Rob Halford is simply magnificent on this album. Screaming, soaring, venegeful, malicious, evil vocals. Higher than the sky. Buy it. If you don't shake your hair, bang your head, or move your butt.....you're dead.
159562015X|5.0|Strengths Finder 2.0 is the follow up to Gallup's Now, Discover Your Strengths. The book includes a revamped version of the StrengthsFinder test that shows you not just what your top five strengths are, but also how you rank in the rest of the 34 strengths from Clifton's model. The new book is light on content (very light) but the test is a substantial improvement.     Here's how the book is set up:    StrengthsFinder: The Next Generation  (A short introduction explaining the need for the enhanced edition of the test based upon new thinking and research in strengths psychology)    I: Finding Your Strengths  (A 30-page overview of strengths psychology and how the Gallup system works)    II: Applying Your Strengths  (150 pages outlining each of the 34 themes including what people with that strength look like, how to manage them, and ideas for action if you have that strength).    The StrengthsFinder  (If you haven't taken it before, the code to take the test is provided in a packet inside the book. You actually have to buy the book to take the test)     [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]] is another book I really enjoyed that follows the SF 2.0 format. Obviously, that test measures emotional intelligence (EQ), but [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]] has a unique format where the test tells you which of the book's 66 strategies will increase your EQ the most.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I didn't think Daughtry could top his previous effort, having sold 10+ million albums or whatever it did, AND boast 5 or however many top 10 singles.  The songs on this album are higher quality, more complex, more mature, I'm REALLY impressed. Chris Daughtry's voice sounds better, even.<br /><br />Perhaps this review is a bit premature, since I've only listened to the album a couple of times, but I knew right off the bat, even on the first listen, that this album is something special.  Best Rock album of 2009, easily.
0440241901|5.0|I really liked this book. I started reading it and couldn't put it down! I finished it in one sitting by the pool! The main character is funny and it's easy to put your self in her shoes.<br />I found myself constantly laughing, and a part of me wishes the story could have gone on to a sequel, just so I could keep up with the characters.
B001E45XT4|4.0|My husband is the one that uses this gamin headset, so I picked his brain about them. He's very happy with them - hasn't had any trouble at all. I can attest to their noise-canceling quality firsthand because when he has them on he can never hear me talking to him. :) So, guess they work. LOL<br /><br />On a serious note, they have been great - the microphone works well and easily adjusted when he got them so that he's comfortable while playing at his computer. The earphone part of them them is big enough that he can sit and play quite a while without his ears hurting (which is the primary reason he got this new headset).<br /><br />The quality has been great and he's been very happy. Plantronics has shown to be a good brand for us over the years and this headset is no exception. Would definitely purchase Plantronics products again.
0765357151|5.0|I saw the movie with my friends and liked it a lot, but one them told me it had changed things (specifically the ending) quite a bit from the book.  But he wouldn't be specific.  \\"Read the book,\\" he said.  Well, I mumbled and grumbled, but finally I got the book. It has been totally worth it.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother doing a comparison between film and novel--it's best to appreciate them on their individual merits.  I will tell that I Am Legend was an intriguing reimagining of the vampire genre.  It looks to science not magic for an explanation for vampiric phenomena, while following an individual who is trying to survive a world that appears to be in its death throes.<br /><br />This book contains other short stories by Matheson.  I have not read all of them, but the ones I read were pretty good.  Clearly I Am Legend is his best work, but his others stuff isn't bad either.<br /><br />This certainly is a book I would recommend on its own merits, but would caution movie groupies to be prepared for the differences.

B000BBOV8U|5.0|This was a collection of all my favorite Brian Adams songs. They are perfectly placed to pop in your cd changer and listen to his career, some of his live concerts, and his best 80's hits. You can't go wrong, this collection is the best yet.

0307454541|4.0|I always seem to have trouble articulating whether I liked something immediately after finishing it. I'll admit I picked up The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo after hearing about the unfortunate circumstances surrounding its publication that seem to grow towards mythic proportions (on one hand Stieg Larsson wrote it to amuse himself passing the time, on the other He had actually submitted the three manusripts in the trilogy before suffering his fatal heart attack). What can't be denied is that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a slow burn thriller quietly plotted out with  political and societal subtexts to its story. It does also contain one of the more interesting characters in Lisbeth Salander, social misanthrope hacker whom people are interested in understanding even if doing so upsets their nature.<br />The main thrust of the story concerns disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist who's hired by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger to write a chronicle of his twisted family that includes ties to Nazism and a thirty five year old mystery. In truth the old man wants Blomkvist to find out what happened to his beloved niece who disappeared at a family event some time prior which is marked with the arrival every year of framed flowers to the old mans house.<br />I'll admit that the book is indeed very slow. Most of the first part of the book details Blomkvists problems after losing a case for libel in court and Salander having to deal with a perverted lawyer who's become her gaurdian in financial matters. The mystery doesn't really develop until further in the book as the twisted case of the Vanger family is related to Mikael from Henrik. Things do perk up when Blomkvist and Salander meet and become friends but I will admit that the mystery portion of the novel did seem built upon a revelation that only came about three hundred or so pages in and felt a little forced to drive the plot along.<br />Still though I did enjoy the novel and its quiet pacing. I liked the characters especially the twisted Vanger family themselves. And I liked Larsson worked social issues primarily on violence directed towards women throughout his plot while figuring heavily with the conclusion.<br />In the end its a great book with a fascinating mystery. I look forward to reading The Girl Who Played with Fire soon.the twisted Vanger family themselves.

006097625X|5.0|So much is communicated in every comic image that is entirely below most viewer's understanding.  This book is eye-opening!  A must for filmmakers, artists, even writers.  Your work will benefit from the insights provided by Scott Mccloud in this amazing book.
B000ICLRJ8|1.0|This movie is utterly devoid of facts and realism. This is reminiscent of the Arnold movies from the 80s & 90s, which wouldn't be so bad if this movie wasn't trying to be realistic and factual. I guess it should have been obvious from the Owen Wilson casting... this is someone thats good in comedies, not war (or action) movies. this movie i guess isn't too bad if you want a cheesy Hollywood action movie, but please do not expect anything else. this movie is unrealistic and factually retarded through and through.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent. Great casting, Giamatti & Linney especially. Plus learned some historical facts I was not aware of.
2266083082|1.0|As a warning, the French edition of Les Mis with the orange cover is not complete!  I found that it is only one of the three books needed to complete the story.  I wish this would have been stated in the listing's title or description.
B002866UOE|5.0|GREAT CD, WILL I AM AND FERGIE ROCK IT OUT, BEST CD THIS YEAR !
B000NA28A2|5.0|I've listened to rock music all my life.  From 50s to 60s stuff when I was a kid (in the 80s) to current music.  Now I am looking for different music to listen to in order to expand myself and also so I don't get so bored with music.    This CD was just what I was looking for.  I really like listening to every track.  Plus it is all upbeat which helps to get into a good mood.  Don't think I will ever grow tired of this and will always have it in my rotation.    I am hoping that his other CDs are as good as this one, though I highly recommend getting this album.
B00284BMBM|3.0|ONE - You Don't Belong - kinda generic sounding to be honest. But it strangely makes a decent opener. I guess I like it more than I thought. Heavier than some of the other songs.

B<br /><br />THREE - Every Time You Turn Around - has a strange, been-there-done-that feel to it but it's not too bad. sorta catchy.

0099503921|2.0|I really did not like the poems, and thought it might have been a different better book if this wasn't the case (and I actually like Victorian poetry, as I believe that's what the poems were modeling). It's hard to get involved in a book about a romance between two poets when you can't help thinking, is it me or is that poetry bad?  I didn't get past page 69, as skimming through the rest of the book gave me a general idea of what I thought was in store, and I just wasn't interested.  I give most books a chance but I thought this one was overrated.
B000002B35|5.0|I bought this CD & the DVD, I never got to see them Live so this is the next best thing!  It's amazing how many Awsome Memories these songs bring back of 1980's when I was in my Late teens & early 20's ( my playind hard, staying up all night with friends, rocking out to the music as loud as we could play it, Days) awww those were the days, now I'm in bed by 10pm, lol..However it sure is fun to listen to these songs and think about all the crazy times! This music is \\"Timeless\\" I enjoy it now in my mid 40's as I did in my younger days! So glad I purchased this!!!

B001EC9V58|3.0|Yeah, I don't actually know if the DVD is good because it won't play on my American DVD player.
B00297FEUS|1.0|Regarding the remastering, it's crap. You can barely hear the music on an otherwise classic album. I can't possibly understand how this was released to the public, error or not. What's laughable is that artists and labels actually expect people not to download ilegally, yet they release this, completely offending the few consumers who are still interested on spending their hard earned cash on CDs. I mean, I bought the album for the remastering job, not for the extra tracks, which are a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Update:<br />A month later and after some hassle, I received a replacement disc from Rhino Records, which sounds fine, and a letter from apology by Jay Jay French with a Twisted Sister button which is a very nice touch that shows the band really cares about their fans. The remastering job is nicely done, it wisely avoids pushing the overall volume upward by excessive compression like most remasters do nowadays, and the songs sound so clear that you can actually hear some editing cuts that weren't audible in the original CD. I still mantain my original one star review, since the product I received originally was defective, and at least in my book, people who buy a CD should always receive the best possible sound, otherwise, what's the point in not downloading?

0385340575|3.0|Lee Child's scores again with an exciting addition to his Jack Reacher series, Gone Tomorrow. Reacher is in New York and is on the Subway with a possible suicide bomber. The next thing he knows he's investigating her death and is caught up in a world of international intrigue. Child's latest is full of action-packed thrills. Reacher is as resourceful as ever and manages to cleverly get himself out of one bind after another. The only fault lays with the narative. Sometimes Reacher seems to ramble and the story slows down with to much detail. Overall, Gone Tomorrow is a fun and exciting Summer read. I'm looking foward to the nex installment and plan on reading the previous titles.   -BobsViews

Mike is a goofy worrisome monster voiced by Billy Crystal together they make this great movie/team that has you laughing and wanting to have a friend that is with you in everything you do. I love Boo the little girl she is so adorable she loves both of her new friends. This is a movie you can definitely watch as a family or just watch yourself you'll find yourself wanting to watch this movie again and again.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Ignore generic female crap like Blondie, Heart (Fart), Patti Smith, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, The Pretenders, PJ Harvey and Billie Holiday and listen to Beyonce's new album instead! It's great because it has awesome dance anthems, phat beatz, emotional ballads and \\"Single Ladies\\" has gotten a lot of BET airplay so you know it has to be good or else why would it be so popular? So throw out your crappy, dated 1961 Aretha Franlin albums and listen to the music saviour.. that is Beyonce.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Dracula was filmed in 1931 and really started the Universal tradition for great horror. I rate this grand old film at five stars and it is really the \\"gold standard\\" against which to rate all Dracula remakes. This film introduced me to the Dracula legend as a kid in the late 50's. The only thing I can think of that might have made this film a bit better is the beautifully composed and tailored music we all loved so much in later Universal horror movies. I feel to this day that the art work for Castle Dracula, and the approach to the castle via Borgo Pass were absolutely magnificent.<br /><br />Lugosi helped define the role of Dracula, and everything you may find endearing about him and his acting style I consider a vital part of that wonderful character. He honed and refined his Dracula characterization on stage in the many theatrical performances he delivered and then brought this iconic character to the big screen for Universal. By the way, the DVD was a wonderful transfer in glorious B&W.<br /><br />I am a great fan of Lugosi and remember him for much of his work for Universal and other fine film companies. Again, Lugosi defined Dracula for many of us!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I saw this movie 7 times in the theater.  I absolutely loved every second of it and will definitely be purchasing it when it comes out on DVD.  I highly recommend Star Trek to everyone. This movie exceeded all my expectations and more.  My favorite characters in the movie are Jim Kirk and Bones. Both of the actors who portrayed said characters did an amazing job and in my opinion made the movie even more amazing. All of the other people in the movie were also very good too.  I especially liked Scotty.  He is a hoot!  What are you waiting for?  Go and see the movie!!!
1582701709|5.0|If just must of the people had access to this book, I am sure life would be a lot more fun !!!! At first you are so scare of your own thoughts... trying to evade the \\"bad ones\\" with such intensity that you forget the good ones!! LOL... Thank God everything goes back to normal pretty soon.<br />This is a book to enjoy and a book to take seriously!
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This is a cute, family movie. Lindsay Lohan is adorable as the main character in this movie. It's nice to see her innocent. The adult actors in this movie are very good, too. It's just as well done, if not better, than the original. If you're looking for a light, funny movie, this is it.
1577314808|4.0|I picked this book up on a whim while roaming around Target. First off, you must know about me that I've never really been interested in philosphy, spirtual teachings, self-help books and the like. But I picked it up and was intrigued. I was going through some tough times in my life, and was caught in a mind-trap of compulsive, negative thinking, and I didn't know how to make it stop.   The book was hard for me to grasp and understand as, like I said, never read anything like it before in my life. But what I did was put into practice some of the suggestions of actually paying attention to your thoughts, and not labeling them, and truly feeling whatever you are feeling at the time. Do I live every moment like that? No, it's way harder than I had ever thought! But it made me realize how attached I was to my mind, and my thoughts, and I thought they were me, so than I worried that if I had a negative thought, that it was me. This book made me realize that I am something more than that.   I have to say, some of the book and concepts was harder for me to grasp as this a completely new topic for me. As I've done a bit more research, I've since realized that it isn't a new concept by any means. I think the author does a good job for those of us being introduced to this stuff...some of if was harder for me to grasp/understand, and I had to take some of it with a grain of salt.   What really resonated with me was just some of the concepts - learning that I can actually turn my mind off for awhile! (this is great for someone like me who has a hard time falling asleep because my mind is going, going, going...). Every time I told a dr. I had a tough time falling asleep, they threw pills at me. I knew there had to be a better way, so discovering this book + doing some self-hypnosis have been my tools.  The other thing that helped me was learning to deal with the pain that one might feel sometimes - I used to try and avoid it, but now I work on just accepting it, and feeling it and not trying to label it...wow, it works! I also felt like I was living my life either reliving the past, or worrying about the future--and realized how is that a way to live life?! Most of the stuff I worry about never happens, so why in the heck am I living my life like that? Why not just pay attention to what I have now and  be happy now? No new concepts, but just presented in a way that made sense to me.  Again, I think you have to take this book, read it slowly(re-read it even!) try out a few things and see what works for you. At the end of the day, you can't deny the present...it's insane(as he says!) I don't focus so much on the author or his motives, because honestly, the concepts he talks about work, so he can't be a total moron! And I know he might be just re-wording old concepts, but for the general public, he helped me to make sense of all of it.  As far as reaching true \\"enlightment,\\" not sure if I will ever get there..but I make a point everyday when I notice myslf drifting into my fantasy land of thoughts, to pull myself back to where I am now..and even that has made a difference in my life! I'm a little more calm(I can generally be a rather anxious worry-wart!), and for that, I am thankful!
B001E3AXGS|4.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is a skilled author and an artist with words. She takes you on a magical journey with a time-travel machine. In her book, \\"Team of Rivals\\", she took me back to the early 19th century in the rugged days of backwoods Illinois. I see young Abe Lincoln, having lost his mother and sister to tragic illnesses, develop a stoic, yet warm, personality. He wanted an education, but his father worked him mercilessly. When a friend loaned him a book, he was overwhelmed with joy. What a striking contrast to the bored, overindulged, youth of today. We see young Lincoln hone his political skills and wrest the presidential nomination from the frontrunner. We see President Lincoln thrust into a brutal civil war that he had hoped to avoid. Doris Kearns Goodwin paints the scenes and guides you through the story. Sometimes, she puts me not where I want to be, but where she wants me to be. I sometimes mentally protest, but she is the driver and she is a skillful one at that. I would travel with her again without a second thought.<br /><br />President Obama was influenced by this book and Lincoln's great abilities. He also filled his cabinet with his main rivals. Obama, like Lincoln, has extraordinary interpersonal skills and wisdom. Read this book and see the world as our new president sees it.<br /><br />Ralph Hermansen July 14. 2009
B002BCNK1Q|1.0|What a disappointment.  It was dull and predictable from beginning to end.  Four movie lovers watched this together, all fans of Clint's more recent work.  We were all sadly disappointed.  We can't figure out what others are seeing that we all missed.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|This was a Fathers Day gift from my 14 yr old son. We watched Gran Torino together and it got me thinking about Dirty Harry. So we looked the movies up and I could not believe my eyes when we found the Ultimate Collection.  Warner Brothers has done a brilliant job with the marketing and restoration of these classics. This is a can't miss!
B00192IV0O|5.0|Best disco guilty pleasure since Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\" This album not at all what I was expecting, but love it despite that. Like Madonna's release, some goofy & awkward lyrics, some far out stuff, but immensely listenable and can't stop moving when it is playing. One word description: Frenzied. In that regard, definitely has BEP's DNA firmly intact. All you who gave it 1 star: relax. BEP will do something completely different next time and surprise us all again.
0099456761|5.0|This was recommended to me by my 13 yr old niece and I admit that I was expecting just a simple pre-teen novel. Not so!! This is an excellent book that not only gives the reader insight into an misunderstood condition but is a cracking good story as well.    I highly recommend this to readers from 12yrs up. I would be an excellent book for a parent and young reader to read and discuss together.
B001HN697M|3.0|Usually by the time a franchise gets to prequel mode, it's a sign that it's growing a little long in the tooth (har har).  Underworld: Rise of the Lycans however just barely ends up being the best of the film series, in least in my eyes, considering I've never been too bowled over by the franchise to begin with.  The film details the beginnings of the war between the vampires and the Lycans, with brutal vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy) using the Lycans as slaves, including the special Lucian (Michael Sheen).  Viktor doesn't know of the ill-fated love affair between his daughter (Rhona Mitra) and Lucian however, and it doesn't take too much to see where everything leads.  Predictability aside, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans works well thanks to some rousing battle scenes, and mostly thanks to the performances of Sheen and Nighy, whose appearances in the Underworld films always managed to elevate them to being better than they should be.  Familiar faces are abound as the blood and limbs fly, and to close things up, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans is fun enough to warrant viewing, no matter what you may have thought of the previous two films.
B00004TLN3|2.0|from what i've seen so far, about 20 minutes....  think jane austen meets david lynch, or something equally as strange....  not a fan.
0307346617|3.0|decent, but jumps around between different phases of the Z war  more like a collection of short story fragments (scenes?) that the author categorized....   If this was the authors intent, then I don't like the format
B00297FEUI|5.0|Steve Jablonsky has done it again with a rousing score to accompany one of my favourite films of 2009!  All of the themes are back from the 1st film - Optimus, Bumblebee, etc.  Standout tracks for me are the last two on the disc - I Claim your Sun & I Rise, You Fall.  Fans of Linkin Park will also recognise the New Divide theme in the 3rd track - Nest.    All in all a definite 10 out of 10!
015206396X|2.0|I had high expectations for this book when I saw it often compared with The Hunger Games, which I absolutely loved.  I started reading it and was intrigued by the idea of \\"Graces\\", however from there the author and story does little to nothing for me.  The world is a conglomerate of the same old same old in Fantasy Setting. There is nothing new, nothing interesting, and not even the same old same old told in an interesting way.   The story is so awfully predictable. You can see everything coming too clearly. There are no surprises in this book. There is no intrigue. There is no writing that will dazzle you. It is a gamely effort though by a young first time author. She shows some potential here. And the basic premise of this book is interesting.       I give it 2 stars, which for me is almost awful, considering I am easy prey for Fantasy. I usually give points just for the genre alone.  It's very simplistic, and perhaps more suited for very young readers.   I was misled by comparisons to The Hunger Games, which is suitable and enjoyable for all readers. This will do next to nothing for the adult reader who adores Fantasy.
0743298039|4.0|I loved this story from the beginning and was sad (though satisfied) when it ended. It is a story within a story....with a twist! The author does a brilliant job of weaving it all together.    My only complaint is that the story lags a bit a points, especially around the time of Margaret's illness. Otherwise I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0025X4P24|2.0|Simply stated I love Vanessa Williams. I think she is a great singer, a superb actress and quite the beauty. I was so looking forward to this CD. I purchased it the day it came out....and boy was I disappointed. The CD is certainly not awful, but it is on the brink of boring.   No real songs stand out here and I have given this release several listens. I am so disappointed and bet you will be too.
630460291X|5.0|Terrific retelling of the famous Robin Hood legend, this time starring Academy Award winner Kevin Costner (Best Picture, \\"Dances With Wolves\\") as the legendary bandit of Sherwood Forest who stole from the rich to give to the poor and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian, the woman he loves. Rounding out the cast are Morgan Freeman as Azeem, Alan Rickman as the villainous Sherrif Of Nottingham, Shakespearean actress Geraldine McEwan as Mortianna, Michael Wincott as Guy Of Gisborne, Christian Slater as Will Scarlet and Brian Blessed as Lord Locksley. I grew up watching this excellent film, so I like it a little better than \\"The Adventures Of Robin Hood,\\" a classic in its own right. For some reason, actors using the right accents has bothered me in rcent years, but it's never bothered me with this movie. Though I enjoyed Alan Rickman as Nottingham (lines like \\"Shut up, you twit\\"...hilarious), I think Jeremy Irons would also have done a great job. Christian Slater was also great fun as Will Scarlet. Morgan Freeman was dignified as Robin's sidekick. The rest of the actors are very well cast in their roles. The movie should not have been rated PG-13. It should have been rated PG (the violence was mild). There's a surprise in the final scene of the film.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I watched this whole series in one day, I just couldn't wait until the next episode.  If you like Angel, Buffy, X-Files, this is a must to have!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|We love this CD/DVD set.  The concept behind it is wonderful and very inspiring.
B00275EGTC|4.0|We open with a promo for the benefits of Helium-3. In the future, it's been discovered that the sun's rays bathe our moon with this precious substance and can be harvested, shipped back to Earth, and used as a pollution-free power source by means of nuclear fusion. The only hitch, apparently, is that harvesting Helium-3 requires an astronaut to spend three years on the far side of the moon, where darkness and barren landscapes serve as reminders of just how isolated he will be. This is the situation Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) finds himself in. Even with a well-stocked food supply and various forms of entertainment, one can only be alone for so long before the mind begins to deteriorate. Is there any way to account for talking to yourself? Is there any way to account for a literal interpretation of that last statement?    There are such fascinating psychological concepts coursing through \\"Moon,\\" the feature film debut of Duncan Jones, son of musician David Bowie. He tells a story, but he seems much more interested in probing the human mind. This is interesting given the fact that, at this unspecified point in time, there's no real way to define what it means to be human. I'm being annoyingly vague, I know, but this isn't a film that easily lends itself to detailed descriptions. The audience will continuously be asking, \\"Why?\\" all throughout, which is good because Bell is asking himself the exact same question. Things are happening for reasons no one is entirely sure of, save for the fact that this entire operation is run by a corporation. Corporations have agendas. Agendas have to be kept.    The story unfolds gradually and doesn't actually begin until the moment Bell crashes his rover vehicle into an automated harvest machine. He awakens in the medical ward of the main station completely unaware of what happened. He is, however, continually reassured by the station's computer, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), who has a central unit running along a track on the ceiling.It obviously has no feelings, but it is programmed to know which emoticon to display at the appropriate moment. Does this computer know more than it lets on? Why was it able to have a live video conference when Bell could only rely on recorded messages sent back and forth? He could have had the chance to speak directly with his wife, Tess (Dominique McElligot). Then again, after three years, she's likely to be a very different person.    GERTY, whose monotone voice is eerily incompatible with its accommodating nature, will inevitably be compared to HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Indeed, there many distinct similarities throughout the whole film, from the sterile look of the station's rooms to the emphasis on science and technology. That being said, \\"Moon\\" doesn't end with a spiritually profound statement. It goes for a more existential approach, continuously exploring themes of sanity, isolation, physical health, and most importantly, self-discovery. I'd like to say more on that last point, but I think you'll enjoy this movie much more if you go into it cold, as I did. Not knowing beforehand what I would be experiencing allowed me to think about it all throughout on a deeper level.    Much of the story plays like a duel, in one corner a reasonably fit Bell, in the other a Bell whose body seems to be losing cohesion. He's feverish and pale. He continuously coughs up blood. He's weak and hostile. There isn't much of an explanation for this, but it does make for an interesting visual counterpoint, quite possibly made with the intention of representing different aspects of his personality. Other traits come into play, none more telling and understandable than his hobby of carving wood into miniature buildings, complete with miniature people. He also tends a small potted garden, and he makes a point of talking to the plants as he gently sprays them with water. Three years is an awfully long time on the moon. Even holding a conversation with GERTY can't possibly be enough to keep him going.    The mysterious nature of the story is second only the mysterious nature of the moon itself. We know that it's reachable, and indeed, we've been there before. But how much do we really know about it? What secrets lurk within the craters and deep shadows? In the future tense of \\"Moon,\\" corporate entities see it not as a celestial enigma but as a resource, and who's to say how long they can rely on it before it's depleted? How long can you rely on people as a resource? These questions are never posed in the film, but I sure did think about them as I was watching. \\"Moon\\" is a science fiction fable of the cerebral kind, one that refuses to bombard the audience with typical action-grade clichés like laser blasts and spaceship fights and alien invasions. It works not as a spectacle but as a thoughtful analysis. We all use technology, but have we ever stopped to consider the psychological ramifications?
B000059MEK|4.0|remembered hearing \\"one more time\\" on the radio and found several of the videos when going through old tapes -- bought and enjoyed the movie and just had to get the cd so i could playlist it for the car and for while 'net surfing    very good techno-pop that can drag you in if you give it a chance
B00004ZELJ|4.0|i bought this dvd cuz when i was a kid, i recorded this concert off the tv and watched it sooooo much! this dvd brought back a lot of memories from my childhood!  the picture quality is amazing, so no complaints there.  however, the sound quality isn't perfect. it definitely sounds like this was made in 1998 or so...[cuz, duh, it was] it just doesn't sound like surround sound or anything..and in one song [or i only noticed it in one] the sound kinda fades in and out a little.  i would give this product 5 stars if it weren't for the sound from that one song...  definitely worth the buy.

B00284BMBM|5.0|I absolutely love this album! This album is just as excellent as the first. There is no track that misses the beat. Daughtry sure has proven he knows how to pull the heartstrings of his fans and make his mark in music. He didn't win Idol, but he didn't have to! He has proven with two excellent albums that he is the definite idol in everyone's eyes! My favorite tracks are No Surprise, Every Time You Turn Around,Open Your Eyes, September, and Call Your Name. These are just my favorites of the album. It is really hard to pick the tracks, because they are all amazing! So go buy it Daughtry fans and those who want the best!!! Keep them coming Daughtry!! You are absolutely amazing!!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Simply put, it was a wonderful movie. Had a great plot. The car itself explained a number of references in the movie, however, that's not what it's about. It had enough twists to keep people really entertained, more of a serious movie about our current social/economic views.
0385341008|5.0|I purchased the book, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,<br />because of its title.  The book is as much fun as the title led me to believe.  It is filled with quirky characters and historic little known WWII facts. It describes a place and people I would love to visit.
1428122672|5.0|I must disagree with the previous review.  Mare Winningham did such a wonderful job I was amazed throughout. Her insight into the characters and delivery made me want to look up everything she has read.
0307277453|5.0|This was a required read for an evolutionary biology readings course.  This is the best book I have ever read for college and would not hesitate to recommend it to everyone.  Shubin is amazing, he writes so that everyone can understand, and it is applicable to life. It explains why creatures are the way they are, and it is interesting, exciting, and hard to put down. It would be a great introduction for people who are not scientific, and it is savory for the scientific minded.  After reading this book I was excited to do a research paper on some of Shubin's other scientific works.  I highly recommend this book.
031606792X|1.0|I read a comic strip once called \\"God-Man\\", in which God is portrayed as a superhero. He's omnipotent, of course, and in one issue a villain plots a way to destroy him... so God-Man simply makes the villain disappear with a single thought. The joke is that a narrative about an omnipotent character is ridiculous - there can't be any real challenges or problems, it's boring. And this summarizes my problems with the last book in the Twilight series, Breaking Dawn.    For three books Meyer has set up and maintained the same theme over and over again: \\"Love takes sacrifice\\". In order to be with Edward forever, Bella is going to have to suffer some very serious consequences. She's got to give up her humanity, first of all. She'll be a monster, perpetually hunted. Unstoppably hungry for decades. She can't see her family or friends any more because she'll kill them. In fact probably half of every book before Breaking Dawn is dedicated to scenes that reinforce this very theme - Rosalie drops in on Bella to point out that she's not going to be able to have children once she's a vampire, Jacob makes it abundantly clear that once she's a vampire he is out of her life for good, and Edward is always demonstrating the \\"normal human things\\" she'll miss out on once she's changed.    So the only logical premise for Breaking Dawn is this: Bella becomes a vampire, and then she has to live with her choice. It's the only way the story makes any sense, the only way to cap off a theme running 2000+ pages before it. And that's not how it happens. As it turns out, nothing changes for the worse once you're a vampire. All that setup, all those consequences, everything - it's all completely 100% negated by the book. The plot is just a series of events like this:    Cullens: \\"Remember that you can't see your dad any more because you'll kill him.\\"  (Bella's dad shows up and Bella doesn't kill him)  Cullens: \\"Wow Bella, looks like you'll get to see your dad after all.\\"    The end result didn't make me feel better for the characters. I didn't give a figurative \\"Thumbs Up!\\" and get warm fuzzy feelings about how everything was going to be A-OK for Bella and company. It just made me feel, over and over, that I had wasted my time.    Everything else about it that bothered me - all the totally bizarre, grotesque, stupid or nonsensical plot points - was just another layer over the unstable foundation of the novel. Some of it was downright laughable, like when the author herself intervened to answer Jacob's request for a vampire glossary by providing one with a footnote.    So there it was. Most characters reduced to hollow shells of their former selves, all themes cast aside, all narrative rules broken. I made it to the end of the series, and the end result was that this book was a huge huge let-down. Very disappointing. If you are thinking at all about reading these books - read the first and stop there. Everything goes downhill from that.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I love Pixar films. There are very few that I don't just flat out love. Last year's Wall-E was a homerun. Films like Monsters Inc., Toy Story, and Finding Nemo are just some of the examples that really make this company shine. In my humble opinion, UP belongs right there with the rest of them.  This is completely different than any of the previous Pixar films but it is still a great one. Granted, this movie probably won't be as enjoyable for the kiddies but I'm sick of people trashing this movie because \\"Pixar movies should make me happy all the way through.\\" People can't take that a cartoon can have some depth and, well, some realism. If you are looking for a slap-stick \\"Kung-Fu Panda\\" type movie then this one really isn't for you. It's sad, hilarious, and touching. The reviewers saying \\"He had a happy life, why is he sad?\\" Get back to me when you lose someone after a lifetime of being together. He watched his wife slip away while always putting off their mutual dream. People are trying to destroy his house, and he's lost the love of his life. I'd say he has the right to be upset. Anyways, I digress. If you give this movie an honest shake and watch it for yourself I think you will come to appreciate this movie.

B0029358GM|4.0|Wilco is a tough band to deal with. They take chances. They cannot be pigeonholed. They do not cowtow towards fans, critics or anybody else. And, unfortunately, they can be a victim of their own success. This is a good cd, with some terrific songs. The musicianship is spellbinding and the song writing top rate.<br /><br />I fell in love with this band on \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\". That cd is meant to be listened to,  from start to finish...like \\"Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". Their follow up, \\"A Ghost is Born\\", really in the same vein, was also a wonderfully adventerous work. The problem is that you cannot always create only masterpieces, it's an unrealistic expectation.<br /><br />Wilco (the album) is good, classic Wilco. It's a more quiet work, with virtuostic yet very subdued playing. Yet, there is still real good stuff on it with not a lame track, and some great tunes like \\"Bull Black Nova\\" (classic avante garde/experimental Wilco), \\"You Never Know\\", \\"Everlasting, everything\\" and \\"Sonny Feeling\\".<br /><br />\\"Sky Blue Sky\\" was thought to be a lesser work and now, in hindsight, \\"Impossible Germany\\", \\"Walken\\" and \\"What Light\\" rank way up there with their other great songs.<br /><br />Jeff Tweedy is past 40 and guitar ace Nels Cline (who is awesome and brings a lot to the band) is past 50. You will have to expect maturity with their work.<br /><br />With this being their seventh work and with every album having it's own distinct personality, what other band has had this type of consistency?
B002HEOLFW|5.0|I loved the first album from Chris Daughtry, but it really did feel a bit slick and over-produced. That comes from using studio musicians that aren't a \\"band,\\" per se.<br /><br />No such business on this record. It's DAUGHTRY, the BAND, and it shows. The music feels looser and more live, yet still tight and driving. This is a very, very good second album. The songs remind you of the first album, yet they sound different enough that you won't confuse the two.<br /><br />This Deluxe Edition has two extra songs. What Have We Become is an excellent song, I loved it. On The Inside is just okay, but still worth the extra buck. It's being advertised that the iTunes version has 15 songs, but it doesn't. The 15th item is the No Surprise video. So this Deluxe Edition here at Amazon.com has all the actual songs you'll find anywhere else.<br /><br />The reviewers that went track by track on the standard version of the album got it right, I think, so I won't bother to repeat what they said. Go look it up there. :) But I wanted to add on about the Deluxe version that I think the extra songs are good, and worth spending a couple extra dollars to get.<br /><br />If you liked the first DAUGHTRY, you will like this one also. If you loved the first DAUGHTRY album, then start downloading this one NOW because you will love it, too!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I did my first day of Level 1 of the Shred this morning and it was A LOT harder than I was expecting. I've been doing Tao-Bo and Results Fitness: Boost Metabolism but Shred is harder than both and its only 20 minutes! Jillian does mostly old-school moves like jumping jacks, crunches and push ups. I have extremely weak wrists from carpel tunnel syndrome so push ups and plank poses are very hard for me. I prefer more modern approaches to cardio and strength training, but this DVD forced me to get back to basics (not sure if I like that or not yet). One thing that really annoyed me is Jillian barely does any of the exercises (maybe jumps in for the last 5, but thats it) and I prefer when the instructor does everything and talks less... (ie. Billy Blanks in Tae Bo and Tracey Staehle in Results Fitness: Boost Metabolism) I thought it was kind of a cop-out. Jillian's voice annoys me a bit too but thankfully theres an option to just have music (I'll be utilizing that once I know the work-out better) haha! I WILL be doing this work-out again but no way will I be doing it for 30 days straight. I plan to inter mingle it with my current work-out regime though. For the cost, its totally worth it. If you want a challenge and to seriously push yourself, Shred is a great start but if you're looking for a *fun* work-out that combines cardio and strength, I highly recommend [[ASIN:B001F12ITE Results Fitness: Boost Your Metabolism]].
0847830942|5.0|This book opened up another world for me. The photography is amazing.  I do wish that there was more text, but what is there is fine. More biography of the builders would have been nice...regardless this book is a treasure.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We so enjoyed this immensely.  The series sets up the entire baseline for the movie \\"Serenity\\", and includes the original cast.  The futuristic sci-fi series has well-developed characters, and has a witty humor that is very entertaining.  Although I had a slight problem with the wild west \\"cowboy\\" accent, (there is an attempt to explain this) I feel it would have faired well enough without it.  I think that had FOX not aired the series out of sequence, and allowed a fan base to be established, this series would have been very successful.  There still is a following for Firefly including a line of merchandise.  I think I join those who hope that it will resurface and let the story continue.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I happened across this movie on my watch instantly account with netflix and loved it.. Then came across all these rave reviews for a show that spawned this movie called \\"firefly\\"... I bought the complete series of firefly and now this movie.. I really enjoy both of these... Really really good... I'm only sad now that I watched all of them and there is no new adventure to watch.
0743270754|5.0|Lincoln's life is well known, general observations about his Cabinet are usually short and focus on the conflicts. Doris Kerns Goodwin's book gives new, detailed insite on how Lincoln managed the conflicts to suit his objectives. This book is a particularly good read for any manager of any large group of people.

B001U0HBPQ|3.0|With comparisons to to the far superior \\"Forrest Gump\\" aplenty, David Fincher's VERY loosely based adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story manages to stand, though wobbly, on its own. From a technical aspect, \\"Benjamin\\" is flawless, a masterpiece of technical wizardry and attention to detail. Yet, from the standpoint of a story, it's sadly lacking any kind of emotion, which is surprising and ironic because the actors certainly convey enough emotion. It's just that these emotions never fully involve the viewer like it did in \\"Forrest Gump.\\" We're not really sure if we even knew who Benjamin Button really was, even though we spend nearly 3 hours with him. This also goes for the character of Daisy. As a result, we're not fully convinced or even that involved with the story, which is a shame because it's a very interesting set-up: a man is born old and continues to age backwards. It's a brilliant and commendable premise that I applaud director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth (who also penned \\"Gump\\") for attempting to tackle such an odd non-Hollywood story involving themes of mortality. Unfortunately, the end result isn't as beautiful as the picture itself presents to be.     Though this is a failed masterpiece, it is definitely worth seeing. When something this strange comes out of Hollywood and everyone's paying attention (mainly because of the lead actors), it time to rejoice that film is still able to be creative.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Wow! This CD is better than the first, and the first one was pretty impressive. IThere is not a bad song on this CD. Awesome job!
B0023P1D8S|5.0|This two CD version of Master Of Reality is a must have for Black Sabbath fans mainly for the second disc, which contains previously unreleased versions of all but one song from M.O.R. and the rarest of creatures, a previously unreleased song, yes, a bona-fide song!! As far as I know, this is the first official release on CD of any previously unreleased Black Sabbath song. The name of the song is 'Weevil Woman 71', supposedly (at least that's what they say in the liner notes) in reference to 'Evil Woman', which it also kind of borrows the riff from. I agree with what they say in the liner notes...it's a shame the Black Sabbath didn't work on this song more and try to include it on one of their albums, for even in this slightly unfinished and rough state, it is a killer of a song!! The main riff is very heavy and I like the way the tempo picks up in places. I think this tune would have sounded more at home on Volume 4 than on Master Of Reality. It is not the greatest song Black Sabbath have ever done, but hey, it's 'previously unreleased', man, and is definitely going to be played on the my next radio show on the 25th of July.<br /><br />Also on the second disc, we are treated to instrumental studio outtakes of After Forever, Solitude, Orchid and Children Of The Grave, along with alternate lyric versions of Sweet Leaf, Into The Void and Children Of The Grave and an alternate mix of Lord Of This World. Aside from Weevil Woman 71,the version of Lord Of This World is the most interesting thing here, as it has Ozzy's vocal double tracked and most importantly, piano and...in a few places...SLIDE GUITAR! While I can see why they ultimately didn't include this mix on the original album, in some ways I actually prefer it! As for the alternate lyrical versions, I am happy that these lyrics didn't eventually get used and am even more grateful for the lyrics that Geezer would later write for them. Still, it is very cool and interesting to hear.<br /><br />As for the original album, it is actually my least favorite of the first three Black Sabbath albums, though I still absolutely love it and consider a classic album and easily give it five stars. After Forever is in my top ten of favorite Black Sabbath songs. I have always loved Solitude, which showed off a more mellow and laid back side of the group. Production-wise, it is the heaviest and loudest Black Sabbath album ever, with Iommi getting his best guitar sound. A classic album. This two CD version is another reason to buy it again.lly my least favorite of the first three Black Sabbath albums, though I still absolutely love it and consider a classic album and easily give it five stars.

0312370849|5.0|The storyline is developed in a manner that I have noticed more lately and enjoy - shifting time frames and different charactors that come together.    In this case Sarah is a young girl whose family is taken away during the Holocaust and Julia is an American writer who is assigned to write about an infamous event in 1942 where thousands of Jews were rounded up, in France, for transport.    The chapters move quickly back and forth between Sarah and Julia's stories, though later it becomes more of Julia's story and perspective. To me the book was better in the sections with Sarah overall, so there is some drop off to me when Julia is more in focus, perhaps because of the more direct historical backdrop of Sarah's story.  Some of Julia's personal issues also were not overly interesting (or perhaps once again not quite the same as Sarah's sections.)    Don't get me wrong, even some of the sections that did not appeal to me quite as much were still very good, and overally the book is one that I would read again.
B000002KMY|5.0|Reading some great reviews and input here.  I prefer this album to Heaven and Hell, but it is close.   I like them both personally.   Regardless, I recommend Mob Rules if you are into Ronnie James Dio and his solo work.  Infact this album probably surpasses most of his solo recordings and is signature Dio as well as Sabbath.    Overall, there is not a weak song on this album aside from the instrumental filler as mentioned.   Almost all of the tracks are highlights!
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing \\"Mario Takes a Walk\\" on Sirius radio several times. I found this cd which seems to be a compilation of some of his previous CD's. Althought I had never heard of Jesse Cook before purchasing this cd, the musical samples sounded interesting. I have really enjoyed this cd which is a radical change from what I normally listen to in music.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|The only FireWire port in my computer is an 800 so I thought that I would have to buy a Firewire400 card to plug into my motherboard in order to be able to use a FW400 external drive that I have. Then I discovered the Sonnet adapter. No extra FireWire card needed, and no hassle. I just plugged the Sonnet adapter my existing FW800 port and then plugged my harddrive's FW400 cable into the Sonnet unit. No settings, no software to install. I just plugged it in, and it worked! :)
B0000042H4|2.0|This recording of Wagner's Ring cycle was revolutionary.  It was made possible by John Culshaw's vision, and Solti's single-mindedness, and the new technology of LPs and stereo sound (on Decca).  Although well-intentioned, the end product was artifice, devoid of dramatic impact, despite its sonic wonders.  Disjointed patches of the quilt.       If you are looking for a set of the entire Ring cycle with dramatic thrust, from beginning to end, a monumental task indeed, I would recommend a live performance, and none better than Karl Boehm's recording from the 1967 Bayreuther Festspielen, made two years after Solti's effort, with many of the same principals (on Philips).     Solti's Ring is the best seller in classical music sales ever (ca. 18 million), topping the Three Tenors (ca. 14 million), according to Norman Lebrecht, in The Life and Death of Classical Music (Anchor Books, 2007, 136).  Nevertheless, if it is the drama of this complex, somewhat absurd, tale you are searching for, and the musical and vocal commitments needed to carry it through, then Boehm's interpretation is the one you will want.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I have watched this movie several times just because I like it so much. It is very well cast and very well done, not to mention the story itself is a true story set in an interesting time (early 1900's). The special effects are great.

B00005K9LN|5.0|Metal Gods Judas Priest released its sixth studio album British Steel in May of 1980.<br />The album was a change for the band in several ways. First, the band (which consisted of lead singer Rob Halford, lead guitarists Glenn Tipton and KK Downing and bass player Ian Hill) got a new drummer out of ex-Trapeze drummer Dave Holland (who would be their second long serving drummer (only his successor Scott Travis has been with them for 19 years)). Second, the band recruited producer Tom Allom (beginning a decade long association with the band after being an engineer for Black Sabbath in the early 1970s and also produced Def Leppard's superb debut album). Third, the band released their first album of the decade they would reign supreme, the 1980s. Recorded at Titenhurst Park (the estate of Beatle Ringo Starr (previously owned by his deceased bandmate John Lennon)), they created a masterpiece which is still one of the best albums ever made (as I found out when I bought the original US cassette edition in 1997 (I was familiar with three tracks on the disc \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"Metal Gods\\" and \\"Living After Midnight\\" as they were on the 2-CD best of Metal Works)).<br />The original US album opened with \\"Breaking the Law\\" which is one of the band's best loved tracks and a great song still to this day. Next is the track \\"Rapid Fire\\" (which opened the UK issue of the album and opens the remastered CD (the US version switched tracks around)) which is a fast, prototype speed-metal kick*ss rocker. Great lyrics and superb guitar dueling by Tipton and Downing. Next is the great rocker (which became the band's nickname by fans and rock journalists) \\"Metal Gods\\". Halford's superb singing and sci-fi lyrics coupled with Downing and Halford's riffing makes this a killer rocker. We then have \\"Grinder\\" which is another rocker with raunchy, in a good way, lyrics, and another staple of the band's. The first half ends with the track \\"United\\". Like \\"Take on the World\\" (on 1979's Hell Bent For Leather), this is an uplifting, singalong anthem and is also one of the greatest rock/metal anthems ever written.<br />\\"Living After Midnight\\" (which kicked off Side Two of original US/Canadian release) is next and was one of Priest's first US rock radio hits and became a staple of American rock radio. This track may have been seen as sellout city but its hook, riffs and lyrics make this song rock. Next is \\"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\\" (which was the first track on Side Two of the UK release of the album) and is an underrated, great track. Next is \\"The Rage\\" which starts with a cool bass guitar riff from Hill before turning into an epic rocker with some uneartly Downing guitar solos. We close the album with the fast heavy rocker \\"Steeler\\". It has more classic guitar work, singing and lyrics. A kick*ss way to close the album.<br />British Steel became Judas Priest's first US Top 40 charting album and first Gold seller (would hit Platinum after the success of 1982's Screaming For Vengeance) for good reason. The songs, production, playing and the resurrection of hard rock and metal at the time made this a timeless album.<br />The remastered CD version of the album features the tracks in its UK sequence (\\"Rapid Fire\\", \\"Metal Gods\\", \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"Grinder\\", \\"United\\", \\"You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise\\", \\"Living After Midnight\\", \\"The Rage\\" and \\"Steeler\\") plus an outtake from the scrapped double Twin Turbos album (which became Turbo in 1986) entitled \\"Red White and Blue\\" which was a great power ballad. It's ironic that Judas Priest, (a British metal band), wrote a song about what is also construed as an anthem for American pride. There's also a live version of \\"Grinder\\" from 1984's Defenders Of the Faith Tour.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!, this is an uplifting, singalong anthem and is also one of the greatest rock/metal anthems ever written.  \\"Living After Midnight\\" (which kicked off Side Two of original US/Canadian release) is next and was one of Priest's first US rock radio hits and became a staple of American rock radio.

0307454541|4.0|I loved this book!  I couldn't put it down the whole week and a half it took me to read it.<br /><br />I only have a few complaints about the book.  I thought the beginning was a little slow and the murders are quite gruesome!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong this was an excellent book!  I would suggest it to anyone who wants a page turner!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I had a little trouble with delivery but i contacted the seller and fix everything. Even sent me an extra work out video. The video itself is great if you still with it.. u will see the results. I have to do it off and on cause sometimes life is just busy. But it is totally worth it. I could tell something was different even after a week. And I an very active!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I love this show. There is nothing else like it currently on tv that I know of. Each episode continues to be creative in plot, special effects, and the message it delivers. I also dont think its fair to give a low star rating on Amazon for the actual show, just because you dont see it avaible on blu-ray! That has nothing to do with the actual show and the actors and shouldnt be a reflection on the quality of the art!
0930289234|4.0|This is the first time I've read anything even resembling a comic book, and I really liked it. I decided to read it because my dad, who is pretty picky with what he reads, read this book and loved it, so I decided to give it a try, and I'm very happy I did.<br /><br />Don't go into this expecting it to be a light reading, cheesy super hero comic. This is a very serious novel of staggering depth, with lots of psychological elements and well defined characters. A surprisingly deep read.<br /><br />My only real complaint about this novel is that some of the attempts at humor are a little dry. For example, in the first chapter, someone says something to Rorschach along the lines of \\"You have friends now? I guess you changed your deodorant.\\" luckily there are only a few little things like that. All that aside, it's a great, unpredictable read. Highly recommended, even if you've never read a graphic novel.
B000SEIDR0|3.0|The number of very positive reviews of this book aroused my interest. Then I heard Pollan on a radio interview and was further intrigued. He is the current king of food understanding and misconsumption here in the USA and abroad.<br /><br />His basic advice, which I find memorable and sound is:<br /><br />\\"Eat real food. No too much. Mostly plants.\\"<br /><br />His analysis of how corn feeds all the meat we eat (chickens, beef, pork, and fish) to how it influences a great many prepared foods through the pervasive use of corn syrup or corn starch was wonderful if overwrought.<br /><br />I looked forward to his analysis, but what I found was much different. With a witty and balanced journalistic style, he takes the reader on a wide variety of short trips to organic farms, abbatoirs, and food processing plants. The stories are well told, but after the first 100 pages, I bored of yet another story that made a point that had already been firmly established and embellished.<br /><br />His personal agenda started getting in the way of his keenly developed overview of how we have brought so many industrial methods to food processing, that much of what we now eat is barely worthy of being called food.<br /><br />But he does soundly make the case that we couch potatoes eat cows that are forced to live like coach potatoes.<br /><br />Overall the book's style was great, but the long-winded and repetitive nature got to me after awhile.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I've seen this movie over 100 times, seriously!  There are very few movies that have what this movie has - it's just great!  The cast has an amazing chemistry; they are all so talented.  The music is perfect.  Perfect original scoring & soundtrack selections that you could just lose yourself in!  The Holiday continues to make me smile every time I see it!  Check it out, if you don't like it - sad...  =8')
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is easy to learn, and fun and challenging to play.  The game can be played in around an hour, and it is designed so that no one can run away with the lead.  It is always a close game and there are a variety of strategies to inch ahead.  My husband is a Dungeons and Dragons type of gamer and I prefer scrabble or Pictionary (or other party games), but we have found some common ground with this game.
B00003CXB4|5.0|For those who dislike \\"The Morning Report\\",you can choose between \\"Special Edition\\" and \\"Original Edition\\" on the DVD.    This movie is still as good as it's ever been. A classic rendition of Hamlet.
B00278U1W0|4.0|I have watched numerous Eric Clapton DVD performance products and have never been dissapointed in a single one. This disc is no exception. The music selection and quality is very good and the interplay between the two classic rock Hall of Famers is electric at times. However, this band although very good is not at the level of EC's previous stage bands. Also even though the video quality was high (almost perfect) on Blu-ray, the camera shots and angle selections are often questionable. Very little is shown of the audience...I know we pay to see the performers but when the crowd is feeling it and really gets into the music some of those shots add to the video experience. Best tracks are definately the blues selections like Double Trouble and Pearly Queen. The Jimi Hendrix tune Little Wing (Layla album) is worth the price of the disc.  Overall I give it a B+. Music A, Sound quality B+, tune selection B, video B+ and camera views C.  If your an EC or Winwood die hard you will not be dissapointed. Younger folks that have an interest in the music of the late 60's & early 70's will learn much from this performance.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Daughtry is sure to please all previous Daughtry fans, and reach new fans, with their second effort.  This album features Chris Daughtry's awesomely powerful vocals, and the bands melodious rock to make one catchy, sure to be chart topping, success! There is something for all Daughtry fans on this cd.  Hard rockers to acoustic ballads, and everything in between.  Even a country tune! Somehow Daughtry is able to make it all flow smoothly, and is a very cohesive album!  One of my favorites is the last single \\"Call Your Name\\"--a super smash monster ballad written by Chris and drummer Joey Barnes!
B0025X4P24|4.0|Jazzy and upbeat. Some songs you want to listen to with a glass of wine while others, you want to get up and dance. Nice combination of music and vocals. I cannot stand when the music is overpowering the singer. Vanessa seems to have gone back to what made her successful as a vocalist in the beginning.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 56 years old and in good shape, can easily swim a mile and lift weights, but still, I'm 56 :) - this is the very first exercise DVD I've *ever* done and it has opened up a whole new world for me!  Love how I feel that my butt has been kicked and I have sweat just pouring off of me by the end - however, I think at my age it would be a mistake to do this workout every day, so I've settled on three times a week - also, I hate to disagree with Jillian, but I *cannot* do jumping jacks!  I tried and I could tell I was about to do serious damage to my knees!  I think most of her advice is geared toward 20- and 30- somethings who probably *can* do jumping jacks, but I have to stick up for those of us over 50 - I do running in place as fast as I can, and that *is* something I can do! I don't agree at all with people who think Jillian is \\"annoying\\" - I think she really cares, knows exactly when to encourage you to stick it out on a move, and I have tremendous respect for her!  I've now ordered more of her exercise DVDs - You go, Jillian!

Disappear- Now I love this song more than \\"Halo\\". I am soooo mad that she doesn't sing it in the tour. I am also really mad that it's not a single. It deserves to be one!!!!    Broken-Hearted Girl- I like this one a lot. She sings sooo fast. I'm a good singer, and I couldn't even catch up with the speed of it.    Ave Maria- This song is good. Nothing else to say...

B000009ROK|5.0|A super romantic set of three discs from the incomparable Luis Miguel-Best voice in Spanish music, perhaps the best voice in music period. No one delivers a romantic ballad like Luis. Even for those somewhat versed in Spanish language like myself, you will find yourself drifting off to romantic times/places and will soon be singing along with Luis- like the lover you are, whether you understand what he is saying or not..It's really about the delivery and no one delivers/emotes like Luis.  My only regret is that there are no liners which are available to buy in English so you would know what he is really singing about. No matter, it's still amazing music delivered by the most amazing voice.
B00284BMBM|4.0|I couldn't wait for this cd to come out, as I am a huge fan of Daughtry's debut cd, as well as a fan of Chris from \\"American Idol.\\"     My initial reaction to this cd was mixed. I was not blown away by the cd as a whole the first time I listened to it. I replayed the cd about an hour after the first run through and felt myself warming up to it. I did like, \\"No Surprise,\\" and \\"Life After You,\\" the first time I heard them. They are the most popish songs on this cd. And what I find interesting is that both songs were co-written by Chad Kreoger of Nickleback, and for me anyway, they happened to be the most memorable.     \\"You Don't Belong\\" written by Chris himself is a good rock song, with an edgier sound than the two I mentioned previously.     The songs, \\"Ghost of Me,\\" \\"Learn My Lesson,\\" \\"What I Meant to Say,\\" and \\"Supernatural\\" are also edgier and have more of a rock sound.     What really surprised me on this cd however, is the country twang. The song \\"Tennessee Line,\\" which I do like is almost a country song. The only thing remotely close to a country sound on Daughtry's first cd is the song, \\"Home,\\" and that really wouldn't cut it as a country song. Likewise, I think that the songs, \\"September,\\" and \\"Call Your Name,\\" have country twists to them.  \\"Call Your Name,\\" does not end with a country sound. That one picks up a rock sound in the middle and it carries it through until the end of the song. That is my favorite song on the cd at the moment. That switch in sounds works for me. I think it helps the song build momentum and allows the listener to feel the words and the emotion of the song. And as I continue to listen to this cd, I really do like these country sounding songs. I have found that the chorus of \\"Tennessee Line\\" is stuck in my head. But they threw me at first, as I was not expecting that type of sound.      I don't have strong feelings one way or another about \\"Open Up Your Eyes.\\" The lyrics are heavy and emotional, but I don't feel the rhythm. The songnever grabs me. It isn't a bad song, but it is not one that stands out.     The song \\"Every Time You Turn Around,\\" doesn't do anything for me. As it never actually seems to pick up a rhythm.     I will say that the band did not stick with any one type of sound, as the first cd seemed to have had. The listener can definitely tell that the band took risks and changed things up, which is always a good thing. As for the few songs I didn't care for, well you can't please everybody all the time.     Overall, it is a good cd. I am glad I bought it and I will listen to it for a long time to come.
0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larson here has achieved something unique and special. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a book to be cherished by mystery/thriller lovers for its ability to break out of the ordinary linear plot structure most other writers adhere to.<br /><br />NOTE: if you have not read hundreds and hundreds of mysteries, this might not be the book for you. I think it takes someone who has spent a great deal of time wallowing in the genre to fully appreciate the subtle approach Larson takes here. This is not your James Patterson thriller or easy to digest Grisham legal drama. It takes a little work to get through the pages. In the end though, once you've made it through, the reward is great.<br /><br />Basically, Larson weaves together a very complicated mystery of a girl who vanished decades ago along with a story that deals with international business in a highly original manner. The characters are flawed and brilliant. The bad guys are not out of the ordinary, so the story is not so black and white. The writing (though translated, so I am unsure exactly how great it is) is first class.<br /><br />Dont pass this one up. Great great read.

B001IBIQU6|4.0|Depeche Mode heads into their 20's by going back to the future. Revisiting the spacey synths topped by crunchy guitar distortion that made them superstars with [[ASIN:B000002LK1 Violator]] and [[ASIN:B000002MJC Songs of Faith and Devotion]], \\"Sounds of The Universe\\" goes back to a moment and tries hard to recapture it. On occasion, they pull it off.<br /><br />\\"In Chains\\" is a great starter, going back to the oppressive goth imagery that has been a DM trademark. In a relationship based on imbalance, singer David Gahan laments that he is all too aware what it's like \\"to live in chains.\\" The nonsense lyric that is \\"Wrong\\" is just abrasive enough to magnify its hook (think \\"Personal Jesus\\"), and \\"Little Soul\\" fights for its rightful place in a world gone bleak. \\"I'm channelling the universe and it is focusing itself inside of me,\\" the band earnestly states.<br /><br />On occasion, the band is recycling itself a bit too much, like on \\"In Sympathy,\\" which could have been a [[ASIN:B000002KN8 Speak & Spell]] leftover. In fact, the longer \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" goes on, the more you realize you've heard this all before. While the best stuff (\\"In Chains,\\" \\"Fragile Tension,\\" \\"Wrong\\") pull this album above average - hence the 4 stars - this is a pretty good Depeche Mode album overall. Better than [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 Playing the Angel]] but light years behind [[ASIN:B000002LCI Music for the Masses]]. As a fan, I am OK with that.

0385341008|4.0|I have been looking for a book in which to lose myself for months and I have finally found it!  \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a rare and wonderful book! Don't let the title throw you off.<br /><br />Set in post WWII on a little known Island, Guernsey, we discover what it was like to live under German Occupation during the horrific times of WWII.  The writing is charming and each character so vividly developed that you lose yourself among them.  I found a part of me yearning to be accepted into their charming, idyllic society. I wanted them to adopt me as their friend.<br /><br />Unique to this delightful book is the way in which the story is told; through, a series of letters written by our main character, Julia Ashton.<br />Julia is a journalist-turned novelist on a book tour as the story opens, searching despertately for a topic for her next book.  We meet her publisher, Sidney, her best friend, Sydney's sister, Sophie, her wealthy American suitor, Mark Reynolds and the cast of characters among the Island of Guernsey, where her curiosity discovers a life she could never imagine.<br /><br />You will fall in love with all of them, but the Isle of Guernsey's heroine is Katherine, whose intelligence, strength of character, courage and bravery is the \\"glue\\" that keeps the \\"Society\\" alive.<br /><br />The heart of this book is a love story, which always includes an element of tragedy.  Combine this with laugh-out-loud craziness and vivid characters rich in their uniqueness and a tale told in a style so uncommon, actual letter writing for heavens sake! (I found myself checking the dates of each letter to see how long the postal system took to deliver them).<br /><br />All of this works together to create a book that delights the senses. I want to read it again!

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt / B001PA0FFO<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I have my doubts (har-har) that I went into \\"Doubt\\" with the correct mindset. I had expected one of those \\"mess with your head\\" movies where the viewer is never quite certain who was telling the truth and who was lying (or just blatantly wrong). So I was rather surprised and a bit disappointed when Philip Seymour Hoffman pretty much shows up in the first scene wearing an \\"Hello, I am a pedophile\\" T-shirt.<br /><br />Not that this was a bad call on the part of the movie-makers. Hoffman's recent roles have been enough of the \\"shifty, guilty, and terribly wrong\\" variety ([[ASIN:B00112S8RS Before the Devil Knows You're Dead]]) that it would be difficult for movie-goers to jump past that particular little type-casting long enough to give Hoffman the benefit of the doubt, particularly after a couple of decades of seemingly endless priest scandals and an unforgettable viewing of [[ASIN:B000NIVJH2 Deliver Us from Evil]]. So even though a token effort is made to make Streep seem unfairly mean and spiritually shriveled, and to make Hoffman seem like a \\"jus' folks\\" kind of guy whose love for kids is completely wholesome, it's always clear that this token effort is made to excuse the doubts of the ancillary characters only, never to seriously engender doubts in the viewer.<br /><br />Not that the ancillary characters need much coaxing to believe the worst of Streep and the best of Hoffman. Adams stars across Streep as her younger foil, and her character is simultaneously frustratingly naive and yet realistically plagued with doubt. Her animosity towards Streep stems largely from an ideological difference in teaching (Adams thinks children are all unique butterflies and Streep thinks children are all unruly ruffians), but even when she makes this animosity plain and clear, Streep merely absorbs the abuse without a blink and carries on as if nothing has happened. By contrast, Hoffman reacts violently and abusively (even going so far as to incorporate the incident into an abusive and twisted sermon on \\"his version\\" of the matter) towards the slightest hint that his behavior may have been inappropriate, and Adams fails to notice anything usual or vindictive about this behavior in her haste to exonerate the priest.<br /><br />And here is the crux of the matter: Adams doesn't want Hoffman to be exonerated because she likes him, so much as she NEEDS him to be exonerated so that something awful hasn't happened under her very nose. Streep, on the other hand, is convinced of the truth and will not turn away from her convictions, but she confesses, in the movie's climax, to being haunted by doubts. The question we are left with is: What does she doubt? I do not think she doubts Hoffman's guilt or her own rightness, but rather I believe she doubts either the benevolence/existence of god or the rightness of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to, or possibly both.<br /><br />I deeply enjoyed this movie, if not as a \\"who's telling the truth\\" thriller, then at least as a dramatic depiction of one woman taking on the world, if not to save a child then at least to purge her school of a predator. As a treatise on faith and doubts, it yields no answers, but does provide many thought-provoking questions.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollent into an abusive and twisted sermon on \\"his version\\" of the matter) towards the slightest hint that his behavior may have been inappropriate, and Adams fails to notice anything usual or vindictive about this behavior in her haste to exonerate the priest.

No story at all. Save your money and if you really must see this movie, rent it. Don't waste you money. For that matter, don't waste two hours of your life watching it either.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|Growing up I was a HUGE MJ fan, in fact his songs were the soundtrack to many of the best times I ever had as a teenager and I think I can safely say that I'm not alone when I say that. It's no exaggeration to say that MJ enriched so many peoples lives and his music means something to EVERYONE, whether they were a true fan or not. I must be honest here and admit that I hadn't listened to his music for quite a few years prior to his tragic death.<br /><br />When he passed, (rest in peace Michael, maybe now you will finally be left alone) I just had this gut feeling that I had to go out and buy an MJ album to honor him, as corny as that sounds. Sure I could have downloaded any MJ tracks I wanted from the net and made my own compilation CD but I wanted the real thing. I kind of felt like I would be betraying MJ's legacy if I didn't go out and hand over the cash for the real deal so I went out and bought MJ \\"Ones\\".<br /><br />This is just a great CD, you can find the track listings elsewhere so I won't waste your time re-listing them here in this review but all the big, 'essential' ones from Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad & Dangerous are there. There are couple of songs I would have liked to have seen make it onto this CD but the most important ones are all there. Listening to awesome, classic MJ hits like 'I just can't stop loving you' and 'Black or White' literally brought a tear to my eye.<br /><br />In life, certain people from various disciplines come along that you just know you will never see the likes of again: Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Roger Federer etc etc. Michael Jackson was one of those people as far as musical, dancing and sheer entertainment ability is concerned and I feel privileged to have been able to enjoy his music and showmanship in my lifetime. Do you think we will still be listening to Justin Timberlake or Brittany Spears twenty years from now? I don't.<br /><br />Long live the King of Pop! RIP MJ, you will be missed.

B0000AUHPK|2.0|Overview:<br />Film is heavy on narration, with a female narrator. The narrator allows a large amount of action to be told rather than experienced. Additionally, the film is rather cheesy. Furthermore, this adaptation emphasizes the love story between Catherine and Heathcliff.<br /><br />I recommend the 1998 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation. Below, I have listed some points of comparison/contrast to show why I think the 1998 is better.<br /><br />1.<br />Nelly's character is much better developed in 1998 adaptation. In fact, minor characters are overall better developed in 1998 adaptation.<br /><br />2.<br />Heathcliff appears more sincerely distraught in 1998 adaptation. He appears more insane in 1992 adaptation.<br /><br />3.<br />Class and historical, time-sensitive issues are covered better in 1998 adaptation than 1992 adaptation (ex: Catherine's desire to marry Edgar for money. Heathcliff's desire to have Catherine II marry Linton so he could obtain Thrushcross Grange).<br /><br />4.<br />1998 adaptation shows the story better by visual sequences rather than just a narrator's voice. In other words, the 1998 adaptation is more interesting than the 1992 adaptation.<br /><br />5.<br />1992 adaptation does keep two points that the 1998 adaptation does not. (1) It keeps the beautiful/stormy weather scene, and (2) The scene where Catherine tells Heathcliff that if he kisses her again, she will die.<br /><br />6.<br />1992 adaptation is 16:9 aspect ratio. The 1998 adaptation is 4:3 ratio. Therefore, the 1992 adaptation has the better picture quality for most wide-screen televisions.

B000LPQ6DE|3.0|Note:<br />I have now seen ALL the color adaptations of Jane Eyre. While I liked this adaptation better than the 1981 and 1996 adaptations - and about equally well as the 1997 A&E adaption - I thought the film fell short of the 1973 or 1983 BBC adaptations.<br /><br />My primary problem with this film is that it seems to modernize the story. In other words, the language and mannerisms of the actors appear more 21st century than 19th century. Now, there are many examples of this. I will list a few.<br /><br />1.<br />2006 adaptation has Rochester hire someone to play a fortune-telling gypsy. I believe the reasoning behind this is that it would appear more logical to a 21st century audience that is very critical of the supernatural. (i.e. 21st century viewer might say, how could Blanche NOT know the gypsy woman is Rochester!!) However, in the early 1800s, I think a man like Rochester could have pulled off dressing like a gypsy because of the religious superstition of that period.<br /><br />2.<br />Blanche is kinder is this adaptation than the 1973 or 1983. I guess the 21st century young people would be amazed at the rudeness Blanche conveyed in the earlier adaptations. Therefore, the scriptwriters softened her image.<br /><br />3.<br />In 1973,Michael Jayston presents a somewhat vulcan Rochester. Both the 1983 and 2006 adaptation make Rochester appear pretty. However, the 1983 DOES create a vulcan Rochester AFTER the fire at Thornfield. Therefore, in a way, they made up for his handsomeness before the accident. However, the 2006 just makes Rochester too handsome for the whole film.<br /><br />4.<br />In Oliver Twist, the classic lines \\"Please, sir, I want some more\\" and \\"It's more no than yes Bill\\" are remembered. I could not imagine any credible adaptation revising these expressions to \\"I would like to eat some more gruel\\" or \\"I do not want to go to court to see if Oliver is there.\\" Likewise, this adaptation changes many of the classic and memorable phrases from the novel. For example, Rochester calls Jane \\"a witch\\" rather than \\"an elf,\\" swears by using God instead of deuce (devil).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />Jane Eyre (1973) and (1983) are much more loyal to the original story-line. Because of this, it is possible that Masterpiece Theatre decided to change the story a little to appeal to viewers who wanted a change. I do not criticize the adaption nearly so much as I do the Oliver Twist (2007) BBC adaptation. However, I just personally feel that for me the 1973 and 1983 are better, more loyal productions. Since I am a literalist, I think they are more worth my time and/or money.\\" rather than \\"an elf,\\" swears by using God instead of deuce (devil).

B00192IV0O|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm not a diehard Peas fan. I jumped on the bandwagon after hearing Monkey Business and seeing them perform on BBC<br />America. I LOVE them....That they can pursue individual projects and start families (Fergie) and  put together another FINE effort like this is<br />AMAZING!<br />  Some have criticized the vocalizations on the CD. I enjoyed the pounding my car speakers put out when I first played the CD....I don't get that kind of SOUND from most of my CD's. For me, I love most of the songs.<br />I do think this CD is more commercial then I'd like as in \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", but that's OK, the other songs on the discs more than make up for it.

B001TOD92C|5.0|This movie is one of the strongest products that I have reviewed for this site. It is absolutely splendid. Never to be forgotten.    The acting was powerful. Mickey Rourke put everything he had into this role, much like his character, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, put his all into his wrestling. The direction was flawless. This movie sets a standard for which all filmmakers should strive.     It seems to me that this film captures the American Dream: If you are tough enough you can succeed. By this I mean both Rourke and \\"The Ram.\\"
B001FBSMF8|1.0|This album is not rock, not pop, not country, not rap, not jazz, but more like bad techno with words.  This is hard to listen to.  Yes I am an Audioslave fan, been a long time listener of Soundgarden, and have Chris's other solo albums which are decent, but hardly compare to his work the two aforementioned bands, but this is rediculous.  Just terrible music with no real meaning, no feeling, no true instrumental value, and it just plain sucks.

B0018YIFEK|5.0|Consider a situation that happens all too frequently: an only child is diagnosed with a terminal illness -- in this case, leukemia.  She could be saved by the transfusion of stem cells from a suitable donor.  But neither her mother nor her father are compatible.  So the parents decide to have a second child, and use the new baby's umbilical cord blood for the transplant.  And it works!  But it only works for a while.    Now what?  The younger sister is proven to be a compatible donor.  Do you use her again?  This time, they won't harvesting umbilical cord blood that would otherwise be thrown away.  This time, they'll be forcing a painful operation on a rather young girl.  Do they or don't they?  They do.  And it works again.  But again, only for a while.    Eventually, the older sister goes into kidney failure.  She's too ill to live long by dialysis.  Now what?  Harvest the younger girl's kidney?    And that's where this novel begins!  For while the mother is assuming that Little Sister will of course donate an organ to Big Sister, Little Sister files suit for medical emancipation from her parents.  The subsequent struggle tears up the family, makes the characters and the reader ponder some serious moral and ethical issues, and tells a cracking good story full of interesting, finely-realized characters.  The obsessive mother, fiercely determined to save her eldest daughter's life, the father who can't relate to her any more, the son who feels ignored, and most importantly, the sisters with divergent interests, best friends who love each other intensely.    This book has recently been turned into a fair movie, but there wasn't nearly enough time to get all the riches of the novel onto the screen.  I liked the flick, but I loved the book.    After reading this, I intend to read all of Picoult's books.  If one other equals this novel, I'll be well rewarded.  Novels don't get better than this.

0671015206|1.0|This has got to be the most monotonous book I've read in years, and that's saying a lot for somebody with a bunch of science and math textbooks on his bookshelf.    I'm guessing the authors first draft was something like 2 pages long, and the publisher told him to bulk it up to a couple hundred pages so people will feel like they're getting something substantial for their $10.    I'm here to save you the $10, and I'm sure the author would be proud that you're saving money already.  Ok, are you ready? Most often, millionaires become millionaires because they are frugal. Tada!    There will be 200 pages of that statement reiterated over and over again in the book if you're interested.
B001U0HBQ0|1.0|Why is this film dull? Could it be that the characters are empty, and that they passively coast through the story, meekly awaiting their fate? The fact that Ben Button is growing younger might be expected to twist his psychology in an interesting way: unfortunately we are given no insight into this psychology. He takes the first manual job that comes along, a business is bequeathed to him, and his imagination is limited to pursuing his childhood sweetheart - all this challenges him to the most minimal degree, and he is asked to make virtually no interesting decisions. Yes, he is growing younger, but this seems to make almost no impact upon him, nor upon those around him. The character appears to be a very unreflective and retiring person; what's more, Brad Pitt delivers a performance that is curious in being bereft of emotion - was he afraid of ruining his elaborate make-up? Kate Blanchett's character has a bit more spunk, but her restlessness is extinguished mid-film, and she too is reduced to a pretty well silent witness to proceedings from then on. There is virtually no internal, nor much external, conflict between the protagonists, nor between them and the world.     All this amounts to an idea in search of a story. Imagine if you were asked to watch a monkey being born old, then slowly growing younger as time went on, until finally petering out. As a three minute video on Youtube this would be (kind of) interesting. If it went on for three hours, I don't think many viewers would last the distance. Without a story, the novelty wears thin - as is the case here.

Along with Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, this movie brings home in a way rarely seen how much of an impact we are having on the Earth, and what we must do to change the dire outcomes which are already happening around the world. This movie will captivate you, awe you, and inspire you to start making the changes in your own life. The breathtaking panoramas are unlike anything outside of an IMAX film, and are absolutely incredible.
0786856297|5.0|My seven year old son (who is a strong reader) is now on the fourth book of this series has has enjoyed them all very much.  There is good action and adventure without being too scary, and he frequently laughs out loud at the humor.  The books have also whetted his appetite for the Greek gods, so we have a couple other books on them for further reading.  The vocabulary is challenging for him, but it hasn't slowed him down. I'd say this series would be perfect for kids in the 7-12 year range, depending on reading ability.

B00003CXC7|3.0|I am a serious collector and when I read these reviews about this special edition \\"Newly Restored\\" Hitchcock masterpiece I had to have it. Sadly If you mean just tweeking the colors to call it fully restored then it's ok. But this restoration missed the dust and dirt particles that appear through-out this whole movie. White, black dirt all over this thing. Although the attempt was made it should be clarified that this falls very short of a true restoration. Yes the colors are rich and vibrant but one can't help notice the dirt all over it. So just to make it clear it might have been restored but not to the standards given to other restored movies. This edition really needs to be cleaned up. Hence the 3 stars instead of 5... as a truly restored movie would get.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Note: Obviously, this is only a review of the show, not the DVDs themselves, and readily spoils material from earlier seasons.<br /><br />Nowadays the trend in television is to peak early and stay on the air too long. Thus far, Supernatural has avoided these pitfalls, and has steadily improved from the show's entertaining, but hardly remarkable first season, which focused on conventional monsters, urban legends and horror film homages. Season 2 proved to be a substantial leap, where the show expanded and detailed the demonic underpinnings of the narrative, and with season 4 we see another increase in quality. While Supernatural always had individually entertaining episodes, it was only after Dean's (Jensen Ackles) Faustian bargain concluding season 2 that the central story arc came into focus. Now the mythology grows more impressive, with Dean mysteriously retrieved from hell by a disturbingly impassive, stoic angel Castiel (Misha Collins), and called to assist in the struggle against Lilith. Some are surely skeptical about the introduction of angels, as they aren't the coolest supernatural figures around, but Kripke and the host (haha) of writers provide an atypically powerful, unnerving portrayal. While wussy, friendly angels are common in modern popular culture, Supernatural draws upon a more biblical and Miltonian view of angels as fierce warriors and messengers. Moreover, the angels aren't precisely friends to humanity, but simply oppose the demonic hordes as well and will use the Winchesters as necessary to combat them. Misha Collins's Castiel, the most prominent angelic figure, is the most effective addition to the show. Collins's performance is brilliantly minimalistic, with his ragged look and deliberate movements perfectly suggesting a lack of familiarity with his body. Even better, Collins slowly inserts a subtle sense of humanity into the role as Castiel grows more conflicted about his duties, and finally creates truly intriguing character to go along with the Winchesters.<br /><br />Simultaneously, Supernatural complicates the central relationship between Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean. While at the show's beginning it was the loyal Dean that dragged a rebellious Sam back into the \\"family business,\\" the roles are now substantially shifted: Dean has, unsurprisingly, been scarred and left somewhat hesitant by his months in hell, while Sam has learned to work by himself, even expanding his demonic powers which he had sworn to forsake. (And yes, the shifty but supposedly pro-human demon Ruby has returned, though now portrayed by the less attractive Genevieve Cortese.) Using a fraternal relationship as the heart of the show proves to be the series most impressive element. While, ahem, manly bonding is hardly unheard of in pop culture, the relationship between two brothers, particularly those of similar ages, are still unique, and too often ignored in our romance-obsessed world. Dean has always been the more likable of the two, as Sam is usually too whiny, but Sam has slowly gained more depth as the show progressed. While Padalecki and Ackles both initially struck me as somewhat vapid hunks, they've both proven to be effective leads and both provide some of their best work this season. Indeed, after this season Ackles's cocky and jokey but also committed and loyal Dean has cemented his position as one of my favorite TV characters.<br /><br />With all the developments in the central story, the conventional monster-of-the-week and comedy episodes are still atypically strong. Previously the humorous episodes tended to be weaker, but now we have some first rate examples in the requisite B&W horror tribute \\"Monster Movie\\" and the oft-hilarious malevolent wishing well episode \\"Wishful Thinking.\\" They also find some new twists on the monster angle, including the disgusting cannibalistic manbeast the Rougarou in \\"Metamorphosis,\\" the murderous Siren (yes, like in Greek mythology . . . kinda) in \\"Sex and Violence\\" and a classic bit of magician-oriented horror in \\"Criss Angel is a . . .\\" Kripke and company also don't hesistate to take the show in bizarre directions, as in the \\"Back to the Future\\" style \\"In the Beginning,\\" where Dean meets his youthful parents and \\"It's a Terrible Life,\\" where Sam and Dean have inexplicably lost their pasts and identities, and instead work in a seemingly generic office. The season has no real throwaway episodes, always maintains the level of stylish eeriness that defined the show, and manages to step up the gruesomeness and intensity a bit from time to time. (\\"Family Remains\\" and the vicious ghoul epic \\"Jump the Shark\\" are both particularly nasty.)<br /><br />The final few episodes concerning the central story are perhaps not as strong as I would've hoped considering how compelling the season had been previously, but the conclusion still leaves me with great expectations for season 5. I fear that it may well try and be to big, if you understand my point, but the rock solid nature of this season give me reason to hope that they can pull it off. If they can maintain this level of quality for another season and if 5 is indeed the end, Supernatural will likely vie for the title of the best supernatural/horror TV show ever.<br /><br />All in all, this is a terrific season from what is, with the end of The Shield, my favorite show currently on the air. Anyone with an interest in horror-oriented television needs to check this out, from the beginning.iented horror in \\"Criss Angel is a . . .\\" Kripke and company also don't hesistate to take the show in bizarre directions, as in the \\"Back to the Future\\" style \\"In the Beginning,\\" where Dean meets his youthful parents and \\"It's a Terrible Life,\\" where Sam and Dean have inexplicably lost their pasts and identities, and instead work in a seemingly generic office. The season has no real throwaway episodes, always maintains the level of stylish eeriness that defined the show, and manages to step up the gruesomeness and intensity a bit from time to time. (\\"Family Remains\\" and the vicious ghoul epic \\"Jump the Shark\\" are both particularly nasty.)    The final few episodes concerning the central story are perhaps not as strong as I would've hoped considering how compelling the season had been previously, but the conclusion still leaves me with great expectations for season 5. I fear that it may well try and be to big, if you understand my point, but the rock solid nature of this season give me reason to hope that they can pull it off. If they can maintain this level of quality for another season and if 5 is indeed the end, Supernatural will likely vie for the title of the best supernatural/horror TV show ever.     All in all, this is a terrific season from what is, with the end of The Shield, my favorite show currently on the air.

0316113077|3.0|This book rates highly as food porn - the photography & styling are amazing, but when you get down to the business end of things (making cakes) you thud to earth quite quickly.    Even assuming most people wanting to use this book would be fairly experienced bakers, there's a lack of detailed instructions & photos of techniques used.I found this very frustrating. Expect to have a good knowledge of basic assembling & decorating before you start making any of the designs.    Also, a lot of the designs went over the edge from fun to outright kitsch. I suppose its an attempt to appeal to everybody, but it dilutes the effect.    On the positive side, the cake recipes themselves are very good. I made the chocolate & the red velvet cakes, & both were superb.    Overall, a disappointment, & a fairly expensive one.
B0012GMX1K|5.0|\\"THREE FRIENDS\\", is the name of the new band, by the way. That's right Kerry Minnear, Gary Green, and Malcolm Mortimore,(all key members of Gentle Giant), just this year- have formed a new band! Having just started, they're doing older \\"Giant\\" stuff, but if you're a G.G. fan, I'd strongly suggest you write their website, and try to encourage them to do a new album. Just for starters, if you've heard any of Kerry Minnear's recent music for the two live DVD (menus), you'll know what I mean! I never would have guessed! Perhaps some of the other former members, (who thought that something like this never would have taken place), might consider entering the fold now!      Anyway, being a musician myself, I used to play with an excellent keyboardist/composer by the name of Gerald O'Brien who has since made a name for himself writing and co-writing hits, as well as producing. We once had a progressive, complex band that did mostly original material, but one of the few originals we did was \\"A Cry for Everyone\\" (off this album), which was the most challenging, (and also one of the most fun), songs I've ever played! We probably gave up on, or didn't even consider doing \\"Knots\\".       Finally, this is a superb CD, \\"Raconteur Troubadour\\" being my personal favorite with a uniqueness all it's own that makes it virtually \\"timeless\\".
6305907145|1.0|Mansfield Park is my least favorite of Jane Austen's novels (by this I mean I've only read it twice).  So when I read the reviews stating that this movie was not true to the book, I didn't give it much thought, thinking that the movie would be good in its own right.  Well, I've just finished watching it, and I wish I had my money back.  It is unlike Jane Austen altogether with weird implications regarding Mr. Bertram's conduct in Antigua.  All the other one-star reviews are accurate, but here's a little more in case you're still not convinced: (Spoiler Alert) Mary Crawford actually stands up amidst the entire family and states (out loud) her wishes that Tom die so that Edmund can inherit the estate.  Fanny is strong willed throughout the movie (obviously unlike the book) but then she flip-flips on the only important decision she has to make through the entire course of the movie.  By the end of the movie, I felt that the Crawfords were the lucky ones to have escaped from Edmund and Fanny.
B0012GMX2Y|5.0|THAT'S RIGHT! Kerry Minnear, Gary Green and Malcolm Mortimore (all,from Gentle Giant), have just formed a new band this year, and they're called, \\"Three Friends!\\" Who would have thought?! I heard a bit of them doing \\"Free Hand\\", and it sounded flawless, with a new singer sounding perhaps something like the guy from Kansas. But what's really exciting, (along with them getting together in the first place), is the prospect of them perhaps doing a new album! Hearing Minnear's recent theme music for the two live DVDs, makes that a very appealing prospect, indeed! I think we'd all better start e-mailing them about that, if you want to hear something akin to a new \\"Gentle Giant!\\" And, hell, who knows, perhaps other former members may feel encouraged to enter the fold. Cross your fingers!      Oh yea, this CD... It's one of my favorites- ominous, pretty, medieval, complex and it rocks too, when it needs to. Stands out apart from all the rest.

0316044695|5.0|As the title suggests, Luttrell was the lone survivor of a four-man SEAL team that was on a mission in Afghanistan.  When the team radioed for help, 16 more SEALs and special forces soldiers responded and were killed when their helicopter was shot down with an RPG.  That is neither the start nor the end of Luttrell's story.    Luttrell begins his book by providing some of his background and then a description of his SEAL training.  These are important as an aid in understanding just how someone could survive what he did, both physically and mentally.  He then describes the mission of his team, their fateful decision, and their heroism as they fought for their lives.  Luttrell, severely wounded but not quite defenseless, then places his life in the hands of Afghan herders who defy the Taliban and rescue him.    This is an unbelievable tale of dedication, heroism, humility, and faith.      Some reviewers don't like the fact that Luttrell makes some comments about \\"liberal media.\\"  Fine, but there is no denying that concerns about how the liberal media would react play an important role in the story.  For good or bad, this shows that our military personnel are not unaffected by how they are portrayed in the media here at home.
B000001ELF|4.0|First of all, let me preface why I gave this four stars instead of five.  The only reason is that I don't give perfect ratings easily.  Plus the rating is my own subjective opinion anyway, obviously.  Your mileage may vary.  But this is a great album.  Paul is obviously a more talented singer but Ace's album is better overall.  (No offense, Paul - you still rock! :)  I'm not going to try to break this down track by track, others have done that already.  But if you're a KISS fan at all you should have this album, and Paul's too.

B002ECE8A0|2.0|The book is great, and the Kindle price is very low ($1.99 as I write this). However, the Kindle file is riddled with errors: typos, bad returns, sentences run together, no table of contents. There's nothing like reading a great book and having the experience marred by a terrible translation to a new medium. I would have happily paid more for a decent, readable version of the book.
B001NB1OSC|5.0|I got this album after hearing the samples and praise from anyone I asked about it.  I must admit, at first I was severely disappointed.  I found that I only liked a few of these songs.  Now this is unquestionably my favorite U2 record and one of my favorite albums alongside Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and Muse's \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\".      This was referred to as \\"the sound of men chopping down the Joshua Tree.\\"  I hear why.  This CD is nothing like its predecessors.  U2 has taken there musical style to new and inventive heights with this.  Each of these songs are memorable.  One is beautiful, Zoo Station, Even Better Than The Real Thing, and The Fly make great use of distortion, as well as being very catchy.    Overall this album deserves the praise being heaped upon it.  If you you're looking at this album you have great taste in music, for this is a musical classic as much as \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is a literary classic.

0307266303|4.0|This is a book about two interesting cultural worlds: that of ultra-runners, and that of the Tarahumara peoples in rural Mexico.  Both groups are fascinating.  Ultra-runners can do marathons as warm-up runs for 100 mile marches through climates beyond my imagination.  The Tarahumara for their dynamic culture, part of which revolves around their own distinct versions of ultrarunning.  The book tells those stories through a mix of one narrative line building towards the \\"greatest race the world has never seen\\" and an interspersed series of tangents about running and the human body.  The storytelling here has an infectious, boyish enthusiasm that takes great advantage of the cultures at hand.       This is not, however, a book of sophisticated cultural analysis.  It is loaded with hyperbole and reverence--everyone we meet is described as 'the greatest' is some way, and every situation is presented as either supreme ecstasy or the most dire agony.  The Tarahumara, for example, are described as a perfect society that has figured out all dimensions of \\"body, mind, and spirit.\\"  But that grand claim is both unsupported and oversimplified--the descriptions ring of the type of \\"noble savage\\" categories that deny the complexities of all human cultures.  Likewise, traveling to the canyons of northern Mexico is described as a process of constantly taunting death--conveniently ignoring the fact that thousands of people live and thrive in those communities every day.  But ultimately these exaggerations did not distract me as much as they might because they read as part of the author's genuine enthusiasm for his subjects rather than simply being naive oversimplification.  The book is written as a charming story, and its exaggerations may be part of the charm.  I actually particularly enjoyed the stories about the crazy Americans--the 'party kids' who can drink and carouse all night and run all day, or the drifter who goes off the grid to live with the tarahumara and do little butrun as a type of meditation.    So while it doesn't seem wise to take the details of this book too seriously, I did finish it wondering if enthusiasm mixed with a bit of optimistic science really does conquer all in regard to pushing the human body--which seems to be the under-lying theme here.  The book tries to demystify ultra-running, but I still don't get it--I still don't believe that the 36 year old friend of a friend who's body is shot from years of ultra-running could fix herself up for a 100 mile trail run if she just ate natural and found her joy.  But that doesn't mean that joy doesn't matter at all.  I do take away an appreciation for the wonders of the human body, and some inspiration to have running be one way I might use my own body well.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I just watched the movie for the first time about a week ago and liked the music.  I sampled all the songs first right here on Amazon and liked what I heard.  I love every single song (some more than others).  There are a few more mellow songs at the end, but I like them.  It's rare to buy a CD and like every song on it (especially a soundtrack), but I am hooked on this soundtrack.  I can't imagine anyone who finds Supermassive Black Hole, Decode, Full Moon, or Spotlight boring (there was one reviewer who mentioned the soundtrack was boring; must have been on downers or something).  Those songs are my absolute favorites.  Next comes Eyes on Fire, Leave Out All The Rest, and Go All The Way.  The rest I enjoy, but not quite as much as those mentioned.  Whether or not you have seen the movie or liked the movie, this soundtrack is great.  On a related note, the original score for the movie is fantastic too.

1575666286|3.0|The Gerson therapy is said to be effective and its basic premise makes sense: detoxify the body and provide it with nutrients. The former with coffee enemas, the latter with \\"voluminous amounts\\" of fresh juices. But it costs more than $5,000 per week, and insurance might not cover it. Of course, some of these things you can do for yourself, at home, once you understand the program. But the full program involves a lot of work, which conflicts with the patient's need for rest. Does healing really need to be this rigorous? \\"Saturating\\" the body with nutrients might be counterproductive. Nutrient intake needs to be adjusted to the digestive capacities of the patient.<br /><br />Some of its dietary recommendations are questionable: a diet \\"overcooked by most standards.\\" While forbidding nuts, sprouts, and avocados, the program allows oatmeal and baked potatoes, despite cancer-causing acrylimides in cooked starches. It recommends Lugol's solution, which contains potassium iodide; the Natural Hygiene school considers this form of iodine to be toxic. The Gerson therapy is 100% salt-free, to its credit, but this means that iodine deficiency can be an issue. In my opinion, it is safer to get your iodine from a natural source such as seaweed than from Lugol's solution.<br /><br />Is cancer a disease of excess or of deficiency? Is it caused by too much of something or too little of something? The Gerson program assumes both to be true. It aims to detoxify and replenish at the same time. But can this be done? Can the body effectively detoxify itself while it is being \\"saturated\\" with nutrients? Fasting is nature's way to detox, very different from the Gerson way. A clean-up mode is called for in the beginning, not \\"voluminous\\" intake of anything. The nutrient therapy can come later, during the rebuilding phase, after the body has been prepared and thoroughly detoxified.<br /><br />The Gerson program makes more sense than most, but is inaccessible to most people.

B001FB55H6|5.0|This film was extremely well made and extremely faithful to the graphic novel. I've seen it two times and both times, it didn't feel that long. Apparently a lot of people thought it was though. A lot of people found it boring or stupid... well they're wrong. That's my honest opinion.    This film has a ending that will make you think and I guess people just didn't want to watch a movie that made you think. Well, whatever screw them, what do they know? They were probably the ones who wanted a 3 hour action film. Well that's not what this is. There are a few action scenes, but that's it. Just a few.    And yes, there is a lot of CGI in this film, but that doesn't take away from what its really about; the characters. It's over 3 hours long but as I said, it didn't feel that long to me. You be the judge, I thought it was great.

( Blaze sucked anyway) I don't expect them to ever make another album like Number of The Beast or Powerslave but this comes pretty damn close. The guitars are heavy and Bruce Dickinson proves that he is in the top 3 voices ever to come out of England for metal.(Dio and Ozzy of course need consideraton) This band is one of the greatest ever and will live on for ever. They stay true to their fans and their music. As a long time follower, that is the mark of a true metal band. Up The Irons Boys !!!!!
0061854549|4.0|This is really an excellent presentation, well-written and containing some excellent food for thought. It actually may be laying out the basis for a paradigm shift that redefines a lot of things in our world. The implications of Dr. Ariely's research are profound and even shocking. Yes, very intelligent and logical persons can be counted on to behave in predictably irrational ways, and this impacts lives and society very deeply, in ways which may be very bad indeed.<br /><br />Alas, I was a bit put off by some of the follow-up to his experiments. Dr. Ariely repeatedly drew conclusions from the irrational behaviors exhibited by his subjects, speculating about how people might be educated about this disturbing tendency toward irrationality and perhaps curb it. But time after time, he stopped his experiments short of testing whether or not such foreknowledge would work. For example, he gives groups a simple test and rewards the subjects with $.50 for each correct answer. Those who turn in their papers get an average of 3/20 correct. The self-reporters, on the honor system to report their scores, claim an average of 5.5/20. Why stop the experiment there? The next group should be told the average scores of prior groups and then be allowed to self-report to see if they got it and behaved with more honesty. This was not done - or if it was, the results were not considered appropriate for our viewing. A similar extension could have been made in most of Dr. Ariely's tests, potentially providing insights into the the value of awareness in ameliorating the predictably irrational or dishonest behavior. He speculated freely about this, but brought no research to bear.<br /><br />Secondly, I found it disturbing that the author would say such things as \\"Standard economics assumes that we are rational - that we know all the pertinent information about our decisions...\\" (pg  239). He says many similar things in the \\"The Fallacy of Supply and Demand\\". For one thing, he has conflated the definitions of capitalism and economics. For another, the capitalistic principles of supply and demand state clearly that imperfect knowledge results in imperfect decisions - it definitely does NOT assume that we \\"know all the pertinent information\\". Still, Dr. Ariely has demonstrated that this applies more broadly than we realized. It is not merely perfect knowledge of the markets themselves that is needed (which is NEVER present in any event); it is also knowledge of ourselves and the many ways that we are unconsciously susceptible to outside influences.<br /><br />To me, the extent to which I am reacting to something, when I thought that I was responding, is the jaw-dropper of this book, and worth the price many times over. I hope to see further work by the author containing followup tests of our ability to free ourselves from this trap via awareness.<br /><br />I rate Predictably Irrational a \\"Strong Buy\\".of capitalism and economics.

0316017922|5.0|The main tenet of Outliers is that there is a logic behind why some people become successful, and it has more to do with legacy and opportunity than high IQ. In his latest book, New Yorker contributor Gladwell casts his inquisitive eye on those who have risen meteorically to the top of their fields, analyzing developmental patterns and searching for a common thread. The author asserts that there is no such thing as a self-made man, that \\"the true origins of high achievement\\" lie instead in the circumstances and influences of one's upbringing, combined with excellent timing. The Beatles had Hamburg in 1960-62; Bill Gates had access to an ASR-33 Teletype in 1968. Both put in thousands of hours-Gladwell posits that 10,000 is the magic number-on their craft at a young age, resulting in an above-average head start.     Gladwell makes sure to note that to begin with, these individuals possessed once-in-a-generation talent in their fields. He simply makes the point that both encountered the kind of \\"right place at the right time\\" opportunity that allowed them to capitalize on their talent, a delineation that often separates moderate from extraordinary success. This is also why Asians excel at mathematics-their culture demands it. If other countries schooled their children as rigorously, the author argues, scores would even out.     Gladwell also looks at \\"demographic luck,\\" the effect of one's birth date. He demonstrates how being born in the decades of the 1830s or 1930s proved an enormous advantage for any future entrepreneur, as both saw economic booms and demographic troughs, meaning that class sizes were small, teachers were overqualified, universities were looking to enroll and companies were looking for employees.     In short, possibility comes \\"from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us with.\\" This theme appears throughout the varied anecdotes, but is it groundbreaking information? At times it seems an exercise in repackagedcarpe diem, especially from a mind as attuned as Gladwell's. Nonetheless, the author's lively storytelling and infectious enthusiasm make it an engaging, perhaps even inspiring, read.    [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]] is another of my favorites in this genre. I recommend it strongly because, unlike Gladwell's book, [[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]] shows you how to become an outlier...

B001FBSMF8|3.0|Listening to the lyrics, I guessing this cd is a by-product of the end of Cornell's marriage.  Chris Cornell went outside of his comfort zone on this one but I'm not sure it was successful overall. The songs blend together for a 14 title (1 hidden track) rock opera depicting the death of a love story.<br /><br />The Timbaland touch of pop appealed to me but I do not think it will appeal to most Cornell fans.  The droning beats that lead from one song into another at the beginning of this cd was a negative for me.  There were a lot of good tunes (\\"Enemy\\" \\"Scream\\" \\"Other Side of Town\\") that I will keep on my PC.  I was disappointed that certain songs (Part of Me) had better versions on the radio then on this cd.<br /><br />The overall mood appealed to me of love gone wrong set to pop beats.  This cd would be a great choice after a break-up.

0385341008|5.0|This is the best book I've read this year. Although it started out a bit slow, I was sucked in pretty quickly, and once the story got rolling, it never stopped being completely engrossing.<br /><br />I could really envision how this story unravelled. Perhaps it is because I've spent a lot of time working in the Channel Islands, visiting the beaches that were once covered with mines. Walking through the dark corridors of the German underground hospital, and climbing on the concrete machine gun batteries that looked out over the Channel, with France in the distance. I've seen the broken buildings, the fields of flowers for London markets. I've eaten the potatoes. I've been to St. Malo, and felt the strong tides. I've read the walls of names-some the same surnames as those I was working with-of those who tried to paddle to shore in the night, only to drown in the strong currents.<br /><br />When I checked the book out of the library, the librarian told me she had never even heard of Guernsey, and hadn't known it was a real place. I must admit, I was a tad horrified, but not terribly surprised. Everytime I flew across the Atlantic to visit the islands, I had to explain I was visiting the original Jersey, not the \\"New one\\". Don't worry. I set her straight. :)
B001W63DXC|3.0|OK, i've been a Maiden fan since the early 80's and saw them open for Priest with DiAnno in the lineup.  Musically I have no problem here.  It's just that Dickinson irritates the hell out of me with his incessant \\"Scream for me {insert city}!!!\\" which he does like 5 times in every song.  Whenever there's a musical lull or transition, he can't keep his mouth shut and has to do that routine.  It might be just me but I can't stand it anymore and will now only listen to the studio stuff.
B000001Y42|4.0|Okay, Limp Bizkit is now considered one of those 'tainted' bands because of some social stigma, perhaps that their style and message are too controversial for an audience that typically praises going against the grain.  Obviously Limp Bizkit is not a band for everyone, and there will always be ignorant people hurling insults at visible frontmen like Fred Durst, but you have to give the band some credit.  This IS a good album--it's got variety, which is more than most rap-metal bands can claim on an album.  I'm not saying that Limp Bizkit is anywhere near as influential as acts like Rage Against the Machine, but for what this is--a rock/rap album--it's great.  And it's really a shame that Limp Bizkit never really seemed to recapture the energy that pervades this album.  It's really heavy and a lot less catered toward platinum status than later albums--Chocolate Starfish, for one.  Of course, all Bizkit albums have some less than standard songs--especially after Wes Borland left.<br /><br />While I'm on the topic, whoever says that Wes Borland is a bad guitarist simply does not know the music.  The guitar work on this album is a great combination of heavy, fun-to-play riffs, more chordal harmonies, and the ambient sounds that fill the rest of the texture.  Seriously, listen to Big Dumb Face before you call Wes a bad guitarist.  And try playing along to Counterfeit--it's a lot of fun.  No, he's not Jimi Hendrix, but not every guitarist can be that talented.  Wes Borland does more for Limp Bizkit's sound than other band's guitarists, who could only hope for such creativity in writing parts for nu-metal songs.  He's original, and that's a big reason why I keep buying their music.  So stop hating.

Clearly, James Bond has nothing on this guy.<br /><br />As action thrillers go, \\"Taken\\" is considerably less plausible than most (which is saying a great deal), filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity, but director Pierre Morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping - which, let`s face it, is all one really asks for from a high-octane popcorn movie such as this one.<br /><br />To make the movie more \\"relatable\\" for the audience, screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which Mills has quit his job and moved to California so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter, only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection.  But all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and - good news for action fans - once the movie hits the throttle, it never lets up.<br /><br />The European tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film - and, seriously, all of this just to get some rich guys laid?  Don`t they have just regular old call-girls in Paris anymore? - but the commercial success of the movie has been nothing less than a godsend for Liam Neeson's career and pocketbook.<br /><br />With \\"Taken,\\" a new action hero is born.
B002CAWNEM|2.0|And Ali Larter ain't bad either, so the cat fight alone is worth two stars, even though within the first three minutes the director saw the need to foreshadow where the chick, err... I mean chips would fall. But really, Ali is way out of her weight class, and no where near as competitive as Missi Pyle in Bringing Down the House, as she goes a few rounds with the Queen Latifah dialogue spewing Knowles. Meanwhile somewhere, Michael Douglas is telling Catherine Zeta Jones pass the T-Mobile so he can call his attorneys to find out if the master copies for any more of his films are missing.  By the time I stopped paying attention I felt like I had dropped in on a Douglas film festival featuring Fatal Attraction, Disclosure and The Game with the climax of War of the Roses thrown in for full effect.<br /> [...]<br /> She might be deranged but her intuitiveness wasn't that far off seeing how Charles' possessive paranoid spouse, Sharon (Beyonce) used to be his secretary.  Lisa will not be deterred by any measure of obstacle, Derrick is the non-aggressive objectified prize of her fantasies and Sharon, well she's a woman who might look like the girl daddy always wanted you to marry but she obviously no stranger to applying an ample supply of Vaseline before a fight but regrettably 'thespianly' challenged.  Throw in Christine Lahti (in an absolutely throwaway role) as the investigating detective desperately in need of a clue, Jerry O'Connell [...]into oblivion) as the horny, wandering eye office best buddy and a stereotypically gay office assistant (Matthew Humphreys) who just has to gossip and before you know it, we've cut and pasted the middle third of Douglas's career.<br /><br />But for this movie derivative and clich&eacute;d are not enough, so inanity is tossed in to create a trifecta. At one juncture, Sharon kicks out Derrick because according to her logic he exhibited no trust in her although it has been made perfectly clear to the audience she had even less in him.  When she finally relents and the estranged couple agrees to re-unite after three months, the pound of flesh she exacts (in jest evidently) are the keys to his Benz even though she continues to tool around in her immaculately conditioned hybrid Escalade.  During this three month period BTW, Lisa makes no attempt to contact Derrick , when presumptively, he would be at his psychological low point.<br /><br />I'm only mildly pleased while the put upon couple had a toddler, they had not yet committed to a sacrificial pet.s and the estranged couple agrees to re-unite after three months, the pound of flesh she exacts (in jest evidently) are the keys to his Benz even though she continues to tool around in her immaculately conditioned hybrid Escalade.

B000Z0OX9O|5.0|I wasn't paying much attention it seems, when the 25th anniversary edition of Blade Runner came out, so I wasn't that interested. After all, I've worn laser grooves into my copy of the Vangelis CD for the 1982 version; and while iTunes reports its my number 2 album overall, I DIDN'T like the Director's cut (Ridley's Scott's last version) of the film (I much preferred the original Harrison Ford's narration overdubs, akin to Humphrey Bogart in the Maltese Falcon). Still, a director is allowed to rethink his life's work, so why not my own preconceptions (at least with the music).    So i gave it a try.     WOW.     Disc 1 was NOT the same as the 1982 release; it added 4 more cuts, some overdubbing from the film dialogues, and the tracks that were the same as the 1982 version appeared to be from different recording sessions (different tempos, different keys, different volumes, and so forth). It played like variations on a theme (like the Brandenburg Concertos); something different, something familiar, nothing boring. Some tracks were retitled as well from the 1982 release.    Volume 2 was MORE. Stuff that was missing from the 82 release (like Dr. Tyrell;s Death, and an extended version of Fading Away.     Volume 3 was WAY out there. Inspired by the premises of the film, it goes places the original wasn't allowed to go to (think My Life in the Bush of Ghosts by Eno/Byrne, or something by Jon Hassell). Techno-progressive in some places, and oddly retro in others, it certainly wasn't BORING! Or like the extra bonus music tracks from the Matrix Collector's Edition (adjuncts that didn't make it in due to time constraints, but continuing the music tradition).  Perfume Exotico was breathtaking and Launch Approval sounded like the prologue to the film (i could SEE the Replicants boarding the shuttle before hijacking it to Earth, and so, sparking Deker's mission). Piano In An Empty Room feels right at home with Harrison Ford/Sean Young in his apartment.    I highly recommend it(but if you have the original 1982 version, even more so; it expands on that release, gives you more perspective, another alternative take, and maybe, just an inkling into the creative process that must obsess over something we would take as minutae, but which in the end determines to the artist whether something has made the grade). IMHO, it did.      But decide for yourself.

0756405890|5.0|Ever have those moments in your life where you gradually stop doing something you love, and eventually you completely cease from doing it all. I had one of these moments for about a year prior to reading The Name of the Wind. I would maybe read a book every month or so. No big titles just books that kinda kept easing me off the path of reading, many of these books I read were for school anyways. I would read these books slowly and painfully.   I found The Name of The Wind one day and picked it up. I read the inside jacket and was hooked from then on. Unlike my previous books, I did not read this one slowly or painfully. Quite the opposite though.   I couldn't stop reading it till the end.  The writing was so amazing that it made me feel as if I was in the book. It made me love the characters and dive into the breathtaking story. The words danced on the pages into my imagination where the whole story was played to me.   It was written so beautifully that it made me want to become a writer and want to create masterpieces like this. Patrick Rothfuss has created a story and a land that will be read for ages and ages to come.  This book got me reading again.  For anyone that is reading this review right now and hasn't read The Name of the Wind, I urge you to stop reading reviews and read the book for yourself. This is my favorite book and I hope others can share in this masterpiece.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|ok.... to be honest here i reeeeaaaally wanna give this movie a two.  Why?  Because after i left the theater I could have sworn i had just paid to see Forest Gump again (this might even be considered a spoiler) I'm not even exaggerating when i say the story lines are just about completely identical.<br /><br />I gave it an extra star because it did provide some interesting characters... i suppose the movie was sad but to be honest i couldn't see it through my aggravation... don't get me wrong... i enjoyed Forest Gump... but damn..
B0000DJE9R|5.0|`Number Ones' is a good summary of Michael Jackson's signature songs and is a great album for introducing people to the King of Pop's arsenal.  In this album you can really receive good examples of why the man went to redefine the musical world as we know it.  His varying song mixture of passion, intensity, and innocence makes him one of the most diverse individuals to ever grace the airwaves (and that's not counting his superb showmanship on video and stage).<br /><br />Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough showcases the singer's early talent, and so does the slower-in-pace `Rock With You,' but there is nothing in these songs that can begin to hint at the greatness he would go onto achieve.<br /><br />We now jump forward to the songs that made him the international sensation we all know today: The Thriller era.  The trio of Billie Jean, Beat It, and Thriller make for one of the most infamous collections of songs to ever be spawned from a single-album (Thriller went on to, as many know, to be the best selling-album of all time).  Billie Jean is the slowest of the three, and is in many ways shows how Michael has shifted away from his Jackson 5 days.  Beat It, with a guitar solo provided by Eddie Van Halen is easily one of the greatest rock/pop songs of all time, as is the album's title song, Thriller.<br /><br />From here on out we receive hit after hit of Michael's very best work.  If you are wishing to be exposed to the work of one who many deem \\"The Greatest Entertainer of All-Time\\" than this album is a great place to start- or if you'd rather get started the old-fashioned way (like I did) go out and buy yourself a copy of Thriller and be swept away by what could be a perfect album.  If you choose to buy `Number Ones' I would recommend the tie-in DVD that exposes you to many of the performers best music videos, and as a combo that DVD and this CD are sure to hook just about anyone on the music of Michael Jackson.
B00284BMBM|1.0|This is what is wrong with the music world today.  Instead of putting interest in artists that are pushing the envelope and developing an oringinal sound, every mainstream yuppie without a clue in their head praises this HACK and pays(throws away) $20.00 to hear a handful of crappy songs that sound just like what every other lame band on the radio puts out.  Please, anyone who comes to this page considering purchasing this garbage, do yourself a favor and look up something with some substance, like Fugazi, Rob Crow, The Pixies, Witch,...Either that or just throw your computer out the window. STOP GLORIFYING MEDIOCRITY!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000TB014|4.0|`Number Ones' the DVD, along with the CD of the same name is a brilliant way to introduce newcomers to the talent of Michael Jackson- the KING of Pop.  Here on this single disc we essential get all his trademark songs and their videos (Yes, I know some trademark songs didn't have videos and thus are missing from this collection).<br /><br />The videos are as follows:<br /><br />1. Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough - A pretty typical music video for the 70s, featuring Michael singing with interchanging green-screen backdrops.  Jackson doesn't really beginning to show his trademark showmanship and dancing until the last few moments of the video.  So, good song, but the video certainly doesn't show you how innovative the artist shall become in the future.<br /><br />2. Rock With Me - More or less the same deal as the previous video, only the backgrounds are even less interesting.  Highlight is seeing a bit more full-body shots of Michael in movement than the previous video, and he gets to wear a nice glitter-jumpsuit.<br /><br />3. Billie Jean - Now we are entering into trademark King of Pop material with the music video that began Michael's task of redefining the genre.  Plenty of good sets and props and special effects, including the infamous light-up sidewalk.  The film is also the first to tell a story.<br /><br />4. Beat It - Another great music video, this one being for what could be Michael's best song, and features some of the best dance choreography of any of the icon's videos.  The story of this video is of Michael trying to address gang violence and preventing bloodshed as two rival gang-leaders enter into combat with knives drawn.  This is the song that would later be used by the Reagan Administration to discourage drunk driving, and earned Michael his first Government issued award.<br /><br />5. Thriller - Michel Jackson's most infamous music video - the most bought/downloaded music video of all time- is presented in its entirety on this DVD.  The 13-minute mini-movie, directed by John Landis, is a landmark in entertainment that completely redefined the potential of music videos, which at one time had simply been footage of bands performing with no real point other than to combine imagery with song.  The music tells of a strange boy (Michael) who isn't all right, and proves to his date that the supernatural seems to follow him.  This sets the stage for one of the most memorable dances in modern culture as Jackson puts on his moves with a horde of the living dead!<br /><br />6. Bad - Michael Jackson's follow-up album to Thriller presented this new-image of the pop star- one in which he runs around a New York Subway, in what can only be described as leather bondage gear (only children friendly).  The infamous director Martin Scorsese directed an 18-minute short film for Bad, but sadly this DVD only includes the shortened version (just the song and none of the story parts).  The dancing and performance by Jackson is still amazing.<br /><br />7. The Way You Make Me Feel - A good video, though this version omits the first few, introductory minutes.  Not really a problem because the dancing and music are what you care most about for this video.<br /><br />8. Man in the Mirror - One of Michael's first songs to feature mostly video-montage as opposed to an actual performance, this one using imagery of those in need and encouraging you to make a change to help others and the world.<br /><br />9. Smooth Criminal - I love this song, but could they not have edited the scene from Moonwalker in order for us to see the full-length video?  This is the cheap, edited version of the original music video.  This montage feels like an advertisement for the Moonwalker movie and not like an independent piece of art at all.<br /><br />10. Dirty Diana - What mostly seems like a live performance isn't too special, but the song and Jackson's stage-performance is electric.<br /><br />11. Black or White - This version edits out the controversial Panther scene, but other scenes (That Home Alone kid) are still involved.  Jackson is seen dancing with members of various cultures and the song is a cry for racial equality which, with its guitar orchestrated by Slash, is one of Jackson's best songs.<br /><br />12. You Are Not Alone - Not one of his better videos (features him and his first wife), but the song is one of the best love songs ever performed and Jackson (a man who was often alone) truly brings out every emotion the song is capable of.<br /><br />13. Earth Song - Another song featuring footage, only this time Jackson is present.  This is a very good song and is also a cry for peace and charity around the world, allowing Jackson to once again prove his positive ideals.<br /><br />14. Blood on the Dance Floor - A good video with a good song.  Doesn't stand out much compared to some of his other videos, but it is in no way a bad video.<br /><br />15. You Rock My World - This is another 10+ minute video from Jackson, this time featuring guest appearances by Chris Tucker and -a rather large- Marlon Brando.  Like Smooth Criminal the film is set in a film-noir environment, but never really reaches the greatness if obviously strove for.  Still, it does have its moments, and is, like all the others, not bad- just not as good.<br /><br />Overall this is a good video for new fans, but if you want \\"Making-Of\\" features, or ANY special features at all (this DVD has not a single extra feature) than you'd be best looking at the other MJ DVD releases, which, though more costly, will have the features you as a fan desire, as well as uncut versions of some of the above mentioned videos.son is seen dancing with members of various cultures and the song is a cry for racial equality which, with its guitar orchestrated by Slash, is one of Jackson's best songs.     12.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I absolutely adore this CD. I listen to it all the time. I am SO excited about the soundtrack for New Moon!! :)
B00005QGAX|5.0|Michael Jackson was an incredible artist in the way that he always was good at reinventing himself, his music, and of course his image.  Whether you scrutinize his odd behavior behind the stage, or not, it is impossible to deny the undeniable fact that this man was one of the most original performers of the 20th century- possible of all time (I consider him the most electrifying entertainer to ever grace this planet's surface- have for years).<br /><br />This album is just about as good Thriller.  Thriller of course wins because I feel that is is perhaps the only \\"perfect\\" album in existence.  While Thriller's song list and organization gave it incredible flow (much shorter than Jackson's later albums) Bad seems to be a lot more random in its song organization.  This is not a problem because this contains many of his greatest hits and is always fun to listen through.<br /><br />Though, for the most part, none of the songs are as perfect as Thriller's signature tunes it more than compensates for it by providing even more hits than the previous, record breaking album.  One thing's for sure, and that's `Bad' had several good, and a few great songs.  Jackson made sure to produce several more memorable tunes than most artists can in a lifetime.  Very few artists could release an album jam-full of hits, but Michael managed it several times- and even his lesser known works are well-worth looking into.<br /><br />Bad - The title song is quite the change of pace from Michael's previous work in Thriller, being the first song where he truly brings out some intensity in his tone- even in the creepy Thriller Michael still sounded like a nice guy.  Here he does sound like he could be relatively \\"bad.\\" The song is like funk being mixed with synthesized instrumentals.<br /><br />The Way You Make Me Feel - A very catchy, and upbeat courtship tune.  Perhaps the best of his \\"upbeat\\" love songs (his best -in my opinion- being the more dramatic \\"You Are Not Alone\\").<br /><br />Smooth Criminal - An exciting, incredibly fast-paced song that accounts the story of a girl by the name of Annie's murder.  Though it has a fast, relatively cheerful pace, -and his lyrics are often hard to make-out for first time listeners- if you do manage to get the lyrics it is actually one of the darker songs of his earlier career.<br />Like Wanna Be Startin' Something it is hard to pick the darkness in the lyrics, but the difference here is that the musical score gives it a far darker feeling.  Natural, since the song describes the brutal murdering of a girl by the name of Annie (\\"Annie are you okay?\\") by a \\"smooth Criminal.\\"  This is probably my favorite track on the Bad album.<br /><br />Man in the Mirror - One of the first of Michael's many charity based songs in which he gives his plea for humanity to change its way for the betterment of the world.  Without a doubt, one of his classic pieces of music, and it is sung with such great emotion.  Michael proves his ability to pluck the strings of human emotion with this piece, something he would do in many future \\"save the Planet/\\"change the world\\" songs.<br /><br />Dirty Diana -  A rock based song proves that the King of Pop would have been successful in any genre he chose.  The song centers on a woman by the name of Diana who tries to seduce men in positions of wealth and is one of his more intense songs.  Other good rock songs (which I feel are better) from the King of Pop include: Beat It (Thriller), and Give In To Me (Lesser known song from Dangerous).<br /><br />Leave Me Alone - One of the greater changes in pace for MJ's work, this is a song where he expresses obvious anger over the constant exploitation he receives at the hands of the media and tabloids.  Not his best song, but it definitely has the most unique tune on this album.<br /><br />Now let's get to the big question:  Did Michael take a huge step down from Thriller?  Well, anyone who says that this album doesn't live up to Thriller obviously set their expectations too high- I mean, seriously, there could only be ONE Thriller, and it wasn't going to be topped, and I'll tell you that Bad is worthy successor to Michael's incredible legacy.<br /><br />The man never gave in and constantly tried to change his style and that's why he was so successful: he didn't stay the same so he was always new.  Michael tried his best and always laughed-off the fact that he couldn't even beat his own album's record.be ONE Thriller, and it wasn't going to be topped, and I'll tell you that Bad is worthy successor to Michael's incredible legacy.

B0015DWJX2|4.0|I was not sure that a book written in all letter form would be that good but after a while you forget the style and become engrossed in the characters.  It took me a while to keep all the Channel Islanders straight but once I did it was a book I wanted to continue much to the detriment of my housework.  It was hard some times to think about all the hardships they went through at the hands of the Germans but even though it was fiction there was enough truth that you realized it truly was a terrible time for all of Europe.  The ending seemed a little short.  I wish that the romance could have been more developed in the late stages of the story so that it didn't seem so rushed.

B000M53GM2|4.0|Propelled by Martin Campbell's vigorous direction and Pierce Brosnan's stylish debut as 007, \\"GoldenEye\\" (1995) is solid Bond all the way. Terrific action scenes, memorable villains and Judi Dench's revitalized M are among the film's trump cards. Tina Turner's classic title song outshines a lackluster score by Eric Serra. It's a shame that Brosnan's remaining 007 installments failed to match the high standards of his first adventure.
0312997221|5.0|`Avenger' by thriller veteran Frederick Forsyth is everything a thriller should be with scintillating entertainment, historical information and astonishing twists. Forsyth introduces us to the nationalistic Cal Dexter and develops his character expertly skipping no details in the exposition on how he recruits himself for the army and develops his skills by joining the elite Tunnel Rats squadron while operating in Vietnam. After the Vietnam War, Dexter returns to his sovereign America and uses his military credibility to get a degree and eventually land a job as a small time attorney in the Bronx. Dexter later marries, but his family is hit with tragedy after tragedy, from the rape and murder of his young daughter to the suicide of his wife, devastated he becomes a dogged mercenary devoted to bringing foreign criminals to justice.     Forsyth writes an inimitably layered plot by concurrently involving us with the story of a compassionate young man Ricky Colenso who decides travel to war torn Bosnia as an aid worker to facilitate the dejected citizens who are brutally murdered in their thousands by the callous Milosevic regime. He is later viciously killed along with a whole village and discarded into a cesspit by the Machiavellian, vindictive Serbian war lord, drug dealer and weapons trader Zoran Zilic who utilises his ruthless army to commit terrible atrocities. Unknown to the vile Zilic and his band wagon of psychotic paramilitaries posing as patriots is that Ricky's grandfather Stephen Edmond is a wealthy business man who can afford the best revenge. Edmond later summons the services of `The Avenger' (Cal Dexter) to bring Zilic, who fleas with a small fortune to the fictional Republic of San Martin after the fall of Milosevic, to American justice.    To further obscure matters, the leader of an elite section of the CIA, dedicated patriot Paul Devereaux III recruits Zilic to eavesdrop on a weapons deal with a new terrorist Usama Bin Laden who poses a much larger threat to American lives. In doing so, Devereax needs to keep Zilic alive and when he hears of the Avenger's pursuit to capture Zilic, he is determined to stop him.     Dexter's extensive preparation and investigation along with almost symphonic implemntation and execution of plans are a pleasure to read and will ensure that anyone who finds enjoyment in the thriller genre will be hooked. Forsyth also provides plenty of history for the reader to enjoy to truly understand the Serbian Bosnian conflict and captures the surroundings and settings beautifully from the mountains of Serbia to the buildings of New York. Forsyth also doesn't fail to impress with his rigorous, scrupulous research of laws, countries and history, he builds the tension steadily and allows the novel to culminate in an unforgettable ending and a remarkable twist that will have you gasping for air.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|A great Western story of 2 tough old Texas Rangers on a Cattle Drive from South Texas to Montana. It's filled with just about everything that you would imagine on a drive of 2300 miles during the 1860's.  I have read the book twice & seen this movie countless times.  Missing this would be a mistake.
1416594884|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews here.  To me, this is vintage, classic le Carre.  I thought Mission Song was good, hated Absolute Friends, and found this to be a real step forward in terms of story.  It is a definite page turner, the characters are well drawn, and the story benefits from its setting in Germany, with which le Carre seems very familiar.  If you are a fan, don't let the negative or lukewarm reviews throw you.  They almost put me off this book, but it is classic le Carre!

I believe this book is better for the reading and writing part.I used another book called the michigan guide for better toelf test results and i believe that book is better at the listening and reading as well. Both books were good in the speaking section.I recommend getting both.
1423101472|4.0|I loved this book. Just like every other book in the series, it was wonderful. I love how the author twists Greek mythology into a hilarious comedy. I now know the name of all the Greek gods, thanks to Percy Jackson.   The Last Olympian is the final book in the Percy Jackson series. In the book, Percy must make a -not life changing- but world changing decision that comes on his 16th birthday. The evil Titan Kronos has risen and is attempting to overthrow Olympus. Percy must save all the gods, his classmates, and the humans of the world.     Pros: This book kept me staring at the pages until the end, sometimes authors lose their touch later on in the series, but Riordan kept the swords fighting the whole way through. I also loved how Riordan described the characters of the Gods, absolutely wonderful.     Cons: I do believe Riordan could have slowed down just a bit on the fighting. It's true that all the consistent fighting did keep my eyes glued to the page, but it would have been nice to hear Percy's thoughts more. I would have liked to hear Annabeth (Percy's friend and battle partner, daughter of the God Athena) talk MUCH more. She did say lots of things, but they were usually jokes or insults to Percy. Most of all she would be explaining her plan to Percy. I would have liked to hear her feelings more often, she could tell Percy she's scared or nervous instead of always being the brave one. It was like i didn't really know one part of her. Percy could also have talked about his feelings more, there never seemed to be a moment when he was vulnerable or weak. It would have been cute to see him tell Annabeth how he felt about her. It made no sense how they fight through the whole book, without saying pretty much anything but encouraging words for the battle to come, or fighting strategies, and then they end up together??? I was totally confused.     If you like fast-paced adventures, with brave heroes and monsters, this is the PERFECT book. If you are looking for a battle with a love story, this could be a disappointment.
B000KLRUKC|5.0|This 1959 recording of Aida by Herbert Von Karajan et al is often stated to be the greatest recording ever made of this opera. I have only heard bits of others, so I can't say that, but I can say it is sensational.<br /><br />Before we purchased this one, we only had a highlights CD by Claudio Abbado, Placido Domingo and others, but we were missing out on so much great music with that CD. It doesn't even include the triumphal march!<br /><br />The performances here are wonderful. The singers and orchestra do a fantastic job of portraying this stirring music.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Wow. I thought Seasons 1 and 2 were great, but this one tops them all. Just cannot believe the quality of this series. It rarely, if ever, hits a lull. The story progresses, Dean and Sam grow further into their roles. The semi-regulars show up and depart as needed. There is no clutter. The brothers' relationship is the focus. The writers for this show have to be considered among the best. Also, there is nothing gratuitous about the violence, language etal. Very taut stuff. Cant help thinking about season 4 [due out on September 1st]. Of course the only drawback was shortened season.
B001TOVXFM|5.0|This is probably the first \\"martial arts\\" film which does not rely on its martial arts to carry it.  Possibly this is due to the film being based on the real-life events of its progatonist, and the wonderfully-paced screenplay.  It's rare for an action film to develop its major characters so carefully, and lovingly, so by the middle of the film the audience actually feels the anguish of Ip Man and his family.      Don't get me wrong though, for those action kung-fu fans, there is much to rave about in this film as well.  Each action sequence is amazingly choreographed (by Sammo Hung of \\"Martial Law\\" TV fame), and masterfully enacted by Donnie Yen and the rest of the ensemble cast.      I must also mention the stunning quality of this Hong Kong edition of this film.  The visuals are crystal-clear, as is the audio (in DTS-HD).  I played this on a Hi-Def 50 inch plasma screen and I would swear this is in HD, even though I played it on my standard DVD player.  The sound effects were also superb; the clash of steel oftentimes caused me to duck!  The English subtitles were also perfect--even on the special features (I particularly enjoyed the ones detailing the background history of the WingChung art, and of Ip Man himself).      Overall this is an astounding edition which my family and I will treasure for years to come.
1439138311|4.0|When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I would be able to get through it.  It is told in 3rd person - which I am not a huge fan of.  However, I stuck with it and as the main character Eilis started to develop, I was drawn into the story and couldn't stop reading it.  Toibin's writing is beautiful!<br /><br />The story starts out in Ireland where the main character, Eilis, lives with her mother and sister, Rose, in a small town.  There isn't much work or opportunity for Eilis in the town.  When Rose arranges with a preist for Eilis to go and work in America, the family seems to be pretty happy.  Eilis is apprehensive at first but agrees to go after seeing that this is what her family wants from her.<br /><br />When Eilis reaches America, she lives in a boarding house with other girls that are around her age.  She has a job working the floor at a department store.  She begins to become very homesick and depressed.  The priest sets her up in classes at a local college to help her advance in America and prevent her from being alone and homesick.<br /><br />Eilis seems to be making her way very well in America.  She is good at her job and doing well in her classes.  At a church dance, she meets Tony (an Italian man) who makes her laugh.  They begin a relationships and Tony falls in love with Eilis.  Eilis doesn't seem to be too sure of her feelings for Tony but eventually falls in love with him.  The love story is beautifully written and I loved this part of the book.<br /><br />Suddenly, Eilis is struck when she learns of news from home that a great tragedy has happened.  I will not give away any spoilers here - but Eilis is devestated.  She turns to Tony for support and he is there for her to see her through.  Eilis decides to go back to Ireland for a month to visit and help sort out what has happened.  Tony is apprehensive about letting her go but she assures him that she will return to America and to him.  Once Eilis goes to Ireland, I feel that the story sort of falls apart for me.<br /><br />I felt that going to America had made Eilis super confident and sure of herself - but when she goes to Ireland, I wonder if it was all just a facade?  I would recommend this book to friends, however I would warn them in advance of how much I disliked the ending.I felt that going to America had made Eilis super confident and sure of herself - but when she goes to Ireland, I wonder if it was all just a facade?

B000V5TV22|2.0|Used in van for about 3 months.  Very fast satellite fixes, excellent performance until - it suddenly would stop communicating with my PC.  Quickly (one day) stopped working altogether.  Since it was out of warranty, I took it home and disassembled.  What I found was the solder joint that attaches the chipset to the cable had almost no solder on it, the connection was simply from mechanical pressure.  So after bouncing around on my dash for 3 months it jarred loose, and no more GPS.  An email to USGlobalSat received absolutely no response.  So now I know why they have a 60 day warranty.  Too bad, it really works great while it works.
B001SMC91M|5.0|It's good to hear the funk/blues/soul coming back.  It's not over produced, just talented musicians getting into a groove, and bringing you with them.    If you like old school blues, with a twist of newness, this is the album for you.  The songs will have you tapping (and stomping) along to the music.  Gunpowder starts this album off on a very blues/funk foot, Sugarfoot gets you rocking, and then smoothes you right into the rest of the album.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have been looking at WW2 documentaries for years, and this is the best that I have ever seen.  This set has footage that I have not seen anywhere else.  I am usually not interested in interviews in documentaries, but they have interviews with VERY big name people from both sides.  They also cover \\"theaters\\" of the war such as Burma, that are frequently not covered in other documentaries.  If I could only afford to buy one WW2 documentary, I would definitely buy this one.
B00284BMBM|5.0|As much as I like \\"No Surprise\\", the sizzling, energetic first single off Daughtry's Leave This Town (the follow-up to their multi-platinum self-titled debut), I'm even more impressed with the quality of the rest of the songs.  Creative and original (especially considering this is mainstream pop/rock), this collection eliminates much of the 'cookie-cutter' nature that I felt many of those songs had while retaining hook-laden melodies that made it so successful commercially.    Dubbed by Chris as \\"a very big rock album\\", this sophomore effort starts that way with \\"You Don't Belong\\", a heavy rocker filled with '80's-inspired guitar riffs and power chords.  Rather than using studio musicians as the debut did, Chris' bandmates recorded the musical tracks, and that's one of this album's major highlights and improvements.  The almost not-stop touring allowed the band to develop chemistry, and the resulting cohesiveness shows through on the recording, giving this album a more loose, 'live' feel.     \\"Every Time You Turn Around\\" keeps the rock edge going...the band members were given latitude to \\"throw things in on the fly\\"...an extra solo line here, an extra cymbal crash there, and this song is a good example of that.  \\"Life After You\\" finally slows things down a bit, but that's not a bad thing on this record.  The string of mid-tempo or slower songs that dominate the rest of the album are not contrived or 'manufactured'-sounding...in fact, Chris' weathered voice bleeds passion and sincerity combined with his relatable relationship-themed lyrics.  The production allows 'holes' to open up for the vocal(s) to be heard clearly.    Chris (collaborating with some of his rock 'buddies' and producers, including Nickelback's Chad Kroeger on two songs) seems to have honed his songwriting skills further...his almost innate ability to craft melodies and write lyrics from the heart continues to grab you and reel you in, without 'recycling' too much from the first record.  Two songs inparticular stand out for me... \\"September\\", a heartfelt ballad about growing up in the summertime in his small, North Carolina hometown but having to leave things behind to move forward, and \\"Tennessee Line\\", a country-flavored tune (fiddles and all) featuring country legend Vince Gill on background vocals.  Unique and captivating, these gems are refreshing to hear while staying within the confines of the basic formula for Daughtry's success.  While returning producer Howard Benson throws in a few extra production tricks here and there, he manages to keep the sound fairly natural and the enhancements aren't too overdone.    The bottom line:  Great songs, solid performance, and an overall stronger rock attitude.  I'm not sure if the changes would be enough to win over those who didn't like Daughtry before, but if you did enjoy Daughtry Part 1, the sequel isn't likely to disappoint.
015206396X|4.0|A fun YA book that has some unique ideas and plots around it. Exactly what I was looking for this week - a light read that captured my attention and imagination. Katsa is an interesting heroine, and I'm definitely hoping there are sequels coming out sometime in the future.
B001V9LRV0|4.0|Me gusto mucho esta edicion de DVD , pero me pareceque se quedaron un poco cortos en los referente a la musica, pues tengo el Woodstock Diary que salio en Europa , y tiene tal cantidad de canciones que no aparecen en esta edicion que me parece increible, como el caso de Qill  ,The Band y Joe Cocker el cual solo aparece una cancion nunca antes vista.<br />En todo caso esperemos salgan los grupos que sabemos que tocaron pero que no aparecen ni en la foto<br />gracias<br />Ricardo Rivera Rodriguez
B00004T9UF|5.0|I know I am 9 years late to review this album, but I needed to give it the review it deserved anyways. For anybody who is an Eminem fan, the Marshall Mathers LP is generally regarded as Em's best work. For anybody who is a fan of rap in general, this album is arguably one of the finest ever released. There is not a single track on this disc that is worth skipping over, even the skits do a good job leading into other tracks, and although typically \\"filler\\", there never seems to be an itch (even after countless spins) to skip over any of them.    The lyrical content here is what really draws you in. This is Eminem at his rawest, and the shock factor still registers this far into the album's life. Although some tracks have that off the wall childish humor, the majority are made up of angst-driven yet mature subject matter that will connect even with an older audience. It's controversial, it's deep, it's though provoking and still capable of producing conversation between two people if listened to together. If you haven't purchased this album yet (I have no idea why you wouldn't) you need to get it now. If you've lost your copy, you need to pick up another one. Anybody who is a music fan needs to have this record in their collection.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|When one waits 16 hours in a line to ensure they get good seats to a movie, it'll have to be one darn good film that they are seeing to make it worth it. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that `Half-Blood Prince,' the latest installment in the insanely popular Harry Potter franchise, is one darn good movie and would have been worth another six hours at least.<br /><br />A long time has passed since Harry and Co. sat around the Great Hall and played wizard chess while worrying about their exams.  As year six dawns for our young heroes, everything, including their beloved Hogwarts, has a dark and menacing existence. Even the muggles are beginning to feel the effects of the rising evil in the wizarding world.<br /><br />And so begins Year 6.<br /><br />`Half-Blood Prince' is, despite the times, far and away the funniest of the Potter films.  The excellent writing is sharp, and downright hilarious at times. Steve Kloves really did a wonderful job of balancing the screenplay with a perfect combination of wit and storytelling, the end result being a film that is perfectly paced with not a dull moment to speak of. Superb writing.<br /><br />The acting is, across the board, near-perfect. The three young stars all shine in their respective rolls. Daniel Radcliffe plays well the reluctant yet determined hero. He also shows his comedic side in an insanely memorable scene featuring Felix Felicius, liquid luck. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, despite not playing as large a roll as Radcliffe, are also excellent. Grint's dead nuts tone and facial expressions absolutely make the awkward romances that permeate the story.  A run in with a love potion gives Grint an opportunity to prove his comedic talents, and, boy, does he deliver.  Watson, on the other hand, is possibly the most improved and probably the best.  She has gotten her eyebrows under control for this one and is charming as Hermione.  While hers is a more serious role, she comes through brilliantly as well, especially in an emotional scene in which she is very convincing.<br /><br />Also, the supporting cast is phenomenal.  Michael Gambon is excellent as Dumbledore, and Jim Broadbent proves a worthy addition to the cast as Professor Slughorn, a professor returning to teach at Hogwarts.  Bonnie Wright, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Helena Bonham-Carter round off the wonderful cast. Special mention to Tom Felton, who steps up to a larger role as the conflicted Draco Malfoy and does a superb job.<br /><br />By the time you near the end of this movie, you may have trouble believing how it will end. Sure, through the laughs, you learn bits and pieces of the dark and mysterious past of Voldemort, but so far it has not been extremely heavy. Then comes the last half hour, which is perhaps the best part of the film. As Harry and Dumbledore travel to a dark cave in search of a missing piece of Voldemort's past, the tone of the whole film changes dramatically.  This change is handled perfectly, and catapults the viewers to the shocking and ultimately sobering end.<br /><br />I will admit, it has been a while since I read the novel upon which this film is based. That said, I cannot vouch completely for the quality of the adaption. I can, however, think of several things that were added or taken away, right off the top of my head. Unlike with some of the films, however, these changes seem completely natural and irreprehensible.  I felt that the changes were handled well and for the bettering of the film and the franchise. To watch it without comparing it strictly to the book is how, ultimately, this film will be enjoyed fully.<br /><br />One such change, at the end, is a funeral that has been removed from the film.  In it's place, however, is a wonderful sentiment by the teachers and students of Hogwarts that is an extremely emotional and a stirring symbolism. Just as the end of the book, it brought tears to my eyes. While it was different from the book, it was still extremely effective, andbrought the heart of the novel to the screen.<br /><br />The very last scene, in which Harry, Ron and Hermione discuss what will happen going forward, speaks to them as well as the audience. Nothing will be the same. They know that everything they have done to this point has been leading up to an epic climax that will decide the fate of the world. Just so, the audience not only sees, but FEELS the epic battle that is looming. And as Harry aptly observes of the school that will never be the same: \\"I'm just beginning to realize how beautiful this is.\\"<br /><br />The same could be said of the Harry Potter franchise.scene, in which Harry, Ron and Hermione discuss what will happen going forward, speaks to them as well as the audience.

B001FSDOZO|2.0|Nickelback has always caught a lot of slack from fans of Modern Rock as being too commercial and too pop-like for many to digest without feeling a sugary guilt afterwards. I think Nickelback took a lot of their critics' words to heart, and tried to push out a record that was out of their style and thusly comes up empty. It seems to me they watered down their lyrics (even MORE than ever) and went down the hard rock path of Modern Rock that can only be treaded by a select few successfully (Another Black Day, Burn Halo, etc).    This style just does not work for them, and although it is evident they tried exceptionally hard to produce a harder, less \\"mainstream\\" sound for this record, the content just didn't come in at par, much less under. There are still a couple stand out tracks (Such as \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\") that make this album worth 2 stars, but unless you find it hard to breathe without listening to Nickelback, I would purchase just a few select tracks, and avoid the rest of this disc like the plague.
B00006LIRI|3.0|Back when this CD came out, digital downloads were still in their infancy. Thus, this CD presented a great opportunity for the casual U2 fan to pick up some good songs from some not-so-good albums.  Today with the ease of buying individual songs, there is not a whole lot of reason to buy this.  The CD also seems to be missing a number of the 'hits' from the time period (\\"The Fly\\" and \\"Who's Going to Ride Your Wild Horses\\" are both missing from Achtung Baby.)  It does have a few new mixes of some of the \\"Pop\\" and \\"Zooropa\\" era songs.  They all tend to be fairly close to the original, so would make a good substitute for a casual fan (and not an urgent purchase for the serious fan.)  I did like most of them a little better than the original CD versions.    Some of the other non-album tracks are also yawners (with the exception of the Batman theme.)  I found it interesting they included the Passengers song, while omitting the \\"Mission Impossible\\" theme.  (I guess a 'psuedonym' including all the band members trumps a couple band members using their real names.)
B000FBGBPC|4.0|Three Days Grace has quickly grown into one of the most popular Modern Rock outfits on the airwaves, and very rightly so. \\"One-X\\" demonstrates the growth of the band in the couple of years between this release and their debut album \\"Three Days Grace\\". It has an amazingly dark and angst-driven crunch the entire way through, although the lyrical depth is still lacking, it's pretty much expected by bands of this particular genre anyways so I don't suggest this if you are expecting something that doesn't come riddled with relationship problems and sometimes depressing lyrical content.    However, you can get past what is in the words rather easily if you like this sort of music anyways, and the album does a great job of holding your attention all the way through. It does tend to get a bit repetitive, which is why I only gave this disc 4 stars as opposed to the 5 I was originally considering since the freshness wears off rather quickly, especially if you are re-listening to it after a long period of time.    Overall I definitely recommend this to people who are fans of radio-rock, and even those who like the more underground side of Modern Rock.    Standout tracks: \\"Animal I Have Become\\" \\"Let It Die\\" \\"Time of Dying\\"
0399250395|4.0|I love to buy pop up books for my children, but like to wait till they are old enough to appreciate it and not tear it to pieces!  This is the first for my 4 year old, and he loves it!  He loves to read and pop-up books engage him in a whole new way.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|When I first picked this album up in late 2006 I didn't fully appreciate it and kind of set it aside as I was still looking for that more hardcore Rise Against I fell in love with in High School. However, it didn't take long for me to get back around to listening to it, and when listened to with an unbiased ear, \\"The Sufferer and The Witness\\" is one of the (if not THE) greatest albums released by Rise Against. The production quality on the disc is superior and the band just blends and flows so well over the course of the entire album. I can honestly say I don't think there is a single track on here that I just cannot stand to listen to, each and every song is so enjoyable and they all give you that \\"feel good\\" feel while listening. I highly recommend this CD.
0061767581|3.0|I have followed LC since Laguna Beach, Im in my thirties and felt this book was written rather simply. I was suprised she actually had professional assistance while writing it. It was very :\\"jane and I had drinks, then I got a text\\". I expected more and wonder if the reason I was not enthrawled was due inpart to my age. Although I once was a teenager. Growing up in NY and having attended clubs as a teen, I found my own life more exciting than the tales in this book. An ok read, a small glimpse was given into the filming of The Hills and I will get the second part, but all in all not for readers over the age of 14
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I have been listening to Shinedown since 2003 when they were working the local scene in Florida and just making a ripple in the Modern Rock pool (or should I say ocean?) with Leave A Whisper. Well, I was highly anticipating their 3rd release, \\"The Sound of Madness\\" and even with the high expectations I had, Shinedown was able to deliver an album that impressed me even more than LAW. This disc is fuller, and has a much better sound quality to it than either of their previous records, and that translates into a smoother, more polished finish. It's unfortunate the limited fan club release is no longer available as the three bonus tracks alone made it worth buying the entire album.     But even this \\"basic\\" album is near flawless, when you can say the first single (Devour) is likely the weakest song on the entire record, you know its hitting on all cylinders. I am very excited for the band that they have finally hit on the recognition they have always deserved, and cannot wait for whatever they do next. This album is a definite must have for ANYBODY.

B000002C2E|5.0|It was clear this was a unique Bob Dylan album when it first appeared and now that time has past, already over a decade now(!), \\"Time Out of Mind\\" has not only withstood the test of time, but grown in stature.<br /><br />What went into the creation of this album? The album is clearly the result of a collaboration between Dylan and producer Daniel Lanois who's love for a rich, moody, atmospheric sound is fully present. Many of these songs Dylan had written years before and he has stated that they describe him personally at the time of their recording in 1997. Also of interest is that Dylan claims this to be the only album of his that he listens to, but none the less was not satisfied with the sound. While expressing respect for his two time producer (Lanois produced Dylan's best 1980s album \\"On Mercy\\") he has notably since gone on to produce his own albums, \\"Love and Theft\\", \\"Modern Times\\", \\"Together Through Life\\". But again, why is THIS album special? All I can figure is that the songs were a long time in the making and came right from the heart. In the end it's just fantastic writing from one of America's greatest song writers. He seemed to have struggled for a long time with problems in life many of us face, endured a creative slump which lasted many years, and these songs marked a return--but from an older man who has seen it all, done it all. This album is a deeply spiritual album, even to those of us that don't share Dylan's faith.<br />For a fascinating analysis I'd recommend you see \\"Time Out of Mind...With New Eyes\\" by Ronnie Keohane.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|The product was just as described.   Transition was very smooth and hope to do business again.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|This is a worthy cover album. Not bad at all and it's interesting too, hearing younger generation musicians cover and interpret Dylan songs. There are some old timers here too tho, which is cool. Dylan is served well, seems to me, when disentangled a little more from the shadow of the 1960s, a decade the often media still seems is hell bent on imprisoning him. Bob Dylan's music surely belongs to no single generation. If it did I wouldn't listen to him, I'd hate him. Anyway, here's some covers that stand out to me:<br />Sonic Youth's \\"I'm Not There\\"<br />John Doe's \\"Pressing On\\"<br />Richie Haven's \\"Tombstone Blues\\"<br />Jim James and Calexico's \\"Goin to Acapulco\\"<br />Marcus Carl Franklin's \\"When the Ship Comes In\\"<br />I felt Cat Power's \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile...\\" -- kinda weak, imo. And there are some other versions that aren't too great and one or two that I should add to the highlight list. One version that is really standout is \\"I'm Not There\\" by Bob Dylan with the Band. Maybe the best song here.
1878424319|1.0|This book is a poorly written, self aggrandizing impiety.<br /><br />There's a reason why cultures die. Because they no longer serve the current belief system of the advancing culture. However, since this whole \\"ancient belief system\\" was enshrouded in mystery, one can't question if Miguel's ridiculous tautology is fiction or fact. Which I'd imagine that he understood (that's why it's a secret) and is crucial to his marketing campaign--granting exemption to personal accountability and empathy.<br /><br />Usually when cultures live in secret it's because their beliefs are too abhorrent (think KKK) for the current societal values. We've been advanced for a while now, I'm guessing that the one thing that the ancient human sacrificing aztecs and our current society have in common is that we are all allergic to sociopaths.<br /> [[ASIN:1878424505 The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, A Toltec Wisdom Book]]
B001DJLD1M|1.0|Well, it is more deceiving than rip-off (can't beat the price even for two movies) but it is also very disappointing to see that one of the discs contains identical movies of the other.  While both are labeled properly (inner circle had the right inscription) the movies are identical so this must be a manufacturing problem - the \\"first\\" disc had Matrix 1 on the first side and Matrix 2 on the other side while the second disc was identical to the first even though it was labeled correctly.    I would suggest to stay away from this because you'll never know what you will end up with. Other comments say they got Animatrix and Matrix 3 twice.     Also, there are only two discs so the data is recorded on both sides. This is a big minus for optical media. It stores more data on a physical disc but at a cost of fingerprints and scratches.  I bought this brand new from Walmart and it already had tiny scratches.  I'm going to return this and get a refund!
0385737424|5.0|\\"When You Reach Me\\" is a rare gem of young adult fiction:  an involving story whose subtle writing and characterization pull you in as much as the mystery that binds the story together.  I liked the slice of life of 1979 New York as twelve-year old Miranda and her friends explore their neighborhood, giving us a bit of a [[ASIN:0470471948 Free-Range Kids]] perspective on days gone by.     Miranda gains and loses friends, and grapples with normal sixth-grade angst, but her worries take on a new twist when she discovers mysterious notes from someone who tries to convince her that he or she can see things that have not happened yet, adding fantasy and sci-fi into this realistic setting where you'd least expect it.  Once the mystery has been solved, many readers will want to go back and read the story a second time to see how the pieces fit together in a new light.    In a thematic parallel, Miranda's experiences reflect her own shifting ability to see situations through other people's eyes.  She also learns that giving or withholding small acts of kindness or meanness can have big consequences.  What I love though is that the story is told in a way that does not feel at all preachy.    This is a great book for anyone ages 10 and up.  It would be okay for younger kids, but those readers have so many choices that I would save \\"When You Reach Me\\" for age 10, because in my experience it's harder to find good books for that age.  Also, the point of view of the story is a bit tricky (skillful, but unconventional), as Miranda writes to her mystery correspondent, which could be confusing for younger readers but an interesting challenge for older kids.    As an adult reader and I thoroughly enjoyed \\"When You Reach Me.\\"  (I am actually Miranda's \\"age,\\" 11 in 1979, and I loved the part about her Mom's obsession with the $20,000 Pyramid.  Brought back memories.)  In the story Miranda talks a lot about her favorite book, one that has captivated readers from the 1960's to today, [[ASIN:0312367546 A Wrinkle in Time,]] and I would recommend reading that first!
B000P0J0EW|1.0|My neighbour J&eacute;sus gave me a bunch of movies to see that were supposedly \\"classics\\"... 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Requiem for a Dream.. they were all horrible! So he told me to check out The Shawshank Redemption because it was #1 on IMDb, so it has to be good. This movie was horrible! The first thirty minutes were about some murderer dropping the soap too many times, then a little while later some old guy becomes an hero, then they go to Mexico and hang out on the beach. It's predictable and full of generic film cliches. Also, there isn't a love interest or sex scenes!! What gives??<br /><br />Check out Showgirls, Little Nicky, Lost in Space, On Deadly Ground, Waterworld or Unbreakable for quality films!

This old hippie with a long white beard and ponytail told the bartender to play some Allman Brothers to show \\"this kid what real southern rock is\\". Needless to say I hated it!

B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I was highly impressed and very relieved by my first viewing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  Impressed because the film is a fine adaptation of the book while relieved that the unfortunate skimping of detail which so marred Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not as apparent.  The Harry Potter series is a rare exception to the rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.<br /><br />Naturally any book with as many subplots and characters as Half Blood Prince cannot be completely transferred to film  Some things are cut, like the Dursleys, while others are added, as in an early scene showing Harry at a Muggle diner.  What was cut did not mar the story and the additions were mostly in keeping with the overall tone.  Dark times have come to the wizard world.  Voldemort is extending his power, and even Muggles recognize that dark forces are at work.  Harry is now recognized by his fellow wizards as The Chosen One, and as a typical 16 year old it has gone to his head a bit.  He is torn between his need to be a teenager dealing with his emotions and those of his friends and would be lovers and his inescapable fate as the nemesis of the Dark Lord.<br /><br />In The Half Blood Prince we learn more about the early history of Lord Voldemort, and these scenes are among the best in the film, showing young Tom Riddle in a Muggle orphanage and later as the most gifted and troubled student at Hogwarts.  We get some hints of what is to come in the final Deathly Hallows movies, but not so much that those who have not yet read the last book will have that experience ruined.  Though the overall tone is dark, there are some supremely hilarious moments, mainly dealing with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione's personal lives, as well as a very well portrayed Horace Slughorn.  The returning cast members continue to do remarkable job and we get more insights into some of their characters, particularly those of Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape.<br /><br />The film is greatly enhanced by its fine soundtrack, some of it carryovers from  earlier films (like the overall theme music) including a couple of my favorites from The Order of the Phoenix: Fireworks and Dumbledore's Army.its fine soundtrack, some of it carryovers from  earlier films (like the overall theme music) including a couple of my favorites from The Order of the Phoenix: Fireworks and Dumbledore's Army.
B001ECQ6YW|1.0|A horrible storyline can spoil even the best of films.<br />American film-makers have this neverending love for stereotyped underdog stories with the brave character who finds his true self and achieves success despite most unpromising circumstances. I suppose it is a manifestation of a stereotyped image of the American dream, this feeding the average viewer with the idea that anyone can have a dream an make a success out of it.<br />This underdog storyline can be sometimes exploited with originality and effectiveness (take Hercules and Mulan, to remain to cartoons) but it can also be a tricky path to choose as it is fully demonstrated here.<br /><br />That animation is excellent (and yet computer tricks are a little TOO evident and mechanical looking) and rhythm serrated, that voice-acting is professional and funny turns out not to be enough.<br />This movie is not good, not even for children actually, not because of any improper adult content but because the ethics conveyed here are simply not healthy for a kid.
B0014I4KIK|1.0|Back in the day Paula Abdul looked cute in short skirts too. She couldn't sing either. Pity Adelle is a plain Jane tub. At least she can sing.
B001CZVVWS|5.0|Aida has been a favourite of mine for over 50 years but had not been looked at for awhile.  So it was a great pleasure to reacquaint myself with the music.  This production, filmed by Zeffirelli, is a sumptuous one although the frequent dissolves into out of focus waving cloth could be distracting at times and was a bit over done for me.<br />But the singing is brilliant, particularly Ildiko Komlosi in the role of Amneris.  For some reason I have previously always regarded the role of Aida as the pivotal one but this production clearly demonstrates the importance of Amneris with her intense passion for our hero Radames, sung by Roberto Alagna.  This is not meant to depreciate the great singing of Violeta Urmanda in the title role.  The chorus is great although a more powerful Ramfis than Giorgio Giuseppini would have not gone astray.<br />The sets, costumes and lighting are top notch in this traditional presentation although the ballet scenes were somewhat wimpy.<br />The lack of audience applause at times was puzzling as Italian audiences are unrestrainedly enthusiastic, so it is hard to imagine Zeffirelli was able to persuade them to keep silent. So, it is possible some of it was filmed without an audience although no change in acoustics was obvious.<br />Yes, the sound is glorious and the video quality impeccable.  This would be a good first opera for someone to cut their teeth on.  Highly recommended.<br />POSTCRIPT:  Just read some of the other reviews (I always write mine before looking) and can appreciate others found Zeffirelli's approach distracting, but to me the singing was good enough to forgive that.  Yes, it was hard to appreciate Aida, as portrayed by Violetta, as being someone to risk life and reputation for, but her brilliant singing made me overlook this.  And I agree Alagna was unimpressive in the first Act but redeemed himself at the end. Yes, the final production does come through as a \\"stitched up\\" effort combining some live production with some that is not.  So yes, a mixed bag, but a worthwhile one IMHO.yes, a mixed bag, but a worthwhile one IMHO.

B001C64U48|5.0|I do not believe that I could add any more to the praise for Fritz Lang's ground-breaking SciFi classic. Instead I will just add a bit of information for someone that is trying to track down a copy of Giorgio Moroder's fantastic version with his Rock based soundtrack.       The Giorgio Moroder version of Metropolis was released on VHS by Vestron Video, PO Box 4000, Stamford, Ct 06907. The VHS tape has a part number of VA5090 and a UPC of 0-28485-15090. I was lucky enough to buy this from a Video store clerk for $85 about 18 years ago. This version has a fantastic sound track and is really fun to watch. The Moroder version was also released on Laser Disc. Both versions are 87 minutes.        This version would of course be perfect for re-mastering to Blu-ray. One can only hope.
0765350386|4.0|This one has been eyeballing me for a while now. Finally decided to pick it up and I'm glad I did.    The way magic is used is thoroughly thought out and very interesting. The plot is top notch. The story rarely drags and the action sequences  are written spectacularly. The beginning reminded me of the Sting or Ocean's 11 a little. However, by the end of the book the story develops into something much more grand and fulfilling. Even though this is the first of a trilogy, the ending is very satisfying. If you didn't want to read the rest of the books, you would walk away without feeling cheated.    Would have given this a 5 star, except for a few things. The 2 main characters are very fleshed out and believable, however the supporting cast falls a bit short. The magic while very interesting, has very few words to describe how it is used. This can get a bit repetitive, but the rest of the action will keep you going.    After I found out that the author is going to be finishing up the Wheel of Time, I might just have to get caught up with that series to see how he wraps it up. All in all this is a wonderful book and Mr. Sanderson has a reader for life.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Yes, the action scene only pumps up toward the end of the film, but boy does it really start then. Also, the pacing is right, building up story for the big battle at the end.<br />I warn of the violence that might come a bit unexpected when the first kills happen. But this is a Tarantino movie, so it shouldn't come as a surprise to you that a few lives end here.<br />Is Russel a good cast for his role? Perfectly.<br />Since playing Snake Plissken he is known to be able to deliver cool lines. Words do not come short here and all the dialogue that Tarantino gives us is cool and fun.<br />Lean back and enjoy the ride

B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|Of course you all realize that, when all of the actors portraying our favorite crew will age into the original series character's age, they will not at all look the same. They already don't. So when your sons - or grandsons, as none of us are getting any younger - asks the embarassing question: 'Dad, why do these same persons with the same names and at the same age look entirely different from one another?' You will have to fumble an answer like: 'Well, son, a totally senile pointed-ear character chose to travel back in time and create a different timeline in which, for starters, planets Vulcan and Romulus have been annihilated.' That's right, folks, everything from the first timeline, of which you bought all the DVDs, has been irrevocably eradicated. (Of course now you have to consider giving away all of those now-obsolete DVDs to some carefree young nephew in the hope of turning him into a young first-timeline trekkie... good luck!) Furthermore, it clearly appears that in that second timeline, time itself moves at an incredibly accelerated rate. We could easily call it the dynamite timeline. It is a much more thunderous universe in which exploding events ceaselessly cascade into one another. No time for idle recollection here, folks. And not too much depth either. Not a hint of resemblance whatsoever with the very first movie, 'Star Trek The Motionless Picture' of the old, verging on ancient, timeline. Look out for a new, exciting, faster-than-a-commercial Star Trek movie every two years.
1416550518|5.0|THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON was Kate Morton's debut novel in April of 2008. It's a sweeping, somewhat haunting tale that takes place in England between the first and second world wars. It tells the story of not only Lord Ashbury's family, who lived at Riverton House, but also the staff who made the household run smoothly and effieciently for so many years.    Grace Bradley, who began working as a servant at Riverton in 1914 at the age of 14, is the narrator. She is now in her nineties, living in an assisted living facility facing her own mortality, the others having already gone long before her. She has been approached by a filmmaker who wants to tell the story of the poet, who in 1924 committed suicide beside the lake at Riverton during a lavish society party. According to reports, the only witnesses were sisters Hannah and Emmeline Hartford, grand daughters of the late Lord Ashbury. This is not the first time Grace has been asked to share her experiences, but before now, she's always refused. However, with all the memories that come flooding back as she visits the house all these years later, she feels that it is time to tell the story - the real story of that tragic night at the lake. But in doing so she must also reveal other secrets that she buried decades earlier as part of her loyalty to the family. Some of these secrets will only make the events more tragic, while others will change lives, even today.    One of the things that drew me to this story is the time and location it takes place. The more I read historical fiction, the more I adore it - especially stories of old England and it's traditions. Another reason I think I like this novel so much is that it reminds me of THE THIRTEENTH TALE. It's not as Gothic as Setterfield's book, but has similiar characteristics.    In this novel, Kate Morton has woven a beautiful story of a prominent family with the heartbreak of loss the wars bring, the loneliness those left behind endure, as well as the anguish of those whosurvived the war, only to continue the battle in their minds once they returned home. The story is so well crafted, it unfolds seamlessly, allowing each revelation to exposes itself naturally yet surprisingly. Add to that the superbly developed characters. There's an honesty about them that creates such a realistic picture of their lives. Through Grace's current life at the nursing home and largely through flashbacks to her time as a Lady's Maid to Hannah, she finally shares her story.    This book was pure pleasure to read and kept my attention through to the last page. Grace was a delightful hostess in the telling of this family's saga and her words so believable, you can't help but have compassion for her.    This novel would make a terrific book club read.  I am looking forward to reading her latest, The Forgotten Garden and any other future works by Ms.   Morton.
B0028K31CE|3.0|It's a slightly different Maxwell.  I was underwhelmed.  That mellow falsetto I first fell in love with, that so characterized Urban Hang Suite and the follow up CDs before this one...it's not gone but it's used very sparingly.  I will listen to this CD over and over until it grows on me because it's not bad.  Just not what I expected after waiting so long.
0441172717|5.0|I am not generally a sci-fi fan. When I was first told of the Dune series, I was a bit hesitant. However, after reading Dune, I was mesmerized by Frank Herbert's desert planet. Herbert takes time to describe the culture, religion, politics, and way of life of the people on Dune. Even the sci-fi aspects of the story are logically explained, so as to make it realistic had such a planet existed. One thing that makes the book very \\"at the edge of the seat\\" exciting is how Herbert lets the reader into the thoughts of each character. The reader is given access into each character's thoughts and motives.   Dune is definitely a book for those who want to be intrigued.     P.S. I am almost finished with the 2nd book, and ready to start the 3rd.
B0029358GM|4.0|Truth is, Jeff Tweedy writes nice folk-roots-pop songs that Nels Cline takes to other places altogether. Less Cline and the formidable powers who comprise the band, Tweedy is a bit like a modern day Richie Furay. That's not a cut, just an indication that his safety resides in these numbers.  That said, there is a lot to commend this record, even if it does argue for an Uncle Tupelo reunion. The opening track is a tongue and cheek amuse bouche to the fan base, but is ennervated by the distortions that Cline brings to the proceedings. That is pretty much the blueprint throughout. To wit, on Letterman on July 14, Wilco performed \\"You and I\\" with Feist (in a cocktail dress that really wasn't working for her) . Feist will remind no one of Mitchell or the McGarrigles, but she delivered a complimentary offset to Tweedy's nasal paean, much as she does on the CD. The camera, wisely, focused on Cline because that's where the nuanced fireworks were on display. That was abundantly clear at last December's concert stop in Philly where Wilco opened for Neil Young. It REALLY was Cline with a backup band and a singer. While this CD is considerably less explosive than that concert date, the strengths are in the subversions and augmentations Cline brings to the songs. Kotche is, as ever, a stalwart drummer who locks the groove for bass, keyboards and guitars with very steady guidance. All in all, you'll find this, on its surface, less sonically edgy than \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" or \\"Ghost\\", but listen to what is happening just below the surface of Tweedy's gossamer tunes.  Well worth a download, this is a CD for the summer.  Now, onto Son Volt!
B001FB4W16|5.0|I never knew about the books but after watching this, I totally got them.  This show is amazing.  I love all the characters.  There is so much mystery that I'm always interested.  It's funny.  Everything is good and solid: writing, acting, directing, effects.  If you ask me, this show is so good, it has ruined most other vampire shows and movies for me because it is so good.  Lost Boys and Interview are still watchable now but that's it.  True Blood has set a new level of excellence.

The exercises were easy to do, and I totally enjoyed Jillian's banter.  She pushes you through a couple circuts of exercise, jumping jacks, dumbell curls, stationary lundges, etc.  YOU CAN DO THIS! She even shows you modifications to help you through some exercises. Exercise doesn't have to take hours a day - just twenty minutes.

After 3 years of what I can only assume was a creative hiatus, Daughtry is back with their sophomore album \\"Leave This Town\\" and please believe they brought their A-game. I dare say they conquered the sophomore curse and exceeded their debut. Simply put: THIS CD IS GREAT! out of the 12 songs on here, I give all of them a 5/5 save for No Surprise which only gets a 4/5 (oddly enough, this is the single). That means you have an entire CD of tracks that you wont likely to skip. Cover to cover, this is quality music. This is alternative rock in top form. An excellent CD, great to add to your collection, even if your not a big rock fan.<br /><br />Top 3 Tracks:<br /><br />You Don't Belong<br />Supernatural<br />September<br /><br />You'll be singing along with Chris all day long.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|There are two discs, featuring material from four concerts in May 2005.  The camera work is excellent, as there are many close-ups of Eric Clapton's fingers as they whiz about the fretboard, close-ups of Jack Bruce, as he sings or puffs into his harmonica, and many images of Jack Bruce, as his sticks navigate their way through his collection of drums and cymbals.  We learn that Eric Clapton is the one with the high voice, and Jack Bruce is the one with the low voice.  Most of the singing is done by Jack Bruce.  From set to set, Mr.Clapton sticks with the same black Fender Strat, while Mr. Bruce changes his bass guitars.  There is no attempt at joking, no attempts at spoofing their own songs, no videos cutting to fashionable events from the 1960s, no funny haircuts, no dancing on stage, and no bun-shaking.  What we find is straight music --  electric blues.      These men keep going and going and going, and never get tired.  Just like the proverbial ENERGIZER BATTERY.  All music-lovers should be grateful that the members of Cream don't suffer from arthritis.    The two compact discs can serve as a teaching aid for budding blues guitarists.  Most or perhaps all of the material played by Mr. Clapton can be copied by a skilled and intelligent high school student, perhaps with the aid of a music teacher.  On the other hand, most people cannot approach the inventiveness of Mr. Clapton's improvised arpeggios.  The sound quality, at least for the lead guitar, is superb.  Every note of Mr.Clapton's guitar is crystal-clear.  (How about an amazon.com review from a drummer?)    I was especially glad for the inclusion of PRESSED RAT AND WARTHOG, a recitative by Mr. Baker, where the bass guitar plays tunes from old English folk songs.  The same tunes can be found on certain compositions by British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.  SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE is distinguished in that, what is tacked on to the end, is a 2-minute jam session where the tempo is double-timed.  We also findTOAD.  Mr.Bruce and Mr.Clapton set down their guitars and leave the stage, when it is Mr.Baker's turn for his lengthy solo in TOAD.    From time to time, the camera discloses groups of people in the crowd.  What was surprising to me is that most of the audience consists of youngsters in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.  It is not clear to me why most of the audience was not in their 60s and 70s.  Perhaps all of these persons were put in the wheelchair-only section, and were not visible to the camera.    At the very end of the second disc, we hear excerpts from an interview, where various members of Cream express gladness at the fact that they were able to overcome any differences, and to collaborate for a harmonious concert at Royal Albert Hall.  These \\"differences\\" are not disclosed to us.  However, as with the life-stories of many \\"celebrities,\\" the consumer is usually better off (or happier) not knowing what has taken place behind the scenes.    In 1968, I saw Cream, during their first American Tour, perform at a little known street-corner cafe in San Francisco called, \\"Filmore Auditoreum.\\"  The two other groups on the bill were Gary Burton Quartet (jazz vibraphone) and the Flaming Groovies.  A year later, I saw Cream again at Oakland Auditoreum, where the warm-up act was It's a Beautiful Day (most known for the song, WHITE BIRD).  FIVE STARS.
B00297FEUS|5.0|Unfortunately I got a bung Disc 1 and am awaiting a replacement, so this review comments on the album rather than the remaster. This was the first album (cassette) I ever bought - together with Kiss's 'Animalize', so it brings back great memories. This album has held up fantastically over the course of time and the rarities disc is a great collection of extras and throwaways that I would have killed for back then. Every song fits like a glove with not a dud amongst them - all killer, no filler. I would have loved to have seen them live at the time. It's interesting to listen to this album against the 'Still Hungry' re-recording of a few years ago and then compare that to the same treatment of 'Ten' by Pearl Jam. 'Still Hungry' was a brilliant job and stands alone as a completely valid recording without dimninishing the original - which completely rocks, production faults and all. An essential addition to any music collection, classic.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|A very enjoyable clean movie to watch. Well developed story within a story with good visuals (color and scenery) and action.  The young girl in the film was perfect - it was refreshing to see her just as you would expect a girl her age to act.  She was afraid to answer questions directly and answered in doublespeak, she thought no one noticed her, and she liked to lick the ice blocks on the ice truck.  Great movie!

0142000671|3.0|Of Mice and Men has by now attained the status of one of those books that we are \\"supposed to read.\\" I finally got around to reading it this summer (2009). OM&M is consistently interesting reading. But it did not move me as much as the best books that I have read.    The best thing that I can say about OM&M is that it is a book that you want to read. John Steinbeck's protagonists, George and Lennie, are so vividly drawn that they \\"come to life\\" for the reader. As a result, I found that I cared about both men's fates and I cheered for them to succeed.     Steinbeck also does a good job of crafting vivid descriptions of the grubby conditions in which George and Lennie live their lives; readers will find it easy to picture the scenes that Steinbeck describes. OM&M contains several strong scenes. The scene in which the men debate whether to shoot Candy's dog is powerful and important to Steinbeck's overall message. The opening scene in which George and Lennie walk down the dusty road toward the ranch also contains many memorable images and some good dialogue.    In other ways, I thought that OM&M was lacking. OM&M is depressingly unsubtle. Steinbeck incessantly hammers away at his themes. For instance, Steinbeck makes the point that Lennie does NOT like to fight so many times that I lost count. Another overworn point is that the men dream of living on land that they own. Steinbeck seems to have worried that his readers were not sufficiently intelligent to draw the conclusions that he wanted them to draw. He attempted to compensate through redundancy.    More damagingly, Steinbeck sets up a simplistic universe in which good, strong workers struggle against heartless bosses. Unlike George and Lennie, the people that they work for are sloppily-drawn caricatures. The fact that Steinbeck describes one character only as \\"Curley's wife\\" provides an idea of the slapdash manner in which Steinbeck draws the \\"villains.\\" I don't want to include a spoiler in my review, but I believethat OM&M would have been more powerful if \\"Curley's wife\\" had been less of a caricature. Had she been even moderately sympathetic, OM&M would challenge its readers to answer more-difficult questions. Steinbeck's immunity to nuance drains the power and realism from OM&M.    Finally, OM&M's last chapter includes a scene in which Lennie has surreal visions. This is a daring tactic. Steinbeck uses it to try to illustrate Lennie's internal struggle. It is only partially successful as it introduces a jarring shift in the perspective Steinbeck uses in the rest of the book. Lennie's visions are interesting, but the manner in which Steinbeck presents the visions makes the reader aware of Steinbeck's overly-heavy hand.    OM&M is a good, quick (118-page) read. But, in my humble opinion, it is no better than good.

B00275EGTC|5.0|Moon has been one of my most anticipated films of the year ever since I saw the trailer a few months ago. Everything about the trailer pulled me in. Sam Rockwell looked to put in an incredible performance, the score sounded incredibly solid and fit the film like a glove, and it just looked like a really amazing sci-fi film. Have you ever walked away from a film completely satisfied? That feeling you have when you see a film that just sticks with you as its most memorable moments play through your head and you smile a little as you walk to your car? That's the feeling that pulsed through me after seeing Moon. A feeling that I've only felt a handful of times (The Dark Knight, Benjamin Button, Up, and Moon come to mind).<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is really in top form here. I've always wanted to like him, but had always seen him in films where it felt like he was holding back and not showing his full potential. Moon definitely corrected that as Rockwell is really able to portray his acting range and how wonderful he really is. When I saw 1408, the first thing that crossed my mind after it ended was that John Cusack really carried that film. It was just him alone in a hotel room the majority of the film and he was able to make that worth watching. What John Cusack is to 1408, Sam Rockwell is to Moon as it's just Sam reacting to himself during the film's duration.<br /><br />It's not often that I get to say a film met my expectations or satisfied me in every way, but Moon did just that. This is Sam Rockwell at his best. The film pulls you in as soon as the opening scene hits with Sam running on a treadmill and that familiar music from the trailer kicks in. My craving for an incredible and original sci-fi film for quite some time was met with this and it delivered in every aspect. This film has a limited release that will surely only be available for a limited time until it hits DVD. If it comes to a theater near you, be sure to see it. It's definitely in the running for my favorite film of the year.of the year.
B0028T6XXY|3.0|I really enjoy Michael Bublé and was so looking foward to the DVD.  I have another DVD of his and it's spectacular -- this one left much to be desired.  It was mostly talking -- interviews with both him and some of his band members.  There was little of his performance, which was a major dissappointment.  Oh, well, maybe the next one. . .
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I actually saw this version first and was moved by the enjoyable acting, dynamic characters, strict attention to detail, dark theme, and the cold yet controlled nature of Kelly's doomed split-off world.    Perhaps one of the best features of this film is its understated attitude toward Donnie's role (and the roles of all the characters for that matter) in restoring the damaged timeline to causal closure.  It's difficult to tell exactly where the story is going and what each event signifies until these roles are revealed, when the plot suddenly comes together and starts rolling, which was (for me) somewhat like a commoner piecing together an ancient prophecy.    I was very much surprised when I subsequently purchased this movie and found that a lot of important information had been cut!  (I didn't realize I had seen the director's cut initially, and had bought the theatrical release).  I actually said out loud \\"how could anyone figure out what this movie is about?\\"  the excerpts from 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' and the references to Watership Down, the doomed family (pumpkin carving), and Donnie's sanity resolution had been totally removed.    Personally, I think the movie is almost wholly ambiguous in meaning without the majority of this removed information, especially the book excerpts.  While this is not a bad thing (the pacing is much better and the wonderful tone of the film is still in tact with the theatrical release) I definitely prefer this version because it's a true science fiction to me, whereas the theatrical version is more of a thriller/introspective.    I certainly don't mean to devalue the original version, it is still amazing by my standards.  I just notice a lot of negative reviews regarding the director's cut and would like to voice some of the positives of this version.
B0013FNC38|3.0|I loved Mraz's first album, and was hoping to be blown away again...but I was disappointed with this one.  His previous work was a delicious variety - some funky songs, but folksy ones, some poppy ones.  This album had a couple of funky, upbeat songs, but most were the same boring acoustic note.  This CD never made it into my regular rotation, and after hearing the one annoying radio hit \\"I'm Yours\\" like a bajillion times, I'm about ready to throw the album out!

Good intentions can be the most hurtful actions a person participates in. A wonderful story of the magic of life and the healing power of a caring, listening ear.

0061767581|1.0|I had hoped to like this book. I grew up in LA and enjoy reading about the environs. However.....this book is not a complete book. It is the first in an installment and is not complete in itself. It leaves you hanging and dissatisfied without warning. To tolerate the amateurish writing and then be left hanging. I really do not care to read the second book in the series if it ever comes out
0767802470|5.0|DAS BOOT:The Director's Cut ( Deluxe Widescreen Presentation)-I love WW11 movies.Especially sub movies.One of my favourite American sub movies is Enemy Below.However,<br />if you really want know what it must have felt like on<br />a WW11 sub then this is the all time best sub movie ever.<br />It says on the front of the box that this movie was digitally redesigned and remixed soundtrack!It's true !!!<br />The picture quality is terrific.I originally saw this movie<br />on tv and it was very grainy.Not so this version.The sound quality allows you to hear every creak that the sub makes.( 5.1 surround sound for either German or English)<br />This version allows you to select either German spoken or<br />English spoken.You also have a choice of subtitles.<br />The disc uses 2 sides and both sides allow the choice<br />of languages and sound selection.<br />I must say however that even though it says widescreen version,it was actually a full screen version.That's fine with me because I prefer full screen as I have a 50\\" tv.<br />Hope this sorts out some of the confusion that some of the<br />reviewers have stated about this and other versions of this movie.
0061122416|4.0|And young Santiago has learned what his is.  At first, he studied to become a priest, but then the desire to travel struck him.  And so, he leaves everything behind to become a shepherd.  But there is something nagging at him: the need to become someone better.  And that's when he gets the recurring dreams.  He must find hidden treasure.  Where is this treasure?  According to a gypsy, it is all the way in Egypt.  Then the boy meets a strange old man, someone who calls himself the King of Salem.  The man tells him to find his treasure in Egypt, and that through this journey he will realize his own Personal Legend.  Strength, faith and determination will get him everything he wants, he just has to believe in himself.<br /><br />The Alchemist is an odd but beautiful story about seeking one's heart and dreams without letting obstacles and laziness stand in our way.  The novel has many great quotes, passages full of wisdom, and it's almost like reading the Bible.  The moral is quite clear -- we and only we are the ones who stop us from fulfilling our destiny.  Things won't come easy, but we must try anyway.  This simple message applies to everyone, and it'll hit close to home.  Paulo Coelho has a way with words.  I remember reading Veronika Decides to Die several years ago and loving it.  What took me so long to read another one of his books?  The man is an international phenomenon, having sold millions and millions of novels worldwide.  I can see why people love him.  The Alchemist is lyrical, lucid and full of that special brand of magic realism that only South American authors could write.  I have only two things to say against it.  One, there are loose ends.  What happened to the Englishman the boy met in the caravan?  He is mentioned in passing when the boy meets the alchemist, but we don't know for sure how he fares in his search.  And speaking of the boy, I know his name is Santiago because his name is mentioned in the beginning.  He is only known as \\"the boy\\" for the rest of the novel.  Other than that, I love this book and will definitely read other stuff by Coelho in the future.the rest of the novel.  Other than that, I love this book and will definitely read other stuff by Coelho in the future.
0061537969|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and fell in love with Enzo, the dog who narrates the story and his owner, Denny.  It was unique to read a book from a dog's perspective and I found it very compelling and it made me think about dogs in a different way. I had a hard time putting this book down.  It's not a lighthearted, happy read but rather gives the reader a lot to think about.    The only downside was a bit too much information about racing, which I'm not into, but it was so much part of the story and used as a metaphor about life that I didn't mind it. I loved reading this book and was sad to have it end.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Do note that 110 minutes of behind the scenes footage are not included in this Blu-ray release (in the DVD ver.). These are compelling portions and I believe necessary for full appreciation of the show, that were omitted. I'm not sure why they were not included but for the price, they should have been in. I have a feeling money-grubbing BBC executives are to blame because the last disk is only half full and plenty of room to include this footage (if added cost for an extra disk was an issue). Attention Blu-ray piraters from China (though I don't buy pirated anything as of now): include this footage in (even if it's SD from the DVD) and show BBC that your products are not inferior copies but superior in fact.

1400063736|5.0|Colum McCann's \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" follows the lives of a group of individuals immediately before and after Philippe Petit walked a tightrope between the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974.  Although the book does not feature Petit as one of its central characters, the lives of all of the main characters intersect with Petit's walk in a key way, creating a neat puzzle around the event.  The book looks at people from all walks of life in NYC in the 1970s--from Bronx hookers to a Park Avenue matron. As the lives of each of these people comes together you wonder who will survive this vicious city, where people and souls seem to be eaten alive.<br /><br />This was the first work I had ever read by McCann, and wow, was I impressed.  McCann is a master storyteller and the way he weaves words together creates such vivid pictures, you feel like you can smell the smoke from the burning Bronx.  While this novel wasn't my typical style--it is much darker and rawer than what I typically read--McCann's literary gifts can only leave a reader in awe.  I did have a few problems with the structure of the novel--the jumping from character to character sometimes felt jumpy and abrupt, but I think this technique was intended to jar the reader--mimicking the realities of life in 1970s New York.  The ending also felt out of place to me.<br /><br />While this is not exactly light summer reading, I would definitely recommend this book to fans of great english literature.  This work has marked McCann as one of the greats of the modern world, and I can't wait to see what else he produces.

B0000TG9E2|5.0|This is a great Disney movie, it is very much ahead of it's times the book by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll was done in 1865 and this movie reminds me of the 60's but not the 1860's I am sure you know what I mean. I love that when they decided to put this movie on DVD that they made the color's even more vibrant then they previously were. It is to this day one of what I think is the best of Disney's Animated movies. I always think of the white rabbit, saying \\"I'm late, I'm late for a very important date.\\" and Alice looking around in intrigue at everything around her after she is down the rabbit hole. If you have not seen this movie then you are truly missing out on a great movie.

B000ETRCMQ|2.0|I thought the acting in this movie was wonderful. It was what I thought it would be but it just did not do anyhting for me. I wasn't impressed with it at all. It was bland in some points and in others I thought it was finally picking up it would go back down. I think it is a wonderful story but it just did not impress me at all. Definatly not a movie I would watch again or refer anyone to.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|Death Magnetic is more of the same in many ways. Although I should note that the newer generation of Metallica fans will probably enjoy this album. You can instantly identify this generation of fan: They refer to the band as 'Tallica' and think their best album is the \\"Black Album\\". As for me, this is really the same old, same old Metallica since that album. Yeah, they finally stopped the sell-out Drop-D tuning and have stretched out the songs by a couple minutes, hell, they even let Hammett record some solos, but that does not make them the old Metallica we last heard on the ...And Justice for All album.  Kirk's solos are incredibly sloppy. Hetfield is still trying to \\"sing\\" and would fit in well with a Lynyrd Skynyrd tribute band.     I knew it was over for Metallica when I saw them Live in concert for the second time. My first Metallica concert was on the \\"Justice\\" tour and they went for the throat and let the music do the talking. Then I saw them on the \\"Black\\" tour and what a difference! Hetfield pandering to the crowd: I walked out when he said the following to the crowd: \\"..so you guys want it harder?!?\\"     The bottom line?  The current Metallica is Hetfield band. I personally miss the Pre-Black version. Obviously, Mustaine and the late Cliff Burton had a influence on the first 4 albums and I miss it.

0385737424|4.0|The epigraph to WHEN YOU REACH ME, a quote by Albert Einstein, is prophetic: \\"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious\\" -- because on the very next page, the novel opens with a Wow! that plunges readers into an intriguing story, the mysteriousness of which is indeed a terrific experience.    It's the story of Miranda's year in sixth grade -- of being suddenly on the outs with Sal (a boy who's been her best friend since birth); of navigating new friendships, new social classes, a homeless guy on the corner, and possibly a new step-father; of helping her mother prepare to be a game-show contestant.    Into this mix comes a series of mysterious notes that intrigue Miranda, and freak her out a little bit -- not only because they come to her out of nowhere and from who-knows-whom, but also because they seem to predict the future. Also in the mix are references to science and science fiction -- both of which add layers to the mystery of the notes.    The world Stead creates in this novel -- a reflective tween's point of view, her friendships and rivalries, her family life and the retro (late `70s) Manhattan setting -- are reminiscent of Louise Fitzhugh's beloved classic, HARRIET THE SPY. There is less emotion in this novel than that one, but the mystery aspect is quite well done, and positively begs a re-read to examine exactly how Stead stitched it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I have loved Willow since it first came out years ago, and have always had a copy of it in my house since it was made available on VHS way back when.  I have recently purchased a DVD, since my daughter loved it as much as I did, and couldn't get enough! As far as being appropriate for family viewing, in my opinion, aside from mild adventure daring and scary evil queens, it's fine as far as language and sexual content. (There is none) Everyone in the family enjoys this movie, even my mother, who usually shys away from movies about fairys and magic. The baby is adorable, and you just fall in love with her and Willow, her ultimate savior. It's a great time you will enjoy for years to come.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Nothing is as it seems here and throughout this movie, based on a masterful story, you are never sure whether Herr Eisenheim has truly developed supernatural powers or whether what he is doing is merely an illusion. Regardless of what may be the case, what he is doing has a tremendous impact and influence upon the minds and lives of people around him - winning the heart of a woman from a higher social class and affecting the life of the son of the emperor.  Not only does he accomplish what those around him would consider impossible for a man of his social standing, but he does it with exquisite elegance.  The movie is such a feast for my eyes, that I've watched it several times.  Edward Norton is fabulous in the role of Herr Eisenheim.
0767834739|4.0|I really wasn't expecting myself to enjoy this movie as much as I did. It was a nice popcorn flick with good action. I found it to be quite entertaining.     I am usually very critical when it comes to movies. My views on movies usually parallels many critics but I found myself thoroughly engaged while watching this.     The first Resident Evil movie surprised me because I was mildy entertained by it but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as this one. Of course if you're expecting an Oscar-worthy blockbuster here you will be disappointed but if you just want some good ol' mindless movie-watching fun, I recommend Resident Evil: Apocolypse. The producers seem as if they really put some effort into making this movie an enjoyable experience and not out for the fast buck. Matter-of-fact, I really wouldn't mind owning this movie.

B0026UV77C|5.0|I loved Placebo's 2006 release \\"Meds\\" and was looking forward to this. For those who liked that album, this is more of the same but with horns featured subtly.<br /><br />The lyrics might be repetitive in places, but they fit in with the feel of the song. Title track \\"Battle of the sun\\" is a perfect example, a slow burning rocker progressing to a grand crescendo with Brian Molko's strangled vocals absolutely soaring towards the end.<br /><br />\\"Ashtray heart\\" is a sunny sing-along, while \\"For what it's worth\\" with its choppy riff wouldn't be out of place on an REM album (especially \\"Monster\\") and features a nice horn section. Taking down the tempo somewhat is \\"Devil in the details\\" with a blistering riff in the chorus. \\"Bright lights' is a pulsing number with chiming guitars, Molko singing in lower register, and affecting lyrics; \\"A heart that hurts, is a heart that works\\". True! Nice and sunny is \\"The never-ending why\\".<br /><br />\\"Julien\\" features a low droning bassline and hushed vocals set to a stomping almost Disco beat, leading to a rocking orchestral second half. Definitely one of the finer moments of this disc.<br /><br />Other standouts include the bouncy \\"Breathe underwater\\" and the trio of ballads \\"Happy you're gone\\" (with an almost lullaby-like first verse and bittersweet lyrics - \\"See me in the eyes of another's child/turn away when you see me walking by\\"), \\"Come undone\\", and the \\"Kings of medicine\\" (with a nice plucked guitar intro, gentle claps, and triumphant sounding horns at the end).<br /><br />Every bit as good as \\"Meds\\"
1401302378|3.0|The facts presented by the author are perfectly valid ... but then he takes them, re-chews them over and over and presents them from 15 different perspectives. Come on, I've got the idea after the first 20 pages, I could use 30 more, but the rest is filler.<br /><br />There are two likely explanations: either the author is so engrossed in his theory that he likes to re-explain it from miriad different angles ... or he doesn't believe in the digital long tail (where his 50-pages PDF would land) and decided to produce a traditional book.
0385737424|5.0|This is a wonderful book that's part SciFi and part Mystery. As a long time avid reader of both types of books, I quickly figured out the twist to the plot, the \\"who done it and how\\" but I didn't care.

B001R7IH1Y|1.0|The Beastie Boys have been holding back the unreleased songs on their recent series of album reissues. I know there is a lot more unreleased material available from this time period that could have easily fit on disc 2 of this set. Where's the original version of \\"Intergalactic\\"?  What about songs like \\"Dejembe\\", \\"The Hurricane Freestyle\\", \\"Triphammer\\", \\"Screaming at a Wall\\" or \\"Conga + Bass\\" from the old Sabotage VHS? Instead we get an underwhelming recording of the Beasties playing basketball... and I'm assuming this counts as one of the 2 unreleased songs that is promised on the album cover? I also have the Paul's Boutique and Check Your Head reissues and they are equally disappointing when it comes to the bonus songs, in fact the former has none. If you already own these albums I wouldn't waste your money on the reissues.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|What can I say? David Cook simply rules. He was far and away the best contestant of his season, and he more than deserved to win American Idol.    That being said, this album is really boring. It starts relatively strong, but by track 8 you'll be wanting to take it out and put something else in... I hate to say it, but it's the truth.    If you enjoyed this album, good for you! I'm not here to say it's an awful album... I just didn't enjoy it.

Not only did this one seriously deviate from the book, it also included a graphic scene of the main    character looking at drawings of a rape (not in the book).

B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Foot of the Mountain has a little bit of 80s and dance sounds to it.  I absolute love what they have done as far as the sounds.  The album sounds very modern, but still with an A-ha identity. I have been listening to A-ha since I was 8 and I have grown to love them more and more in the past two decades.  I have decided that I need to assist with some of the Marketing in the U.S, so I try to let people know they are around and they have great music. It really is sad that America is unaware of the great sounds of A-ha.  Please don't hesitate, this is a great album to have!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD is about 30 minutes for one workout.  There are three 20-minute workouts on the DVD; however, by the time you add the warmup and cooldown, plus beginning stuff you can't skip through, expect to spend about 30 minutes on one workout.    When I first got this DVD, I was happy and psyched.  Awesome...I'm going to get into great shape with this, I thought.  Yes, I'm sure if I continue using this DVD, I'll get into great shape; however, I'm not willing to pay the price in daily pain.  I prefer my workouts to be effective, but not feel like torture!  I was extremely dedicated at first with the idea that I would get through the entire 30 days.  By the time I got to Day 7, I decided I couldn't take it any more.  I excercise regularly, am 35 years old, and used to be very active in dance.    However, as I've gotten older, I've realized that my joints can no longer handle the high impact excercises that I used to do.  I used to jump and bounce around a lot; however, I now have joint problems due to all of the hard physical activity I put my body through when I was younger.      This DVD features circuit training in which you do a few minutes of cardio, then strength, then abs.  I used to be able to do that.  Now, it's just too much stress for my body.  If you don't have any problems with your joints and can handle high impact exercise, this is a great DVD for you.    However, if you need something lower impact, yet still very effective, I would recommend going with something like the Leslie Sansone Walk at Home DVDs.

1402770006|4.0|I have always thought that the Sherlock Holmes stories should make good graphic novels, and that The Hound, the best of all the stories, should make a particularly good one. While there have been several attempts, as far as I know, this is the only oustanding success. The graphics follow a \\"cinematic\\" approach which is very effective, and the story is quite faithful to the Novel, unlike some adaptations (not to mention the gripping, but over-the-top Lee/Cushing Hammer film version).
1844138518|4.0|The Long Tail addresses the fact that the internet enables retailers to address many different market niches, geographic regions, preferences for shopping and purchasing, etc. It also quantifies the value of the products/markets appealing to the less-than-blockbuster niches which is compelling. The take-away for small and medium businesses is that you needn't have the next Twitter, Facebook, or Power Ranger with the Kung Fu grip to have a very successful presence online. In fact, appealing to markets that are not served well by the Amazon's of the world can payoff in spades as long as you focus on satisfying their needs with laser-like focus. This book is a good read for small and medium business owners and managers since they are more likely to satisfy more narrow markets and niches. [...]

B000LXH0AE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It reminds me a lot of when Adam Sandlar did Spanglish - funny, cute, but with a good message.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighthearted movies, this is perfect.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|Warner Bros. delayed film version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ...it was worth the wait. J.K.Rowling's young wizard enters into his last full year of attending Hogwarts...I initially described the Half-Blood Prince novel as having a distinct post-911 feel to it...as does it's film counterpart...the Dark Lord is back to full strength (as seen in his battle with Dumbledore at the climax of \\"Order of the Phoenix\\"), the wizarding world is now privy to the knowledge of this return and it is a very different place, than it was when we first met Harry back in the Sorcerer's Stone. There is an gloomy atmosphere of fear and foreboding evident even in the brief moments we see of the Muggle's perspective, in an early scene in which Harry reads of disasters impacting both worlds. Even the familiar Diagon Alley is ...well unfamiliar, shopkeepers packed and gone or worst , as we see wandmaker Ollivander abducted following the destruction of his shop ....the only wand casting \\"lumos\\" on this darkened new world the Weasley twins Joke shop, alas, all too brief. New concepts, like apparitions, Felix Felicis and Horcruxes are introduced and old ones like the memory exposition vehicle of the pensive return to great effect. Also returning is the Director of \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" David Yates who does a fine job giving the material a real world connection opening with attacks in London. Yates focuses on more matters of heart than any Potter film to date, not just the love potions and love interests. But, Harry and Dumbledore's connection, the bonds of family via the Weasleys, Draco's angst-filled moments all come alive. Yates' vision of Quidditch is the finest yet seen, here the wizard sport really feels like, well, a sport...bone crunching blocks and offensive plays! Great comedic moments, with Ron especially, truly scary moments with Voldemort's undead guardians and the curse-attack Katie Bell, made my hair stand on end (and her's). This is the most adult outing yet for the francise, not just the boy/girl issues of adolescent, but the cast has never been more comfortable in their roles...Ginny sure has come along way...and go re-watch the young neophyte Harry in Sorcerer's Stone if you doubt that.<br /><br />Like many of the Potter stories/film this one contains it's share of exposition and flashback, but like it's predecessors , unique methods of delivering these \\"flashbacks\\" are used...this time we get the origin of the Dark Lord Voldemort via Dumbledore's visit to an orphanage to meet his future Nemesis. In addition to this, other answers are given as to how Tom Riddle became the seemingly immortal \\"He who must not be named\\" and what Harry must do to face him....the beginning of Harry's quest to defeat Voldemort. In addition to this, attacks on students begin and Hogwarts is (again) unsafe, but who is the real target...who is this assassin?. Meanwhile, love is in the air and candies, as Harry only belatedly realizes his would be truelove,...and Ron is still a mess, only this time with imbibed love potion.<br /><br />Fortunately for the filmmakers ...the cast of the series has aged well and each has grown up to be attractive or at least interesting-looking (Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint),recasting would have be unfortunate, so we don't really need to suspend disbelief to the level of say Frankie and Annette in a Beach flick, everyone young enough for the big screen vision of the books. Among the returning cast is Tom Felton a Harry's school nemesis Draco Malfoy, given so much more to work with in this one Felton is growing worthy of the adult veterans he shares scenes with (namely Alan Rickman terrifically cast as Prof. Snape)... Dumbledore is again Michael Gambon, who replace the late great Richard Harris, Gambon is much better in this feature than in previous films, but I feel the emotional content greatly diminished by his presence instead of his predecessor, Evanna Lynch again makes with the scene stealing as Luna Lovegood (who replaces the Tonks character for early scenes, to greater effect than the original text), Bellatrix Lestrange  played so wonderfully wicked by Helena Bonham Carter that a completely original  sequence is added at the Burrow.. as some old roles are expanded others are reduced, like scenes with Draco's sidekicks Crabbe & Goyle as little girls, most unfortunately Neville Longbottom has maybe one line...considering his importance to the final moments of the final installment I fear even this will be cut....absent entirely are Harry's horrible non-wizard kin the Dursleys (shame to as the scene with Dumbledore berating their abuse would have been great to see come to screen). New to the series Jim Broadbent's DELIGHTFUL Professor Slughorn this installment's obligatory new teacher to Hogwarts, also new and satisfyingly chilling to watch is Hero Fienn Tiffin as an 11-year-old Tom Riddle in a flashbacks, who is the real nephew of Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult Voldemort, who is absent from \\"Half-blood Prince\\" physically, but he's presence surely has weight that is felt in nearly every scene as Dumbledore preps Harry for his final battle with the Dark Lord. Lines about Harry's blood being more precious than his own, really take this notion home.<br /><br />Overall: \\"HALF-BLOOD\\" is a way, WAAY abridged and jazzed up Hollywood version of the book for the screen....in many ways better than any of the series to date. The perfect balance of comedy, horror and action that makes the HP films successful...so to the cast and crew I say \\"Mischief managed!\\"<br /><br />If you have read the book and want to know what was cut and what wasn't......OTHERWISE DON'T READ ON ....SPOILERS BELOW...<br /><br />The Other Minister and recap of over 5 years of book exposition and  intro to the new Minister of Magic Scrimgeour replaces Fudge...yep it was cut.<br /><br />Snape Takes the Unbreakable oath to protect Draco on his mission for the Dark Lord...the unedited version is another 5 year (plus) explanation of why he didn't kill Harry and why he is still Voldemort's most faithful servant....this is edited, but kept.<br /><br />Harry & the Dursley's ....Dumbledore's visit to Privot Drive...exposition on Harry as heir to his Godfather's estate/ the Order's HQ and house elf  Kreacher (who's important to the 7th Book)....also cut, replaced with \\"Harry at a Diner flirting with a waitress\\"...strange.<br /><br />Harry and Dumbledore's stop over recruitment of Slughorn, is interesting for revealing the atmosphere in the wizarding world as they find the would be Professor hiding out, fearing for his life. I figured this would be cut....but they kept it...rounding out Slughorn nicely.<br /><br />Things go a lot faster after reaching the Burrow...Wedding subplot? No. Lots less Tonks and no Fleur, thankfully...added at the Burrow is a Xmas action sequence...instead of Harry's confrontation with the new Minister, makes sense, but sort of eliminates the need for the Wedding attack in HP7, or a wedding at all without Bill or Fleur.<br /><br />Trip to Diagon Alley still includes Joke Shop (didn't seeU-NO-POO?), like a mentioned before, and Malfoy is tailed without any confrontation as clues to his destiny are given in Knockturn Alley..<br /><br />Trouble on the Hogwarts express is kept, while the Slughorn \\"meet and greet\\" is altered.<br />Tonks is cut and swapped out for Luna, which I like better, the Tonks / Lupin stuff in the book seems too contrived, even more so than Harry.<br /><br />Harry gets his used Textbook, care of the Half-Blood Prince load with tips, ...becomes a potion expert, but the Prince's Levicorpus spell does not appear the film (odd cause it is in the tie-in game), Sectumsempra is as we see when Harry fights Draco again, hides the book, with help from Ginny as a vehicle for their moment alone...<br /><br />Harry and Dumbledore's private lessons and flashbacks happen minus the story of Voldemort's mother? Both versions ofSlughorn's memory, too.<br /><br />Aragog's funeral is included, while Harry is on \\"Luck\\" but the closing Funeral of the story isn't included...we do see poor ole Fawkes, fly off into the setting sun.tion of why he didn't kill Harry and why he is still Voldemort's most faithful servant....this is edited, but kept.    Harry & the Dursley's ....Dumbledore's visit to Privot Drive...exposition on Harry as heir to his Godfather's estate/ the Order's HQ and house elf  Kreacher (who's important to the 7th Book)....also cut, replaced with \\"Harry at a Diner flirting with a waitress\\"...strange.    Harry and Dumbledore's stop over recruitment of Slughorn, is interesting for revealing the atmosphere in the wizarding world as they find the would be Professor hiding out, fearing for his life. I figured this would be cut....but they kept it...rounding out Slughorn nicely.     Things go a lot faster after reaching the Burrow...Wedding subplot?

Trip to Diagon Alley still includes Joke Shop (didn't seeU-NO-POO?), like a mentioned before, and Malfoy is tailed without any confrontation as clues to his destiny are given in Knockturn Alley..    Trouble on the Hogwarts express is kept, while the Slughorn \\"meet and greet\\" is altered.  Tonks is cut and swapped out for Luna, which I like better, the Tonks / Lupin stuff in the book seems too contrived, even more so than Harry.

044024367X|5.0|Way more reviews here than make sense deriding this book. After hesitating to read this (who wants to be disappointed by their hero?) I dug in and downloaded it onto the Kindle. While it isn't Lee Child's best, it certainly doesn't rate the dismal reviews of those who appear more to have a problem with political opinion and religious diversity than anything else.
B000M3452Y|4.0|this is a great album, drawing its influences from places as diverse as late-70s punk (North American Scum), shriekback (Us vs. Them), and electronic dance music of the 90's.  It manages to pay tribute, but in a fresh way without taking itself seriously.  Great party soundtrack.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I had virtually zero expectations for this series when it was first announced.  It was being produced by many of the same people associated with XENA and HERCULES and I assumed that the production values would be similar to those two shows.  On the other hand, after a slow start XENA became increasingly enjoyable thanks to a blend of self-parody and Lucy Lawless's wide-ranged excellence as an actress.  Plus, I was in the mood for a LOTR style fantasy series.  I had read the first novel in the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind (who was involved with the creation of this new series) and liked it OK (Tolkein-style fantasy is one of my least favorite genre of literature), so I decided to give this series a shot.  My daughter, who is a big fan of the fantasy genre, shared my dubiousness about LEGEND OF THE SEEKER.<br /><br />We were both surprised!  Now, LEGEND OF THE SEEKER is not a great show.  What is amazing is that it is not in any way a bad one.  It is simply plain and decent escapist entertainment.  It started off decently and then got better as it went along.  Initially I was afraid that it was going to be purely episodic, which would have been unfortunate given that its source material was a novel.  But luckily as the season went on the show embraced more and more serial elements.  By the end of the season it was a show that I was looking forward to each Saturday afternoon (except when bumped by the Cubs -- let me just throw out here that I was formerly a huge baseball fan, but ever since learning about Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, A-Roid, Sammy Sosa, Roger Clemens, and others and their involvement with performance enhancing drugs, I simply can't stand to look at a baseball game).  The first season roughly tracked with the first novel in Goodkind's immense series, and did so in very polished fashion, in a show with high production standards and none of the self-parody that marked both XENA and HERCULES.  Because of that lack of camp and self-mocking, I'm not sure it has the potential to be the cult show that both of those became, but in many ways it is a more competently produced series.<br /><br />One other reason that LOTS may not become the cult show that the two previous Renaissance productions became is the weakness of the main character.  Whatever vices or virtues of XENA and HERCULES, Kevin Sorbo and especially Lucy Lawless were charismatic lead characters.  Sorbo seemed always to his tongue tucked firmly inside his cheek, while Lawless's virtuosity (equally at ease with action, drama, farce, impersonation [Bruce Campbell tells of one of his book signings being interrupted by an annoying woman who turned out to be Lucy Lawless in disguise], and song, Lawless brought a range of possibilities to her role that Sorbo, who while likeable was nonetheless pretty one-dimensional, was not capable of).  Unfortunately, Craig Horner, who plays Richard Cypher, the Seeker of the title, simply does not have the kind of screen presence that they had.  Moreover, he is a tad too small for the role, in my opinion.  Some publicity sites list him as 6'2, but he looks no taller than his costar, Bridget Regan, who is usually listed as 5'8.  I would guess him to be around 5'9 and very slender.  This is all exacerbated by playing alongside the extremely tall Bruce Spence, who is usually listed around 6'7.  For my money, Horner is the weak link in the cast (and for what it is worth, my daughter agrees with me), simply lacking in the physical stature needed for the role.  But you simply couldn't ask for more in Horner's two costars.  American actress Bridget Regan (her costars have acted primarily in Australia, though Bruce Spence was born in New Zealand) is absolutely perfect as the Confessor and Richard's love interest Kahlan.  Both entrancingly beautiful and an exceptionally fine actress, Regan is simply the best thing on LOTS.  And while Horner lacks physical presence in his heroic scenes, he and Regan make a fine team together.  Alsodoing a wonderful job on the show is the towering Bruce Spence.  First and foremost Spence for me will always be the Gyro Pilot from the Mad Max movies (especially MAD MAD 2, known in the U.S. as THE ROAD WARRIOR).  His scenes were among the best in that film.  But his work here as the wizard of the first order Zeddicus is outstanding and he is magical (no pun intended) in almost every scene he is in.  Though I think Horner somewhat weak as the show's lead, as a group the three leads make a strong team.<br /><br />There are two things that I find especially interesting about LOTS.  First of all, it is a syndicated series, a show that was put into production and then sold to various markets around the world.  In Chicago, where I live, the show is shown on WGN, which is part of many cable TV packages around the U.S.  I have no idea what kinds of local markets have picked up the show.  Not many shows are currently syndicated, though both XENA and HERCULES were, and there have been a number of first-run syndicated shows in the past.  I would like to see more series attempt this.  I frankly do not understand all the factors that go into first-run syndication, but with the four major networks in the U.S. increasingly canceling shows after what they perceive to be weak ratings, I would like to see if it would keep more shows alive.  XENA was never a very highly rated show in the United States, but it was one of the highest rated shows in the world due to its performance internationally.  The second aspect of the show that I find interesting is that it is part of a relatively new trend of TV shows being based upon novels.  Last year TRUE BLOOD became a huge hit (at least in terms of cable, where three million viewers is considered remarkable) for HBO, a series based upon what was originally known as The Southern Vampire Mysteries (later changed to The Sookie Stackhouse Novels) by Arkansas novelist Charlaine Harris.  This next year FLASHFORWARD will be unveiled as a new series for ABC, based upon the Robert Sawyer novel of the same name.  AMC is considering taking to series RED MARS, based upon the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, while ABC has ordered a pilot (interestingly, filmed in New Zealand like LOTS) of Bill Willingham's extraordinary series of graphic novels FABLES.  Obviously, networks seem to be in the mood to take on series based upon ongoing literary sources (though Sawyer's book was a standalone).  I welcome this, especially given that networks want to make shows more and more episodic, while serious fans of shows prefer serials.  Series like the Sookie Stackhouse books or Terry Goodkind's series pretty much demand an ongoing serial format.<br /><br />This is not a great series like MAD MEN or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  It breaks no new ground and is doing nothing to redefine what can be done on television.  But if you want a good old-fashioned yarn, you can do a lot worse than this.  I should add that the BBC did their own sword and sorcery series, MERLIN, which I tried out because one of the stars was BUFFY's Anthony Stewart Head (the watcher Giles).  Before seeing either I thought that MERLIN would be the better of the two shows and that LOTS would be the weaker.  The opposite is true.  I found MERLIN to be pretty much close to unwatchable, while LOTS was an unexpected delight.

B00284BMBM|5.0|Daughtry's sophmore album is just as solid and spectactular as his first.  Great mix of rocking and slower mid-tempo songs showcasing Daughtry's incredible range.  Those who loved the first album will definitely love this one as well.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Fast shipping! Great classic movies. A great bargain for the price and all the dvds.
B00000J7SS|5.0|There are many beatiful reviews here, so im just going to add a little bit of my own feelings twds this piece.<br /><br />  Good music stands out whether you want it or not. That said, i think that people in the Western World tend to prefer melody to when there is a lack of it. Bitches Brew is full of melody of a very unusual kind. The one born from a mixture of free jazz, sheer spontaneity, and careful arrangement and direction.<br />  Although there is such a classification as Miles' \\"electric period\\", in reality its all different stuff, album by album - very different. If you compare this to say \\"Live at the Fillmore\\". Man! That's a whole different world. Well, then let's check it out for what it is and dig this masterpiece! Yeh!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This show hits you with its unique brand of humor from the first second and just keeps running.  Hugh Laurie is perfect as Bertie Wooster, a young man of the idle rich, who's sole occupation seems to be entangling his own social life.  To this enters Stephen Fry as Mr. Wooster's \\"Gentleman's personal gentleman\\" Jeeves; acting the part of the quintessential valet to a tee.  Jeeves uses his encyclopedic knowledge on nearly every subject to pull off the most complicated and convoluted plans possible to extricated Bertie from his jams; including Bertie's annoying habit of accidentally getting himself engaged.  All the while Jeeves manages to to set Bertie right in his sly and subtle way when he makes his most aggrievance mistakes, such as buying a white hat or monogrammed handkerchiefs.  This series is one of the best shows I've seen in years and stands up favorably to any others I can think of.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|Love this series.  Wodehouse has always been a favorite of mine.  Such fun for \\"House\\" fans.  Watch an episode of House then an episode of Jeeves & Wooster, such a contrast.  Hugh Laurie is nothing short of GREAT.    Irene Dockery
B000FP2OPY|3.0|I originally watched the first several episodes of SUPERNATURAL when it first came on, was not very impressed, and stopped watching. For reasons I won't go into, I decided to watch the first three seasons on DVD (and probably Season Four when it comes out on DVD in September). Rewatching the episodes of Season One that I had already seen and then watching the rest of the season really hasn't altered my assessment of the show. I like the two leads on the show and think they are fine, strong main characters. But that is pretty close to all that I can say good about the show. All in all, I think that this is a show that is limited by its rather strict adherence to its genre, it's close to near faithfulness to the standalone format, and its unwillingness to try new, bold things. I'll say more of this below. While I think there is more wrong with the show than there are things right about it, let me start off by saying what is right<br /><br />I think SUPERNATURAL's greatest strength are Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Dean and Sam Winchester. I think most of the show's success with its group of fans has been based on the interplay between these two. They have great interpersonal chemistry and pretty much carry the show on their two shoulders. Some shows can work with less than ideal leads, but luckily SUPERNATURAL doesn't have that problem. The show's other great strength is the very high production values. The special effects are always superb and they do a great job of maintaining the fantasy. The show always has a great look with great art direction and make up. I've been a fan of a lot of Vancouver-based shows so watching this is a lot of fun for me because it is fun seeing locations used in countless other shows, not to mention the large stable of local Canadian actors. You can do a lot list of actors who have also been on SMALLVILLE or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA or DARK ANGEL or JAKE 2.0 or THE 4400 or KYLE XY or EUREKA or what have you.<br /><br />As I watched Season One of SUPERNATURAL, I kept thinking of another show dealing with the supernatural, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. For whatever reason, TV critics (as opposed to its cult fans) have not found much fondness for SUPERNATURAL, in contrast to BUFFY, which was both a critics' darling and the most heavily studied show by academics in TV history. Why did one show dealing with the supernatural generate an immense amount of serious and in depth reflection, while this new one has not? Asked another way, although SUPERNATURAL has gained a substantial number of fans, definitely qualifying it as a cult show, why has it failed to gain even a small portion of the respect that BUFFY has enjoyed. In answering these questions, one gets to the heart of why I watch TV to begin with. Although I'm a huge fan of BUFFY, I'm not especially a fan of shows dealing with the supernatural. It isn't enough for me that a show deal decently with a certain kind of subject matter; the show has to be good regardless of its genre.<br /><br />BUFFY was a highly subversive show, mixing several genres and creating one of its own (BUFFY is usually credited with being the first Dramedy). Blending fantasy, comedy, drama, teen soap opera, and horror, it stretched all of those genres (not to mention recreating what it was possible to do on TV with very long story arcs), BUFFY was a truly revolutionary show, not to mention a brilliantly written one. BUFFY constantly shocked and surprised, always transcending one's expectations. In contrast - and this gets at the heart both of why I have had trouble truly enjoying SUPERNATURAL and why I think it has failed to garner any critical acclaim - SUPERNATURAL stays completing and safely within the confines of the fantasy/horror genre. It doesn't attempt to redefine what you can do with those genres and it doesn't push against the limitations of the genre. It is a safe, conservative show. And as such it is hard to see it exerting any influence on subsequent series. At theend of Season One I can honestly say that the show had not surprised or challenged me a single time.<br /><br />Closely connected to all this is the weakness of the writing. This comes out in a number of ways, such as the over simplicity of the narrative. In virtually every episode, the storytelling holds up only if you don't examine it very closely. There are dozens of questions that you can pose in any episode that they writers just slough over. There are all kinds of leaps of logic and fact and essential steps that are simply skipped. Let me give one example, pretty much at logic. In one episode a number of individuals have been killed by a killer truck, the reincarnation of another truck that had been deposited in a lake. A few minutes after expressing the need to look at this truck, we see them pulling the truck out of the lake. Questions the writers hope we won't ask: (1) Where did they get the tractor at such notice? (2) How did they learn to operate a tractor? (3) How did they locate the truck so quickly? (4) How did they attach the chain (and how did the chain manage to be long enough) without any apparent diving equipment? OK, all TV story telling requires occasional short cutting. Example: In BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Lee Adama gained a great deal of weight during the period when he was in charge of Pegasus while the humans were living on New Caprica. After the escape from New Caprica Lee remains very overweight for an episode, but then actor Jamie Bamber suddenly shed his fat suit and became the lean ripped person he had been before. Why? Creator Ron Moore says that they did this because watching Lee lose weight like that for half the season would be boring. He miraculously lost the weight because it led to better storytelling. It was a shortcut, but a shortcut for the greater good of the show. Now, one could argue that the endless shortcuts they take on each episode of SUPERNATURAL are shortcuts of the same kind. I could buy that if they were rare rather than commonplace. When shortcuts become as prevalent as they are on SUPERNATURAL, it is almost a mission statement. It is as if they've decided to ignore cogent, intelligent storytelling.<br /><br />The weakness of the writing also comes out in the simplistic way each story is told. We see a monster or demon and we pretty much instantly know what they are going to do. They kill their victims. There is a consistent linearity about this. We see a person. We see a demon/monster/possessed person. We see a death. For a show dealing with the supernatural, there is a shocking like of surprise on the show. The show almost always goes to the obvious. Contrast this with a show like FRINGE, where you can usually eliminate the most obvious solution.<br /><br />If you don't have a special affinity toward fantasy and horror, it isn't probable that you will like this show. If you do love the genre, this is likely to be something you will enjoy. I am neither especially interested in nor particularly repulsed by the genre. A show has to win me on its own merits. So I've found the show to be mildly entertaining, and I might even continue to watch it next year when it returns. But then again, I might not.can honestly say that the show had not surprised or challenged me a single time.     Closely connected to all this is the weakness of the writing.

We see a monster or demon and we pretty much instantly know what they are going to do. They kill their victims. There is a consistent linearity about this. We see a person. We see a demon/monster/possessed person. We see a death. For a show dealing with the supernatural, there is a shocking like of surprise on the show. The show almost always goes to the obvious. Contrast this with a show like FRINGE, where you can usually eliminate the most obvious solution.     If you don't have a special affinity toward fantasy and horror, it isn't probable that you will like this show. If you do love the genre, this is likely to be something you will enjoy. I am neither especially interested in nor particularly repulsed by the genre. A show has to win me on its own merits. So I've found the show to be mildly entertaining, and I might even continue to watch it next year when it returns. But then again, I might not.

0517548232|5.0|I love this book. I got it from the library and figured I'd slog through it because I had heard so many good things about it. It far exceeded my expectations.    Hazlitt explains the main concepts of economics, the common fallacies, and how to think using the big picture to remedy these. He teaches you the simple law in a way everyone over the age of 12 should be able to grasp. He applies it to numerous topics, confronts the typical counter-claim, and consistently shows how it doesn't hold up. He uses historical and simple, sometimes even fun examples.    He simply applies the laws of supply and demand on large scale while showing how ANY interference with these only works against production, which is a setback in any case. Unions, unemployment, price ceilings, price floors, protectionist tariffs, etc. are covered, as are many other topics.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I can finally give away my old Star Trek movie sets.  This Blu-Ray edition is superb in every aspect except for one:  \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\" is, I think, inferior to the previous DVD version so far as the picture.  It looks like too much editing was done and ended up with color over-saturation.  Guess I'll keep the DVD version of that one.  And, for the first time, I can actually \\"see\\" \\"The Final Frontier.\\"  The 7.1 audio is great, too; finally, I'm able to use that feature of my A/V equipment!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It's difficult to put in words the thrill that we as a family experienced when we saw these DVD's (we haven't seen them all because we use these as 'special treats').    The photography is very sweeping and it's a relief to realize that 'such places still exist' on the Earth. David Attenborough's style of narration is very easy on the ears and he brings the series alive. It's good to watch this on the largest screen possible.     The \\"Diaries\\" which come after each episode are a delight (these are missing in the HD/Bluray versions is what some reviewers have mentioned, that's a shame)     These have just been released in India and I was happy with the price too ($ 28). Needless to say, they are worth far, far more.    I probably sound over enthusiastic but it is that kind of a product really.

B001DJLCPE|4.0|I bought this Blu-Ray version of Dr. Strangelove even though I knew it had been altered.  I believe that all classic films should be maintained in their original form, especially this one.  The director left the film in various aspect ratios to complete his vision and cutting off part of the picture is tantamount to cutting off part of a Remington painting to make it fit in a square frame.  That said, I did want to see this movie in high-def, and it still lives up to its original appeal.  The release of movies like this one should come with two versions - the widescreen for those who don't care about the art, and the original aspect ratio for the rest of us.
0767803434|4.0|This is a stunning movie.  It has enough action to hold a guy's interest and enough story line to hold a woman's.  Making it a great date night movie.  And the story is clean enough that if the kids walk in it is ok too.
B00008976Y|5.0|This movie was panned and trivialized when it came out and Kieslowski was trivialized as being a arty filmmaker without art.  I even debated whether I should go see it.  When I did, I loved it!  I was glad I went and didn't pay so much attention to movie critics.  Later as White and Red received better and better reviews, Kieslowski was more respected and when he died, critics loved him.  Juliette Binoche is terrific in the movie Blue which is named after the color of the French flag and stands for liberty.  Julie is \\"liberated\\" suddenly from family ties by a tragic accident which kills her family.  She tries to cut all ties but her attachment to people continues.  While her husband was a great composer hired to write music for the coming of the European Union, it comes to light that she might have been writing for him with his composing partner whom she was having an affair.  Is it true or merely rumor?  Will it be helpful for France to stay alone in the world or join the European Union?  Europe and Julie on the edge of a new slightly scary relationship.

0385339607|5.0|This novel, like The Firm, is perfect vacation reading. Grisham is a quality writer who knows how to tell a story.

B00006G8K0|5.0|I first saw the Horror of Dracula in 1958 when it opened in New York at the old LUXOR Theater in the Bronx. The movie was very well received by many horror film fans including myself and the addition of wide screen color literally added to the scope of this Dracula remake by Hammer films. Note, this film is also available in DVD form in many collections.<br /><br />The scenes which I found particularly frightening showed Chris Lee as the count in close quarters, fangs clearly visible, eyes red and blood shot and obviously in no mood to be trifled with. Peter Cushing was very good as Von Helsing destroying the count in the greatest decomposition scene ever filmed. I think the light in the counts eyes can actually be observed to wink out when he was overtaken by events.<br /><br />The act of suddenly running towards the windows on the long table to pull down the curtains covering the sun, as well as the crossing of the silver candle sticks to fashion a cross was a stroke of genius and very well staged for Peter Cushing and the big screen. One negative comment, Hammer films almost never featured a decent musical score. Conversely, the scores included in Universal horror films were almost always magnificent and really enhanced their movie products.

B0002KVULG|4.0|Dracula (1979) was a perfectly good flick that I rate at three to four stars. It didn't really add too much to the Dracula legend visually or metaphorically and was just a nice remake. Frank Langella did a good job with the role of the count and added what he could with his own interesting acting style and movements. There were some nice camera shots, some nice cuts from the count to a flying bat, the count becoming a wolf while going through the window and a vampire bat whose wings were singed by the sunlight. Overall, this was only a four star remake which appeared a bit underexposed during the many night shots. I did enjoy the musical score. The sequence filmed in the cemetery with Laurence Oliver as Van Helsing and his daughter Lucy was new and interesting and I thought well portrayed.
0060853972|4.0|Yet another book that was initially offered with a Kindle edition but whose Kindle edition has since gone poof! and disappeared.... I should have bought it in Barnes and Noble when I saw it, but had decided to wait until I got home to buy it on my Kindle2. This is more a review of Amazon. As for the book, it has fantastic, glowing reviews all over the place, and the sample I had downloaded sucked me right in...
B0024DF9MU|2.0|Watched it once.  Wanted my hour and a half back.  Watched it a second time.  Hated myself for my stupidity.  You might laugh a little bit, but really it's just an annoying girl, a crappy guy, and a cute story about a couple that end up transcending social mores and agree to just love each other once the woman stops worrying about tradition too much. Oh but wait, the guy eventually caves.  Nevermind, nothing redeeming about this movie.
B001GCUER0|5.0|The packaging of this set is clever!  A single slip for 50 cents off for a bleach to remove a lipstick stain from a white shirt.  Simple advertising at it's best.  The set arrives in a box with transparent lid, like a dress shirt box, and both the first season and second season series will fit in this.  Can't wait for the third season to begin on August 16th.  And thank you, Amazon for the $7.50 saved on the pre-order.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula was an excellent five star film made in 1992.  As far as I am concerned this remake added much to the Dracula legend in many larger than life ways and could only have been produced as such in the late 20th century by taking advantage of state of the art movie magic.<br /><br />The new interpretations of the forms of the shape shifting count were magnificent as were the make up, CGI and all special effects. Dracula was played with a classic but fresh style as was Dr. Van Helsing who was played by the one and only Anthony Hopkins.  The film also had a beautiful musical score which added much to the movie.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I generally don't like to rate anything five stars because I feel like there's always some room for improvement and a product is never really perfect.  While I wouldn't call the Zoom H4n perfect, I think it set out to be something and achieved it fantastically.  It exceeded my expectations, especially for the price, and I use it any chance I can get.<br /><br />I'll start with something trivial...but not really.  It records to SD/SDHC media.  If you have something like the M-Audio MicroTrack II, you're stuck with Compact Flash.  For an audio recorder there's really no need for larger and/or faster cards.  SD/SDHC is larger and fast enough and it's tiny.  Most laptops and desktops these days have SD/SDHC slots in them and I love any chance I get to leave the USB cable at home.<br /><br />But on to more important things...<br /><br />One of the wonderful upgrades in the H4n is that there is a mic level switch on the right side of the device.  Previously this was achieved through a menu.  But the new preamps in the H4n are really what make it a better device than its predecessors.  The recording quality you get from the built-in mics alone is impressive, but when you hook up a nice microphone to the H4n it sounds just too good for a portable recorder.  You can plug in XLR or 1/4\\" inputs as well.  There is a lot I could talk about in regards to the versatility of this device but I'll only mention one other thing in the interest of keeping this relatively short.  One feature I find really compelling, being that I travel a lot and it saves some room in my suitcase, is that you can use the H4n as an audio interface with your computer rather than just a stand-alone portable recorder.  Most of the music I make utilizes sampled or synthesized instruments, and so I'm generally only recording vocals (with the exception of acoustic guitars).  This makes it very easy to grab vocals just about anywhere with Cubase and my laptop.  Zoom includes a free copy of Cubase LE but it works just fine with regular versions of Cubase.<br /><br />Battery life is decent.  It's certainly as good or better than anything else, but it's still less than I'd hope for.  I does use AAs so you can just replace the batteries as needed, or use rechargeable batteries.  I use those rechargeable batteries with the USB port as much as I can and those work quite well.  Standard AAs tend to last for about a ten hour work day of use (that's been my experience, anyway).  The battery life is definitely sufficient, but it's not impressive.<br /><br />The zoom comes with a number of recording settings, allowing you to select various levels of quality in your WAV and MP3 files.  If you're willing to bring your sampling rate to 44.1 Khz and your bit rate to 16, you'll be able to turn on a power efficiency mode that'll increase the battery life significantly.  So, if you need to get that extra power out of your batteries, the H4n offers an option.  While it won't always work for everyone, I think it's a nice addition.<br /><br />A downside of the device, for some, may be the size.  I definitely like the pocket-size of the M-Audio MicroTrack/MicroTrack II, but zoom definitely achieves a much higher level of quality (the important thing) and so I think the increased size is worth it.  It's ultimately necessary for the XLR inputs anyhow.  Still, this is not something you're going to put in your pocket.  A cargo pocket, maybe, but not a regular pocket.  I don't really care, but it is a fairly large device for a portable so that may be worth noting for some.<br /><br />The H4n comes with a bunch of accessories.  You get a screw in stick for holding or, I assume, placing in a microphone stand (it looks like the base of a microphone).  You get a case, a 1GB SD card (which is often sufficient), a power adapter, a wind screen for the stereo mics, a USB cable and probably some other things I'm forgetting.  My point is that they give you pretty much everything you need to get started out ofthe box, except for the batteries.  I always like it when a company includes the batteries, because it says to me that they want their product to be usable as purchased, but it's obviously not that big of a deal.  The accessories you get with the H4n pretty much say that already.  In my experience, it's uncommon to even get an SD card.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to talk about here and going into them all would take a long time.  The H4n offers a lot of great options.  It has a somewhat clunky but very usable interface.  It's very simple to operate with virtually no learning curve.  It would be great to go into detail about the interface and other features and so on, but it's all pretty good.  They did an excellent job with the most important parts of this device and that's really what matters the most.<br /><br />Overall...<br /><br />+ Phenomenal recording quality for a portable recorder<br /><br />+ Excellent built-in stereo microphones<br /><br />+ Record level adjustment buttons on the hardware, rather than just on the software<br /><br />+ Two combined XLR and 1/4\\" inputs<br /><br />+ Battery save mode by recording 44.1 Khz 16 bit WAV<br /><br />+ Replaceable batteries<br /><br />+ Doubles as a USB audio interface<br /><br />+ Comes with many accessories (most of which are actually useful)<br /><br />= Reasonably fast operation<br /><br />= Good but not exceptional battery life<br /><br />= On the larger sideen a company includes the batteries, because it says to me that they want their product to be usable as purchased, but it's obviously not that big of a deal.

B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I'm not sure anyone will be prepared for the ending of \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\\" Even if, like me, you've already read the book and know what happens, there's something about actually seeing it on screen that thoroughly and devastatingly brings it home. That's the magic of the movies for you. Indeed, this sixth installment may be the most magical yet ... albeit magical in that heavy, sinister sort of way, as if Lord Voldermort himself waved his wand and cast a spell on it. Strange that this is simultaneously the darkest film in the series and the funniest, the sense of humor having matured from innocent and childlike to troubled and adolescent. Stranger still that this is the best \\"Harry Potter\\" film since the original \\"Sorcerer's Stone,\\" a brighter and much more whimsical and story in all respects.    When reviewing \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" a few years ago, I begrudgingly remarked that I had to accept the ever-changing nature of the series, that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film had developed into something denser and would never go back. I now find myself in the exact same position with \\"Half-Blood Prince.\\" But I can't kid myself--this is a superbly made fantasy, and in spite of increasingly dark material, it retains much of the charm that attracted me to the series in the first place. The performances, even by briefly seen actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis, and Warwick Davis, are very good. The set design and cinematography are stunning. The special effects are dazzling. The mystery is engrossing. Just like before, it's all there--it's only gotten a little less bright on the way. Hogwarts, for example, no longer seems like an adventurous labyrinth of surprises but like a gloomy, gothic fortress, and the school grounds are foggier and less colorful.    The first part of the story: After the dreaded Death Eaters attack London in full view of Muggles, our increasingly burdened Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is lead by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to the home of Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), a former Hogwarts professor who knew Voldermort when he was a boy still going by the name Tom Riddle. Dumbledore convinces Slughorn to come out of hiding and return to school as the new Potions teacher. He also relies on Harry to get close to join Slughorn's class and get to know him, which shouldn't be too hard since Slughorn loves to play favorites with his students. But why does he want Harry to do this? What does Slughorn have that Dumbledore wants?    More important questions arise. Who is the titular Half-Blood Prince, and why did he add notes and revisions to every potion spell in Harry's textbook? Why is Harry's enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), spending all his time away from class? He's not the same mean, confrontational boy he used to be; he's seething, withdrawn, and seemingly always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Why is he guarded so closely by the brooding Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), who is this year's newest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?    The second part of the story: Harry and his best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are now sixteen years old, which is to say that they're in the thick of teen romances. Hermione is starting to have feelings for Ron, which is why she doesn't take kindly to Ron's new date, an infatuated young girl named Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). At the same time, Hermione catches the eye of Gryffindor House's newest Quiddich player, a smug young man named Cormac McLaggen (Freddie Stroma). She, however, has absolutely no interest in him. As for Harry, the relationship that bloomed in \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" between him and Cho Chang has been pushed aside in favor of a relationship between him and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).    As far as these characters go, I was most impressed with the way Hermione was developed. She's well on her way to womanhood, and as such, she's genuinely jealous of the attention Ron gives to Lavender. This is at times funny, as when she intentionally asks Cormac to a Christmas party. It's also at times surprisingly tender, as when she clings to Harry's arm, silently weeping. Emma Watson has always been good as Hermione, but her range has never been as far-reaching as it is in this film. The same can be said for Rupert Grint, especially during a scene in which he accidentally eats chocolates spiked with a powerful love potion.    The final act begins with Harry and Dumbledore visiting a seaside cave and having a frightening encounter with demon-like water creatures. It only goes downhill from there in terms of tone, and that brings me back to the ending. What an emotionally draining way to finish a \\"Harry Potter\\" film. Those who have not read J.K. Rowling's original novel may not be prepared for it. But even if that's the case, I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone avoid this film. \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" may be darker than its predecessors, but it's filled to the brim with style and imagination, and it reveals new dimensions to characters we've come to know and love. With only the seventh and eighth films left (the final book being split into two screenplays), we can begin the process of looking back and remembering how great an experience it has been.
1934648035|4.0|The novel is a bildungsroman, set in the oriental part of the world during the times of Gautama Buddha. A young protagonist sets out on a spiritual adventure initially joining a group of sramanas. The story unfolds his experiences that lead him gradually to higher levels of knowledge, during the course of which he finds himself fully engrossed in worldly pleasures of gambling, sex and fatherhood, liberating himself from which he rises to an even higher level of self-realization. Contrasting his journey with that of his childhood friend Govinda who is in the same pursuit, Herman conveys that one has to discover own's path towards this destination.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|It wasn't until after I had seen the entire first season that I discovered it had been based off a series of books. I was completely addicted to the show and was excited to have the books to read while I waited for the second season to start.     But in regards to the series, I think it has a little something for everyone. There's romance & sex, blood & gore, mystery, and conflict at every angle. While the books are solely in Sookie's perspective, the television series gives you insight to the lives of several characters while still maintaining Sookie as the lead character.     Watch the first episode and you'll understand.
0439023483|5.0|I don't want to spend a long time breaking this book down into what worked for me and what did not. Is the concept original? No, it isn't. Was it done in an original way? You betcha! For those adults who are looking to compare this book to BATTLE ROYALE or some other non-YA book, please keep in mind the target audience here. It's not written for adults, it's written for teens. Although, from this adult's perspective, it worked very, very well.<br /><br />Quite simply, I thought the book was fantastic, and I could not put it down. I ended up reading into the wee hours, finishing off the last 250 pages in one sitting because I just couldn't stop. I have not been THAT engrossed in a novel in years, ever since JURASSIC PARK.<br /><br />The one gripe I have about it (caution: spoiler alert!) is the bit about the teen girl who is torn between two quality boys. That's starting to feel like an old hat, sorry. Might be a fantasy for every teenage girl out there (to have two good-looking, nice boys fawning over them) but to me it's being overdone in the YA genre lately. That aside, the rest of the story was brilliant.

From Scrabble words to writing papers for work and school this is the one dictionary we turn to again and again for the definitive answer to all things vocabulary in nature.

1416550534|4.0|I picked this one up in December and put it down after a few pages.  It felt like something I'd read many times before and didn't grab me.  But it's July, I'm at the beach, and \\"House at Riverton\\" was available again and so I spent a couple of lazy, lovely days getting to know Riverton's owners and servants and not minding in the least that they were as familiar as old shoes.    The young maid, Grace, tells us the story of the Hartford family to whom she is devoted and intimates from the beginning that there is a Great Secret to which she has the key.  Grace's parentage is another secret that she doesn't seem to have any interest in at all but that the reader will figure out immediately.  Grace is ninety eight when she tells us the story so there is the lovely veneer of lost decades that permeate this book as it does other, better ones told in retrospect.  I'm thinking of \\"Remains of the Day\\" and \\"The Great Gatsby\\".  Anyone who has seen \\"Gosford Park\\" and \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" will feel they've visited this world often and the author credits all of these in her afterword.    The writing is good enough to move the story at a decent pace and while it was difficult to feel strongly about any of the characters - I've met them so many times and been more devoted to them in the works mentioned above - hints of the Great Secret were beguiling enough to keep me forging on.     I would have given this review three stars except for the wonderful denoument.  I'm grateful I read this during vacation and had the patience to wait until the end.  Any other time of year I would have put it aside, tired of the same old same old.  Or worse (and I am NOT recommending this) I might have turned to the last several pages and got the answer to the Great Secret.  This isn't great literature but it's well enough told to go along for the ride and enjoy the delicious ending.
0899682928|5.0|Most people know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote poetry. Of course, you'd be hard-pressed to make them quote a line that doesn't involve ravens.<br /><br />Well, it's time for some poetry homework -- \\"The Raven\\" is neither Poe's most beautiful nor his most striking poem. That is reserved for other, more obscure works in Poe's \\"Complete Poetry\\" -- and while one might expect the ghostly or macabre to be all throughout his work, it's also filled with transcendent beauty, wistfulness, and some truly amazing wordwork.<br /><br />Over his lifetime, Poe tried out many styles -- there are sonnets, short hymns, long rambling odes written in dramatic, vaguely Shakespearean style (\\"O, human love! thou spirit given/On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!\\"), acrostics, little exercises in self-reflection, a lyrical song or two, and some haunting stories rendered in verse like the bittersweet \\"Annabel Lee.\\"<br /><br />And the content of these poems is just as diverse. Some of them are distinctly dark -- sunken cities, tolling bells, haunted palaces, thoughts on the lingering spirits of the dead, abandoned valleys, and loved ones that have been stolen away by death (\\" I pray to God that she may lie/For ever with unopened eye/While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!\\"). And yes, it has the one about a midnight dreary, and a creepy raven with eyes like \\"a demon's that is dreaming.\\"<br /><br />And there are a lot of moments of beauty -- lush descriptions of nature, bittersweet dreams, love for a beautiful girl, and elfin odes to those who \\"put out the star-light/With the breath from their pale faces/About twelve by the moon-dial...\\" But in many of these, Poe manages to add a melancholy atmosphere -- just look at \\"Bridal Ballad,\\" whose narrator assures us that she is happy, but who is haunted by the \\"dead who is forsaken,\\" her former lover.<br /><br />Yeah, Poe's verse tends to be about as cheerful as his best known fiction, and often with some of the same preoccupations. He was a little less successful in verse at times, as occasionally you get some very strained verse schemes, like the terribly awkward \\"Eulalie\\" (\\"Now Doubt - now Pain/Come never again/For her soul gives me sigh for sigh\\").<br /><br />But like his stories, Poe's poems are spun out of exquisite, dreamlike words that can sometimes evolve into nightmares. This guy could evoke everything from ghosts to fairy-tales, brides to wormlike horrors. Even the more sentimental moments have a dark edge (\\"Oh, may her sleep/As it is lasting, so be deep!/Soft may the worms about her creep!\\").

B001FSDOZO|5.0|This band has done it again!  I love the deep bass of all the songs but am especially turned on with the lyrics of \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\".  What a great positive song!  I know these guys would be great to see live! Highly recommend this CD, but would be cautious for teens, it does have some racy lyrics in a couple of songs.  Very suggestive, you can see that by the titles.  But for a mature audience, I think you would like it!  These guys take it to the edge.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|As a vegetarian, I don't eat meat, and I knew about antibiotics in chicken feed, corn-fed cattle, and more. But, I didn't realize the influence that fast-food  and chemical companies had on U.S. agricultural practices. I am now buying more local and organic produce, due to this film. Robert Kenner's film is not anti-carnivore, but it does make a good case for seeking out the beef from grass-fed cattle, and eating wild salmon and free-range chicken.<br /><br />The chicken coops in modern America are usually dark, crowded, and unhealthy places, with animals that can barely walk, since they have been bred to have breasts double the normal size. Seeds are genetically modified and patented, and then giant corporations prevent growers from using their own harvested seed. Corn is subsidized by the government and is then used to fatten cattle, but also fattens people--and also winds up in batteries and gasoline. E. coli is now a huge problem, due to current practices. There are fewer meat inspectors today than there were fifty years ago. Many appointees to the FDA are from the industries that should be regulated. Politicians of both political parties appoint them.<br /><br />Go see Kenner's film. It may change your life.
0060723513|5.0|I disagree 100% with all of the complaints.  In this book, the Aboriginal tribe keeps to itself and has no outside influences.  Agreed? Then why would they be anything like the so called 'real' Aboriginals the reviewers say they know so well. All tribes are not the same. If you are Aboriginal and you are on the internet, or you are able to communicate with the media somehow than I believe you are far removed from the culture described. This tribe didn't want their location to be known and hence the inaccurate details you may have noticed, ensuring they can't be traced.  If you wanted to keep something hidden and never to be tampered with, would you describe it in a book with complete accuracy? No.  If my family lived in a cave, removed from society completely, would it be fair to say that when found I would be like all the rest of the white people roaming the earth, and that you would know how my family thinks and acts just because I am white like you? This is such a lovely story with such a great message.  Why put so much negative energy into complaining about something so positive.  Just because you don't know something or can't prove it, it doesn't mean you have to reject it.  I don't know how electricity works but do I reject it, no.  Doctors don't have any clue how some of the best medicines work at all.  They make a medicine for acid reflux, but instead they find it helps depression, or heart disease.  There is no science behind it, its a mystery but we trust it because it works. Trust in this story because its uplifting and has a positive message.  That's all that matters.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Having just gotten into this band over the last year, I can already say that \\"Plans\\" is their masterpiece, and one of the best cds I have heard in the last few years.  It is perfect in every way.      The melodies that Death Cab come up with are always so infectious, and they always manage to stay with you, long after you have stopped listening.  The lyrics, written by singer and guitar player Ben Gibbard, are usually pretty stellar, and he was on the top of his game in this regard on this record.     It is not easy to write and record a record where every song is both memorable and catchy, but that is what Death Cab managed to do with \\"Plans.\\"  From the upbeat catchiness of \\"Crooked Teeth\\" and \\"Soul Meets Body,\\" to the melancholy dreariness of \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" and \\"Someday You Will Be Loved,\\" and to the crushing heartaches of \\"What Sarah Said\\" and \\"Your Heart Is an Empty Room,\\" this record runs the gauntlet.      5 stars, each one of them very deserving, for one of 2005's best!
0385341008|4.0|I have seen very few negative reviews of this book and for good reason. It was completely captivating.<br /><br />Juliet is an author who begins corresponding with a group of people who live on Guernsey, one of the Channel islands between England and France. During WWII this island was occupied by the Germans, and some of the citizens formed their own literary society which enabled them to socialize during this occupation. Told through a series of letters between Juliet, the literary society, Juliet's editor and her best friend, we come to know a delightful and somewhat quirky group of people.<br /><br />World War II affected those in Britain and Europe so differently than those in America. I am fascinated with stories that describe the living conditions and how people managed to survive under such difficult circumstances.<br /><br />This is a charming, witty book that conveys not only the heartbreak of war, but the heartwarming depths of true friendship. When Juliet finally travels to Guernsey, her life is forever changed.

The album, recorded in exceptional audio quality is a must have for any pink floyd fan, any rock fan, any guitar enthusiast. The lyrics are also vastly more intriguing and thoughtful than nearly any other artist, especially today's modern music. Highly recommended. Worth $50.

B001FB55HG|2.0|I could (and often do) watch the original [[ASIN:B000OPOAM0 The Terminator]] film many times and never grow tired of it, because at the time - 25 years ago - and well beyond that it was refreshingly new in concept, the special effects were fantastic and it offered a great mixture of drama, horror and science fiction in the one package. That Arnie couldn't act didn't matter; he was perfect as the relentlessly committed cyborg. A retrospective nod too for Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, he who not only travelled back in time from 2029 to stop the terminator but happened to father a child too - the one who would become the enigmatic John Connor, nemesis of terminator-makers Skynet and general saviour of the future of mankind. It was silly but it worked.<br /><br />In SALVATION, which takes place in post-apocalyptic 2018, no time travel takes place and Christian Bale plays a slightly more youthful John Connor whose mission is to find Kyle Reese and send him back in time to become Connor's mother. Hmm. I could just about grab the idea, that this is kind of a prequel to the later year when Reese was actually sent back, but the notion that Connor's failure to find Reese wouldn't leave my consciousness; after all, if he didn't find him, then surely Connor wouldn't exist, so although it hasn't happened yet, it must do! Perhaps that's my logical mind working too hard to deconstruct the fantasy, but it does seem even more absurd than ever. On the other hand it does add weight to those who hold the belief that there is no such thing as a past and a future, that all times are in parallel with each other, that the future is just as much history as what has gone before.<br /><br />But I digress. Before tracking Reese down, Connor comes across the human-cyborg hybrid Marcus, who at times looks vaguely like the love-child of Arnie and - well, another cyborg - and who offers Connor the way into Skynet where Reese can be found. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind. Faithful to Reese's prophecy in T1, the humans created machines which have evolved in such a way that they plan to destroy their makers.<br /><br />This is awful, a very poor and sorry distant relative to the original with which it will inevitably be compared. Except there is no comparison - at least in T1 there was humanity in abundance, with everyone except the cyborg being vulnerable and with lives that we can relate to. As the franchise has developed (for want of a better word), that vital element of humanity has diminished and in this, the fourth offering, the machines have pretty much taken over completely. As a result it's difficult to care for anybody or anything, and for me that's a necessary emotion in film-making, that you care if somebody dies or not, or gets hurt or not. The overall impression is that not only will the machines have taken over the world in the future, but they've taken over Hollywood today. Christian Bale doesn't generate any charisma worthy of note, he just seems grumpy from start to finish and as with so many of his other films (such as Dark Knight, 3:10 to Yuma) he's given top billing but he's upstaged by someone else. If anything, he's best known for his tirade captured on Youtube in which he loses his temper with one of the camera crew. In the film, the cameras perform better than Bale.<br /><br />The fundamental flaw is that we are made to believe that humans are good and machines are bad, but of course it was the humans who designed the machines in the first place so any evil created was of the human's own making. Again, that's logic obstructing fantasy but as with the brain-twisting philosophies of time travel I found it difficult to ignore. The film is also like a manufactured product in that it is devoid of heart, blood and soul. All it does is make a great deal of noise, making it perhaps the noisiest film ever made. Maybe it will appeal to a younger audience now that it no longer carries an R/18 rating, but for now all I can conclude is that those who enjoy it will be twelve years old and have no experience or even knowledge of the immeasurably superior original. Apparently this is the first of a second trilogy, but in my considered judgement this series should be terminated here and now.blood and soul.

0674032810|5.0|Reading Darwin is far from painful since he does write clearly and often engagingly. The annotations are quite good although as is always the case they can be distracting as one loses the argument by stopping to read the annotations. That said, for anyone with more than a passing interest in evolution, the annotations provide background information and often help to elucidation his complex arguments. I found them most helpful and interesting. They help the reader to see an interesting and creative mind at work which is really the only reason to read Darwin today given modern additions to evolutionary theory. Layout is also quite good. Readers should know that this is the 1st edition (of 6 as I recall). Later editions had non-trivial additions and subtractions, but unfortunately they also soft-peddled some of the more extreme (and often correct) arguments, presumably because he was responding to real and imagined criticism. The general reader shouldn't be bothered by edition issues. I hadn't read Origin of Species in several years, and have enjoyed the experience again, but it takes some real work. Not airplane reading. Although there are much less expensive editions available this is the one to have.

I think the little rays of light that existed in Liezel's life, her step father, her jewish friend in the basement, her boyfriend and especially her books, made her life meaningful in such a crushing environment like Nazi Germany..this book is a must read because of it's unique style..even readers like myself are a little brighter for having done so.
0385340575|5.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is the thirteenth Jack Reacher novel, and among the best (and far superior to last year's \\"Nothing to Lose\\").    Child has a prose voice all his own -- spare, sharp and direct.  You won't find ruminations, flashbacks, dream sequences or other ham-handed attempts to give characters depth.  Nonetheless, by the end of a Jack Reacher novel you know what makes Reacher tick.  Reacher shows his inner self through his actions.  I find this a refreshing change from your typical best-selling suspense thriller.  If you're unfamiliar with Reacher, he's a bit of a Superman. Child describes a hugely powerful physique; through the plot Reacher is revealed as extremely intelligent as well.  Some may quibble that he's a bit too super; I just hang on for the wild ride.  Reacher inhabits a fairly bleak world, where there are bad guys, who are really bad, and authorities, who are some combination of corrupt and incompetent.  In this world the individual must take matters into his own hands, solving life's problems according to his own deeply felt sense of right and wrong.  \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is one of the few Reacher novels written in the first person, and far more successful than, for example, \\"Persuader.\\"  It is set in New York City, which Child knows well.  Following the usual Child formula, Reacher is just passing through when he gets caught up in a mystery he feels compelled to solve.  Violence and mayhem ensue.  Pages turn all the way to a thrilling conclusion.  Enjoy!

B00164GDD2|5.0|I'm not going to lie to you.  This is a movie from over 20 years ago, and it shows with some of the special effects, and shows even more so with the new BLU-RAY transfer.  Unfortunately, the opticals(the term that used to be used for special effects before CGI became in vogue) can't hold up to the BLU-RAY scrutiny.  Well, not all of them, some still look quite brilliant.  Some of the bright composite opticals, like the lights above the Zuul tower, still hold up and look even more striking on BLU RAY.  But, when the Stay Puft Marshmellow man shows up the composites just give way and he becomes transparent, literally.  Also, some of the composites of the actors into backgrounds with special effects it looks even more jarring, way more so then when this film debuted on Video.  Some of the Onion Head(AKA Slimer) shots have their seams showing more obviously with their new digital clarity.  I was worried about this when I heard of BLU RAY.  Older special effects benefitted a lot from the lack of digital clarity.  Bottom line though, good writing, good concept, great acting, and great direction make up for special effects.  I don't go to movies for special effects.  Modern audiences need to realize thaty the films they think are so hi tech now will look just as silly in ten years.<br /><br />Enough with the faults and onto the good stuff and the reason this thing gets five stars.  Firstly, all the special features from the 1999 DVD are all here.  Storyboards, retrospective doc with Ramis, Aykroyd and Reitman, deleted scenes, commentary, and a really cool special effects featurette, they're all here along with the trailer thank you very much.  New to BLU RAY we get three new features, one that is neat, and two that are awesome.  The neat feature is a behind the scenes look at the making of the new video game(which is a real fun play, too easy, but fun and loaded with nostalgia) that talks to writers Aykroyd and Ramis and the cast members who return to lend thier voices for the game, which takes place in 1991 and considered by Aykroyd to be the third Ghostbusters.  No Bill Murray, who is notorious for not doing publicity for anything, though he did show up for the features on the special edition of Stripes.  Next up, we get a short featurette showing the refurbish and updating of Ecto-1, which was done as a promotion for the new video game.  Aykroyd is interviewed in regard to the vehicle and comes off quite well versed in auto mechanics and old cars in general.  We get a fairly depthful look at the process of fixing the car up and what additions were made, made and hidden so not to come off too far from the original design.  It's a real treat to see the end when Aykroyd sees the refurbished car and then gets to take a nostalgic spin in it.  Finally, and most noteworthy, there's a feature called Slimer Mode.  It's your basic picture-in-picture pop video while the film is running with the cast and crew talking about making of tid bits and anecdotes.  It's much more in depth then the original ten minute retro doc and has interviews and thoughts from the entire speical effects team, Reitman, Ramis, Aykroyd, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson, designer Bernie Writson, and Sigourney Weaver.  These are newly recored interviews, not a culmination of old or vintage footage.  It's quite informative and only rehashes what was gone over in the retro doc and original commentary a few times.  I never tire of hearing the original Ghostbusters story involving time travel, dimensional jumping, and John Belushi.  It's the closest and best thing we have so far to represent a making of doc.<br /><br />The movie itself, and has done so for over twenty years, and still holds up.  The chemistry of the Ghostbusters and the natural behavior based humor juxtaposed against silly Lovecraftian mythology and the supernatural is perfect and quite inspired.  Billy Murray and Sigourney Weavers' romance and onscreen chemistry is great and glues the film togehter with some heart and human drama.  I really believed these two as a couple and a budding romance.  This film will live on forever.<br /><br />No, no BLU RAY of Ghostbusters II.  Yes, it's a weak sequel in a sense, its plot too closely rehashes the first film's structure, but it has the same elements that worked in the original, neat special effects, the entire original cast, and some laugh out loud moments.  I say bring on a special edition of the sequel, better yet, bring us the much rumored Ghostbusters III!n drama.  I really believed these two as a couple and a budding romance.

B000002KON|4.0|As I said in my review of \\"The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society\\", readers of this review undoubtedly fall into two camps. The first are Kinks' fans who have already made up their minds and couldn't care less what I say. The second, more relevant, group are those who have, like me, read something about this album - one of the great albums of the '60s and so on - and are intrigued by it. They're looking for undiscovered jewels from the '60s, have heard about how great this album is, and are wondering if it is worth buying.    For the latter group, I would argue that, as in the case of \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\", this may be worth getting, depending on what you're looking for. This CD does not include any songs that you'll recognize, and many of the songs aren't very catchy - I'd suggest getting the Village Green CD if you're looking to get a good Kinks CD from the '60s with better songs. But if you're looking for an additional '60s gem that isn't well recognized today, this album hits the mark. It involves music, along with a overriding theme, that conveys how exciting music was in the late '60s. So if you're looking for a late '60s discovery (again, I'm not writing to you Kinks fans out there), this album definitely satisfies that criterion.    As an aside, what's really interesting, to the outside observer, about this album is the extent that it builds on, or perhaps precedes, various other '60s acts. Some songs sound like they could be played by Canned Heat. Other sound like precursors to '70s Pink Floyd - \\"Some Mother's Son\\" is a very powerful, moving song that sounds as if it could appear on The Wall, or even The Final Cut. Does this make the music better? No, but if you're basically performing an archeological dig of the '60s, that's another reason to buy this CD. On the other hand, if you're looking for '60s \\"hits\\", you'll be disappointed.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Daughtry fans are going to love this album; and there's no secret why--it rocks! Their sound is terrific and every track has its own *punch* to make it last in your mind. They sing and play passionately; and there's going to be a lot more where this came from.<br /><br />Whether it's \\"You Don't Belong\\" with that awesome electric guitar; \\"No Surprise\\" with its poignant music that really adds a lot to the lyrics of a song about a love that's ended; or \\"Life After You\\" with even more outstanding music to go with those lyrics, Daughtry fans--and, indeed, rock fans everywhere--are going to love this album. These are some tunes!<br /><br />There are other numbers worth mention, although the entirety of the CD is nothing but the best. Listen for \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\" with all that passion; \\"Ghost Of Me\\" with some more incredible guitar work as they sing this beyond perfection; the moving balled entitled \\"Learn My Lesson;\\" the sensitive \\"Tennessee Line\\" that has a side dish of country mixed in with the rock; and there's also \\"Call Your Name\\" which gives us with the perfect ending for quite an album.<br /><br />Daughtry is at the top of his game here and that band is going places fast! Catch them in concert if you can!

B000WGWQG8|1.0|Unlike other reviewers, I never read the McCullough book, am neither incensed nor titillated by nudity, nor, although I love this wonderful country, am I extraordinarily interested in John Adams or many of the other founding fathers as individuals. I watched it for entertainment (it WAS a TV show), and as entertainment it was just bad.    I felt like I was watching a big-budget, nine-hour soap opera Thanksgiving special. There wasn't a single subtle or even objective minute in the hours and hours this thing dragged on, just one heavy-handed, melodramatic, grossly overacted and manipulative set piece after another. I hated it. If it got a lot better near the end (which is practically impossible), I missed that, and I'm not even sorry.    I love history, but I'd rather let facts speak for themselves and be allowed to have my OWN reactions to them than be force-fed somebody else's highly-charged emotional responses to everything, as this thing did.    Hollywood produces nothing but junk any more, whether it goes to TV or the octoplex. Nothing but mindless, formula-driven, pre-digested garbage for the mindless violence-and-laughtrack-dulled masses who would have a stroke if they suddenly had to figure something out for themselves. Thank God, there are still some imaginative, challenging, and creative independent filmmakers out there, even here in America, and the rest of the world is full of them.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|First of all, I have to say, I love the Harry Potter series, the movies as much as the books. And until now, every movie brought the flair the books had adequately to the big screen, without losing the essential messages and story points.  And now we have Half-Blood Prince.  I was curious how the movie would start, given the various excellent options by Rowling. Maybe the ingenius visit of Dumbledore at the Dursleys? Or the thrilling scene with the Unbreakable Vow? None of those! Of course not! Who would like to have a classic Harry Potter scene as the opener of your movie? The screenwriters flexed their muscles and came up with a brilliant bit of Potter legend: Harry picking up a funky chick at a Diner!    Now a simple question: here you have a book with 600 pages, and you actually choose to come up with THAT, thus bewildering the fans from the very first frame?  I mean, come on! The book has more than enough teenage romance already, what is the damn point of making stuff up?  And this does not remain the only major detour. Really, I have no objection to adding a few bits, as long as they are true to the story and the characters - but what on earth possessed Yates and Kloves to light the Burrow on fire?  This attack by the Death Eaters is THE textbook example of pointless guff, since nothing happens. And it hurts all the more if you consider for a moment that they conceived that scene instead of filming Harry's conversation with Scrimgeour, the new minister of magic.    But speaking of teenage romance, this was obviously a major part of the book, and honestly, it works better here than in textform. It is also quite logical that all the bickering and all the twists between Ron and Hermione, involving Ginny and Harry, simple can't be fleshed out, so consequently their row is not nearly as dramatic as in the book. In the book, Ron was first angry because he watched Ginny kissing Dean, which resulted in Ron being angry at Hermione because she kissed Victor Krum, whichhe wouldn't tell her, all of that causing Ron to go for Lavender Brown, and that finally pushed Hermione over the edge.  It's already exhausting explaining it, can you blame Yates for not putting ALL that into the film?  The sudden interest between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, feel like out of the blue, but the movie can't mend what the book did.    What he substracted from the romance stories, he added to the Snape/Malfoy storyline. And I don't mean scenes, I mean additional layers. And those layers come dangerously close to compromising the point the book tries to make.  To be perfectly clear: Severus Snape is a Death Eater, he always was, he only spied on Dumbledore. He has no remorse, no second doubt. He offers to make the Unbreakable Vow. He is a villain, pure and simple. That's what makes him killing Dumbledore dramatic.  Here, in the film, Snape is pushed by Bellatrix to make the Vow, clearly indicating that he is a man in doubt, pushed to do it. That is wrong, simply.  Plus, by saying verbatim that Katie was supposed to bring the cursed amulet to Dumbledore, by *showing* several times what Malfoy is doing in the Room Of Requirement, by already piecing the puzzle together along the way, the film lacks some surprise, since Dumbledore's death at the hand of Snape does not come as a shock like in the book, it is a natural consequence.  And it isn't even handled properly.  The whole point is that Dumbledore was poisened, weak. Hearing Death Eaters coming, he uses his last chance of defending himself to stun Harry, to protect him. And Snape has Dumbledore at his mercy, he is killing a poisened, defenseless man. The movie is not nearly brutal enough in that regard.  And it does not even make the point explicitly that Dumbledore's trust in Snape was wrong.  Rowling knew what she was writing in those crucial scenes, surely there is no point in completely rewriting it, implicating that it wasn't good.    Why is it so hard for these people to follow simple rules? Cut parts that don't disturb the main story. Use editorial force if following the book word by word takes too long. Make the point the book is trying to make, even if you have to do it in a slightly different way. Don't leave out signature set pieces of the book.  In short, Dumbledore's funeral is not there. That is a no-no. And unforgiveable if you ask me.  And what is that stupid ceremony at the end anyway? All the students standing there, were they rehearsing that collective lightshow in case Dumbledore ever gets killed?    The point is that things were changed for no reason. If you show Harry getting the memory from Slughorn by using Felix Felicis, the for god's sake do it like the book does, and not like THIS. They obviously didn't get the point that the potion causes coincidences leading to your goal.    One other minus point is that Harry's lessons in Dumbledore's office seem to serve no reason. It's just presented like \\"here is that little story I want to show you\\".  It is simply never explained why those memories are of any importance at all. If they wanted to set up the Horcrux storyline, then surely the story of the House Of Gaunt or the story of the cup and the locket would suit the case better than that short visit at the orphanage.    The visuals are fine, and in fact very moody and atmospheric. It's just obscure to me why a large part of the movie is coloured with that greenish hue, and the only scene in the book that actually mentions the green light - in the cave - does not have it.  The music is terrible. Truly horrid. A string ostinato here, and a string of chords there, that's all there's to it. It's not even atmospheric music, it's Nicholas Hooper desperately hitting random chords.   Often I just thought \\"he didn't score THIS?\\"  Some pieces from the album are not there, and during the Quidditch tryouts, the original score, whatever it was, was replaced by Order of the Phoenix music.    All in all, if you have never read the book, you mightenjoy this as much as the other films, but if you read it, prepare to not be overwhelmed.
B00000JMOJ|5.0|This isn't one of Arnold's most popular movies, but it's one of my favorite of all time films. It's loosely based on Richard Bachman's [[ASIN:0451197968 novel]] of the same name. Though it varies greatly from the text version, you can see the ideas from Bachman's novel througout the film.<br /><br />Since we're only 10 years away from 2019 and 12 years away from 1987 (when the film was released), it's really too far away to tell if we're gonna see the future in spandex, big-hairstyles, grainy television graphics, and all the other stereotypes of the 80s. We're more likely to see the future in a SkyNet/Terminator fashion, or something similar to [[ASIN:B001TH16DI Star Trek]]]. Still, it has that entertainment value for what people think the future might look like.<br /><br />I read the book long after watching the movie several times. The book varies from the film in that the character isn't a hulking ex-military who is conned into participating on the show, but a little unemployed dweeb who wants to \\"earn\\" money to pay for his kids flu treatment (seems that our future for healthcare is just as bad as it is today). The book has the constestants travel the globe to escape the hunters, where the movie has constestants running through a series of fenced off sections of a post-earthquake that destroyed LA in 1997 (sounds like '97 was destined to be a year of destruction, especially after watching [[ASIN:B000OPOAM0 The Terminator]]). There are many other differences throughout, but its been a while since I read the book.<br /><br />The movie has all the aspects of Classic B-Action: over-egoed action star, cheesy lines (including a rehashing of Arnold's \\"I'll Be Back\\" made famous from his terminator film), over-the-top scenerios, dramatic music, cameoes by Dweezil Zappa and Mick Fleetwood, and a few explosions, just to keep it \\"action\\" enough. It also stars Maria Conchita Alonso from many 80s films and one of my favorite actors of all time, Jesse Ventura.<br /><br />Sci-Fi and Arnold fans can't miss with this one. It's a very dated movie, true, but it shows us how far we haven't come in our thoughts on the future.h this one. It's a very dated movie, true, but it shows us how far we haven't come in our thoughts on the future.
0061767581|1.0|I love Lauren Conrad! I love the Hills, even Laguana Beach when it was on!     However, this book is garbage! It is very poorly written and very boring. I struggled to get through the first 8 chapters, but could not bare to read anymore after that.     This book is reads as if someone was descibing an episode of the Hills. The dialogue even sounds like the Hills. The fun part about the Hills is that you get to see the fashion, the arguments, the trendy places, and the drama. But on paper, all you get is drama that we already watched on the Hills. So we don't even get to see the trendy clubs and expensive bags/clothes!     If she writes another book (not in this series) I would try to read it, but my expectations are low.
B001LMT50W|5.0|Viva La Vida is a great CD, but I wasn't really sure how the Prospekt March Edition would hold up. I was pleasantly surprised. Some of the tracks seem to be a real departure from Coldplay's usual style. \\"Lost (With Jay-Z)\\" is bashed by a lot of people, but I really respect that Coldplay just wanted to do something different (although I DIDNT respect that they allowed swearing in this album - I was really surprised. Rainy Day is probably my favorite track on the Prospekt's side... it's just so upbeat you can't help but love it. Really, if you like Coldplay, this is probably their best collection yet.
B001DMJ9VA|4.0|The CD and DVD arrived in great shape, and quickly.  However, I was not aware when I purchased this item, that it was an international import, so the DVD does not play in my DVD player.
B001EO748M|5.0|Cant get enough of the Tudors. DVD are great and I liked the extras. Betrayal by the King & against the King. Off with heads, sex,war.
B00005JNTX|1.0|How can anybody take a star-filled line-up and produce a clunker like this one?  Fantasy films, shot in black and white, with a splash of color for effect, went out of fashion before they ever could be fashionable.  I'm a Bruce Willis fan to the nth degree, but this loser almost replaces \\"Hudson Hawk\\" as the worst film he has ever taken a part in.  I thought I had seen all of his movies and was surprised to have discovered this movie.  Now I wish I hadn't.  I'm not sure if I even want to add this to my Willis collection of DVDs.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Nolan did it again! This is just amazing: The acting, the cinematography, the music and the story. The most thrilling experience in the movies!  The contention Bail and Heath Ledger is breath taking. Aaron Eckhart is a big surprise!
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|I am not sure what Epica is trying to do.  The cord structure and mix of metal and opera is great.  Simone has a wonderful voice and is clearly well trained.  But the growling gets old fast.  It is simply too much and ruins the effect of the music.  Also there are sections that the machine gun guitars are also over done. These things make the album hard to listen to in one sitting.  Do not get me wrong it is still good.   Epica has incredible potential.  They are al greatly talented.  I do wish that the had more albums in the US.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I want to get this out first, I love the comics. I think none of these movies are anywhere close to represent the X-men as they are in the comics. That said, I think these movies exist in a different world that has nothing to do with the 616, except for the characters names and most their powers. I have no problems with these movies; X-men 1 and 2 were very entertaining action movies.  But even those movies should have been called, \\"Wolverine 'N Pals\\", because they didn't focus on the X-men, but on Wolverine's interaction with the other characters. My expectations of this movie were not based on the comics themselves, but on the previous movie storylines. I knew in my heart that Hollywood would somehow find a way to rape the image of one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Universe, Deadpool. So when \\"Weapool 11\\" popped up at the end I wasn't even surprised they would do something that silly. I read an interview a long time ago that about X-men 1 that the producers had to fight to have Cyclops wear the visor because the director didn't like it. So, I am not surprised nor bothered by the fact that these Hollywood interpretations don't have a clue about how these characters should be handled. I did like the previous movies (except 3), and understand that this is merely a diferent interpretation of these characters.      Wolverine Origins or, \\"Wolverine 'N Pals 4; how this mess began\\", is a very entertaining movie. But it fails to deliver a comprehensible story line. A lot of the story doesn't make any sense. The movie,( as you might be have been clued to know), is about Wolverines origins, its shows you where he came from and how his powers manifested, leading to spending a long part of his life with his half brother Sabertooth, whom we were introduced to in the 1st X-men. After many adventures and wars, the pair ends up joining a military group of people with superpowers led by Stryker. On one of the missions, Wolverine angered by Sabertooth's actions leaves the group to pursue a nicer lifestyle. This is when he falls in love with Silverfox and the pair lives happily for a while. Many years later Sabertooth comes back in a killing rampage taking out some old members of Stryker's group, and Wolverine's love is killed during this. To get his revenge, Wolverine agrees to have done on him an experimental procedure that with give him metal plated bones.        Not bad right? Love, family, betrayal and revenge. All the stuff to make a great story.  This is where it doesn't add up. For those of you that don't want \\"Spoilers\\" please don't read, as I might give away some plot details.           -After wolverine finds Silverfox dead, Wolverine a veteran of many wars, doesn't check to make sure she is in fact dead? Why did he leave her body there in the field? Couldnt't his enhanced smell detect the fake blood? Was it her manipulation power that convinced him to just move on instead of taking her to a medic.           -If she can manipulate people by touch, how the hell didn't she manipulate Stryker in letting her sister or any of the other kids go? She spends 7 years of her life with Wolvie and doesn't manipulate him, and indestructible man, to kill Stryker? Was she having to much fun maybe?           -After Wolverine has adamantium put on his bones and escapes to visit the \\"Kents\\", why on earth would Stryker send Maverick with a rifle to shoot a man that can't die with metal bones? Was he going to shoot through an eyeball from a helicopter? He missed pretty badly by the way, twice. Superman gonna be angry when he goes home to visit.          -Its revealed that Silverfox wasn't killed by Sabertooth yet after Sabertooth saves Wolverine from falling off the cooling tower, Wolverine tells him \\"this doesn't change anything\\". Why? She's not dead. She fooled you. He saves you from falling and having your butt kicked but Weapon 11, why the hell are you still mad at him?          -Stryker failed to wipe Wolverine's memories so the solution is to shoot a guy with metal on his skull on his head? How the hell does that work? How did he know it would work?           -Why did the most powerful telepath (Professor X) not control someone inside the 3 mile island release the kids? Why wait 7 years and then help.  Why didn't he do that stop time thing from the previous movies so he can save the kids? Where was Magneto? Doesnt he care about abused mutant kids? (One of the restrained kids looked like Quicksilver, who is Magnetos son in the comics)           -How come those kids couldn't get away on their own? What was that chain link fence cage they were in made of? Adamantium?            -Why was Gambit hanging out in a casino, when he knew he was being looked for by Stryker?  How was it that Stryker can't find him in a long time and yet Wolverine finds him in a day? Maybe Stryker didn't want him anymore. Maybe they couldn't persuade the Blob to talk?            -Why add the scene in the end where Stryker is going to be arrested for his crimes, when we well know that he was a high ranking military official in X-men 2?             Well these are most of the plot points from the movie that just don't make any sense. It's ok for an action movie to be extremely silly and self referential in that way. For example in Transformers when they have the teen kid take the cube and the alien so they can hide in the populated city, one of the characters mentions how dumb that idea  is. They make no excuses in this movie, and just because it's \\"supposed\\" to be a dumb action movie, there is no justification for the producers of this movie to assume their viewers are idiots, and won't care about a story plot that doesn't make any sense. Which, apparently they are correct because this movie made a boatload of cash. I will not act like there is nothing wrong with this movie just because it's flashy and has lost of explosions.               In my arrogant opinion, it's a onetime watcher. This is not a boring movie by far, yes, it's a lot of fun and tons of action and the movie's cast was really great. But the story is convoluted and nonsensical, it seems to take the audience for granted. So, if you want to enjoy this mess, just ignore the entire story and watch the shiny stuff happening on screen.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I'm a big Mel Gibson fan from way back.  It's great having all 4 of the Lethal Weapon movies in one set.  I've wanted them all for a long time, but didn't want to pay the individual prices.  Wonderful idea!
B001GAOY5U|5.0|Our family loves this movie soI ordered it.  Perhaps I didn't read the entire description from the seller but when it arrived it was a 3D thing with a disc that needed to be programmed from the computer.  It still doesn't work so I learned yet another valuable lesson -- read the entire description.
B0028K31CE|2.0|Maxwell's new album is trash and garbage. It lacks the lyrical depth he has perfected in previous albums. He goes from singing us poems to reading us a bad novel says a longtime fan. He compensates the minimal lyrics with overdone instrumentals that are mix matched, at best. Maxwell moves from songs that could stand solely on his smooth soulful voice backed (but not required) by a few basic instruments to relying on the musical arrangement to carry the track. In Blacksummer's Night he throws away this winning combo and produces a heavy handed orchestral fanfare that looses the delicate, subtle yet reserved neo soul style of albums past.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|I'm not going to waste your time with a long winded review of one of the greatest albums of the last fifty years.  If you are a fan then you know how good it is.  If you are not a fan or unfamiliar with his work, then this 1970 album should do the trick.  If it doesn't get you into Neil then nothing in his catalog will.  I'm also not going to post the same review for all four albums released, this review applies to all of the newly remastered solo albums (Neil Young, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After The Gold Rush & Harvest) with regards to sound quality.<br /><br />I had a sneaking suspicion they were going to remaster his catalog since  it took way too long for the Archives box set to come out, especially considering how little unreleased material was actually on it.  To some extent the box set, in my opinion, was a bit bloated and padded to charge a higher price.  In any event, it appears the real reason it took so long was due to the fact that they were remastering everything possible in his catalog and wanted to have it all ready to release in the same general time frame.<br /><br />I mainly want to focus on the remastering of this album, which is absolutely incredible.  The liner notes state it was remastered from the original analog tapes and was an analog to HDCD 24 Bit 176 KHZ digital transfer...uh...OK...sounds good to me!  This album sounds so far superior to the original CD pressing that it made my weak car speakers sound like they had had a BOSE makeover.  Upon hearing some of the album tracks on the Archives box set it was obvious how incredible they sounded and I hoped they would do the same treatement to his catalog.  Each album is numbered in the order they were released and a label on the back states it's part of the \\"Neil Young Archives Official Release Series\\" so there should definitely be more to come.  All of these remasters come in a standard jewel case and there are no bonus tracks.<br /><br />The sticker on the outside of the packaging stated that it was \\"remastered from the original analog tapes...because sound matters\\", and they're right.  Someday pre-packaged music will be gone to a large extent and the younger generation doesn't give a rat's behind about sound quality so we have to get the best sounding versions while we can.  Yes, I'm getting old and crotchety, I admit it.  Now get off my lawn!astered from the original analog tapes...because sound matters\\", and they're right.

B002HEOLFW|5.0|\\"Leave This Town\\" is an album which is significantly different than [[ASIN:1423446712 Daughtry]], the first album. Not much of guitar riffles are present and lyrics are more affectionate. It shows an effort from a band that has tried - and managed - to impress on its debut work and proved the ability to write and play catchy songs masterfully. So, in a way, \\"Leave This Town\\" is a piece that shows a more mature band as time went by.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|MJ at his best. Video and audio are surprisingly good for such an old concert. I saw this on a \\"65 projection TV and I was suprised at the clarity. I would have loved for them to have included the intro to the concert but this is definitely a gem for any Michael Jackson fan. Just think, they were going to record the upcoming concerts in HD and sell it for Blu-ray. That would have been great!!!!! Rest in peace MJ, the best ever!!!!!!!
B001F290E4|5.0|Heard him on a jazz station. Love the CD cannot wait to buy more of his earlier recordings or download. All the songs, even those I have not heard. What took me so long?

0385340575|5.0|Reacher is not back - he never left. Gone Tomorrow is as riveting as any of his other books. Do yourself a favor. Even if you have \\"read\\" the novels in print form, get hold of the audiobooks. Dick Hill is spectacular as a reader and you really believe he IS Reacher.    If you like Vince Flynn, Micheal Connelly, Robert B. Parker or are a fan of John D. MacDonald's McGee series, you are guaranteed to like Lee Child.
B000002J03|2.0|I'll get straight to the point. Who were the idiots that supervised the transfer of this album from the master tape to CD? Didn't anyone hear the distortion rampant thru the songs. Sure the album is 40 years old but there are old recordings of Leslie Gore (early '60's) that sound better than this.<br /><br />The distortion is too bad not to notice. The overall tonal quality of the CD has a very noticeable harsh edge to it. I can remember owning the Last Atlantic Records Superhits package that had that labels hits from 1969-70. The edited version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (included on that album)that was sent to radio stations sounded better (on vinyl!).<br /><br />Could it be maybe that the software used to take away the master tape hiss was set incorrectly???<br /><br />I would advise anyone to by the earliar CD release of this album.<br /><br />What a waste!
0385340575|4.0|For me, the most exciting thing about this Reacher book is that it's written in first person, which I've always really liked in the case of Reacher books. Most of them are third person. My favorite Reacher book is Persuader, and it's mainly because being inside Reacher's head is better than just watching Reacher. While it's nice to watch him cracking skulls, it's all the better when you can know what he's thinking as he does it.    On a 10 point scale, the weakest Reacher book is an 8. They're all pretty good. This one, then, is a 9. If you've read Reacher, you know what to expect. A great book you'll read in three days and then forget in three days. Still, the three days a year I get to spend with Reacher are great.    One thing really bothered me about this book (and this happened a bit with the previous one, too): Reacher's total ignorance when it comes to technology. Now, since it's part of Reacher's character to have this ignorance, I can't blame Reacher. I blame Lee Child. I'm talking specifically about using a cell phone as a photography device in this book. At one point, one of the bad guys takes Reacher's picture with a cell phone so that he can send the picture to his group and then they'll all know what Reacher looks like. Fair enough, makes sense.    Reacher then goes to Radio Shack to look at some cell phones (he doesn't have one). He wants to find out just how good a picture the guy might have gotten. We're told that because the cell phone might not have had \\"enough megapixels,\\" maybe they didn't get a good picture. Reacher looks at a couple phones until he finds one with a nice screen. He reasons that it must have \\"more megapixels\\" than a lesser phone. Without going into a lot of detail, the resolution of a photo a cell phone takes isn't limited by the \\"megapixels,\\" but by the resolution of the phone's screen. What I'm getting at is, whether or not Reacher's picture showed up great on the phone's screen doesn't matter. What the photographer would haveprobably done is transferred the photo to a computer and printed it out. It would have looked a lot better and the phone's screen itself wouldn't matter at all.    If you read all that and think, \\"So what? It's a very small point.\\" It is, but it's not. Because as I read through the next page after that section, all I could think about was how it didn't make sense. Since Child wrote a Radio Shack employee into the scene, but didn't have that employee explain to the ignorant Reacher why his thinking was wrong, I can only conclude that Child himself doesn't understand cell phone photography. Since this type of thing happened in the previous book as well, it seems like Lee Child needs to spend some more time researching these technologies. This kind of thing is just distracting.    I also take issue with the Ronin-esque ending to the book. In that movie, the audience is never told what's in the briefcase. In that movie it's a bigger deal, but it's still a bit of a letdown that we're never told what's in the photo that's of central importance in this novel. We, like Reacher, are left to guess. Kind of a cop-out.    Those are my only two gripes. Otherwise, the book is great. I'll of course be looking forward to the next one and tearing through it quickly, I'm sure.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|I really do enjoy watching Jane Austen screen adaptations, and for the most part, this was okay. Maybe it was because I knew that there were other things going on in the story, that when it ended, I couldn't feel satisfied. Nothing was resolved other than Anne's romance with Wentworth. I went so far as to look for 'deleted scenes' from the special feature section of the DVD - and then discovered that there was none. That was disappointing as well.    Yes, the last 10 minutes were very strange, and left me entirely unsatisfied with how it ended. I know what happens *in the book* and in other versions, though, so it's not as if I was left totally in the dark.  In fairness, each rendition of any of Austen's books needs to be a bit different than that which has come before. Some of this version's experiments worked better than others.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Although four disks long, the series went by too quickly. I finished watching it a night ago but am still in its thralls.  The production has everything: great story, scriptwriting, acting, directing, scenery, costumes and relevance.   So many things that Dickens protests against are still with us. The economic collapse that highlights the last part of the book brought about by a Bernie Madoff-like character is incredible, and, of course, the bureaucracy featured in the Department of Circumlocution has not changed.  I feel that if Charles Dickens were alive today, he would be thrilled by this BBC program.
B00005JOA0|2.0|I personally did not find this film adaptation of Anne Bronte's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" to be very interesting. I did not give the film one star because the adaptation was not a complete disaster. There were some qualities in the film that I found admirable (for example: The film conveys the main theme of a male dominated society, where females have no power).<br /><br />Unlike many people who gave the film adaptation a 5-star rating, I have actually read \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" in full. The penguin edition of the novel is 489 pages - considerably longer than Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Unfortunately, the scriptwriter did not feel that it was acceptable to create a truly wonderful and well-developed mini-series from the novel. Instead, the film is a SHELL with no juicy plot inside.<br /><br />Now, I am not saying that some people (especially people who are not literary scholars, but rather individuals who enjoy love stories) might not find the film interesting. I am simply saying that I was bored by the production.<br /><br />ANALYSIS:<br />In the 1970s and even 1980s, BBC miniseries were often produced using much of the original language from the novel (see Jane Eyre 1973 or 1983, Pride and Prejudice 1980, & Oliver Twist 1985).  Many of the miniseries followed the novel very closely. They had simply the agenda of conveying the book in drama. In some regard, these films were like a play. Often cameras were situated in a position where editing was at a minimal. Furthermore, in these miniseries, minor characters were well developed.<br /><br />Since the late 1990s, films have been overedited, and minor characters have been forgotten (Hargrave rarely gets any screen time, Ralph and Helen Hattersley along with Lord Lowborough and Mr. Grimsby are forgotten, and Helen's live before marriage to Arthur is not portrayed.). In essence, the focus of this film is very limited. Since I have read the novel, this makes the film very boring. Furthermore, some elements of plot are altered (for example: the time, place, and context of Gilbert's confrontation with Frederick Lawrence).<br /><br />Recommended instead:  Jane Eyre (1973) (1983)r example: the time, place, and context of Gilbert's confrontation with Frederick Lawrence).     Recommended instead:      Jane Eyre (1973) (1983)
B000002JSJ|4.0|This album is worth purchasing, even if just for the 3 tracks \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", \\"For Your Life\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\".  These are all hard-rocking, masterful songs in my opinion, and show that Zep had far from lost their mojo on their second to last album (not counting Coda).  While those three songs are 5-stars each on their own, the album does however suffer from 3 of the other 4 songs being mediocre, and 1 (\\"Candy Store Rock\\") being completely awful.  Either way, the album is still worthy of 4 stars, maybe even 4-1/2 considering both the strange circumstances and the short time frame they recorded it in.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|I am hoping that John Williams returns to score future Harry Potter movie's but I won't hold my breath.    As for this soundtrack it was better than I expected from someone that has never written a score for a feature movie. I thought the themes were fun and light but it lacked something. I am unsure what that something is but after I listen to it I am left feeling something is missing.     One thing that bothered me a little what that there was no thought to the order of the tracks. I mean starting out with the song \\"Fireworks\\" and \\"Professor Umbridge\\" and then starting with the intro song \\"Another Story\\". The whole soundtrack seemed to be out of order and needs to be reshuffled.
0765350386|5.0|As I made my way through Mistborn, I can't help but draw parallels to The Matrix film from 1999.  Like Neo, the main character in Matrix, Vin is a newcomer draw to a long battle for supremacy over the world.  Like Neo, Vin learns more about her powers through training with a mentor, and readers are taken along for the ride as we learn more about the basics/principles of the system of allomancy.  Lke Neo, Vin is ultimately the one that changes the course of the conflict.<br /><br />In The Final Empire, Brandon Sanderson creates a world dominated by a tyrant ruler and through his system of government in the form of obligators and inquisitors.  The \\"Final Empire\\" is as good a name as any for this government that has lasted for a millennium.  Uprising against this rule is a group of thieves led by a so-called Survivor, with the powers of allomancy, whereby the practitioner swallows a metallic compound (alloy) and burns it in his stomach to draw power for extraordinary abilities and feats.<br /><br />The plot itself is very thoroughly fleshed out, and fluid as those in power and the rebellion play a game of cat and mouse that eventually leads to a final confrontation.<br /><br />The Final Empire is a great beginning of the Mistborn trilogy, and the author deserves all the accolades he received from Amazon reviewers.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I was shocked to find out the John Williams was not involved with the soundtrack and had my reservations about another artist taking there own take on the music but I was completely floored on how good this was.    Patrick Doyle exceeded my expectations with this soundtrack creating themes that would stick in you head and working with what JW had started with the first three films. Listening to the soundtrack I could imagine what was happening at the time when the music was playing and could visualize the action in my head with the music.     I give props to this composer because he really brought the right stuff to the show for this film.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie rocked my world!!! So much so that giving it five stars simply does not do it justice.     I stumbled on to the \\"Instant Play\\" version of North and South on NetFlix a few weeks ago.  Within a week, I'd seen it at least 5 times--all four episodes, start to finish, on my computer screen.  This doesn't include the countless times I've watched the final train station scene.  I finally had to get the DVD, which I soon discovered contains many additional scenes that the NetFlix Instant Play version edited out (I think to fit within TV time slots).    I, too, first confused this movie with the John Jakes Civil War saga and avoided watching it for several weeks.  In fact, when I first started the movie (knowing absolutely nothing about it but expecting it to be about the Civil War), I was perplexed that the actors were speaking with British accents. :)    This movie is just superb.  While all of the lead and supporting roles are very well acted, Richard Armitage (John Thornton) and Sinead Cusack (Hannah Thornton) are stand outs.  As many times as I've viewed this movie, I never tire of their performances--and the scenes between mother and son are as memorable as those between John and Margaret.    I admit that I am a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice and all things Austen.  While I love Colin Firth's performance as Darcy, what I feel for Richard Armitage's John Thornton can only be described as an utterly stupid, infatuated lovesickness the likes of which I haven't experienced since my adolescence (I'm forty-something now, in case you're wondering).  It takes a special man indeed to make an otherwise jaded, old broad feel like she's sixteen again.  And I am not alone I've discovered--Armitage appears to have had a similar effect on women of all ages around world with this performance.  Aside from being tall, dark, blue-eyed, husky-voiced, and broodingly handsome, the man can act like no one's business. He perfectly embodies the complexity of John Thornton and doesa superb job of revealing the many layers of his character--one moment seemingly cruel and unyielding, the next astonishingly vulnerable and tender, but always with a core of decency and integrity that never wavers. This is HIS movie.  What an amazing performance!    As someone else described, this movie feels like a cross between Austen (romance) and Dickens (social commentary).  I have not read Gaskell's novel yet but will certainly do so now.    It's always a pleasure to watch a romance between equals--two strong characters as passionate and principled as any you'll find on screen.  To watch them slowly come to understand and respect each other is pure delight, and to have it all conclude in what has to be the most romantic and emotionally satisfying (if anachronistic--but who really gives a darn anyway after that final kiss?) ending is...well, I haven't enough words or enough stars to describe it...

0143039482|4.0|I went on a binge about a month ago and started reading Steinbeck's books, finishing with The Winter of Our Discontent.  It's not my favorite Steinbeck story, but it is a great story told well.  Sorry it took me so long to get to it.
0307454541|5.0|This is not the usual type of book I read but with the amount of praise I saw in other reviews I thought...why not.  I enjoyed the book.  It was a little hard for me to get into in in the beginning and a few places I did kind of skim....but all in all I enjoyed it.
6304806418|5.0|As people are all too quick to throw her under the bus when her acting was sub-par and/or just plain ol' bad (and often it has been)....those same individuals need to do just the opposite and sing her praises when she does exactly the OPPOSITE as she does here in Evita.  The people voting for the Golden Globes sure thought she was worthy and deserving of certain honors being bestowed upon her as well.<br /><br />A superb effort that reaped dividends, too, was put forth by the QUEEN OF POP in her portrayal of Eva Peron (Queen of Pop NOT to be confused with that highly talented yet VERY, VERY strange 'former' King of Pop and his 'cleft' chin and his '2 ONLY surgeries' total ever performed on his nose----Michael Jackson's own answer to Barbara Walters question in mid 90's interview ---.<br /><br />This was a role that Madonna was born to play.  But, while that may be true in many respects, doesn't translate into her then automatically having it then come to fruition.  Yet, upon being selected to portray Eva Peron for the Evita film version, Madonna nails it completely by leaving  nothing to chance and pouring her entire mind and soul into this role.  Similarly, just like her impeccable, one-of-a-kind, live shows are true works of art and genious in their 'own' right....I believe the same can be said, too, for the kind of work, BOTH acting & singing----SINGING, too, which did NOT come easily by any means-----the excellent job she did in MAKING the role of Eva Peron her own and to then see that effort come to fruition and ultimately resonate so well to audience members alike.
0762434279|1.0|I bought and read a full size paperback at an airport bookstore.  I thought the book was eyeopening and educational, so I ordered another copy on Amazon for my son.  The book he received was about 2\\" wide by 2\\" long!!!  So, Beware!!
1933771690|3.0|To call this book a science book is a bit of a stretch.  However, it does contain some good summaries of pertinent quantum mechanics experiments. It also does a good job of reviewing how much physics/science does not know, although I think the authors could have emphasized more that the purpose of science is to explain the laws of world we live in, not to explain how it got that way.  (See what Newton said about the nature of gravity!)  The book  contains a lot of personal information, opinions and some wishful thinking that are scattered through the text.  I enjoyed reading it but I do not think that it made the case for Biocentrism, other than suggesting some intriguing possibilities.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|RealTriggers should have been built into the original PS3 controllers.  I still think the Xbox 360 controller is superior for first person shooters, but these inexpensive add-ons go a long way to parity.  The quality is top notch.  They clip on very easily to the L2 & R2 buttons, but are easily removable if you want to take them off for certain games.  I didn't notice any scratching on the controller after I took them off.  The texture feels very much like the original buttons, so they don't feel like a bolt-on.    For five bucks, I would recommend that you give these a try.  I won't be taking them off of the controller anytime soon.

0452286751|4.0|Similarly to Atlas Shrugged, which is published by Dutton, the content being published is fantastic, as Ayn Rand intended.  The general errors in printing, however, detract from the \\"Centennial Edition\\" printing.  For instance, page 373 in 'The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition Hardcover)' the text is entirely bold.  While Plume was better about the actual printing than Dutton (who publishes Atlas Shrugged Centennial Ed. HC Hardcover) it leaves something to be desired.     It is unfortunate that one cannot rate the author, publisher, and the distributor separately. In such a system, Ayn Rand would be five stars, Plume would be one star, and Amazon.com would by five stars.
B00005V1B2|5.0|This album comes from the era of Progressive Rock \\"Concept\\" albums. Some of those worked (Dark Side Of The Moon of course!) and some didn't.  This is one that worked great - Fantastically crafted music based upon a storybook, and the music is great!   Deserves to be in the \\"Rock Classic\\" category.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|For me, this is one of my all time favorite albums, and also the one that effectively started my appreciation for this truly unique and fresh band, Radiohead.  At first I found this album very boring and dull.  However, now I sit back and wonder how did they do this?    I eventually decided to give this another shot.  I was amazed at how wrong my opinion of this classic was.  This album is very dynamic between its rockers and its slower songs.    This album has so many great songs.  Paranoid Android is an epic of Bohemian Rhapsody standards, though it sounds absolutely nothing like it.  It has its fast and hard moments, and its slow and almost grave ones.  Karma Police has a minor key signature, tight and heavy drum beat, and great vocals.  Electioneering is a very guitar oriented song, with a nice riff and a catchy chorus.  Lucky is also good.    The last three songs on this album provide excellent an excellent end to such an experimental and creative album.  A quiet space, maybe a pair of headphones, and some patience are all one person needs to appreciate this gem.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I'm not gonna give too much away, since fans who haven't seen it will be bitching about me giving all the changes away and crap. But anyways, this was an amazing movie... and yes I did read the book.<br /><br />It was every bit as dark, grim and depressing as the book, and every bit as fun too. The acting was the real highlight- Radcliffe turns in an amazing performance as Harry once again, and Watson's crying scene was one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed. The quidditch scenes were the amazing too! I'm glad they brought back the Quidditch. Also, the cave scene was brilliant, as it had one of the scariest jump scenes ever.<br /><br />So overall, this was a fun movie, and a good time at the cinema. The second best movie of the year thus far! I hope to see it again at the IMAX upon IMAX release. And it's definitely The Dark Knight of the year too- bring on Deathly Hallows!
015206396X|4.0|I first became interested in Graceling after reading a review at The Book Nest. I'm glad I followed her recommendation, because pretty much from the first page I was hooked. This is the perfect summer read for either laying by the pool or relaxing beneath a shady tree.    Our heroine, Katsa, is blessed, or cursed at times in her opinion, with a grace. In Katsa's world, a grace is a sort of innate ability that certain people are born with. Graces can be as simple as being able to play the flute really well, or as powerful as being able to read minds. Katsa's grace just happens to be killing, and as such, is exploited by her Uncle, the king, to preserve his own power and ensure that his demands are met. Katsa's role as royal enforcer often leaves her troubled, and somewhat afraid of her own powers. Deep down, Katsa is also lonely, although she doesn't realize it. That is, until she meets Po, a prince with a powerful fighting grace that seems to rival her own. As Katsa learns more about Po, and his mysterious grace, she also learns more about herself and finds the freedom to choose her own path.    This book was pure fun. The story had plenty of action, beginning even from the first page, and I found Katsa to be a complex but likeable character. The romance was sweet, without being overly sappy, although I did find Katsa's negative views of marriage as somewhat puzzling. This may sound strange, but I also really enjoyed the antagonist in the novel. We don't actually see much of his character, but his grace was just so sneaky! Cashore kept me guessing to the end as to how or if he would be ultimately defeated. I am glad that I gave this book a try and I plan on reading Fire, Cashore's soon to be released second novel.
B001W63DXC|5.0|Then buy this.<br /><br />In Febuary 2008, filming began on a documentary about the band Iron Maiden's most adventurous tour ever- The Somewhere Back in Time World Tour. The documentary was titled Flight 666 and released into theaters for one night only (I missed it :(). On June 9th, it was released on DVD and blu-ray, and along with it came a companion piece which was a 2 CD set, featuring all the recorded versions of the songs (plus 2) that made it into the movie.<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to say that this is the best live album ever! Just Aces High alone is enough to make up for the lackluster Live After Death. This album is truly amazing on every count!<br /><br />ACES HIGH (Mumbai, India)- After the churchill intro, the guitar intro begins, and then the band rush out on stage and give us one hell of a version of the song. Bruce's voice here is AMAZING!!!!! No struggling, he hits the notes perfectly. And everything just goes well.<br /><br />TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT (Melbourne, Australia)- This may be even better than the Rock in Rio version. The crowd are loud as usual, the band are really on fire here. Amazing!<br /><br />REVELATIONS (Sydney, Australia)- HOLY FREAKING CRAP. They slowed down the playing a bit from the LAD version- it's a tad faster than the studio version, but only a tad. And Jan's solo here sounds great!<br /><br />THE TROOPER (Tokyo, Japan)- Best, most chaotic, and heaviest version of The Trooper yet, plus we get some of Nicko's blistering foot speed!<br /><br />WASTED YEARS (Monterrey, Mexico)- The third official live recording of this, and the best sounding one yet. H sings a bit during the chorus... he has a very unique voice. Definitely an amazing live version.<br /><br />THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST (Los Angeles, USA)- Best version of Number of the Beast ever. Bruce is ON FIRE. Plus H improvises a bit here, which is a bit strange but cool since he is the \\"one messed up note and it's officially crap\\" guy.<br /><br />CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS (Mexico City, Mexico)- WAY superior to the Death on the Road version. Bruce sounds more up to shape here, and the solo is the best of any version of this song.<br /><br />RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER (New Jersey, USA)- The 13 minute epic. Way superior to the LAD version- No struggling Bruce here, plus to the slow and creepy part, some more cool creepy sounds have been added. Plus Bruce's \\"RAAAAAAAIIIINNNN!!!!!!!\\" scream is... whoa.<br /><br />POWERSLAVE (Alajuela, Costa Rica)- WHOA. THOSE SYNTHS. They add a more powerful and desperate feel to it- amongst Bruce's amazing voice. THis is the best Powerslave version yet, and yet the synths make it more powerful and add a tragic feel to the song, where you can sympathize for this pharoah as he's about to die.<br /><br />HEVAEN CAN WAIT (Sao Paulo, Brazil)- I say this for everything, true, but BEST HCW EVER. Everything is up to speed, Bruce is on top of his game, plus the usual audience coming up on stage during the \\"WHOAAAAAA\\" part is awesome.<br /><br />RUN TO THE HILLS (Bogota, Colombia)- The anthemic song from Maiden has an amazing rendition once again, definitely awesome!<br /><br />FEAR OF THE DARK (Buenos Aires, Argentina)- The ultimate song for Audience participation... hearing this version brought back memories of the concert I went to. The band release us the best \\"Fear\\" yet!<br /><br />IRON MAIDEN (Santiago, Chile)- The 2nd best sounding on the album! The outro, as usual, is just incredible... I get shivers thinking about it!<br /><br />MOONCHILD (San Juan, Puerto Rico)- We never thought it'd happen, but it did- the opening track to Seventh Son being brought back to life! WAY better than both the Studio version and the Maiden England version, plus Jan's solo is AWESOME.<br /><br />THE CLAIRVOYANT (Curitiba, Brazil)- Amazingly beautiful song, amazingly beautiful version too! I just plain love it. The 3 amigos do miss the guitar in the first couple seconds but then come back in, which I think sounds cooler. May be the best Clairvoyant yet!<br /><br />HALLOWED BE THY NAME (Toronto, Canada)- WHOA. IN TEARS AT HOW AMAZING IT IS. EVen futher, it was recorded in my home country of Canada! BEst HBTN for sure... everything is just plain perfect. \\"See you in the summer\\"... that's true, I did see him (and them)- June 6th, 2008!<br /><br />So in short, this is Maiden's best live album ever. Live After Death was cool, but THIS IS WAY BETTER. I listen to this album every day, and it's bar none, the best live album ever!!!!e best Clairvoyant yet!<br /><br />HALLOWED BE THY NAME (Toronto, Canada)- WHOA. IN TEARS AT HOW AMAZING IT IS.

B000ZEE3I6|5.0|Wide-eyed wonder, a sly sense of humor, a truly disturbing villain... this sixth installment in the Harry Potter series has all this plus a striking visual style. Although Potter newbies will be lost (the movie assumes you know what has gone before and who the characters are), Harry's fans will be thrilled.<br /><br />The story is complex even for followers of the series. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, after scolding Harry about being reckless over the summer for riding London subway trains, leads the young wizard on one dangerous adventure after another. The goal is to stop He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord Voldemort, who is growing in power and murdering people both in and out of the magical world. The secret to stopping the Dark Lord lies with Professor Slughorn, who taught at Hogwarts when Voldemort was simply a student named Tom Riddle. Slughorn has a repressed memory that Harry must observe to understand how to destroy Voldemort. He observes by plunging his face into liquid memories in a glowing bowl called a Pensieve. (Well named, as a \\"pensive\\" person is quietly reflecting on a memory.)<br /><br />When Dumbledore says \\"That was fun!\\" after performing a bit of magic, I agreed with him, and gave myself over to the story. In the last couple of Harry Potter movies, the characters' reaction to their magic has been sort of perfunctory and humdrum. In \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" the wonder -- and the fun -- is back.<br /><br />Most of the humor comes from teenage romances, notably involving Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Grainger, and Ron's sister Ginny. Ron's misadventures with the smitten Lavender Brown -- and Hermione's reaction -- are funny and true-to-life. Ron complains to Harry that he must dump Lavender because of the non-stop kissing: \\"My lips are getting chapped!\\" And a conversation between the two boys about noticing who has nice skin -- Harry mentions Ginny's skin; Ron Hermione's -- is sweet, and revealing.<br /><br />The considerable chills in \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" come courtesy of the evil Voldemort's birth in the young student Tom Riddle. When you first meet the boy in a memory, he is so strange, so creepy and odd, you have compassion for him. What awful thing must have happened to him to make him this way? Voldemort seems scarier here as a quietly evil student than as the freakish monster he turns into.<br /><br />The cinematography is stunning. The coloring and lighting make scenes seem like works of art. Often the color is bleached from the screen, with only one item in color (usually red). Other shots are infused with silvery light, giving landscapes and objects an otherworldly look. Steep, angular camera angles make scenes dramatic and emotional. It's a visual feast.<br /><br />One thing I didn't miss was the buffoonish Dursley family, Harry's adoptive relatives, who are absent in \\"Half-Blood Prince.\\" All three seemed too much like cartoons for my taste. The new characters are much more fun, notably loopy Luna with her oddball fashion sense and boy-crazy Lavender Brown.<br /><br />Give yourself plenty of time for this one: it clocks in at two and a half hours. When it's over, you'll be more than ready for Harry's last chapter.rtesy of the evil Voldemort's birth in the young student Tom Riddle.

0385247125|5.0|He is a tease in this book...he will tell you very detailed stories about life on the road when he was a kid, his relationship with his family, his constant regret that he just didnt have the relationship with his father that he would have liked, and especially what brought those hits we love so dearly to life ...but he was such a tease when it came to him speaking about himself, he would let you in for so long, then he would close the box. I cant say I completely blame him. though tempting. His pictures and drawings, along with his words, are worth it, and I wouldnt have missed it for the world.<br /><br />Its funny....as I was reading the book...sometimes I could almost hear him talking...maybe its just me. What the book left me with was a wanting to know more, which is natural....and a genuine sorrow for this beautiful, talented, sensitive, and misunderstood man. He saw his own potential and while in his earlier years, he was almost afraid of it in his private moments, and the most use to himself when it was working on one of his many crafts.<br /><br />I was somewhat taken aback regarding a few statements he made in the book that made me see that some of the very roads he did not intend to walk, may have trudged him away from us sooner than any of us had expected.<br /><br />He is honest, speaks from the heart and gives advice. Its a shame that he didnt write a follow up, because this book was written in 1988, 21 years ago, and much has happened then.<br /><br />I was hoping the book would be a longer read, but even when taking my time, I read it three evenings.
0679424741|5.0|Carson McCullers gradually develops a place where a deaf mute learns to adjust to a life without his life-long friend.  The author cleverly allows her characters to reveal their own concerns, always turning a deaf ear to the listener, the one who really needs to tell his very own story so desperately.  But he cannot, he must assume the burden of silence in the wake of those who spew noxious verbiage.  He must endure others' happiness in deference to his own.  These characters are vivid and colorful providing an entertaining background while the main problem builds.  And finally, we are shocked in such a way so as to shake our inner core to what hides in each of us.  What a book!<br /><br />There are many aspects of The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter that give it a status of a memorable book.  It brings us back to a simpler time when writers told a story.  I became impatient at first when I started to read the volume.  It wasn't until halfway into the work that I realized that there was something much deeper going on in the plot and something very creepy loomed over John Singer.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This miniseries tells the story of the life of John Adams from a young lawyer in Massachusetts, through his terms as Vice President and President of the United States, and along the way tells the history of the 13 colonies joining together to declare independence and the early years of the union.     It is based on the book of the same title written by David McCullough. Maybe this book was written about John Adams, rather than Jefferson, for example, because so many of Adams' letters and writings have been preserved so there was so much more material to work with. In any case, all of the central characters in this story really come to life in the movie: John and Abigail Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Quincy Adams, Samuel Adams, Hamilton, King George and many others. American history in school made me think that these historical events were 1) inevitable and 2) very dry and boring. Watching this movie has made me realize the excitement and tension and drama surrounding these events. My daughter (9) and I have watched the whole series twice and loved it both times.    Made-for-TV miniseries are my new favorite genre. Only in this form can a story really be developed, can the writers and directors really do justice to the complexities of a story. Paul Giamatti is wonderful as John Adams. I was hanging on every word.     Parents who want to watch this movie with children should know that there are some gruesome scenes. In one scene a mob grabs a man and strips him naked, covers him in tar and literally rides him out on a rail. A woman's breast was revealed in one scene where there was to be an operation to remove a breast cancer tumor. My daughter chose not to watch these parts, not because of the nudity, per se, but because the scenes depicted were quite upsetting.     These few scenes did not in any way detract from the experience for us. We will watch this movie again for the sheer good story telling in it, and to enjoy the brilliant acting of the entire cast. I hope HBO does more of this kind of miniseries.
