B001NLKT60|5.0|Once I started this book, it was very difficult to put it down. I would keep telling myself \\"just one more chapter and then I'll go to bed, or unload the dishwasher, etc.\\". Easily said... hard to do. This is a great read if you enjoy mysteries.

B0055S348W|4.0|Updated review: I can not say for sure that the update had broken the app - so it is not fair to the developer to say this in a review and am therefore increasing my rating of this app. I do notice a weird format issue that allows me to have to do some odd things to print off what I dont remember doing previously. SPECIFICALLY - When printing off a document stored on my phone, I can open a file in .RTF format through OfficeSuite 5 PRO when opened inside of the PrinterShare Mobile Print app, but can not print this off. HOWEVER - I found a work-around. I have to open the .RTF file format inside of my OfficeSuite 5 PRO app, and save the .RTF file format as .DOC - and then go back into PrinterShare Mobile Print app and open up the newly created format of the file (.DOC) and from here I can print wirelessly to my Brother 2270 wireless printer using the generic driver supplied by PrinterShare mobile.<br /><br />Older review: It's now telling me that there is an error with docs - was working before the update and wish I had backed it up before hand.

B000HC2PCM|1.0|This album is so disappointing.  BADLY produced.  Sounds like Hag's voice was remastered and put on a syncopated background.  The rhythm barely changes between songs; Hag's \\"Strangers\\" never played like muzak.  Merle Haggard is so much better than this.<br />A waste of money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Im glad I got this for my kindle. It is a great game to kill time. Plus, you can be more comfortable while playing...unlike with a real deck of cards.

1615243496|4.0|The book arrived within a week of purchase, in wonderful condition. the gold pages were barely faded which added to the positive. There was some minor shelf ware, but that was said in the description and was acceptable, just around the corners, and the spine was slightly detached from the pages, so i had my school librarian reattach it with book glue, no cost and not a big deal. Overall a good read and a great place to purchase a book from.<br /><br />Also,I ordered this with Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, and Dracula of the same publishers. All are great reads.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is very cool and has a ton of levels to unlock...this game makes you work hard and also makes you think and therefore. it is adicting and fun!<br /><br />this app is an app that costs money but it was totally worth it! this app should be the app of the year. also it is fun for all ages! :-)<br /><br />so this app is great and if you want another great app get weres my water I would know! hope it helps!

You can add new locations such as your relative's city to keep up with their weather too!<br />I like that I can just tap the 'Messages' area, upper left corner on the Kindle Fire, and get a quick glance at the current conditions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great game as a time filler. Rainy days and snow days. With no time limits play away.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|People need to learn to stop leaving bad feedback just because the game doesn't work on their phone. Did they ever stop to think its crashing because of the setting on their phone, or operator error, or maybe too much running while trying to play?  Either way... nothing works on EVERYTHING.  Good game though... very addictive.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The price is right on this microphone and allows for isolating just one person's voice on an interview. The cord is way too long though. It frequently gets tangled in my bag and is a hassle to get untangled each time I need to use it. It would be ideal if the cord came shorter and for times when one needs a longer cord, to plug in an extension.

0984380213|5.0|Predictable Revenue is one of the finest books on generating sales opportunities.  I have read hundreds of books on sales over the last 10 years and I would put Predictable Revenue in my top 3.  This book is more than just fluff, there are a ton of actionable steps included.<br /><br />I'm almost sad to give away my \\"secret\\" weapon; the Cold Calling 2.0 Process as outlined in PR.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This actually a great puzzle game but I found myself getting bored with the levels after a while. The object is to pack the grocery bag so that nothing gets crushed and everything is supported. The scores get tallied and levels must be completed in order for others to be unlocked. It has an Angry Birds feel to it, so all in all it is a very fun puzzle game especially if you like Angry Birds or games similar.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I originally had a Sony E-Reader, so Kindle was not an option but now I have a Lenovo K1 Ideapad and the app is available. While the Kindle app does have some good settings like highlighting a word to get the definition, font size and text, easy sync and great night mode. The formatting leaves a lot to be desired. Bundle books become one long book and all the books I have read have yet to have an option of jumping or returning to a page or chapter. Which come to think of it I have not actually read a book with page numbers, just percent of how much of the book has been read. The free books and having them linked to my Amazon account are a plus but the formatting takes this app from great to just okay.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is super fun and addictive. There are three modes of play, classic, quest and endless. The quest can be beat in a few days and classic has 99 puzzles. The endless mode goes on until you run out of specials or....I do not know. I have been playing endless for days now. I honestly believe that this is one of the best Mahjong games out.
B002EWD0I6|3.0|We were happy that the series was available first.  We enjoy it and was looking forward to seeing the first season.  About half way in the first segment, the DVD stopped playing and skipped to another part.  Them it did it again.  Finally we had to go to the menu and select a later segment to play but we didn't get to see all of the first part.  Other wise we were happy.

At the time Watan­abe devel­oped strong rela­tion­ships with two women whose per­son­al­i­ties are oppo­site of one another. Naoko is beau­ti­ful yet trou­bled while Midori is out­go­ing and lively.<br /><br />Nor­we­gian Wood by Haruki Murakami is a mem­o­rable story, yet sim­ple and unas­sum­ing.

Watan­abe copes with loss through­out the book and the tale, told in flash­backs, is mostly how he copes with them.<br /><br />The char­ac­ters are well defined and real­is­tic while they bat­tle tragedy tossed at them at every turn by Murakami.

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Kinda repetetive and low replay value but a very fun and nice look game, a shame only a few of the weapons are actually useful
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I did<br />the entire series. I was captivated by the writing<br />and could do little else but keep turning through<br />the pages of all three books until the end.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|So I may be the only person in the world who actually did not particularly like this book. I found the storyline to be VERY disturbing and not something that I wanted to read about. All I could think throughout the whole book was how absolutely sick and disgusting it was and that really turned me off from the whole story. I thought the characters were somewhat shallow (but since they had to be all for themselves then I guess that makes sense) and the storyline - while original - was very familiar. The undertones of the story very much reminded me of the Uglies series by Scott Westerfield (even though the plot was very different I felt like I was reading the same story). I found the main characters to be weak and unlikable (I did like Gale but he just wasn't in the story enough for me to get a real feel for him). I also did not like how the author never clarified what went on in the past to make the world the way it is in the story. We read that The Hunger Games are a sacrifice but we never fully understand why.<br /><br />Also, (and this really bugged me) what was with the mutts at the end of the story? I don't understand how the author just threw them in there and never explained them! Were they genetically made? Are the tributes not really dead? I kept expecting some kind of plot twist to happen where we found out that the tributes never really died...<br /><br />Overall I found the message that this book sends to be horrifying. There is no moral twist at the end for the readers. It basically sends the message that you can only depend on yourself to live and we all know that is not true! This is certainly not a book for children or teens - why this is popping up on school reading lists I can not fathom.<br /><br />I agree with a lot of readers about this being a fast paced and quick to read book (I read it in one day easily) but this does not make it good! If you are a parent I highly recommend you read this before letting your child pick it up. I was afraid I wasgoing to have nightmares afterwards, I can't imagine how this could damage a young child!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I exercise a lot but have been neglecting my core.  Great very good workout with multiple levels.  Nice to have the app pace me through the workout.
B0061S073A|5.0|Stumbled across this app and LOVE it!  There's no way to turn off one-touch purchasing on the Kindle and this app saves me from having to worry about my kiddos hopping onto the wi-fi &amp; buying stuff. I just turn it on &amp; let them play the games I've selected for them. Love it!!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|The story is timeless, with something for everyone! Romance, human nature, man's greed and cruelty, and, of course, it's a great ghost story!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Picked up this book and haven't been able to put it down. This book will have you at the edge of your seat. There are surprises around every corner that keep you interested. It is fire!  P.S. Team Gale &lt;3
B000TEPLFQ|5.0|Mezzanine was their first album I heard. I've recently listened to Blue Lines and it's a whole lot different than Mezzanine. It's not as atmospheric and complex or as dark. Blue Lines is the first album of the Trip-Hop genre which was created by mixing Rap, Soul, R&B, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Dance, House, Alternative, Reggae and Electronica. It's the first Massive Attack album from 1991, it's a difficult choice between Blue Lines and Mezzanine. Mezzanine is more unique, complex and atmospheric but Blue Lines is more enjoyable overall. Blue Lines is just phenomenal, it's too good to explain in words and it's one of the best albums ever made (in my top 10 favorite albums).

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|At first, I was very against going with the fad for playing Angry Birds.  Then, I downloaded the free version.  Ever since those pigs laughed at me, I believe that I was hooked.  This game is very addicting but it's great at strategy and tactics.  You only get a certain amount of birds and a certain type of bird in a certain order to take out all those egg stealing pigs.  Very enjoyable.
B00457WZEI|5.0|When I picked the book up, I really did not know what I was getting into.  This book did not disappoint.  Great read!

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Like many of the reviewers before me, I will say that The Tree of Life is not a conventional film. Don't go in expecting to escape because it won't let you.  The Tree of Life is a movie that forces you to think, to evaluate, and to question. When watching you must be engaged, analyzing the story and analyzing yourself. Don't go in thinking you'll be able to close your mind off because you won't be able to.  That is the beauty of the film.<br /><br />Hinging on ideas of spirituality and philosophy, The Tree of Life asks questions about the role of God and the role of man.  In a masterpiece of cinematography, writing, and acting, The Tree of Life causes you analyze your beliefs and the path of your life. Do you follow the way of nature or the way of grace?<br /><br />This is my first Terrence Malick film and I plan on watching more.  I honestly believe Malick is a film making genius.  In a grand array of stunningly beautiful imagery and intellectualism, The Tree of Life is one of the deepest and most breathtaking films I have ever seen.  Never before have I been moved at the lengths I was when I first saw Tree of Life.<br /><br />If you want explosions, action, or anything of the sort, this movie isn't for you.  If you want to think, analyze, and be witness to some of the greatest cinematography in the history of film, take a chance.  Odds are you'll enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a great game to fill those little moments that are not enough to read part of a book.  I play it during TV commercials.
034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh<br /><br />This novel captivated me immediately when I read an early review of it.  It is the story of  Victoria, a foster child in northern California, her experiences as a child moving from one home to another,  her experience of \\"aging out\\" of the system and becoming a mother herself.  It is also the story of one of her foster mothers, a couple of mentors, and a lover.  They each have their own history that leads them to Victoria, and their own history that determines their responses to her.<br /><br />What initially intrigued me and made this story a little unusual, was Victoria's use of the language and meaning of flowers as a way to communicate her own essence and way of experiencing life.  As a psychotherapist, I felt the story was fairly realistic regarding her difficulties with attachment disorder as well of the difficulties that caused to those around her.  The ending was not obvious to me, although I also found that to be realistic and not so romanticized as often happens in novels.<br /><br />I give this one five stars, and recommend it to anyone interested in foster care, alternative healing, OR flowers!

B0000C9V3T|4.0|Coupled with a few sound bites of dialogue from the movie itself (probably so we don't forget the context of the album), this is one of Tarantino's best compilations. As usual though there's a few tracks missing.  He probably couldn't get the rights to put them on the album, is my guess.

0307957934|1.0|I purchased this book because it was recommended in the USA Today.  The first 3/4 of the book are okay...hedge fund, big money, trendy, believable, exciting,  smart and worth the read.  The final 1/4 was horrible.  The author Robert Harris needs to scrap the ending and rewrite.  The ending is so sci-fi and ridiculous.  I actually was thinking of writing Robert Harris and asking him to rewrite the ending ...but Amazon asked me to review. Mr. Harris with the most humble of requests...really the computer comes alive?  Why not have the wife and the business partner be space aliens from Mars who fooled Alex and took his company?  Really any other ending would have been better than the computers are alive.  I did like the textured book paper cover and THANK YOU for the large font size makes the read much easier on my 50 year old eyes.
0525478817|5.0|I was looking for something different to read and randomly selected this book on the reccomendation of amazon. I stayed up all night reading it as I could not put it down. I laughed and cried, often at the same time. This book was so beautifully written and the characters so real I did not even realize that hours had gone by. John Green is an extremely powerful writer and developed characters so sarcastic, charming, and loveable. I will now begin reading everything he has written with the hopes that they are all just as amazing as this.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Amazon has this listed as a 4-star movie. Please don't make the same mistake I made. 171 people gave this movie a 5-star rating, 43 gave it 4 stars, 30 gave it 3 stars, 37 gave it 2 stars and 101 people hated this movie as much as me. How Amazon can give this movie a 4-star rating with numbers like those is beyond me.<br /><br />I shut this movie off in the first 28 minutes, because it was that freaking bad. So, I can't comment on the whole movie. But, here's what I encountered in the first 28 minutes:<br /><br />1. A pretty cliche opening scene.<br />2. Really stupid soundtrack that made me think this movie was made in the 1980's. Seriously. It reminded me of a combination of Yaz and Herbie Hancock. I thought I was watching a 1985 after school special.<br />3. Uneven sound volume. I was constantly having to turn up my volume to hear people talk and turn down my volume during driving/music scenes (very annoying)<br />4. Very little actual acting. The only actor who actually showed any talent in the first 28 minutes was Bryan Cranston (Walt from Breaking Bad). It's too bad he played a supporting role in this piece of garbage.<br />5. The main character, Ryan Gosling, didn't say more than 28 words in the first 28 minutes. 28 minutes might not seem like a long time, but when you're waiting for the fun to start, 28 minutes seems like eternity.<br /><br />I am so enthusiastically upset about renting this movie that I'm going to ask Amazon for my money back. This movie is NOTHING like its trailer, and it doesn't deserve its 4-star rating. 383 people rated this movie on Amazon, and about half of them gave the movie 3 stars or less, with 102 people flat-out saying they hated it. LISTEN TO THEM.

1402770006|5.0|The classic Sherlock Holmes case \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" gets the graphic novel treatment in this 2009 production.  Ian Edgington does a nice job adapting Conan Doyle's original text, while I.N.J. Culbard's artwork captures the key characters and the dismal Devonshire setting of the novel in a distinctive style.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes fans are familiar with the storyline.  Holmes and Doctor Watson are consulted on the safety of the new heir to Baskerville Hall, following the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville.  The Baskerville family is haunted by a hideous legend about a gigantic murderous hound, and the friends of new heir Sir Henry are anxious to assure his safety.  The investigation by Holmes and Watson points to both human and seemingly supernatural threats; Sir Henry's life will hang in the balance in a thrilling finish.<br /><br />This adaptation captures large portions of the original dialogue, including a key scene at the begining which illustrates both Holmes' deductive powers and his relationship with the ever-patient Watson.  If not quite a substitute for Conan Doyle's original, this graphic novel is an entertaining presentation and highly recommended as an introduction to the Sherlock Holmes stories.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Thank you for the excellent update. I choose you for weather! Please keep up the great work weather channel guru's.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I ordered this for my 6 year old son (he is very mature for his age).  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it myself.  This movie had it all, action, drama, love/family.  Great movie. Glad I purchased it.
1594203334|5.0|(first of all, excuse my english ;-)<br /><br />As a French reader, I cannot really imagine how controversial this book is in the US... because Pamela Druckerman description is exactly what we do in France.<br />I agree with her analysis of the four meals a day, of \\"the Pause\\" (which is, according to us, just good sense, and not conscious at all!), the important of having a life as a woman and not only as a mother (séduction, losing weight, sexuality... are very encouraged and important after having a baby, to be considered as an entire woman... and i think it's good!), the importance of saying no, of having time for ourselves, to let the entire family breathe!<br />She could have added some perfection in her analysis of our way to see breastfeeding, stay at home mothers (Paris is not France, we can find women who choose to stay at home... but it is true that even them keep a life, pleasure, whith few guilt). Don't forget too that France has a high rate of unemployment, women at work are not treated equally as men (less paid)... things are not so easy for french women. But I admitt that's not the purpose of the book... The author is right when she sees a similar philosophy of educating our children, from north to south of France.<br /><br />I had a lot of pleasure reading this book... very instructive for us Franch, making us realize the chance we have with \\"crèches\\", \\"école maternelle\\", etc...<br />A very useful \\"guide\\", for American parents but for the French too!

B001041JLE|5.0|It is a shame that many of today's listeners rely on MP-3 and similar players for their music.  With a very good \\"old school\\" system this is a fabulous recording sonically and musically. If you are going to look for a reference standard, this is it.<br />  It's gonna be (it is actually) an all time example of what popular music should be. with this record the late Michael Jackson is in the same company with the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Nat Cole, Satchmo and the others. No truly weak songs in this album and the video is really watchable.<br />  This is a DESERT ISLAND recording through and through.

1568363931|5.0|Love it! I've been a fan of the author's site for awhile, but it's lovely to have recipes in a handy cookbook format. The photographs are beautifully done, and each presented bento contains full recipes for everything in it so you can mix and match as you like. The instructions are clear and well-presented, and I've not tried anything yet that wasn't delicious!<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this particular bento cookbook is the variety of recipes. There are more traditional Japanese recipes as well as recipes for other bento-friendly foods. A bento is simply a lunch; it does not have to be entirely Japanese food. The variety of cuisines represented inspire you to start thinking about other things that would go well in a bento, yet it still covers a lot of more traditional elements like cooking rice, tamagoyaki, and more.<br /><br />There's also some great information about types of boxes, care and cleaning, and packing boxes to avoid shifting. Overall, it's a great resource for anyone who likes to pack lunches the office will be jealous of.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I usually try not to give 5 star reviews to best of packages, but \\"Experience Hendrix\\" does everything right. Let us also face a dubious reality; Jimi Hendrix has been repackaged and reissued as much as, if not more than, The Doors, The Beatles or any other great artist to have ceased to be. How many versions of \\"Hey Joe\\" do you need, after all? However, with 20 songs from 5 albums, extensive liner notes, a lot of great pictures, \\"Experience Hendrix\\" beats any other single disc Hendrix anthology out there. It's also given a loving remaster, with the squeals of Hendrix guitars and the phase-crazy production in all its experimental glory.<br /><br />All the songs you'd expect would be here (\\"Foxy Lady,\\" \\"Purple Haze\\" and - even though I could go the rest of my life without hearing it again - the Woodstock version of \\"Star Spangled banner\\"), along with chocks of Hendrix incredible work.

0525478817|5.0|I really don't have the words to express how much I loved this book. On the surface, it's an ill-fated love story. But that hardly scratches the surface. This book is about life and living life to the fullest while facing the inevitability of mortality and oblivion.<br /><br />I fell in love with Augustus Waters on the very first page he appeared.<br /><br />John Green is one hell of a writer. Not only did he capture a teenage girl's voice perfectly, he also has that uncanny ability to make me laugh and cry at the same time. It's not easy to simultaneously break one's heart and offer healing, but John Green can do that. And he did it so very well.<br /><br />To be honest, I put off reading this book for nearly two months because I was afraid of reading some Debbie Downer book that I couldn't handle at the current point of my life. I heard \\"cancer\\" and immediately thought of Lurlene McDaniels and how I used to read her books and bawl until I couldn't see anymore.<br /><br />This is not the same sort of story.<br /><br />There is cancer, yes. There is also reality. But there is also love. And there is life.<br /><br />It's really the best kind of book.<br /><br />It will definitely get a reread.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I told my friend about \\"If I Stay\\", which I couldn't stop raving about...two weeks later she told me she was done with the second book, a part 2...\\"where she went\\". She couldn't stop raving...and now I know why.<br />This is a beautiful read. I cried while reading it and again while telling my loved ones about it.<br />I highly recommend both books. Fast, funny, heartbreaking and heart mending. Gayle Foreman is now my favorite author.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I was browsing aimlessly in a bookstore trying to take my mind off the stress of my father's recent massive stroke when I came across this book. I started reading there in the bookstore, could not put it down and have since passed it on to my siblings who've had the same sense of enlightenment as I felt. I now have some sense of<br /> what my father is going through -  the fear, frustration and sheer terror of what has incapacitated him.<br /> If you have a family-member/loved one who has suffered a stroke, you MUST read this to understand/remember that<br />  he/she is still there, inspite of their current physical state who's capable of learning, hurting, feeling emotions. I see so many similarities in what the author went through, and while my father's advanced age may not result in the same return to active life as the author, I  see  small signs of recovery, each of which represents a tremendous triumph. Forget what the Doctors tell you. Take it from someone who's been there and back. Buy this book.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I was surprised this movie did not win more Academy Awards.  For me, and my wife, it was like  \\"the perfect movie\\" with the scenes, the dialog, the characters - both real and fantasy -  and how they blended together. Wow, I will  watch this movie over and over again.
B0068RGVMK|5.0|Imaginaerum has a selection of songs, some offer a quality of instant gratification where they become your favorite right off the back, but the other songs take time realize their power. That is not to say some are good and some are bad, for they certainly are all good, nye, fantastic! What I would like to say is that they all offer a very unique experience and hold a great potential for replay value. This album, for me was totally worth its cost. It lived up to all the hype, no buyers remorse here, nope!<br />SO.<br />I would, do, will totally recommend purchasing this product.<br />If you read this, thank you for your time; if you buy this, you won't regret it.

B003Y5HWMW|1.0|My friend recommended this series to me. I went into it with fairly high hopes because I love fantasy and I love Sean Bean. The opening scenes were promising, but it spiraled so quickly into gratuitous trash that I almost turned it off. Truly, I wanted to stop watching it after the first episode, but I continued it because I half suspected that it might take a turn for the better (I mean, my friend raved about it), and like I said, I adore Sean Bean. And to be fair, his character is lovely. I look back and can see that that character (Lord Stark) is really what got me through what was an otherwise torturous experience. I have never seen something so depressing, disgusting, and utterly frustrating. I felt like I wanted to wash my insides out after I finished it. Is this what people like these days? Stories that have emotional threads that spit in your face? Stories that glorify the nasty and take cheap shots at goodness, honor, and decency? Seriously, more disturbing than this series is that so many people enjoyed it. What that says about our modern culture is dismaying to say the least. So if you decide to watch it, just be aware of what you're getting into. It's disturbing and overly violent and sexual to the point of being pornographic. The bad guys win and the good guys lose. I would say that it's also misogynistic, but that's probably putting it too lightly. This series is misanthropic. If that's fantasy, then good god, take me back to reality.
1451648537|3.0|Based on more than 40 interviews, Walter Isaacson was selected by Jobs himself to conduct his biography. From start to finish, the book reads like a novel. The book is intricately done; colorful descriptions make it easy to connect with everyone. It's clear that Steve Jobs was as revealing as he could be and wanted a straight record.<br /><br />The author speaks glowingly about Steve. It seems that over the years they spent, Steve rubbed off on him in a positive way. He claims that Steve is the 'greatest business executive in the world' and will be remembered a century from now. Whether Apple will exist a century from now is probably on most people's minds. With Jobs gone, will the company be able to continue its innovation and culture?<br /><br />Jobs' executive behavior would make Wall Street executives blush. He back dated stock options, misinformed investors (securities fraud), and demanded a private jet. I was astonished when the author said Jobs impressed the value of honesty upon him. Almost every other page a friend or colleague mentions Jobs' lack of integrity. There are several examples where he blatantly lies, or takes credit for others ideas.<br /><br />During meetings, Jobs usually responds in expletives, and many employees mention feeling hurt by his lack of empathy. Jobs at one point e-mailed Michael Dell saying that \\"CEO's should act with class.\\" This is odd. Jobs would abruptly end contracts, park in the handicapped spot, and make analogies between his competition and the devil.<br /><br />The book is nicely segmented, with lots of short chapters. This makes the read speedy, and hard to put down. The book serves a dual purpose; it's an account of Steve Jobs and technology over the last 4 decades. From Bill Gates to Larry Ellison, dozens of Silicon Valley titans are mentioned. Their stories are revealing and interesting.<br /><br />Although the book doesn't show Jobs in the best light, readers get a great history of technology for free. Young entrepreneurs looking for lessons will be disappointed. Isaacson did a poor job at dissecting how Apple did one of the biggest turnarounds in history. There are a few sentences on his business values, (focus on a few products, build a team of A players, etc.) but little on his day-to-day activities. Did he meditate daily as he did in his twenties? Did he get to work really early or telecommute? What were his goals when coming back as CEO?<br /><br />Although I personally feel it's too early to put Jobs in the same sentence as Edison or Ford, it's up to you to read the story and decide for yourself.eneurs looking for lessons will be disappointed.

0674049160|5.0|For anyone moderately well versed in Austen , this book offers  a fair number of notes that elicit a \\"yeah, I knew that\\" response. However, there also are an equal number of notes that provide insight and background that adds a great deal to the enjoyment to the reading. Recommended for all but the most informed Austen scholar.<br /><br />Be warned, that reading the notes along with the story will immensely lengthen the time it takes to get through the story.
074322454X|5.0|Point: Good military companies are not thrown together from the best recruits, they are forged through the heat of battle, shaped by the constant pounding of steal, and honed by strong leadership. When one has endured that, he may proudly say, \\"I served in a company of heroes.\\"<br /><br />Path:  Ambrose follows the Easy Company from the 506th Regiment through training at Camp Toccoa, to Normandy, Hell's Highway, Bastogne, and Berchtesgaden. They suffered 150% casualties, they saw their companions riddled with bullets, frozen in the snow, drown, and lose their sanity. They pushed forward taking risk after risk. These men gave not only their years to the cause, but much more.<br /><br />Sources: Ambrose, as usually does an excellent job with journals, interviews, letters, and military information.<br /><br />Agreement: This book shows the horrors of war and the effects it has on the conquered and conquering. It does not gloss over lose. It does not hide the wickedness that arises in a man, American or German, who hates. War is war.<br /><br />Personal App: As I read through this book I was so thankful for my friends and relatives who have served in military duty. My Grandfather fought in WWII and I am proud to be his grandson.<br /><br />Favorite Quote: \\"The memory of starved, dazed men,\\" Winters wrote, \\"who dropped their eyes and heads when we looked at them through the chain-link fence, in the same manner that a beaten, mistreated dog would cringe, leaves feelings that cannot be described and will never be forgotten. The impact of seeing those people behind that fence left me saying, only to myself, `Now I know why I am here!' \\" (263)<br /><br />It would be worth another read and I would recommend it.
B0015DROBO|1.0|A significant theme in this book is gross male physical and sexual violence,  and murder against women. Spiced with a little computer hacking. No literary merit. Trash.
1586487981|5.0|It explains how the world looks from the eyes of the poor (i.e. &lt; 1$ a day). It is especially eye opening for people who have a secure life and are almost always totally ignorant about the poor. The chapter about education was fascinating because the problems are so relevant to my own country, Turkey. As someone who regularly donates via Kiva, the microfinance chapter showed clearly what to expect from microfinance and what not to. I was embarrassed to see my half-baked ideas naked in front of me and from time to time became quite emotional. Besides sadness my disgust for so-called intellectuals who lecture the poor about what to do increased ten fold.<br /><br />In short, this is a must read book not only to Kiva lenders but to everyone because what happens to the poor affects all of us in some way or another. The privilege of having a secure life entails responsibility. To act responsibly, you must first understand what the real problem is. Detox your brain...

LOL<br /><br />This movie is really funny, of course there is language, crude humor and vulgarity- But, it's not too much.... in my oppinion. Some parts are funnier than others, but I did enjoy this movie... and I really can't remember the last comedy I enjoyed. This received the same rating as 'Bad Bosses' which was only a quarter as funny.... so I felt I should throw a FOUR STAR on here, to make sure this movie got it's props. Enjoy!

B0052YAKS6|5.0|I listen to the BPM Dance Channel on my XM car radio and they play a lot of selections by David Guetta. I've always thought he was okay, but not something I'd be buying. Also, he's appeared on my list of Amazon recommendations a number of times and I've just ignored the advice. Well, lately, I've watched him rising on the Rolling Stone Top 50 Albums list. Hmmm, he just never seemed that good. Then he again appeared on my Amazon recommendations list and this time I bought his \\"Nothing But The Beat\\" CD.<br /><br />\\"Nothing But The Beat\\" is an excellent CD. Good listening! It's beat-dominated music, as you might expect from the title. I'd say it's House music with a strong Hip-Hop influence. The 13 tracks have a plethora of featured Guest Artists including Flo Rida and Wil.I.Am. Although the music has such a host of guests, it sounds well integrated as if it was from a single band rather than a bunch of separate and non-related tracks. I guess that's Guetts's work and he's done an excellent job of it. He also has added a lot of deliberate distortion of many of the vocals so that they sound like electronic voices. I like it. Nice touch. Good sounding! These are good solid tracks, believe me, and they go well together. It's party, party, party music. Turn up the volume! The sound is quite good, I might add, if not somewhat overwhelming. I have to keep the neighbors in mind in that beat-heavy music seems to bother them. I think it's my powered subwoofer that makes them aware of it. I never have any trouble with the TV, but music like this will bring them over for a visit. Such is life. In any case, this is an excellent album and I'm definitely re-appraising David Guetta. From this recording, I can easily understand him getting into the Rolling Stone Top 50 list.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B00005JKCH|5.0|When I was a little kid and learning to read (mid 40s) I just loved the funnies. I'd get the Sunday paper comics section out and spread it on the floor and get down on my hands and knees and read the entire thing. Even Prince Valiant, although he'd come last. The first things were Superman, Dick Tracy and Batman. I loved super heroes and super bad guys. They were my favorites! I don't remember Spider-Man and it's possible that he didn't come along until later, or perhaps our paper just didn't have him included. Amazingly, a lot of these super heroes have stayed with us and now are on radio, television and in the movies. Well, I've seen a couple Batman movies and \\"Superman Returns\\" and I thought they were awful movies. These guys were much better as a part of my imagination!<br /><br />Well, the other day I picked up a Spider-Man movie (Spider-Man DVD Special Edition) off a deep discount shelf and I just had to see what it amounted to. Maybe it helped to have never read Spider-Man comics. In any case, the movie got off to an appealing start and about the first third was an enjoyable, if not somewhat touching, story.  Spider-Man (before transformation) was a teen-aged nerd and he lived next to a very pleasant and nice-looking young lady. They'd lived side by side for a number of years, but had never met. Alas, a reminder of my own shy and misspent youth. In any case, Nerd-Boy gets bitten by a spider and begins to take on some remarkable changes. It doesn't really get going until his Uncle (acting Father) gets killed and then the transformation into Spider-Man takes place in a rather short time. At this point, I quit watching the movie for the rather weak story and started watching it for the sets and remarkable animations.<br /><br />Hollywood is second to none when it comes to movies like this. I'm amazed! It's action, action, action as Spider_Man battles the Green Goblin. Biff, slam, crunch. Destroy this. Destroy that. The movie must have cost a fortune to make! The actors perform gymnastic feats far in excess of that any Olympic athlete could do. And do it in rapid sequential order. Well, you know Spider-Man is going to ultimately win, but who cares? Have you ever been to a Super-Hero movie where he/she didn't win? Alsa, the story is down the drain. I'm watching the wonderful stunts and animations. How do they ever do such things? Who cares about the story? There's an extra DVD (my Spider-Man is the Special Edition package) but I didn't watch it. Perhaps sometime in the future. I want to remain in awe at the marvelous technology, both in this movie and other movies like it. For me, the enjoyment is watching this thing unfold, not the story.<br /><br />Gary Petersonactors perform gymnastic feats far in excess of that any Olympic athlete could do.

DiCaprio does the best he can with the role.  What distracted me, though, was the use of constant shadow, filtering, and a palette of browns and grays.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|A lot of people on here are saying aDwD and the previous aFfC didn't live up to the first three books. Frankly, book two was the worst. All sorts of marching up the Kingsroad and marching across the Red Waste and marching to battles that never really happened in our sight. The whole book was just a lot of boring marching. And I will agree that book three, aSoS, was by far the most exciting.<br />It was a bit annoying to have books 4 and 5 split by geography. I think aDwD was wonderful to me because the Westerosi aFfC was so much Cersei and Jamie and Brienne I nearly wanted to die by the end. Book 4 was all politics and no action, and while I can appreciate the political aspects of the series, it was like smashing into a brick wall after the excitement of book 3.<br />A Dance With Dragons involves a whole lot of setup, it's true, but it wasn't boring setup. There was a lot of traveling, changing circumstances, and danger. Another reviewer complained that Tyrion never \\"gets anywhere,\\" but that's not true at all. If he just easily arrived at Meereen to support Dany without incident, that would be the equivalent of a happy ending which is completely uncharacteristic of this series. I enjoy the fact that he is thwarted every step of the way, and it's entirely fitting with his character to just go along for the ride and make the best of bad situations.<br />Arya's bits are slower and more tedious in this book, but so is her training. That's the whole point. I would say the same is true for the sparseness of Bran. It conveys that it takes time for them to get where they're going. In Bran's case, he's going to be a major factor later, and it doesn't make sense for him to just instantly arrive at unimaginable power without training.<br />I would say the same goes for Jon, who is still young and learning as he goes in the role of Lord Commander. Despite his lack of action in this book compared with aSoS, there is no shortage of changes taking place on the Wall, and it's all setup for things to come.<br />I found the bits with Reek/Theon and the Boltons to be sufficiently interesting, as was the expanded view of Dorne.<br />The situation in Meereen drew out a little too long, but then, it needed to be just as long as necessary for Dany's dragons to grow to a useful size, really. And Dany, for that matter. You and I know she has no business in Meereen, as do a few of her advisors, but she didn't understand that, and that's kind of the point.

The study and/ or art of time travel might receive more detail in books written by other sci-fi  writers who have physics backgrounds but let's face it, no one can speak as an authority on the subject as it is all just far out speculation. That being said SK gives you enough to make it seem possible (and really this book is not just about time travel). To be truthful it is not just about the JFK assassination either. But it a good blend of love story, JFK, and time travel. This was a good read and kept my attention until the end. I really liked the conclusion and especially the message...be careful what you ask for because you just might get it.  Keith

B0000TB01Y|5.0|When I went and saw this play, it was not with the original cast. But regardless, the music is still amazing and this cd is so perfect. I listen to it all the time. Beautiful songs, beautiful story.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It was a wonderful family movie that encourages a father-daugther realtionship. It points out the importance of family in our lives. it also help to point God's mercy in our lives when we fall down.
B0052U59F4|1.0|i enjoy a romance novel as much as the next but this is a poorly written attempt to write something provocative that gets tongues wagging...of course a movie is in the works...i use to think women \\"had come a long way baby\\" but this book proves me wrong
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I found this device and thought of the hundreds of tapes that I have. I thought for $25.00 what could it hurt so I took a chance. It works as described. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it worked. I got to copying the old favorite music and like a good novel I could not stop. I took a few days to get them all done but the little player only went through 1 set of batteries. I would guess I spent 30 plus hours just playing the tapes and recording. You have to do one song at a time unless you like the whole tap. If you stop it and think the new track that appears will separate the album for you , it don't it mixes them together all at the same time. All in all, very simple to use. It took me about 5 minutes of fiddling with it to be up and running. What a deal. It is a must for anyone with a tape collection. Now for the LPs and 45s. I will have to look for a device for them.
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|Pink Floyd music is made, and was made for surround.  Guthrie could have taken an extra couple days and done a 5.1 mix.
B005CMGKTG|5.0|I was so happy that my Bro saw this on amazon. I ordered it right away.  I have to agree with others that the quality of this picture and the effects rivals many other Big Budget us films.  Guess they really know how to use what they have in Japan.<br /><br />Translation was good (not like some Asian releases in the US) and syntax was correct.  After watching the first run through for the story to watch it a second time for the video was fantastic.<br /><br />Hope they do have a sequel and someone in the US is smart enough to release it theatrically; so much better than the drek coming out of LA over the last 3 years
0393064476|4.0|This, by Mr Greenblatt, is the archetype of the so called \\"popular history\\", which is not bad at all. But if from a book of such nature we expect a good tale about already known historical facts, merchandise which Mr Greenblatt provides very well, nevertheless, for such kind of history book the launching of such ambitious thesis goes too far. If you, as historian, pretend a reinterpretation of known facts, you just develops a full thesis without any concession to entertainment and the tastes and knowledge of general public. So we have here kind of a methodological flaw or inconsequence.<br />Then the thesis in itself, though attractive specially for those that Mr Greenblatt share the idea of Lucretius and Epicure, sound a little bit over inflated. To consider that ONE book, no matter how original, was capable of a full swerve, looks as too much.<br />All said, is a book very interesting to read and deserves to be purchased and swallowed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing! it has games for logic people, action people, and there's tons of games to choose from!! I downloaded it because it was free but its really fun!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this app to be able to access my home computer at lunchtime at work, or when I am away on business. Works very well for that. Screen size can be a problem, but that is not the fault of the app.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I liked this app because of the simple fun that this is.  Five stars for it being free. 99 cents of pure fun.
0439023483|4.0|It took me a long time to jump on the Hunger Games train. I really hate being told by the entire planet that I'm \\"going to love\\" something. Ok, I'm an idiot. These were wonderful. In fact, once I was hooked on the first I bought the other two and finished the series in 3 days.<br /><br />That leads me to the reason for knocking off a star. I'm really happy that I had all three books lined up and ready to go. If I had had to wait a year in between for the next installment to be released, I would have been really angry over the endings of Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Both times I thought that they ended where a chapter should end, not a complete book. Even in a trilogy, the book should tie up some loose ends, leaving a larger, more dramatic story arc to tie the three segments together.<br /><br />If you hated that Lord of the Rings (or as I call it, the Walkin' Walkin' movie) left Frodo and Sam on a cliff (literally) then you're not going to be happy about this one either. Do yourself a favor and buy the boxed set.

B002UZXJA6|5.0|THE OPENING NUMBER IS INCREDIBLE!  I currently own four Celtic Woman dvds and three cds and I want to purchase more new ones as soon as they become available. \\"Songs of the Heart,\\" is my absolute favorite dvd and cd. Not only did the producers include a great selection of songs and singers, but they added many special effects, excellent filming arrangements for \\"Amazing Grace\\"; which by the way was definitely a touch of perfection, and finally the location was ideal. As are the several times, when those beautiful singers created pure harmonic bliss with their voices blended so unbelievably perfectly. Lisa lambe & Chloe Agnew achieved this similar sound also in \\"Walking the Streets\\" in the \\"Believe\\" dvd. The episodes of bliss in \\"Songs From The Heart\\" are beyond perfect. Were it not for the mutual respect among apartment neighbours, I would love to double the volume on songs like \\"The Call,\\" \\"Non C'e Piu,\\" and \\"Nil S' n La\\" so that I could enjoy the full rapture of those great moments.  This quartet of singers is my favorite group because of that marvelous sound that they create when they blend their voices.  Not to be misunderstood, I do very much love ALL of the other singers too. And as for Mairead, she is an angel and she has never disappointed me in any of her performances on all four of my dvds.  Watching this show every day is the best part of my day and I am truly grateful to the producers for making it and I look forward to more \\"HOME RUN\\" videos like this one.

B006KX3GXO|2.0|I really liked the options I had at first glance using this app. But today I received a dialog stating the app was unresponsive and would I like to force close or wait. I didn't want to wait on the app, so I force closed it. Since that moment I have had a blank screen. It's been over an hour and all the troubleshooting I've done hasn't revived my new Kindle fire. Epic Fail :(

B004SBQGHS|1.0|Every time you pause or reset the level it puts ads up. I was at a cafe with wifi that I was not connected to and it would minimize the game and open a browser so that I could accept the agreement from the cafe so it could load the ads.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app has almost everything you're looking for in a notes and indexing tool. although it can still improve more with categorization and indexing, the notes and image annotation and search capability can hold its own with other applications in the market. I also love its price- free!

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I find it to be very helpful. You might ask why and I could say as one reason, that I can check the app before I go to school and see if I should wear a heavy coat or not.  Just a personal opinion.  But I must say, seriously helpful. LOVE THAT APP!!!!!!!!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This was an incredible read. I was hooked from the start. From the main character, Sophia, with her fresh outlook, to the well-rounded secondary characters, they grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  Rebecca Hamilton has created a wonderful world with known and new creatures. Whatever I expected, The Forever Girl blew my expectations. I loved it and can't wait for more!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app to keep me grounded and I like the share to Facebook feature. I recommend it to anyone.
B006HL9G10|5.0|It's a timer app with cool bells. I love it. The pre-timer was an excellent idea. Graphically it could be nicer looking. But that's just me being picky.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its a great Bible, for reading or even better it reads it to you while you sit back and listen.
B000EXZH5G|5.0|Many times we try to relive our younger years by getting back into the music we were listening to at the time.  In this case......it works spectacularly.  This album stil is outstanding.  Dinosaur Jr remains one of my favorites, and their new albums cement their place among the greats.  It's great to hear this again, and it sounds as good as ever.
1416955070|5.0|I FREAKING love this book!! I like all the characters, love the action and the story and the heartbreaking love! This book was absolutely fantastic! It had the perfect amount of thrilling adventure and humor and emotional moments to keep me going from beginning till end!<br /><br />Clary, for how ordinary her life had been, took everything really well. She was courageous and kind girl who I can easily relate to, especially when she mentions something DD or anime related! She's not super kick-ass yet, but she was still really brave in facing all the obstacles and smart in finding where the Mortal Cup was.<br /><br />Jace, you make my heart sing! Your sarcasm and wit were truly a thing of legend. I lost count the number of times you made me laugh and even shed a tear or two near the end. I love how Cassandra Clare showed us how lovable and attractive Jace is (through other ppl attempting to engage him), instead of just telling us over over again.<br /><br />I love how Clary and Jace slowly grew close together. There was no cheesy insta-love in this story! Oh yay! Finally! Anyway, they were two people thrown together by circumstances. Yes, Jace was a bit curious about Clary in the beginning, but who wouldn't be? But he didn't spout cheesy lines like she was special or something, but their feelings were clearly shown through their actions and words! Nothing was ever really said, but as a reader I knew their feelings and sympathized for them. I love how this was done!<br /><br />As for all the secondary characters, I love Simon the most of course. The scene with the Greater Demon Abbadon and Simon absolutely made me swoon. Yay Brains over Brawns! Alec and Isabelle are both super likeable. Alec's inner struggle touched me and through him I also came to love and understand Jace even better. All the secondary characters made a great cast in this book!<br /><br />Now for the plot. It was truly non-stop action. Half the time I couldn't turn the page fast enough to find out what's going to happen. The pacing was perfect, with character development interweaved seamlessly into the action. We really got to know Clary through her actions, not endless inner reflections and broodiness like in a lot of YA I read recently. Not for a moment did I lose interest in the book. Near the end was an emotional rollercoaster that made me cry a little (maybe a tear or two). I cursed my busy schedule and midterm season for making me stay away from this book every time I had to put it down!<br /><br />Lastly, the writing was terrific. Cassandra Clare had a way with words that transported me from my room to New York. I was with Clary all the way through her journey. I could picture every scene clearly in my head and be totally immersed in the atmosphere that the author had set for the scene. It was a darker New York than the real one, but the Shadow World came to life and I was a part of it.<br /><br />A fabulous book that is 100% worth the hype!<br /><br />Rating: 5/5!!!!!!<br /><br />Note: I will not say anything about Jace and Clary's relationship because I'm hoping that Cassandra Clare has something else up her sleeve to change the situation! Oh, and I noticed the similarities to Harry Potter. It's hard not to, but still, it was such a good story! Besides, it has fewer similarities to Harry Potter than some other YA books that are basically Twilight!<br /><br />Ning @ Reading by Kindle Fire
B00006D295|2.0|It was very easy to order this movie from Amazon, though it took over six days to receive it even though I was told it would ship the next day. When I played the disk it froze every time I wanted to use the scene location feature. I needed that feature as I'm working with a chorus and we are singing some of the songs from Rocky Horror. The whole reason I ordered this video was because I wanted to learn select songs from it. Unfortunately, I have to fast forward each time to whatever I want to hear.
042524489X|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to read this after reading the previous book in the series. This is by far one of my favorite paranormal romance series of all time! We've all see the interaction and attraction between Hawke and Sienna earlier in the series. Well, finally, it's their story! I was a bit worried about how Nalini Singh will take care of the age difference, but I shouldn't have been worried. It was done amazingly.<br /><br />If you want the short version, well, I LOVE IT! Nalini Singh couldn't have done a better job in writing this long-awaited story between the alpha of SnowDancer and Sienna Lauren.<br /><br />I love Hawke! He's the perfect alpha male. Loyal and generous and strong, he is the heart of his pack, having become an alpha at a young age and rebuilt SnowDancer from the brink of destruction. After the death of his mate, he never thought he'd find anyone again. Until Sienna, beautiful and aggravating Sienna who tested his patience at every turn. Honestly, I want to pet Hawke! He's so totally swoon-worthy that I never get tired of reading about him! And he's the alpha male without the bullying tendency. He's used to getting what he wants, but he finds it fascinating that Sienna dares to stand up to him.<br /><br />As for Sienna, having grown up in Silence, it surprised me just how loving she was. Though she was only nineteen, she'd see and done enough in her life to have the heart and mind of someone much older. Nalini Singh has such a way of writing heroines that I sympathize with. In the last few books, every heroine basically broke my heart, and Sienna is no exception. First, there's the helplessness she felt at her almost impossible relationship with Hawke. Then, there's the problem of her destructive powers that she had no way of surviving. As always, Nalini Singh had me on the edge of my seat wondering what solutions she had at the end of book to solve our heroine's problems.<br /><br />This book totally led me on an emotional roller-coaster ride, not only with Hawke and Sienna, but with the rest of the characters as well. I love the amount of time the author spent on building up the relationships so that we come to care about every single character. Here's a quote that spoke perfectly of how I fell in love with each and every character:<br /><br />\\"A single instinctive thought and the strength of his men and women flowed into him through the alpha-lieutenant blood bonds. Indigo's incredible heart, Riley's solid loyalty, Matthia's quiet determination, Riaz's intensity, Alexei's barely tempered power, Cooper's stubborn tenacity, Jem's wildfire, Kenji's calm will, Tomas's energetic wildness.\\"<br /><br />The way she summed up the characters was just beautiful.<br /><br />Lastly, the backstory and the war were merged seamlessly into the story line so that it didn't take away from the romance at all but rather enhanced it, made it more real. The ending was also totally believable. Nalini Singh didn't leave out one detail, and because the way the story was built, the ending didn't feel contrived like it just popped out of thin air. Rather, it flowed naturally from the rest of the story.<br /><br />As always, whenever I love a book this much, there aren't enough good things I can say about it. Just that - go out and get it! I hope you love it as much as I do!<br /><br />Ning @ Reading by Kindle Fire
B005R5U5B2|5.0|Up All Night by One direction is a brilLiam CD filled with fabLouis music.  These 5 lads started out as solo artists on the 'X-Factor' in Britain. One of the judges suggested they join forces and become a 'band'. The finished the 'X-Factor' in 3rd place and are now the most popular boy band in the world. They have had a UK tour, are currently on tour in the US with 'Big Time Rush', and in their 2013 tour is already sold out!<br /><br />This CD is filled with catchy tunes, amaZayn vocals, & Beautiful lyrics.  Their talent & skill is only part of what them phenomeNiall. Other keys to what makes them so popular and lovable are: their personalities that are evident in all of their songs and seen in their Videos, their love for what they do, and their love and care for everyone in their fandom.<br /><br />I definitely recommend getting this CD.

1595141979|4.0|This book started kind of slow for me, but like the others, once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. I like Rose a lot better in this book. I think she might actually be growing up a little, or maybe just growing on me. After seeing one of her best friends die, she changed. She's still smart-mouthed and tough as usual, but she's grown up after facing the real world.<br /><br />While the book was action-packed, it was really predictable. I understood what was happening to Rose basically immediately (why she could see ghost and all that), but it was annoying that no one else did, and everyone refused to listen to her, so I just wanted to hit someone until they did. It was a good plot device, otherwise the book would be so much shorter, but it was so blatant and frustrating that everyone was so stupid that I just couldn't stand it!<br /><br />I can't say it's not a teenager drama fest, because it is, but the good thing was that it didn't overwhelm the plot of the book. Yes, the book ended on a huge cliffhanger, but at least the book is self-contained. After reading books that didn't even have a climax and all the first book does is building up the story for later books, I have a new appreciation for these series books where the author actually gives each book a self-contained story without sacrificing the overall series plot!<br /><br />Oh, and I'm finally getting to the epic romance between Rose and Dimitri, right? Well, don't tell me. I'll read the next one to find out!<br /><br />Rating: 4/5
B005PR2FD8|4.0|I love the 3D graphics, realism, characters, locations, and so. Like everyone else, I would find this movie interesting and worth watching at first. But, when you see the plot, nonsense (e.g. Lee's catchphrase \\"Excellent\\"), irrelevance of some things, and limited characters from the entire Tekken series, you realize that this entire movie is just incomplete. It is supposed to be much better than the real live action film \\"Tekken\\" made in 2010. But, it is honestly no different than that lousy and previous one (Jin and Christie are a couple in that movie but they are not even friends in the video game series.).<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0053OMTVQ Tekken Hybrid]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006KYYP06 Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0057PERH0 Tekken 3D Prime Edition]]

B005FVFWOI|5.0|Hello, my name is Martin and I am a Jethro Tull addict. Yup, like so many others here I found this music in high school, latched firmly onto it, bought all the vinyl albums, went to as many concerts as I could. Then when technology advanced I started to hunt down and grab the CDs as they came out. Unfortunately, I found the early CDs somewhat lacking. There just seemed to be something missing as compared to the old vinyl, and some the the CD mixes seemed rather flat, hollow, almost lifeless.<br /><br />Then along came the various and sundry original recordings remastered, extra tracks, etc, and the sound quality definitely improved - a lot in fact. Nonetheless, I had my share of doubts that yet another release of Aqualung could be worth the coin. After all, what more could Ian have pulled from his dusty treasure trove of old master tapes that hadn't already been extracted?<br /><br />Now for the good news - this 40th Anniversary release is nothing short of phenomenal. I could not believe my ears! The clarity and sonic detail is simply wonderful!  To make sure I wasn't imagining it I had to jump back and forth between the 1999 \\"Original Recording Reissued, Extra Tracks\\" version and this one track-by-track and yes it is true; there is so much more to hear in the 2011 version. Words cannot convey, you simply have to put on your headphones and have a listen for yourselves! You won't be disappointed.

B006VSBAKE|5.0|Each segment of the Castle series is adorable, even the more serious ones.  I love all the cast and the writers are excellent.  I really love it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I had stopped reading his books for many years but was happy to read in this one all the things which had hooked me as a fan years before. The writing and story telling are at his best.  Although still with a sci-fi  angle, there are so many great stories within it which in themselves would stand alone.  You may think you can see the end coming, but you will be wrong. You won't be able tp put the last 100 pages down until you are done.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game, I had never played Angry Birds before.  Lots of fun.  The pop up ads are not too annoying, once play starts they disappear.  Got the Angry Birds Seasons next since this one was so much fun.  Very challenging too.  I loved it.

B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this for my 11 year old daughter who got a kindle fire for Christmas. Her favorite color is purple so needless to say she loved it. The product has been holding up extremely well so far.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This device is easy to use.  I am using it with a 16 GB card that I put music onto, and it sounds great through my truck stereo.  I am using it with the wired set up.  Remote control is very nice to have.  Nice display to see what is playing and many features for playback.  I leave it in my vehicle, and it starts up automatically when I start the engine.  However, you must turn it off manually when finished or else unplug it from the cigarette lighter.  It comes out a bit hard, plus I was afraid of damaging it as the device is hooked directly to the plug in - so I opted to turn the device off manually.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|I really like that I can access from my phone or another computer, my main computer at home and check on my financial stuff especially.  It does not come with very clear directions, so it's sort of trial and error to get it to work.  I have tried other remote control products and so far, this one is the best.  I do have only the free edition right now, but I might eventually buy the total package.

B006IND5M8|4.0|You get pretty much exactly what you expect with this movie.  There are cowboys and there are aliens.  And explosions.  Not exactly a masterpiece, but it's a fun action movie.
B004SBQAN8|2.0|The book was decent, though the plot could be described as \\"my girlfriend is more important than the universe itself\\".<br />The movie was so terrible! They should have called it \\"I am Number Six\\" because that was what the movie was about. The characters were all blonde (except Sam. Yay Sam!) Henri was a creep. The dog was a creep. Number Six was a creep.<br />I actually liked John and his girlfriend though. They got together wayyyy too fast, but it was still okay.<br />I find it funny, during the party scene where John goes to get his girlfriend, the sherriff walks through the party (where all the kids are drinking, as mentioned later by the Mogdorian who says \\"a drunk young man like you\\") and doesn't even say anything about the kids being underage, or having a party in his house, which, by the way, in the book, was a secret party because the bully's parents were out of town. (The house got burned down in the book. Yeah. That was kind of a big part.)<br />That's just it. The kids did not look like highschoolers.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />Henri died way too early. He dies during the battle at the school. And actually, most of the fighting with the beasts took place outside the school. In the forest and whatever.<br />END SPOILER<br /><br />The only redeeming thing in this movie was Sam, for one thing, and the floor polisher. That's like the one thing that didn't change from the book. What the HECK was up with those \\"Mogs\\", which, by the way, they were never referred to as in the book.<br />Their powers were all wrong. ALL wrong. Is Six Nightcrawler now? Her power is invisibility. It's John that is resistant to heat. What was up with his Lumen?<br /><br />The book wasn't great. The movie was awful. The author is going to get a big head and this is going to turn out Hunger Games/Transformers (\\"I know it's not my fight\\" - Sam &lt;- LOL!)/ Maximum Ride.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Okay so, at first I wasn't sure where the ending was going but when it was over I felt every emotion and I actually shed  a few tears at the end, partly because it was such a good ending and partly because the story was over. I love how it wasn't the typical happy ending, instead it was a believable, satisfying, realistic ending with losses and gains. So now I will look forward to the movies!
1423140591|4.0|This book seemed kind of...childish to me. I'm not sure if it's because I'm getting old or what, but it felt a little juvenile and formulaic. The whole book was building up to the giants, and then they were kind of lame. Random stuff (like Ella, the stick thing, \\"free samples\\") kept happening as nods to Roman mythology or just as gags. Kind of fun, but a little trying after a while. I also don't know if I can keep up with all these characters. Hazel is stuck in the past, Frank is unsure of himself, Percy is a seasoned, sarcastic hero, Reyna is a deadly warrior, Athena is smart and deadly, Jason is exactly like Percy, Piper has a crush on Jason, and Leo is cute and tech-savvy. And they're all pawns for Gaea. Haven't we done this before, gods and mortals working together? Hm...I'm going to go read the third Kane Chronicles...<br /><br />Not much is new. We had this big battle, like the one in The Last Olympian, and it was meh. Were there really any climatic battles in the first few Percy Jackson books? Probably, I just forget.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this book was still a fun, rollicking good time and adventurous romp. Clean, funny, with a great pace, Percy Jackson is always great quality writing.<br /><br />I need to stop reading these lit-heavy books for my English class and get back to the good stuff. =)<br /><br />PS- The Amazons made me think of Wonder Woman =)<br />PPS- Harry Potter had a lot of Roman mythology in it. Minerva (Roman goddess of wisdom), Sibyl (Roman prophetess). Hm?
0062059882|3.0|Ehhh.<br /><br />Didn't have that couldn't-put-it-down feel, like I experienced with Martin's Ice & Fire series or Rothfuss' Kingkiller series.<br /><br />The protagonist, Shadow, was likeable, and the peeks into the netherworld were somewhat interesting.  Most scenery in the book, however, was cold, gray, and boring.  And I don't recall laughing once.<br /><br />My fundamental problem with the book was the nature of the gods themselves, i.e., petty, quasi-normal, vulnerable, and relatively-weak individuals that exist only because of the beliefs and sacrafices of those who worship them.  I prefer my gods to be noble, all powerful, awe-inspiring, eternal, and formed from the stuff that made the cosmos.
0439023491|2.0|Against my earlier wishes, I decided to once again try the sequel to Hunger Games. I love Suzanne Collins as a writer. She captured my heart (and childhood) with Gregor the Overlander. Hunger Games was amazing, but nothing unique (as in Uglies, Maze Runner, anything by Neal Shusterfield), and intense. I liked it, I really did. It was my second dystopian novel I had ever read (the complex and awesome Uglies being the first), and I liked the depth and dark.<br /><br />I will be reading the last two books in the series so I can \\"informedly\\" evaluate the Hunger Games movie in March. The first time I tried to read Catching Fire, I was not impressed with the romance triangle and contrived political intrigue. I felt as if Suzanne's publisher forced her to end the first book the way she did to make way for two unnecessary money-making sequels. I feel as if the series could have ended quite solidly with the stand-alone, amazing Hunger Games. The world seems to disagree with me.<br /><br />The rest of this review is about the plot, so don't read this if you don't want spoilers! =)<br /><br />I read the entire book in one day. I had one false start on this story a while ago, but, as I've said, I decided to give it another chance.<br />The first third of this book is infuriatingly tedious, the middle is a repeat of the first book, and the very is end is kind of what you expected during the entire book, but the reveal is atrocious.<br /><br />That being said, I dislike Katniss. Sure she's human- selfish, afraid, unsure of what she wants- but it gets so darn annoying. I feel like Peeta is the real hero in this story- no joke! He has all the appropriate qualities and is generally a really great guy. He's also talented, nice to a fault, and knows exactly what words to say.<br /><br />The first part of this book is all about parties, food and dresses in extreme detail. There's a little bit of what I guess you could call \\"government intrigue\\", but none of it is paced very well. Snow is just pathetic, really. \\"I know about the kiss.\\" What? What kind of bad guy would use that closing line? How terrifying! Not. You already knows he watches your every move. The only reason he said this was so Katniss could smell the blood on his breath. He should have just said \\"good luck\\" or something. \\"I know about...\\" pfht!<br /><br />The clock was pretty cool, but the Games went by so fast in comparison to the stupid wedding dress shoot and stuff.  I totally knew the part with Cinna was coming up, that was well played. As well as the jabberjay scene. As soon as, um, whatever his name is- the guy who is in charge of the games now- showed Katniss his watch, I was like BOOM! Rebel.<br /><br />There was a lot that could have been done with the various characters in the Games with Katniss. Most of them were pretty interesting, and the Games could have gone on longer.<br /><br />Too much time in this book was wasted on descriptions of Katniss' dresses and her back-and-forth with her guys. I didn't mind the guys too much, Gale and Peeta are both great. Those scenes were crafted pretty well, so as not to be annoying. Though Peeta and Katniss sleeping together was kind of unnecessary, though understandable to further the plot and stuff.<br /><br />I actually understand the romantic feelings all three of them have, and Katniss' confusion. Hopefully that will get cleared up in Mockingjay, and she and Gale will finally be together, and Peeta will be the ruler of a new nation and get together with Madge or Prim or someone that at least deserves him.is just pathetic, really. \\"I know about the kiss.\\" What?

B00466HN6S|1.0|On March 23, 2012, Universal Pictures will release the Easter-themed film, Hop, on Blu-ray and DVD. Although some hail Hop as a family-friendly Easter classic, the message of this film is something far more insidious. Akin to the worst examples of racial and ethnic stereotyping found in twentieth century film, the not-so-subtle message of Hop is that those who speak with a \\"Spanish\\" dialect do not count in American society. Put another way, Hop depicts Hispanics as deluded and dangerous for believing that they can ascend to a position of employment beyond that of menial labor.<br /><br />Despite public controversy surrounding the film's initial release on April 1, 2011, Universal Pictures has decided to move ahead with a home video release of the film that they describe as a \\"comic tale\\" that blends \\"state-of-the-art animation with live action.\\" Universal's cheerful press description omits the offensive subplot that revolves around the actions of Carlos (Hank Azaria), a possible heir to the Easter Bunny mantle.<br /><br />In fact, the majority of the press about the film ignores the Carlos character and instead dwells on the relationship between EB and Fred O'Hare. EB (Russell Brand) is the son of the retiring Easter Bunny. Unwilling to follow in his father's footsteps, EB flees to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a rock drummer. Back in the live-action world, the audience meets Fred O'Hare (James Marsden), the unambitious and irresponsible son of Henry O'Hare (Gary Cole). Despite his pattern of unreliability, Fred gets the opportunity to housesit a multi-million dollar home. Predictably, Fred encounters and injures runaway EB. \\"Hilarity\\" ensues as EB ransacks the home, plays his rock drums, and slowly wins the friendship of Fred.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the picture is much less rosy in the animated Easter world. EB's father is beside himself with worry about his missing son and fears that he will have to cancel Easter. Carlos, a loyal factory supervisor, steps forward to offer his assistance to EB's father. He articulates a compelling case for why, in the absence of EB, he should become the next Easter Bunny. After all, he has worked in the factory for years, knows the entire production process, and is familiar to the workers. EB's father scoffs at the idea and informs him that a chicken can never become the Easter Bunny.<br /><br />Regardless of his tireless loyalty and ample qualifications, Hop boldly ridicules even the suggestion that \\"Carlos\\" can become the Easter Bunny. Admittedly, it would not seem racist, or even far-fetched, to suggest that the Easter Bunny should in fact be a bunny. However, the consistent negative portrayal of Carlos and the film's denouement ultimately reveal the true reason Carlos cannot become the Easter Bunny: his ethnicity.<br /><br />Inexplicably, the filmmakers choose to racialize the character of Carlos. Throughout the film, Carlos speaks in broken English with a strong mock-Spanish dialect. Imagine how this film might have been received had the Carlos character been renamed \\"Chang\\" and unable to discern his \\"Rs\\" from his \\"Ls.\\" Likewise, what if he had been named \\"Darius\\" and spoke with a mock, African-American dialect?<br /><br />Hop doubles down on persisting stereotypes of Hispanics in American film and television. First, Carlos is not depicted simply owning or transporting chickens (as is often the case in American television and film), he literally is a chicken, or more precisely, un pollito. Second, his broken English and mixed metaphors encourage the audience to laugh at and mock him. Consequently, the film reinforces the belief that Mexicans who speak English with a thick accent are somehow stupid, unqualified, or a joke.<br /><br />Sadly, the film dashes the viewer's hope that the negative portrayal of Carlos is actually somehow subversive. Replete with weaponry and violence, Carlos leads a failed Che Guevara-style revolution at the factory that ultimately leaves him disfigured. Banished, Carlos leaves his chick henchmen to toil in the factory with no hope of a better life. Ironically, the film then playfully resolves by declaring the conspicuously human Fred O'Hare \\"co-Easter Bunny.\\" The audience is left to ponder why this entitled, untalented, lazy, white twenty-something is more qualified to be Easter Bunny than the loyal and hardworking Carlos.<br /><br />Hop is disturbing for what it reveals about Universal Pictures and American culture more generally. It suggests that Universal Pictures, or at the very least the production team of Hop, involved very few culturally aware individuals in positions of authority. The racial subtext of this film is glaringly evident for anyone who has even tangentially experienced discrimination based on race, class, religion, gender, or sexual preference. Secondly, it suggests that American consumers are blind to, or perhaps even comfortable with, the negative portrayals of Hispanics advanced in American television and film today. As consumers, we need to relegate Hop to the dustbin of history alongside decaying reels containing the faces of Charlie Chan and Uncle Remus.
0525478817|5.0|This is probably more a book for teens than adults but, as an adult, I really enjoyed it.  It was a real account of a teenager living with late-stage cancer and all its difficulties.  However, although I anticipated that it would tug at my heart strings and become sappy, it didn't.  In fact, a lot of it was pretty funny.  I loved that the main characters acted like teenagers even though, in some respects, they had to face some very grown up issues. I highly recommend this book.  Great writing, very engaging.  Look for more from John Green!
0316044695|4.0|***** Spoilers for those not familiar with Operation Red Wings *****<br /><br />Lone Survivor is a tough book to review.  As a thriller, based on a true story, it would have been a five star.  There are some truly fascinating parts that make it impossible to put down.  It is also a very emotional read. The outcome of operation Red Wings (as in, Detroit's hockey team, note the inaccurate title of the book) was all too real.  On June 28, 2005, our country lost 19 of its best sons in some g-d forsaken hell hole, far away from home.  This fact, remains at the forefront of the reader's mind from the first to the last page of the book, and much much longer after that.<br /><br />Having said that, Lone Survivor is presented by the publisher and the ghost writer as a historical account.  It is not.  Quite frankly, I think there is a good chance that Marcus L. never read it before it was printed.  Without giving away specific spoilers, this book contains numerous glaring inaccuracies and exaggerations contradicted by authoritative sources, including Marcus' own After Action Report.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is a critical passage describing Michael Murphy (google: \\"Michael Murphy Medal of Honor\\") offering up for a vote a decision on whether to kill unarmed civilians.  For this, the book has been widely criticized by the SF/SO community as well as Michael's dad.<br /><br />Overall, a wasted opportunity - would have been good to read Marcus' account without having it ruined by the publisher.  Also, it is insulting to the men who lost their lives, that it was deemed necessary to dramatize the actual firefight, as if describing it how it is believed to have really happened would have made it less heroic.<br /><br />Still recommended, as it is a good book, just understand what it is not.

0307957934|3.0|In Robert Harris's \\"The Fear Index,\\" a novel overflowing with financial flotsam, financier Hugo Quarry explains to the mathematician Alex Hoffman what a hedge fund is by using a literally colorful, slightly naughty analogy (p. 177).  Okay, so now I get hedge funds--but what about the rest of the jargon?  This financial idiot knows, at least, that something is happening in the story that is both very good (huge profits) and very bad (less hedging of bets) at the same time.  Is that enough?<br /><br />Financial complexities aside, the book's relatively simple plot moves along fairly quickly.  There aren't any hairpin or corkscrew turns to keep the reader guessing. There's only the basic question of Dr. Hoffman's sanity: if he's crazy, then what we're reading may be happening at least mainly in the brain; if he's sane, then there has to be an another explanation for the strange goings on.  It's not an unusual premise for a novel, but it's not a bad one, either.  For the reader informed by such sci-fi film classics as \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) and B-movie guilty pleasures like \\"Colossus: The Forbin Project\\" (1970) it doesn't take very long to figure out what's going on.  At that point, it's just a matter of seeing how the author plays it out.<br /><br />Although much is made of his financial algorithms, Dr. Hoffman's research interests lie in artificial intelligence.  The author reveals little about Hoffman's work.  When things start going to hell, you begin to wonder how really good Hoffman is in this field.  After all, when a software glitch creates havoc, Hoffman's response is a hardware solution.  Really?  Would Hoffman be just like me when my computer freezes up?  Would he just reboot?  Moreover, Hoffman's prize program is remarkably one dimensional--come to think of it, much like Hoffman himself, or, even better, like Audrey II in \\"The Little Shop of Horrors.\\"<br /><br />The novel is mildly entertaining, which may be damning it with faint praise.  The style is more literary than what you'd expect in a potboiler.  There is the occasional moment that strains credulity, such as when Hoffman is lured into a trap, calls the police only at the last, worse possible time--and then finds his cell phone doesn't work.  The guy literally has a billion dollars to his name but is undone by having no bars.<br /><br />The reader also has the sense that maybe this book is supposed to be about something, but what?  The potential dangers of artificial intelligence?  The chasm between the 99 and one percent?  The maddening nature of the arcane financial world?  Alas, no matter.  \\"The Fear Index\\" will make an airplane journey cross-country pass less painfully.  I just tried it and it worked--but I suspect Harris can do better.s more literary than what you'd expect in a potboiler.

B004W2UBYW|3.0|While it was fascinating to learn about Steve Jobs and his quirky brilliance, this book felt like it was written in a hurry. The narrative is not in chronological order, and the author frequently switches timeframes with no explanation. It feels like he had a bunch of good stories, and just appended one to the other and published the book. I wanted him to build a picture of Steve Jobs - the genius, the creative force, the son and brother and husband and father, the man wrestling with a devastating illness. In the end, the reader is left to piece together an image of Jobs, and left guessing how all the pieces fit together.<br /><br />In addition, there are numerous misspellings, grammar errors, and missing words in the Kindle edition (perhaps in the hardcover too?).

B0060AY6FO|1.0|Why even use Elizabeth and Darcy to tell a pointless, mediocre murder mystery? No romance, a thin plot that doesn't even INVOLVE any character that a reader would care about (Wickham? Please! Who cares if he hangs?), in which no one changes, learns anything or grows in any way whatsoever. Probably the most pointless book I've ever read. Except maybe the sequel someone banged out to Jane Eyre a few years ago... what was that called? Mrs. Rochester? That was every bit as snooze-worthy. And you can tell I'm a Bronte/Austen fan because I actually BOUGHT and READ both of these travesties. Ugh.

Written young-adult style, with a fast-paced style that leaps disarmingly from plot point to plot point with little time for elaboration.

Perhaps it was the reader's high from the excitement of the first book, and the somewhat unsatisfactory resolution of the relationship arc.

B006OAB3ME|2.0|I heard his performance of Valentine on the Grammy's and although Sinatra's voce still sounded good into his late 70's, it was uncomfortable to listen to this great one stumble.  I did like the song itself and teaming with Krall was a smart choice.  I kept seeing the cute one on the Starbucks counter and after about 3 weeks, I thought aw heck! Remember the joy of hearing a new Beatles album back in the day?<br />Back home I poured a glass of wine, lit a candle, settled in to give a listen.  Not good.  I have heard him live last year and he was great, it was also an arena and lots of music and a back up singer or two to help him.  Now, his voice is weak and trembly.  I quit listening at cut 8 and have not gone back.  Valentine was the best, and expectedly, this studio version was much better than the live Grammy's.<br />Liking one song on a McCartney CD?  Wow.<br />Thinking about Mr Lennon, and what might have been......  would guess that he would have accepted his limited timbre and pitch in old age.  He would have utilized some youngsters to get his music across.

B0041KKYGU|1.0|I thought this movie was going to be a little funny.  Boy was I wrong.  I probably did not watch fifteen minutes of this mess of a movie.  Too much profanity for starters.  Cameron Diaz character from the jump start did not show much promise.  They protrayed her as a gold digging foul mouthed user of men and people. The things some people do for money. Eventually, her foul mouth and acting made it hard for me to watch the movie any further.<br /><br />If I could, I would have given her 1/2 a star.

B0052U59F4|3.0|I was interested in reading this book after a friend recommended it but with hindsight I'm fairly sure she just enjoyed it because it was full of kinky sex! The basic plot could have been ripped straight from a mills & boon book but then given to a group of slightly mixed up, sexual deviants to polish it off and turn it into something only fit for the adult market. Now I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it but I found the main character a little annoying. Suddenly she goes from Miss sweet and innocent to being in love with this millionaire with serious baggage and an inability to have a normal relationship without sexual pain. It left a slightly icky taste in my mouth when she was willing to do so much simply to please him and only in a book can that be good for a relationship. They say that love knows no boundaries but sometimes I think loosing oneself and ones sense of self worth for another person can only be negative.<br /><br />If you wish to have a much lighter and less intense read why not try [[ASIN:B007FAK2OC GODS OF MEN (Children of the Apocalypse)]]?
0061733199|5.0|Wow! This book astonished me: from the honesty to its intensity, this is an in-depth look at how to survive any situation in any climate. Though, I don't think I could kill my own game to eat; I'd probably revert to being a vegan, the information from how to trap to how to prep it is in there. And should I need to eat weeds and nuts, there are full color photos on the safe ones to eat and those to avoid, including those dangerous bugs and reptiles to avoid.<br />He provides you with information on how to put together a survival kit and a survival pouch. With these few items one puts together, one can surive anywhere, anytime.<br />It is a thick book and I'm still working my way through it, but I highly recommend it for reference. I sincerely hope I nor anyone else never needs to rely on it, but in these days of the increasing frequency and strength of natural and man-made disasters, one never knows.

B000003TA4|5.0|Like most hardcore Nirvana fans, I have a love/hate relationship with NEVERMIND. On the one hand, this is, from start to finish, a fantastic album and one of the most influential of all time (certainly the most influential of the 90s). Melodic, catchy, quiet tunes like COME AS YOU ARE and SOMETHING IN THE WAY coexist with classic punk rock songs like BREED, STAY AWAY and the legendary SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT. There are few albums that are more catchy and fun to listen to than this is.<br /><br />But that's the thing-as fun as it is to listen to, it just doesn't feel like Nirvana at times. Nirvana isn't always about singing along at parties; it's about listening to screaming guitar feedback and Kurt's haunting voice, being hypnotized. Kurt sounds great here, but he and the band in general feel \\"neutered,\\" so to speak-everything feels a little *too* perfect, and I personally feel that this album is the least of Nirvana's three studio offerings.<br /><br />But that isn't to say this is a bad album-even without the stripped down, unpolished feeling of BLEACH, the energy still pervades this album, and you can still \\"feel\\" the emotion on songs like LITHIUM and DRAIN YOU. Overall, this album is great, even if it does overshadow Nirvana's other work (which, in my opinion, is far superior).

B000003TAR|5.0|I'm always dismayed when I hear people say they love Nirvana but whose obsession with them begins and ends with Nevermind. Don't get me wrong, Nevermind is a great record, but there's always a sense of polished, refined rock coming from it. That's not to say that polished rock is bad rock, but Nirvana was at their best when they forsaked it. And they are at their best on IN UTERO.<br /><br />Here is an album with the raw, screeching, guttural feedback of BLEACH and the high budget of NEVERMIND to make sure that it sounds as good as possible. But the high budget doesn't make this album sound cleaner; if anything, it sounds as raw as, if not more so, than BLEACH. You can hear Kurt's screams of pain in MILK IT, his resigned indignation to fame in ALL APOLOGIES, and his blissful indifference in DUMB. This record does something special-with a high budget, it manages to get to the core of the music, to the true essence of the emotions of the singer behind it. A lesser band would have squandered this by hiding behind autotune or incomprehensible electric sounds. Nirvana, on the other hand, paradoxically manages to create an album that sounds less refined and packaged than their $600 dollar debut album. That's something that is very hard to do, but they manage to do it and then some.<br /><br />Overall, I can't praise IN UTERO enough. I've yet to come across an album as diverse (DUMB and TOURETTE'S are probably some of the most completely different sounding songs on any single record), raw, and flat out powerful as this one is. It's my personal all-time favorite album, and maybe it always will be.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|J Dilla is the greatest producer in hip-hop history.  This is the most original hip hop album of all time.  Each song has its own unique mood, and tells its own story through the different samples that Dilla was so great at doing.  This is a must have for any die hard hip hop fan.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very fun.  First game ever that I was able to finish.  Some levels took me a long time but you can Google hints.  I probably will buy games in the future to avoid ads, but it was my first game app.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|When all said and done, I am not dissatisfied.  I wanted a cheap alternative to buying each season's box set individually (for a lot more money I might add), and this was it.  I was afraid of the early reviews that said the DVDs wouldn't play or were missing, but I've not had that problem.  Could use better thought out packaging, yes, could use more extra footage if you're going to BUY it rather than watch reruns on tv for free, yes.  But all in all it accomplished what I wanted... I get to see the entire run, with the fragments that were cut out for time during original airing still in place, without commercials, and in sequence.  I was about the same age as the characters when they were on the air, so watching it is like going home again in some ways.  I read the bad reviews and took the risk of buying it anyway... SO totally worth it.<br /><br />**EDIT** I've just finished the whole set.  The gag reel DVD only has seasons 1-4 and 10 on it... have to resort to looking the rest up online I guess.  Everything played on my pc but there were a few random issues while watching them on a bluray player.  Still worth the money, but could've been a little more inclusive.
1400052181|5.0|Great book I loved it!  Couldn't stop talking about it. I even found out that it was required reading for some graduate students.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its a very fun and interesting game I love it also. it is hard at first then you get the hang of it
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love this game, but twice now I have had all my game data disappear after I restart the game after getting intrupted by a phone call. Both times I had the adventure mode beaten and many of the trophies. Please fix so I don't have to start from scratch every time someone calls me!
B0064ORVCQ|2.0|I quit watching this half way thru,I found it boring,and the 3d effects were minimal at best.It almost looked like 2d,the 3d was that bad.If your looking for a good movie,with good 3d,pass on this one.
1603400265|5.0|This is a awesome book. I like the fast pace of the story. This book is so great that I had a hard time putting it down, so I finished it in a bout one day. I think that this book is way better than the Pirates of the Caribbean series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|well, i would say best series ever, but that belongs to Harry Potter. it cuts a close second though. it keeps you hanging on the entire time. the end of the books have the best cliff hangers and you literally cannot wait to start the next one. i read all three books in like three days. i didnt want to even leave my kindle for work, i just wanted to read! great plot line, i think the movie will be really good.

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|The dexterity in my fingers may not be as good as say, a small Chinese woman but actually getting the battery in its compartment without bending the spring required holding the spring back with a small penknife blade while my son pushed the battery into its compartment. And besides that, between ordering and receiving the microphone the price dropped significantly. And if there is one thing that will cause me to boycott all products from a company or seller it would be selling a marginal product at one price and then for no apparent reason other than the bad press it is getting drop the price.

1451627289|5.0|Let me start by saying that this the second book I have read by Stephen King and I did not like the first one. The plot concept intrigued me, and based on the glowing review from the NYT, I decided to give it a try. Boy was I glad I did! This is clearly one of the best books I have read in the last several years. The plot summary: A high school teacher from Maine discovers a portal in time back to September 1958 and decides to try and stop the Kennedy assassination. This book is so well written. The character development is excellent. The plotting is so intricate that your mind is always fully engaged. You will be entertained and intrigued to the very final page. This is a GREAT READ!!!<br /><br />Also, be sure to read the afterword. Mr. King talks about how he came to write this book.
B000L212HW|3.0|What a shame. This movie came so close to being awesome. I'd say the first half of this movie had all the elements to make it a classic B-movie. The effects are amazing. The dragon lore is great. Its like Jaws with dragons. Even Matthew McCaughey was pretty good and could have been a classic film badass. Unfortunately, I think the (lack of)budget showed and too many cooks in the kitchen derailed the second half. The budget could not support large scale dragon vs tank battles so it was a much smaller movie. That could have worked, much like Terminator or Jaws, but the characters are just not developed enough to support a more intimate film. None of the characters are fully formed and it all just kind of fizzles in the end.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|on this app you get no update so you get no new messages and you cant do anything than its also boring. all you do is wait and sit around waiting for nothing to happen so I suggest don't get

0307949508|4.0|Although this second book of Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy could easily stand on its own, it's best viewed as part of a continuum and read in sequence. Larsson further develops some key characters he introduced to us in The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo: We recognize Salander, Bloomquist, Berger, Bjurman, Palmgren, and H. Vanger,  once again key players in a new plot with a whole cast of new characters. Set two years after Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, this novel  focuses on  human sex trafficking in Sweden.<br /><br />  Only after tying up all the loose ends of his numerous subplots, does Larsson conclude Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. In contrast, he ends The Girl who Played with Fire with Salander severely injured and facing charges after barely surviving a life threatening encounter ( figuratively: burning in the fire's midst). Larsson's conclusion introduces us to the plot for his next book, also figuratively entitled: The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. There's enough continuity between Larsson's second and third books that they could  have been written as a single novel. (Acutally, they probably do do better divided into two books since 1542 pages with numerous subplots would have been too long for a single text. It will take Larsson 818 more pages of writing to get Salander safely out of the conflagration this book sets).<br /><br />  Larsson is a supurb master of his genre, the suspensful crime mystery novel. This book's no simplistic \\"who dunnit.\\" Larsson's leading characters are well developed enough to be flawed, while still remaining likeable, interesting, and quite unique. We can root for them. His female characters are especially intriguing: surprisingly strong, empowered women. Larsson's plots are intricately crafted and revolve around exposing key social problems. They're constructed to contain numerous subplots to keep us reading to know what will happen in this complex fictional world of Larsson's imagination. He maintains interest by throwing in  some unexpected plot twists, rather than by tricking readers and leading them down blind alleys. It's a pleasure to enter Larsson's fictional world; it's sad to leave. Larsson's fine writing style leaves his readers wanting more from this author who tragically died after completing only the third book of his ambitious ten-book project.some unexpected plot twists, rather than by tricking readers and leading them down blind alleys.

B005HSL626|3.0|graphics are good.  works great o. kindle fire.  a lot of adds...but it was free so i guess u gotta expect that.  is it th best game ever?  absolutely not.  but it's a time killer and its free...
0199235694|5.0|By focussing and pinpointing the historical, political and cultural development that Japan went through in this period, (initially in response to its sense of humiliation in the face of the so-called great powers of the western world), this book demonstrates how the nation freed itself from the unequal treaties imposed on it and how it successfully adopted the ideas and trappings of modernity and how with this success a new found national confidence soared. Whilst some sectors of society embraced the whole philosophy of modernity, that it came as a complete package, that in choosing the technical innovations that were abundant in the west, you also adopted the social manners and cultural practices, other sectors began to use this newfound confidence to challenge the notion that modernity and westernization had to mean the same thing. With this notion of Japan as a modern nation in its own right, the question shifted from what it meant to be \\"modern in a modern Japan\\" to what it meant to be Japanese. This question seem to take two paths, the first was something that could be identified as the romantic response - intellectuals, writers, artists looked to some past (imagined or otherwise) for some sense of what the \\"essence of Japaneseness\\" might be. Whether this was in some reinvention of bushido, or Shinto as a national religion and Emperor cult, or the rediscovery of a particular appreciation of a fragile shadowy beauty that characterised Japanese aesthetics. The second was how to confront this process of modernisation and asserted Japan's superiority over western nations, which was in risk of being polluted and weakened under the guise of progress. This book takes these two standpoints and follows them into the twenty first century, through the historical figures, artists and writers, showing how this has affected Japans image in the rest of the world and its self image.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love most of the games they are all super fun my favorite is serpent.They did really good job and I love it.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Pretty much the best game ever. I want to give it 5 stars, but as I play it on my kindle fire something still seems a bit &quot;off.&quot;
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun get it. fun to do and play perfect interesting games .u will love it. fun and unique.<br /> the opposite of monotonous
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This movie once again raises the bar on snowboarding movies. By about 30 notches. But what else is to be expected from this crew? They had Quicksilver/Redbull backing, Curt Morgan cinematography; Rice, Landvik, Jackson, Lago and Jones on stunts and comic relief; some of the most awesome scenery in the world; and of course, great subject matter. How could this combination fail? I think they should start wide releasing these Brain Farm movies in theaters everywhere!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am one of the many women who have had the daydreams to have been pretty enough, smart enough, loved enough by a guy like this. I don't care who you are for we all secretly wish to have been loved like Travis loves Abby. Nothing is perfect when it come to relationships and  so what if he seems obbsessive! He would never hurt her and he would risk his life to protect her. It's raw, gritty and harsh @ times but he loves her. And don't say 19 is too young to be married because I married @ that age and will have our 20th anniversary to celebrate in a few weeks. While it wasn't all \\"sparkles & blood\\" I was more enthralled with this book because it could be real. And for you who have ever been loved like that count your blessings! I hope they have a movie about this book soon and have a few ideas about who should play Travis and Abby, do you???

B005GK6QAM|5.0|What a deliciously lush disc this is, and is perhaps one of Joe Lynn Turner's finest moments.  He personally may find the blues more to his liking but music like this happens to be where JLT's voice truly shines.  He's weathered a little over the years, giving a slight edge that just flavors the music even more.  Turner sounds fantastic and flexes his vocal chops all over this disc.  Dennis Ward (Pink Cream 69) has polished the production to perfection and added some great guitars as well.  The songs are bursting with hooks and lavish melodies, with the crowning glory being the title track.  If they sound familiar, well some of them should, as many of these are actually covers mined from the 80s on songs that Joe Lynn Turner once sang BACKGROUND vocals on.  Now he's been put front and center, and sounding fantastic on tracks such as the soaring title track.  This was once belted by Cher, but Turner sounds more passionate and turns this into a very Bon Jovi sounding song.  Gina sticks close to the original by Michael Bolton, but JLT really fans the flames.  Daniel Palmqvist contributes a few new tracks, including the explosive \\"The Higher You Rise\\".  Fans of AOR or Joe Lynn Turner need this disc... the third Sunstorm cd is a pure pleasure through and through!
B005VMSATA|2.0|I rented this film primarily because Ryan Reynolds was in it.  That turned out to be its only selling point.  This movie is a special effects bonanza, but for the first time, I found them distracting.  Character development was minimal and I can actually remember very little of the story.  I am glad I didn't invest in owning this movie.

B000K7MMP4|5.0|This movie is perfect! Darcy acts extremely stiff and arrogant at first which follows the book well and Elizabeth is played very very well by Elizabeth Garvie. Mr. Collins is creepy, Mr. Bennet is cranky, and Mrs. Bennet is an old Lydia. It follows the book, and doesn't change it into a modern chick flick. Just perfect! I am dissapointed I can't buy these movies though.

B006SV2LWA|4.0|Thriller. Based on what could happen. It tries to remain scientific and accurate. It is harder to watch if you work in health care because you notice mistakes. Very good acting. I liked the lead female actress the most, she plays a lead scientist. Fishburne in a role I liked, he plays it far different from other roles, he is likeable in this one. A must see. It is even educational, dramatic, a bit scary. Inspires one to be better prepared for mass disasters or mass emgergencies. Everyone should see this, that is adults. As it is very serious.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Progress is slow. You need to connect with many other players to get some items for building. You have to buy expensive gems to make the most out of the game. They constantly push their other games at you and all of their games require gems.<br />All of their games requires an active internet connection.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|Great film. Scary. This is a prequel to the Thing from the 80's. I rec. see the original from the 1930's circa, then this one, then the one from the 80's w/ Mr. K.

B000ELJBAA|5.0|ANYTHING that David Gilmour performs, produces, etc. is simply amazing! He has been blessed by God and we are all fortunate to be able to enjoy and experience his soulful music!
6301971272|5.0|In this latest repackaging of one of the greatest westerns of all time, you get offered a \\"new\\" look at the film with the inserted deleted scenes that had previously been relegated to the \\"special features\\" section.<br />  While some of these offer a little extra background on stuff that was already in the film, most of them were unnecessary, and it isn't hard to see why they were cut in the first place. But they do no harm, and for the connoisseurs of this masterpiece, they should prove interesting if nothing else.<br />  The best part for me was the explanation of the long, lost \\"nude scene\\" from the film involving (Who else?) The Man With No Name and a \\"Working Girl\\". Without spoiling that for the reader, it's to be found in the \\"special features\\".<br />  Needless to say, a great print.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Once again, Mr. Gilmour has raised the bar!  His music comes from deep within his soul and, although this is an older recording, he has only gotten better over the years.  Buy anything you can get your hands on that his remarkable musician has recorded.  Now. . .if ONLY we could experience him LIVE!
1400069289|5.0|Habits we all have them, we all use them  but we all don't know why or how.<br /><br />Yet our habits, many would say, rule us. They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.<br /><br />This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.<br /><br />A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them.<br />Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.<br /><br />The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.<br /><br />A chapter entitled \\"The Golden Rule of Habit Change\\" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring.

B004EWEX9Y|1.0|This is not the official Apple Composite AV cable.<br /><br />What's in the REAL box?<br />- (Red/Yellow/White) 6 FT. Composite RCA Cable<br />- Power Source Adapter<br />- User Guide<br /><br />Plus, the price that this seller is selling this faux product at is the same on ([...]) $39.99. When I checked out of the Apple Online Store, my total, shipping included was $45.58. Comes in 6 days depending on your address.<br /><br />The problem that I frequently see on reviews is Thrift! Everyone wants to find a name brand product for cheap. Apple is a very intelligent company in the sense that they embed chips in their electronic product accessories so that they are and can only be used by APPLE PRODUCTS only; such as this cable! Of course you will find a similar product that you THINK will work as well as the actual thing but truth of the matter is, knock off's are NEVER better than the real thing. So, a word of advise to thrifty shoppers, IT WON'T HURT TO PAY A FEW EXTRA BUCKS FOR THE REAL THING; At least you'll be guaranteed satisfaction and the bragging rights of \\"I Have An Official Apple Product!\\"
0385344228|5.0|To say I loved this book would not do justice to the emotional rollercoaster ride it took me on. To all readers who are also parents of teenage children (like myself) - beware, as this story tackles one of the deepest and darkest fears any parent can harbour: what would you do if your child was accused of murder? How far would you go to protect your child? How many excuses would you find to believe in their innocence?<br /><br />As a father, the main character Andy is in a no-win situation from the start, which is why I easily forgave him his blind trust in his son's innocence despite his legal profession, although anyone else can see that something is seriously wrong with this child. His stalwart denial of the evidence and his stubborn refusal to acknowledge his son's problems were frustrating, but who could really blame him? My heart broke for Laurie, who unlike her husband conceded that her son may not be innocent, torn between love for her child, duty and fear. I did not for a minute want to imagine how it would feel to be in her shoes.<br /><br />I enjoyed Landay's writing style, which through writing in the first person and skipping between past and present gives good insight into the whole story and paves the way for the final gut-wrenching twist. The concept of the \\"murder gene\\", a hotly debated topic, gives plenty of food for thought and a good discussion point for any bookclub (similar to the novel \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" by Lionel Shriver), and turned Jacob into a chilling character for me - I admit that I couldn't muster up much empathy for him, and found the mere thought of being his parent unsettling. Yet Andy, in his reminiscences about cuddling the innocent baby Jacob, constantly reminds the reader that the boy is after all only a child and dearly loved by his parents.<br /><br />I could not put this book down and afterwards I just wanted to hug my own children and keep them safe. An excellent novel which will haunt me long after reading the last page.st page.
B000002KNU|5.0|Great debut of one of the most important bands of New York late 70s scene and all time rock in general. Dynamic, intelligent, schizofrenic, Talking Heads 77 is really one of the greatest debuts ever.

B001LF3YQK|3.0|Does the job I guess, but it doesn't keep the wipes very moist. I ended up getting travel packs of wipes instead. That way they don't dry out, and you can keep a pack in the car, in the stroller, in the diaper bag, etc.
0762434260|4.0|I don't understand all the problems other buyers here have had with this wand. I had no troubles with putting mine together. I did make sure to put a touch of superglue on the screws before assembly. I was rather glad the screws were a little tight; that way it wouldn't be all loose and wobbly. It's made of a sturdy resin-type plastic, but it's not the sort of thing you'd want to give to a 7-year-old to wave around. That's asking for trouble. You'd buy them one of the Rubie's plastic costume ones. I have it as a wall display with my other HP mini kits and it's great! A cool buy for only $3-4.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Although similar to other games in its concept, the execution, sound, and artwork are first rate. Very entertaining. I only wish progress in the game was reflected with visual changes to to backdrop.
B006UG90RM|1.0|Right off let me say this isn't about SAMMY and how he could've done a better job thing (though I'm not saying he wouldn't have...so would 1/2 dozen other singers including Gary Cherone and Mitch Malloy). This CD has gained so much steam based on the fans buying into a 26 year old dream and legacy. \\"IF\\" Dave could deliver as he did than this CD wouldn't be so flawed. People buy and praise this CD based on \\"what they wish it was\\" over \\"what it is\\". Dave's first 2 and his last solo CD's were far better than this one. I know Eddie did some work with Mitch Malloy but the reality is THIS IS WHAT THE VH FANS HAVE WAITED FOR and the band knew having Dave would shoot even a 1/2 ass CD into Platinum status....and it did! The reality is Dave can't sing and anyone that saw them live in 2007 knows it. Sammy, whatever you think of him CAN still sing!<br /><br />What makes this CD interesting is because those of us hardcore fans get to hear good recordings of 6-7 songs we've all had for years on bootlegs. Of course this brings up several points. 1) All these years since VHIII Eddie lost the ability to write and 2) These songs now released weren't good enough to be kicked out on an album since 1976....why are they suddenly good enough now? Kudos to the producer and studio technology to have made Dave sound THIS GOOD when anyone that's seen him live knows it ain't there. I have a nice download that will hold me till we can buy these used for under $5 and that way I don't contribute to VH who kicked out Michael Anthony without even notice (he found out on the net like the rest of us). Got a boot DVD from their last tour and Dave sounds like hell talking his way through most the songs and Wolfie looks like a deer caught in the headlights with ZERO stage presence. They even have the balls to use canned tracks of Michael Anthony's background vocals live!<br /><br />On the new VH CD itself, it sounds like alot of pieced together puzzle pieces from different puzzles between old demos re-recorded with some changes made in part or whole to the lyrics due to Roth's far more limited vocal abilities today mixed with some missed attempts to write material (or just go into a different demo vault!) to mix with that straight 1976 era material. The worst example of this is \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" which sounds like a Roth solo tune he pulled out. Makes me cringe! \\"Stay Frosty\\" is a weak attempt to try to capture the vibe of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" (a song they didn't write for those who were not aware). \\"China Town\\" is an example of them trying to write like they once did and failing and also an example of how the band can drive the song and Roth can no longer keep up and drag the song down. PROS: Ed and Alex still got it and lay down some great guitars and drums. CONS: David Lee Roth and the lack of the signature background vocals only Mike Anthony can do. The CD is a sad missed opportunity because with Sammy and a few songs gone, replaced by better this could've been a solid CD. I listen to the music of Tattoo and can almost hear the vocals Sammy would write over it. For the record, I like ALL eras of VH (Roth/Hagar/Cherone) so this review isn't coming from a DLR hater! Roth solo came out strong but couldn't sustain it. His first solo w/Vai was amazing! The second ok (though I can see why Sheehan left). After that his solo CD's were lucky to have 1 or 2 good songs with the rest being dribble. When he finally DID come out with some great songs and players on his DLR Band release he had no label support, his vocals sounded like he had a nose full of coke and the production was bad.<br /><br />All in all a pretty low class bunch!recorded with some changes made in part or whole to the lyrics due to Roth's far more limited vocal abilities today mixed with some missed attempts to write material (or just go into a different demo vault!) to mix with that straight 1976 era material.

Seemed like a lot to take on (non-reader remember) but once I started, it was so well written, that it just flowed along and took me with it. Totally enjoyed it. Kudos to Steve for wanting his life story told, and thanks to Walter Isaacson for writing such a compelling book!!
B004XNPQUO|1.0|Very creative concept, and worth the initial frustration of learning the controls. So, four stars for originality. However, you don't need a network socket open to move pixels around the screen of a Kindle Fire. So, deduct all stars for demanding permissions you don't need, much less deserve. One star, folks.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|let me just say ths book is engrossing. i am a big time reader but even if you don`t like reading you won`t be able to stop It begin in the future, north america is now called panem and i dvided into 12 districts. To show the districts that the capitol is in control and districts have no chance of rebelling the have the hunger games.The hunger games is were each district is to represent one male andone female between the ages of 12 and 18. They will be put in a areana and be forced to fight till there death.Simple one rule : stay alive. So anyway a 16 year old girl named katniss everdeen volenteers in place of her sister for the hunger games. It is basically a book of survival , and a little bit of love. I don`t want to give anyway more but let me tell you this book is worth any price

0891419063|5.0|If you are a person who is a big fan of history, war, blood and gore, you will love this book. With The Old Breed by E.B. Sledge is an autobiography about Sledge's life in the war against the Japanese in World War II. If this book were a movie, it would have 5 stars and would be rated R for blood, gore, and language. Sledge fought with the Marines in some of the biggest battles of World War II, Peleliu and Okinowa. In Peleliu he saw many gruesome wounds and deaths. Peleliu made him tired mentally and physically. In Okinowa it rained a lot and it was really muddy. In Okinowa people lost their lives and many were wounded. E.B. sledge described the action very well. He also talked in depth about the campaigns that they did. Sledge writes in first person because it is about himself, \\"Yeah,\\" I said, \\"and I'm not in any hurry, either.\\" That was a quote from the book. Review by Tyler S.
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|This was a good story and it involved some good suspense and intrigue without being too filled with horror and gore.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|11/22/63 by Stephen King is about a school teacher, Jake Epping, that's caught up in a plot to stop the assassination of JFK. But the book's synopsis may be misleading. His primary end goal may be to stop Kennedy's assassination but the book really centers on Epping's interactions while in the past and his strong desire to become part of the past by prolonging his main quest as much as possible.<br /><br />I'm very much into immersive stories with a high level of detail. This novel does not disappoint in is chock full of description regarding the 60s and features an interesting plot and many subplots. As one may expect from a Stephen King behemoth (the book is almost 1K pages!) 11/22/63's story takes some time to unfold and features an impressive amount of character building.<br /><br />There's a few things you should probably know before picking up 11/22/63. This book is about the interactions a man from 2011 would have if he was suddenly placed in the 1960s. The novel is huge and spends a fair amount of time detailing the irrelevant and day-to-day exploits of Epping. Such details are fine and give the book substance but are largely irrelevant as far as the \\"stop Oswald\\" plot is concerned (such elements are used to show \\"time\\" pushing back against Epping as he attempts to alter the past but for all intents and purposes the majority of the book deals with Epping's rather unremarkable life).<br /><br />As other customer reviews have indicated, you may not find these mundane exploits and pieces of character development worthy of taking up so much time and description. Immersive writing is Stephen King's forte. Some details may suite readers differently depending on the type of books they typically read. There were times I felt some of the details in the book to be nothing more than meaningless space fillers (this is especially so toward the middle of the book). 97% of the book deals with more trivial matters than the book's synopsis would suggest: Epping teaching, directing school plays, and so on (Stephen King, as is the case with most of his novels, shines through as if he - the author - uses Epping as a fictitious version of himself to explore his own yearnings and desires in a fictional way). If you're like me you'll probably skip or speed read through a few pages toward the middle of the book to get to more interesting portions. These moments do serve to make the main character more well rounded but it could have been done with the reader's attention span in mind.<br /><br />The more thoughtful and interesting parts of 11/22/63 are in the beginning and end of the book. So if the slow mid-section doesn't turn you off entirely you may get a lot of enjoyment out of it!<br /><br />11/22/63 is truly worth reading. Stephen King's writing is, as always, superb. Sentence structure is short and to the point. Quick reading and lots of detail regarding the time periods covered (sometimes inaccurate or exaggerated I'm told by historian buff friends but I hardly noticed). Such leaves the patient reader extremely satisfied.<br /><br />While, in my opinion, it doesn't compare to some other Stephen King works (most notably \\"Under the Dome\\" and the Dark Tower Series), it's an enjoyable read filled with a lots of great details regarding the time period. The story has a definite \\"Quantum Leap\\" feel (a television show from the 90s). While fans of the sci-fi genre should be warned that many such elements are presented in a \\"lite\\" fashion throughout the novel, 11/22/63 shines on its own as a fine work of fiction complete with an immersive world and plenty of development.ecting school plays, and so on (Stephen King, as is the case with most of his novels, shines through as if he - the author - uses Epping as a fictitious version of himself to explore his own yearnings and desires in a fictional way).

B0042J6VUS|3.0|I bought this hoping that my iPhone4 (with the case) would fit, but it did not. It will fit without the case. To get it to fit, pull the side arm out all the way. Holding the iPhone sideways, insert the top part into the top arm and use the iPHone to push the arm up while angling the bottom in.<br /><br />However, an iPod Touch 4th Gen in and Otterbox Commuter case will _just_ fit in it. It didn't work for what I wanted it to, but my son is happy to have it for his iPod.<br /><br />FYI, the part that holds the device is not removable, so you cannot put it on a real tripod. I am sure a person could lash it onto a real tripod somehow.

B000HKYBXA|5.0|Anything Kenneth Branagh commits to film is excellent, and his appreciation for the beauty of language and the stage  makes his productions of Shakespeare no exception.<br />Branagh's rendering of the grief stricken Hamlet is stellar, and his direction of this well-known tragedy is, without a doubt, the most true to the play's script that I have ever seen.  I suspect were the Bard to view this incomparable interpretation, he would be quick to shout \\"Bravo\\" and to grant Branagh his approval.

0307279189|4.0|Christopher McDougall is a hopelessly romantic runner. He has fallen for the universal sport that has challenged mankind from the very beginning. In sickness and health, for richer and porrer, till death does he part: McDougall loves the run. His passion shows in his book titled, Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen. We are taken on a journey around the world and through time to study the way in which we are made to run. McDougall tells an amazing story centered around a group of tribal runners called the Tarahumara. These people of the Copper Canyons embody the pure spirit of running and exemplify how each and every one of us is specifically designed to run.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book. Christopher McDougall has done well at blending history, science, anthropology and research into a compelling narrative. You care for the people and see them develop from beginning to end. He may be a bit blinded in his romantic engagement with the Tarahumara. Regardless of McDougall's obvious bias we see an honest and well thought out idea embedded into an adventure story.

B0045HCJSK|5.0|There are so many story lines going on, I can watch this every week and still find something I missed. It was panned at the time, because it wasn't like a normal western: Nobody even leaves town! Can you imagine being 22 year old Angie Dickenson, and having to keep up with legends like Wayne & Martin? I've been in love with her ever since.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Mid-October 2012:  Lowering back to one star because of the return of loud, obnoxious ads that start immediately with no way to skip until several seconds have already bombarded your senses!!!<br /><br />Around the second week of August 2012, I re-installed this game and was so pleased to see that the storage issue and the way the ads display has been improved.  I am now back to my original \\"I think Solitaire by Mobilityware is wonderful!\\" opinion.<br /><br />Third review:<br />On July 7, 2012 I've finally had enough and decided to uninstall this app.  As I've stated earlier, I like the way the game plays but the amount of internal storage it uses even with the app itself installed on my SD card makes my phone constantly run low on space.  I'll keep their Freecell and Spider on my phone but this one is now gone.  Too bad.<br /><br />Second review:<br />Lowering from 5 to 2 stars.  The video ads have become very annoying!  And the amount of storage they use up is obnoxious.  Even with this installed on my phone's 32gig SD card, the amount of internal storage it fills up forces me to delete the used-up space every time I play - which means losing my preferred settings and statistics.  The game itself is great but I'm now  considering uninstalling it.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />This Solitaire game is wonderful because the possibility of winning *drawing three cards* is more like the reality of how often one can actually win using a physical deck of cards.<br /><br />I know some people have complained about how hard it is to win but that is as it should be because that is how it actually is in \\"real\\" - i.e. non-digital - Solitaire!

B00005B4GU|5.0|definitely a more electronic radiohead and even though it came out so close to kid a they are completely different albums very great buy though it you like radiohead came on time and exceeded my expectations
B0000062RZ|5.0|While the CD has always been on my list of top Page/Plant creations, it's dark and lifeless sound has always been a barrier to enjoy it to the real height it deserves. While I invested more and more in my Hi-Fi setup, I heard more and more, but the Clarksdale's audition always remained some kind of an extraction from the puzzle of the overloaded and overproduced sound.<br />The vinyl is in the different league. You hear this music how it was thought to be - and it should in no way sound simple and bright, like early Plant. This is great music, in line with the Zep's albums. Unlike many others, P&P did not try to do a 20-years-after-LZ. This is different music, but that is, like any LZ, a music innovation and that's why it has the inner essence of LZ in it.<br />To be honest, it is still a challenge for the equipment, you need your system to be set on the top to get the best from it. But if you have high resolution, high energy system - there are not so many albums to demonstrate it's capability.<br />A piece of art. Music, performance and engeneeering.
B006X08FDA|5.0|--------------------------------------------------<br />Carolina Chocolate Drops<br />\\"Leaving Eden\\"<br />(Nonesuch, 2012)<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />A richly diverse, challenging record from a vigorous, intelligent band... another wily mix of old-timey music and backwoods blues from a contemporary band that mines the more obscure corners of the African-American musical heritage. The Chocolate Drops hearken back to the 19th century minstrel show days and the bluesy jug bands of yesteryear.  Their fourth album pushes the group into more self-consciously modern territory, with songs such as \\"Country Girl\\" and \\"Leaving Eden\\" that stray from their more traditional roots, and bring them closer to the style of Americana groups such as the Be-Good Tanyas, Uncle Earl, et.al..  You gotta love their unruly sound, though, with the squeaky fiddle and super-plunky, thrashed-out banjo, particularly when paired up with now-arcane, old-school instruments such as the hambones, as heard on their version of \\"Ruby, Are You Mad At Your Man.\\" Highlights include \\"Boodle-De-Bum-Bum,\\" a great jugband tune that's one of many styles in an eclectic mix that adventurous Americana fans will want to check out. Fun stuff! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)

B0052U59F4|5.0|First, I don't see what all the fuss is about this book!  It contains S&M stuff, but not enough to feel as though Ana is being abused.  Some people can be so overly judgmental when it comes to what is right/wrong sexually.  I believe it is a personal thing and therefore not up for judgement. However the way the erotic-power-struggle dance between Christian and Ana is intoxicating and I found myself able to delight in vicarious sexual arena that I would not have pursued in my real life. This book is exciting and tantalizing.  Worth the buzz for the book sales it will receive from it, but not really due to content in my opinion.  It's just a great read.
0785139168|4.0|Short of reading the actual book [[ASIN:0486284735 Pride and Prejudice (Dover Thrift Editions)]], the BBC TV mini-series [[ASIN:B00364K6YW Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)]] is the best way to experience Pride & Prejudice. But if you don't have that kind of time, the Marvel comic is the next best thing. The writer is obviously devoted to the source material, and she condenses it without mangling it. The art is lovely, but fails to evoke the period. The Bennett sisters sport modern hairstyles and wear Hollywood make-up. Even the cover art mimics a modern women's magazine. I am heartily in favor of turning classics into comics, since it is the only way to get most people (especially kids) to read them. However, P&P is short on action and long on conversation, so it is not the best fit for the comics medium. Long-time comic book fans will find this work lacking as will long-time Jane Austen lovers. It's probably best suited for neophytes of both fandoms.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I truly enjoyed this musical.<br />I saw the 2011 movie adaptation of the Sydney Australian company of \\"Love Never Dies.\\" The improvements they made from the original London production was simply was perfect. It truly needed it. I certainly recommend watching the movie because you really need to see it before falling in love with the music. I saw it last February in the movies and was like \\"ehh, its good.\\" I was the same with Phantom of the Opera. I needed to step back from it after seeing it, listen to the music, and then just fall in love with it and demand to see it again! And just like the original Phantom, I am falling in love with \\"Love Never Dies!\\" Even though this isn't the Australian company singing this, I simply love SIerra and Ramin! They were perfect in Phantom and they are simply excellent in the show as well, even though the staging isn't the same as the Australian. I completely recommend buying the movie then purchasing the cd! Give it a chance and be open minded!!!

I am highly impressed with this book and will enjoy season 3 when it premieres.

James Arness was the perfect actor to play this role, he was tall, had the look, give him a bald wig, some make up, some spiked gloves, the right clothes and ja-blam...THE THING!<br />Another reviewer here said this new remake was TOO faithful to the original so I said to myself \\"With 21st Century Technology, this should be freakin' AWESOME!\\".<br />Well to my surprise, in many ways, it started out as being pretty darn close to the original, then it got to the point where they brought the creature in the block of ice into the installation and what happened afterwards when I realized that the person who reviewed this must've turned the movie off in disappointment because this movie then turned away from the original Thing and takes on the remake of Carpenter's.....Just bumped up a bit I imagine since I never really saw Carpenter's in it's entirety because I am guilty of turning off the movie in disgust early on but I now have Carpenter's version on my DVR and will be revisiting it soon enough.<br />This Newer version is pretty darned Gory and makes for some interesting viewing. It does, however, what the Original \\"THING\\" never did and that's replicate anything human it touches, but I know that's what Carpenter's version did but in the Original version, it did need blood to multiply via seed pods, which is basically the only variation on how the Thing \\"procreates\\" in the remakes.<br />I usually rent movies now before I buy, It's now on my \\"BUY\\" list, I'd recommend you do the same before purchasing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game, great for passing the time.  You can choose the background and the pictures on the deck of cards from your own photos.  I also like being able to choose the draw one or three cards option.  It moves quickly.  Great game, and I have experienced no glitches.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|love it!<br />can't stop playing<br />I'm only into the first part of Greece, but I'm so addicted!<br />this game is great
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun and all the games are actually challenging so u don't win them right away. amazing!!!!!!
B007C7UZIG|1.0|As of now the application asks for the \\"Phone state and identity\\" permission which would allow it to get the phone number and IMEI and I'm not willing to share this information with Valve, they already get enough information as it is when you're getting billed. Sorry, fix the application to not require such permissions and I'll consider it, thanks.

B004JHY8A8|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  The second part could have been more detailed, but the first part is really good and interesting.  Good to learn new things that happened and I didn't know about.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good way to pass the time when your bored. games aren't overly challenging but enough to entertain. overall a fun app. I am enjoying it and would recommend it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|works well on Nexus, landscape or portrait. keeps score and gives hints. cards have appealing design. annoying ads appear after every deal but i suppose somebody has to pay for this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. It is very user-friendly and the Bible reading plans are a helpful feature. The search capabilities are very good as well.
B006ON41FC|5.0|So, I've been playing this for like a week now.  So addictive and fun.  I took a stopwatch to my squirrel to figure out how fast he is flying after I realized how far I had flown total.  Anyway, he timed at 25m/s at regular starting speed.  That's .025km/s.  X 60 = 1.5 km/minute X 60 = 90km/hour = 56mph.  55 may save lives but 56 apparently does not, at least not in this game.  Awesome fun game with a SUPER FAST flying squirrel.
006197806X|5.0|I loved Delirium, so I preordered the sequel. I received it earlier this week and finished reading it this evening. I LOVED it!!! It had me nearly crying at parts and laughing at others. At the end, I was left sitting with my mouth open in disbelief not able to wait for the third book to come out. This is a great series and I have thoroughly enjoyed it so far!

1451627289|5.0|I received this book for Christmas because it was on my wishlist. When I opened it and I saw how long it was, I thought oh no, another bloated book by an author who editors don't want to say no to anymore...(While I enjoy long novels by Stephen King like the Stand, some of his newer long books have not been as interesting or worth finishing).<br /><br />However I was pulled in from the first sentence on the first page and my interest never waned. Pages of loving descriptions, of internal thoughts were never boring. Just the opposite. It felt like dessert. It felt like a work of Love. It felt like while I read the book I was in the prescense of a master storyteller and I was in awe.<br /><br />And love it I did. From the very first moment the main character stepped into the past, I fell in love with the 1960s and felt like I was there. And I loved it.<br /><br />If a lesser known novelist wrote this book, those long details, and excessive narrative would have been cut. People would say no one wants to read that stuff, keep with the action. If that happened, this novel wouldn't have been the same. I wouldn't have been able to fall in love. For that, maybe it's a shame young novelists are forced to write books that read like movies.<br /><br />Books should be savored. We should take our time. This book reminded me of that.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Too often sequels or second seasons of hit TV dramas are disappointments.  Lightning seems to strike only once much of the time.  Fortunately we have here a rare exception.  Downton Abbey 2 is as riveting as the first season and in many ways an improvement, with the backdrop of World War I lending additional drama and heartbreak to the story.<br /><br />Its 1917, and the noble Earl and Countess of Grantham still reside in their magnificent Downton Abbey. Three years of war have taken their toll. Matthew Crawley, heir to the title and on and off love interest of the eldest daughter Lady Mary Crawley, is fighting in France.  The two young footmen Thomas and William are also serving their country.  Downton Abbey becomes a convalescent home for wounded officers and the three Crawley daughters work as nurses.  Below stairs the servants run the house as efficiently as ever with generous dollops of drama, primarily from the long love between the valet Bates and the maid Anna.  Additionally, the chauffeur has fallen in love with the youngest Crawley daughter, Lady Sybil. Adding some extra fun are the Dowager Countess and Matthew's mother Isobel Crawley, who are locked in a never ending oneupmanship contest.<br /><br />The excellent cast headed by Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, Penelope Wilton as Isobel, Hugh Bonneville as the Earl, and Elizabeth McGovern as the Countess do full justice to the rich story line provided by Julian Fellowes.  By the end of the series viewers will feel emotionally wrung out but will eagerly await the third season.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was amazing. I have read all of the other Percy Jackson's book and this one fit in right with the others. It is defiantly one of my favorite of the whole franchise. This book is totally worth buying and keeping in your collection.
1451648537|5.0|I rate this book 5 stars for what Steve's life reveals, but only 3 stars for the author's effort.  The book is very readable and Steve is hugely interesting.  Buy and read the book.  You won't regret it.  I'd feel a lot better about the author's effort if he didn't keep letting us know that, well, after all, Steve was really a jerk.  Once you realize the author is going to interject a story to illustrate that 'Steve was a jerk' every so often, you can get past that and begin to understand the Steve's amazingly creative life.  The book's an incredible read in that sense--how did one person--a neighbor, almost--bring together so many creative people during one lifetime and create such great companies--Apple and Pixar.  Through Apple, Steve's affected so many of us in such a profound way.  It's hard to imagine life without a Nano and the audible books, lectures and music that go with it.  Then there are all those other amazingly designed tools that extend our lives in so many ways.  Maybe his story will spark that creativity that you have within yourself.  Go for it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is not only a great way to pass the time-but I absolutely love completing the many quests to later purchase cute outfits for my flying squirrel with the nuts I have collected.  definitely a keeper for me. rainbow squishy mushroom.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was the first book I bought for the Kindle Fire. Reading it was a pleasure. The clarity of the photos was great, the footnotes were clickable, and the extensive index at the back was clickable. The Kindle makes it possible to click on a footnote link which takes you to the footnote itself, and then return to your reading. The amount of detail in this book is fantastic, and the author doesn't shy away from revealing Steve's foibles as well as his successes. I recommend this book to anyone interested in computers, whether PC or Mac.
1451627289|5.0|My first thought was, oh no, not another 800+ page book! Then, oh no, not politics. Well this is one of my issues - judging a book by its cover. Well, I opened it up and was hooked from the get go. I should have realized that Mr. King wasn't out to disappoint me. The book was long, yes . . . but it had a story that pulled me through. I couldn't wait to pick it up every day. And I was sad to see it go. Without giving anything away, the book develops into a love story with the thread of what you read about on the jacket drawing the main character ever toward his goal. I felt for him. I nearly cried. I believe the book rounds out to a believable and enjoyable ending.
1466401885|1.0|After reading a few positive reviews I decided to get this book.  What a mistake!  Is this a YA novel?  Because I am 50 years old and this book was boring! Yeah, I said boring.  I know that there are a slew of positive reviews out there but, really this was written for a younger crowd because it was lacking substance.  Not too young of a crowd though because of the sex and violence.  As long as I am on that topic - the violence that Travis is involved in is just so wrong!! Is it really ok to beat somebody up until they are almost dead?  And to have Abbey - who is an intelligent young female look up to that and long to be with a guy like that is such a horrible message to send to young females!!!  I just HATE that part of the book.  Don't we have enough abuse in this country to then have it being admired in a novel?  I also agree with one of the other reviews in that the names were very annoying in this novel - especially the ridiculous nicknames.  Then the ending - I was shocked - to have Abbey jumping into marriage with Travis - she deserved SO much better.  It wasn't a beautiful disaster - it was just a disaster!
B001TW69J4|3.0|I was really excited to hear this album after reading about Tosin Abasi and his ridiculous skills on the guitar. Being a big Meshuggah fan, I was also intrigued by the whole \\"djent\\" thing, which I guess I don't really get, and not sure applies to Animals as Leaders. After listening to this album 5 or 6 times, I admit to being blown away by Abasi's skill - he does stuff on the guitar that sounds impossible - the guy can shred. However, I don't think he is much of a song writer - not a lot of memorable grooves, and many of the riffs and licks do not necessarily flow all that well together. He and Misha Mansoor apparently did all the guitar and drum programming - no real band here- and it sounds a bit robotic. I also expected a heavier sound - much of this is sort of atmospheric and jazzy, reminding me more of Ozric Tentacles than Meshuggah. Who knows, maybe another 10 listens will change my mind, but I doubt it. Looking forward to his next release; I'm hoping the song writing will catch up with the musicianship.

I savored every sentence over the 3 months I was enthralled with reading it, on my Kindle.  I wanted another full novel about each of the characters.  What came next for Hal, Mario, Madame Psychosis, and Don?  Their stories ended, swallowed in the Great Concavity. DFW, you will live on forever in this masterpiece.  Thank you.

It would be a far greater album if it was only a single disc and half the annoying tracks were off of it. BUY 'before the dawn heals us' first. Then buy this, since I do like half the tracks, but disappointed by the other half too.

B007BLDFWG|2.0|This movie had potential but it's main storyline is left undeveloped.  This is the only movie I've ever seen that didn't have an ending.  It went to black and I thought the video went out on me but then the ending credits started and I thought, \\"what the f...?\\"<br /><br />They never fully explained the \\"Marlene\\" part of her name.  It started to, but as with most of this movie, some things were just ideas that seemed to fall flat.<br /><br />The actors were great in their rolls, but it was a poor script that never managed to wrap itself back around to make any sense.<br /><br />I heard so many good reviews when this movie came out that I really expected something far better.  However, when a movie doesn't resolve itself and has a screwy ending that leaves the viewer wondering what just happened, it's not good.<br /><br />If I was in a movie theatre, I'd demand my money back.
1400067936|4.0|Several researchers have already explained this: we are terrible at computing odds. One of the main evolutionary theories is that, for our ancestors, it was better to overestimate the chances of being hurt or killed. The corollary is that we don't understand intuitively probability, and this has many consequences in our modern life and work.<br /><br />This book is also about the Monte Carlo method. Using computing power, you can simulate many \\"parallel histories\\". This has the advantage of seeing the odds directly with systems that are too complex to be modeled and analyzed mathematically. Some scientists call this method \\"brute force\\", which it is, but it works in some cases. Taleb presents this method with several systems in an easy and pedagogical manner.<br /><br />The third main thread of the book is that it's more valuable to be a wealthy dentist that a multi-millionaire trader that has a high chance of \\"blowing up\\". Or the reverse, the trader is the lucky one from a big pool of less successful colleagues. If you're familiar with Borges's \\"Babel Library\\", you will get the point. Taleb explains it from many different angles. One example: you put monkeys in front of typewriters. One of them writes Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. It is less impressive if the original pool of monkeys is in the order of the mega-trillions than if they are just twenty. The same apply for traders, but we just see the lucky one (the monkeys that succeed in writing theater) and never see the others.<br /><br />And this leaves me with the more frustrating part of the book. Although the author claims and suggests throughout that, as a trader, he has always been on the \\"safe side\\", i.e., minimizing his chances of blowing up, he never explains how he does it. The dentist example is clear, but it doesn't automatically translate to finance.<br /><br />The book is really entertaining to read, if you don't mind the bullying and self-satisfied style of the author. Some reviewers complain (a lot) about this. I, in turn, found it most amusing. And I think it really makes for a lighter read that would have been otherwise.about this.

0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain's research on introversion is incredibly expansive.  She worked on this book for more than five years and gathered to fruits of scores of scientific studies on personality.  Many of them demonstrate that introversion is a matter of the way brains process stimuli, that introverts become overwhelmed and tired because they are more sensitive to stimuli, especially in social situations.  Introverts therefore find a nice balance of stimulation in focused settings such as reading, working alone, or connecting to one or few others at a time.  The science is worthy of psychologists but written in a way that a layperson like myself could get a basic idea of the material.<br /><br />The gift of the book, however, is its nuanced understanding of culture and the dynamics of introversion.  Cain doesn't believe that introversion is superior or inferior to extroversion.  She argues that both personality types are necessary for a balanced and rich world.  Her concern is that American culture is so oriented toward extroversion that the gifts of introverts are often suppressed, and many introverts live their lives exhausted because they have to pretend to be extroverted.<br /><br />Cain demonstrates how introverts and extroverts may embrace each others' gifts in relational dynamics, the workplace, and many other settings.  She argues that the financial meltdown of 2008 was partly due to a culture of extroversion that always rewarded risk and silenced the voices of those who tended to be more cautious or quiet.  She demonstrates how academia and business have a lot to learn from cultures that value introversion, such as Japan and Korea.<br /><br />I am naturally introverted but have an extroverted profession (clergy at a large church).  I'm also married to a very strong extrovert.  Cain's book helped me to overcome being frustrated by so much that feels to me to be a limitation.  I don't work a room well, but I do connect closely with a few people at a time.  I don't do well with an open door and I'm exhausted by constant meetings.  There's nothing wrong with closing my door to get some things done.  I like taking a day off to read, write, and have no noise around.  I'm not crazy or misanthropic.  I have to live in an extroverted world. But that world needs much that I have to offer.  And I can only offer it by being who I am.  So, I found this book to be affirming, practical, and a great grace.l with an open door and I'm exhausted by constant meetings.  There's nothing wrong with closing my door to get some things done.

1400032717|5.0|First off, I don't care if the character portrayed in this book is an inaccurate depiction of Aspergers Syndrome or Autism or whatever because the story amused and entertained me which is hard to do. I don't read very much because a lot of books bore me, but I found this book very interesting and easy to read. I read it in a week, which is phenomenal for me. The main character of the novel reminds me of Dr. Sheldon Cooper from the TV series The Big Bang Theory. If you enjoy the show The Big Bang Theory then you are likely to enjoy this book as well. I think it has some geek appeal. Don't pay attention to all of the Negative Nelly's who bashed this book.
0143119680|1.0|This is one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read. The other 1-star reviews are right. There is way too much wine/tea drinking, and descriptions of Diana changing her clothing. Why do I need to know the color of her pants, what they are made of, and why she has chosen to put them on?<br /><br />I was soooo anticipating the moment when her riding boots finally loosen up and she can put them on all by herself!! NOT!<br /><br />I'm not impressed with all the stupid powers she keeps acquiring, either. And does the author really have to detail every meal she eats and every time she takes a nap?<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention that her boyfriend owns a giant castle in France? Yeah, and he smells like cinnamon. Speaking of smells, he also has a creepy way of knowing every time Diana is turned on just by smelling her. It's weird.<br /><br />I was under the mistaken impression that this book would be kind of a fantasy novel. It turned out to be a cheesy romance novel with all the romance taken out. I don't read those type of books anyway, but I can only guess that all the 5-star reviews were written by people that do. I can't imagine how boring my own life would have to be in order for me to enjoy reading about someone taking naps and doing yoga.<br /><br />This is the worst book I have read in quite some time. And this is coming from a fan of Twilight. Yep, that's right.

1932100660|5.0|I was scheduled for weight loss surgery when I was turned on to this book THE CHINA STUDY. As I read it I realized that I could do this after the surgery. Surgery was scheduled for Monday morning early and Friday evening I made a phone call to my nephew and after 1 hour on the phone I realized I didn't need to go through with the surgery. I walked out of the bedroom and my wife made me call and cancel the surgery. I did and it was the best thing for me. I didn't need the surgery because with this book and this knowledge I could do it without the surgery. I never felt comfortable about the surgery but I wanted to get my life back and get off of my diabetic meds so bad that I was willing to do it. I had jumped through all the hoops and had lost 20 lbs. qualifing for the surgery and continued loosing weight without starving to death and one month later the doctor took me off one of my diabetic meds. I was thrilled. I continue to loose weight, feel better and better and I am glad that I still had some of my old cloths that I had grown out of. The weight loss surgery people tell you this is your last chance and the only way to lose weight permenantly. You don't know how many people I know that have gained it back. There must be some discipline somewhere. Read this book and change your life style, improve the quality of your life and rid yourselves of diease. This book should be the Standard Works or the Bible for those that want to be healthy. For years I've heard that people can change and heal themselves through changing their diets. Will here it is in black and white, the answers, the HOW TO to take control of your life and health. This book will open up a whole new world to you. I have many personel experiances of loved ones who have reversed their health issues. Don't be afraid to contact me. I am an old fat man who is crippled and I am still loosing weight and getting healthier.

B007G5FX4K|5.0|Thank you, Madonna, for finally releasing the REAL first single from MDNA. Something tells me \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" was created as a Super Bowl tie-in, given the video, the performance, etc. But lucky for gay men and dance music enthusiasts the world over, the Queen has put her dukes up once again and thrown out \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" as a pre-release \\"second single,\\" three weeks before the record is due in stores. Musically, it's not genius--but turn the speakers up and you won't care. You'll be too busy trying not to trip over the coffee table while you dance wildly. Trust me. I've been there three times today.<br /><br />  My only complaint is that, days within this single's official release, Madonna and Co. made an official name change for this track after being threatened by legal action from Joe Francis and his Girls Gone Wild empire. While M's manager and long-time friend, Guy Oseary, has gone on record stating the name change did not stem from Francis' 'cease and desist' letter, I call B.S. Madonna's very own MADONNAVEVO on YouTube originally posted the track with the plural \\"Girls\\" title. When stories began to circulate concerning the drama and legal correspondence, the name change drops. WTF, Madonna? You're Madonna. You should have kept it your way. Or was that someone else telling her Dad she wasn't changing her show for him because it comprimised her artistic integrity? Oh, how I long for the early 90's sometimes...

B005URRCUY|5.0|I am a \\"old blues, soul (neo and not),conscious rap, jazz, born in the funk, hip hop head\\", but ever since I listen to, Tighten Up I am new fan of the Black Keys. Loved the albums Brothers, Attack and Release, and now El Camino. After reading the narrow minded reviews of the \\"since the begging\\" fans and the dislike of anything Danger Mouse (get over it Gnarls Barkley is bad-ass) I listen to their suggestion as best Black Key's album Thickfreackness (name alone sold me) and that Cd is boss also. The Black Keys are just a talented band and it works, their sounds is just AMAZING sn: fav track Nova Baby and Dead and Gone.

0439023483|1.0|I'm seventeen, and everybody and their mother told me to read The Hunger Games, because \\"it's incredible!\\". I finally decided \\"Why not?\\", despite the fact that I have long given up on Young Adult novels. Sure, I've come across some good ones, but The Hunger Games is a prime example of why I don't shop in that section anymore.<br />For what was advertised to me as an \\"awesome, fast-paced adventure\\", I was bored out of my mind from start to finish. With every turn of the page, I thought it'd get better, thinking surely something interesting had to happen or else people wouldn't be so obsessed with it. Twilight should have taught me that people can go nuts over poorly executed literature, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt.<br />The book is poorly written, in the POV of the main character, Katniss. When I say \\"poorly written\\", I mean both in the construct and execution of plot and characters, AND the writing style (e.g., Lots of cliche ideas, like \\"it feels like I was just dreaming\\", and one line I remember reading was \\"the saltiness of the soup reminds me of my tears\\". I find that ridiculous, like some moping Emo-stereotype) And, because the story is in first-person, I (*spoilers*?) started the book KNOWING that she wasn't going to die (not to mention, two books follow). I didn't feel any danger for her and I didn't like her. While, admittedly, I like the CONCEPT of the book, I didn't enjoy anything about it while reading. The characters and plot are one-dimensional. It was painfully predictable. Cliche. Boring. Immature.<br /><br />The sad thing is, I think teenagers like this book because it requires no thought--it has no sustenance by means of developed characters or intricate plot. If we want people my age to start reading, should we really settle for feeding them empty stories like this one?
B006GHC298|5.0|This SACD sounds great. Probably because the original recording and mix were great to begin with. The soundfield is wide and deep, the musical instruments are present and almost tangible, guitars especially. Due to increased resolution, there are a lot of intricacies, so far unperceptable. Low end is there, but not overwhelming and highs are sparkling - obviously enhanced, but far from shrill. All of this, however, doesn't deter from the crystal voice that is in the center of the proceedings. Everything is as smooth as it should be. The only problem I have, is with the packaging. It represents interesting try to go a step further from usual mini LP cardboard packages, it is unexpected, but on the other side, it is not perfectly engineered, doesn't want to stay closed (unless it is sealed back in the plastic bag), and, being made from rather thin cardboard (as to allow for multiple foldings), is prone to damage during transport, especially in the area of the spine (as you can see in the picture). These are minor factors, but for the unusually high price, potential buyers should be aware of every aspect. To repeat the most important, this disc sounds perfect, and is pure sonic heaven!

It still is great advice for making friends, which is why I passed it on to my daughters; however not so great when writing a review. Now there is a difference between being down right mean and constructive criticism. To be honest I'm a little unsure how this is going to come across.<br /><br />James Dashner Maze Runner Series made it my way through B4R's first three Monthly Series read. I will admit it! After I started reading half way through the first book I just had to go searching, trying to find a reason t keep reading. I was shocked to find that I couldn't find a reason to keep it going. I was almost turned off completely when I came across the author tooting his own horn about how great his own book is. Gish! That sounded bad; don't get me wrong every author should be proud of their work. Enough, let's move on with the review.<br /><br />I truly have no idea what to say. Had the book not been a group read I wouldn't have finished it much less continued the series. I will admit that JD writing of the surroundings was vivid however he fell off a cliff with character development. Maze Runner read like a 379 page idea for a great story pitch.<br /><br />That said I gave the book 2 stars because it was interesting! However I am hoping book 2 gets better because the ending of Maze Runner seemed promising.<br /><br />Disclosure: I participated in Books for Review Club and a copy was provided to me by the author.

It is hard to talk about the plot without revealing story. But I will say this about the plot if you thought things were rough on Thomas and the other gladers in Maze Runner, then hang on to your seats because things are twisted in this one.<br /><br />The effort that JD took at allowing the characters some personality didn't go unnoticed. I found book two a bit more interesting and I think everyone will. The author struggled to life to the series. I found myself easing off Thomas a bit. Newt has some likeability as well. Don't get me wrong, it's still very informative, a bit harsh at times it has a few one line funnies thrown here and there. Although the characters might not have been three-dimensional, I found myself drawn into the storyline. Wise cracking guys, threat of death two girls one guy, wicked and a mystery all rolled into one kept me interested to the very end.<br /><br />I don't think I would out right recommend this series for adults but I think Jr. High boys and girls alike would find the series interesting.<br /><br />P-S I have to admit this... the first 25% of the book I used the text-to-speech function on my kindle because I didn't think I would enjoy it and I didn't want to be accused of not doing anything with it. In the end.... The book won out and grabbed my full attention so I finished it under my own reading power!!!<br /><br />Disclosure: I participate in tours  and a copy was provided to me by the author.

I must say the tats scared the klunk out me. I had this feeling that they played an important role plot. Being a post apocalyptic series I thought they would have more meaning.<br /><br />I only bring this up because I am at stand still. As I read the series just grew on me. I had to keep reading to find out what happened with this story line or that storyline. I was impressed that that JD made me sniffle not but twice (first chuck, then Newt). Not an easy task when I find the mystery a better character than the character themselves.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the storyline I still find myself confused as to what happened to the gladers that got their memories back? And exactly where was it that Thomas and the immunes that made it out went to? The wrap up felt a little to rushed and story line felt undone; but overall I enjoyed the book and series.<br /><br />Disclosure: I participated in Books for Review Club and a copy was provided to me by the author.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved this movie.  I went to see it in the theaters the first day it started.  The theater was filled with women chatting about the book before the movie.  The book was so excellent that I wanted to immediately see who was cast for the characters.  The acting was superb.  It is too bad the movie wasn't longer and couldn't have had more content from the book.  The scene with the toilets on the front lawn didn't disappoint.  It made everyone laugh.
0553582038|5.0|I've read about a hundred hostile reviews of this book, and I just don't agree.<br /><br />I've just finished reading the first four books, and I'll read Dance with Dragons when it comes out in paperback in a few weeks.  I enjoyed Feast just as much as the first three.<br /><br />Spoilers follow.<br /><br />It was great to see more of Cersei.  The schemes and sharp tongues of the three queens - Cercei, Margaery and Olenna - were a highlight of the book for me.  I hope we see more of Olenna.  For those who mainly want bloody battles, political intrigues may not be as exciting, but I enjoyed them.<br /><br />The focus on Cersei also redressed an imbalance in the earlier books.  Too often we had seen the `good' characters, such as Eddard Stark, brought down by their errors of judgement, while the `bad' ones always triumphed.  Now we see Cersei making a few errors of her own.<br /><br />I thought the focus on a smaller group of characters in this book was fine.  There are a lot of different points of view now, and too many makes it hard to follow.  There are enough different threads going on in Westeros at this point of the story to constitute an interesting book without needing to keep darting off to Essos or the Wall.<br /><br />Many reviews criticized the Brienne storyline: too much wandering around without achieving her designated objective.  It's hard to see why this should be a surprise, since it's exactly what Arya did for the whole of Storm of Swords.  It shows us what's happening all over Westeros, which is the intent, and it works.<br /><br />Others have criticized the introduction of more Ironborn and Dornish characters.  Again, this shouldn't have been unexpected.  It's how the whole series has operated.  Just when we thought the Starks and Lannisters were the main focus, Clash of Kings required us to take Stannis and his retinue on board.  Then Storm of Swords threw in the Tyrells.  So there should be no shock that another book expanded the cast even further.  Anyway, how anyone who loves Martin's world could see the Iron Islands or Dorne on the map a not wonder what is going on there is beyond me.<br /><br />Finally, many reviewers seem to want `closure'.  I don't think that will happen.  This is not a quest with a natural end - the ring gets thrown into the mountain of fire and ushers in a new age of peace and plenty - rather, it's a history.  And history never really finishes.  But for those of you who want it, here's the ending you're after.<br />---------<br />\\"Tyrion sped off to Meereen where he met up with Dany and told her all about the political disruption in Westeros.  Dany immediately realized the time to strike was now, so she jumped on Drogon's back and led the three dragons off across the Narrow Sea.  First they sped up north and incinerated all the Others, then flew down to King's Landing.  Finding Cersei Lannister in bed with Osmund Kettleblack, Dany determined that she had to die, so had Drogon incinerate her too, to the joy of the whole population of Westeros, who immediately begged her to ascend the throne.  And she did, and (despite never previously having demonstrated any knowledge of Westeros, any skill at ruling or, indeed, any common sense) Dany proved to be a wise and just ruler, and everyone in the Seven Kingdoms lived happily ever after.  The End.\\"<br />---------<br />Now that's over, the rest of us who love every detail that Martin has to show us can get on with enjoying the series for as long as it lasts.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I FIRST SAW AND EVENTUALLY BOUGHT THE FIRST SEASON FOF DOWNTON ABBEY LAST YEAR. I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON AND NOW OF COURSE LOOKING TOWARD THE THIRD. THE HOUSE RESIDENTS ARE ALL RICHLY WOVEN INTO EACH OTHERS' LIVES AND THE TRUE CARING AND CONCERN MOST HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER CARRIED INTO THE SECOND SEASON. I THINK THE DUKE AND DUCHESS ARE PLAYED TO PERFECTION; THE DAUGHTERS A GREAT BLEND OF PRIVILEGE AND HOW IT AFFECTS THEM. THE STAFF FROM THE LITTLE SCULLERY MAID TO CARSON THE STIFF-UPPER LIPPED MANAGER ARE ALL FANTASTIC. I LOVED SEEING O'BRIEN BECOMING MORE KIND IN THE SECOND SEASON AND EVEN AM STARTING TO NOT DISLIKE AS MUCH THOMAS EVEN THOUGH HE'S PRETTY SELF CENTERED. I LOVED THE ROMANCE OF MARY AND MATTHEW THINKING THE LAST SCENE OF THE SEASON WAS THE MOST MAGICAL PROPOSAL I'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME. WATCHING THE DAUGHTERS MATURE IN THE SECOND SEASON WAS FANTASTIC AND WHILE I LOATHED EDITH'S JEALOUSY IN THE FIRST SEASON I CAN SEE HER PAYING DEARLY THE REST OF HER LIFE FOR IT. AND SYBIL LEAVING WITH THE IRISHMAN--WELL THAT WAS A SURPRISE. NATURALLY I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL TERRIBLY SAD FOR MR. BATES AND ANNA BOTH CHARACTERS WHO DESERVE RESPECT JUST FOR THE DIGNITY THEY'VE SHOWN THROUGH THE HARD TIMES. I DO HOPE THE EARL'S INFLUENCE GETS BATES A NEW TRIAL. HOWEVER,  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED HE NEVER SAID HE DIDN'T DO IT? THEN THE DECEASED MRS. BATES PROBABLY GATHERED ENEMIES BY THE SCORE. ALREADY ON PINS AND NEEDLES WAITING FOR SEASON 3.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  In fact, I purchased the next two in the series before I had finished it!<br /><br />I was totally amazed.  This is not the genre that I usually enjoy, but I was spellbound by the story line and caught up in the fast paced action.<br /><br />Definitely not just for teens!
0446547654|1.0|There is little point to describing the plot. Although the author seems to want to paint a subtle picture of the unexpectedly complex inner lives of his small-town characters, opting for a narrative form that moves from the point of view of one character to another, the plot is really driven by bizarrely unnecessary violence. You get the sense after a few of these twists that the author could only see a short distance into his characters' minds (possibly because they were cliches cobbled together from made-for-TV dramas) and, unable to push the plot along without that vision, opted to throw at them one awkwardly constructed physical threat after another. Add to that more than a little deus ex machina, some mystical gibberish, and utter predictability, and you have the literary equivalent of cheap bad take-out. It feels good while you're eating, and you saved some money, but in the end you feel guilty and a little ill.<br /><br />In its favor is the fact that this book is short and a very easy read. That and the occasional hint at some emotional depth in one of his two main characters, combined with a need I had today to do something other than work, made this occasionally enjoyable. I might even have given it a slightly higher ranking had the ending not been such a huge disappointment. I won't give it away, but if you find yourself about 70% of the way through the book, you'll probably be able to guess what that ending is. Yes, he really is going there. And no, you really have no reason to follow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't think I'd like these books and, despite recommendations from my friends, I resisted for a long time. Because the movie is coming to theaters soon and I prefer to read the book before seeing the associated movies, I finally gave in. I'm SO glad I did. This book was amazing - right from the first page, I got completely sucked in and couldn't stop reading. I read the trilogy so quickly, I was disappointed when I finished the third (Mockingjay) because I didn't know what to read next! \\"Hunger\\" describes perfectly how I felt while reading...I had an insatiable hunger to find out about the characters and their survival. I read all night some nights and fought the desire to call into work so I could keep reading. Nice Job, Ms Collins. I look forward to reading your next novel!

I was interested in learning about Hoover, his role in creating the FBI, American history, and the like but it's focused on speculation about Hoover and as anyone can see, this is the homosexual activist's propaganda to promote their perversion or same-sex marriage, etc. I'm REALLY disappointed in Clint Eastwood! Overall the movie was boring, annoying, and disgusting watching the two men interact.
B006TGWY3K|5.0|I actually stumbled on this group while perusing the Heavy Metal releases for January. This particular sight was streaming the entire album online so after a few listens I was hooked and downloaded the album.  I'm an old school metalhead growing up listening to bands like Ratt, Queensryche, and Dio.  I don't really care for the Metal the young ones listen to now with the low grunting vocals and downtuned guitars.  Lacuna Coil is the exception.  I really love the vocal interplay between Scabbia and Ferro - very refreshing. Couple that with songs loaded with metal hooks and polished production and you're certain to please the old metalheads like me.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton is about a small town girl named Sophia, who is an outcast in her town because she is Wiccan.  Having a stressful life and hearing constant noise/static in her head she decides to cast a spell to attempt to relieve the noise, which only opens a whole new world for her.<br /><br />The Forever Girl is a extremely great read, filled will urban fantasy and paranormal romance.  The characters were well written and interesting. The entire book held my interest and I enjoyed Rebecca's writing style. The story was fresh, original, and exciting.  I love that the romance wasn't instant \\"love at first sight\\" and that it took some time to develop. However, the ONLY thing I wasn't sure about in the book was the time lapses, there was a few..\\"a few weeks or months later\\" I understand that we don't need to know every single detail of what went on during those months, but it still left me feeling like we might have missed something.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend The Forever Girl, I rate it 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait to read more from Rebecca Hamilton.

I can think up dozens of awesome features that I really think should some day be developed, but at the end of the day, I also need a product that solves real and urgent problems now. So next time when I have to prioritize what feature to develop, I'll be taking a close look at the workflow of my users before starting to code anything.<br /><br />So do I recommend this book? Well given its length, I think that every developer, even when you're not at a startup should take the time to read this book if only to give them some ammo during the next meeting about which features to implement. While this probably isn't the book about Lean Startups, its definitely a good introduction.
B006OFN0BQ|1.0|Terrible. I was interested in learning about Hoover, his role in creating the FBI, American history, and the like but it's focused on speculation about Hoover and as anyone can see, this is the homosexual activist's propaganda to promote their perversion or same-sex marriage, etc. I'm REALLY disappointed in Clint Eastwood! Overall the movie was boring, annoying, and disgusting watching the two men interact. As the other reviewer wrote, Hollywood liberals and perverts strike again!
B001HN6922|5.0|Great buy as 5 year old grandson wanted this movie to replace his other one that cracked.  He loves this movie and it arrived on his birthday.  What a great suprise for him.
B005OOSPZO|4.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great movie historical movie with excellent sound and video, but crappy sub-titles.  The cool thing about this version is it has both Japanese and Theatrical versions, and I like that it has the small picture book.<br /><br />My main complaint is the sub-titles on the Japanese version are not always visible.  One would think the film editors at 20th Century Fox could have made sure that the bottom of the sub-titles didn't get cut-off the bottom of the screen!  One can see the top of sentences when the text is long enough to have two lines of text, but the bottom line is cut-off.  On one line of text sub-titles, one can't see any of the text at all.  This is a major problem, because on the Japanese version there are a lot of conversations between Japanese speaking actors, that unless one understands Japanese language he will not be able to understand what the actors are saying.<br /><br />I watched the only the Japanese version, because I had not seen that one yet, but I sure hope the problem is on the Theatrical version too!
1932100660|1.0|I was thoroughly disappointed in this book.  The author wrote one very long argument for a vegan lifestyle.  The title is somewhat misleading, as he really does not talk much about the China study.  This book reads like a vendetta against the government, medical community, industry and scientific community.<br /><br />Everybody knows that vegetables are good for you.  The argument against dairy is a little harder to understand.  I have been to China and Japan.  The absence of dairy in Japan results in a serious problem with osteoporosis, as one can observe simply by walking down the street.  As for China, the severe pollution in the air, water and food supply, coupled with the abundance of heavy smokers, makes me wonder what conclusions we as Americans can draw from the health status of the Chinese.<br /><br />Finally, the caution against fish is very puzzling.  How does the author explain the large number of centenarians in Japan that have nourished themselves primarily with white rice (pure carbs) and fish (the dreaded animal protein)?<br /><br />To me, the book reads like a manifesto.  The author apparently has an ax to grind with a lot of people.  Unfortunately, the title does not adequately describe what is really in the book.  I would definitely pass this one up.  Maybe useful if you want to become vegan and need a rationale for when you visit the in-laws for dinner.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is cool because I can download games for free but I have to earn them. I think it is fun to earn them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is relaxing and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice puzzle game. The music is soothing.  Each puzzle is easy to restart to try again. There are hints if you get stuck. I will be buying the other Quell game when I am done with this one. (Although I imagine I will go through the games again. The bubble is so much fun to play with.) I had no problems with my Kindle Fire playing this game and (so far) only one request for a rating.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is soooo fun you'll love it, it will get your brain going and most certainly wont waist your time!!!!
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I have placed an order and am still waiting for this album to be shipped to me. I can't help but keep sampling this cd online while waiting for my copy...this is by far the best cd by Glasper.I have all his four previous CDs but this one is something else,no need to skip a track. This guy's a genius, his music never disappoints.I also like the featured artists, Bilal, Mosdef, Shafiq Hussayn, Erykah Badu, Meshell Ndegeocello and more.this is a must have
B0031RS2HC|5.0|i enjoyed this book from the first chapter it moved along very fast and was hard to put down.A Really good read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is my 3rd favorite game,but it's still awesome.I got up to 637,000 points.I also noticed a minigame that's worth 1,000,000 points today
B003L77FYS|5.0|This series is one of my all time fav's....The charisma between charecters is amazing. They have so many monments that either make me laugh right out loud or cheer for the two of them to be together. This is one of the most well rounded series I've watched in a while. I know some people are sick of crime drama's but this is a stand alone. It's origional and funny and wonderfully written.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|All of the photography is supposedly done by a guy selected at random to videotape testimonials at a party in New York City. During the party a really shocking event happens which scatters the partygoers and the videographer faithfully follows one group through all of their adventures in New York City as it is being destroyed around them.<br /><br />The movie is intentionally choppy as one would expect under those circumstances and succeeds in presenting a sufficiently interesting story line that held my attention all the way through. As with most movies of this type you have to accept the basic assumptions of the movie to tolerate what happens but if you can the movie is pretty effective at telling its story.<br /><br />The audience for this movie will be the sci-fi adventure, fantasy and horror movie crowd. Not a bad movie if you go in with your eyes open to the eccentricities it includes.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout is my favorite of Jillian's. It is great for beginners. Push yourself through and don't give up. Not to where you hurt yourself take baby steps if needed to get through it.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I don't say that lightly! I love this show for so many reasons! I love the plots and the sub-plots, I also love how well created, and the depth, that every single character has on this show. Yes, some of these characters may be more prone to be the bad guy, but I enjoy how ever now and then you will see a whole other side to them. All the flaws from and all the good things that goes into creating each one of these characters is truly amazing to me. LOVE LOVE LOVE this show. I am sad that I have to wait a whole year (Jan. 2013) for season 3 to be released to the States. *Sigh* what's a girl to do without her Downton? I guess I will have to start over from season 1 and re-enjoy each episode again (yay, it's that good).
B006ON41FC|5.0|great app really fun good for passing time.  great if you enjoy casual games... enjoy playing this game for hours on end
0307352145|4.0|In a world tha only seems interested in \\"people\\" people and loud assertive personalities, it's nice to be reminded of all the really successful introverts and their meaningful contributions to society. Sometimes I wonder if introverts were appreciated instead of marginalized the first words attributed to mass murderers wouldn't be, he was a loner.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|Woody Allen makes a nuthouse look sane.  Midnight in Paris is about a writer who stumbles upon literary greatness in the darkness of Paris at a vulnerable time in his life.  Whether you actually believe the man to see what he sees or not, Woody takes Owen Wilsons character and allows him to see whatever he wants and do whatever he wants... and that makes this a Woody Allen movie.  I guess it's nice living in Hollywood, putting all of your dreams and nightmares into a reality they call A MOVIE.
B006B9REH6|5.0|I was a bit put off by the two negative reviews of the Bluray version by others and initially purchased the DVD/CD version. Prior to opening it I watched a U-Tube review of both, returned the DVD and took a risk on the Bluray. I AM SO GLAD I DID THIS! The Bluray sound is FANTASTIC! Even in Dolby 5.1 I have no complaints. The sound was great even on a cheap 5.1 system and superior on my better quality Sony Amp 7.2 system running at 5.1. I agree the photography in some of the videos is not up to Bluray quality, but it does stream at 1080 and is good. Towards the end of the concert and in other shots it is great quality. The price difference between Bluray and DVD is not much and again I recommend taking a chance on the Bluray disc set. You won't be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I woke up this morning to my kindle with a reminder about reading the Bible for about five minutes a day is better than nothing! I loved that! and I love the fact that it will read it aloud too!
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|The series takes time to understand the various characters in the program and injects new characters in just about every episode.  Great acting by some actors that have not been seen in awhile.  Enjoyed all 12 hours, looking forward to the next season!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love these types of games that include varius puzzles and this one takes it step further by needing to change scenery to complete some puzzles. Beautiful art work and great fun!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it is addictive, a good time waster, some games are good while others are terrible and almost impossible to complete.
0439023521|5.0|loved it read it in a day and now enjoying everyone else in the house fight over who gets it next
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most games are fun some are lame but it is adicting. a good time killer. I would not pay tor it but. for free its keeper
B002TZ3C8G|4.0|A very well written and very easy to read book.  Though this is a thriller/crime theme, it contains a hint of futurism in references to biological warfare.  Our hero, a New York cop, has to weave his way past serious deception in finding the murderers of his friends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of solitaire was really fun to play. I thoroughly enjoyed the simplicity of it. It's a must have app!
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Tom Meets Summer, a girl who is independant and isn't looking for anything serious in a relationship. Add 500 days and you have the ups and downs of a relationship told in a realistic way thats not too sugar coated by many love stories. kind of a sad movie but the ending I felt was rewarding for both charectors, I know some reviewers expected something else but I thought it was handled well. A good movie to deal with a breakup.
006197806X|5.0|I absolutely LOVED the first book. By itself, it made a great story, so I was so excited when I found out there would be a sequel. This book kept me guessing and left me on the edge. I love the way she paces the story, and she has such a way with words. Her endings are always amazing- not just in plots, but in the prose, as well. I think my heart may have skipped a few beats with the ending- I can't wait to see what happens, so PLEASE hurry and release the next book! \\"Pandemonium\\" was excellent, and I rank this trilogy high with \\"The Hunger Games\\" (Suzanne Collins)and \\"Divergent\\" (Veronica Roth).
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I am new the whole Blu Ray thing, but I've found out early that some movies can transform your living area into a movie theatre.  This is one of those movies.  The scenes shot in the IMAX format are amazing and ledger's portrayal of the Joker will forever make this a must own.
B0049P1M0Y|5.0|Even if your 50, if you never read this, pick up this classic story.  I love reading it.  Keeps me on the edge of my seat throughout the book.
B004IZMQI2|4.0|All artist's need help with motivation at some point. This was a good quick self-help for getting going. It's not really a war of art, more like a war with self. And one hopes the art comes out on top.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I went through 2 other iPhone cases in a year's span before I finally settled on this one.  My first (Incipio Double Cover) had every plastic corner chipped off over time due to poor design.  My second (Speck Candyshell) had its rubber bumpers peeling off within the first few weeks of buying it.  Frustrated, I decided I wanted a one piece, hard case, with a slim fitting and the AmazonBasics case has been perfect so far.  Not a single complaint from me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is fun to play on the go and I enjoy playing some of the games with my friends while bored. I do have to agree that it was definitely a lot better before the update though.
B004ZNANZA|4.0|Volume. Pure and simple. It's the same with all of these new remasters. I have to turn my volume up to 30 to hear this when I only have it up to 15 or so on other stuff.<br /><br />I know there's a segment of the audiophile community that HATE the \\"loudness wars\\", as they call it. I don't mind it as long as it doesn't sound all distorted like the last Metallica release. But this is way too quiet sounding.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I am so excited to have this set delivered, it's like waiting for Christmas to arrive as a child.  Why so many complainers about aspect ratio and crystal clear audio and visual.  It's the freaking Godfather, show some respect.  $25 Gold Box, nice job Amazon!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I could not put this book down!!! I read it in one day, loved it! I have to say that Nicholas Sparks is by far my favorite writer!!
B006VR65OQ|2.0|This is a mediocre movie that was unbelievably boring and over-rated. I would not recommend it.  I don't understand why it was nominated for an Academy Award. Pure politics. This was Brad Pitt's worst role.
0062082353|5.0|My Godson is a Navy EOD currently on his third tour. Kris Kyle is the real deal, a great read.
B006C5FWH8|5.0|I already gave the free version a review with a recommendation to buy the full version, so now I just figured id add a 5 star review to the paid app because its worth every penny and more, plus I heard an upgrade with new maps is coming out soon. its space hulk for your kindle, but 80$ less and no set up required. top notch stuff, thank you devs
0525478817|5.0|This book made me cry. Like, the kind where I couldn't stop and it was endless and I felt almost physically damaged by the novel.<br /><br />So, yeah, it's not exactly beach reading.<br /><br />But what makes this book so much more important than just an ordinary \\"kids with cancer\\" book is that it's funny. It's funny and witty and the voice of the narrator, Hazel, is so incredibly unique and often just so blunt. She's the kind of person you want to be best friends with and Augustus Waters, her love interest, is the kind of boy you want to marry.<br /><br />To write a brief summary, Hazel is a teenager diagnosed with an incurable cancer that she will most likely die from one day pretty soon. The only thing keeping her alive is a \\"miracle\\" drug that doesn't allow her tumors to grow any larger but doesn't exactly shrink them either. When forced to attend a cancer support group meeting, she sees Augustus Water, who is in remission from osteosarcoma and is only there to support his friend Isaac. They meet, fall in love, and it is indescribably beautiful.<br /><br />This book is important in that it can help anyone, including those not facing a serious illness, confront the inevitability of the end of their own existence. That there will be a time when no one remembers you. Hazel and Augustus have conflicting views on this subject and it makes for an interesting and insightful peek into the thought processes of those who deal with the thought of death almost always.<br /><br />It's the kind of novel you can fall in love with. It's well worth the read and is proof that John Green truly is one of the best authors writing today, young adult or not.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great app. Cant wait to use it in church. When Pastor calls for scripture, I'll be like tap, tap BAM! While congregation is rustling pages, searching
B005D51II0|3.0|The Decca Sound is a 50 CD sampler of Decca's classical catalog that covers from the 1950's to 2009 and features a majority of digital recordings from artists still active on the label, with some rare analog masters scattered through the box.<br /><br />This set follows the format of the DG 111 box sets, from the same parent company, Universal/Vivendi, which are fine for what they are a very large \\"sampler\\" of their current catalog.<br /><br />The quality of the recordings are fanatstic, due to many of them being recorded in the last 30 years with state of the art equipment.<br /><br />The older LP based albums have bonus filler, sourced from other Decca CD reissues of the original albums, and it seems more like a taste of one of the artist specific \\"Remastered\\" box sets Decca also releases. The newer recordings are just copies of the originally released CDs and have no bonus material, even if the original CDs were short on time.<br /><br />If you like Decca classical artists and are looking for new music this is a fine introduction to the label. The clam shell box itself is nice and the booklet has the full recording info on each CD, along with multi language essays on the Decca label and staff. To me the booklet is the best part of the set, followed by the box that holds the CDs.<br /><br />The box is set up alphabetically by artist, conductor or composer, and requires the booklet to get more info on the CD contents, than just the original album cover on the front of the mini LP replica sleeve.<br /><br />If you didn't know about the \\"alphabetical\\" ordering it would seem like the box was randomly packed until you see it's following the order in the book, which jumps arounds from artist to artist. Which must be why they numbered the CDs, why can't they put the recording info on the back of the CD sleeve and not just the song titles, and picture so small you can't make it out, of the \\"bonus material\\", forcing you to use the book just to find out when it was recorded?<br /><br />The set is frustrating by requiring the booklet for info that could have been on the back of the sleeve, instead of a blurb about the original release, which should have been in the booklet.<br /><br />The question is do I really need a potentially \\"Collectable\\" alphabetical Greatest Hits set of 50 different Decca artists to add to my classical CD library?<br /><br />Personally, I would rather avoid samplers and stick to collections. For the price of this set I could have gotten the \\"Complete Solti Wagner\\" Decca set and a couple other conductor based collections that really would have added to my library and not just a 50 CD tease of what's available from the Decca catalog.<br /><br />The box seems like something a Decca salesperson would give to a big client in appreciation of a large order, more than the label anniversary retrospective it was advertised as.<br /><br />The 3 star rating is for the content of the box, which I found unfocused and disappointing, when my preorder finally arrived. I wanted to like this set, but it's just not up to the prerelease hype.<br /><br />If your looking for a well done Decca sampler this might be worth investing in, there are a couple specific albums that are out of print and on here, that are pricey in the 2nd market.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 6 months later  >>>>>>>>>>>>>><br /><br />After living with this for a while I wanted to confirm my earlier impression of the set.<br /><br />It's gone from the $3 a disk at preorder down to a little over $2 and the limited edition seems to be limited to as many as they can sell.<br /><br />My real issue is unlike the superior Sony RCA Living Stereo box, a premium box set with a book containing all the original liner notes, or the Mercury Living Presence Box which cover a limited time frame and both feature broad collections of a couple conductors. This is a random collection too broad to be effective. I find I listen to these CDs very little and what I did like I went out and got the mutli CD Remastered discount Conductor based collections sampled in this box.<br /><br />Its still new, but already a dust collector.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|A very disappointing and boring movie. Especially the first half, the pace is too slow for audience to care. And the flashback narrative makes the story chaotic and draw-out. For all your people out there who want to watch Gina Carano, there are not many fighting scenes in the movie. That did make me wonder why they cast her in the first place. The movie was only in my local theater for one week, so I have to spend $7 on train in addition to the movie ticket. After I finished watching, I understood why it made so little money at boxoffce.<br /><br />The casts are talented, but that doesn't make the movie much more watchable since they weren't given much to do.<br /><br />Bottom line is, ordinary people won't enjoy this movie, and neither will most extraordinary people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this solitwire game and its free free that's awesome it was worth spending my time to get it.
B001Q94TQA|4.0|This is a great film for musicians, getting a glimpse into the collaborative energy of the creative process.<br />Blu-Ray menus for extras do not work in my newer Sony player, which is why I dropped rating to 4 stars.<br />I can live with it, though, as I loved the film!
0060936223|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best pieces of writing I have read in many years. The story of Patti and Robert is that of an unconditional love, friendship and companionship in a very tumultuous political and musical time period.<br /><br />It is an absolute pleasure to read about all of this from the perspective of one of the last great rock and roll poets of the age. Every fan of New York, poetry, music and art should have a copy of this excellent book in their collection.
B007G5FX4K|5.0|All I can say is that this song is one hot track. It is a definite club hit. Its Sorry meets Act of Contrition. Although it is not a drastic change or experimental in any way, it is still a great song to listen & dance to. Madonna wants to party and have fun and this song is a perfect example. Girl Gone Wild is about letting go and getting wild. Just BUY IT, play it LOUD and enjoy the song!

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I have a number of Macs and Magic Mice. The Mobee Magic Charger will not charge one of my older MM but works flawlessly with a newer one I have. When I could not get the Mobee charger to work I went through all the problem solving steps listed by others. Finally I charged the battery pack outside the MM. But when I inserted the fully charged battery pack the MM still would not keep a connection. Next I inserted the battery pack in a newer MM and it connected immediately to my Mac and charged on the base. It has operated flawlessly for several weeks. It keeps this MM charged to 100%.<br /><br />I suspect those with difficulties (after verifying that the pack is inserted properly) may have an older Magic Mouse. That would make charging problems and connection problems a function of the mouse not Mobee.<br /><br />I am giving a 5 star because the product is working as advertised and I am well pleased.

B00433SVME|5.0|The key is death. Forgetting this is what makes life an illusion.<br /><br />Lie down, close your eyes and try to die. Feel the body giving up and drifting away, gather the strength to focus, not to pass out, to stay alert so you can preserve yourself.<br />Maintain control in the face of the most elemental fear with an irrevocable determination to fight till the very end and not to succumb to nature. With the death of the body the significance of time becomes minimal - you're still perceiving it but you know it'll be gone, too. You realize that your life was nothing and that you got it all wrong.<br /><br />You were dead and now you have the chance to live.<br /><br />You remember only the small things now. The smallest things you missed; you realize how and where you screwed up. You realize: it was all about control. The control you need now to gather the power to survive this trauma. The rest was just a setting: parents, lovers, enemies, religion, kids, career, home; sogar dein Auto!<br /><br />If only you had been aware of this!<br /><br />You realize that this is your last chance to control your destiny. Not to forget! Not to let the experience overwhelm you, not to let it put you to sleep.<br />You understand: if you identify with what you experience, you are lost. To preserve yourself you must dominate your experience! You! Your mind screams: this is not me!!! Whatever you see and feel: this is not me!<br /><br />You have always been alone!<br /><br />And you remember the small details: the conflicts, the love, the hate, the anger, the pride, the shame, the guilt, the lies; ...and the fear! That sneaky fear that remained under your radar but you always felt and that you let yourself get used to; all the instances when you forgot, fell asleep and let yourself be used by thoughts and emotions that you never owned.<br /><br />You were owned!<br /><br />You have been weak and stupid. You just didn't know!!! The question of control never even came up. Your whole life was a void and now you see that it amounted to nothing. Only now that it's gone it has become clear: this moment is the point. This moment has always been the point from the very beginning. What will you do? What can you do?<br /><br />Are you going to fall asleep now or triumph?<br /><br />Nobody really understands the greatest minds without this vantage point. Without experiencing this ultimate struggle, everything is just an abstraction, an illusion.<br /><br />Marcus Aurelius starts his thoughts by taking stock of what he learned from whom. Taking stock of the \\"small things\\" where control and balance must be exercised:<br /><br />Taking the time; thinking before speaking; not to speak unnecessarily; being considerate; not to get angry because of small things; not to be judgmental; not to daydream; not to be passionate; not to succumb to fame and fortune; how to receive compliments and criticism on an even keel; acting in accordance with one's own nature; not to identify with others, not to be concerned with what others think, understanding and appreciating differences and many other things that require you to use all your powers to preserve yourself, just like on your death bed when it becomes clear what the stakes are.<br /><br />The greatest lives and the greatest works all exude an intimate aura of death.<br /><br />This vantage point is what turns mundane activities into rituals and this is what makes the differentiated man. NOT the 80/20 rule, not the ability to introduce balanced scorecards, not the brand message (God forbid: personal band), not executive education programs, celebrity coaches or books by Steve Jobs or Jack Welsh, not a dedication to perfection in product development, not the value investing \\"philosophy\\", not anything in the business domain: these are just settings.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Ok, I've just finished reading this book and it's SO DEPRESSING!!!, I have no problem with sad stories, it bothers me that there are many books and movies containing cheerful and lame endings filled with dull happiness and nonsense, but this book cross a little bit the line of sadness, (SPOILERS AHEAD) Katniss isn't only brutally injured physically (which happens constantly throughout the books) but in this book she is completely insane, somehow understandable due to the terrible events in her short life, but at the end she is destroyed beyond repair.<br /><br />The characters changed so much, definately not the same Katniss, and Peeta is completely unrecognizable (because of the hijacking, of course), I also find myself losing interest sometimes, the pace of narration in the other 2 books is impecable, in here it's not even close.<br /><br />And finally Prim's death is incredibly sad, and I don't understand the ending with Gale, it made no sense he abandoned Katniss like that, maybe it was because his embarrassment for creating the weapons which later damaged Prim, but still it wasn't directly his fault, and he definitely could have fix things up whit Katniss... And also her mother leaving her alone in the 12. The book is readable, don´t get me wrong, it isn't bad I had a good time reading it, this review mostly emphasizes the bad parts, it is good, but it definitely let you with a sour taste.
B0054LVP3Q|2.0|I figured out the ending in the first 50 pages!  The author tried to `trick`us with the memory loss theme, but the end result was so obvious that I skipped most of the book and just read the last 10 pages or so.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|Enjoyed this quite a bit. Good performances. Very well shot. And best of all, a script with some real thought put into the story. The filmmakers really bring you something you've never seen before. It also has several WOW moments. No spoilers here. Just watch it.
B005GQ5HB0|3.0|Interesting read, well written although lost momentum 3/4 way in, then picked up.  Haven't seen the movie and think it must have been compelling.  Take the time and read it!

B0077SGMXM|5.0|its super fun.  I really like the fun variatee of courses.  every one should like this game and deffinetley get it.
B005FITIDC|4.0|Here is a great story about a real-life person and ongoing social issues. It is about a Pennsylvania biker and former alcohol/drug-addict ex-convict, who is converted to Christianity, goes to Uganda and South Sudan, and decides to dedicate his life to saving children, building an orphanage there. His name is Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler) and he intends to protect these children, some of whom are abducted by a militant group the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army), and he does so, no matter what it takes.<br /><br />I will not discuss here the serious issue of \\"child soldiers\\" that has been around for many years, a topic that has been also taken up in such films as \\"Johnny Mad Dog\\" and \\"Blood Diamond.\\" Director Marc Forster provides enough information for us to understand what Childers aka Machine Gun Preacher does to rescue the children in the social context of Africa and its political situations. The film includes several action set-pieces in which Childers fights back the attacking soldiers, but I think they are one or two too many. Violence is discreetly presented, but what is suggested is sometimes shocking.<br /><br />Gerard Butler, charismatic as ever, carries the film throughout almost single-handedly. Audiences may either admire or dislike the character he plays, but either way they will be fascinated by his strong performance. Part shot in South Africa, the on-location photography is credible. Souléymane Sy Savané as Deng, a Sudanese telling Sam the harsh reality of his land is impressive.<br /><br />But most supporting characters are underwritten. It seems the subplot of Sam's friend Donnie (talented Michael Shannon, wasted) is heavily shortened, and so does the back story of Sam's wife Lynn Childers (Michelle Monaghan), even though some (including me) may find her character more intriguing than Sam Childers himself. Kathy Baker as Sam's mother is almost non-existent.<br /><br />Based on Sam Childers' memoir \\"Another Man's War\\" (which I haven't read),\\"Machine Gun Preacher\\" is an average biographical film with a powerhouse performance from the lead. But to really know this complicated character, perhaps we should read the book first.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got this as a free paid app of the day and have been enjoying it so much ever since.  It's the kind of game that is just challenging enough, but in a very relaxing way.  I don't like very hard games that leave me feeling frustrated.  I usually stop playing those kind of games and just delete the app from my Kindle Fire. The graphics are beautiful and it has a cultural aspect and feel because of the maps, artifacts and geographical references. I'm very glad I picked up this app when it was offered for free.  I see that they have a free version as well.  I heartily recommend it to everyone.
1401307450|4.0|Overall the book was very entertaining.  The RHCP have had a wild ride with drugs, sex, and rock n roll over the years as explained in this book.  Anthony talks about his struggle with addiction, his issues with women, and problems with other band members.  He also tells some stories that I never would have though possible, such as the time he met the Dalai Lama. At times it did seem to get a little slow because it was a little over explained on some issues.  However the good outweighed the bad.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A wonderful 'must read' book.  This book has lots of light-hearted, funny moments, but combines well with some very thought provoking and sad moments.  I've not read any of Jojo Moyes other books, but will be looking to see what else she has after reading this - really enjoyed it.
B003L20ICE|5.0|My lesbian co-work told me about this movie. I found it on Amazon and ordered it. I really.... really enjoyed watching this movie. It was very touching.
0142429112|3.0|While the cd kept me mostly interested, I have to say that the romance was a bit much and ultimately, boring.  Another theme that repeated until I could take it no more was Diana being in bed, cared for by Matthew.  This happened even after Matthew was almost assuredly dead, only to be saved by Diana.  But who, at the end of the day, was in bed, in and out of consciousness, being cared for by Matthew:  yes, Diana.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is an awesome cd!  David Lee Roth sounds great.  Eddie's playing shows why he ís and will always be King Edward the Ass-Kicker and a guitar legend :). The music sounds fresh and like classic Van Halen at the same time!  It is great to hear a cd that just ROCKS!  GREAT CD!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is entertaining. Makes you compete against yourself.Also keeps me yearning for the next game of Spider. Great fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Highly recommend this version! A diamond in the rough, a true gem of a game, in spades! Have a heart and join the club so you're able to have a hand in this straight up awesome version of solitaire. :)
B006W0QOF2|3.0|What a disappointment. Thought this would be a thrill ride with intelligence. However, it's just a dumb ride with one or two thrills. Look elsewhere if you want intelligence.<br /><br />Basically a few car chases, slasher type gore, another hackneyed mafia-owed-money crime plot, an intrusive 80's soundtrack to make up for the lack of dialogue and another bad-guy-wants-to-settle-down `protagonist'. And that's it. Horribly shallow, devoid of anything meaningful, the men are all pathetic and uninteresting and the key female may as well be a mannequin with a face painted on for all she has to say and do in the film. Shame. No real character inspection of the main guy. Who is he? Why is he? What's his background?<br /><br />The tone is confused; the retro 80's style is only there make it seem a little different, it adds nothing of importance; the violence is horribly unnecessary, graphic and nasty; it seems to want to be seen as  artistic, introspective, even poetic...ha ha ha! - watch something like the terrific The Assassination of Jesse James to see how that's done.<br /><br />Three stars for the enjoyably suspenseful beginning and the tense heist. After that, you may as well turn off. It starts off well and interestingly and main character seems as if he will be interesting to be around but isn't, and the whole thing soon degenerates into dumb crime gangster mafioso movie territory with only a retro styling to try and separate it.
0374275637|5.0|Outstanding guide to our own mushy grey and white inner workings! He manages to make difficult and advanced material easily understood and then includes reviews at the end of each chapter - brilliantly done!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very very fun and frustrating. me and my friend always play. me gusta mucho. I recommend to everyone to try this game. adios
B001F12J48|1.0|I just picked up my 3D Blu-Ray Player and new Samsung 3D Plasma TV and was very anxious to score some cool 3D movies to watch, which are still very rare and pricey. My fault I didn't pay close enough attention to the descriptipn and the reviews.This is a great little movie, which I already owned, it is not the new blu ray 3D version that requires special hardware, it can be watched on any tv, and the 3D is hokey at best. Just be careful when looking and know that any new 3D movie is in Blu-Ray and will say it requires 3D TV, 3D Blu-Ray Player with active shutter glasses.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|when I installed it on my computer, it didn't work. I can't delete the software because I &quot;don't have permission&quot; to delete it. I have to wipe my computer clean now. I like evernote for my kindle but not anything else.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty cool app because it is free, yet there are so many games! so yeah, it is something i would recommend to other people!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Well written and researched.  It provides information for any introverts and the extroverts who love them.  I should think that Corporate America should take a page from this book and change their cowboy ways.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Excellent little suite of network tools! I definitely recommend checking it out. Works great on Kindle Fire too. Not bad for free.
0312330537|5.0|What a story.  I read it myself about 4 years ago and gifted my copy away.  I bought a second copy for my girlfriend to read.  I would like to read it again sometime.  Such a big story!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The games are based on point system. You start out with so many games and must gain points to unlock more. Also the controls are horrible and it lags. You drag hour finger across the screen, you have to wait for the object to catch op. Purposely makes the characters move slow so you have to keep trying in order to get the points. PLUS, this app is very very very ad friendly if you know what I mean. (Ads pop up after every gameplay)
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love this game. Played it all the way through without a single problem on my G2 with Android 2.3. This game won't even last 5 minutes before freezing on my Galaxy Nexus. Peggle does the same. C'mon PopCap! Fix yo shiz!
0545425115|1.0|Bad book. Just the idea of it sickens me. Can't we write better novels than this? What has this 2012 world come to?
B00006FDCD|5.0|This is a terrifying story about a small town in Maine where children disappear every 27 years and the killings go on for 12 months or more. This has gone on since recorded history but people seem to forget the horrible events.<br /><br />A group of children live though a horrendous event in fighting apparitions and the creature that they call \\"It\\". They agree to return and fight again if the creature is not really dead.<br /><br />A summons comes to them all 28 years later to return to the little town as it looks like \\"It\\" has returned....<br /><br />This movie is based on the book of the same title by Stephen King. It is one of the scariest of his novels and the movie is the same macabre story graphically told. It is so frightening that you will be afraid of sewers and clowns for some time to come.<br /><br />I have to say that I enjoyed the book more that the movie and I experienced more than once that the hair on the back of my neck stood up while reading the book. This is a spooky and scary story. The movie is good and deserves recognition but the book is better. I still gave the movie 5 stars as I am such a Stephen King fan I enjoy everything that he has written and the resulting movies that are made from his books.<br /><br />I recommend that you get this movie and also read the book. You will enjoy both of them!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An absolutely wonderful book which went to my heart immediately<br />It is a big story about life, love and death with young and very wise persons.<br />This book will shine forever in your memory.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Like \\"Ender's Game\\" for Sci Fi, or \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" in fantasy this book and series will be around and read a long time from now. Its not just a flash in the pan, fad. Its a well written story with classic and enduring themes.<br />Comparing it to the very popular Twilight books. This book is 1000x a better written and more enjoyable story. Its richer, deeper, and more satisfying.<br />The movie comes out in less than a month. Without a doubt the book and the movie will be significantly different. The book is the perspective of Catniss Everdeen. A lot of the story goes on in her head. Her thoughts, her feelings, and such. That alone will not translate into a movie. Some people will be disapointed I am sure. Read the book first. Let the movie enhance the book and give it a diff. perspective and I think you will enjoy the movie more. Just remember that reading a book and watching a movie are two very different experiences, each able to touch you in different ways. It is like listening to your fav band live vs. a recording. Each has its benefits and limitations.<br />Happy Reading...
0439023513|3.0|Much like the second book, the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay, has a slow start.  The conditions and situations are so different from the first two books (in my opinion anyway) that it almost seems out of place.  It takes some adjusting, but you finally get a grasp on what is happening and it's not as hard to follow.  Some of the things happening in the last book with enrage you and you'll want to stop reading, but keep your cool and read on.  I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews stating that the author didn't quite know how to end the trilogy.  At times, nothing makes sense and all you can do is read until you understand what is going on again.  A great example of this is Chapter 25.  Chapter 25 was so confusing and jumbled and that's the point where the author started rushing.  After all the confusion at the start of 25 everything happens in a flash and at times it's hard to keep up.  It's like the author didn't know how to make any transitions and therefore everything is thrown in your face at once.  There are some good points to the book as well, not all of it is bad.  The whole action sequence of the taking of the Capitol is a good example.  Although I wan't too happy with the quality of the last book, I'm glad I kept reading until the final chapters.  For once, I could smile about Kantiss's decision when it comes to Peeta.  If Mockingjay hadn't ended the way it did, I don't think I could even look at the final book again.
0451169514|5.0|The town of Derry, Maine has a problem.  It seems that every 27 years or so children seem to disappear never to be found again.  This goes on for about a year or a little more and then the disappearances stop for 27 more years.<br /><br />A group of men return back to the town and suddenly old memories begin coming back.  Things they had forgotten and now wish that they had never remembered.  They know what it is and where it is, how they kill it is another matter.....<br /><br />This is one of Stephen King's most spine-chilling stories and it is one of his must read classics.  The memory of the terror that the children and men experience will stay with you for a long time.  This book is the reason you read horror stories, to be terrified of the dark and clowns!<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book!
0545265355|5.0|Great read? Could barely put them down! I also love the different point of view the writer used from the characters view.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the bible God's word helps me through every day.It gives me strength and helps me remember who I am in God.
0307593312|5.0|For many years it has been an outreach of mine to read International authors from Europe and Asia in particular.  Haruki Murikami's  1Q84 did not disappoint.  I have read most of his books and this one is truly his best to date.  He is well versed in literature, which is evident in his works, and very knowledgeable of politics and social occurences globally as well as locally (Japan).  Yes, it is over 900, and everyword is important.  Even though the book is lengthy, there are no extra words, it is almost perfect.  If you like the ending to be tied up in a neat bundle, well then this book might not satisfy, as it answers the most pressing questions, and true to the title it also leaves a few open ended for the reader to decide. This is a  must read![[ASIN:0307593312 1Q84]]
0316017922|5.0|The seller sent me a used book which appeared to be absolutely \\"new\\" and in perfect condition.  The shipment was very fast and in a well wrapped carton.  Outliers was an excellent and captivating read...I would highly recommend this seller for superior performance and truthful advertising.  I would recommend this book for readers and any level on business managment that want to succeed.  Cy Murphy
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Works great on my Samsung Galaxy S2. Tiles can be a bit small, but zoom helps a lot. Fun game overall, I would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A nice light read, very addictive.  I read the first one in one day, and quickly followed with the other two.  Would read more from this author.
B000SEFCD8|3.0|This is a great book for researching a specific topic; understanding why we act as we act in front of dogs and how it affects them. It has some insightful research data and Patricia McConnell writes from the point of view of the typical << dog lover >>. I am afraid though that she has been caught up in the fight between << positive >> dog training and << negative >> dog training. In that aspect her experience seems to me poor, due to her obvious nervousness over the word dominance. The title of the book is precise, the book is informative on the topic and that s why I give 3 stars. The advertisement and the marketing of the book as a dog training handbook though is a deceit.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|If you shy away from Stephen King books due to the blood and gore, this novel is for you.  There is violence, but nothing like what you'd expect.  Time travel is a bit difficult to pull off, but King does it well here.  It is a lengthy read, but you'll be finished in no time.  The story is incredibly interesting and keeps you cheering for the main character to finally have the life he's found in the past.  Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an incredibly amazing book!!! If you have not read The Hunger Games, you are truly missing out!!! Great job Suzanne Collins!!!!!!!!!!
1439153663|4.0|I had a hard time putting \\"Kitchen Help\\" down. The author examines slavery from the vantage point of an indebted white slave. Although her social position is similar to that of the black slaves, she neither finds acceptance with them nor with the free whites in her community. The book presents an interesting new perspective on an old theme.
B006ON41FC|4.0|A fun game. Kinda lags on my phone but it's not the game's fault I guess. Give it a try!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. Great reverse stereotyping and spoofing of the usual horror in the woods genre. Lots of scenes were familiar, but with different endings than you might expect.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|The book was written to appear as an intellectual exercise and seems to have pleased only the pseudo intellectuals. The real shame is that trees were wasted to publish this kind of truly bad writing, ... so many better authors and such a waste of a readers time. As I bought the kindle edition at least I didn't waste any trees only my resources.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|This movie was different if you know what I mean yes it was funny and a really great cast, I just wish it would be funnier and he would have funny comebacks but he didnt and that was kind if annoying,you should really rent the movie first and then see if you like It, It is a great movie to watch on long car rides. I liked it but I really didnt care for the ending but you really should get it a great addition to any movie library.;)
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I think this one of the best apps it is deffently worth the price. the only thing that is bad about this app you cant stream music. but over all this app is good.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I was on the app store looking for something fun, when I came acrros the #1 free game. the reveiws says ot was great, so I got it. I tried and loved it!
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|Just like the first two books of the series, this one did not disappoint with action and twists! I wish there could have been more books for the series because I read through them too quickly!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love it.... sooo fun, I'm completely hooked! running a restaurant is not as hard as you would think it would be.....
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Like it very much! Very detailed map. Navigation is smooth and comfortable. Precisely located my position on the map in my Kindle Fire (no GPS, no cellular connection!). Will make a diference for my next travel. Thank you guys!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Loved the second season of TVD!!  There's not a lot of special features, but what is there is very enjoyable and worth it.  Fantastic shows, brilliant writing, and the actors are wonderful on screen and off screen.
B00447L4JG|3.0|This game is pretty hard for a video game. Truthfully Im not a big game and this was a x mas gift
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are nice clean games that almost anyone at any age can play. some games can be educational and just plain fun. I would recommend this game to anyone
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book in the Hunger Games Series is great! Continue on your journey with Katniss Everdeen as she learns she is not out of danger yet. Even though she made it out of the arena,The Capital is not going to overlook how she got out!
B0061S073A|5.0|this app just made my kindle fire into a safe kid tablet. itself very comfortable recommending this to other parents.  lockdown everything and only approve kid friendly app. even disabled the wick.great app
B0076303RY|5.0|This show is a must. A family drama on a lovely estate. This show is well written and beautiful to look at.<br />The staff has tons of drama. The comic relief comes from grandma.
B006ON41FC|3.0|The game is very fun, but it continuously keeps asking you to rate it.  I would have given it a higher rating if it didn't
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a fascinating story which kept me intrigued all the way through.  Great perspective on living life with a terminal illness.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this case when I bought my Kindle Fire, so I have been using case and Kindle together since the first day.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with my purchase. It does exactly what it was intended to do: protect the expensive Kindle Fire and provide a stable platform for viewing. I also bought screen protectors for the Fire but have not needed them because this case does such a good job.<br /><br />I have no complaints, only a feature request for future redesigns: this excellent case would  be even better if it had a receptacle to store a stylus.<br /><br />The $29.95 I invested in this product has been exceptionally well-spent. I would buy another case in a heartbeat.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|When you watch a Bond movie you want and expect certain elements<br />This movie delivers what us Bond fans want.<br />Great fun, cleaver, sarcastic and pure Bond.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's about time that these movies were release on blu-ray. Can't wait. The studio and the director sure took there sweet time. I guess they wanted a bigger install base for the blu-ray market.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|A pretty neat concept, BUT<br /><br />The action was very scarce and there was no chemistry between the two main actors.  There was no emotional connection to any of the characters.  A back story involving the main character's father never panned out.  The dialogue was flat.<br /><br />If the movie was titled \\"running\\" it would have made sense, since all the characters do is run.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the challenge of the game. It takes me a bit to figures it out, but I love the game. I do not loose as much as I used to, lol.
0525423281|5.0|I loved this book, but, there's just one thing that's been buggingm e, something I have to get off my chest before I can move on with this review, 'Lola, stop being so confused and torn.  You know what you want, go for it!'<br /><br />Okay, sorry, I'm done now.  Then again, if Lola took my advice, almost half of this book would have disappeared, the characters would have been spared a lot of hand wringing and door slamming and the ending, sweetness with a pile of chocolate covered strawberries on top, wouldn't have been quite so adorable.<br /><br />But, other than that, I love this story.<br /><br />I love Lola, in spite of her wacky, second guessing and I flipping adored Cricket.  After reading Anna and the French Kiss, a great book that I thought took a while to reach the romancing, I didn't think I could like a character as much as Etienne, he became the epitome of male coolness.<br /><br />But Cricket has a geeky-handsome-boy-next-door charm that for me, was even more endearing than the smoldering, sophisticate, Etienne.<br /><br />I wont bother to synopsize the book, you can look that up right here on this page, you can even take a look inside the book to get a feel for Ms. Perkins writing (I always do that, you just never know and it always helps to read a few pages before jumping in with your credit card), but I will recap what turned out, for me at least, to be the best and brightest moment in the book, the part where I knew that Lola and Cricket were meant to be together, but also, that they should be together.<br /><br />Okay, here's another thing I have to say, \\"I HATE MAX.\\"  Sorry, didn't mean to shout it, just thinking about him, suddenly made my slight simmer boil up and over the rim  into a shout, he really inspires a lot of disgust in me.<br /><br />Now here's the cream, or as my true crime story loving friend would say, here's the chalk outline; Cricket and Lola talking about stuff, not anything life changing, it just is,<br /><br />\\"What's box?\\" I blurt.<br /><br />He's thrown.  \\"What?\\"<br /><br />I point at his hand \\"Read chapter twelve and buy shampoo, right?  What's box?\\"<br /><br />His right hand absentmindedly covers his left. \\"Oh Uh, I need to find one.\\"<br /><br />You know those books where the characters fall in love while walking along beaches and staring up at impossibly brilliant sunsets, this isn't that kind of story, it's about a girl, who loves the boy who lives next door.  Neither of them are billionaires, vampires or possessed of super strength, they just have love and as it turns out, that's all they need.<br /><br />Read this book, you won't be disappointed.blurt.<br /><br />He's thrown.  \\"What?\\"<br /><br />I point at his hand \\"Read chapter twelve and buy shampoo, right?

B004GTLFNW|4.0|Ever since I got into martial arts 8 years ago, I've been convinced that the absolutely best way to build functional fitness is through bodyweight exercises. I'd already read Brett Stewart's [[ASIN:1612430260 7 Weeks to Getting Ripped: The Ultimate Weight-Free, Gym-Free Training Program]], which also pretty decent, but Mark Lauren's book has become my goto resource.<br /><br />Who this book is for:<br />- people (no matter how fit or out of shape) who want to increase their level of general and/or functional fitness<br />- athletes who want to supplement their training (I'd also suggest [[ASIN:097462540X Crosstraining for Endurance Athletes: Building Stability, Balance, and Strength]], although it's not equipment-free)<br />- professionals (police officers, firefighters, etc.) who need to focus on functional fitness<br /><br />Who this book is not for:<br />- anyone who wants to bulk up or build strength beyond what a bodyweight routine can offer<br /><br />Unless we're talking about a professional bodybuilder or powerlifter, I see no reason why anyone would want to surpass the power/strength cap set by one's own body. I mean, if you can do some of the seriously impressive exercises in this book (such as flags, planche push ups, and handstand push-ups), why on earth would you want to push your body beyond that? However, if for some reason you do want more mass/strength but want to keep focusing on functional fitness, then maybe you could check out CrossFit, which adds weights to the equation - I've had no personal experience with it, but have been told it produces excellent results.<br /><br />My only gripe about the book (and the reason I deducted a star) is the very short mention of isometric exercises. IMHO, isometrics are some of the best equipment-free exercises you can do, especially considering the degree of difficulty will practically never decrease since it is dependent on one's current level of strength. I spent some time in rehab due to an injured knee, where the only exercise I was allowed to do for my thighs was isometric (sit on a chair with the legs bent at a 90-degree angle, cross the legs at the ankles, and have the front leg push backwards while the back leg pushes forwards) and I can honestly say it is as challenging as hoping on a leg extension AND hamstring curl machine (since the front leg tries to perform a curl and the back leg an extension). So instead of looking for jugs, books, or weighted backpacks, try isometric lateral raises, bicep curls (which become triceps extensions on the way down), etc. - just keep the tension going and see how long it takes you to break a sweat.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After hearing so many good things, I bought this trilogy as my first Kindle purchase and I'm glad I did. I do not want to give any of the story away, all I can say is WOW. Get them, read them, and do it asap. This is a must have trilogy. I will read these books time and time again.<br />I have not stopped thinking about the story or characters since I started reading the first book. I read all three books back to back in a few days and by the end of it all I was in tears.<br />Suzanne Collins has done a wonderful job of making you feel emotionally invested in the story and characters. This series is one of the best I have ever read. I am a very avid and picky reader, so this is saying a lot.
B004YXE438|5.0|love playing this game. great Bc no wifi connection is needed. great for all ages Bc there are different. levels.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|I have to say this Album is one amazing compilation of remixes! I love every one of the remixes although I can't say the tracks are any better i can say most of them are just as good in there own way! Both the original album and this album prove that Daft Punk still has it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys thrillers. Collins did an excellent job once again!  Couldn't put it down!!<br />  Mike M
B006UKFFE0|4.0|I received an early draft of Running Lean in 2011 and it was the first book on CustDev/Lean that I read. The book is written in a style that is super easy to follow and very difficult to put down! What I love most is how it that it is prescriptive and actionable; it gives enough detail to get started immediately and be confident that you're on the right track.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Best thing about this app: your notes are available EVERYWHERE!  Mine are synchronized across my ho<br />me PC, android phone, Kindle Fire, work PC, etc.  Also easy to organize notes, and webclipper is awesome!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This is a wonderfull movie of the actual play live in the Royal Albert Hall. As a big fan of the Phantom of the Opera, which I saw live twice, many years ago. It was a great way to reqindel great memories. It was like being thier all over again. The movie was wonderfully shot and the lighting is great. Could not ask for more, you will not be disapointed.
B0000AMJED|4.0|The movie was in good condition. My problem was that I needed the item by a certain day and nowhere did it say this was an OUT OF THE COUNTRY SELLER! I think that needs to be posted somewhere so that you know before you buy your product. I contacted them and they had slow contact time so of course it was already sent out and too late.
B002RT69QQ|4.0|There's really no reason not to buy this product. It's very useful and inexpensive. The only thing I don't really like is the the cover is a bit flimsy, but that's only material if you really want to keep it on your key chain. I keep it in my camera case to transfer files whenever I need to - very convenient.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's fun enough. the real value, as I'm sure the designers are aware, is in the quantity of games, not the quality of any particular game.

1594481717|3.0|I just finished reading Daniel H. Pink's book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us. The point of the book may be summed up by Pink's tweet: \\"Carrots & sticks are so last century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery & purpose.\\" (p 203). Drive is an easy read, thoughtful and quite engaging. Pink is fascinated by the processes, cultures, and people that power successful leading-edge organizations' work in the 21st century, especially those in technology corridors. In Drive, he has done a fine job of researching these organizations and telling a compelling story about why they have so spectacularly changed the way we do business - and our world.

B006SV2LWA|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was intense and portrayed the science in a highly accurate way.  I recommended it to the other biologists that I work with.  Kate Winslet's character was particularly sympathetic, and I loved how women in science were portrayed.
0545101425|4.0|While it was not the best in the series,  it was still a pleasure to read.  I dont think any true fan would not enjoy this book if they have enjoyed the others.  I cant wait for the movie to come out.

0345472322|2.0|In Mindset: The New Psychology of Success published by Random House, Inc. the author, psychologist Carol Dweck advocates that human beings must shed themselves of a \\"fixed mindset\\" and acquire a \\"growth mindset\\" in order to attain personal growth and progress. I am not a fan of motivational books; however Dweck makes sense; adults, especially those in charge of children ought to take her core ideas to heart. The book's premise may be summed up in Dweck's own words thus:     \\"When we teach people the growth mindset, with its focus on development, these ideas about challenge and effort follow. Similarly, it's not just that some people happen to dislike challenge and effort. When we (temporarily) put people in a fixed mindset, with its focus on permanent traits, they quickly fear challenge and devalue effort.\\"    Read the rest of my review on my blog at:    [...]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this was a great story. I think it is a scary thought of what these characters had to go through. It makes you really think about what our world could come to.
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|Acting: A<br />Story: A+<br />HD Picture: A+<br />Digital Copy: F<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie that looks great in 1080p. My only complaint is the garbage version of digital copy known as ultraviolet. UV only allows you to stream the movie rather than download to iTunes. The whole point of a digital copy is to travel with the movie in a portable fashion. Internet can be hit or miss while traveling, so why would I want to only be able to stream the movie on my iPad and iPhone? The bluray is exceptional. You can love or hate baseball and you will enjoy this movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this game, i have to hide my pnone from everyone in my family because they fight over who gets to play it. i have never had any problems with it and it works great on my xoom and my droid 4

B006UKFFE0|5.0|When I tore through Running Lean I kept thinking (warning: 40 something TV reference inbound) of the TV show Name That Tune.  Yes, the book has plenty of the pre-requisites for something you tear through - well written in a direct and approachable voice, moves along at a good clip, plenty of pointed observations and examples to bring them to life, etc.  But what I found most powerful was that in his delivery of the book, Ash is eating his own Lean dog food not just on content but on how he delivers that content.  The result?  A how-to that definitely punches above its weight.<br /><br />First, he shares the Lean-inspired principles at work in his business ventures, using the book as sort of an open bridge hand for us to watch as he plays.  Table stakes for this kind of a tome yes, but done well.  As important though, he's been able to convey these interesting Lean principles in a simpler, more graspable, practical and flexible way than I've encountered elsewhere.  With the result being a really short walk between the ideas in his book and real word applications to the new venture I've been working on.  And that's when you know you have a good resource for helping you actually do something differently...you're engaged by the thinking on the first run through, and returning often to try out bits and pieces on the real world questions you're wrestling around with... rather than just liking the ideas but feeling overwhelmed by the effort or rigidity of applying them to your situation.  Definitely plenty of virtual thumb grease on this one from heavy use and more to come.  And definitely helping me call the tune on plenty of decisions in the fewest notes possible.
1594203334|5.0|This is a modern lit book that reads with such finesse, you might be surprised to find it to be a parenting book. Which is a good thing. As an American mother of a 4 month old, I could put into practice some of the pieces of wisdom she acquires that sound interesting to me, and I will tell you- it works without a hitch. They are simple things that apply to most to all children. Unlike most parenting books which seem to only work for the author. But I guess when you got an entire country believing and adhering to the same principals, then it is pretty universal stuff. I highly recommend it.
B006C67NP6|5.0|This like having The Real Book and trio in your gigbag. Plus you can add your own scores, share them with bandmates, and use the integrated player with track mixer to tweak the accompaniment. The beats are more jazz centric, but I'm hoping they will add some more rock, pop, folk and world beats, as well as a few more dance beats. But it is insanely good already.
B002QNEJT2|5.0|Dexter is like an oyster: you either love it, or hate it, very little in-between, as far as how people view it.  I am a fan, a cautious fan.  The show is intelligent, witty, off the beaten path and a whole lot of fun. But, there are just enough whacko's out there who might want to emmulate his hero-like qualities and start hacking people up, and actually there have been a handful of cases where the wanna be serial killer confessed to wanting to be like Dexter.<br /><br />All that said, the show is amazing, great casting, wonderful acting, and I hope the main characters and producers want to keep it going for a long while.
B004XNPQUO|1.0|Game gets boring fast. Needs more challange hardly an arcade type game. If this game had been around back on the day, kids would have saved plenty of quarters.
B004XNPQUO|1.0|does not work on the milestone. goes to a black screen and that's all it does. uninstalling from my phone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I always play this game. I loveit. the creater of this game should get a huge award for it cause this game is AMAZING! !!!! so don't be afraid and get this game!!!!!!
B006H0627C|5.0|This is an entertaining show, have not missed one episode, thanks to Amazon. Some of the scenes are a bit graphic, since they are dealing with the dead, but those scenes usually fit well, and are brief enough.  Love the actors, Emily is amazing as the quintessential NT personality (Meyers-Briggs personality inventory), and David, her perfect sidekick.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loved it! The quality of the sound and picture is beautiful. I highly recommend it.
0062011847|3.0|Terry Pratchett's Snuff is a solid entry in the Discworld series, but not his funniest. I loved that the book paralleled the issues of slavery and the treatment of goblins. And of course, who doesn't enjoy a good Commander Vimes solved murder, but I felt that the last four chapters could have been cut without the plot suffering. However, I enjoyed learning more about goblin culture and all the fascinating poo references were very entertaining. If you love Discworld, then you will like this book, but don't make it your first introduction into the series. It will be disappointing, otherwise.
B004XNPQUO|3.0|I think it is okay because some stuff is hard playing but it is good games for kids like for5-9
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I have never read a book where the protagonist was a witch and I wasn't overly sure whether I would like it or not. Obviously I really enjoyed the book. I couldn't seem to put it down!<br /><br />I really liked Sophia's character. At the beginning of the book you see how much crap she puts up with in her day to day life. She is pretty much the outcast of the town and as a result doesn't have many friends. But when one of her friends takes her to a club, Sophia has no idea that she is walking into a club for supernaturals which is where she meets Charles. Even though Sophia is sort of a meek character, she does have a backbone and when push comes to shove she will do anything to save those whom she cares about. She was easy to relate to because she was the perfect mix of between the bad-ass and shy heroines that you see now a days in novels.<br /><br />I liked the back story about Sophia's ancestors and even the romance between Charles and Sophia. However, it was a little hard to wrap my head around the fact that there was so much sexual tension between them for no reason... after like 6 months of dating. I get that Sohpia was worried about their relationship not lasting but then what is the point in dating? You're still putting yourself through emotional distress in the end anyways. Aside from that though, the story had a smooth pacing to it and transitioned well between the different scenes.
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|i really enjoy this movie....it has a really good story line worth 4 bucks if u got time check it out....
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I don't know how I feel about the way Glee has become...it has its ups and downs. However, I truly liked the first season of Glee, so much that I even kept dreaming about the characters around the time I was watching it!<br /><br />What I liked about the first season better than any other season of Glee was the sense of direction in the plot. It starts with kids that don't fit in too well in high school, and want to find their voice (literally) by joining a choir, opened by an alum (Mr. Shue) who also shined in his Glee Club. More people slowly start to join the club, while Coach Sylvester drives to do anything in her power to cause their demise. Add to that Mr. Shue's marriage on the rocks, a football team with no edge, and other surprises coming in and out, and you get a pretty great story, appropriate for high school ages and up. Oh, and I think the antagonists in these episodes are underrated.<br /><br />One thing that I did think was a bit over the top was Quinn's pregnancy. I liked that something controversial like that was put into the mix, but in some episodes, her pregnancy did not seem very believable. Her final decision with the baby, and the parties involved, seemed too rushed considering it was such a huge decision. And come Season 2, it seemed as if she never went through a crisis like teen pregnancy!<br /><br />Still, that didn't detract from the season as a whole. The extras in the DVD were ok, but could be better. They were mostly songs, deleted scenes, and a look through the characters' wardrobes. I was really hoping to hear some commentary from the directors or main actors, but sadly I did not see that.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Well I'm not too impressed once again and I am not surprised either. Once again but even more, Drake is back on the emotional wave, discussing about his problems, which are barely problems. The production is calm for the most part, with variation and progression. The beats are definitely not static but the constant pads are rather boring and repetitive. Drake performs solidly on the album, displaying his rapping and singing abilities. I find the singing parts rather annoying but it adds a different feel and atmosphere. The album has a nice feel and the content is relevant, not just a bunch of nonsense. Just not a fan of heavily complaining about simple things. A good listen, I just not on that wavelength.<br /><br />[...]

B004LWZW8I|3.0|\\"Stand your ground! Fight for order! Fight for the man beside you!  Fight for your children! Fight for your future! Fight! For immortality!\\" When King Hyperion's (Rourke) quest to find the ultimate weapon threatens to destroy both man and gods the gods look for a warrior to lead the charge against the King. The gods pick a young villager named Theseus (Cavill) who soon becomes the true leader they were hoping for.  I have never really been a big fan of the huge epics like this one. I have liked \\"The Eagle\\" but not \\"Clash Of The Titans\\" or \\"Conan\\". I say that so those of you that loved those movies can stop reading this now.  To me the best part about it was the way that it looked. It may have helped that it was the blu-ray but visualy it looked great. The battle scenes were good and all but the movie to me was hard to stay interested in. Again though with all that said if you like this type of genre then this is a must-see.  Overall, a great movie for fans of the genre. I give it a B.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|Love this movie. Very engaging. Not a single dull moment. Should have been shown widely in America and each actors in this movie should have been nominated because each one is at the top of their game.
1936850028|4.0|This is the Birkie book I've been waiting for.  Intimate, funny, and chock full of wisdom, Rhein's account gives us an insider's perspective on North America's longest ski race.  Whether I was learning about the author's childhood relationship with the famed trail, skiing the race, or training alongside the global community of athletes the Birkie had brought him into contact with, I was drawn into the author's personal and profound relationship with one of my favorite silent sports.  A must who for anyone who has taken the race beyond the realm of sport.

B007G5FX4K|5.0|The lady really knows how to make you want to dance.<br /><br />I can see this being played in every club and even in strip joints!<br /><br />Madonna always seems to make songs that you want to hear over and over again, and this one is no different.  It connects with<br />some inner part of you that only she consistently is able to touch.  It's a genre, [MOODY DANCE MUSIC], that she is the master of, think \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" from Erotica, \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Sorry\\" from Confessions On A Dance Floor, and many others.<br /><br />This is the reason she and she alone is QUEEN.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game has great graphics.  it never hers old because there are always new goals that you have beat. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. I love the narrator's voice, he makes the underdtanding of the Bible clear, because he reads it as s story and not sd if your're just reciting verses. 1 draw back, I have s kindle fire and unless. you have wi-fi I can't use it anywhere else, my smart phone is the only way. I would love to use this app ar church.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using the app on my Toshiba Thrive for a couple months and have been very pleased.  The first setting I changed was the low light setting (to invert text and background color) since the default was a litle difficult to read.  The book mark function is handy.  I have not used the 'live' part much but briefly checked it out to se what was going on near my zip code.  My first thought was how I need to get my home church's info on the site!  Anyway, great app for basic Bible reading.  I usually have an online cross reference going at the same time just to get additional info.  App is well written, easy to use, very responsive, and free!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|very very very very very very very very awesome and great game but not recommended for little kids it has cuss words

B006SV2LWA|4.0|This scenario is scary because I could sees it happening. I could see people (stupidly) rioting over food and stuff like that. I like the modern aspects of this movie; it's really up with the times and with digital technology. I think there is a very real and human aspect to this movie. Every character acted on what they knew best and acted on their survival instincts.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love that I can share with my friend and I like that I can restart if I want and it's like a mini 3D virtual world.

B004T6IBNY|5.0|I love pinball, and this is an exceptionally good pinball game, second only to the old Sierra 3-D pinball games that didn't play well on newer PC's, with much more realistic pinball tables.  As to the negatives some reviewers have mentioned:<br /><br />1. When I first got this the touch was a little off, but since a January Kindle Fire update it has been fine.<br />2. Somebody mentioned advertisements on the screen after the game. Perhaps that person has the free version, as mine doesn't have advertisements.<br />3. As for glitches; it froze once on a black screen which I fixed by removing and reloading the game from/to the Kindle. The display started again without my top scores.  They may be somewhere in the cloud, but it's not a big thing to me. One glitch in at least 60 hours of play doesn't seem unreasonable.<br /><br />At $2.99 this  five-game app is a steal.  I fell in love with the Wild West table and played it hundreds of times until accidentally clicking on the Brix game which hadn't looked interesting but turned out to be extraordinary.  It combines pinball with another arcade game where you knock down bricks, and has multiple levels. A new table at each level, extra colored \\"bonus\\" balls and lots of multiball action make this an exciting game.  There are also the three tables that are available on the free game, which I haven't tried.<br /><br />The games look stunning on the Kindle Fire, which is a perfectly-sized platform for playing. If you love pinball this is a must-buy.

0525478817|5.0|As there are nearly 500 other reviews of the book as a whole, I would like to limit my comments only to Augustus Waters.  I am a former high school English teacher now in my 60s.  I have read many many fine works and have known many many fine characters.  Augustus ranks among the most memorable.  I won't forget him soon, and I hope not ever.  He, though, would realize that even the fondest memories will fade.  Augustus  is among the most noble, generous, loving, and kind characters I have known in books.  Perhaps it is partially his abiding and engrained sense of self-sacrifice that make me love him.  I think of Augustus, and I think of Sidney Carton (A Tale of Two Cities) who has long been my favorite literary male character, with Once and Future King's King Arthur, and Sometimes a Great Notion's Hank Stamper.  The three have this in common--their sense of giving to others.  Of course there are many other endearing and beautiful qualities to this boy--one cannot forget his genius sense of humor, and again, his great kindness and loyalty.  I no longer read 'young-adult' novels, and I have never before read a \\"cancer-kid\\" novel, so I cannot compare the book in its entirety to others of the genre.  But I can compare Augustus, and he shines.  This book moves me deeply, and yes, I did drop some tears and get the lump in my throat, and I still do, as I think of this boy.  I'm glad I read this book , and I am glad to know Augustus Waters.  My heart is a bit more of a beautiful place because of him.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|Woody Allen reminds us of what a movie should be.<br /><br />First of all, get it done in an hour and half. It is so utterly pedantic (to steal a word from this movie) of a director to steal two and half hours to make their point. When did this trend start, the Titanic? I enjoyed \\"The Help\\", but come on, it took too long.<br /><br />This is a wonderful fantasy that dares you to suspend disbelief, because even the protagonist Gill cannot believe it. Yet he is forced to accept it, because there it is, up on the screen so to speak. We have no choice either. How much bolder a device can you think of than that? I don't want to go into detail about why you will enjoy this romantic comedy, I just want to tip my hat to Woody Allen for his old school craftsmanship. I just hope other movie makers will take note and hone their message to reasonable span.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the first book I have read by Suzanne Collins and it wasn't the last. This book kept me reading to the very end.(To be perfectly honest I wanted Rue to win the minute I meet her.)
0743289692|5.0|What a book, what a lady, what a life full of lonliness, challenges and courage.  We could all learn a lot from this inspirational journey.  Her enormous strength and determination, her sacrifices and courage, her fight for justice and her self belief is a pure inspiration to all.  Wouldn't it be just wonderful to welcome her to Australia with open arms so she could make a life for herself amongst one of the most culturally diverse nations in the world.  Please read this book and encourage everybody you know to read it too.  It's a perfect example of what one person can do to change ignorance and discrimination.  Brilliant.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book wasn't the best but it still was worth reading. The only thing I wish was changed was that Finnick wasn't killed off. And if he had to be killed off I wish he died more graciously.
1401307787|5.0|This was required reading in my fifth year of a doctoral level psychology program in a class relating to spirituality in psychotherapy.  By the time I completed it, I wished I had it as a resource from day one.  It provides essential skills for managing any and all levels of stress.  This is a great introductory book for people seeking to find a better way of living.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was by far the best book I have ever read.To start with the Quater Quell change to the Hunger Games caught me completely of guard. Then the arena being designed as a clock was awesome. Over all the book deserved more then just 5 stars.
B000002KGT|4.0|If you ever wanted to know what heartache sounds like, take a listen to this album. In case you haven't heard (chuckle, chuckle) this album mixes all the love shenannigans and toiling emotions within the band. It will take you on a gripping ride!<br /><br />I myself avoid the radio staples like \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"You Make Lovin' Fun.\\" They sound great live (saw them on tour for Unleashed 2009) but in order to still enjoy all the music without being saturated, I let the radio do the work. \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" are my favorites and they as well sound amazing when played live.<br /><br />Ladies first: as a huge Stevie Nicks fan, I can never get sick of her tracks. To this day I cannot believe why \\"Silver Springs\\" became a B-side to \\"Go Your Own Way.\\" I understand there needed to be enough room for all the songwriters but the decision to cut that track was a silly one! If that happened to me, I would've secretly made the \\"Bella Donna\\" album too! My favorite track from Christie McVie was \\"Songbird.\\" This song is McVie at her best. It's honest, beautiful, eery and tear-jerking. Known for her love lullabies on the 1975 Fleetwood Mac album, \\"Songbird\\" rocks you to sleep while tearing you apart.<br /><br />Lindsey...Lindsey...Lindsey...he is present throughout this album. From his musical contributions to his masterful engineering, he is everywhere (no pun intended.) Besides the hits off the album, I have to say \\"Never Going Back Again\\" really sums up the emotional mess between him and Stevie that to this day we are still talking about!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|this is really the follow-up to 1980's 'Drama', when Geoff Downes (keys) and Trevor Horn (voc)made that great album after being absorbed from the Buggles (Video Killed The Radio Star). Benoit  sounds just LIKE Horn on this cd, without exception. i should add that Horn produced this album, along with the biggest albums of Yes ever (90125, Big Generator etc) sorry to Benoit David go due to illness, but i hope we get more of this fantastic music!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was captivating and interesting every page. The pictures are an excellent touch! The ending left me wanting more which, to me, makes a great ending, but is a little disappointing at the same time.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|I thought this would be tedious with the subtitles, but really I got very wrapped up in the show. It like science fiction and fantasy type movies. I liked Cloverfield and I think this feels along the same order although it felt much more real than Cloverfield. I do really like the Troll Hunter, Hans. I thought the trolls were pretty well done as well. This was more like watching one of those reality shows or something about Yellowstone bears or something. I think the acting was pretty well done for a mockumentary.
0689862725|5.0|This book called The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is a based on his full length novel of the same name. It is a pop-up book produced for a younger audience, which is a great way to introduce them to the world of Stephen King. This book is a first edition, in good condition, and has all pop-ups working and in very good condition. Was sent very well packaged.
B00005B5L4|5.0|Last night I listened to the DVD-A for the first time, and was SUPER<br />pleased! I also have the newly released SACD from Warner Japan, but I just<br />wasn't that impressed by it (probably because I can't hear pure DSD). The<br />DVD-A sounds so life-like, it's almost scary. The separation of instruments<br />and the clarity is just outstanding. After a long hunt to get this now OOP<br />disc, I am very content!
B003ZSISGM|5.0|This book is the middle one of his three books - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is his first book.  His books are excellent, well written and spine tingling.  I found this book a bit difficult to get into but once there you can't put it down.
0393338959|3.0|I am glad I got this book. It serves as a strong and apparently accurate critique of the financial system, especially the resulting housing debacle. I am more conversant with the conservative analysis of economic affairs, so it is good to expose oneself to a different view point.  And different it is. According to Stiglitz the housing problem is merely the tip of the iceberg. Basically he supports the entire left wing agenda and as far as I can tell does not deviates from it by one jot or iota. (Amazingly, some reviewers think he is too conservative.)<br /><br />The author accurately points out numerous instances of inherent dishonesty in the banking and financial sector which seem outrageous. But he also makes several questionable assertions he might have better left out. In one section he criticizes Greenspan and others for focusing on inflation. After all, he states everyone has inflation protection written into their union or government contract or is on social security. The country of Ghana had bad inflation and they dealt with it without too much pain. Yet he does not address the effects of inflation on the unprotected assets of the private sector, especially for the retired. The privately funded retired don't deserve to have their savings wiped out and we are not Ghana.<br /><br />In another section he criticizes the Eisenhower interstate highway program, but isn't this just the type of jobs and infrastructure program that government should do well.  Sure the program had vast unintended consequences, but would not any well intentioned government program do the same? Yet he unreservedly supports all the left's programs and believes the world would be set right. What would be the unintended consequences of vast new government programs? What type of opportunistic parasites would have to be dealt with? How many people would be fined or jailed to assure compliance. Would partisan politics be replaced by true democracy?<br /><br />The left's agenda is based on the idea that the world is going to hell because of the greed and power of unfettered capitalism. If Stiglitz had stuck to the subject at hand, I think he would have been more convincing.  His solutions, never well spelled out, are more government programs, not just to regulate the financial sector, but everything.<br /><br />We must regulate away consumerism, predatory lending, global warming, social isolation, financial inequality and world poverty.Either this or we must just voluntarily change our attitudes. Somehow, doing this would improve and stabilize the economy.  I am unable to understand the economics he advocates.  All I know is that it would entail a gigantic regulatory bureaucracy.<br /><br /> But we already have that. We also had financial regulations going into this crisis, which were not being properly implemented.  Those who call for more government always do so in the same breath in which they complain about the way special interests corrupt the government we have. In fact we already live in an era of vast government powers. Would not any new laws bring in a new wave of special interests?<br /><br /> One would  have to be a hermit not to have noticed I how many new areas government has gotten into. Thousands of new federal crimes have been invented, for doing everything from possessing an eagle feather to not having a disabled parking place.  These things do not come cheaply. I am in health care and I know firsthand the costs of complying with such mandates as CLIA, HIPPA, OSHA an OCCA regulations. Now we have Obama Care.  Maybe if we regulate our way to a social paradise, economists are right, numerous jobs will be created complying with the explosive increase in regulations. And if they believe this will increase the quality of life, I hope they will forgive those who have some doubt.idea that the world is going to hell because of the greed and power of unfettered capitalism.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best its diffedinly 5 star i am always playing on it i deleted it on accident. but then reloaded it:D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter recommended this book and the other 2 in the trilogy.  I wasn't too sure but I am so glad that I listened to her.  I thoroughly loved the writing style and the story of hope and tenacity.  Now I wish there were more books from Collins like these!  Just so you know--I am a retired teacher of 35 years and a grandmother so these books are appropriate for all types and ages of readers!  Enjoy!
B006ZEDZNY|2.0|Do not pay for this.... Movie is a BIG waste of my time and money!!!<br /><br />Very little plot, the story had no flow....
B004Y1USV2|5.0|A good sign for me is that I immediately had to replay the CD to listen again...original and unpredictable at times, cohesive presentation, sounds like NEW YES with OLD YES...beautiful album, nice addition with bonus DVD!  It's a masterpiece, I love it!
B002LAM7PI|5.0|My daughter had no issues with the movie, but my son who was then about 9, covered his eyes several times and was scared by the movie. Several years later, they watch the movie again and they both really enjoyed it. The first time I watched it, I thought \\"What the...\\", but somewhere midway into the movie, I got the point and found the film fascinating. It is entertaining, funny and, yes scary - intensely so. The idea behind the movie is to not expect the world to revolve around yourself and not just to be content with what you have, but to really appreciate what you have...your life, family, neighbors, possessions, etc.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is simple and fun, I love it. So if you like or live fun games, this is most definatley the game for you.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I absolutely love Led Zeppelin best band to walk the earth IMO. So needless to say it was a complete thrill to see Jimmy on the big screen. Like someone else had mentioned when we went to the theatre to see it, when it was over no one wanted to get up it was so riveting. It is a fantastic documentary but having Jimmy in it made it all that much better. He is so elegant & humble even though he is a guitar genius!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This app is fantastic, ever since the update, it's got even more cool blades to choose from! However all of my previous achievements were erased. So be wary about that. The only real problem I with it is the shadow blade. In this version, you gotta get 234(no more no less), in Arcade Mode(this counts achievements too) instead of plying upside down.
076790592X|4.0|Since my Father died in 2008, I have been reading books and articles about relationships between men and the people in their lives.  Lately, I have noticed a growing trend where men are sharing their emotions. The macho rock is gradually getting a few rough edges knocked off.<br /><br />\\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was recommended by a co-worker. The book was a bitter sweet read. Morrie's history seemed to be a story of a true man with transparent emotions. He marched to a different drummer. He was not afraid to be different, and seemed to enjoy swimming against the current. Even he had some memories that were not good and at least one regret.<br /><br />May we all live a life that longs to connect to those around us. May we all turn off  the distractions and spend quality time with family and friends. Forget the bad memories. Forgive those who have hurt us. Dance when ever there is an opportunity.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this game, it is very fun and addicting. my only downside is that when customer's buy food, you only get one token, otherwise it is fun for all ages and genders.
1573301183|5.0|As a fellow fan of AIC, I treasure this honest and humble acoustic concert among Facelift and Dirt. It's one thing listening to that cringing voice of Layne's, but to watch them in action, it nearly made me cry. He looked awful, and it's a shame that such a talented soul had to die, especially in the manner that he did. This concert, however, is worth every penny that you have to pay. This is a must-watch for any true fan of grunge/metal/hard rock and they still make a statement on soft acoustic. Jerry Cantrell and Layne Staley's harmonies are great, and the atmosphere is so approachable and laid-back, as Layne sits on a stool and takes a whiff of a cigarette. Watch it and prepare to be moved.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|The game is great. You'll be playing forever. I have been playing in till one in the morning. GET IT!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it it rocks great for kids lots of games fun 101 games come on where else can you find that many games in one game
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a very good game, I find it very addictive. I like that you get to win once and awhile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it. You'll really never forget you read this book. Book is not  a significant word to describe it. Honestly, I'm 12 and i never have read a book twice except for this one. Yeah its that great. Its about a 16 year old girl(katniss)  who volunteered for her 12 year old sister(primrose) in the reaping for the hungergames. The rest I'll let you read yourself.
0812974786|5.0|I tried reading a different translation of this book about three years ago, and I just could not get into it the way I did with this one. Admittedly, that could be because it was three years ago and I have certainly changed during that time, but I definitely think that the translation was at least part of it. This particular translation is gorgeous, and I have fallen in love with the book itself as a result. It is a fantastic story that has been so beautifully translated that I want to learn German so I can read the original. I read it twice in the first week I had it, and it has since become the book I carry around with me and start reading whenever I have some extra time and need something to do. I have been able to find so much wisdom, meaning, and significance in this book. Indeed, I am not usually the type of person to read the stuff that comes before the book actually starts (introduction, forward, translator's note, etc.), but I did that with this and found even that fascinating. In short, I would highly recommend this book, and this translation, to anyone wishing to be treated to a lovely, peaceful story told with elegance and simplicity.
032147404X|5.0|I read reviews on this book warning about bad jokes , I found they help you get in the mind set of how the book was written. After the cheesy intro the book gets to the point in a simple understandable way. I have a canon rebel and wanted to get better shots. I watched a dvd on how to use the camera, but the tips in this book , I feel brought me up to the speed I was looking to be at.[[ASIN:032147404X The Digital Photography Book]]
B000UDJS2S|3.0|Ok film about a 17 year old guy who sells his soul to the devil. Then he tries to make the best out of a bad situation by only killing bad guys. It is what it is..ok.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can play this for hours n hours.. I really enjoy this game! I can never get tired of it, I highly recommend it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was pretty good so was the games it was really fun I would rate a hundred if I could!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|i had high hopes for this movie and after the first but it is a let down. DO NOT BUY!
B003K16P3M|5.0|The first book of the Graceling series, kept me so entralled, in the fantasy, that I couldn't wait to get to the second book.  It is a fast read, for it is hard to put down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one draw back is that the games are very simple.  however, this is definitely a good app for killing time.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|It is an interesting take on the original Tron: Legacy Sound track. I still prefer the original though. If you like the classical instruments that are in the original sound track then do not buy this album.
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|I bought it but what I really want is Floyd's catalog in the highest fidelity possible.  So quit toying with us and release the catalog on HD Tracks at 96kHz/24bit, or better yet - 192kHz/24bit!
B004GUSG4M|1.0|I could not finish this.  The writing is unimaginative, slow paced and completely unengaging.  What a snooze and a waste of money.
B005UBNKZG|1.0|I bought this processor about 4.5 months ago.  It was part of a mostly new build (except for HDs).  I have been building my own desktops for the last 10 years and never had any issues with an Intel build.  Thought I would try AMD mostly because of the cost difference.  From installation until it died last night, it ran fine, if always a little hot (excess of 40C even when idle).  At load, the stock HSF would really work hard.  Now, it just overheats within minutes of sitting at idle and shuts down the computer.  Unreliable in my opinion, will go with Intel for a replacement (along with a new MB).
B006ON41FC|4.0|I found the game amusing and enjoy playing it. I am likely to look for other games through END Games. I found it very easy to opt out of OpenFait.
B004XNPQUO|1.0|I've never had any app suck a battery to death so fast. fail. game was ok, nothing special. uninstalling now
B00006I8RI|4.0|I was a teenager when this came out and it was a good album to someone just immersing themselves in the metal scene. This album caused me to buy up everything else Ozzy had out to this point and I now own every edition of everything he has ever done, imports, singles, expanded, etc....I still pop it in and listen to Killer Of Giants, Shot in the Dark, and Thank God for the Bomb from time to time. No, not his best but if you take it in context of the Reagen era, the scare of nuclear war and so on it was very relevant to a fifteen year old fan. This was to me as Dylan was to my parents generation.
B003LVUFTQ|4.0|I was introduced to Nada Surf on the One Tree Hill album and decided to check out thier other stuff. I love this album, it didn't disappoint thats for sure. It is also one I don't mind my 10 yr old listening to.
B003K16P3M|3.0|This is a book that does not fit my standard preference, but the point where Po and Katsa meet really kicked the book into high gear.  The reason I am giving this book a 3 stars is because I really struggled at the beginning of this book - it took me 2 months to pick up, put down, pick up, put down - as I read the first 30% of the book.  But then I committed to it and the story took off for me - I finished it within days and loved the excitement it brought.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews, I see there is a second book.  I would definitely consider reading the second book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|such a cool app lots of fun works great for kindle fire and works fast also kids love it so much
B0041OT9W6|4.0|The Diary of Anne Frank was a great book. I was very interested in reading about this young girls life. She was a brave young girl.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|All 11 seasons of this hilarious classic for less than the price of 2 seasons of other shows? How awesome is that? You just can't go wrong! A great series from before the TV landscape was filled with one disposable \\"reality\\" show after another. One of the first continuously controversial network shows, Married... With Children broke more than a few rules and changed the face of sitcoms forever. Some say that's a good thing (me), while others say it has ruined wholesome TV programing (my mom). Whatever your stance you can't deny that Married... with Children was ground braking in it's heyday!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has a lot to offer.  I love how easy it is to navigate. nice and easy to use highlights
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this app.  It is one of my favorites, so hard to put down. I play the classic most of the time, try to do it as fast as I can.  Quest is really fun too.  I got it as a free app, couldn't ask for a better deal.  Thanks Amazon.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|This book takes way too much pleasure in killing people. I have no problems with the killing of terrorists, but to make it sound like some video game is beyond ridiculous.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|The album has been reviewed a few million times, if you are looking at this you are wondering if it's worth it for the money for this box set...<br />just based on the music I say YES YES YES!!!! The surround sound blu ray is AMAZING, effects are not overdone and all instruments clearly heard, I got lost in the music in a way I haven't since... well, a long time ago :)<br /><br />Some of the other stuff is strange and not so necessary, the marbles are kinda cool but... what will I ever do with them? The scarf is really cool, a bit thin but at least semi useful. The coasters are not very interesting and kinda cheap. The collector cards are mildly amusing for a couple minutes. I did like the card with the questions they asked to get the background talking bits.<br /><br />But again, the reason to get this is the MUSIC, it's awesome, it's amazing.<br /><br />Not sure how the vinyl reviews are getting on this page but ignore them and buy this set!
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Overall this was a very intriguing movie that held my attention to the screen despite the unusual story.<br />This is not a date movie or family movie, as it deals with some extreme subject matter and does contain a few graphic scenes.<br />The movie follows a young child, from the moment he is born in a fish market stall in Paris in the 1700s, through his life as he seeks to express his unique gift, an advanced sense of smell.  I won't give the whole story away but to say that his talents eventually bring him great opportunities, that become twisted because he simply lacks understanding of societal rules and moral code. He is an untrained hungry lion, set out in front of lambs. He cannot resist his temptations and was not taught to nor brought up with how to funnel his desires for expression using positive avenues.<br />It was a phenomenally interesting story, wonderful directing, great acting and set design. My only issue, was the ending sucked eggs. It was a horrible let down to such a tremendous journey and build up of the story.<br />I would buy this movie for my collection.
B0055SWM08|5.0|so happy I got this game :) such an amazing way to spend some free time! so worth the cheap price too
B004RJMUJO|4.0|there's a bug for the kindle fire, everytime you start it up the screen fit is wrong and the news tab is half shown
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I've been looking for a photo editor for my Kindle Fire and this one is amazing! There are solo many different effects, stickers, borders, etc. If you are looking for a simple, easy to use editing app for your photos, this is it!

006091307X|1.0|I was vaguely aware of the existence of Thomas Pynchon, and after hearing a brief summary of CoL49 I went to the library and grabbed this and 'V'. I got as far as page seventy before I hung it up and decided to take them both back. It's got that weird wacky 'everything ends up being connected' vibe of my favorite Vonnegut books, but without the humor or the sense that I cared about the characters or what happened next. I never really got a sense of character from anybody except Mucho Maas, and people seemed to behave in whatever manner would propel the chaos engine Pynchon was frantically trying to keep spinning with this book. The writing felt awkward and disjointed, sentences sometimes needing two or three readings to decipher. But it did keep making me think \\"I should read Slaughterhouse Five again\\".
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was surprised to find this free app. I use logmein with my netbook<br /> but they do not have anything yet for the Kindle Fire.<br /> This works really well after you get a little practice.
0756405890|4.0|There is a thick tapestry, richly embroidered with a wide array of colors. On that tapestry is woven an epic tale, a humble middle leading to a humble beginning and culminating in what I suspect will be a glorious finish. I don't know yet, because this sizable book is the first stretch, but there have been enough hints dropped that I have faith.<br />It's a fascinating mix of high fantasy, with sweeping vistas and kingdoms in the balance, and low fantasy, with dirt and trying to pay the rent.<br />(And for those who prefer to have their fantasy reviews related to Harry Potter, he's an orphan and goes to magic school.)<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next day.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|\\"Old Ideas\\" finds Leonard Cohen yet again reinventing himself and in turn rediscovering his roots in greyest parts of the blues. This aromatic truffle jar is rife with pungent and delightful aromatics that linger on long after the night has died out. Cohen has always been able to procure diamonds from the ashes of love and regret and \\"Old Ideas\\" brings for a handful of his best gems yet. Everything here just works. The blended vocals punctuating his ghostly remarks, the plaintive guitar, and even the soulful use of organ gives \\"Old Ideas\\" a fresh coat of musical paint. As the outdoor cover photograph suggests, Leonard Cohen seems to be embracing Spring in the Autumn of his years and we're all the better for it!<br /><br />[...]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|es un juego muy bueno. me gusta! I liked the game. it takes forever to unlock games, but it is fun..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game in the world game after game that I get it is just so awskme and so creative to have created this game. every game is so much fun
B000I8HIR2|5.0|This movie has exceptional picture and sound quality.  It is a perfect movie for a night that u want to get scared in the most grotesque way. Thank you amazon!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games for me and my three year old too! he loves unlocking new games and honestly so do I! great app
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have waited and waited for these guys to bury the hatchet and get back together for 27 yrs.<br />From the very first release of the single, \\"tattoo\\", i knew this was gonna be a great album and could hardly wait for its release.<br />There is no disappointment in this long awaited album, except for the fact that they have no scheduled tour stop here in the Land of Enchantment.<br /><br />I was texting a friend last week as she was at their show in Chicago, and she said it was an amazing show. A must see and for me... this album is a must have!!!!!
B0058VW36U|3.0|i think the game is fun and challenging but is not too puzzleing so you get to the end quickly ........still waiting for the &quot; more coming soon.&quot;:-)
B0016AJU2C|4.0|I've recently listened to two of Alanis' projects, this being the first and her greatest hits the second. I enjoyed them both for the most part, though one of the songs on this project (Straitjacket) and one of her greatest hits contain unnecessary words. (If that word would be bleeped, it's never necessary).<br /><br />Some of the negative reviews say it has a dance sound. Sorry, I didn't get that. This does have a heavier synthesized sound, but I did not consider it a dance beat -- just more of a heavy alternative style. It's different from what she started off with, but shouldn't we let artists explore? As long as they don't decide to leave the innovator role for an imitator (as Kansas did with their Drastic Measures project, where they started sounding like Loverboy).
1400069181|5.0|Let me start by saying this. It was not from lack of inspiration that it took me so long to finish this book. Anyone that knows me, knows I fly through books. But there are those, those books that especially challenge how I think and what I believe, that take me a little longer. These are the books that stay on my shelf. These are the books I re-read to suck every last bit of goodness out of. And this is one of those books.<br /><br />Every time I picked it up, I came away feeling inspired to impliment little changes in my life. To start thinking of creative ways to help people, making plans for my future, trying to find ways to incorporate the things I love (Africa) with the things that I'm good at (uh...giggling? this part is a little harder).<br /><br />You cannot read about Blake's journey, about the laughs AND the trials, without feeling something. Inspired yes. But I also found myself challenged. Challenged to look and see where giving was lacking in my life. It's a hard look. I'm still looking.<br /><br />The book is written almost like a business model. He goes through specific componant of his business, showing people the ways that he's succeded and even some of the mistakes he's made. I laughed. Outloud. A lot. Much to my embaressment in public places. Stories of Norstroms calling and offices based out of apartments.<br /><br />But there were heart wrenching stories as well. I still remember reading about the first shoe drop. I was sitting in bed with my mom, and I woke her up, cause I had to read her this one specific spot:<br /><br />\\"The kids, anticipating a new pair - or their first pair - of shoes were so eager for our arrival that they would start clapping with joy when they spotted the bus rolling into town. I broken down in tears many times. Oh my God, I thought, this is actually working.\\"<br /><br />It was this, this connection I felt to someone I didn't know, that caused me to keep reading. I thought of all the times in Africa I experienced the same joy. His vulnerability and total willingness to bare his soul for the purpose of inspiring people, is what kept me reading. The business advice was sound, and just about anyone can find something good in it, but this was my connection to the book.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I found out ...it works great on the droid,  but not on the kindle,  its difficult to use,  not user friendly
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What can I say, I did not immediately jump on the \\"Hunger Game\\" train when the books were released. A few friends encouraged me to read the series, but I honestly did not think I would enjoy them. Boy, was I wrong! This book completely took me by surprise. I could hardly put the book down and everything about it left me wanting more. So, it's no surprise that as soon as I was finished wit this book, I immediately moved on to the second in the series (which is just as good, I must say!).<br /><br />The book is basically about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who resides in District 12 within the nation of Panem. Each year, each district must select one male and one female (or tributes, if you will) to compete in the 'Hunger Games', where they will compete against the other competitors in each district and must survive until they are the last one standing. By a twisted turn of events, Katniss is elected the female tribute for District 12. This first book tells the story of Katniss's struggle to not only survive in the Hunger Games, but also keep her friends and family alive.<br /><br />My message to anyone that thinks this series isn't for them: give it a try. I think this series as a little bit of something for everyone - romance, action, adventure, and SO much more.<br /><br />Would DEFINITELY recommend!<br />:)
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Wall-e  was incredibly realistic looking with emphasis on the over polluted Earth. Brilliant with voice actors and sound effects. Had the moral message but wasn't preachy.  Good family movie, even for the adults.
B005LAIGSM|3.0|It's valentines day and my boyfriend and I decided to go to the movies. I had been dying to see 'The Vow' and after some convincing, my boyfriend had agreed to go. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a sucker for sweet, sappy, love stories. Typical favorites include the likes of \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"A Walk to Remember\\", just to name a few. So really, it was no surprise to anyone that I REALLY wanted to see this movie.<br /><br />The movie is basically centered around Paige and Leo, a young couple that seemed to fall in love almost immediately and got married shortly after. The couple is involved in a car accident, with Paige, of course, not wearing a seat belt and being ejected out of her seat and through the windshield. The movie tells the story of how the couple met and fell in love, Paige losing her memories of her husband, and how Leo struggles with the fact that the love of his life no longer remembers him and really doesn't seem to really want anything to do with him.<br /><br />I thought the movie was just OK. To me, this movie kind of fell short like the movie \\"Dear John\\". Who knows, maybe had they picked a different actor for Leo instead of Channing Tatum, I might of liked it a little better, but with the way it was and Channing taking over the role of Leo, it kind of fell flat. It's not something that I personally will be buying on DVD, but if it was to ever come out on Netflix, I might watch it again. If you're like me and in to the typical chick flicks, I'd say go see it and judge the movie for yourself. But as for me, like I said, it just wasn't for me.
B0051XQI84|4.0|Animated Kung Fu movie... Good for chuckles and family entertainment.  Adults can still enjoy the great animation and voice work.
0375703764|5.0|I loved this book.<br /><br />That said, it is not a good book for a lot of people, and I do not say that out of some smugness born of considering it a book most people are not capable of \\"getting\\" or otherwise over the general public's ability to comprehend.  I say that because the book suits a peculiar type of taste.<br /><br />Now it is a fairly challenging read, but then any book that tasks you to keep up with two stories being told at the same time, with some interjections from an unnamed \\"editor\\", and a host of appendices would be fairly challenging by itself even without the playing around with typography that also takes place within this book.<br /><br />Had I been asked to put a name to it, I'd say the genre of this book would be psychological horror, because to me it inspired that subtle (and more profound) creepiness like the more understated and better Twilight Zone episodes where something's  not wholly right, you know i'ts not right, but you can't quite put your finger on it.  I think this comes a lot from the layered symbolism...or more the appearance of symbolism because you find yourself wondering what it may be that you're missing and there's a sort of anxiety from that which mixes with the general vibe of the other two stories to pull you in further and let you feel at least what you think it may be like to go crazy...<br /><br />I know the previous is poorly written, but I honestly can't think of a more clear way to put it.<br /><br />If you're down with experimental books, challenging books, creepy books, or the like I believe this is definitely worth the effort and money.  If none of this sounds particularly interesting to you, don't bother.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|play this awesome game its has a ton of games but some of them are pretty bad but the majority of them are cool.
B0067LXQAW|3.0|I love The Cranberries. Immensly. Thought they were done forever. Last year I bumped into \\"New York.\\" Wow, blown away. When did they do this?!, I wondered. I play that song every day. When I heard new material was coming I was so excited. My favorite band for 10 years was back.<br />But I am sad. Dammit. Sad. I don't like Roses. Nothing grabs me. I don't tap my feet to the songs. Nothing edgy. I can barely make out Mike's guitar. The music is so soft and lush. I love D's voice, but this sounds exactly like her solo stuff.<br />The reviewer who wrote a book about this album saying how great it is, and breaking down all the previous Cranberries releases:  oh, please.  You liked the drumming, seriously?  Fergal is an amazing talent. But it's not heard here. The bass is the best ever? No it isn't.<br />I know you're not tapping your feet to this album either, reviewer.<br />It's sleepy, simple, and safe.<br />I am so sad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|my friend started to read this book i they said it was a really good book. so i started to read it and i loved it, this book is now one of my favorite books. i finished hunger games and now reading Catching fire (the second book to the series). i liked it because it was filled with some suspense and action and a little bit of romance. after you are done with hunger games click on the links to see the second book Catching Fire or the third book Mockingjay.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]

0060005696|2.0|Unfortunately, Barry Schwarz is a very smart man that isn't good with stating and backing up his ideas.  There is some interesting stuff in here but could be a lot more interesting if it was backed up with more studies and research and even surveys or things like that.  Most of the book is just the author talking about the subject and what he thinks about it and going on about it.  It makes for easy reading, but it lacks in depth.  The book could just as easily be 1/2 it's length and make itself just as useful but twice as efficient.  There are better choices out there (pardon the irony), though this book isn't a complete waste of time and as I said, at least it's easy to read.
0439023513|1.0|I'm really so sad and angry after reading Mockingjay. I feel as though the author smushed several chapters of important information into a couple of sentences towards the end.  There were tons of loose ties at the end and I'm left feeling so dissatisfied. The author could've put more of an effort in and gave the book the ending it deserved. I also feel like it was a sloppy job. The trial, the election, and Gail could've been more thorough. It was just choppy and poorly executed, like it wasn't finished.  I just don't understand. Not fair to the integrity of The Hunger Games...
B000O75F7C|5.0|The first track Fear Of A Blank Planet alone is worth buying this Release. For years I thought I might never discover any new bands that were as worthy of respect as many of the bands I grew up listening to....this band my friends is. If you are in your 50's ( or any other age ) and grew up liking bands like King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, Rush, Pink Floyd...by all means check these guys out. I got this one first and one at a time have discovered a band I can truely admire for it's ability to create songs that are just amazing to listen to for the diversity and creative newness that for me is a lifesaver! I don't know how someone can still be able to as artists do anything that has not been done before and be as refreshing as this stuff is...but it is and I'm am grateful beyond measure! For a while I was looking forward to maybe Gavin would do some studio work with King Crimson but it doesn't look like that will happen.If you are Familiar with RUSH  Alex Lifesons solo on \\" Anesthetize \\" is instantly recognizable and fits like a glove....get this and CRANK it!

B006LR0XLM|5.0|Tired of having take the SD card out of your phone to transfer files to your computer, and vice versa?  Tired of the cable hookup from your phone to your laptop?  Feel like putting a couple of gig worth of music on your phone but dread either the download process or the use of space it will need?  Along comes Dropbox to save the day....<br /><br />This app is simply INDISPENSIBLE as an up-in-the-cloud 2GB storage file that you can access from EVERY device you have... the phone, the tablet, the laptop, the desktop, any and all of them.  Every device you have can have access to it, should you wish.  Imagine having a folder on your laptop that holds 2GB worth of files (that doesn't even take up that space on the computer itself because of it being in the cloud), and then drag and drop anything into it... and then access it on ANOTHER device, without THAT device having to download any of it -- or even store it inside THAT device.<br /><br />It's just a perfectly heavenly app!  You can use it to drop your music files into, copy and paste music collections, all in one fell swoop on your laptop.... Then go to your phone and have ability to play them, just like any other file on your phone.  Or, certain documents you're working on that you need the ability to access from your tablet or phone.  Just drop them in a Dropbox folder, and they're accessible instantly!<br /><br />Referring friends apparently gets you more space than the already generous 2MB, but I have yet to take advantage of that.  But that sure is a neat way to increase the value of this app even further while helping friends and family learn about the benefits of this indispensible app.<br /><br />It's one of those apps that is definitely a MUST HAVE.  Truly, you'll wonder how you ever put up with downloading and file transferring on a daily basis between your devices once you experience THIS gem of an app!
1439192812|5.0|Richard Dawkin's books promote honesty - based on evidence derived from our senses or sensing instruments - microscopes, telescopes, radios (radio waves), etc.  \\"The Magic of Reality\\" & \\"I Never Thought I'd See The Day\\" (atheists were angry\\"), criticizing New Atheists, Richard Dawkins & Christopher Hitchens, were books both released on Oct. 4, 2011.  Today, \\"The Magic of Reality\\" has 802 Likes.  \\"I Never Thought I'd See The Day\\" has 30 Likes.  Proving, I think, that Scientific evidence-based thinking is gaining over Supernatural & mythical thinking.<br />The Magic of Reality truly is a wonderful book for older children, & for adults who would like to learn more about modern science.  A simpler science book for young children by Mr. Dawkins would also be wonderful. I think he could produce one more enthralling than \\"Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs\\" - but based on reality.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Don't waste your time on this worthless POS!  Darned near wrecked my Kindle Fire.  Locked it up and wouldn't even re-boot or shut off.  What little it did play was jerky and out of sync.  Good idea, but non--functional.
B001JJX7L0|5.0|My first CD recording by Michelangeli.  I am glad I bought this CD.  For some reason, his playing is just so magical to me.  The beauty of Chopin's piano music is fully manifested here.  The Mazurkas, the G minor Ballade and the Bb minor Scherzo etc. are all wonderfully played and recorded. The feel you get from listening to the 1st track - is heavenly.  A must have to add to your collection.
B006ON41FC|3.0|The game is ok.  could use more upgrades. But operation is smooth and functional.  Would not of paid money for it
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Funny. A bit of a guy movie. My son loved it. I like the dance scene the most because i am trying to encourage my 11 yr old son to dance. It implies that even a very weird nerd can be cool when he can dance. I like that message.
B007G5H2HQ|2.0|My wife and I did not like this movie, we found it not funny and slow.  We both fell asleep through certain points and I never do this.  Some people might like it but we did not.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and it so well written and I've given copies to almost everyone in the health care system.  To see this journey through her eyes it will change who you are and how you treat people. I think everyone will walk away from this book a better person. You'll also meet a mother we all aspire to be. If your a nurse this is a must read.

B003HTPHTK|5.0|Love and Other Disasters is bursting with eye-candy, ear-candy, and heart-candy. The cinematography is gorgeous, the music is wonderfully charming and the story is cute. Fans of well-written/acted/produced films take note: this is one such gem.<br /><br />The comedy works as well as the romance, and the characters poke fun at movie stereotypes as well as at themselves (the wacky smoker gal is hilarious) and the relationships are brightly played out in the 90 minute run-time. From start to finish I couldn't find anything wrong with this one!<br /><br />There are 3 central characters, each trying to find love, each with lessons to learn. The gay roomate's story is especially touching.<br /><br />In the film the characters watch \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and one states its her favorite film. That older film may be a classic, but I enjoyed this one much more.<br /><br />5/5 stars! Funny, romantic film.<br /><br />Blu-ray: 1080p video is great, colorful. DTS HD sound is fantastic. No special features, no subtitles.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have used this reader on my Droid 2 ever since I got it as a Free App of the Day.  I have preferred it to the built in PDF viewer and also over Documents To Go's viewer.  I have found that it did a nice job presenting the pages in a manner that would be usable on a smaller screen.  The text reflow was really nice here.<br /><br />I just recently got a Transformer tablet, and have been increasingly using it more and more on it. Although its the same app, the extra screen resolution really makes this app work really nice.  It almost feels like a totally different app, which means it does a good job at adjusting itself for different resolutions.<br /><br />To list a few of my favorite features:<br />- PDF annotations.  This is really nice feature.  I plan to use this a lot more now that I found it is available.<br />- Text reflow to allow better reading on smaller screens<br />- Night reading mode is great for reading without blinding yourself with a bright screen (I use this in the Kindle app too)<br />- Bookmarks<br />- Page thumbnails for navigating pages quickly<br />- Page turning animation gives it a nice visual quality.  (Although its not quite as nice as the Google readers where you actually control the page turning animation)<br />- The book library area showing recently used books looks nice.<br />- Document text to speech support<br />- Numerous configuration options allow customization of soon many things so you can adjust many little features to get it exactly the way you want it.<br /><br />As for things that could use improvement, I do find the annotation process to be a little odd at times.  Sometimes I can get an annotation list while other times I can't.  I also have found that annotating a doc that wasn't opened through this apps file browsing to be a risky thing.  I have had times were I would open a doc from another app and it would launch this. But I didn't notice that the file was a temporary file and any annotations I made to it would be lostwhen I closed the doc.  This isn't so much a problem caused by this app, but it is a process flow issue I have been annoyed with.<br /><br />In summary, I really like this app.  Although I was able to get it free I would actually have no reservations about paying for it.  It is truly worth it to me.
0486219577|5.0|I got this from the library but I may have to buy it. The illustrations are mainly flourished birds but the curves and ornaments can be studied and admired for hours. There are instructions and small examples of curves to copy, but I don't think I could replicate them. I just like looking at the beautiful examples. It's a lovely form of American penmanship that is mostly gone except for wedding invitations and diplomas.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I was incredibly non-plussed when I first heard about this movie, and had no intention to see it, ever.  Then my 17-year old son had to have an operation on his wrist, so he had to take a couple of days to recover.  One of the movies he wanted to see while he was down was this one, and as those of you with HS senior-aged sons may know, it's sometimes tough to get one-on-one time with them.  Anyway, my son, who had seen this movie before, wanted to share it with me, so I plopped myself down and expected your run-of-the-mill fight movie - yawn.  But this movie has a lot more to it than that.<br /><br />This film touches on a wide range of current issues and challenges - the war in Afghanistan, the downturn in the economy, the mortgage crisis, family crises, the impact of social media on our lives, etc.  And this is what makes this film more than a trite \\"underdog faces overwhelming opposition\\" story line.<br /><br />I won't give away any spoilers, but an aged Nick Nolte plays the role of a reformed alcoholic who missed the chance to have any sort of positive influence on his two sons.  One eventually joins the marines, and the other settles down and works as a HS physics teacher, though they both grew up boxing and then engaging in mixed martial arts, but that was in the past.<br /><br />The kinds of challenges faced by the characters in this film are believable, the story-telling is strong, and the acting is good.<br /><br />All in all, this is a strong movie, though not one you would want to choose for a date night, if you know what I mean.  This is a movie is testosterone-heavy, but still amazingly good.<br /><br />I am debating between 4 and 5 stars because the underdog story line is pretty heavily used, but I would be happy to see it again sometime, because I believe there is more there that I didn't catch the first time through - a hallmark of a good story.<br /><br />P.S. Probably my favorite character in the movie was the HS principal...if you watch you'll see why.  Cheers.<br /><br />I'm going to stretch a bit and go ahead and give this film 5 stars.why.  Cheers.<br /><br />I'm going to stretch a bit and go ahead and give this film 5 stars.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Well put together.  Nice music.  Good gameplay.  So far I have enjoyed it.  Haven't hit the hard levels yet.  Worth a buck.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|As much as I hate to say it, I actually liked this movie.  The movie does express some creativity, but maybe it's because it has so much nostalgia-factor for someone my age.  Nostalgia!?  Yeah, let me explain.  When I was a kid one of the hottest toys to come out was \\"Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.\\"  We never had one at our house, but a few lucky kids in the neighborhood had one and it was a real treat when you had a chance to play.  The popularity of that game has inspired its re-release [[ASIN:B00005BY8V Rock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTS Game].  Anyway, in this classic game two players face each other across a tiny ring, but they don't fight each other directly.  Each player has a set of controls which they use to try to \\"knock the block\\" off of their opponent.  The same thing happens in this movie, except the action is amped up about a billion times.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is cast nicely as a down and out, has-been fighter from the days when people actually boxed each other.  Then came the robots and he couldn't quite make that transition.  In the process he lost his career, his wife, and pretty much everything.  He does have his son though.  And his son is simultaneously fanatical about robot boxing and about fixing things.  The little guy finds an old sparring-bot and manages to fix it up and power it up.<br /><br />Jackman does just about everything he can to quash his son's desire to use this old beat up \\"bot\\" in the ring, but he won't be stopped.  From here on out we are looking at a story line that has been used over and over again where an unknown underdog comes out of nowhere to take on the world.<br /><br />The characters are entertaining, the premis of boxing bots is fun, and the special effects are amazing.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun ride.  Though I debated between a 3-star and a 4-star rating, I opted for 4 stars because I wouldn't mind seeing it again sometime (even though I expected going in that I'd like the film only well enough for a 1 or 2-star rating).ng).
B000V63CZI|5.0|I really enjoyed to get the digital version of this classic. It reminded me of my teenage days. I stronglly recommended.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Honestly, I am a bit surprised by all the negative reviews.  This cartoon is probably one of the most philosophically complex cartoons ever made.  My kids and I loved it.  The humor is sharp, and the themes are very deep.  If you are looking for a dumb \\"Sponge Bob\\" type of entertainment, this is not the movie for you.  If you are looking for a film that introduces complex and philosophical topics to your children every scene, this is a great film.  My daughter, 11, and I had great discussions that were driven by this film. We talked about topics like \\"what makes a good leader\\", \\"popularity\\", \\"loneliness\\", \\"love\\", \\"feeling lost\\", \\"being part of the whole\\", etc.  Yes, this cartoon is a bit too complex for most children.... but that is what parents are for.  Its beautifully drawn, with excellent music, and it just may introduce philosophy to your child.  Also, my 5 year old son loved it just for its entertaining scenes.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary is excellent.<br /><br />It exposes the reasons WHY 2008 happened, as well as the fact that our government in Washington STILL  has  NOT  fixed the problem which created it.  And the reason they haven't fixed it, is because members of our government profit immensely from leaving the laws the way they are, while the rest of our population gets to pay for the tragedy through our tax dollars.<br /><br />Pay particular note, how much Hank Paulson walks away with, free of taxes, courtesy of the Bush's, when he is brought on board with the feds in Washington, to supposedly help \\"fix\\" the  2008 problem.<br /><br />As pointed out in the documentary,  the European countries have passed laws against derivatives -  while our own government does nothing.<br /><br />Again, you see in the documentary, where European countries tried and convicted bankers/investment CEOs, who let this happen in their banks/investment houses;  they were held accountable  ---  yet our own government, did nothing - even with all the regulatory agencies that are in place.<br /><br />With regulatory agencies in the U.S. who do nothing but lower the unemployment rate - and clearly did nothing to prevent 2008 - we will surely see this same problem happen all over again, and again, and again.<br /><br />I think the \\"Occupy\\" movement needs to do a sit-in, in Washington, to get those laws passed.<br /><br />And, if Matt Damon were to sponsor a petition, at \\"change.org\\", which required that derivative trading be outlawed by our government in Washington  -  with his name on that petition, it would get millions of signatures, and Washington couldn't ignore ONE of the laws they put in place, which helped create the 2008 problem any longer.  They would have to change it.
0375842209|5.0|This wonderful not to be missed book is written and marketed for \\"young reader\\" as young as 12 years old by Australian author Markus Zusak. But it is most certainly an adult book in its unique style (its narrator being death itself) and subject (a young German girl's love of books who has to grow up in a small village just outside of Munich, and Dachau). The girl, Leslie Meminger is the book thief of the title.<br /><br />This is not primarily a holocaust story. It reminded me of two of my favorite books with similar settings. These books focus on how average Germans were caught up in the web of fear that was Nazi Germany. (Ursula Hegl's STONES FROM THE RIVER and Hans Fallada's EVERY MANN DIES ALONE.)<br /><br />No doubt Zusak's devise of introducing the reader early on to the story teller as death himself provides a most unique way of experiencing the story. Death introduces himself by saying, \\"Please trust me, I most definitely can be cheerful. I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that's only the A's. Just don't ask me to be nice. Nice is nothing to do with me.\\"  He then goes on to say, \\"I'm nothing if not fair.\\" and concludes with, \\"I am a result.\\"<br /><br />I really don't want to go into the story a great deal as the pleasure of the book is the discovery of each unique character.  I doubt it hurts for me to say the main plot point is that Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement. For some readers the discovery of good (or should I say average) Germans trampled by fear, repression and confusion while also empowered with the will to survive may run counter to German stereotypes.  After all it is Death himself who says, \\"I am haunted by humans.\\"<br /><br />I came to this book rather late. It appears that some 1,300 people have so far rated it on Amazon.com with 90% plus giving the book five stars (which I have done). In all these reviews there is not one person who gave it less than four stars. I doubt there are many books with this kind of readerresponse.  So it is rather easy to recommend the book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Never left a review before.  Was moved to do so by the outstanding quality of this book.  The story is epic, the characters well-drawn and memorable. The action and sweep of the story moves at a captivating pace that compelled me to keep reading for the three days it took to finish the book.  The range of characters are almost Dickensian in their ability to fascinate. I found the central character very well drawn and a real discovery, I am desperate to know how it turns out for him in future 'Blood Song' books.  Vaelin Al Sorna is surely a must for eventual transference to the big screen? I found the closing chapter very moving,  and very compelling in that I demand the next episode immediately Mr Ryan! Thank you, an excellent read.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome I love this game I love angry birds and I love Rio I'm just a kid we live our life's on this!!!!!
B006YJIIC8|5.0|I really enjoy this series and never miss a show since I became aware of it. I was so happy to find it on Amazon so that I could catch up on the episodes I had missed. It's like watching a Jane Austen movie every week. Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game cause it has games that u hag to play to unlock other game. U should download this app to have lots of fun!
B007BFZGAG|4.0|Tyga has chosen to surround himself with Star players on this album, and you'll be surprised to find that the biggest one, outside if Tyga, is producer Jess Jackson. His production stands out over the likes of heavy hitters Pharrell, Cool & Dre, Boi-1-da and  40. This album is a great listen, not necessarily for lyrics but all around enjoyment.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It never let me play it kicks you out at the loading menu so dont download this or buy this app it sucks and never plays
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Fast delivery! Product was just as promised and was packaged well. I can not wait to watch it! I was so happy it came quickly as it was a birthday present!
B0068G6LQ2|5.0|You have to watch all seasons. This show unravels into chaos, love, friendship, murder, aggression and much more. It will keep you wanting to watch episode after episode. Start from the beginning so you can get all the information as this show is intensely overwhelming if you don't. I highly recommend watching this show. Totally worth every penny.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters are very believable and likable. I was drawn in and had a very enjoyable fantasy ride. I can't wait to get the next in the series.

B001U88814|5.0|These are some of the most comfortable Crocs out there, if no the most. I used these up in Massachusetts when visiting my family during the holidays and they kept my feet warm outside in frigid northeast temperatures.<br /><br />They were so popular among my family memebers that 2 of my brothers and both my parents picked up a pair of their own. They are a little bit heavier than normal crocs because of the soft lining, thicker sole, and the lack of ventilation. That being said, these will not be suitable for summer or warmer days. They fit on your foot exceptionally well and will not slip off if sized correctly. I am I true size 10.5 and an 11 fits me perfectly. I think the lining makes the fit a little more snug. So it might be a good idea to get this shoe in a little bit of a larger size.<br /><br />As far as the slipper idea goes, i think these are the best slippers on the market. The fancy memory foam and sheepskin slippers tend to wear out too quickly and become uncomfortable when they do. Crocs just last for a long time through pretty rough use and abuse. for the money, these are a great slipper option. I highly recommend these shoes for either an all-round winter croc or slipper.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|It's amazing how powerful the effect of our habits are on ourselves. This is a must get book if you have destructive habits that you need to correct. It's not a typical approach but gave my husband ways to overcome without \\"thinking about it\\" all the time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|absolutely a great game very nice on kindle fire recommend for anyone who loves puzzle games a definite must have
0062060562|5.0|I loved that this was a story I didn't feel like I had read before. I decided to read it based on the reviews I had read and I'm glad that I did. I honestly couldn't put it down!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I only have the free version but I love it! I work long weekends and this defiantly helps time fly!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Seriously, this book is the best of the three, and it's probably one of my favorite books ever. I finished the series and I don't know where to go from here!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Motorola xoom.  the grandfather of android and yet game loads freezes at menu screen.  worse than that after you hit home button sound plays in your background until you reboot your tablet.  Here is a clue Pop cap don't charge me if it doesn't work.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|Based on how good The Maze Runner was I was so excited to read The Scorch Trials. When I finished that book I was a little disappointed considering they were walking in a desert for two weeks. Althought it wasn't as great as the first I still liked it. I was so excited when I got The Death Cure and I couldn't wait to read it. I just finished the book and again I was angry with James Dashner.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />First off, Newt was one of my favorite characters and I absolutley hated how he was not immune to the Flare. I could have cared less if it was Brenda who died because I'm not a big fan of hers. Not to mention, he made Thomas be the one who killed him. I mean it was kind of obvious that he would have to but still. The simple solution would be to make Brenda die and Newt live. Then, when everyone was escaping WICKED at the end, no matter how much I disliked Teresa I still wish she didn't die. Again I wish it was Brenda. My other problem was how you never really know what happens and it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I wish that Dashner would have elaborated more or at least made Thomas get his memory back to answer those questions. I think there were to many deaths to great characters in the end and that annoyed me a lot.<br /><br />In the end I was disappointed in this book but the series overall was very good. I would recommend it to people who like action packed books and I guess to those who like not getting all of their questions answered. It is a great and easy read and I can only hope the world doesn't get to be this bad.
B004H3W3TM|3.0|Wonderful and detailed story however a very,very long read. One of the few books you have to put down from time to time. I would not see the movie then read the book - read the bonk then see the movie in my opinion.
B0013FBS20|5.0|I didn't think you could retell another zombi story but this movie<br />does and is able to tell it from a new and original angels.<br />Will Smith makes it work. If you even remotely like future<br />end of life as we know it stories check this one out.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Having video ads run between hands really is discussing. Prior to this a pop up ad appeared, now video begins whenever you deal a new hand.  Enjoyed it before but not now. Not recommend until the video is eliminated.
B002T9H2L0|2.0|Personally didn't care for the mixing of fact and fantasy.<br />Seem more like an excuse for acting out some repressed<br />need for violence than a story line. Would not recommend.<br />The acting was good, the story was not.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This book is an excellent introduction to mindfulness meditation for anyone, including skeptics, agnostics, and people who are wary of anything that seems remotely flaky. I became interested in learning more about the practice because of the well substantiated scientific evidence showing the real physical and mental benefits of the practice.  Jon Kabat-Zinn is an inspired and brilliant writer who makes a compelling case for the transforming power of mindfulness meditation.  His practical advice and real life examples make the practice accessible to anyone.
B000N39HOE|1.0|This item actually is as described, but is definately NOT as pictured or priced!  This is the run-of-the-mill Consumer Edition SACD set, NOT (as pictured and priced) the 'Limited Numbered Edition' costlier offering.<br />Many vendors on Amazin AS YOU READ THIS have this item for less than $32 and I recommend you buy one from the vendor until Amazon gets the price and image sorted and appropriate.<br />Amazon HAS been notified by me and the vendor I purchased from after sending back this item for a refund and contacting a CSR re the problem, and submitting price feedback.<br /><br />That being said, as far as the music and SACD itself are concerned, this is a glorious  SACD set. The 3 SACDs are top-notch, and the ambience startling compared to the plain CD version - itself an amazing CD!<br />A GREAT SACD set to have - especially at the right price of around $32. The 'Limited Numbered Edition\\" would be wonderful at this $88 pricepoint if Amazon were to offer it, also.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game it is very fun.  I got this for free. the congealed work for me. and there is different. level all ate fun and challenging.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|It's fun and all but once you put something in storage you never and I mean NEVER. That is really all I got to say.
B0060ZJ78U|2.0|I really wanted to like this film but found that the interesting idea behind it -- forming a team not out of expensive stars but out of just the right players --  was given only about five or six sentences in the whole film.  Most of the time we were watching Brad Pitt looking frustrated or driving around Oakland or walking around the Oakland Colosseum.  Poor Jonah Hill has very few lines.  Most of the time he seems tongue-tied.  We watch the players playing but often don't quite know what we're supposed to be looking for.  The flashbacks to the Pitt character's youth seem mostly gratuitous.  I gave this film two stars instead of one because the photography was competent by today's low standards and because the baseball scouts, office people, etc. seemed very authentic. Otherwise, if you don't like using many words to explain an idea, why not just make a silent movie?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its not that bad...I mean I wouldn't play it all the time but it is sorta fun I guess un.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|Loved the movie, had me intrigued all the way. Highly recommended.<br />Can't believe how many great actors were in the movie, scary thought that it could all become true.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Rating it 2 because it is so short.  Good graphics and fun to go through but it just needs to last longer...perhaps a sequel is coming since Grandpa has \\"much to show\\" as the epilogue says. App should have been free, not worth the cost.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I ripped through all 3 of these books in 3 days and it is totally worth it!  Watching the developing relationship between Ana and Christian is exhilarating, suspenseful, painful and joyous.  My emotions ran rampant with every page turned and I loved it!  Buy them all because you'll want to read them one right after the other!
0439023513|5.0|Every now and again, you come across a book that makes you examine life and really think about the world.  I found myself thinking about the story hours, even days, after I read it, still as engrossed in the story and the world as when I was reading it.<br />Suzanne Collins has created a world that seems so real and so believable that you can imagine every single thing in this book happening.  You care about the characters and what happens to them; and oh, do things happen.<br />As stated in the title, this is up there with my favorite books/stories of all time.  As for the movies, neither the second or third books lend themselves well to adaptation.  Especially Mockingjay, the third.  But I still look forward to them.<br />In conclusion, this story wraps up beautifully, if not how you would expect. There is a real sense of \\"the end\\", but you are left wanting more.  Oh, and if you don't get at least a little teary-eyed in the last few pages, especially the last two sentences of the book, you have no soul.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I absolutely love Angry Birds. It's one of my favorite things in the whole world. There are three versions so far: the original, Seasons, and the Rio crossover. In this game, chapters are added depending on the month(February:Valentine's, March: St. Patty's Day, etc.) and are given a pig-themed title (i.e.-Ham'o'ween). The thing I have to critique is that the look of the pigs. They're ugly. If you've played the Google Chrome version of the original Angry Birds, you know what I mean. Google got an update on the looks of the Green Bird and the Pigs. I wish they would do that on all systems. It's still a good game, though. I just wish they would update the looks of the birds and pigs.
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun time killer that's free. its great that it runs when you don't have it open. I'm addicted. for sure
B005UT29Z0|3.0|Most of us know about the 2008 Wall St. meltdown, few of us understand it. Going into this movie, which is based on a true story, I expected to be educated somewhat in Wall St. lingo and come away knowing what MBS (Mortgage backed securities) are and, how they ended up being integral in bringing down an entire industry. Sadly, I came away knowing as much as when I went in.<br /><br />The movie is slow paced and focus is liberally scattered between the key players. A day of firings, at the financial securities firm, sees one who is exiting hand over a thumb drive to an upcoming newer guy with the parting words \\"Be careful\\". The thumb drives holds a financial model that heralds the impending doom of the company due to overexposure in the MBS market. High level meetings figure it's time to start dumping those securities and a crazy day of selling worthless securities ensues.<br /><br />That's basically it. There are one or two points where the characters discuss the ethics surrounding the knowledge that they are indeed selling junk in an attempt to lower their own risk (Save their own a$$es). Buyer beware ? Who knows the games played on Wall St. But, take Wall St. out the picture and apply the same logic to any situation and ask yourself, what would YOU knowingly do to save your self?<br /><br />It's a cutthroat/competitive world and, in the world of high finance, I'm sure the scale of competitiveness has higher numbers on it.<br /><br />The movie is 1hr and 42 minutes and, seems to end way too abruptly. We don't get into the aftermath of the day of trading and the viewer is left wondering, ok, what was all that about?<br /><br />Personally, I feel this movie should have been longer. A summary of the mechanics of the MBS securities would have been very helpful along with at least 20 minutes spent showing us the aftermath of the day of trading. The constant overtone is impending doom on a grand scale yet, I wasn't sure why? It hadn't been explained to me why these men were so in fear for the world. I felt I didn't learn anything useful but, overall, I enjoyed the movie for the sake of the movie.<br /><br />Spacey, as always, is brilliant, Jeremy Irons, again, brilliant and the other cast members were as good as they needed to be. It's a somewhat dark movie and there is little, if any, lighter moments.<br /><br />3 stars is all I could muster despite the wealth of talent. Like a few other reviewers, it took me more than one sitting to get through the movie and, like I mentioned, I was left more hungry than when I sat down to watch.ere so in fear for the world.

1935597760|5.0|I just loved this book!!! It was was an easy flowing read. The author (of course) was spot on in keeping with the Irish vocabulary. I felt like I was there with the characters feeling the sadness and revelations!  I believe I would read this book again in the future which is unheard of for me! I have made this book a suggestion for our local book club!
B004EWEX9Y|3.0|wow, apple has done it again another $40 cable that isn't interchangeable. yes it does hook my ipod classic up to the tv, should it have cost $40 no way does it work with all your other apple stuff no way.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is another smash hit by Jamie McGuire. I completely understand why this is her best selling novel. The characters and their development in this story are incredibly compelling. You don't want to put the book (or your kindle) down for even a moment until you uncover all of their secrets. Just when you think the story has come full circle, at about the halfway point, she adds another facet and throws you for another loop. And you JUST KEEP READING! Seriously, if you want a great story with many different directions to follow, characters you will not forget and a love story on top of all that....this will be a book you add to your favorites and keep reading over and over again!<br /><br />-Just My Opinion ([...]or twitter @JustmyopinionNH or Facebook [...])

B0072GPQ72|4.0|I had only one complaint.<br />Too much close ups of old guys nostrils,and not enough of the star !!<br /><br />When he jumped all the bttle field fences,heck he was home,movie over.<br />So with more star close ups,esp with him running,the movie would be a 10
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Okay, so I got this app thinking that it would be like the original angry birds, kind of like when they came put for seasons, but it wasn't. It's way too easy and nothing like the original angry birds concerning the graphics and setting.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Totally worth it- we have netflix which only goes to season 3.  It felt a little expensive, but compared to paying for cable every month, this is totally worth it- nothing like having a BB marathon
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I used this many times a day on the Kindle Fire.  However, since this latest update (first week of March) the maps are not loading properly or animating, plus I have to force close before I am finished.  It worked flawlessly for months and was in the top three of my most used apps.  Hope there is another update soon and it smooths out again.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I found this to be an excellent book with several interwoven plots which made it a real page turner.  I know this is one of a trilogy by the same author and regretfully I was unaware that it was in fact the third in the series. I would have preferred to read them in the correct order.  The only difficulty that I had was the large number of characters in the story who all had (understandably) Swedish names.  It was sometimes difficult to recall what they had previously done in the story because many of the names appeared similar in print to a different character.  I am aware that the series has since been filmed and this medium would make the story easier to follow.  It was purchased from Amazon Kindle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game. I love the soccer ball game. it is even better that it is free....GREAT! GAME! very good.I am just saying this to get 20 words.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|I don't get it its stupid who would want to get this ads all over the screen u cant hardly play such a waste of space
B004132HZS|5.0|When I saw these were coming on television last year I decided to ignore them. Any  of the 're-imaginings' or 'updated' versions I have seen were disappointing. I figured it would be another paltry attempt to wring something out of the fans.<br />By accident, while channel surfing and waiting for another programme to start I saw the end of episode one, 'A Study in Pink'. Suffice to say I was galvanised into frustration and admiration. Admiration for what they had done to my hero and frustrated because I had missed most if it. Due to commitments I missed seeing all three of the episodes but managed to get a copy of the DVD which, so far, I have watched approximately five times. Well I have watched the first episode and the third, 'The Great Game' five times. I watched the second and decided that it is quite weak compared to the other two. Maybe a victim to the 'sequel' curse?<br />Benedict Cumberbatch is wonderfully quirky as Sherlock, how could you not be with a name like that. Martin Freeman is a perfect incarnation of Dr.Watson. The show is well written, well constructed, it also has respect for the original. Wonderful!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to kill time. No annoying backgrounds or sound effects. Works well on Kindle Fire.  Uploaded for free so price was definitely right!
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I happened across this movie on Cinemax while flipping channels a while back and had to stop and watch it for a bit. I'd heard that the movie was primarily for young adults, but being a fan of Greek mythology I thought I'd try it out. What a fun movie. It has humor, great visuals and it's chock full of all the heroes and monsters you've read about for years. Not as action-packed as say, Clash of the Titans...but it also doesn't take itself quite as seriously. The Blu-Ray version looks and sounds phenomenal, and the Digital Copy bonus never hurts. If you're just looking for an entertaining evening with the gods, give Percy Jackson a chance.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the rain is a book for every dog lover who suffered a loss. As with humans,dogs have lives that we can only imagine. If they could communicate in our language or we in theirs, perhaps we would learn the secrets of loyalty, love and unconditional love. The book was sensitively written, and brought comfort to a soul who lost her best pal not a few weeks before. If only we could prove it to be true. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts on this wonderful book. It is appropriate for all ages, though children under ten might find it too emotional. Here's to Enzo!
B0042MDAL8|4.0|My wife had been hinting for a while that she really wanted to see the latest movie in the \\"Twilight\\" saga at the theater, but beyond the basic notion of it being about vampires I had no idea about the backstory. So, on to Amazon I went...and picked up all of the Blu-Ray releases thus far. I hate to admit it, but these movies are mesmerizing. The acting is just so-so, the story is a little convoluted and to top it all off the friggin vampires sparkle in the sunlight. All that being said, you really can't help being drawn into this world and these characters. The movies may lack a little when it comes to vampire lore, but the whole package somehow just works. The high-def transfers look really good, and my only complaint about the discs is that the dialogue always seems overpowered by the score, even when run through a home theater system.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Sophie was an awesome character, not too hard core and not too soft!<br /><br />Once I got midway... I couldn't but the dang thing down! Very enjoyable read. I'm ready for the next book by this author!
B0052U59F4|5.0|All I can say is \\"WOW!\\"  And...Where do I meet Mr. Grey?! You will not be able to put this book down. It's naughty and intoxicating at the same time.  I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. reading and couldn't put it down.  If you need a real page turner this is the book for you.  If only I was on vacation, this would be the perfect read.  I was reading it on the subway and found myself blushing.  I just downloaded the next book and can't wait to see what transpires between Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I read someone complained about the directing of this video. Who cares?? I watched this in digital surround sound. Adele is amazing, awesome, etc, etc.<br />I understand some people were put off by swearing in between songs, but it was not inappropriate to me. Adele reminds me of a Liza Dolittle to hear her speak and then hear her sing the songs is all the more stunning.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|It is hard to give a higher score when the potential for it to be far greater is still there. So one is left wanting far more.

B006UIYXL8|2.0|I just about walked out on this film because it was boring. There is no plot. There is a constant theme about homosexuality, but that has no interest to me.<br /><br />I found the acting poor except Clyde Tolson's performance.<br /><br />The filming I thought was good<br /><br />The makeup showing aging was poor I thought.<br /><br />My advice, a must miss.

6302787556|5.0|Surprisingly, as Denzel Washington is not an actor I like and Malcolm X being a character, I do not like or respect but consider to be a nutcase - a pedlar of racism and black power. I am saying I liked this film very much.<br /><br />Also after seeing this movie, I can feel more from where Malcom X came from and where he wanted to go.<br /><br />The acting overall was extremely good. I would say that everyone played very well. Denzel Washington here I think made a terrific performance<br /><br />The characters were interesting as was the story.<br /><br />However as I do not know much about the characters, I cannot comment about the accuracy, but I suspect that for a movie, it is good. The Wikipedia article seems to confirm most of it. One slight problem, I picked up on accuracy nutmeg will get you high but only after many hours.<br /><br />The actual filming was very good.<br /><br />Would I see it again, no as I have seen it, but I would recommend it?
B006KX3GXO|2.0|This app is one of the best apps I ever used! I recommend it for other people to use as well.
0307346609|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what so many others have said about the book (let alone repeat the plot), I'll just say that the author creates an incredibly authentic tale, and a cast of real people that describe what could be any great epidemic or catastrophic event such as a major war. If it wasn't for the fact that no zombies exist, you'd think he was a historian, not a fiction writer. Can't compliment him enough on this achievement, and can't recommend enough what has been a real page-turner for me.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee's story is written with the immaturity and childishness of a girl who was stolen from the world when she was 11 years old. I think it is the perfect narration for her story, and I am honored that she chose to share her ordeal with the world. It shows her willingness to live \\"with a heart wide open\\" - and portrays her amazing spirit and her optimism and ability \\"to make the best of things\\" that will bring her out the other side of this as a whole and complete person.<br /><br />Jaycee - my heart is filled with happiness that you are free to become whoever you want to be.<br /><br />I hope your message is held in the hearts of millions - if something about a family seems \\"off\\" or not right, SPEAK OUT - you might save a life.<br /><br />I give a book 5 stars only if I can't put it down. Jaycee's story captivated me.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Holy crap, $34.99 right now on Amazon.com? This is going to be the best Blu-ray deal for a long time. Fans of the Book series and the TV show, please do not miss out on HBO's finest in epic adult fantasy storytelling. Blu-Ray High Def is going to be the best way to watch this show. The best thing about Game of Thrones season 1? Anticipating season 2 a month later! :D
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very fun because it has all the things I like to play. like fishing, snake, missles, cookies,and a lot more. I just really like theese games.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game because its so fun and challenging.  I recommend everyone to buy this game. Its fun for your kids to play and everyone to play go to the app store and buy it  right now.
B004LP601S|2.0|Allright dont get me wrong I really like Panic at the Disco.  I have listened to them from their first alphum.  Liking both Pretty Odd and A Fevor You Cant Sweat Out.  But unfortunly Vices and Virtues fell short.<br />Basically A Fevor You Cant Sweat Out was like there were a young rebelious kid.  Full of anger and energy.  But Pretty Odd was the exact oppisite it was like your biggest brother you look up too and admire.  They matured in that alphum.  But with Vices and Virtues they took a step backwards.  They really only had two good songs and that was Lets Kill Tonight and Hurricane.<br />I hope they do better on there next alphum.
B0071QIN00|5.0|this game is addictive loads of levels and challenging.  Iv had this game for a month and I'm still playing it.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|Older movie but still a classic one to watch.  Of course we love Paul Newman.  Very entertaining and enjoyable.  Good family movie showing the rough past life.

0062068423|5.0|The ONLY thing I look for in a book is a \\"good read\\".  I don't care if the characters could have been developed more or if described events or places are outrageously presented.  I just want a \\"good read\\"!  (Strange comment for someone with a BA/MA in English, don't you think?)  Some \\"reviewers\\" feel it necessary to recount the entire plot.  That's not a \\"review\\" - that's a summery.  Bottom line...this is a real good read.  So much so that I have bought all the other Harry Hole novels (there are six translated so far). I will say only this about the story...Harry finds a body in one hell of a hiding place!  A suggestion to some \\"reviewers\\" out there: limit your comments to what you like/dislike without a longwinded plot narrative ESPECIALLY ones that disclose endings.  In fact, if you want to write about an ending, a simple \\"liked it\\" or \\"didn't like it\\" is appropriate for most potential buyers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent app. I love the way you can create your own settings, changing the background and deck to suit you. Its great that I can use my own photo for the deck. It has interested my kids enough to learn how to play the game. Now they play it all the time!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I've waited a long time for a show like American Horror Story. I think a lot of people have because it's so different from anything else on television. I would compare it's insanity to that of Nip/Tuck, which makes sense when you realize the same creators are behind it. The first episode will probably confuse most people, but stick with it. Each episode will answer questions from the previous ones and leave you with even more than the last. The cast is beyond superb. Jessica Lange as neighbor Constance is the homerun of the series for me. She plays that role with such conviction and is very deserving of the Emmy Award she won. The rest of the cast is top-notch as well, including Connie Britton (you may know her from Friday Night Lights) who's character is put through an emotional rollercoaster throughout the entire season.<br /><br />This show plays off as creepy more than scary, but it works splendidly. American Horror Story is definitely out there. Sometimes you'll just scratch your head and think, \\"what is going on?\\". Then you'll figure it out and it's well worth the confusion. They tackle some dark subject matter and this is really not a show for kids. You'll find a good bit of nudity and sexual situations for a show on cable. The language is pretty harsh as well, but the show wouldn't be as effective without it. My advice to anyone who starts watching this show, don't give up after the first episode. The second episode will clear up some questions you'll have about it and then there's no stopping there! This is one of the best shows on TV today. The originality, writing, and acting are all A++. I can't wait for season 2!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|This was never in danger of being nominated for an Oscar, but it is a lot of fun.<br /><br />I like a movie that entertains, and this certainly does it. Surprisingly, with a minimum of foul language and gratuitous gore (except for the monsters).<br /><br />Pop some popcorn, grab some beer, and just enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|classic version of the game very easy to play blah blah. blah blah good screen simple graphics three more words

B001A3GSFW|5.0|I bought this tee for my 14 year old daughter and she LOVED it. She says all her freinds think it's \\"cool\\". Fast ship, and product just as described.
B005DKLPF6|4.0|Great songs, very catchy, great riffs, great tones and the vocals are actually sung well with awesome melodies but TURN UP THE GUITARS!!!  Seriously there are spots on this record where I cant make out the killer guitar leads because the vocals take over everything!  Wanna add singing/clean vocals?  Great!  But don't forget the heavy guitars... when vocals are mixed this loud it makes the music not sound as loud/not heavy.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have found this version of mahjong to be uncomplicated and challenging.  Hours of entertainment.  Well worth the price.  Far superior to most other versions I've played in the past.
0307352145|5.0|Ordered this book for my wife based on a review in a news magazine. She really enjoyed the book and found it very interesting and informative. Answered a lot of questions for her. I am going to read it also. This book seems especially prescient in a world and a campaign season in this country where there are so many loud voices. How nice to have someone believable say that it's okay to sit, be quiet, and listen to our inner voice.
1609611543|5.0|If you read this book, you'll be glad you did, and you'll have a healthier, longer life. An eye-opening, facinating, unforgetable experience
B00785P2QC|4.0|This city-building game (with emphasis on building) is almost an exact copy of G5's Virtual City except its not divided into levels at different locations and you can do things on your own schedule instead of rushing to meet a time goal. Not having to unlock everything bit by bit is like a bonus, but collecting enough credits and investment points without in-game purchase is really hard. Wish it was a lot less like Virtual City, since I already paid for that one.

B004V2AWKG|3.0|I downloaded this book onto my reader. Could hardly put it down; loved it. Until I came to the end. What? It just left you hanging, not knowing what the imagery was, not knowing whether Jonas was \\"there\\" or not. I looked it up online to make sure I hadn't had a hiccup when I downloaded and only got half the book. Nope. This book could have been great if the end was the middle. Very disappointing and dissatisfying.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book so much I went back and purchased his other two. He has a great writing style. It is if you combined  Grisham and Turow. The book is a page turner right until the end.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Never been much of a Foo Fighters fan. Loved Nirvana, liked a few Foo songs over the years, but this is the first Foo Fighters disc I've bought. Simply stellar from first song to last. This disc is visceral in that when turned up loud (the way it should be), is what rock-n-roll is all about. Being in my 40s, this is the first disc in the last 20 years to make me feel like I felt the first time I heard Bleach. Not to say that this disc sounds like Nirvana or anything, but it's just THAT FEELING. Thank you Dave Grohl for this wonderful rock-n-roll disc...it's been soooo long!
B005SH5K7I|5.0|I loved this movie really enjoyed it Its funny romantic so enjoyable to watch. I liked it so much my grand children watched it on my. Kindle fire also and some friends also a must buy a movie you can watch over and over
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I have watched many Jane Eyres and loved them all but this one was boring.  Why have her start out at the rochester mansion and recall her life as a child and at the lowwood school. It was changed to much to like it. I wish i never bought it. They should have started with her as a child moved on to the rochester house and then carried on further than any other Jane Eyre.
B006CDCWDM|4.0|The way the book is written is different - it described what was going through Rafa's mind during his Wimbledon 2008 match against Federer. It explained how Rafa gets his motivation and how his upbringing shaped him to be what he is today.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard a lot about this trilogy from friends and from other reviews and I have to say it was more than I expected, after reading it on my kindle I bought the books. It had me from the start and I had to fight to put it down. Just amazing.

B004301UP2|5.0|My granddaughter wanted the first two seasons of Glee for her birthday. I wanted to give her one and her brother wanted to give her one. We could only find season two on Blue Ray in stores so I purchased from Amazon.  She received season two from her brother on her birthday but because we had shopped for so long the season one disc actually arrived after her birthday.  She is old enough that I put the order form in her birthday card so she knew it was being shipped and was fine with that. The order came as requested on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend ordering early for hard to find in store items.
4789009637|3.0|I am using the 44th printing (2007) of the 1999 textbook's first edition.<br /><br />The book is published by The Japan Times which may explain the failure to issue a new edition through that decade.<br /><br />There is now a second edition (Oct 27, 2011) at this amazon page:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Genki-Integrated-Elementary-Japanese-Edition/dp/4789014436<br /><br />Were the workbooks updated?<br /><br />Students are often glad that the same edition is used year after year when buying used textbooks.  But imagine using a 1979 text unchanged in 1987 (no personal computers, no laptop computers, odd-looking radio-telephones ...)<br /><br />There is an edition of this older version with a CD but it is not clear to me that the textbook was improved.
B006QKJZMW|2.0|The original Hostel was IMHO a pretty good horror movie...lots of gore and thrills. Usually sequal's don't measure up to the original in most cases. There have been a few that were as good or better then the original...The Godfather part 2 IMHO was better then part one...that is a rarity and not the norm.<br /><br />Hostel part 2 came close to being as good but IMHO missed the target, but only slightly. Hostel part 3 lets say missed the target completely and totaly backfired. I won't get into the details about every aspect of the movie. the producers were hoping to ride the wave of part 1 and 2. the only similarity is the title of the movie...In Parts 1 and 2 the movie unfold in a foreign country and seemed to be realistic, actually in true life this sort of thing does happen in the black market of kidnapping (we are talking about part 1 here)..but to think this is happening in Las Vegas or trying to somewhat think this is realistic was an uphill battle that was a total failure.<br /><br />Who would be pleased with watching this movie...Only true blue fans of anything that resembles gore...there is no rhyme or reason to the plot.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I just finished reading this book on kindle touch. The footnotes are key in this novel and it was difficult or impossible to get to them.  Sometimes I would touch the number and it would jump to the note.  Other times it would try to define the number.<br />I definitely missed some of the jokes. You may want to get the print version.  Its a good story.
B002VPE1XY|3.0|This product fits best with a very slim camera - I thought mine was small enough, and it pushes it out to capacity. Which makes it kind of bulky.  What I was really looking for, though, was a belt clip - like a hard clip.  This has a velcro type clip (not really a clip) that you could put through a belt loop.  I don't always where a belt and was looking for something more like a cell phone clip.<br /><br />It's well made, but I am disappointed with the size and lack of sturdy clip.

B003SNJZ3Y|5.0|Sebastian Mallaby will get you acquainted  with the trading secrets of the biggest hedge funds.The book is inside look behind the mechanisme how the hedge funds operate .What I like the most about book is how S Mallaby in his writing paying  attention to the personalities who has funded and run the show.From the open sources you will get the fragmented pieces of information about subject often very bias and the book is great how to filter the informations and show you the whole picture of the hedge funds world.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Had to uninstall this app due to too many ads popping up after every other game.  Very annoying! Games are also pretty boring.
B003R50F00|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The imagery and powerfully descriptive writing captivated me to the very last page and I saved quite a few clippings from this ebook. Towards the end, I slowed down, simply because I didn't want it to end. It took a couple of chapters to get into and I wasn't sure this was my sort of book, but if you feel that way after reading the sample, stick with it and read the rest, it's well worth it. I particularly liked how well it portrayed the life of a young girl living in Nazi Germany, without going into too much detail about the horrific things that happened, which would have made it too morbid and depressing. Its one of the few books I've read where the characters had a real impact on me, making the story all the more moving.

1469984202|5.0|I suspect this author can write a story about paint drying and the reader will actually care.  Do not expect light reading.  You will become engrossed almost immediately.  I prefer reading about a hero (easier to indentify with) but the heroine of this story is superb.  I'm only upset that I didn't find him sooner.  Calling this book science fiction is like calling a corvette a car. This is a book you will not regret buying.
B00457WZEI|1.0|I had thought I downloaded this onto my iPad, but it never showed up anyway.  How do I retrieve it and where?  I really was wanting to read it, but now may not.
1400049628|5.0|I haven't read the book, but all of my friends did back in high school and they loved it, so I bought one for my brother for Christmas.

B000TEUSJK|4.0|After years of hearing about this film, I finally obtained a copy of it and found it to be every bit as wild and controversial as I'd always heard. Interesting that there were never any other films of this type, that being a production that included top rated actors & actresses, high dollar production values and an intriguing story line too boot. Aside from the low quality of the cinematograpy, I was pleased with this purchase. It definitely was a memorable film to watch.
0061537969|5.0|This book is a great story about life and I particularly encourage non dog owners to understand the life of a dog and the dog's family.  Enzo's perspectives capture what we should be looking for in life-- both on the surface and at deeper levels.  This is a book that can make you cry and laugh at the same time.  I have felt that my now deceased golden retriever would have said the same that Enzo said, but he lacked Enzo's words.  Don't wait to read this and hopefully someday this will be a great movie.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Great graphics. Easy to add locations. And where else can you see a list of all the earthquake activity in the world?
B006W0QOF2|1.0|the previews seem to almost be out of context it makes the movie look exciting and action/drama packed, this couldn't be further from the truth.... looks like it was directed by some film student full of long pointless seens with \\"dramatic\\" not... pause shots with light and abstract effects. If you like horrible pointless french films with-out the subtitles then this is for you otherwise  DRIVE clear of this waist of bandwidth
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Jurassic Park (3/5)<br /><br />I need to get one thing out of the way first - I hate those awful children. Spielberg often makes huge mistakes when casting children in his movies (Hook, the aggravating Henry Thomas), but the JP kids really get on my nerves. He should have done with little Tim and Lex what he did to Alex Kintner in Jaws in have them devoured in torrents of gore. This would have pleased me a great deal.<br /><br />Sam Neill (one of my favorite actors) plays Alan Grant, a dinosaur expert who is called to a remote Pacific island with his colleague Ellie Sattler and Chaos theorist Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) by excitable billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to give a fresh perspective on his new theme park and appease his anxious investors (although why a billionaire would need investors is kind of odd). The theme park turns out to be a dinosaur zoo, but nothing works as it should.<br /><br />Park computer nerd Dennis Nedry (Peter Griffin in a rare live-action role) shuts down the security in order to smuggle dino embryos to the competition, and with the electric fences switched off the big things with pointy teeth step out into the bits of the park where they're not supposed to be.<br /><br />Jurassic Park has often been nicknamed \\"Jaws with Claws\\". I don't think that's a good description. Where Jaws was a difficult shoot, was organic, and was a huge hit against expectations, Jurassic Park is deliberately designed to be a blockbuster without any of the raw edge that made its big brother so believable. I just can't get excited by a film that was made to sell merchandise.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of Jurassic Park, is often the most overlooked. Dean Cundey's photography is great, full of darkness and backlights. I just wish that Spielberg allowed him to give the film a harder look as it sometimes has a fake, plastic feel. The CGI, having been rendered just a little shy of 20 years ago, are mostly photo-realistic but there are a few dinos that look incredibly fake (the brontosaurus on the grass plain looks terrible).<br /><br />When making Jaws, the animatronic shark rarely worked. With nothing much to show on screen Spielberg compensated by giving us lots of shark POV shots, and Williams gave the unseen predator a constant presence with his iconic score. Now, in an age where filmmakers can give us anything with a computer effect (in a way, Spielberg made this trend mainstream with the success of Jurassic Park), the monsters are brought right out into the open, lessening our fear of them. A monster is only scary when it is in the shadows. Bruce the Shark was also an unstoppable force of nature, his random appearance out of nowhere giving him a mythical edge. The dinos in Jurassic Park were designed, within the movie, to entertain kids, and intended, as a movie, to entertain the kids in the audience.<br /><br />They're not scary.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is a good film, but it absolutely does not deserve the classic status that pop culture has marked it with.<br /><br />The Lost World (3.5/5)<br /><br />I enjoyed The Lost World more than Jurassic Park, it's a darker, bloodier film with a higher body count, and, visually, it's a lot more complex. It's a shame that Dean Cundey didn't return (Spielberg never worked with him again, and hired Janusz Kami'ski this time around) though. The story is almost the same thing done again, but it doesn't have those awful kids in it...much.<br /><br />Set four years after the Isla Nublar incident, Ian Malcolm is forced by John Hammond to confront the dinos once more on Isla Sorna (or Site B), the place where InGen bred the animals before moving them to Jurassic Park. The InGen board have taken control of the company and prepare to move the dinos to the mainland. But not before 80 minutes of gobbling up the lesser characters. Yes, it's derivative, but it gives us less of what made JP bad, and more of what made it good.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of trims and cutsto The Lost World. It doesn't make for any distinct continuity errors but there are some noticeable jumps in the pacing. There have been many complaints that the film is overlong, however I think that it's more exciting than the original. There are some nail-biting scenes (the trailers hanging over the cliff) and the dinos are scarier this time. I love the ending with the T-Rex storming around San Diego.<br /><br />Again, there have loads of complaints that this ending is over-the-top, which I think is a ridiculous grievance. Action movies build to a big finish and, since JP1 and JP3 had no climax at all, the Lost World has the best ending of the trilogy. There's no theme of mankind playing God this time, just straight-up action, which also seems like a bit of a waste considering Ian Malcolm's cerebral analysis of the situation on Site A. There are some attempts at character arcs, but they fall flat. I really don't care about Pete Postlethwaite suddenly becoming disillusioned after capturing the T-Rex, and they missed the opportunity for Malcolm to tell them 'I told you so' when chaos erupts. And am I the only one who got confused at the fact that the characters of Ludlow and Ajay look virtually identical? Bad casting choices there, man.<br /><br />Despite all of this, I still think The Lost World is better than the first, even if all the cons negate the pros, it doesn't have those horrible children (apart from 3 minutes at the start).<br /><br />Jurassic Park III 3/5<br /><br />Spielberg bailed. He was too busy bringing AI: Artificial Intelligence to the screen. Joe Johnston, a more than capable director himself, stepped in delivered a decent timewaster, but failed to give us anything new and didn't even bother to attempt an epic.<br /><br />Above and beyond all things, what cripples Jurassic Park 3 the most is the brief running time. The film fades out at the 84-minute mark, which is just unacceptable. The previous films were epics and both clocked in at over 2 hours. Why on earth did Universal take their biggest franchise at the time and cut it down to this? It beggars belief. The film feels like a TV pilot more than it does a cinematic event. But it does manage to cram in more action than the entire of the first film alone within those 84 minutes.<br /><br />Strange since the budget was $30 million higher than Jurassic Park in 1993. But the effects have improved drastically in that 8 year gap. I was never too keen or impressed with the CGI in the first film. The dinosaurs just didn't look right, but if you dared to criticize the film at the time you would have been shouted down.<br /><br />A lot of story concepts came and went before they, unimaginatively, settled on a \\"same again\\" scenario with yet another extended chase on Isla Sorna. Some of the scenes are even recycled unused sequences that never made the final script edit in the first two. At least they brought back Sam Neill as Alan Grant and had a small role for Laura Dern. William H. Macy provides great support too. It's good to see him do action for a change. And the kid in this one is far, far, far less aggravating than those annoying brats in the original film.<br /><br />John Williams didn't return, instead leaving the scoring chore Don Davis who made an adequate, if hardly memorable, attempt. All the good stuff is Williams' themes from the other movies. And since he made a few themes for this one I will assume that any noteworthy cues within were actually Williams' contributions, and not Davis', who I have never really liked.<br /><br />The action IS brilliantly done though, and the Spinosaurus, the new villain is quite scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends! That is my biggest problem with JP3. The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.<br /><br />I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effects alone.<br /><br />The Blu Rays present all 3 films in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound and loads of extras. Most of these are just ported over from the old DVDs, but there are new HD retrospectives included, and they're pretty good. The box itself is a digipak with a slip. The cardboard is very flimsy and cheap. Universal made a great effort all round, but they failed at the packaging. If this bugs you I guess you could fork out more money to buy for the [[ASIN:B005YGCSRI Jurassic Park: Ultimate Trilogy (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy SteelBook)]].ours.

The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.<br /><br />I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effects alone.<br /><br />The Blu Rays present all 3 films in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound and loads of extras. Most of these are just ported over from the old DVDs, but there are new HD retrospectives included, and they're pretty good. The box itself is a digipak with a slip. The cardboard is very flimsy and cheap. Universal made a great effort all round, but they failed at the packaging. If this bugs you I guess you could fork out more money to buy for the [[ASIN:B005YGCSRI Jurassic Park: Ultimate Trilogy (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy SteelBook)]].
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie was such a surprise! Judging by the cover picture I didn't think that I would enjoy this movie as much as I did. I don't want to give any of the movie away but let's just say that it turns everything that we think about horror movies on it's head! You do not want to miss this movie, if u can appreciate gallows humor then this is the movie for u!
B0041C8TME|5.0|Great quality. I use this every day as my dashboard camera and mount. It is nice because you can keep it plugged into the lighter outlet so you don't run the battery down. Can't say enough about it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Easy way to kill time. The games I have played so far have been simple to pick up on but remain challenging too.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case was a great choice.  It protects my kindle fire and is very functional.  It Works well when I just want to read books or if I'm using the Kindle where I have to use the keyboard!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Easy to play, hard to master. Enjoyable new concepts are thrown at you to keep it interesting. More levels please!
B002RKSXJG|5.0|Despite the length of this book, it holds my interest (and my husband's too!).  We have loved this old classic.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Bought this DVD and it kicks my booty! My roommate has started doing it too. We both are sweating only a few minutes in and panting. Jillian is not joking around, after a few workouts I ended up muting the talking and putting on music. If you have pets they might try to snuggle you during the 1 minute abs portion LOL
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a pretty good but it takes forever to unlock all the games and its a good way to pass time
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book continues the action packed drama of the first book that keeps you racing to turn the page to see what happens next.  All three books were excellent.

1612130283|3.0|This is what women want and it's obvious by the ratings.  This is the way it has been for centuries and anyone saying otherwise is in denial or too naive to realize it.  When I was using women, this is what they loved and I couldn't beat them away with a stick (actually some even encouraged that!)  Women want to change the bad boy but after they get knocked up and knocked around a little too many times, they realize that the nice guy is the one you marry that will take care of you and your brood. Child support anyone?  Good luck getting Mr. bad boy to pay or even finding him because he is living with another women who is loving every minute of it (thanks Loverboy).<br />  Guys, you want to understand women? Read this book.  Women, you want to know what you really want?  Read this book and give it to your boyfriends on fantasy night.  peace.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Very good cast, good backdrops, poor dialog delivery, poor story lines, moderate direction. Disappointed in this low budget, filmed in a weekend, delivery.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key was recommended to me by a friend. I downloaded the free sample on my Kindle, and immediately purchased the book on my Kindle. The story is a part of French and WWII history that I had little knowledge of, and made me want to research the round-up of French Jews on July 16, 1942, more deeply...The book was well written; the plot disturbing but important to read to the end. I liked the author's use of flashback and flashforward; literary techniques that are challenging to use well. The conclusion was disappointing, personally. I'm a retired educator. This is a book that I would use with a high school history class. De Rosnay's other titles are ones that I shall explore next. Well done!
B003RV43X4|1.0|A very poorly directed movie with a few moments of special effects. I expected much more from this movie than it delivered. Don't rent it or you will regret it.
B006QNDDHW|2.0|There's little science and a lot of art behind this book. If you are looking for objective, well-researched, evidence-based support for all the slide design tips, look elsewhere. To be fair there's a demonstrable need for a lot more science in slide design: choice of fonts, sizes, backgrounds, picture placement, points per slide, labelling, etc.
B004ZNAXX2|4.0|Yea there was no way I was going to pay over $100 without the full movie, audiophile formats or Blueray! Than after hearing how cheap the trinkets were, I was glad I didnt buy the physical CD set. But for much less the MP3 remastered version Of The Wall and the unreleased band demos and so on are very interesting!  Some of the demos are kinda rough but others are quite lovely and unique.  Some of it is even weirder and more out there than the finished product!  A much different less polished version of this album could have been released.  There's about 30 demos!  You could piece these tracks together and have a very unique and delightfully strange version of The Wall to listen to, you might have to add a few full tracks from the original.  That may not be your thing, but I really enjoyed a lot of them!  The original album remains one of the biggest rock masterpieces of all time!  You can buy the mp3 on Amazon, Itunes, etc.  If you can afford the extra money, buy the whole set.  It's just a question if you got the money to burn?  because when a  high resolution stereo version is released, you'll probably want that too!  Than more money out!  I still say these deluxe editions what really counts is the sound and the audio quality/remastering.  It's nice to have a good solid set with nice artwork and heavy duty CDs and sleeves.  But throwing in all these extras isnt worth it to double the price, or some cheap extra that doesnt improve on the sound or movie quality!  So I'm giving my 4 stars based on The Wall remastered version and the bonus tracks.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|okay so i just got the app and i was waiting for it to load so i can play it, it took 3 hours to load i got rid if the app because it SUCKS DONT GET IT!!!!!!! don't listen to the ppl who say it is gud because it isn't!!!!!!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed this novel. I've had a difficult time writing a review because, to me, this novel was more about the journey than the destination.<br /><br />I loved traveling with Shadow and meeting the fascinating array of interesting characters that populated his Hero's Journey. I wasn't certain where we were headed, and I didn't really care, because I was just having too much fun watching the action and listening to the stories.<br /><br />\\"How'd you lose your eye?\\" Wednesday shoveled half a dozen pieces of bacon into his mouth, chewed, wiped the fat from his lips with the back of his hand. \\"Didn't lose it,\\" he said. \\"I still know exactly where it is.\\"<br /><br />Traveling with Shadow was certainly enjoyable and there were plenty of laughs, but it wasn't all fun and games. Shadow learns a lot and makes some very insightful observations. The other mortals and gods he meets along his way also provide seeds of inspiration and contemplation:<br /><br />\\"There are stories that are true, in which each individual's tale is unique and tragic, and the worst of the tragedy is that we have heard it before, and we cannot allow ourselves to feel it too deeply.\\" .... \\"If it were to touch us it would cripple us or make saints of us; but, for the most part, it does not touch us. We cannot allow it to.\\"<br /><br />The gods even confide in Shadow:<br /><br />\\"Think of us as symbols - we're the dream that humanity creates to make sense of the shadows on the cave wall.\\"<br /><br />\\"And then one day they forget about you, and they don't believe in you, and they don't sacrifice, and they don't care, and the next thing you know you're running a three-card monte game on the corner of Broadway and Forty-third.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman weaves a magical tale filled with complex, likable characters who actually have plenty to say about the real world. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|icompleted. it in 2 months!  it was fun! it is great! (may never. be. complete) downloading takes a couple minutes : 5 stars _
0670877069|5.0|The Whole Story Books is a fantastic line of classic literature with various information in the margins that relates to the stories. In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|What a fantastic and enjoyable series. It is amazing that this didn't become a multi-season production. Complex characters, funny dialogue, really a lot of fun.
B006UG909U|4.0|As a fan of the Roth years of VH, I had a built-in curiosity of how this album would be, and more than a little inclination to believe it might be a train wreck (that album cover would've made it easy for a lot of critics to write bad reviews). After experiencing every fan's \\"uh-oh\\" at the lead single, \\"Tattoo,\\" I was won over by the teaser tracks VH put out on the web.<br />In short, if you like their first six albums, this is a 5-star collection. If you're a fan of hard rock, in general, this is a buy. Amazingly, this collection of songs from near-geriatric Van Halen stands with their best. There are no true clunkers (even \\"Tattoo\\" is catchy, if mediocre). Eddie's guitar is once again simultaneously acrobatic and melodic. DLR does not sound like he's 26, but he is in astoundingly good voice, and even manages a few banshee shrieks. Alex wails, and the NEW \\"fat guy from Van Halen\\" more than suffices as a bassman/back-up vocalist.<br />One caveat for casual listeners: this is not a pop album. In fact, this is probably the most hard, fast, and heavy rock album this band has ever done.<br />David Lee Roth, whatever his technical shortcomings as a singer (one cannot, however knock his range), seems to bring out the best in his band mates. He has also brought back the clever wit and showmanship that were sorely missing in the Sammy years.<br />Just like the album cover photo, VH are a relic from another age, but a streamlined and powerful relic that can knock you dead.<br />Here's hoping they have one more of these in 'em, before they pack it in or implode again.

B006ZJJ6XW|3.0|I received this new re-release this week from amazon (Sony RCA Masters). I'm encountering this set for the first time since high school. Back then I didn't find it that appealing, mainly because the Dyna-warp LP sound was pretty flat and diffuse, and it couldn't compete with the two cycles I had at home (my dad's copy of the Toscanini/NBC cycle and my copy of the Leibowitz/Royal Phil on Reader's Digest).<br /><br />The good news first: the discs sound great. Very clear with the hall captured magnificently. The entire cycle was recorded at Symphony Hall in Boston, though that venue credit appears only on CD 5 (the 9th). One can hear occasional traffic noise from the streets, a problem that afflicts many BSO recordings made in this period (this cycle was recorded between 1962-69). Recording dates appear on each disc. Still, the sound is pretty spectacular, even when it is compressed or distorted in the loudest spots. There's a bit of over-saturated distortion in the 5th and the 9th symphonies as well. Instruments come off realistically. The strings sound great. The winds are colorful and very prominent, and I mean, VERY prominent (which - being a former oboist - is fine with me).<br /><br />The Dynagroove LPs of these recordings were flat sounding (I can't vouch for how they sounded as \\"Living Stereo\\" releases). That has been corrected, and these CDs have a nice sense of front-to-back perspective, though you wouldn't mistake them for the best of digital recordings. The miking is close, but not right on top of things. I'd guess they had a number of ambient mics scattered about the hall.<br /><br />Whether due to Leinsdorf, the recording team or both, every strand of the orchestra is crystal clear, and not just that one can hear the double basses through the texture. One can actually hear the double basses' pitch through the texture. Overall, the orchestra really sounds great.<br /><br />That said, all of that clarity from Leinsdorf has the effect of every instrument and every note having the same weight and importance at any given time. It's like there are no secondary voices and no primary voices. They're all secondary voices and they're all primary voices. All the time. All at the same time. This robs the music making of much of its forward momentum. It's as if you're listening to the music vertically, rather than horizontally, if that makes any sense. One could take musical dictation from these recordings...if that's why one listens to recordings.<br /><br />The interpretations are straight (or objective. if you prefer) to a fault. Tempos are on the slow side - which I liked - but there's very little in the way of interpretation. Perhaps this is Leinsdorf playing \\"The Composer's Advocate,\\" attempting to let the composer speak for himself. Entirely for himself.<br /><br />The interpretive choices that are made are a bit strange. In the Fourth Symphony,  Leinsdorf moves the Allegro vivace at the double bar of the first movement forward to encompass the last 3 bars of the Adagio intro! If you know this symphony and know the first ending to this first movement, then imagine playing the last three bars of the Adagio the same way they are played when they reappear in the first ending, and you'll see what's going on here. It's not what Beethoven wrote, and it sounds wrong to my ears. This interpretive choice negates the stretto that Beethoven wrote as a transition from the Adagio of the intro into the Allegro vivace. The tempo should stay Adagio until the double bar. I've never heard the end of the Adagio played this way, and I don't think I need to hear it again. It's too clever by half, imagining one is making a \\"correction\\" to Beethoven's magnificent score when none is needed. Lest you think I'm picking on Leinsdorf here, I would mention that Carlos Kleiber takes the same liberty with this particular phrase in a video recording he made with the Concertgebouw (a recording I discovered after listening to this Leinsdorf set). That makes me think that this interpretive gesture isn't unique to Leinsdorf, but perhaps arises from some school of interpretation that's new to my ears. Whatever or whoever - I still don't care for it!<br /><br />The recording of the 5th suffers from really bad over saturation in the second and fourth movements whenever the recording gets loud. Leinsdorf plays the pizzicato grace notes in the first fiddles in the third movement, bars 300-310 as straight eighth notes, when they are clearly marked as acciaccatura. Don't know what that's all about, either. The Sixth features some lovely playing from the strings and a few over-done ritardandi that come as a shock when set against Leinsdorf's overall objectivity.<br /><br />The second movement of the 7th is played with the staccato marks taken way too literally, with the entire movement given a detached quality (again, it sounds like a vertical approach to the music) that trivializes things. The third movement is taken slower than we're used to these days. I liked the beginning, but when the movement gets to the big moment for the sustained trumpets, they announce their presence then slip back into the texture. It's pretty underwhelming, especially when compared to Karajan's approach, where the trumpets blaze forth in glory, crescendo-ing along the way. With Leinsdorf, we get to hear what the strings are doing from top to bottom, but the musical impetus is missing. I'd trade a world of textural clarity for drama and forward momentum every time in these phrases.<br /><br />The 8th is quite good. This is not an easy symphony to play, but it seems to fare well on recordings. I can't think of anyone who has really botched it. I'd say this is the highlight of the set, which isn't a bad thing as the 8th should occupy a higher place in the mindset of music lovers than it seems to these days. Frankly, I prefer the 8th to 9th these days, probably because the 9th is overplayed.<br /><br />In 9/i, Leinsdorf has the fiddles jump up an octave to double the flutes in their written range in numerous places, significantly, when heading back into the big D major statement just over halfway through the movement. In the Scherzo, I could swear I heard a trumpet doubling the horns, which themselves are re-scored to double the wind parts.<br /><br />I have to say that the chorus and the vocal quartet are damn fine in the 9th. Placido Domingo is VERY good here. It reminds me why I so dislike his later work - there was a point where he decided to go the Martinelli route and squeeze the bridge, probably so he could sing a greater variety of repertoire. Compare his singing here to what one hears on his typical opera recordings on DG that were made in later years and you'll see what I mean. He blew it.<br /><br />Symphonies 8 & 9 are the real keepers in this set. (I can see why BMG reissued the 9th a couple of years ago in their High-Performance series).<br /><br />As far as repeats go, Leinsdorf takes the first movement repeats in every Symphony except the Eroica. I haven't made mention of the Eroica or the first two symphonies yet. Symphonies 1 & 2 are very good. Leinsdorf's clarity and attention to detail pay big dividends in these classically oriented works. The Eroica just didn't make that much of an impression on me, and that alone speaks volumes.<br /><br />\\"24-bit high-resolution audio\\" proclaims the little black box on the back of the clam shell, so one assumes the entire set has been remastered.<br /><br />The new box is 1/2 inch wide, so it saves shelf space.<br /><br />I don't know that I would recommend this set to anybody but classical completists and those who love the sound of the BSO from this era. It's a good set for those who can't read music and who would like to hear everything on the page revealed in sound. But for those who demand passion and a point of view in their Beethoven, this set probably won't set the heart a-flutter. And, there are enough oddball interpretive choices made that I wonder how this set will fare on repeat hearings.<br /><br />Considering that BMG released this complete cycle on CD in their European Navigator series back in 1993 or so (and that that set wasn't available in the USA) and that it took them another 20 years to get around to a USA release, I'm guessing the decision makers at BMG didn't have much confidence in the sales potential of this set. Its release at this late date in the CD era - while welcome for the great playing of the BSO - says a lot about the merits and demerits of this Beethoven cycle (having said all of the above, this set is hard to resist when it's being priced at the ridiculously low price of $10-14 at amazon).<br /><br />I wanted to love this set. My overall reaction was one of disappointment. I guess I was hoping that these CDs would offer a corrective to my youthful evaluation, which wasn't very positive. That has certainly happened before with other recordings, but it didn't happen this time.<br /><br />C'est la vie.tave to double the flutes in their written range in numerous places, significantly, when heading back into the big D major statement just over halfway through the movement.
