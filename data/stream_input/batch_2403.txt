B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I ordered this for my almost 6 year old who loves the similar Nintendo game. It is great on my Kindle HD. I hope he likes it as much as I do. I have already gotten through the first three levels while be was sleeping - lol!

B00APUQRPC|3.0|I liked and enjoyed the movie, but isn't worth pay full price.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's performance was predictible, Justin Timberlake is in this for eye candy purposes,but Amy Adams' performance was wonderful.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|A big fan of Michael Buble<br />But there are some songs I wish he hadn't included orpicked a better duet partner to sing with.<br />Love his self written song \\"Close Your Eyes\\" it is so beautiful it has me crying. \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\" makes me smile !<br />Not to be missed his tribute to  Elvis & the standards.<br />Wonderful vocal range, tempo& feeling<br />I LOVE YOU MB<br />Buy this album!!!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I read this book and it was filled with intense action and had many mysteries crossing your mind.<br />There fore it's 5 stars
B008B68J2G|3.0|No surprises here. This set contains some fairly solid colorful pieces of plastic. The set adds minimal fun to my daughter's play. If I threw it out she may not even notice. You truly are paying for the Monster High name with this set, but if you/your child are really into Monster High and need some accessories then this one fits the requirement. There's nothing particularly wrong with this set and if I was going to buy any one this may be the one I would choose in this price range.
B008LG6SXS|1.0|I have installed the application on my Xperia ray and could never make use of it. The application consistently stops when the list of hotels is extracted
B00BZODDYU|4.0|It was scary, suspenseful and had you on edge wondering what was going to happen next. A must see movie...
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|As all the people who are upset for the single version edition for the 3D edition of this movie, i wait until the price falls to 20.99, like it is now but big was my surprise when I received this product without the slipcover. I´m very unhappy with this purchase.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This is one of those books that you really, really want to give 5 stars, but just can´t. The first book was amazing. The idea of a national contest to find a princess was a clever twist on the old Cinderella theme. I didn´t even mind the slight cliffhanger ending because it was actually a pretty logical stop point.<br /><br />My grouse with the second book is that it really is just fluff. I won´t do any spoilers like a couple of others, although the reviews were very well written, but it´s not rocket science to know, long before the first book ended, who America will chose, how the nation will change, etc, etc. The fun is in seeing how the author gets there. The second book was still a very good read, but I think it and the final (3rd book) could probably have been made into one. There are some good character developments, but they really don´t overcome a lot of overdone waffling (America), a dangling relative (letter from brother and then...nothing?), and a character who´s a bit too much of the evil competitor to be believable enough to justify her staying in the competition (Celeste).<br /><br />Even with all of the above, I still can´t wait for the final installment of this series. I hope the author doesn´t disappoint and brings her series back up to the excellence set by the first book.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Awesome. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. One of Tarantino's best movies thus far.
B005S9ELB2|3.0|It's a fun, innocent movie.  Not as good as 3, but OK.  Good for families, people with children.  Story could have used more work.
0375869026|5.0|Half way through this book but its excellent.  Really makes you think and is helping my preteen have a new perspective.
0553386697|5.0|As a new mom and therapist I felt compelled to write a review for this wonderfully written book.<br /><br />This book clearly explains how to teach your child empathy, how to process and move past distressing situations, and how to teach them to avoid \\"getting stuck\\" in repetitive counterproductive thought processes. All of that is in addition to teaching parents(in non clinical, everyday language that anyone can follow) how to be a better, more present parent.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book is that there are comic style drawings you can show to your child, when they're at the age to understand, to help further solidify what you are teaching them. Oh! and there is a handy reference section in the back of the book showing you what each skill looks like at every age.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved that book and would read read it over and over again. Beautiful creatures is a fantastic read for everyone.

B009EAO38C|4.0|I love the originality in the arrangements and interpretations of some recognizable tunes and some new ones too.  The Piano Guys are truly talented.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|When a show hinges on the feelings of the two leads for each other, and after two, three, or four seasons they fall into each other's arms declaring their love it means the end is near. Fortunately Castle has more going for it. The writing is very decent and the cast is excellent. This season the shows have been a bit up and down, all very watchable, but some better than others. Then suddenly three terrific episodes in a row: the two-part kidnapping episode followed by an episode with Ryan getting a chance to shine by going undercover as an Irish hoodlam followed by the fun take on Hitchcock's film Rear Window. The show continues to maintain the fun and quality that began in the first season. I find that most television shows have a life of three to five years before burn-out, this show has the potential to keep going. Makes me happy!
1401941893|1.0|Want to read 100 pages of a Victoria's Secret Super Model whining about poor self-esteem and \\"discovering\\" that she's as beautiful as she feels? Yeah, neither did I. Miranda Kerr talking about feeling unbeautiful is like Bill Gates kids writing a book on how to overcome growing up poor. Not only written by an author normal human beings can't possibly relate to, the book is pure fluff. In the first half of the book Miranda teaches you to love yourself, just like she did, with all of her \\"flaws\\". It must not have been that hard because she manages to do it in the space it would take to write a personal essay. Then the publisher enlarges the typeface and crunches it down to a 5 x 7 paper size so that it takes up more space. The entire second half of the book is Miranda's favorite, \\"affirmations\\", spaced one quote per page, just to make sure it looks like a tiny gift book when you buy it and not a brochure. Add a pretty pink cover, a dozen or so model shots of Miranda and lots of butterfly clip art and presto bango, you have yourself a self-help book.
B008EEBBIY|2.0|Got turned onto this band by the \\"Free singles from rising artists\\" feature on Amazon MP3 market.  Downloaded \\"Buried\\", liked it, listened to the sampling from the whole album and thought, \\"Interesting, I'll give them a try\\".  Big mistake.  This album is a snooze-fest, with only two tracks worth listening to: \\"Buried\\" (which I already had free), and \\"Hero\\".  Every song sounds the same - melodic, flowly lyrics with lots of vocal harmonies.  The aforementioned tracks are the only exception and not enough to carry the album.  I dunno, maybe I'm missing something, but I wish I had my $7.99 back to spend on more worthy bands...

B0060MYM3S|5.0|As a huge fan of the books I was skeptical about the series. That skepticism lead to my being pleasantly surprised by the devotion to the storyline and particularly the gritty, intense atmosphere. The thing I love about the books is also true of the series. The creators take the time to explore the political intrigue and character development in the books, where most would just do the easy thing and try to skip to the action.
B000SLP4SE|3.0|Able to keep my interests through out the movie but had those \\"I saw that coming\\" moments. Movie was overall entertaining but probably would watch it again.

B002VHI8FE|3.0|The book isn't a masterwork by any means. There are some aspects of his writing style that jolt me out of immersion. However the book is good gritty entertainment, the fantasy novel equivalent of one of those great b-movies where you aren't sure why you love it, but you do.

0312997221|4.0|Lately I have been discovering (for myself) Frederick Forsyth. So much of what he writes is simply amazing. If he would just stick to the plot I might like him better. Here we have several backstories to start the novel. They seem interminable, and, of course, we don't know where they will lead us. Not many are likely to go back to them after finishing the novel, but I do wonder how much of them were worth the time. Throughout the novel we stop for history lessons. Once done, the story gets moving, and it moves well, with excitement and tension. For me, the flaw is the super hero, a lawyer and Vietnam vet. What he accomplished is against odds that the author himself sets up. We are led to believe that his task is virtually hopeless. Yet like many novels where one man is set up against impossible odds, the reader has little doubt about how it will turn out. So it becomes a matter of how it is done. Forsyth went to great lengths to set up his story. He created the fancy estate where the fugitive lived, he created the impossible odds, and he created the hero who would go up against them. It's all cleverly done, but at the same time, a bit much.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This is possibly worth 4 stars if it had the same type of ads as every other game out there. However, the actual experience of Bag Piggies with ads is only 1 star and almost unplayable. I think Rovio is actually shooting themselves in the foot long term, even if short term revenue is up. The number and type of ads in this game sets a horrible precedent. On my kids Kindle Fire, there is a full page pop-up ad frequently throughout the gameplay, not just once in a while, like other games. Some ads are 30 second video full screen ads in the middle of gameplay -- a type I've never seen before. A few ads are ok, or constant small ads that don't continuously interrupt gameplay -- they've been tolerable in hundreds of games up until now. Sorry, but the amount, frequency and type in Bad Piggies is absolutely ridiculous!

I like the streamlined and sensible approach for busy MBA students. Thank you Akash!

B002YCVX5S|4.0|Overall a very good film. Christoph Waltz was by far the best actor and Brad Pitt got a criminally low amount of screen time. However, it felt like it was a half hour or so too long for me. Some of the scenes really dragged on, and having to read about half of the movie script in subtitles definitely didn't help. Overall, I'd watch it again, but I'd pick Django if I needed to watch some Tarantino.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|yes, we have come a ways, but not a long way in recognizing mental illness. I now need to rent the movie!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Excellent acting, writing and production. Fine ensemble cast. It's hard to believe this is only season 1! This has the feel of even a third season, even though the exposition is still continuing in spots. At the same time, even though it is a procedural, they are keeping it fresh. Not your mother's or father's Sherlock Holmes.

1580084621|5.0|As a person of Thai-descent, born and raised in America, I experienced a hybrid Thai culture in the home, as much as it is possible in suburban America. But I was never able to explain the subtleties of that culture to anyone in the way that David Thompson has distilled it down in this fantastic book. His knowledge of the history and various regions of Thailand is masterful and enlightening.<br /><br />I was delighted to find some of my favorite recipes from home were in this book, as my parents were never able to hand the recipes down to me. As a lifelong cook, my mother never followed a recipe or measured anything - so without her sense of how the food should be my cooking never quite rose up to her level.<br /><br />But look out now - these are incredible, authentic recipes that are not watered down in the least. This is the authoritative Thai cooking/culture/history lesson in a book, and if you're ready to learn the way, this is the path.
B00BOX0K0M|2.0|As a polarizer this filter does it's job. (In horizontal/landscape mode only). But it's all plastic and scratches VERY EASILY and with the extreme wide angle/huge depth-of-field of the GoPro these scratches will degrade the image. At very least it should come with cover/lens cap. i was very careful but nonetheless, on my second day of using it, a series of scratches mysteriously appeared; I will test, but I'm guessing it is now useless.

B007I2BZIE|2.0|This really hurts me to write. I've been a Rush fan since the 7th or 8th grade (1982/3). I have every album and DVD they've put out (well, almost; just found something I don't have and I'm buying it!) save some greatest hits which were unnecessary for me. I will be seeing them in two days in Fort Lauderdale for the Clockwork Angels tour (7th row; my thirteenth Rush show! Hope that doesn't portend anything horrible.) I've seriously tried to love these songs. I can't.<br /><br />Yes, different Rush fans will have their favorites and love various eras. I loved the first 10 albums almost equally, then Rush went into a lull period with Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, both of which have their moments but were overall lackluster to me. I loved the albums Counterparts and Vapor Trails, both of which married great lyrics and music, fused with ideas that appealed to me, such as Ghost Rider, Vapor Trails and Earthshine from the latter and Animate, Cut to the Chase, Stick It Out and Cold Fire from the former. I also was drawn to the albums Roll the Bones and Test For Echo (Driven is one of my favorite Rush songs.) But since Vapor Trails Rush has gone into another lull period for me. Snakes and Arrows was ok, very existential, but the marriage of music and lyrics didn't strike me as previous albums did. It's that intangible quality that we all seek, undefinable, a certain Rush quality; it was missing for me as if their power of song writing were fading again into dormancy. This album also lacked that quality, at least for me. Here's my take on it (out of four stars):<br /><br />The Garden - three stars<br />BU2B - three stars<br />The Anarchist - two and a half<br />Caravan - two and a half<br />Clockwork Angels - two and a half<br /><br />That's it. The rest are two at best, nothing inspiring; they do nothing for me, even after multiple listens. Most Rush albums that I love have at least half the album with three and four stars or with several four star songs that overwhelm the deficits of the rest (like Test For Echo with its title song and Driven). I bought expensive floor seats for this tour and I will go, of course (would never hear of missing a Rush tour!) But hearing this entire album isn't making me as excited as I once was when tour time came a calling. Maybe after hearing them performed live I will change my mind (that does happen, just not often.)<br /><br />Dormant their power may be, but I hold hope that it will awaken again in some future effort. As with all things art music is subjective. Maybe it will strike you. Just give it a listen first. Some of us are compelled to buy Rush albums, whether we really take to them or not! That's the mark of a true fan who still worships all things Rush.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|I'm sure it was the point of the movie, but what a cast of pathetic, hopeless characters.  Nothing ever redeems anyone and there are no good outcomes.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Carry your reader with you or read it from your desktop.  It is amazing that a Kindle reader can be replaced with a Windows PC, or tablet or smart-phone. Or if you have an Android smart-phone - that will work just as well, as will your Android tablet. Say you have  an older Linux system, you will get good results from that also. The nice thing for Amazon is they sell e-books, making this a win-win situation.
0385341008|5.0|\\"Guernsey Literary ...\\" was chosen as my book club read this month.  What a wonderful read it was!  The format of the novel is letters written between Juliet and  her editor, friend, suitor, and most importantly the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society.  The history of the Channel Islands being occupied by the Germans during WWII was informative and told in a way that humanized the German occupation.  What was so impressive about the author was her ability to mix humor and the horrors of war in the same book and sometimes even in the same letter. This is an easy, informative, and fast read--- utterly delightful.

B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I have found a new favorite in Colum McCann.<br />Reading this wonderful novel, which at first appears to be a series of unrelated short stories, was an experience of one highlighter moment after another.  I teach literature at a two-year college, and this will certainly make its way onto my syllabus the next time I teach introduction to the novel.  It toys with the possibilities of the novel and the possibilities of life; this work will stay with me.

B007REV4T8|5.0|In my opinion,probably 1 of the best,if not the best Bond movie ever.I've seen them all in the theater,from Dr No to this one.Although Sean Connery is still the ultimate Bond,Daniel Craig is a very close second,Would have liked to see Connery in this movie as the younger actor that he was.

B004478AS4|4.0|This book manifested, in short form, the beginnings of colonization.  Achebe cleverly weaves an interesting story about 100 (and more) year old customs and traditions that were infiltrated and invalidated by the 'white man'. This story is a good depiction of how so called 'Christianity' is used to disguise the real motives of the colonizers - money and control.

B003O86FMW|4.0|[...]<br /><br />You're not going to find many books that push the content of teenage literature quite like The Hunger Games.  The first book by Suzanne Collins spared little when it came to visceral detail, and even less when taking the themes and commentary into account.  It's for these reasons that more and more readers head into Catching Fire wondering just how much higher the ante will be raised.<br /><br />Taking place a few months after the first book, Catching Fire is quick to make the impact of its predecessor clear.  To the common Capitol folk, Katniss and Peeta are pretty high on the heels of royalty, especially given their coal-mining District.  To many of the people who truly matter, however, it's only the next step up a grizzly ladder.  Giving away even a few of the opening details simply feels wrong, as one thing Suzanne Collins has an uncanny ability to do is keep you guessing.  Very passionately, I might add.  Many of the endings to the chapters will boil the willpower of readers aplenty, letting up only when they turn the page once again.<br /><br />Where The Hunger Games often brought most of its tension with Katniss' own life, Catching Fire sees those closest to her become the subjects of concern.  And even with a relatively short list, there's still plenty to go around.  Combining this with the first-person point of view makes for a continually gripping and sometimes emotional read.<br /><br />While we're dealing with a full-fledged sequel, a lot of familiar territory is covered here.  A good chunk of the first half is in the same setting, while the area of choice for the final act isn't exactly fresh.  Most of the completely new material we get comes from the newly introduced characters.  Of them, previous Hunger Games Victor Finnick Odair is the only one who really stands out, and he only comes into play later on.  The rest of the new faces hardly even seem to have that going for them.  Not much time is set aside for many of who we're just now getting to know, and even the ones who play a larger part oftentimes get lost in a field full of odd, already-confusing names.<br /><br />Once again, Suzanne Collins shows a writing style of brevity, which both fits and hinders this particular installment.  Many (young) readers will only stomach so much detail, so keeping this quick and to-the-point is only understandable.  Not to mention the fact any time the stakes are raised, the rate of reading should remain elevated.  That said, a lot of points just feel too skimmed over; I kept hoping to see even a paragraph or two more to truly emphasize the impact of certain points.  This is all the more reason many of the supporting characters don't even come across as grounded.  They play as much a part as extras and props do in a film--their appearance is more important than their presence.<br /><br />When it comes to the key players, however, Catching Fire seldom slips up.  The territory is familiar, but the ongoings become increasingly hard-hitting.  Oftentimes the most impactful moments are the ones we don't see, or are merely left to speculate on.  As such, the end of the book will leave you with that exact feeling of head-clamping disbelief, hungry for even more.getting to know, and even the ones who play a larger part oftentimes get lost in a field full of odd, already-confusing names.<br /><br />Once again, Suzanne Collins shows a writing style of brevity, which both fits and hinders this particular installment.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After reading book 1 and 2 i had to find out how the trilogy ended.  although book 1 and 2 were staged in fantasy land, book 3 took on the tone of sci-fi.  It totally took off in strage directions both with the plot, characters and setting.  I read all types of books but I have to say that I felt lost at times in Mockinjay.  There were scenes that I had to re-read in order to make sense of them and I found myself going back to try to re-trace the origins of significant references.  The last third of the book was confusing and quite a disapointment.
B008JFUO36|3.0|[...]    The fact 2012 has passed is clearly of no concern to Hollywood.  An incoming assault of end-of-the-world and post-apocalyptic pictures is nigh, with After Earth, Pacific Rim, World War Z and This Is the End keeping Earth in plenty of jeopardy.  The first one up?  Summertime precursor Oblivion.  Set roughly a half-century into the future, the movie serves up as many immaculate shots as it does derivations from previous science fiction works.    Pitching Oblivion's premise doesn't necessarily make it sound like a riveting experience; Tom Cruise leads a small cast of relatively small players (aside from one Morgan Freeman) as Jack Harper.  His task is to repair drones which have been taken down and left by beings known as Scavs.  Truth be told, it takes a while to reach the movie's meat, and even longer to find its funky bones.  Before and in-between those points are a few stretches that could've easily been tightened for a bit less seat-shifting.  Twists and turns, especially of the unpredictable kind, are seldom and infrequent.    One thing Oblivion does accomplish  well is a certain level of intrigue, namely after the first hour.  A certain twist happens that, if unsurprising, still opens up a few questions the movie assumes we've already pondered.  As the final act starts to close, a sense of eminence comes forward which, if nothing else, holds our undivided attention.  Concern arises not so much with the convenient ending, but the payoff stemming from the climax.  Backing details are both sparse and vague, further reinforced by a brief but jarring shift in setting.    Looking past the story isn't too difficult, since there are several spectacular sights to behold.  If you've ever wondered what Earth would look like after every single disaster movie, Oblivion is here to fill (or show) the gaps.  Since many of these come during the first act, it means the feathery stakes can rest easy for a short while.  Even when the eye candy changes to slightly more action-packed moments, we still get to enjoy concise directing.  You won't feel the raised stakes so much as witness them, but at least the ongoings are discernible.    As our key tour guide, Tom Cruise delivers another solid performance.  Most of the time, the entire movie falls on his shoulders.  Thankfully, he's versed and competent enough to handle this without stumbling or overreaching.  And since this is Mr. Cruise, it just wouldn't look right for him to not have at least one attractive lady beside him.  In the case of Andrea Riseborough, we have a better take on what would normally be a simple caricature.  Some of her emoting feels unnatural, but the unease her character goes through is pleasantly convincing.  This is more than what can be said for Olga Kurylenko who, though not bad, doesn't have enough material to work with.  Most of her scenes seem forced in.  As for Morgan Freeman, who comes in rather late, he really doesn't have to act to convince the average audience member.  That said, he works out just a bit more than the character would if portrayed by anyone else.    Other than the visual quality, what will probably stand out to film enthusiasts is just how much Oblivion borrows from other sci-fi movies.  2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Independence Day and even Armageddon merely lead an all-too-obvious list.  Thankfully, while Oblivion can't stand half as high as some, it does exceed the lesser works.    While the true juggernauts of 2013 still haven't been released, Oblivion isn't necessarily a minuscule player.  Those who have yet to verse themselves with most fundamental sci-fi films might walk away feeling floored.  Other, more acquainted viewers will want to see this as a homage to its forefathers, which is touched upon at certain points.  Keep your expectations modest and the end results might be enough for you to afford it a recommendation.

0812993845|4.0|Wedding Night is a cute fun story about two sisters, Lottie and Fliss, and their hilarious ride toward love. The story mainly focuses on Lottie's love life (and all the complications that come with it) but it does touch on Fliss's as well. Her story was left a bit unfinished so I am hoping there will be a follow-up coming (hint, hint Sophie Kinsella!). This novel is filled with what I love about Sophie Kinsella books: quirky and naive characters, heartwarming story lines, and love of all kinds (friendship, sisterly, and romantic). If you are a fan of Sophie Kinsella you will not be disappointed with Wedding Night. It is the perfect beach read!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books and since this is a trilogy of course had to read this, the 3rd and final book.<br />It was dark, rambling and annoying. By the end I was ready to kill Katniss myself just to have it finished.<br />I wish the author would have written this book with the same passion and rhythm as 1 & 2.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|Finally!!!  I've been waiting for this for a long time now. Definitely up to snuff and its incredibly fun.  Cant believe it was only 99 cents its a fantastic buy.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|amazing movie, highly recommend this movie, what a tear jerker, and a great movie, Sandra bullock, amazing, a movie to watch over and over
B0094K1QR8|3.0|Ashton Kutcher is not really the best of actors - but I love Natalie Portman.  It was good light-hearted rom-com.  Its got its funny moments.  Although Ashton Kutcher's friends in the movie were totally wasted.  I would have liked to see more from the two of them.  Same with the actors that were Natalie Portman (including Mindy Kaling - totally wasted in this movie).
B00003CX6P|5.0|love all 3 stars in this movie, damon does a GREAT job in the movie, had been searching for a while for this, at a reasonable price

B0012QRPU4|5.0|The show is awesome.  there are no words to explain how excellent the series is. It so the plague of the underpaid teachers and the government republican cuts to education.  That make teachers work 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet. God forbid you get sick on a teachers salary.  It is deffenatally worth watch, even if it is about meth.  Give it a chance, and enjoy.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|The tone of this novel is so heartbreaking and haunting that I felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest. I felt the emotions of Clay as he struggled through Hannah's life story and the effect that it must have had. This book was life changing. Highly recommended to high school students who don't necessarily see how a single action can effect the population around them.
B00CATSONE|5.0|particularly liked the part where tesla was explaining to financier j p morgan about a plan the inventor had which would allow anyone to obtain electricity just by sinking some wires into the ground.  morgan's only question was, where do you put the meter?
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|very moving and thought provoking in such an overwhelming circumstance...  the kindness of others can make such an impact on people... and how unimportant those worldly &#34;things&#34; we cling to are when you consider those folks lost famlies and loved ones ..<br />Scary that there is no advanced warning for horrific natural disasters as this was...So sad for all those lost souls.....and those left behind to grieve...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This the second time I have read this.It was a hard go around<br />This time because of what happened in Boston. I<br /> Know the author had a reason for writing this book., but the violence was hard to take because of listening to the news out of Boston while I was reading it.
B000U20AAS|5.0|Yet the writing is so full that we can feel part of this other world.<br /><br />I came to this story by the back door. My first introduction to Somerset Maugham was through the movie \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1946) staring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. I have no idea as to how much it was adapted from the book. Then in 1984 we watched Bill Murray as Larry Darrell. This film lost what magic the 1946 film had. So it was time to read the book. Yes I know very few films can do more than present the essence of a book. Turns out that even the older film wrote Summerset out of some of the scenes.<br /><br />Larry is back from the war (WWI). As with many of us he is left with nagging questions about why one person lives and another must die. This problem leads Larry to search for the answers. He turns down opportunities and takes up a lifestyle to help him find answers.  This story is told or narrated by Somerset Maugham himself. In the book Somerset takes more of an active part in the story. Larry came as close as any of us to the answer, he seeks and we leave him much the same way one enters and leaves your life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0007PALVQ The Razor's Edge]]<br />[[ASIN:6303333079 Razor's Edge [VHS]]]

You need at least three players to make this fun because you are guessing who has the princess card (among others) and if you only have two players, it's too easy. It takes about 15-20 minutes to play one round and turns go by quite fast. Whoever wins the princess's affection gets a wooden cube. You can extend the game as much as you want by seeing who can win the most number of wooden affection cubes over however many rounds you want to play. The art on the cards is nice, but the cards themselves are a bit flimsy, so you should probably sleeve them. The generic backstory is typical dumb romance novel nonsense, and the fictional fantasy kingdom setting did nothing for me. Would have preferred a historical setting. Also, most dudes I know would not, if asked, want to play a game called Love Letter, so a different concept like rooting out traitors to the crown for the king's honor would have been a more marketable concept to reach a wider male audience. I didn't love this game and don't care to own it, but would play it again if asked. I give it 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Not counting the awesome [[ASIN:B001JQY6K4 Dominion]] (because it takes an hour to play), my favorite quick card game is [[ASIN:0786949953 Guillotine]].
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read this book for my book club and I can't wait to discuss it!<br /><br />Very well written, good story line, good character development. Overall a great read.
0316010669|5.0|A new thought for me, and excellent business models were included as examples. I was hoping for a chapter with personal relationship examples.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|transcends the genre; this is simply the greatest, most introspective, most intellectually stimulating book I've read!<br /><br />NOTE: upon consuming &#34;Dune&#34;, the david lynch movie will suddenly become awesome to you.  if you watch the movie without reading the book, it will be a confusing, baffling ordeal
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One has been on my \\"to-read\\" list for awhile. Why did I wait so long to read this book? I'm totally convinced that Ernest Cline wrote Ready Player One for me specifically because it had everything I love in a book. Basically Ready Player One was the perfect book for me.<br /><br />  You can't call yourself nerdy unless you've read Ready Player One because this book is a nerd's heaven. I loved all of the video game, and 80's movie references that Cline included in this book. Even though I wasn't alive during the 80's, I still really appreciated the pop culture references included in this book. This book brought back so many fond memories from my childhood.<br /><br />  Cline created such a vivid and spectacular world that I could easily picture.  Though this book was sci-fi, I feel like the events in this book could happen. The world has made so many advances, it would surprise me if something like OASIS was invented. I would love to use the OASIS in moderation, I fear that I would become addicted to the OASIS. It probably would be better if OASIS was never invented because people would lose sense of reality.<br /><br />  Ready Player One is an extremely entertaining and fun book. I know that this book has been optioned to become a movie and that is terrific news. Warner Brothers better not mess this movie up, seriously this movie needs to be true to the book. It's definitely going to be hard to squeeze all of the plot elements into a movie but I have faith that the movie will turn out spectacular.<br /><br />  Ready Player One is by far one of the best dystopian books I've ever. This book was unlike anything I've ever read before. I can't wait to read Armada, the movie rights have been already sold to Universal Pictures. I can't recommend Ready Player One enough!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Great writing. Easy read that is not just about trying to loose weight, but for people that want to live long healthy lives. Look forward to reaping the benefits. Thanks!

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game blew my mind its fun good graphics and nice cut scenes gameloft is just getting better and better
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Bought it for my new Kindle Fire HD because it was only sale for $20 at the time. Perfect fit. Absolutely love it. A+
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put this book down. Finished it in one sitting. The book was riviting during the read wanting get to the end
630542845X|5.0|love this old school movie of a out cast. like they say never judge a book by it's cover. all he wanted was to be left alone seem like he can't get his wish until the end.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is shocking and totally riveting at the same time. There was one uncalled for sex scene but I suppose that was to tell you how low one can sink trying to recover that first high. Ellen Burstyn was magnificent as Sophie This is the kind of movie that you will think about long after it is over..
B00B1MHA18|5.0|A new classics to the Anerican blues collection. A must have for any Haper fan, Musslewhite aficionado, or regular blues lover. Instant Classic!
B008G12ERC|4.0|I probably should have bought the single song online instead of the whole Album. Im not as interested in their other songs as I thought I would be.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Kinsella's books I have read and this is no exception. Cute love story around the text messaging, phone attached reality of the modern girl. Characters are very interesting and the story was cute and not completely predictable from the beginning. Great fun read.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|this app is great for checking your steam account and sending messages to your steam freinds on the go (something i use frequently) one downside though is that you cant see groups, or manage groups if you own one. in my opinion this app really should come with these features it a great app outside of that
6301792734|5.0|I didn't know what to expect buying used VHS tapes, but these are almost in mint condition. One note- one of the individual covers was a little torn. I can't even care. The tapes run great and the movies are pre-Lucas's ridiculous remastering. I can finally see Greedo shoot first.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|If you were a fan of the book The Hobbit then this is not the movie for you. As the beginning episode to an extended LOTR series then it is but ok. In short it falls way short of the extreme care used in producing that amazing trilogy.<br />You will probably remember hearing throughout the specials associated with the LOTR series EVERYONE saying how much they respected the books and the author and made every effort to conform their product to that high standard. Well the people rapidly interviewed for the \\"Features\\" disc of this piece do not even mention either the book or the author-with good reason. Actually the features portion does not even begin to measure up to the materials carried in the commentaries and extras associated with the LOTR series. Those were an exercise and primer in film making and very interesting and informative.<br /><br />The features associated with this effort are no more than the usual fluff one finds associated with other \\"extras\\" discs with any DVD. In addition one is conducted through them at breakneck speed. Were the guides late for lunch or some such thing?<br /><br />It is a shame that the screen writers and director did not continue the superior bit which is contained in this show throughout the production. That is the scenes between Gollum and Bilbo are superb! A truly first rate job by both actors and their support crews behind the scenes. All the other stuff seems to boil down to marathon run through a gazillion Orcs by a bunch of overgrown clowns disguised as dwarfs-poor script writing indeed.<br />Jackson is quoted as saying he didn't want to do this piece initially. He should have stuck with his first impression. What good are 3D and 48fps if the basic product is low grade. Those bells and whistles are not sufficient to make a bad product acceptable.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Matilda was given the gift that so many children have expressed when something bad happens to them.&#34;I wish I could....&#34;.  Along with a high intelligence, she also had a wonderful sense of creative fun. The other children were not frighten by what she was doing as they probably were to happy to see the 'wicked witch' get her come-upance,  Matilda's family were quite unaware and even doubting  of her gift even when she gave her father the numbers he was asking for.  Being prepared to be adopted by the teacher, was a little far reaching, however, she had already figured out they would have to move and she had no intention, it at all possible of going with them. Happy endings are always good.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|My kindle fire will not charge.  They were kind enough to send this to see if it was the charger but it does not work.  I PURCHASED MY KINDLE FROM WALMART WITH A 24 hour replacement plan that is not worth the paper it is written on.  I have loved my Kindle...so disappointed that it does not work like it should.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I have read all the books that feature both Fitz and the Fool. Many times the story waned, but this has proven to be a deeply satisfying conclusion to an immersive fantasy. I feel more a witness to a fantastic adventure than a loyal reader, and am very happy that I ever decided to pick up that first book with the very dated illustration on the cover.
B00881PTRC|1.0|I'm reasonably smart but had to look up the first 3 animals names.  Never heard of them then realized their using sub set names.  You may know what a sparrow is but do you know the names of the dozens sub sets are. Deleted this real quick.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I have been a fan of the 4 seasons for years. It was great hearing the old songs again and again!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Love this book - the last in the series! So exciting and easy to read!  Need a truly smoothly written book. - this is it!
1451629192|5.0|She tells her story in childlike innocence just the way it was. I appreciate her candor and honesty and find it extremely inspirational.
B005LJITS0|3.0|The movie was ok - I liked the premise & the translations from the comic book were neat. The romance between the Lantern and the female pilot was nice chemistry. The issues seemed to be soundtrack either whispering or shouting. Not best application for mobile apps.
B007NZQU72|2.0|Too much into psychotherapy.  Almost makes one feel an HSP does have something wrong. Would not reread it like I did \\"Quiet.\\"
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie McGuire out did herself!! Beautiful disaster was amazing. Travis and Abby relationship has many ups and downs. I love the meaning behind pigeon. I think it is so sweet!! Loved this book!!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The book was not what I expected but I was intrigued and could not put it down.  A wonderful fantasy trip that I hope will continue.

B00BETX5PS|5.0|First 007 movie i have seen and i was not disappointed with the story or the actors. My husband and children loved it too.
0425252868|5.0|Certainly I really can't add much more than was has already been said about this excellent work. If you're reading this review, then you already know the premise of the book.<br /><br />Partway in, I was reminded of the movie Das Boot, which I need to watch again. Reading about Mr. Stigler and his associates reminded me once again that we tend to forget about the ordinary guys just trying to do their job. In Das Boot, it is the submariners, in this book, it is the pilots. It is so easy to succumb to the stereotype of the German military man being a brutal stormtrooper, and certainly some of them were. But the rest were fighting to save their country, not necessarily to save their government.<br /><br />I did find one extremely small mistake which has no impact on the story itself, and have been in contact with the author about it for future editions.<br /><br />I also need to point out the general construction of the book. The photographs were of excellent quality, and something I don't see very often is they followed the chronology of the book. Very easy to keep track of the minor characters throughout the book.<br /><br />I usually treat books of this type in one of two ways: either they go on the shelf to be shared with friends who have similar interests, or in the pile to go to the used bookstore. This one has caused the creation of a third category- urging my wife to submit it to her book club for their monthly selection.
B00BMCLCG6|2.0|I grew up listening to Bon Jovi. They have a good sound, and they know how to put on a good concert. Unfortunately the type of music on this new CD doesn't do it for me. I lean towards wanting rockin' songs versus calm and slow. This CD has an ok mix. We only got it because it was $5 for a while. I think this group has had better albums. Then again, it is all a matter of personal taste in music.
B00170I7GG|5.0|This movie while entertaining provides a wonderful context for your every day life. Consider how you would do things differently if provided the chance.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Again, the character I love John Corey, but this particular story left me annoyed.  I hate to say it, but it's as though the author couldn't be bothered in the end.  Almost seemed to me as though in this book  Nelson DeMille 'jumped the shark'..  It's ok, we all have off days, but this was one very LONG off day.  Had I not invested so much time with the other books in the series, I would have tossed this one a long time ago, but I forced myself in the end, and it was not worth it, in my opinion.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|My first experience with Plants vs. Zombies was from the Apple iTunes Store. I downloaded it, played it, and loved it. So when I purchased this game from the Amazon App Store, I was ready to play it on my Android mobile device. But what I didn't expect was that this version demands that you are running the Amazon App Store app before you can play the game; a game I already purchased. What?!<br /><br />Easy solution, I deleted the game and repurchased Plants vs. Zombies from the Google Play Store where there is no such restriction in running another app. Did I lose 99 cents by buying it again? Not really, I see it as gaining my freedom from the Amazon App Store. In saying this Amazon does a fantastic job in regards to customer service, but in this instance it unfortunately has failed.<br /><br />As a result of this incident, I have also deleted the Amazon App Store app from my device. If users can't run their games without being tethered to Amazon, I don't want any part of it.<br /><br />Uninstalled: Amazon App Store app and Plants vs. Zombies<br />Reinstalled: Plants vs Zombies from Google Play Store<br />Conclusion:  Happy, happy, happy<br /><br />Score-- Gamer:1  Amazon App Store:0
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|Easy read, engaging, low key, holiday read. Taught me a bit about war time Guernsey. About real people, easy to relate to.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Freezes up all the time. Goes too fast. Some times will shut off in the middle of a game but they are good about refunding credits when happens! Just wish didn't happen so much!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it. I read it in one day. It is even better than the movie. Everyone should read this book.
0470876417|5.0|Buy this book if you have ever considered getting to know how future business will be managed. All MBAs and business leaders should have it on their professional books shelf. Buy it and enjoy it!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Time is precious. I couldn't put this book down once I started reading. It teaches a valuable lesson about time, the things we hold dear and often take for granted. Life is for living and not worrying about every moment. It is only natural that we all run out of time. Let's not worry about gaining more time or reducing our time because the next moment can be the most wonderful moment. Don't attach yourself to a moment either because nothing is permanent. Things and feelings are always changing.<br /><br />Although a tad bit predictable in the story of Sarah because it can happen to any young girl..both Sarah and Victor have moving stories. I will definitely not take this thing called time or my life for granted.<br /><br />I had never read this author before but I will definitely be looking for more.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A satisfying read for both the scientifically oriented person and those of us who aren't. I had previously read heaven Really Does Exist book about the young boy's experience, and this one is a companion piece written by a brain surgeon. Both made me feel good about the beliefs I have always held. Don't miss it!
B005CVWWJY|3.0|Only if you really like video games and lots of 80's references.<br /><br />More filler text to meet requirement. Ah yes.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game lots of fun. The more time you spend playing the faster you will progress through the game. Lots of fun
015206057X|5.0|granddaughter like the book and she likes for me to read the book everyday. also she like to look at the wonderful pictures.
0316098515|5.0|This is an exquisite book.  The recipes and the photography are outstanding.  These are not recipes for the faint of heart, as most home cook will find them complex.  On the other hand, the results of few recipes I made are over the top.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars - and you'll eat like a top rated restaurant guest in your own home.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|love to play the game.it gives me a challenge to used the birds to get the monkeys and to go to different levels.
B0093URN4E|4.0|It's Converge, people. It doesn't get much harder than this unless you go to Germany and explore their metal scene. Difference is Converge is accessible, believe it or not. Sure you can't understand one word Jacob Bannon is screaming but that's what liner notes are for. I kid with the German metal. I only mean it's simply really, really aggressive and loud. Again, though, read the liner notes. Not being able to understand lyrics encourages the listener to actually read the chorus verse chorus and that's what separates Converge from their peers - the quality of their lyrics, musicianship and dedicated innovation. To me, on a basic kick-ass level, Converge wears the crown. Look into Dillenger Escape Plan if you dig this and if you need to hear the lyrics more clearly I am thrilled to direct you to one of my favorite bands HELMET. Still, though, Converge have 'cornered the market' along with D.E.P. with their gorgeously aggressive and truly unique and hardcore sound. I suggest buying not only this album but any Converge album especially Jane Doe. Enjoying being force-fed the noise.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love to play the game and having the challenge to hit the monkeys with the birds. the gret thing is going to different levels.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I like the cable and the initiative. Finally one of the missing components of the Samsung Nexus 10 that should have been available from day one.  Connects well to the the tablet with magnetic connector. The quality of the cable is good soft and easy to put away.<br />thanks!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love to play  and having the challenge to hit the monkeys with the birds. the great thing is going to different levels.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Great action and great actors.  I liked the story line as it was very realistic.  I have watched it several times over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So addicting!!! I've spent hours playing this game I can't even help it!!!  During about the challenges and funding it just how long you Jan keep up perfection.
B005R2N20Q|5.0|I never tire of listening to this CD - it is by far one of the most pleasurable I've purchased in recent years.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|Steinbeck makes the characters and sociological events of the dust bowl come alive. The reader feels the love, pain, and suffering of this time in America.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I enjoyed every moment and it particularly was enjoyable because of all the classic game characters it included.  Very creative with the great Disney quality one would expect.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I enjoyed being able to watch a classic childhood favorite, that I realize is a high demand program, without having to pay a fee. There are many programs and movies that I would like the able to view without having to pay extra. The prime membership is a bonus and great plus.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Just got it today and installed it a few minutes ago. Installing was a little challenging, but one i got set right in the printer's DIMM o on the right side, and powered it on.. it did a slower boot than normal with a status bar going across the bottom. After it was powered up, I printed a configuration page. The new module was noted in DIMM Slot 1 on the configuration page and the Memory went from 192MB to 488MBs with 289.83 MBs free. Thank you Amazon!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It works fine on my kindle fire. The image and text provide all of the information that I need to keep it powered up.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Wonderfully exciting game.  Create more, more, more of these games!!!  Looking forward to a sequels of<br />this game. I recommend this game very highly.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very fun game kind of like Dragon vale but there are many different types of dragons like the magic dragon.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I purchased this bag recently and even though it looks pretty small, it can accomodate a reasonable amount of stuff apart from my camera, three lenses, a flash, charger and some filters I carry around. I tried hanging my tripod at the side but it kinda tipped over the bag a bit and it looked like it could rip the side seams of the tripod holder so I didn't try it again. So overall it's a good backpack for a camera and some lenses but might not be the best choice to attach a tripod to.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I could watch in again and again.  I liked everything as I am a senior citizen and can relate.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game could be better if they add more things like increase speed or different elements that could give you more points
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My husband and i love to watch this show. We can't wait to catch up on season four! Please make it available on prime instant video!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Omg this was just as captivating, the first one.... very excited to read book three, The One!!! I read this in a sporadic 12 hours.... it went by so fast that I was almost unsatisfied with it.... I wanted more, although I'm team Aspen, I was happy with how it ended. ( minus the fact I could have used a few more chapters) I hope book three is due something this year!! (Fingers crossed)
0765325950|5.0|My husband loves Robert Jordan! Has read all his books in &#34;wheel of time&#34; series. He enjoyed this book as well. He thought Sanderson dig a good job.
1934030198|5.0|I highly recommend this product to anyone who is serious about training for Triathlon's. It requires some serious effort on ones part to understand the concepts of training and to plan. If you dont have the time or the patience I would just pay the money to a coach. But if you are serious this is the only book that you need to invest in apart from a decent bike, and running shoes. Good luck.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Yes, she has advantages that others do not.  But that only makes the fact that she took the risk and the time to focus on the success of the next generation of women more commendable.  We complain that there are no role models.  Here is one!  Let's embrace her!
B005TVYVI2|5.0|I owned this trainer for 3 months and I swim 3 times a week at a university pool and this just works perfect. It floats in the water so you will never lose it. Excellent product.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Great sci fi movie with many still relevant issues. Other than the transportation devise at the end of the movie, this was a believable movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Great, witty prose.  A few quirky/odd moments and characters which take me down to 4 stars rather than 5.  Very sad.
B000SEKNUK|4.0|This book is great!<br />I would recommend for personal or professional learning and development.<br />At times it does get dense in concepts so can take a bit to absorb but all WELL worth it!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|It started off very slow and didn't gain any momentum at all.  It was very predictable, no surprises.  There were a few good scenes ut nothing to write home about.
B005FFW46S|3.0|I have all ready reviewed it. It is not up to the standard of the author's previous efforts, Discworld quality is gone.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I LOVE Depeche Mode!  This one sounded a little disappointing at first and there are still some songs I'm getting used to but still, it's Depeche Mode...what's not to love.  They can do no wrong.  Another classic DM CD for my collection.  Hail to Martin Gore!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Sometimes you get that feeling that maybe batman was a bit too nice in these nolan films that maybe he was too emotional for someone with such a tragic back round. In this 2 part movie that changes and batman is what he should be a sullen, angry, brooding individual who wages a true WAR on crime as he encounters the joker for one last time. The joker is vastly different from any other time you've seen him, his voice is a new direction and his outward appearance is much more subtle than any other although his psychotic nature is seen with ALMOST no restraint as he seems even more serial killer like than the 2008 Dark Knight take (and i do stress the &#34;killer&#34; part). Batman matches that with brutality almost never seen from him both towards the joker and the war against the police who are after batman the entire time. The rest of the movie deals with political struggle during the cold war nightmare scenario which pits the eager to serve Superman against the renegade Batman in a battle to try and prove whos philosophy wins out at the end of the day
B00B3MN65K|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  The more I listen to it the better I like it.  Josh has such a rich voice.  All of the songs showcase his smooth one of  a kind voice and style.  Love, Love
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It's a great flashlight, nightlight (for when I have my nephew), and perfect for looking at pretty colors all you ADHD people!
B0089AF2DS|5.0|After seeing them live I appreciate their musical style even more. In keeping up with their previous albums, this album did not disappoint. Their melodic styles mixed with heavy yet precise playing completes this well rounded album.
B006LSZECO|1.0|the book was a good read overall. It had a slow beginning but once you got into it it was a REALLY great read even though some parts were un believable but that ending ruined the whole entire book for me. It's like the author just decided to stop writing. Did she get bored or something.. It's like the consequence was that they had to deal with each other but there wasn't even an epilogue.. I saw this book EVERYWHERE and read it with out reading the reviews.. I was engulfed in the book until the ending an then i got to the end and disappointment isn't even the word. I was yelling aloud when I got to the end I was so upset and distraught about it.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Gave this as a present to my wife and she loved it!<br />I highly recommend it to any males out there looking to surprise their loved ones!!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I had to buy this because my original cord stopped working. I was using my original cord with other non kindle devices and I think thats why it stopped working so now I use it specifically for my kindle fire. I DON'T like that the adapter is sold separately and theres no kind of bundle package to buy these to pieces to charge your kindle.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My 19 y/o daughter requested this cd for her birthday after seeing the Movie.  She enjoys it very much and I have become a fast fan as well.<br />The cd arrived in perfect brand new shape.<br />I would definitely order from this company again.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Never knew of this series. Happened upon it and it has had me glued to the TV. Fast paced new each episode but with a continuous story line as well. Wish I had more time to just watch all the series straight thu. First 3 seasons are available as amazon prime which is a good thing as well.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Classic tongue-in-cheek, over the top space adventure!  What really makes this work is the ensemble cast of some of the U.K.'s finest stage actors who took their roles seriously and acted the hell out of them.<br /><br />Brian Blessed as Voltan is fantastic per usual, and Timothy Dalton's Prince Baron is compelling.<br /><br />Too bad they were never able to make the trilogy, would have been epic!
B001H1UQRI|5.0|I bought this movie after for some reason being able to sleep to the sweet sounds of Edward Norton narrating this movie.  I tried to watch it every night to lull me off to my dreams but I hated that I would have to set up the timer on the tv and ps3, switch out discs and blah blah blah.  but since I downloaded the amazon video player I just pull it up on my iPad and drift away.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|my two year old would wach this movie every day .my dvr deleted its self one day she was so upset .I could not find it anywere.  then i thought about amazon and luck to the gods you had it . ihe movie was cheap and in new conditon when we got it..once agin thank you ....

B009PJXY3M|5.0|LOVE HER SONG. And it so catchy and fun to sing. I just think some for their first album that is this good deserves some credit. Great songs
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|It's about the same as the Call of Atlantis, and I don't understand how to get past level 6 on either of them.  Otherwise, I like them a lot.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Mr. Sanderson tells a story with a new, intriguing magic system and dynamic characters.  Same high standards I've come to expect from this author.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Holy crap, I am not a comic aficionado, but I would love to see a more of this story arc... Army of the Bat? Sons of Batman? Batmen? What will the impact ultimately be with superman? Will Superman wake up and realize what a freakin dumb-a pawn he is... Oh he is just following orders, OH the \\"people\\" don't want us anymore... Right cause the united states gov(especially that of the 1980s), is all of the people for the people...lol
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie is backwards from the book and at first i was a little irritated but it actually is really great. Love bradley and jennifer together!
B007L96VCY|5.0|I've looked for a long time for this album on CD.  I was glad to get it finally.  Thanks for the memories...great sound too!
B005LAII08|5.0|Pixar seems to top itself with every release, this one being no different.  The detail and quality just blows me away.  My kids love this movie.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I very much enjoy this type of logic puzzle. The pictures are beautiful. I like that there is no timer. My only complaint is after 3 mistakes you have to restart the puzzle. Update.  I just found in the options that you can ignore errors.
1401322786|4.0|I'm a Mitch Albom fan. His books, although fairly short and  easy to read, make me think about things in new ways. The &#34;Time Keeper&#34; alternates between the ancient past and the future, and between the lives of two contemporary figures, one older, one younger. The interweaving of stories comes to a conclusion that some may find predictable, but was nonetheless satisfying. The theme of how love and caring can transcend time should appeal to anyone who thinks and feels.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Three must have blue-ray movies. The first and last far make up the short comings of the second one. But the price and fast delivery of this blueray trilogy exceeds itself.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I am a simple enjoyer of music, I am not here to quibble about style of play or accuracy of interpretation. However what I do know that what I hear, I love.  The selection of pieces, the beauty of play, the quality of the recording here are all outstanding.  I also love the way that Valentiana is interactive through YouTube, Twitter, etc.  The depth and warmth of the Bosendorfer is well suited to these pieces.  This is a CD I can put on while working or with which I can sit down and just melt into.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|One word amazing.  I loved this book and thought it topped the first.  It kept me guessing and the ending was perfect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I appreciate being able to use my smart phone to access my current book when on the go. I don't always carry my Kindle anymore, even though I still love it as well!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read all the books and am looking forward for the 2nd movie to come out.  If you enjoyed the first two books, the final one is the best.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this show after hearing all the hype about it and fell instantly love...well the very first show took me a bit to get into it, but now I can't wait for Season 4.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I recommended this to my brother who also thought it was crazy but a good read.  It is odd, out of the norm, but fun.
B00881PTRC|1.0|The most important factor for potential buyers of this game (based on the classic Hangman) is that, like the \\"most helpful\\" review states, this game is multilingual (at least, it contains Spanish words).  While this same review commends this as an asset, I would argue that this is a major drawback in a word-based game.  The description for this app is entirely in English, and makes absolutely no mention of the game being otherwise, which would lead one to believe that it is intended for English-speaking players.  If the game is \\"multilingual\\" (i.e. not just in Spanish), it would also not necessarily be \\"even more enjoyable\\" for \\"non-English [speaking] players\\", unless the players happen to speak multiple languages, and English words are at a minimum (which would be even more of a drawback for English-speaking players).  At a time when non-English language settings and text are being included in software and on most other products, one may wonder why an English-only setting was not included with this game.  Not recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This one will get you hooked and then you will immediately get the next two.  Good series to read no matter what your age.
0988262592|4.0|Cudos to the authors for making the reader feel intelligent whilst introducing a ton of concepts. If you've got a security background, there is a LOT to learn from this book outside of our usual security bunker. However, they do fluff the security concepts a little from time to time - hence the 4 not 5 stars. But fundamentally this book is a work-style changer - highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book series is very good.  I know it is written for young adults, but I am 60 and still love it.
0345472640|5.0|This book starts off with action! Unlike the movie, this book focuses more on those who were facing a gruesome war and in a very honest manner.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Now we are finally caught up on the series.  It is a good set and makes for great weekend viewing or when you have run out of dvr stuff.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As you would expect this series is Outstanding.<br />Top acting, lots of plots to keep you wanting more.<br />brilliant costumes and sets.<br />I hope the series Never ends!
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|I have always loved line dancing and I like kevin and lori singer, they dance so beautifully.i loved the movie.
B000007NYS|5.0|All of Lucinda's music is awesome, she has a terrific voice and really makes the music come alive. I just wish I could travel and see one of her concerts live.
B0000524E5|5.0|piper has been one of my favorite actresses for quite a while and I love the singing and dancing that they do in this movie and of  course john goodman was fantastic in this movie, I hope she makes more movies, I love music and this was great movie for piper
0802473156|5.0|I would reccomend this book to any couple before getting married or if marriage is struggling a wonderful book to get

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very surprised with &#34;Fringe&#34;. I was told I wouldn't like it, too complicated, too &#34;twisty&#34;....boy were they wrong. As the father says to the son, &#34;let your imagination run&#34;....great series, I am sold.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|THE ACTING IS VERY GOOD. THE MOVIE IS WELL DONE IT IS ABOUT THE 13TH AMENDMENT FIGHT MOSTLY. NOT MUCH WARTIME DRAMA OR THRILLS.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was beautifully written.  The story was one that held your attention without letting go.  The fact that it's based on a true story makes it even more appealing.
B00993FEUK|5.0|This is such a cute movie and the when I saw the price for a Blu-ray combo pack I had to get it for my son.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|19-year old British singer/songwriter Jake Bugg hearkens back to the past on his debut [[ASIN:B009B1UZ7C Jake Bugg]] released via Mercury.  Recently released in the U.S, Bugg's released materialized in his native Britain back in October 2012, when he was only 18. Transcendent beyond his years, Bugg is the antithesis to his British pop contemporaries (One Direction, The Wanted).  Bugg's base is 50's and 60s rock, influenced by folk, garage, and traditional, organic sounds.  Eschewing synthesizers and programming, Bugg and his fellow musicians opt for acoustic and electric guitars, bass, and acoustic drums.<br /><br />\\"Lightening Bolt\\" starts the effort off brilliantly, uptempo and highly energetic in its approach. Brief it may be, the single packs a mighty, reminiscent punch (it is currently featured on a Gatorade commercial). Equally great is the addictive \\"Two Fingers\\", a cut where Bugg pleases with memorable lyrics \\"I drink to remember, I smoke to forget...\\" later affirming his gratitude to move on from the past (\\"So I kiss goodbye to every little ounce of pain / Light a cigarette and wish the world away / I got out, I got out, out alive / and I'm here to stay / So I hold two fingers up to yesterday / light a cigarette and smoke it all away / I got out, I got out, out alive / and I'm here to stay\\").  On \\"Taste It\\", the tempo remains quick, with the youngster delivering another compelling chorus against classic rock and roll production: \\"I can taste it / in my mouth it's just so bittersweet / it's right there in your eyes of apple green / it should be easy but it's hard to leave.\\"<br /><br />On \\"Seen It All\\", Bugg paints a moving portrait of the 'ills' of life (violence specifically), summing up that \\"..after tonight I've seen the light / but not the kind I would've liked.\\"  \\"Simple As This\\" features more thoughtful lyrics (\\"Tried absolution of the mind and soul / it only led me where I should not go...\\")  while \\"Country Song\\" keeps things simple, yet touching. \\"Broken\\" is among the album's best, with Bugg showcasing his emotions on the thoughtful ballad (\\"Wheels like tong to the winter lope / Down in the valley where the church bells cry / I'll lead them over to your eyes / I am one...\\").  He kicks the tempo back up for the brief \\"Trouble Town\\", a perfect pipeline to classic folk-rock. \\"Ballad of Mr. Jones\\" keeps that old-school sentiment alive and well, with Bugg resurrecting the 'ballad' singer/songwriter idea (think Springsteen, Dylan, etc.).  The three closing cuts (\\"Slide\\", \\"Someone Told Me\\", \\"Note To Self\\") continue to show Bugg's musicianship and great potential, even if they don't supersede the heavyweights from earlier.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B009B1UZ7C Jake Bugg]] reminds the US fan base of how powerful classic rock is and was.  A throwback who isn't an anachronism by any means, young Jake Bugg could be the link to the preservation and future of rock and roll.  Maybe that's a lofty task for a 19-year old newbie, but Jake Bugg is off to a fine start.  Add in his songwriting abilities, as well as his guitar/vocal chops, and a star is in the making. A highly recommended album by all means!oken\\" is among the album's best, with Bugg showcasing his emotions on the thoughtful ballad (\\"Wheels like tong to the winter lope / Down in the valley where the church bells cry / I'll lead them over to your eyes / I am one...\\").

B00BIVN82M|4.0|Canadian vocalist Michael Bubl&eacute; is easily one of the music industry's most consistent artists. In the vocal/easy listening genre, he is arguably the 'leader of the charge', easily adding more and more platinum plaques to his arsenal. His latest effort [[ASIN:B00BIVN82M To Be Loved]] doesn't alter his formula, but does yield exceptional balance between classical jazz standards, covers, and originals. As they say, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it?'  Always in top-notch voice, Bubl&eacute; 'does it again', ten years since [[ASIN:B000088E6D Michael Buble]].<br /><br />\\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" opens in traditional swinging manner.  Bubl&eacute;'s tone is perfect, fully articulate in the jazz vocal vein.  Adaptable as ever, Bubl&eacute; switches to bright pop on the original single \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\", which was co-penned by Bubl&eacute; with fellow \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" co-writers Amy S. Foster and Alan Chang.  A cut that radiates in jubilance, \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\" is the type of song that puts a smile on your face.  He visits classic pop on an excellent cover of the Bee Gees' \\"To Love Somebody\\" while growing even more rousing on a quicker, effective take on Smokey Robinson's penned \\"Who's Loving You\\", originally performed by The Jackson 5.<br /><br />Bubl&eacute; brings in Reese Witherspoon for vocal support on the solid \\"Something Stupid\\", before going solo once more on the James Van Heusen/Sammy Cahn classic, \\"Come Dance With Me\\".  Changing gears once more, Bubl&eacute; tugs at the heart strings on the adult contemporary pop of \\"Close Your Eyes\\", which might've sounded 'middle-of-the-road' had it been performed by a less talented performer. Better is the Bryan Adams duet \\"After All\\", which channels the same spark of earlier original \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\".  Vocal group Naturally 7 provide the assist on the Scott Wiseman penned classic \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You\\".  Not the best of the effort, \\"Have I Told You...\\" is as consistent as everything else.  Consistency is key.<br /><br />\\"To Be Loved\\" lives up to being the title of the album, as Bubl&eacute; delivers some of his most soulful nuances on the classic Berry Gordy (Motown) co-write.  Not to bog down the album with ballads, Disney's [[ASIN:B005ZMV2EQ Toy Story]] provides \\"You've Got A Friend In Me\\", of which Bubl&eacute; showcases his musical personality soundly.  The rest of the effort includes \\"Nevertheless (I'm in Love With You)\\" featuring the Puppini Sisters, \\"I Got It Easy\\" (another solid, though less notable of the originals), and closer \\"Young At Heart\\".<br /><br />As previously stated, Bubl&eacute; doesn't bring much, if anything, new to the table.  The other side of that argument is, he doesn't need to. Bubl&eacute; has pipes that most artists would kill to possess - he's that good.  [[ASIN:B00BIVN82M To Be Loved]] may feature more 'pop' than some of his past efforts which may turn off some 'purists', but he definitely performs them well.  Ultimately with little to nitpick, another excellent effort is to be had from an &uuml;ber-talented musician.To Be Loved\\" lives up to being the title of the album, as Bublé delivers some of his most soulful nuances on the classic Berry Gordy (Motown) co-write.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|What is up with all of the negativity of this new Cd? I think it is a wonderful mix of oldies, classics and newly written songs. That is what Michael has ALWAYS done on his disc. I love this collection of songs and as usual Michael delivers an outstanding vocal performance. Buy the Cd, it is as good as any in the past. You won't be sorry. I think it is \\"WONDERFUL\\"!!!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|After seeing what has happened to our economic system in the recent years we should all take this advice seriously and learn how to manage our personal resources better. I've learned a lot from this book that I'm implementing already.
B009K86D86|5.0|A revealing documentary of the modern day food industry giants.<br />Very good story telling and direction.<br />Excellent documentary to understand the facts behind mass production of the food we eat.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The show the writers, producers, even the actors are brilliant as they work out everyday issues and summarize in this show. It's amazing to watch and the first time I watched the episode I was hooked. As a woman it faces what everyday woman go through particularly if you a lawyer..
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Keep it coming Steve, never enoug Maiden!  Up the Irons!  Hopefully new studio album in the works.  Touring this September
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|good movie for a cheap night in. Yes, there are some flaws to this movie and it's not super funny but good for a night in and when you've had a stressful week and just don't want to think anymore.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A very good book. It is absolutely amazing what are men and women go through on a daily basis and they deserve the upmost  respect.. Marcus you are a true American hero , thank you for everything you have done for our country.. Hooyah!!!!
B00BF11STU|1.0|Waste of money, waste of time.  If I wanted to watch a torture movie I would have watched Passion of the Christ.  The acting was horrible!  The end of the movie was a joke.  Make the screen black and add some noises.  I have no idea how this movie was nominated/won awards.  I love movies, even when people rate them low, I find them to be entertaining and give them a higher rating, but this movie.... A total joke!
B0080K3G4O|5.0|The idea expressed here is so counterintuitive and yet so important that there will never be enough ways to remind ourselves of it. This is one of the clearest, least partisan, most grounded books you'll find about it. That the author is clearly a skeptic only adds to the effect.<br /><br />It is true that little here is being said for the first time. However, its succinctness sets it apart, as does its insistence that the basic ideas are simple, though anything but easy. This is anything but fluff; the writer dances lightly through some of the biggest ideas known, and you'll finish with an unexpectedly comprehensive overview of the subject.<br /><br />I'd rank this with The Black Swan and a very few other recent books that I'd recommend to anyone who wants to actually understand what's going on but doesn't care about flavors of the month or proprietary systems. Appropriate for all ages. I dare say even fun--Burkeman is clearly something of a philosophical counselor himself. Very highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a fun book to get lost in. I will be looking into more books by this author. Out.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|I'm certainly not a prude, but where do you draw the line between entertaining and gross???  I read only the first 2 chapters.  I now know more words for &#34;vagina&#34; that I ever hoped to know, as well as all the &#34;joys&#34; of masturbation.  I'm embarrassed to have it on my Kindle.  UGH!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book has great pacing and character development. Once I started reading it I had trouble putting it down at night to go to sleep (I mean who really needs sleep anyway). The narrative of Kvothe's story is breathtakingly beautiful and full of humor and action. This novel is by far the best book I have read all year and it's predecessor (Name of the Wind) is just as good. I would recommend this book to anyone who like fantasy, magic, or middle earth action.  There's even a tiny bit of a romance in here for the ladies. If you don't read this series  you will be missing out on a great story that will be read and re read for years to come.
031250926X|5.0|This is great  as a board book and also the slide and find feature means it will be less likely to be destroyed by little hands. The toddler loves sliding the flap to see the &#34;red bird&#34; or &#34;blue horse&#34;. It's a great tool for teaching colors. The pictures are very vivid.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A good story with intrigue and twists that kept me reading. I found the sexual situations to be pretty far fetched, but its fiction after all.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It's been a while since I have read a book that keeps me up at night because I just want to find out what happens next.  This is one of those books.  I know so little about the time period of WWI and this book has piqued my interest so that I have to do some more research into the time period.  I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing, can't wait til 0.7.0, but still a AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!<br />BUY IT, ITS AWESOME AND FUN, for all people of all ages
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book is easy to read and seems factual. At times it is a little tedious, but still quite readable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it!  A great way for me to relax and just shut my mind down.  No bugs experienced.  Great graphics.  Just turn the sound off.
B007P7UF0G|4.0|I haven't watched it yet. I bought it because I have had the music record for years, Will watch it soon.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|very entertaining, good space battle sequences, very twisted plot, a fun romp and good satire, funny translations, a combo of star trek and Babylon 5.

The crawling into the room is so she won't awaken her sleeping child. The crawling into the window is not something \\"realistic\\" but just saying how far a mothers love goes, no matter where your child may be. This book is so touching!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kathleen Grissom's work of historical fiction, which focuses on the issue of slavery in America, is a compelling tale. Once I began reading, I couldn't put it down and I think other readers will agree. The story is told through two voices, one of a Negro slave named Belle; the other through a white indentured servant, Lavinia. The characterization, settings and plot are very well-developed and will keep the reader very engaged with the fate of each character.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|If your looking for a game that keeps you on your toes then download this app.It's a blast when playing against someone else..the graphics are good quality<br />.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book and I loved Walking Disaster as well. You got both sides of the story and it was well written.
B0095ESTLO|5.0|The Night Circus is a good story.  It is rich in descriptive detail and fascinating characters. The central idea of an enchanted circus that opens only at night alone is enough to get your imagination going.  Add to that two people who are bound to the circus from a young age. I found that when I took a break from listening, I was imagining all sorts of possibilities for the continuation of the story.<br /><br />The reader does a lovely job with the extensive cast of voices.  I'm very picky about the readers of audiobooks, and this is one I will look for again.  He does a terrific job conveying mood and tension as the story progresses, and is thoroughly consistent in his portrayal of the characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I felt that the last third of the book didn't hold up to the expectations I had for it.  It seemed to pull in ideas that came out of nowhere, and ramble about.  My apologies to the author but it seemed that she was struggling with how to conclude it.<br /><br />Overall, worth the read (listen)!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I bought this for $25 i should have realized there was a catch.  This is an old machine at least 5 years old. It has a lousy way of  emtying dust tray. How do I know? Ive bought 5-6 of these over the years.. They last about a year, if you are lucky.. Buyer beware  the ones that are black are old machines, the red ones have a better way to dump the tray
B005LAII4E|5.0|In order to appreciate the constant action scenes and the cliché plot line, you've gotta be a fan of the G.I. Joe franchise, as I am, before watching.<br /><br />To a casual movie-goer, this film seems like a boring toy-selling vehicle with a half-baked plot and bland characters.<br /><br />To a fan of the franchise, it got every part right. Cobra comes up with an evil plan, G.I. Joe stops it, it even has the classic Commander Bailing Out Early In A Helicopter bit.<br /><br />Basically, fans of G.I. Joe will love it, but anyone else should stay away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've just finished this book and I must admit,  it is completely incredible!  I'm happy they have the entire series for free because I know I'll DEFINITELY be reading the next one.
B000062X90|5.0|I had this recording as an LP many years ago. It's a classic. Anyone interested in great guitar playing should grab this.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|So far they are just as true to the books as the Tolken series, or for you non-readers, The Lord of the ring series.  Fantastic story, stunning visuals.  I forgot about all the sex, though.  Definately, don't watch if even a chance small children, or even your teens are around.  Really!  Awkward moment when your 15 year old son is on the couch with you and almost a porn scene comes on. Lol.  Even though I know what happens, I can't wait to &#34;see&#34; it on video!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Say what you will about the Brits and their rigid class system, Downton Abbey succeeds in creating three dimensional characters at a time of social upheaval.  The upper lips may be stiff, but the acting never is.  Fun to watch, you'll be ready for the next episode as soon as the credits start to roll.
B00742GBDM|5.0|Truely a movie to die for. I just loved this movie it was one of my most favorite of all time.
0563362863|5.0|I got a used copy a couple days ago, and I'm really excited to read it. She explains in great detail the things an aspiring chef should know. And she demonstrates with recipes.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Great acting and wonderful story line.<br />If you like these kind of movies this is a must watch. Very romantic.
B008C20TDG|4.0|I'm currently at the tail end of my 2nd Whole30 challenge and it was vastly improved by reading the literature and not just following the guidelines put forth on their website. This book is informative, illuminating, well written, and easy to understand.<br /><br />I now have a better understanding of food and how my body interacts with it. Did it ruin some food for me? Maybe, but it's just food that doesn't make me feel good anyhow. I learned better technique for meal structure (including healthy fat is key!) and how to eliminate snacking (which was my main goal).<br /><br />My food vocabulary has grown and they types of food I cook and eat has expanded vastly. I recommend this book for anyone looking to overhaul their nutrition and learn new eating habits. I also recommend it to anyone who is looking to lose weight, my partner lost 23lbs over 7 months by taking on Whole30 challenges and ultimately eating cleaner.
B0047VSW30|3.0|Was a little hard to follow until the end.  I don't like how the end happened but then I wasn't the one writing the story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|By far my favorite app on the kindle fire. Works great, no complains. I can even pin pages from the browser by sharing the page. Love it!
B00AGJ4HC2|2.0|I am not trying to say this game is bad...it's just no where near as good as the hype suggests.  I sold this back to my FLGS after 6 plays.  Four 2 player and two 4 player games.  It is very predictable and easy.  It's a filler game, but one with very little meat to it.  Whoever draws the right card will win, zero strategy.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I just love the old classic Star Trek episodes. They are just so fun to watch! It is like reliving my childhood again.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Astonishingly eloquent and street-wise lyrical, this is the vivid memoir of a middle-class Dartford boy who grew up in the challenge of post-war England and managed to spin his love of the blues and the guitar into a golden career with one of the greatest rock bands. He writes as if the reader was his confident. At once brilliant, witty, wistful, and unapologetic. A glimpse into the behind-the-scenes life world of a vintage rock star, complete with glamour and dross, as well as the blood, sweat, and tears it took to rise to the top and stay there. There are no end to the magnificent tales of peaks and valleys, and Richards has an engaging way of sharing what he knows about keeping ahead of the pack to keep his chops sharp and the band on key. The soul of a band that continues to give as good as it gets.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie.  Historical enough and entertaining.  I'm not a history buff but found myself engrossed the entire movie.  And it is a movie to watch more than once.
0316223239|4.0|Jack, this novel's narrator, is a five-year-old who has always lived with his mother in a tiny apartment -\\"room\\"-. With his childish language, very limited due to the narrowness of his world, Jack recounts the stifling routine within which his and his mom's life develop. Soon, though, we learn the tragic truth: the young woman has been for seven years kidnapped by a psychopath who rapes her. She has already had a still-born child, and now Jack, around whom her life turns. Her character is truly admirable for her strength and courage. In spite of her inexperience, she devises a daily program which has allowed her to remain sane and educate her son, whose behavior is not much different from, say, that of any only child.<br /><br />When the novel begins, the young woman is at the end of her endurance, and so she designs a plan to escape, which depends on Jack playing his part to perfection. This is the best part of the book: the plan's development, the conversations between the woman and Jack (who eagerly participates in the plot, giving ideas and discussing his mother's), the increasing excitement, the building up of tension and, when the moment approaches, Jack's doubts and panic, as well as the woman's painful need to put pressure on him, which amounts to unavoidable cruelty. All this grows to a stressful climax excellently managed.<br /><br />There's no point in spoiling the rest; suffice it to say that, in the second part, the novel falls down. Certain processes become much less credible than in the intensely sustained first part, and the lengthening of the narration in childish language gets tiresome and becomes an involuntary self-parody. A change of narrator could have worked, or it could have remained a short-story. All in all, a good idea taken to extremes, but worth reading.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|I bought this particular version of Hipe's Auto Motion sensing Night lights since the description said it stayed on for 30 seconds after the last motion was sensed (the other one says 10 seconds).  That is incorrect.  I just received this product and tested it - it only lasts for 5 seconds.  The light output is not bad - I would not call it super bright but for a night light its pretty good.  The Velcro strip provided is just about an inch in length and I have my doubts about whether it would hold up with 4 AA batteries installed and installed overhead (where I plan to install it), but since I have my own rolls of Velcro tape that is not an issue.<br />  After installing it overhead, I would NOT recommend that you attach Velcro to the battery cover (what seems to be the most logical placement since it is smack dab in the middle of the back) - the battery cover comes off quite easily without much pressure.  I initially placed two strips to fit into the battery cover and when testing to see what weight/pressure they would withstand, when tried pulling the unit from the Velcro, the unit came off quite easily with the battery cover stuck to the Velcro.  So I added two more Velcro strips above and below the battery cover.<br />  I have since replaced this with a Mr. Beams MB980 ceiling light, which not only lasts longer (30 seconds) but produces more light (100 lumens vs I would estimate 10-20 lumens, but then it uses 4 C batteries vs AA batteries in the Hipe).  I have repositioned the Hipe as a Hallway light and there it does quite well.  For walking in the Hallway, 5 seconds is ideal.  In addition the Hipe has a fairly long range in its sensor - a good 20 ft compared to 10-15 ft in other motion sensing battery powered lights I have tried.
B000127LW2|3.0|Even though Season one is a little shorter and not as exciting as the other seasons it still has some note worthy episodes.  The best of which is Faces.  B'elana's Clingon DNA is use to make two of her.  It's truly an amazing episode, and the main reason I purchased season one.  I also enjoyed Parallax, Prime Factors and the pilot episode Caretaker.  I think the writers were very smart ending the Caretaker episode and the final episode Endgame in season 7 with Captain Janeway saying the same lines.  \\"Set a course for home.\\"  What a perfect ending for both episodes, and in my opinion the best Star Trek of the whole franchise.
1878424319|5.0|Definitely agreements to remember and live by; so many truths to share. Could be the source of your newfound happiness.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Dont watch with your kids! Not funny more stupid. Very dissappointed. Wish I never watched it. Can't believe it targeted Kids!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Great shape got quickly, sounds good not very different from the other but worth giving a listen too if you like the Beatles
B0086HGW42|5.0|No words can describe how amazing Ed is or how heartfelt all of the songs on this album are. I love Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz so Ed Sheeran fits right into my life. Not a bad song on this album. Buy it!
B007N8RULO|4.0|Ease of playing game ,Did not like all of the ads, don't like being demanded to give specific no. of words.  Probably won't do this again.!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy the challenge. It's a game that everyone can play and it is a easy and playable game. It's not like temple run, it's a new challenge everyday. Hope my review.encourages you to get this app.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I would watch it again  it seemed slow at times and then would catch up again the final scenes made the movie with Robert  Duval
B004EPZ070|2.0|The playing of this movie was horrible!! I could hardly even watch it, Kate Hudson looked terrible. I guess I should buy an old tv to get a better movie experience. I read the book and liked the movie it just did not look good, I mostly listened to it.
B000XAE3IM|5.0|You should always carry spares.  This is a must with the Sony cameras because when you least expect it, you have run out of power and it's easy to swap for your fully charged spare battery
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Truly the zenith of natural running books.  Find peace with your inner running self - do yourself a favor and embrace your origin.  Set your feet free.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Very enjoyable game. Would have liked to be able to have fast Travelled to places on the map instead of having to back track.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Nothing wrong with the merchandise or the music, whatsoever. I would recommend the album for sure. Jack White is astounding, as always.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Five stars is pushing it, but deserved for the amazing wordsmith and the entertaining plot throughout most of the book. The ending is a bit deflating given the quality of the overall experience, but all in all a great book.
B008ODZUN2|2.0|This is not worth your time. A poor choice for Rachel Weisz to make this movie. It is about a pathetic woman who leaves her husband for basically sex with a guy she finds hot. He doesn't love her like she loves him and she keeps trying to commit suicide. Sound uplifting? Don't bother!
B002ZCLH5S|5.0|Quirky and fantastic, a great adventure, especially for boys, and interestingly directed.  Ad the kids do a great job.  I can readily recommend it.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I'll admit the tune didn't 100% phase me at first, but as it went on I realized that it was the same flavor of Daft Punk I've come to know (and love) since their humble beginning.  Looking forward to what their album has in store for us all in May!
B009VB97EY|4.0|These guys have thee most amazing bodies!!! I give it 4 stars for the type of movie it is, not because i think it's Oscar-worthy, although there SHOULD be a category for hot men that can dance!! Girls will love this movie..enough said!
B0032Y8XH8|3.0|Didn't realize that the only Mumford & Sons song I REALLY like is &#34;I Will Wait.&#34; Get that on Youtube.<br />Will play this CD in my car. Surprise to me---that I have not like more of the Mumford songs.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I really do not understand this game. My son likes it though. I downloaded it for him and now he will not get off. That's.why I gave it a poor rating. That is all.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend this book as a roadmap to a Simpler and less cluttered daily existence. I found her suggestions easy to follow, practical and empowering.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids, ages 4, 7 and 9 love this game. It's challenging but easy enough that even the youngest has a lot of fun.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game does get difficult and it may start eating time but if you keep with it the game is great.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Great game the whole family plays. Very addictive with a lot of hours full of fun. Diffidently worth .99 cents....
B00821OX98|3.0|We are into the fourth episode of season two and are a little disappointed. The concept if the show and the acting is very good. But there are many typical \\"chick flick\\" moments.  The aliens are on the way to attack the camp, but we have time to explore our feelings.  I'm worried this show might end up like \\"Lost\\" and really be going nowhere.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|This series was interesting watching.  I was wrapped and wanted it to go on forever. If you are a Sci-Fi buff this is for you.
B00AQMQBKK|3.0|The mechanics mimic what you'd find on the board game well. I have had a few times where it's frozen, and where I've tried to drag an icon to complete a challenge and it would not let me.
B005H9B44A|2.0|I don't read comic books, just watched this film because it was free streaming for prime members, and because I was surprised how much I enjoyed both Iron Man movies. This one's not at that level. Decent acting, but the over-the-top computer-generated graphics and poorly written dialog totally overwhelm their performances. I recommend skipping it if you're not already interested in the characters or the Marvel franchise.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love that they are hooked up, this comedic blend of crime and humor is just what i need at the end of a busy day.  The cast is a perfect match.  They all play well off each other.  Keep up the good work!
0062059963|5.0|I absolutely love this book! The author has many refreshingly different character personalities, even though it has a partial love triangle. I was not dissapointed with this sequel!
0062014536|2.0|I was very disappointed with this novel.  I really enjoy the first 2 books in the series however this really let me down.  The ending was not really an ending in my opinion.  One minute they are fighting the next the book is over with no real conclusion.  The love triangle is NOT resolved and you never really know who she ends up with.  The series is about LOVE and to not resolve that major plot line in the story was unforgivable.  I loved book 2 and I was really looking forward to this book to see how it would all tie together- but it didn't.  No real conflict resolution happened which is a serious bummer since the trilogy is over now.  Very glad I got this book from the library and didn't pay for it.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|An enjoyable version of Northanger Abbey.  Could have used a little more 'story' to go along with the romance but otherwise ok.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|I chose this rating becasue the zip sleeve fits over my kindle perfectly and protects it from damage.  I would recomend it to others.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|This was a good movie.  Has good acting and a good story, scenery.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes BBC type shows.
B0030MTQNW|5.0|Keep this one in my lineup of great classics - enjoy the action, the actors, the scenery, the director's vision of this war period.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I waited a long time before I rented this movie. I hated to toss money to the wind. After seeing a review it looked different than I thought so I made the jump.<br /><br />Kids would probably not remember vintage computer games but younger boomers would. So was it aimed at children or younger boomers. You decide.  I enjoyed it but can not rave about it.<br /><br />My special ratings. 31/2 bags of popcorn out of 5
B001GJ9GG8|5.0|Can you say &#34;wow&#34; to the combo of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones in the captivating and spine-tingling, deliciously naughty crime film!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I had no idea of the struggles Lincon had to free the slaves with the democrats, this was a great history lesson and the movie effects were fatastic.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|Grew up with wholesome sci-fi like this - always good to revisit classics and compare to today's high tech productions.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|An avid reader and dear friend of mine suggested this book.  When I first started it, I thought I wouldn't like the format in which it was written--letter form.  However, the clever author made characters and history come alive in her fascinating story of post-WWII England, specifically Guernsey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy the running games. This is a running game times 10. YOU GET TO RIDE A HOVERBOARD. And a jetpack. It's really cute and fun. I didn't think I would like this game and it's one actually one of my favorites now :)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|it started out kind of juvinile but eventually picked up the pieces from the prior book.I'm looking forward to reading the next installment.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Growing old is nothing to laugh at until you read this book.  History, who-done-it, romance, and farce kept me intrigued and surprised as I accompanied this centarian on his wild journey.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time. Great characters, great stories and great acting. One of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|A great second book, can't wait for the third! I wish the characters weren't quite so dense about the rebel attacks but they got there in the end.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great job on portraying this event. We never really know about these type things until years later.  These people were very brave
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter and I love this game. It is easy enough for her to play in the lower levels and still challenging enough for me in the upper levels. It keeps us both entertained.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very usefull to stay organized!<br />I replaced the Calender app I had that came with<br />My Android phone.  This is much better.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show. I laugh out loud while watching every episode. I am always delightfully surprised at their hijinks and shenanigans.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son loves this game and it is very challenging. I would recommend to anyone for ages 5 and up
B00498YZH8|2.0|It wasn't the kind of movie that I enjoy watching. It wasn't a terrible movie, just, not my cup of tea.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Worth the watch. Good quality hd video makes it a smooth watch on amazon prime. Hope amazon adds more such movies to the prime list
B00947N6UG|4.0|my ChildreN Love It And It Came Right When It Said It Would Just In Time For EasteR I Don't Know What Else To Say About This
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I enjoyed this score, but I did not love it.<br /><br />Many of the themes are very close to what Daft Punk used in its score for Tron: Legacy. The similarities are not a huge problem, especially if you liked the Tron score, but they make this effort from M83 feel familiar but unoriginal. You get the sense at times you've heard the music before.<br /><br />I would recommend this to fans of M83 and to fans of movie scores. More casual listeners might want to go straight to Daft Punk's Tron:Legacy score.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I'd seen the movie, Lincoln, and became interested in reading one of the best resources for it.  I'm usually not a nonfiction reader, but this was a real page turner.  I've always admired Doris Kearns Goodwin for her scholarly approach to anything she touches, her articulate comments when on news programs, and her excellent writing.  I've read the book and now know all the players and want to see the movie again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The plot: GENIOUS! The feelz: SO MUCH The hawtness: OMGSOHAWT! This is my all-time most favorite book! I read itin one sitting, and that's saying something because I have the attention span of a 3 year old.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game so works great on my kindle fire so would recommend it to all. Better on kindle fire than pc. No freezing.
B004TSKKF4|5.0|One if the best novels ever! You will not want to put it down- a brilliant read- very well written
B000OXHRRC|5.0|I love this movie. It always makes me want to drop everything and move to an inherited wine vineyard in France.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This app is lots of fun!! I am enjoying it immensely. I have always liked playing this game on the computer so it is great to have it in my tablet.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Free Angry Birds! Need I say more? I got this for my kindle. Not amazing quality but definitely better than playing on a tiny screen. Another activity that will just make time disappear.
0062059963|4.0|There is no \\"second book syndrome\\" here. Oh no. On the contrary. Without the burden of backstory and world building, we're thrust into the story immediately. To say that it was gripping was putting it mildly. I started The Elite while I was waiting for my car to be inspected. I was actually irritated when it was done, because I knew that I would actually have to put it down for the 15 minutes it would take me to get home!<br /><br />The main focus of The Selection was, well, on The Selection. That isn't the case in The Elite. The thrust of the story is on America's seemingly impossible choice between her childhood love and the new feelings blooming for the prince of her world. Truly, America waffles back and forth several times during the course of this book, for, what I thought were very good reasons. I can't imagine it's an easy choice to make, no matter which \\"team\\" I'm on (which would be Maxon's, by the way).<br /><br />Aspen is safe, comfortable and a sure thing. He claims to have never stopped loving America and that he still wants to marry her. He says he supports and understands her continued involvement in The Selection, however, his support seems to have a limit. He has a lot of confidence in his feelings and abilities, but not in America's.<br /><br />Then there's Maxon. He's the prince, for goodness sake. He's romantic and noble and seems devoted to America, despite having five other girls to entertain as well. But, then, that's the real problem, isn't it? He still has to pretend he's interested in the others, which gives America pause. That and her lack of confidence in her own abilities.<br /><br />I felt so much frustration as I was reading The Elite. It's that good bookish frustration you get when the characters you love are doing things that are stupid. You can see the disastrous results from their poor choices coming a mile away, yet you're powerless to stop it. All three of our main characters did things like this in The Elite, and it made me nuts! It also made me want to keep reading page after page to see if they were going to be able to right their wrongs.<br /><br />The only thing that I felt was missing was the lack of new information about the rebels. They weren't mentioned much, and I was hoping for more about them. I have a feeling, though, that their presence will play a key part in the last book.<br /><br />The ending, although not a cliffhanger, left me wanting so much more! There are so many questions to be answered, new conflicts to be explored, and so many threats to my favorite characters' happiness. Waiting a whole year to find out what happens is going to be so difficult!<br /><br />Check out my entire review here - [...]!

B004UJAOLM|5.0|While this is a dark novel, the story is beautiful. It is one of my favorite classics and would recommend. Good for AP English!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Beautifully written.  Backs his experience with scientific proof. His experience gives us hope and might make death a little less scary.
B008476HBM|5.0|Another fantastic AP English read and LIFE read. Pride and Prejudice is very enjoyable and yes there's a movie but really, just sit down with the book. It contains witty dialogue and beautiful quotes in the English language.
1451695195|4.0|This book has much to think about.  I'm not sure I understand it completely, but believe I probably will not FULLY get it - until I'm on my way to the Core.  Thanks to Dr. Eben for taking us deeply into an unknown Place.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Cleaned up my memory on my Kindle Fire.  Easy to download and use.<br />Great download if your Kindle is full with no memory left for other downloads<br />.

B008B68IEA|3.0|But it was not worth the money.  Just an overpriced, cheap to manufacture piece of plastic.  If your kids are into Monster High, you may enjoy it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I've tried out a few Alex Cross and Jack Reacher's, and this is by far the best I've read so far. It Jumps into the storyline, and keeps you guessing throughout. I would highly recommend.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I bought this for my kids to watch.  I enjoyed it myself as a kid, and it just seems to be one of those timeless movies that generations enjoy.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|A unique, clever and absolutely hilarious movie. A talented rat and a not-so-talented garbage boy pair up as a superb cook team in a gourmet Parisian restaurant.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I'm not going to get technical. It simply wasn't my favorite bond movie.  I do enjoy the 007 movies with Daniel Craig, it just wasn't my favorite story.
1451624468|5.0|I give \\"A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING\\" a five star rating even though I disagree with Dr. Krauss regarding some of his representations. In the paragraphs below I comment on some of the points that can be brought into the conversation when one discusses this magnificent book . \\"A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING\\" is a great reference source for those who conduct their science with God in mind and for those who prefer not to include him in their studies.<br />​<br />God tells us that in the Beginning the world was Void ; but does that mean that it was empty ? Perhaps it was only void of things open to our understanding ; yet still contained something that we are unaware of . We can calculate the volume, length , height and width that surrounds an airy space ; but science cannot confirm or deny by experiment or calculation that such a space is truly and completely empty of all things and of all forces . True emptiness is a state beyond our imagining . So much so that it may rest beyond our ability to define it . We don't even have a list of all those things that might be located within a so called empty space that haven't been discovered yet. Since mankind cannot ascertain with absolute surety that a true state of emptiness ever exists ; the possibility must be left open that some sort of natural phenomena , yet to be discovered, might occupy a space that we've called empty . Where there exists a natural phenomena there also exists Laws and Mathematical Relationships even though they may remain unknown to us . These laws and mathematics found within the void of earth's early history helped to create the plentiful harmonious adjuncts to the operation of our universe such as gravity , electricity, magnetism and so forth . All of these things seemingly exist in emptiness. In the Beginning the world was void as far as goes our understanding ; but it probably wasn't empty. At the least if it was empty ; science cannot define it as such by either experiment or calculation.<br /><br />I must reject some of what Dr. Krauss offers until science can define with absolute certainty that THE LAWS AND MATHEMATICS OF EMPTINESS exist . I say this because although it seems counter intuitive ; emptiness , if it exists must have its own set of laws and mathematics. Being able to describe emptiness by way of Law and Calculation is Science . Accepting the existence of Emptiness without the benefit of Law and Calculation is a Faith of its Own Kind.  In addition if emptiness exists it is legitimate to debate whether it is a structural building block in the transformation of energy into matter. We must also determine if emptiness is a force of nature like electricity and magnetism ; or instead only the absence of all things . In the historical sense the use of the word empty was appropriate because there was no reasonable expectation that anything new would be dscovered within a so called empty space. This is no longer the case so the terms empty and nothingness may have become outdated . Perhaps we should use the term Undefined Condition or some such instead of empty.  I hope that these further considerations are addressed by Dr. Krauss in a future effort. AND OH YEAH ; PRAISE THE LORD.<br /><br />MORRISON : THEORETICAL COVENANT PHYSICIST, TCP

B008YCMM2A|5.0|[my quick, improvised jazz impression of album]: It was about the moment, about fitting everything that came before and everything that could come later into a perfect meshing of sounds that existed in the now. Happily for us, we get the sounds they played preserved.<br /><br />Of course also recommended is [[ASIN:B00136JQMI Kind Of Blue]]; get it if you don't already own it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is a book I can see myself reading over and over. With its vivid descriptions of both the beautiful and the horrifying, the prose has immortalized itself in my mind and the twisting tale of love and endurance has forever changed me. For anyone searching for adventure and heartfelt emotion, I highly recommend this.
0061950726|5.0|Engaging, fast paced plot with great characterization. This intriguing well-written story of a nine year old Irish-American orphan placed on a train in New York with many other orphans to find homes in the mid-west is bittersweet. Simultaneously, we are involved with another bittersweet plot line of a 17 year old foster child in 2011 Maine.  Both are compelling characters and stories that segue smoothly.  Yet, both are stories of fate--how all things in life turn out for the best.  Perhaps we can't see the road while we are on it, but in the end our vision is clear.  This is a book you won't put down.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Scary book of course, couldn't put it down.  Didnt realize it was a short little story.  This is the second book I have purchased.  I just got a tablet.  The book was so short I only got a couple hours reading out it.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I don't go to the movies and I liked this show and its numerous &#34;in concert&#34; redos on television<br />The songs in the show are very powerful. They a smothered in the movie. Some of the sets look very &#34;back lot.&#34;
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|I knew when I started reading this that I'd not be able to read it on the plane because I laughed so hard I feared disturbing other passengers. Finish it before you go - it is accurate and enlightening as well as entertaining.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use pinterest and the Internet to look up recipes, party, home decorating and organizing ideas and so much more. I used to have to print everything or add it to my favorites. Now I can save it all in one place.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|This is a very good movie, well acted and directed.  It is just sort of slow moving, strangely enough.  There are some great moments, and the end raid of Bin Laden's compound is amazing, but at times it was almost a little boring, if that is possible given the subject matter.  I would recommend it and it did make me think and really gave me an appreciation of these kinds of operations and what happened in the man hunt.
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|1) overall too short<br />2) should have included the original theme along with the tricked out version (hence minus 1 star)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have waited, I have out it off, refusing to join the masses who swoon over Downton Abbey.  Oh my goodness, just give in!  The only good part of waiting so long is being able to watch one right after another and another. Seasons 1 2 and 3 in a bit over three weeks.  I don't know that I could deal with waiting a week between episodes.<br />Now the hardest part is counting the months to season four?  Tell me there will be a season four.<br />And  this is all from someone who is not a fan of costumes, period pieces and lives of the grand and rich...but this transcends all of it.
0920668364|5.0|This book still makes me cry even though my boys are all grown and successful young men. Definitely a keeper.  I purchased this for my new grandson.  I will love you forever!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is one of the best action hero TV that I have ever seen.<br />I think its real... vivid... action-full... amazing...
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Just as good as it was in the theater.<br />The blog was fun to watch and amazing at how much effort is expended in this Hollywood magic.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Lots of fun. New way to waste time with the birds having the power of the force with them.  Pop up ads are annoying.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Another witty bit of science fiction, loaded with satire.  And if you're into \\"meta\\" or \\"nested\\" type fiction - this is right up your alley.  (And if you're not...  you're probably not going to like this one.)<br /><br />Also, if you're a writer (or want to be) - the \\"Three Codas\\" are a fascinating exercise.  One is written in 3rd person, the 2nd in 2nd person, and the last in 1st person.  Good stuff... it manages not only to be a good story, but almost seems like the author is showing off his writing chops.  :)
0307592731|4.0|Great read; not a slow moment and the honesty was touching.<br />Glad she didn't minimize the dangers of a young woman traveling alone but, at the same time, celebrate the courage (as short sighted as it was) and the emphasis on the shared experience and relationships with her co-travelers, as they wove in and out of her hike.<br />The worries about weight of her pack and the REI promotion were genuine and humorous.<br />Rite of passage? Maybe. Glad she shared hers with us.<br />Looking forward to reading more of Cheryl's work.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This is a fun game but it gets to be pretty difficult as you continue to play the game.  I like it but am having trouble proceeding with it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Opened the box and broken pieces fell everywhere! Very flimsy and not the real thing. Pretty much flushed my money down the toilet with this purchase.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Fans of this series will find themselves satisfied by this final volume.  Sanderson pulls together thousands of pages of text and gives Wheel if Times fans a last battle they will relish.
B0010T75W6|4.0|I love musicals and this was heartwarming, nonsensical at times, but very much a great time and money worth spent!
B009R659L8|5.0|Ms Clark is one of my favorite authors. I have never been disappointed in any of her books . I am just reading it but I love it now. I will finish in another day. Great bool.
B000002J0P|5.0|Did I say album?  Yeah, I still do have the album and I still play it on the turn table.  But, I do want to save the wear on my old vinyl, and I also want to listen to some of the old stuff I like, in my car.  Great music.
B004C3DLJ8|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie and it keeps her busy when we are in the car or waiting at the doctors office. She just loves it. She now can watch at home or on the go.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is Andrea's latest recordings from Italy.  The selection of music is exellent and the duets are very enjoyable.  Excellent Service.
B000002HEP|5.0|Quirky way of naming songs, they kinda run together, so it's like four songs at a time. Good drop-tuned heavy sound. Filled a gap in my Kyuss CDs.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|I've grown up listening to then since the beginning and they have always been about music of the heart and for the people. This album is no different it rocks!!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|There is a reason Clarke is a cornerstone of science fiction and this is a prize example of his style.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Very disappointing.  I am not a fan of her writing style, and the entire series was lacking an interesting plot line.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Ok, so its a game that puts a twist on the normal hangman. I like how Its set up and even how when you lose it is constantly animated. The words after a while repeat though, and it can get rather boring. This game should be mostly played when you are bored and have timei to play a &quot;quickly.&quot; I give points for the idea, but they should expand it a bit more. It's not a bad game, worth a dollar if you ask me. But anything<br />more I would not recommend.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The story had my attention right from the beginning to end!! I loved it. David Baldacci is one of my favorit authors.
B000W2W4JQ|5.0|This copy of The Little Prince was indeed the Katherine Woods translation, and it was wonderful. The book arrived in a good time frame and had little signs of wear and tear, it just looked like a well loved book! I'm very happy with this purchase.
B0054YHB8Q|3.0|BOSTON-DON'T LOOK BACK: The dreaded sophomore curse has always been tough for any rock band to overcome, especially one that enjoyed the biggest selling debut platter of its era; in spite of its optimistic title, DON'T LOOK BACK wasn't taking any chances. Band mastermind/control freak TOM SHOLZ wrote and played practically every meticulous note here, with high pitched marvel BRAD DELP supplying his usual theatrical vocal punch...but &#34;there's nothing new under the sun&#34;, as the saying goes. The title smash is little more than MORE THAN A FEELING rebooted, PARTY is second hand SMOKIN' and FEELIN' SATISFIED clones ROCK & ROLL BAND and/or PEACE OF MIND (take your pick). The six and a half minute hit A MAN I'LL NEVER BE stands out if only because it's a slick power ballad and a hint as to the MOR direction the next disc THIRD STAGE would take. For BOSTON fans who couldn't get enough of that famous first album's soaring multi-layered guitars and vocals, DON'T LOOK BACK probably won't offend...except maybe those listeners expecting a little more the second time around.<br /><br />RATING: THREE REPLAYS
B004CUVRF6|5.0|This movie is so Beautifully animated. and wonderful to watch. the story is Captivating and and a great movie to watch again and again
1451695195|4.0|I think all should read this book, good proof that all things are not as they seem. Maybe we all need to rethink the way we live.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Love the way Wreck it Ralph was done a fun movie the whole family can enjoy the retro setting bring you back to being a kid and playing games at the arcade. it is a sweet and touching stroy that teaches kids it's ok to just be you
B004GHNIRK|5.0|teaches how life can be lived without all the extraa............ things and simple and humble life.<br />i love it very much
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Again what can I say, this is a 4 star movie for me and one of my favourite James Garner movies and the fact that it was filmed alongside the actual Grand Prix season was amazing. This could not be filmed this way nowadays and I doubt they (The Studio's) would let the stars participate as much, as it would be considered to dangerous and expensive (Insurance) in this day and age! I read recently that this part was offered to his friend Steve McQueen first but he turned it down for some reason and suggested James Garner for the part which I hope is true but either way Mr Garner played a great part and deserved all the accolades that came from his part in this film.<br />David T. (Australia)
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was unsure of this Bond film at first, but after re-watching it I now realize it is my favorite of all time!  It doesn't have that classic Bond feel like even Casino Royale had, but that is why I liked it so much.  It is changing the game.  There are a lot of action movies out there now and Bond is definitely staying competetive.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|love this show I did not start watching it when it started I just started to watch it in the last couple weeks and can not get enough of it.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Its A good movie for kids, funny and very well made!  My kids like to watch it over and over, I found myself doing the same with them.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Charles Darwin was a kid who left everything and everyone he knew behind because he wanted to know more.  About the real world in which he lived.  He left for 5 years for overt curiosity and probable overweening arrogance.  He knew there had to be more.  And, he was right.<br />He would have won on Jeopardy.<br />Read it.  It is still what everybody's talking about.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|Completely absorbing, an amazing read from cover to cover. Paolo Bacigalupi has created a completely enveloping world which grabs onto you and won't let go....
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I love Sandberg's perspective. She lays out her argument with numbers and anecdotes but does so in a balanced way. Men are not at fault here. Women also must take some of the blame in developing a culture where men dominate the corporate structure.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|I saw this at the local movies when it came out and I remember thinking WTF.  That was a lot of fun
B001TM14VC|5.0|Oldie but a goodie! Watch at least every other year. A great (B) movie,so get some popcorn and watch this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I gave this rating because once I started playing it was hard for me to quit.<br />I would definitely recommend this game!
B003KK65KG|3.0|Lacking her usual  excitement over what will happen next. I found it a bit boring compared with her earlier novels'
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Enjoyed this one! I don't remember it enough now to give it a proper review because now it has been so long since I seen it!
B0042UEU8M|3.0|Good story but just not my thing. Daughter loved it wife loved it Ill pass the next time for sure.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is awesome<br />Hope you read cuz it's sad story in most parts tell all your friends about  bye
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Yup put it up there with Wedding crashers and other good movies. Hard to eat popcorn when you are laughing. I would rent or buy this movie and there are no late fees!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|It was a good story, but just a little much on the violence.  The constant explosions of blood when someone was shot were not very believable.  I did like the end when Django got his revenge on all the people who had mistreated him.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Got some action got lucy lue has some other fellers and swords and guns and russel crow. I would like the time I invested in this movie back. lol
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Show is ok. Not too bad to watch. Girl is cuter than her enemies \\"the cool kids\\". Take it for a spin, you could always just shut it off.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works great, got it for monster hunter 3 ultimate, it makes a lot of diference and is a must for those underwater missions, feels like a completely new 3ds xl, it came with the battery, shipping takes a while, patience is a must  too.
0517543052|3.0|Damage to the cover upon opening. Other than that I love the book, just with it had been in NEW condition as stated.
B0001I562I|5.0|Great gift idea.  This was for a relative and they loved getting it.  Don't know much more than that as for how good it was but they liked it.
B000059MEL|5.0|Very impressed with the vinyl.  \\"Short circuit\\" is very different on vinyl. It has a larger dynamic range. \\"Too long\\" has a very, very warm and natural sound. The album is split onto two micro cut vinyls. They are not 180 gram and kinda pressed sloppy.  However, the audio is phenomenally great. I'm really glad I purchased this. I'm a big fan of this album and and the album art is nice. The rest of the tracks are great and have that warm sound that vinyl produces.
B00004RF83|5.0|Great gift idea.  This was for a relative and they loved getting it.  Don't know much more than that as for how good it was but they liked it.
B0070UFMOW|1.0|fragmented product. you need additional accessories to use it, but I will not go into details. bulky. battery dead - although it says it charges&#34; - I for one could not use it even a single second without a usb cable/the bulky dead rat powered desktop amplifier companion. I doubt I will get one that works. Surprisingly, there's no return policy in place, you can return it and reorder it. piece of junk. documentation very poorly made. waste of time.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Great gift idea.  This was for a relative and they loved getting it.  Don't know much more than that as for how good it was but they liked it.
B003MOHX8S|4.0|This album of instrumental music is a great listen.  You can feel the action and imagine the movements as the music moves along.
6305535264|5.0|Great gift idea.  This was for a relative and they loved getting it.  Don't know much more than that as for how good it was but they liked it.
B004PUG7MG|3.0|This is an OK album, nothing to get excited about. I think she makes a better songwriter than singer and should go in that direction.
B000M53GM2|5.0|Great gift idea.  This was for a relative and they loved getting it.  Don't know much more than that as for how good it was but they liked it.
B002PYW26Y|3.0|A good film to watch. I wish they had done more with it but I guess the target audience puts limits on what goes in a movie.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Great gift idea.  This was for a relative and they loved getting it.  Don't know much more than that as for how good it was but they liked it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|There are many times sequals fall flat and you know it, and there are many sequals that seem to fit seamlessly into the first story, not losing any continuity along the way. This is one of the latter,and I am glad of it. Toy Story 3 is a wonderful ending to a great three part story and worth every accolade given. Woody and Buzz find themselves seemingly forgotten as Andy grows up and is getting ready for college. In the rush for him to get ready, Andy is reminded he still has his toys in the chest in his room and must decide what to do with them. When he starts packing them away to take to the attic, he rediscovers Woody and Buzz and decides to take Woody with him to College while the other toys, Buzz included will go to the attic. His sister, is also clearing out some things to donate to a day school and needs some help. In the process, the bag of toys being sent to the attic gets mixed up and mistaken for trash by their mother. Woody attempts to help his friends escape and while he is a little late, discovers to his relief that they have freed themselves but is appalled to learn they have decided to go to Sunnydale, believing that they had been thrown away. Woody's attempt to talk them out of it comes to an abrupt end when the car door slams and he is trapped and going to Sunnydale with them. When they arrive, they are met by Lotso Hugging Bear who assures everyone they have made the right choice and that they are in a better place. Woody however, chooses not to remain and leaves in a huff while the beautiful world the others have entered rapidly turns sour when they find the kids in the room they have been assigned are too young and too rough. Things get worse when they discover Lotso is no one's friend and rules Sunnydale with an iron hand. On his way home, Woody is found and rescued by a liitle girl and taken to her home and it is there he discovers what really happened to his friends and he is torn between trying to get back before Andy leaves or rescuing hisfriends from their terrible predicament. He chooses to go back and finds a way to free his friends resulting in an effort worthy of &#34;the Great Escape&#34;. Freeing Buzz, however has a seriously funny side complication when he returns in Spanish mode and in the midst of their escape starts to romance Jessie the Cowgirl. The escape is nearly thwarted by Lotso, but Big Baby throws him into the trash and manages to pull Woody in as well and when the truck comes all are taken to the dump and Woody and Buzz face their greatest menace ever When Lotso betrays them and leaves them behind to perish. This is a bit darker than the other two, but the story is amazing. A great cast and great effects makes this well worth watching, and it's a keeper!
B009CPGZFS|5.0|Coouldn't wait for the next season.  I was watching  non-stop.  Totally worth the price charged for this season.  Thank you for making viewing possible.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Of a good finale as the trio, Ron, Hermione, and Harry start the hunt for the horcruxes and to try to prevent Voldemort from getting his hands on the Hallows, three very powerful artifacts mentioned in a wizarding fairytale, but found to be true. Because the Wizarding World has fallen to Voldemort the three have become outcasts with dark wizards chasing them every step of the way. Here, we have the Tale of the Three Brothers and what it means to possess the Hallows as Voldemort seeks to be the Master of Death, as Harry seeks to prevent it as they prepare for the final showdown.
1476733953|5.0|I came across Wool as it was to be part of my book discussion group to be discussed in July 2013 but read it much earlier as the author, Hugh Howey, was a visiting author held this month (April 2013)at my local library so I decided to read it to coincide with meeting the author. I wasn't disappointed I thoughly enjoyed the book even though I am not a fan of sci fi. I could relate to the characters and found myself engrossed in the novel. I have just begun reading the next one in the series named Shift. Overall, I would recommend reading this book even if like me you are not a sci fan. I can't wait for it to made into a film.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you are looking for something to just kill some time between things then this will do. I enjoy it when I take my breaks at work.
0156027321|4.0|Overall I would say I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  I thought the ending was good in that it made me think.  However the story dragged a little bit in the middle.  I guess there is only so long I can read about someone floating in the ocean.  It's worth the read though.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Sounds great on vinyl, I like that you have the option on the digital download as well.  Clearly this medium is making a comeback!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|anyone who loves Bruce will love this CD. I Bought this for my husband for birthday, loves all the songs.
B00BHO70L0|5.0|I've only seen the preview for the movie with English subtitles, but I anticipate this to be every bit as good as the original series once it is released in English sub.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read this book more times than I can count. I love how Travis and Abby are so different but perfect for each other.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Enjoyed it a lot more than the previous seasons. Faster paced and all around better plot and writing. Now I'm hooked! Which I never thought would be the case, as I've always hated zombie shows/ movies. Well done, TWD!
B005IQZB14|5.0|As  an old man, this is the first adventure I have ever read by a female author.  It was a grand experience.  She exposes us to her every sensation and fear, while she continues to amaze with her grit and insights. She struggles with an oversized pack and a huge burden of family history. She is at once, frightened and fearless.  Read this and you will feel that you have lived the Pacific Crest Trail with a courageous young lady who loves life- all life!
B000FCKC4C|2.0|This story was similar to that of a child's fairy-tale; very simple, quick and easy read. Not at all what I was expecting the Alchemist to be, was looking for more complexity and felt mislead by other reviews and recommendations.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr Alexander is a renowned brain surgeon who takes the reader through a catastrophic coma that he experienced in which his his fore-brain failed to function for almost a week.  He uses a lot of scientific jargon, but is very careful to explain himself so that any reasonably well educated person can follow. He could not do less without losing the respect of his peers. One simply cannot question the authors credentials or sincerity.  On the other hand, He reiterates the same visions of  white clouds and meeting acquaintances that have been reported by others having near-death experiences for centuries. Maybe it is true, but what troubles me is that he (as with the others) only mentions humans in Heaven. It is true, his personal angel has butterfly wings, but there is no mention of any other life in his Heaven.  If one truly believes in God and Heaven, then you have to accept that God is and is in everything!  the Author argues that everything is made up of the same elements and, therefore, we are really no different than anything else in Creation.  Then, how  come there are no gold finches or beautiful big pine trees in Heaven?
B00881PTRC|4.0|Fun game! Reminds me of the days growing up. Love the little animations. I hope they expand upon this game.
B008CYDDWI|4.0|If your a horror fan you likely know and love this movie. Jeffery Combs is amazing as Dr. Herbert West. The blu ray is a great steal at $9.99. However though overall a good viewing experience, certain scenes were not cleaned up in the transfer to HD. Still well worth owning.
B009FZFONO|4.0|There is a lot more people being killed and conflicts between the living than problems with the walkers. It is starting to get to soap opera status.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|EASY TO USE<br />Convenient way to read Bible<br />I love the audio choice for reading, and the options they give
B009X2CUYA|3.0|I found that the start of the book was somewhat contrived in language and grammar. There seemed to be too much use of alliteration and descriptive prose. As the story progressed it seemed that the author settled down and gained confidence. I generally enjoyed it but it was perhaps overlong and repetitive. I do like her books and will continue to buy more.
034580404X|1.0|Stupid concept and a waste of my time and money.  I can't even find anybody to give the stupid books to.
0141345659|5.0|I loved the main character. The lovestory was not predictible and the ending excelent. It's my firts book from John Green and I'm waiting to read the rest of the colection.
1400063515|5.0|&#34;All swans are white&#34; was an unassailable truth up until the discovery of Australia — it was something everyone knew to be a fact. But it was neither true nor a fact. All it took was the sighting of one black swan in the new southern continent to turn the Old World upside down on its head. Taleb, a cagey Lebanese-born philosopher and thinker, has grabbed onto the &#34;black swan&#34; as a synecdoche for an abruptly appearing, totally unexpected event which has a great impact on the world, but for which the world conjures up ex post facto explanations which makes it all sound reasonable and predictable. Sure, antiseptic procedures for doctors sound reasonable today, but the black swan Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was imprisoned in a mental institution by the head of his hospital, even after his procedures had saved over a hundred-thousand women in Vienna from dying in childbirth! I have made a vocation of seeking out such black swan innovators, both those like Semmelweis whose contributions grace history books and some whom I have been fortunate to meet and or converse with, such as Immanuel Velikovsky, Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Joseph Newman, Andrew Joseph Galambos, Doyle Philip Henderson, and Kaisu Viikari. Those that I have met only through books constitute a longer list, and I will mention their names in case you wish to look up their contributions as outliers in their unique fields of innovation and discovery: Alfred Korzybski, Rudolf Steiner, Gregor Mendel, Owen Barfield, Anastasia, Barbara McClintock, Carlos Castaneda, Jane Roberts, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Watzlawick, Gregory Bateson, Richard Feynman, Robert Axelrod, and Thomas Paine, among others. It is only fitting that I add the author of this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, to the list of black swans I have met through books because his coined phrase black swan will echo down the halls of time, much as Tom Kuhn's word paradigm which he rescued from obscurity and pumped new life into in 1962.<br />In New Orleans in the Fall of 2005, my wife and I lived through the Black Swan known as Katrina. It appeared overnight and left in its wake a devastated metropolitan area. How did we react to Katrina? We restored our home on the West Bank and our fourplex apartments in New Orleans. I had ridden out Hurricane Betsy about 40 years before Katrina and seen the devastation left behind then, and I had heard of the Great Flood of 1927, about 40 years before Betsy. Knowing something about batting averages, it seems to me that the City of New Orleans needs a catastrophe about every 40 years. The first generation after the catastrophe remembers it and expects another catastrophe like it every year. The second generation only hears about it and never expects one, but the new third generation forty years later gets shook up by a new and unexpected catastrophe and the cycle starts over. I doubt that Taleb would accept my simple baseball metaphor of batting average for predicting a city's experience with catastrophes, but I offer it in the absence of any other explanation. It can bring a certain measure of comfort to those who might otherwise spend Spring through Fall of every year worrying about another Katrina.<br />Here's how Taleb describes the dynamics of Black Swans and what might qualify as a Black Swan:<br />[page viii] Just imagine how little your understanding of the world on the eve of the events of 1914 would have helped you guess what was to happen next. (Don't cheat by using the explanations drilled into your cranium by your dull high school teacher.) How about the rise of Hitler and the subsequent war? How about the precipitous demise of the Soviet bloc? How about the rise of Islamic fundamentalism? How about the spread of the Internet? How about the market crash of 1987 (and the more unexpected recovery)? Fads, epidemics, fashion, ideas, the emergence of art genres and schools. All follow these Black Swan dynamics. Literally, just about everything of significance around youmight qualify.<br />This combination of low predictability and large impact makes the Black Swan a great puzzle; but that is not yet the core concern of this book. Add to this phenomenon the fact that we tend to act as if it does not exist! I don't mean just you, your cousin Joey, and me, but almost all &#34;social scientists&#34; who, for over a century, have operated under the false belief that their tools could measure uncertainty.<br />Taleb's fort&eacute; is the world of finance and economics, and his advice is that no advice from anyone can predict Black Swans. He even gives you a way of discovering this truth he offers, an operation that many of you can easily perform to ascertain how oblivious the best informed experts in the world are to Black Swans.<br />[page xviii] . . . the applications of the sciences of uncertainty to real-world problems has had ridiculous effects; I have been privileged to see it in finance and economics. Go ask your portfolio manager for his definition of &#34;risk,&#34; and odds are that he will supply you with a measure that excludes the possibility of the Black Swan — hence one that has no better predictive value for assessing the total risks than astrology (we will see how they dress up the intellectual fraud with mathematics). This problem is endemic in social matters.<br />Do you begin to feel as if a rug has been pulled out from under you, causing you to lose your level of comfort in the world? If not, you have not yet understood the problem, and you may gently pull yourself away from this review, dear Reader, and return to your favorite illusory world where Black Swans don't exist, where the world is uniform, slowly changing, and where manufacturing gasoline pumps will always be a prosperous business to invest in. You and I live in a world where no Black Swan will suddenly pop up to make oil a useless black goo best left underground.<br />Taleb begins the meat of the book talking about Umberto Eco's Antilibrary, which he defines as the unread books on the shelves of Eco's 30,000 volume library, the research volumes. Like my visitors, people would come into Eco's home and notice the size of his library and ask him how many of the books he's read, as if that were the sole reason for owning a library, to read every book. That concept of antilibrary goes to the heart of Taleb's profession as he deems himself to be a skeptical empiricist.<br />[page 2] Let us call an antischolar — someone who focuses on the unread books and makes an attempt not to treat his knowledge as a treasure, or even a possession, or even a self-esteem enhancement device — a skeptical empiricist.<br />Before we actually reach the first page of Chapter One, we know all about Taleb in a thumbnail sketchy way so that we are well-prepared for the main course which will flesh out the menu explanations he has shared with us during his impressive Prologue. I don't know about you, but I wanted to order and digest every meal on his menu and was well-satisfied with my dining experience with him as I closed the book.<br />I cannot tell all the many things I learned in this book, nor do I intend to try. We live in a world full of people who believe that eventually computers will figure out everything and predict everything which is going to happen. These are people who have not read or digested the material of this book, which is indeed an eponymous Black Swan among books and as such will likely be unread and misunderstood when read. Gregory Bateson, a Black Swan among thinkers and an eminent cyberneticist, was asked once by a student, &#34;Professor Bateson, how will we know when computers have reached the level of human intelligence?&#34; Bateson thought for a minute and answered, &#34;We will ask the computer a question, and it will answer, 'That reminds me of a story.'&#34; As Taleb writes on page xxvi of his Prologue, &#34;Ideas come and go. Stories stay.&#34; Computers will never answer any questions with stories, andthus will never provide anything lasting, but Nassim Nicholas Taleb has provided a monument to his skeptical empiricism which will stand for all time to come. He explains to us what it means to be human in an inhuman world and how to survive given the reality of Black Swans.

B0067EKY7M|1.0|WARNING: Contains plot spoilers.<br /><br />The only reason this doesn't get 0 stars is because Kristen Scott Thomas is pretty funny. Everyone else in the movie is basically eye candy. Initially, my husband thought that the soldier was lying and was actually married or something. That would have helped make the story more believable. However, there was no valid reason for the choice she makes at the end. I said, \\"At least she knows the soldier's good in bed. For all she knows, Fred could have erectile disfunction!\\"<br /><br />OK, so I'm being tongue in cheek about this. That's clearly not how you choose a lifelong partner. The point is, the movie showed us NO reason that either man would make a good partner, and they didn't present her as anything but gorgeous either. They didn't even show the characters spending any real time together.<br /><br />I was glad they made the point (vaguely) about cultural relations and the fact that the Yemen people did not necessarily want anything to change or be saved---at the end, Fred did say he'd consult the locals moving forward. But overall, the premise was crazy from the beginning, and my decision to suspend disbelief for the sake of the romance was thwarted by the lack of any plot development in terms of romance.
B00005JLEU|5.0|One of the best Miyazaki films ever! I loved watching this movie with my kids and watching them realize the important life lessons and moral choices cleverly hidden in the film. I guarantee that Spirited Away is a movie every age will enjoy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that, with my Amazon Prime account I can have seamless integration of my programs, apps and information no matter what electronic device I am using. I am so tired of paying additional fees from other companies to use my purchases throughout my house. Thank you, Amazon.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't believe all the features and versions included in this app for free. I have downloaded several versions onto my android devices so I can use them when I'm not around phone signal or wifi but I just use this all the time. Thank you for this resource and all the time that has been dedicated to making this app free. What a blessing.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Would you believe that a 67 year old had not read this before? Well that is true. When our book club selection was March by Geraldine Brooks, I found that I wanted to know the character March created by Louisa May Alcott. So I downloaded LW to my Kindle and found it a great read, if not a bit moralizing and didactic for me, but perfect for the girls of the 1800's toward whom it was directed. Glad I took the time to connect with this wonderful old book. I did use the Kindle dictionary feature a number of times throughout.
078322611X|5.0|This is such a classic and one that needs to be watched again every now and then. Charming. Inspiring. Kid friendly. Just a great movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The plot moves so quickly, almost too quickly.  They did a great job of summarizing the events that occur over a couple of decades in three short seasons.  By the end, you feel the tragedies as if they were from your own family.
B002JI94J4|1.0|Pete Sayek's review was phenomenal. The level of detailed analysis shows a keen awareness of what should be contained within this BD disc. Anyone with an appreciation for what this movie should be....take heed.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Addicting but problems with getting free gems doesn't seem to work. Should get that part fixed and then it would definitely rate 5 stars.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it seems a bit more sturdier than the original one that was shipped with my kindle.  Works great with the new accelerated adapter.
1452115567|5.0|This book was everything I had hoped! The pictures are precious, zany, amazing, clever, and so much more. I can't wait to meet Maddie and Theron on the book tour. Love you guys!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|This album came out way before Layne Stayley died, and I loved this side project just as much if not just as much as Alice in Chains. This was one supergroup that if Layne was still with us, they would have been a stellar band. This album is one of the best rock records ever in my opinion. I am so glad it was reissued because previously it was very rare to find a copy and if you did it cost waaaaay to much. Buy this album, its a must have for any rock fan.
0062059963|2.0|I never understood why in the first book America volunteered to be in the selection in the first book and then she spent the whole book complaining that she didn't want to be there.  If she had been forced then it would have been different.<br /><br />This book had nothing, America's relationship with Maxon went downhill and it never picked back up.  She still doesn't know what she wants, when I don't understand why she would still want her ex, just like I don't understand why he's still in the series???  I don't even like the Prince anymore.  The love triangle only works when it's 2 guys that are in love with the same girl, not when it's one boy in love with 2 girls.<br /><br />I kept hoping that America would get kidnapped by the rebels or we would hear more about the war, but this is the bachelor without the final rose, cool dates, or any action with the rebels besides they hide in some rooms while they attack again.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has a great story line, tons of comedy, and is very entertaining. It's also a great movie for both girls and boys. Would highly recommend to any parent.

B009IUH1N2|3.0|Starts off Very simple...takes a long time to build up difficulty level...stopped playing and removed after a couple of hours. This is a good book...glad i bought it when it was free...WISH I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW PURCHASES BEFORE BUYING...SO I DON'T WASTE MY TIME AND/OR MONEY
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Hands down on of Hitchcock's best and my favorite of his films. First let me say that this 50th anniversary looks AMAZING on blu-ray. I never would have guessed that a film this old could look this incredible!! It was literally like rediscovering an old favorite a film I have loves since I was a kid. The famous crop duster and Mount Rushmore scenes a breathtaking, Hitch himself would have been stunned I think with the depth of the visuals.<br /><br />Now for those of you who have never seen this master piece (#40 on AFI's top 100 films list, and #4 among thrillers) then you need to make a point to see it, soon. A masterful use of Hitchcock's MacGuffin, or a device that drives the plot but either is never fully revealed or does not exist. Akin to the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction or the &#34;Secret Plans&#34;--but of what we are never told- in more films than can be named. I won't say more for the sake of those who have never seen the film but suffice to say that everything in this film is smartly and tightly done, from the performances, to the cinematography and as goes with out saying the direction of one of the, if not the greatest director Hollywood has ever seen. Do yourself a huge favor and don't miss out on this one, it should be on every bucket list.

B000V39KDO|5.0|Here we have the epitome of a film where one should not over think, sit back, don't ask a ton of questions and enjoy. 300 is a film where over thinking or over asking is a huge mistake. The visuals are amazing and only 3 parts of your body are needed to enjoy this film, your heart, your gut and your eyes. If you want depth of plot you are in the wrong house, Shakespeare is two doors down!<br /><br />It's really simple bring the there items above, switch the rest off and get away for a couple of hours. This is not to say 300 is plotless but the very simple idea of free men fighting against a tyrant is what has made the tale of the 300 Spartans and the Battle of Thermopylae resonate for over 2000 years. It is basic visceral, patriotic, saber rattling that can be applied to the US Revolution, the French Revolution, WWII or to any time free men fought against tyranny. It's not some deep story with a thousand sub plots or side stories, it just around two hours of over the top bravado and butt whooping with some of the best stylized visuals, pulled directly from the comic on which it is based as if the comic alone was used as a storyboard. And in this day and age a little old fashioned bravado can be fun!!!
B009KHCT94|4.0|I have been thinking about watching this one for a while now but never got around to it until this morning. I considered it by it's trailer and concept as at best a bit of low-brow entertainment. My father has an odd weakness for cheesy B-Movies and apparently I became afflicted. Not out of any kind of appreciation of them as an art form but just as a light-hearted way to pass the time. That's what I thought this was going to be and for the most part it is. It is definitely a fun movie.<br /><br />What I wasn't expecting was any kind of depth to the characters. Most were shallow representations of several political figures and ideologies. But the main characters of the film definitely have their own life separate from the camp. The Renate Richter character played by Julia Dietze is obviously the primary character and is well developed (as is Ms. Dietze, good gracious...). Anyway.<br /><br />Renate's growth in the film is a good example of a common problem with followers of a chosen belief system. They know what it is they are told and are reasonably versed in the information that they are provided (ie. propaganda). However, once exposed to the unfiltered record, in this case the unedited version of a film, some begin to see how childlike their belief in their system is. In fact, Renate's character was itself very childlike in the beginning of the story. As her character's understanding matures so does her personality and it creates a 3 dimensional character. It in fact moves away from a single minded belief system into an experience based ideology that's more personal expression than regurgitation of the opinion of others.<br /><br />Christopher Kirby's James Washington has his own development. You get the impression that he took himself for granted until it was taken from him. By fighting to get back what he lost he obviously finds his individuality and a deeper appreciation of his own self. What started as an almost stereotypical character (ironically) subtly builds a strong dignity. Nice.<br /><br />It would be very easy to miss these underlying lessons and simply accept the candy coating that is the movie's surface lampooning.<br /><br />Give this one a chance. Good character development, excellent special effects, good story delivered at a good pace, and a lot of dark tongue in cheek humor. A well done little film that knows what it is and is better because of it.ds a strong dignity.

B00AEFY0F2|1.0|This movie is extremely overrated!!  UGH. I could have written this movies.  No imagination at all.  If they were to do a sequal it would have the removal of the Berlin Wall, the space ship blowing up, 9/11 etc.  Waste of time
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|The original Start Trek series can't be given enough credit for the mega-industry science fiction has become.  This was, essentially, the birthplace of it all.  Star Trek took a genre that used to be reserved for kiddie shows and Saturday morning cartoons and made it something adult, intelligent, and creative.<br />Looking back now, of course, we all chuckle at the low-budget effects, the &#34;mod&#34; alien outfits, the occasional &#34;Shatner&#34; moment...but really, it all adds to the series' charm.  The second season might be my favorite, it certainly hold some of my favorite episodes - but it deserves recognition for one epic achievement above all others: in Season 2, Star Trek learns to laugh at itself.  And we are honored to join the fun.<br />When introducing a newbie to Star Trek, I almost always start with Season 2's &#34;The Trouble With Tribbles.&#34;  (And usually follow with the Season 1 ep. &#34;City on the Edge of Forever.&#34;)  This was an era when people were hopeful and optimistic about our future, and Star Trek showed faith in humanity, and in our ability to become something better.  It's worth falling in love with this show, just for that feeling of hope.<br />In my sci-fi loving heart, this show will never be equaled.  It's the creme de la creme, and it will forever...forgive me, but I've just got to say it...&#34;Live long, and prosper.&#34;

B007URVZJ6|5.0|A book on how to build a book for kindle by the Amazon Kindle Publishing Platform. Why would I need to go anywhere else. The information I wanted to know about formatting and some of the guidelines were in this book. I can be assured I am getting what Amazon wants and expects in an eBook. Straight from the horses mouth so to speak. Love it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love love this game hope they continue making new rooms as it is fun listening to the different accents as well as music
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Ramin is an absolutely fantastic Phantom!<br /><br />The production of Masquerade was very well done, too. Cameron Macintosh went above and beyond!
B00BJNHACS|5.0|this is a fun game and it will challenge your motor skills, plus its hard to put down. and the tracks and the hard at some point.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|My only disappointment was my incorrect assumption this was a full stage production. However, even in its concert setting, the acting and stage work is really well done.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I've never played this type of game before, so I can't compare to similar types, but this is cute & fun!! Thanks.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I had a hard time with this one and part of the reason why is that I hate love triangles. I have a hard time understanding someone who lets two different people believe they have the significant place in your heart. However, I have to hand it to Ms. Cass because the way she writes this, I found myself rooting for BOTH Maxom and Aspen. America irritated me with her whishy washy affections and I still have problems with \\"The Bachelor\\" style of dating we have to endure. I finished this feeling confused and and with more questions than answers. On the brighter side, I did like the greater exploration of this Dystopian world and America's desires to make changes. If this series sticks with that, I think I will enjoy the next installment, especially because this one ended on yet another cliff-hanger!<br /><br />[...]
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I read the first book because it was reccommended to me by Amazon, and although I didn't think it was outstanding, I figured I'd read the second as well. There is a lot more action and intrigue in this book, and the world of Illea becomes much richer and more interesting. The other competitors in the selection gain more facetime, and therefore more personality, The love triangle finally feels like a true dilemma for America ( unlike in the first novel when Maxon was a romantic hero and Aspen was just a whiny kid) all in all, this was a fun, easy, quick read for any Suzanne Collins/Meg Cabot fan.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved this book as much as I loved the first in the series, Pillars of the Earth. I didn't want to read it too quickly because I didn't want it to end.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Def want to see what happens next in the story line here.  Make John Carter 2 please! It was one of my favorite sic-fi movies of the past couple years.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Good to rent. I do not recommend a buy, unless your a fan of Tarentino.  The story was creative. One of Foxx's best performances.
B00947N6D8|5.0|We saw this in the theatre and I knew I would be buying this for my kids because it is one of those movies you want to watch over and over. Story and characters were well developed and the animation was amazing. Highly recommend.
B009GYSQV6|4.0|As a big CC fan I enjoyed this album.  I will say this seems to be a bit more mellow than the other two albums out.  My favorite track is &#34;Insulin&#34; which has that classic gritty Crystal Castles vibe.  Also, the name of the last track escapes me but it definitely doesn't belong on this CD.  It's entirely too slow.  I would have preferred a remix of something already on there than that poop.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I loved Columbo growing up. This set contains all episodes and movies. The quality of the DVD's are excellent. It will take a long time, but I plan on viewing it all.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. Throughout the book, the story kept me interested and glued to every page. Took me 4 days to read this book, quickest time I've read a book in a while.. I read it that quick, because I didn't want to put it down and I wanted to find out what happened next.

B0047CPB42|4.0|Capture , detail,  .belief, this book has it all . The characters are well defined that allows the reader to feel the deep sadness and longing a person can feel. The writer has created a wonderful paradox of not only the character but the readers own mind can be deluded . Great read for the analytical
B002P79KAC|5.0|It's A Very Good Program, To just escape the problems of the day.  Very well written, and acted.  Thank  You
B0031RDVNM|3.0|I really enjoyed this book I loved the writers style . Some parts were quiet political that went over my head but anyone into global politics would really appreciate the detail of the writer. The plot and execution of its delivery were page turning. One to be read again and again
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie and recommend it to everyone!  It's smart, sweet, funny, and ultimately - like &#34;The Grinch&#34;, Gru's heart grows bigger and bigger with every scene.  WATCH THIS MOVIE several times to catch all the amazing humor!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was told to read the book instead of watch the show and I wasn't disappointed.<br />Would highly recommend this book to others.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Pros: Price<br />Cons: Doesn't work<br /><br />I have a small living room and wanted to be able to use my kinect.  I bought this with high hopes.  It failed to let my use my Kinect any closer then normal, would cause the Kinect to pickup random movements at times, and made it hard for the Kinect to see the floor so that it could setup correctly.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|if you like seek and find and mysteries you will love this game! very intriguing and just difficult enough to keep you hooked.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|Unless you look closely, you cannot see that there is Asian writing on the cover.  I ordered this not knowing, and had to return it.  It would be nice if something in the description stated that it was in another language!!

B00499QUK2|4.0|I've always been a big Sherlock Holmes fan.  I'm glad there are modern day series about the detective.  I love how in the universe of the show NO ONE has heard of the Sherlock of the books and movies.  Well directed, love the photography of London, well written too.  The interaction of Homes and Watson is a lot of fun.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game.  The complainers should be glad to be able to play for free.  A few glitches, but that's gonna happen when the game is constantly being upgraded.  It's a challenge to get ahead, but if it were easy it would be boring.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you are a fan of Harry Bosch, then this novel brings him back in his capacity of a tenacious, seasoned cop who bucks the system to uphold the rights of the victim. It was a great read and had a fast moving plot. What a treat to have Harry on the job again as colorful and steadfast as always.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|The beginning was a lot like downton Abby. Very interesting how the English people and their servants operated and their loyalty
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read the book after hearing about the movie. I know I'm late but it is an amazing book.<br />Must read the rest of the series
B00992CF6W|1.0|This was a waste of money since my daughter couldn't download it.  My virus blocker caught a virus.  From a web search, it appears to be a known problem; not surprising since Minecraft is so popular right now.  I would think Minecraft would be addressing it and reaching out to all of those who purchased it, but I have not received any correspondence and their support system is only forums and articles - you can't reach a person.  Waste of money and frustrating for my kid.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great review of history inner-spaced with characters you care about.  You get a perspective of the events which shaped the world from people of different contexts, British, American, German, and Russian.  Fast paced, brutal at times but it reflects the realism of what occurred.  We know how the story ends but after reading Follett we know why.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Case has a great cover of the movie. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed in buying this movie. Great quality!
B005HSGB6W|4.0|Language was hard to follow at times but was still a classic to read.  Recommend it for anyone looking for something diifferent.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love. playing this game on facebook and I'm glad they now have it on apps. I can suggest that the screen can be enlarged by using fingers to open the screen bigger then the screen can be. slid
B004SBULWE|4.0|I use this on my phone and my Kindle Fire and it does a great job of clearing old data. My husband uses it also and we recommend it to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed every moment, it made me laugh and cry so much!<br />It was a pleasent surprise, I wasn't expecting the ending!
B009IUH1N2|5.0|It had so many different levels that engages you in and I could stop playing infill the game was over.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Provides a wonderful narrative of the chaos that happens every single day within small to large IT departments while providing process advice and solutions to fixing the bottlenecks that are slowing your and your team down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surf. While I am not very good at it, I keep coming back to See if I can get a better score. The controls are simple. The menu is easy to navigate. This game is great. Perhaps I will beat it at some point.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|works well need ed replace ment. customer service very helpful and very polite. like using kindle fire and going online for help
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game it is easy and lots of fun to play. I am enjoying this game a lot, I would recommend it to others.
B005K17RU0|5.0|an excellent up to date accurate source for weather if home or on the road traveling. love it. u<br />se it everyday
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Although it did take me a while to get into the book initially (I left too many days inbetween picking it up), once I did, I couldn't put it down. I loved the surprise ending!
B001U7WUW8|5.0|Great album.  Great sound and not damaged during transport.  If you buy vinyl this one is one you should have in your collection.
0783116934|5.0|The Russian &#34;Silence of The Lambs&#34;. True story... Google it! Intense dogged detective never gives up the hunt for the depraved serial killer! I sort of liked the &#34;take no prisoners&#34; approach of the KGB!! Justice served quickly!<br />If you liked TSOTL, you'll like this.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I found a new favorite show. Elementary is well written, fast paced and great character portrayals after recently seeing my first episode, I ordered the pilot. The show was great, and the quality of the download was crystal clear HD. I will use the amazon service again. Highly recommended!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I'm new to ebay and this takes me there and all around with ease and intrigue.  What a fun place!  What an efficient app!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The plot twist between the two main characters left something to be desired. Overall the story is great. Looking forward to the next book.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Nope.  This finely crafted presentation sets one adrift in one's own imagination that click's sharply to reality with a gasp of awareness.  Wow.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|fits, and works.  was able to capture some old video from high school with this adapter.  yayyy.  I am pleased.
B0058VW36U|5.0|But the laugh is back.  What hysterical fun this is.  Paced to teach-as-you-go, this app is like no other.  A lot of fun!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I read books for enjoyment and to relax. I like a well planned story and well written. I don't enjoy violent  or crude books, enough of that in real life.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Got a friend retiring; we're counting down days to retirement.  Days to the birthday?  Counting them down.  Awesome little app.
B00271B752|5.0|This is one of the finest movies from the 70's He played a important role at that time, ny finest.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Amazing app!  Just follow along and stick with it.  Go at your own pace; pick your preference; repeat if you like.  Great little app.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Got turned on to his music, &#34;A Thousand Kisses Deep&#34;, years ago. The Collection is such a &#34;steal deal&#34; if you're a fan. Not every song on every cd is a fav, but overall, I'm glad I took the leap to purchase. Can't say I could listen to that much music by any other artist, but then Leonard Cohen is unique; poet, artist, singer, musician, storyteller.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|A true tale of aging and coming of age.  Of awareness and choices.  Of relationships.  All seamed together in a fine tapestry.  A truly engaging story that gives one pause.  I watched it three times in that 48 hour rental period.  I'd watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Makes you really feel for what they have to endure.  What a horrible thing to go through.
B00B52F278|5.0|This last year of Spartacus brought everything together and provided a very satisfying and beautiful ending to a great series.  Just an amazing accomplishment by the writers of this great series.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is my favorite game on my kindle the only thing bad about it is that you have to buy create your own robot.
B004IPPINW|5.0|A very good read. An interesting way to write a book, a completely different perspective and very informative! I truly enjoyed this book.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is so cool! You can create your own notebooks, name them, pick a design for the cover, and create as many notebooks you want. I would like it to have your own pics for the notebook cover, but it's an awesome app.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I felt that the size difference between Tom and Jack would be hard to watch buthe scenes were very real and enjoyable.<br />This action flick was made the way movies were made when I went to them in the 40's and 50's. No bedroom scenes and long kissing scenes in other words no sex involved just a lot of action<br />I did not want this movie to end. In other words it was the best I have seen in years
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is totally what you need if you need a nice lullaby to put you to sleep or a nice loud song to wake you up. This app has its own songs for you to wake up to but you can use your own songs if you want. I like that it tells me how many hours I have to sleep when I set the alarm. Somehow I always only have 6 hours to sleep....
B0009FTXGI|2.0|Does the job of blocking light but there are two thing I dislike:<br /><br />1- The finishing is very matte. Looks like it doesn't belong to the lens.<br />2- It's too tight, very hard to put in and remove. I feel like you can damage the lens by putting so much force into it.<br /><br />I'm experiences with cameras and lenses so I know this is not suppose to be this tight.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|But better written. A story about magic and witches and vampires. Oh, and can't forget the daemons!  No teetotaling, whiny, teenagers!
1250008409|4.0|The content is excellent and the presentation is very good.  It provides a light touch to many important and serious matters.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|A good mix of stuff and Michael nails every song.  \\"Close Your Eyes\\" is destined to be a great wedding song!  \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" is so much fun and so uplifting!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun game...interesting puzzles to figure out.  Just wish it was longer, went too fast  looking forward to more room games in the future.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As a novel, it's pretty good - fast-paced, concise, and engaging. But I think it excels as a teaching tool for businesses even more than as a novel. We need more good story-based training like this.
075669812X|5.0|I saw the exact same book at Barnes & Noble for $20+ so i consider this a great bargain.  The extra toy inside was a plus.  My son loves it.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I like the color scheme and overall the entire look, haven't messed with it much on my kindle and notice some differences between the android version but those are just visual.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It doesn't work. won't let me log in at all. It freezes up every time I try to use it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I love the 007 movies and am never sorry to watch one.  Yes, some times you can almost anticipate what will happen next, but still love Daniel Craig and will always watch him as 007.  I we can’t forget “M” too, she is the best – can’t have a 007 movie without her.  I would recommend if you like these kinds of movies to watch this one too!!  Enjoy … Enjoy …
B0040I09RM|5.0|Watching SOA allows me to watch at my speed. Cuts out all the comercials and able to go back where I left off if I didn't fully complete watching a series.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved it!  I don't remember this at all but so amazing how it all worked out!  Definetly would recommend
B00BF123WG|4.0|This movie is just a little slow, but a real good movie still. Definitely worth checking out, I would recommend
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|This app is a joke, and uploads personal info for ads. I have a known password for a wifi network. So to check out this app I ran it and it gave me the wrong password. I couldn't delete this app fast enough!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|This is the best song on the whole cd but Michael still delivers a soothing medley of oldies sounds for us old but not dead senior ladies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a game for people that can think of anything.If you are verry creative you are going to win this game
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Grittier, sexier and more human. Daniel Craig is absolutely perfect in this role. This Bond is passionate about everything, not just womanizing.
1607066017|5.0|My lady went to the comic book shop and asked the girl behind the counter for a recommendation for a new graphic novel or comic for me. She threw out some descriptive words like, 'female protagonist' and 'colorful' and 'unusual' and this is what the girl handed her. ;) DGF (dear girlfriend) then surprised me with Vol. 1 and I've been hooked ever since. I love the story and the characters, the unusual angles and narrative strategies. I love how the series starts, how funny and irreverent and silly it gets, while still having all these death defying moments. I love the characters, and how well they're sketched out in so few words. I can hardly believe this is the same guy who wrote Y:the last hetero male wank fantasy. Maybe its about the collaboration? Perhaps its just the right story for me? I dunno. Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised and I absolutely LOVE this series. To put it mildly, I wasn't a fan of Brian K. Vaughn previous to this, having gotten through Vol. 1 of Y:The Last Man (you can see my review on that if you'd like to argue about how much of a sucking pile of suckage that one was) Needles to say, I now feel like maybe things just went terribly awry there, perhaps he was younger or didn't know what he was doing or was under the influence of bad narrative devices. Who knows and who cares. I'm now a huge fan because I absolutely ADORE this series. I can't even decide wether I'm more excited about seeing Alana's tits (Ooops, SPOILER ALERT) or about the made up language Marko and his parents speak that's almost Portuguese but ain't, slightly French but not quite... I super love it. All of it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is so much more to this series than &#34;walkers&#34;.  Season 3 is even better than the first two seasons. I can't get enough.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|As I said in title this album just doesn't work. It's a brave attempt and we should at least respect musicians in the latter years of their career trying to be innovative, rather than just doing the same old things and watching the money roll in but the Lou Reed Metallica combination isn't a match. Reed's spoken word style of singing is really difficult to get one's head around and prevents the music having a groove or rhythm, and some of the lyrics are really bad.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Protects my Kindle Fire from dirt and destruction. Perfect fit for the Kindle, easy zip closure, and very nicely streamlined.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I received my Anker car charger about 2 weeks ago.<br />It is small, clean, and simple. Why would it need to be complicated?<br />It has 2 USB ports, both are capable of charging almost any brand of device.<br />But, one of the ports is engineered to more efficiently charge Apple branded devices and the other port more efficiently charges Android devices. The ports are clearly marked as to which device goes where.<br />I love that I can charge my iPhone 5 and iPad Mini at the same time. I have had some single chargers that would not charge my iPad.<br />The Anker is missing any kind of charging indicator light, but the device screen can tell you that it is charging. The \\"missing\\" light is actually very nice, when driving at night. My wife has a charger that lights up the whole front seating area with a bright blue LED.<br />Overall, I'm very happy with the Anker car charger.<br />It's small, simple, does what it is supposed to do, and is priced well.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Allows me to use my Kindle Fire with A/C power. Saves the battery life for times when I am not near an electrical outlet.
0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages is one of the best relationship books I have found. I use it daily with families and marriage counseling.
0374203032|5.0|Michael Sandel is a breath of fresh air in American thinking. He is sooooo objective, logical, and non-self interested! He teaches all of us in down to earth terms. Michael Sandel for President!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This isn't as great as the first book but more like a bridge between one and three. Definitely worth the read.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Was an okay movie. I would watch again it's a little slow to get to the action.  So it rather bores you in the beginning.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Like &#34;Gone, Girl&#34;, &#34;Dark Places&#34; focuses on a strong but troubled female lead. I did not find this as complex or satisfying as Gone Girl, so if you were to chose between the two, I would recommend Gone, Girl over this.  However, this was certainly a gripping read and fun thriller.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Interesting concept for a model to gradually reveal the back story on  along walk. Good description and analysis of a difficult childhood, life and marriage and breaking the cycle and starting over.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister.  I call it a just because gift.  I was feeling generous and thought of her.  She has been wanting the dvds for a long time.
0812993845|5.0|I love just about every one of Sophie Kinsella's books. Saying that, this one pretty much goes exactly where you think it will after the first chapter. But I still loved it. It was so much fun to see all of the little in between moments, and see the direction that the characters went to get where they needed to be. I found myself feeling very sorry for poor Lottie. The only real problem I had was the men. Lorcan & Richard in particular seemed a bit 2 dimensional. While Kinsella tried to show little moments that hinted at bigger things with the men...she didn't really dive much into what they were thinking, or have them say a whole lot in my opinion. Oh, & I just wanted to PUNCH Fliss' ex! The main characters Lottie & Fliss are pretty standard Kinsella; in how they are rather air-headed and refuse to see certain attributes in themselves that others are just waiting in the sidelines to pounce on them for.  I think after everything I likes Fliss alot better than I liked Lottie. While I thought Lottie was a lot of fun at first (her movie backround music playing in her head was pretty funny), she went just a bit crazy when she broke it off with Richard. This one also didn't have the really BIG crazy OMG-WTH-are-they-DOING- make-it-STOP?!?! moment...for which I am grateful. Those are always painful to get through in any book, and I tend to skip over those during re-reads. It did have a lot of funny OH-NO moments that I do love about Kinsella's books. Overall- a bit predictable of a story line, but it will keep you smiling for sure.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I love the series and now I have the complete series.  Cannot wait until I have extra time to watch the series from the beginning.
0393064476|3.0|The core idea is interesting - how an ancient poem influenced early Renaissance writers. But it's not a fun read, there are long passages of no interest in stifling prose.<br /><br />It feels like GreenBlatt spent 6 months reading old manuscripts in European libraries, and felt he had a to cobble a 500 page book out of it by weaving a storyline that is unconvincing and uninteresting - &#34;here's what Poggio might have done, if he had been in this place at this time&#34;.<br /><br />If the subject interests you, I'd recommend instead The Science of Liberty of Tim Ferriss.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister.  I call it a just because gift.  I was feeling generous and thought of her.  She has been wanting the dvds for a long time.

B00B8WXFWE|4.0|I have a confession: I don't absolutely love this album.  Being a die-hard NKOTB fan since 1988, I have a hard time writing those words, but it's true.  That said, it's a very good album, and I enjoy listening to it.<br /><br />Originally, I listened to the samples online, and I wasn't sold.  The music sounded too manufactured, and I felt like the sound was trying too hard to match current music trends.  In fact, I was not planning to buy it, which would have been a first for me.<br /><br />However, last week, I received the CD as a gift from my husband.  I kept putting off listening to it because I just wasn't excited about it. Finally, I played it in the car today, and now that I've listened to the entire thing, I do really like it.  I like it FAR MORE than I did when I listened only to the samples.  In fact, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  In my opinion, what keeps it from earning 5 stars is there are a lot of instances where I hear auto-tune, and there's a lot more of a techno sound to it than I personally like.  Their voices are good enough that they don't need the auto-tune.  Yeah, I get that it's the trend right now, and in pop music you have to keep up with the trends, but it's not my favorite sound.<br /><br />Overall, I do give this album a very good review, and I hope it's not the last album they put together!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I played the free version even though I had already purchased the full version. It's an awesome game. I'm addicted. Also love and have played both versions off Where's My Water.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|So sick of one reality show after another.  This made for good entertainment.  Too bad it was cancelled.  Talk of bringing it back too late
159668139X|4.0|I enjoy the book. It has a lot of information that I can use to learn to weave. I can't give it a higher mark than four stars since I am a newbee at weaving. The information I receive from the book is understandable and usable. Thank you.<br /><br />John
B009O2XY12|5.0|THe whole family plays day and night.  We really enjoy the game.  We also love the Season Bubble Mania; however, there are no new islands.
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|I have played this movie several times since I got it. I love it. Hatari did indeed meet my expectations. I watched this movie years ago and loved it.  I will recommend this movie to anyone. Thank you.<br /><br />John
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Of course i wanted a happy ending. It made me so sad but i totally understand the thing we do for love sometimes don't benefit us.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|lots of fun.  even a bit addictive. really easy to play.  my kids love it too!!!!<br />hope they have another version soon.  almost done with this version.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|To bad that ten percent of the country had the courage that these men had. This book was a great read front to back.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Very very good i accidently sharpened it so much that i can cut paper i really recommend this item great.
B0047E9TRA|5.0|Really good movie -- the opening scene, was a classic..... the new version of this movie will be just as awesome
B00979CS50|3.0|Neil Young was a great songwriter until about 1979. In fact he was in rock and roll's upper pantheon (if such a thing exists).  And I think he kept it on highest level for longer than just about anyone else.  It was after Rust Never Sleeps that he went into his Real Bad Decade but then resurrected himself around 1989 with Freedon and then Ragged Glory. And in the mid nineties  came Sleeps With Angels and the underrated Broken Arrow.  But the quality songwriting was sporadic and he never really approached his great period which started with Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere in 1969.  Now, with Pychedelic Pill he reconnects with Crazy Horse - the most famous (and one would think best paid) garage band in the world.  Well - I'm a big fan of 1975's Zuma and the above mentioned Everyone Knows and the both the acoustic and electric sides of Rust where the Horse really shines.  But the 6 and 7 minute (respectively) Danger Bird and Cortez The Killer are about the limit of my tolerance for  Neil jamming with the Horse.<br />Here, we have the 16+ minute Ramada Inn and the 16+ minute Walk Like A Giant.  Shocked ?  - well the first track, Driftin' Back is TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES.  Sorry Neil - I can't listen to you noodle around in the major, minor or penatatonic scale for that long. And I'm someone that likes some of the long feedback drenched endings in the movie and cd  'Year Of The Horse.'  I love your music  Neil.  I love Zuma, Goldrush, Rust, Live Rust, Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere and I think Tonight's The Night is one of the 10 best records ever made BY ANYONE.  But I'd rather watch grass grow, my kids play or a rerun of Cheers for the eighth time than listen to this again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me at the edge of the seat. Fun read and I'm a 40 year old guy. My wife which hardly ever reads fiction could not put all three books down.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story will just hug and squeeze your heart. Beautifully done. The writing style and the emotion behind the words is haunting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie made me rush to find this book & as these things go... the book is, of course, so much better than the movie. It gives you such a better idea of why things happened.
B0047SHEAK|5.0|I was 12 years old when the original Predator came out in the 80s.  This movie does it justice far better than part 2.  It uses all of the original sound effects and music of what made the first film great and it sets up the series for great future possibilities.  The alien predator planet is a pretty awesome addition.  Can't wait for the next installment. A must watch for any fan of the original.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So ez to use, you can get to the chapters very quick and you can adjust the words to the size that is ez to read and it's aways with you!
B00881PTRC|5.0|I really like this one. graphics and animation are great! fun to play for everyone. I like that you have a choice of backgrounds
B001C4CI8A|4.0|So many have offered their opinions on the movie, provided summaries and critiques.  I will not be redundant so my review is only on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I bought the single disc Blu Ray.<br /><br />  Video Transfer:  I was surprised at how clean a transfer to Blu Ray the video was.  There was no artifacting or aliasing to be seen anywhere and no noticeable or distracting grain that I could see.  The Mbps rate generally averaged between the high teens and the mid twenties.  Color grading produced a somewhat desaturated effect.  This type of color grading is very common in movies concerning the mid East as if the mid East is devoid of color which it is not but that appears to be the American perception.  Also untrue is that the desert is always a warm, golden look as it is presented in this movie.  Also, not true but that is the color grading of this transfer.  Details in the video remain easily delineated even in the darker and shadow areas.<br /><br />  Audio: The audio is a lossless Dolby True HD and produced clear and  precise pronunciation of dialogue.  Volume levels are very good.  Most audio is across the front stage with some decent panning across the front sides and a couple of instances of panning from rear to front,  However, the rear channels generally are not used much more than ambience.  Some discreet channeling, again, mostly across the front stage.  Some sub usage but not a whole lot.  If you like the movie, the blu ray is a good one to have but, again, if you already have it in SD DVD, not sure how much of a difference you will find.<br /><br />Extras include some finished scenes that were deleted and could have easily been included in an extended edition. One of these deleted scenes is an slightly altered ending that would have done well to be included.  Other extras are commentary and story points that I haven't looked at.<br /><br /> Since I do not have it on SD DVD, I do not know of the differences between the two formats but I am sure contrast has been boosted a touch and improvement made and if you do not have the SD DVD than surely, the Blu Ray is the way to go.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.I am sure contrast has been boosted a touch and improvement made and if you do not have the SD DVD than surely, the Blu Ray is the way to go.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Was a good book but not great the happy ending felt contrived.  I never thought I would be happy to see this series finish but the end I was ready for it too be over.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|2012, now being behind us, the movie of the same year evolves into pure entertainment.  Prophecies, Biblical and otherwise, are intertwined and in some cases even suggestively linked, which  create a certain validity for the telling of the tale. Thus, even some events that are actually prophesied to take place are related in various forms.  The script has Woody Harrelson's character, played superbly by the actor who has seasoned his half-wit role from 'Cheers', run many of the major prophecies, both true and heretical, together becoming slants on the same happening.  As entertainment, the film is quite enjoyable. Solid acting plays through plausible developments.  As often as Hollywood spoofs many end time prophecies, '2012' nevertheless takes a realistic look at one scenario that was given for the world's end.  TL Farley,  author, Blast Off Rapiemur - The imminent Rapture. {I Thess. 4:14}
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie has partly a stereotypical rich girl / poor boy romance story but the really important part is that it makes you think about the implications of true love spanning decades of life.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|What a glorious wealth of words!  Very rich characters and a story abounding with twists and turns.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who is a vociferous reader looking for something different to read.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Yes, this is one of our family favorite dvds. When a two and four year old can sit still and watch a dvd from start to finish that should tell you something.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|This is a good ole fashioned jam session.  I feel like this is the epitome of this style of music and it has a great sound.
B001J20ZIA|4.0|kids love it they can watch it over and over. I let them pick which dvd they want to watch. It's keeps my five and two year old glued to screen.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter LOVE LOVE LOVES this! she plays it all the time! Thats why I gave it 5 stars! YAY!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love giving my horse treats and training and playing with her.  this game is totally awesome. I think everyone should get this wounderful game.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This series of books were an excellent read.  The story is gripping and full of intrigue all the way through.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This is one of the many applications that makes the kindle fire feel more like a full blown tablet. It allow me to open attachments from my email. I'm ready to take the training wheels off my kindle now.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Lots of technical problems with this site!  Blanks out in middle of games and<br />takes rewards earned without merit. Very disappointed with this app forthe most<br />part.
0525953728|5.0|I couldnt put it down for  the whole weekend.<br />Really cool stuff. Well written and  seemed really from the heart. You get to go on this journey with Seal  and see how it is that he came to be part of one of the most historical moments in our lifetime.<br />I did not find this book to be too overly political  or party line bashing like some critics suggest.<br />It wasnt too wordy. He really got to the point, but it was all well crafted.<br />Love it soo much, I'll be reading it again.
B00BHXUC8E|3.0|When I found the words \\"Made In Japan\\" on an item's a label, in my childhood years, there was a chance the item was going to be cheap and not of high quality, though that has obviously changed a great deal since then.  With this album, depending on your point of view, it may or may not have changed all that much.<br /><br />Whitesnake is a band that always reminds me of college and parties, which is why I rarely turn them off when they are played somewhere, even though they are not exactly a \\"cool\\" band these days.  I was surprised to see that Coverdale and his current incarnation of musicians (Whitesnake has never had a permanent line-up other than their lead singer) are still touring, although I did know that they were still recording.  The DVD from this set shows a very fired up audience in a concert hall in Tokyo being treated to a smokin' concert.  The musicianship from this band is just phenomenal.  Drummer Brian Tichy and lead guitar Doug Aldrich are fantastic; but, really, no one is worse than very good.  Liner notes from the bass player Michael Devin are a good read.  He's a smart guy, a good writer with an eye for detail; much smarter than he'd like you to believe.<br /><br />I had read about Coverdale's vocal cord injury several years ago and was curious to hear him sing.  The sad, hard truth is that he's not what he once was - this is not the Castle Donington concert in 1990.  He tends to growl things out a little in this show and I wondered whether he had a slight cold that day, but because the recording was already set to go simply had to push on.  (He is better on the acoustic songs on the Bonus Audio disc - much better in some cases.)  The vocal tracks as well as guitars and drums do NOT have an overly \\"live\\" sound - there is not much audience noise or hall ambience on this record.  In fact, other than the very, very deep low end, the sound signature is a little reminiscent of Rush's Exit Stage Left.  I wonder if there was any post-concert patching done?<br /><br />Song selection - 12 songs from all different albums.  Probably not as long of a setlist as most fans will want, but given Coverdale's vocal capabilities on this night, perhaps this was a necessity.  As others have mentioned, several songs have been tuned down a key or two.  Standout tracks - Is This Love, Here I Go Again, Still Of The Night.<br /><br />Despite these caveats, I don't regret purchasing this disc set.  I would rate it a \\"good\\" album on balance.  Some elements of it are \\"great\\" - particularly the band's contributions to the concert, the very high quality packaging, and the video quality of the DVD.  With Coverdale in better form, with these musicians, I easily could have rated \\"Made In Japan\\" 2 stars higher.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed the suspense all the way through.  The ending was perfectly appropriate given the characters.  I love a book I don't want to put down and I read this in just over a day.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The Calculator Plus is so easy to use I have recommended this to friends handy to have when out shopping.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|This is a very funny high school series very similar to the movie &#34;Easy A&#34;. I watched the first season in two days!
B0034G4P4O|3.0|I received the movie and was not very impressed by the condition if the disc. It is completely scratched up. It did manage to play through most parts, but it did catch several times and needed some help. I was disappointed by the condition of the disc compared to his it was listed.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|This game is hard to play because it's hard to see the stacking of the tiles. Tiles look like they are above the level of the tile next to them but in reality are at the same level. Very frustrating!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I just got this from a store other than Amazon, because Amazon estimated 1 to 2 months for delivery. I thought that was nuts. After reading the other reviews here I was a little worried, because I'm new to this stuff, but I downloaded the drivers from the Focusrite website and had no problems at all. I didn't even bother with the enclosed DVD, it went right from the box and into a junk drawer. It's easy to use and quiet. I'm happy.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I just love backgammon. I like the fact that you can up the level of the computer player to challenge your game. I also like the fact that you can play one or two person games.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Excellent movie. Even though there is a tragedy, most of the story is rather lighthearted and humorous.  A story of survival that keeps you engaged. Then the twist at the end makes you re-think everything you thought you knew.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|Well written and well acted. Good choice of actors. Didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Pleasantly surprised.
0802473156|3.0|While the stories and advice in this book are good, it all boils down to the simple idea of communication.  Figure out what makes you feel loved and tell your spouse.  A $15 book need not to tell you that.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I really love this game. Yes,  it's short. It's a demo so of COURSE it's going to be short! It's great fun tho so you should buy the full version! :D
B0081FO2Q4|4.0|i liked most of the songs on the album. The  A Team is the best song. very nice album a good choice
B0091VTISO|4.0|The new Conan is awesome. He has a dark side to him. Even as a young boy he was a bad A$&. The plot was good from the beginning and it kept me interested the entire movie. Granted he wasn't as \\"swoll\\" as Arnold in the origional but he more than made up for it with his attitude and cunning and spirit.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works nice wish I could get the up grade :( but it's handy for on the go or just need to get up it does the trick for me
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My daughter uses this app on her Kindle and my Ipad. She uses it quite frequently. So I give it 5 stars.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Be even better  if I could used *. pdf as fillable like I do on my computer  also be good if it had some customized templates
B0058VW36U|5.0|My kids and grand children spend many fun moments playing the game.  We will  let them order other games when they  are age appropriate.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I've loved Stephen Stills since he was called Stevie Stills, so this was a great collection.  I uploaded it pretty much as is to my Iphone so I'll have all my favorites available whenever I want them.  You'll be in heaven if you love his work.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This was a very good book but you don't hey it until the end. That's how I think it's confusing.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have a USB cord, I orded one more, When I got one, I had one more that came it.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This was a very engaging movie, with some unexpected plot twists and turns.  I would recommend this for Matthew McConaughey fans especially.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|Interesting story but gaps in following through on connections between main characters and methods on the China side of the cyber operations. Little detail on the American counter cyber attack infrastructure and counter measures.<br /><br />Enjoyable read in the classic and unique Clancy style. The story did rely too heavily on few characters and culminated too quickly with an improbable alliance between Chinese dissidents and US players. It's pace was great and it was a good yarn.
B0081I08CI|4.0|Well, with the second book done and I'm over 50% into the third book, little annoyances are building with the enormous repetition.  I have been listening to the audiobooks mostly and when I have a spare moment I sit down and read it on my kindle, but with the amount of uses and reuses, and phrases and rephrasing and yada blah, etc. I have even found myself wanting dear old Hodor to bite the dust, just so I wouldn't have to hear his voice anymore. I just want to listen to the book and let the story unfold, but the narrator keeps yelling Hodor, Hodor, Hodor. Hoooooodor in different octaves and combinations of inflection.  Yeah, that is kinda annoying after a while.<br /><br />As I had stated before I watched the first two seasons as a little assist before tackling the books, but with this installation there are many more differences in the book than the show. For that reason I am not watching the current season as I read A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Once again though G.R.R.M. does a good job crafting plots and making me like one character only to turn my back on that person before the book is done, and I guess what he eventually wants to try with me is to have me hate one individual and then develop a fondness for them later, but that won't work with me. I hold grudges, and I won't be swayed, but I will definitely admit it down the line if I eventually forgive a character.<br /><br />Just as the first book had several irritants in the details this one does the same. Sometimes a reader just wants the meat of the story and sometimes sure you can go into detail on a particular city, thing, or armor, but mostly as a reader we want the story to push forward with less junk in the way. So here is an example I came up with. This would be something like an important meeting that is supposed to take place and the people are entering the room to talk. Keep in mind it is the conversation that would be the important part:<br /><br />\\"He walked in wearing a red doublet, encrusted with jewels and diamond dust, his hair fiery blond. His chainmail soaked with blood. It was made of iron that had been ravaged from the distant land of Bernith. Bernith was known for its mining villages and the minerals never scarce. High in demand were the rubies especially and the hilt of his sword was swathed in them. His sword was made of Furanium steel, and had taken more than nine lives just this morning. On his plate armor was the traditional naked mermaid of Eldertown. Her boobs were bare and grotesquely large, too large. The mermaid was a symbol of house Gobbledy-gook, and it was a sign of good fortune to see the bare chested mermaiden upon the seas. Their house words had always been, \\"More than a handful\\". The sea that parted the two lands was named The Sea of Three Peaks. The towering jagged rocks that shot up from beneath the ocean floor as if standing guard by the Island of Murrigan. His bracers were made of solid gold, although a silly thing to do, as fighting with such an armor would slow his strokes and it was a wonder he even survived a single battle, but he loved the color and gleam of it, especially on sunny days. But it was the cold days he looked forward too. Cold, wet, stormy days where forces clashed and his gold bracers were covered in his favorite color by the end of the day. Red, the blood of his enemies. For Gunther his enemies had always been the Raiders of Turnok. They had pillaged his townsfolk for years, but tomorrow he'd eat cheese on his eggs. Eggs had been his daily staple from time to time, and every now and again he knew not how long though, he enjoyed a cup of red wine with his roasted duck. Drizzled in mango sauce and oil that would run down his beard. Throw in a couple of scallions and red pepper garnished clams, and light feathering of nutmeg and he would have his fill. Rest would come easy for him those nights, his dreams would conquer his mind with a belly full of such fine food. Normally he would dream of the sea but on those nights he would dream of women, and sometimes play-doh. It brought him back to his childhood when he had those dreams and when he would wake his face bore a smile from ear to ear.\\"<br /><br />So, as you can see these details I just gave are just over the top, and by the time you get through it all and someone says one line or greeting to the other individual, another person enters the room and...<br /><br />\\"Manx walked with a bowlegged step as his greaves glinted with each movement. His gauntlets swinging wildly as he moved across the stone floor. His boiled leather boots making not a sound as he moved, but it was his breathing that was his give away. At nearly nine and eighty, he was old, like really old. For reasons unknow chicken grease was still running down over his lips and chin from a roasted goat he ate two days past. His pure white hair the color of white, the blackness of his chest plate was the color of black. His eyes were a burning red, so red in fact they seemed almost red.\\"<br /><br />And then of course it would go into his lineage and who was his father and who was his mother and who raped who and slaughtered what village and who won or lost what tournament eons ago that is not important.<br /><br />Anyway to sum up, the stories are indeed amazing and well crafted, I just think G.R.R.M. needs to strike through many of the details in his rough draft. We get it, it looks like Medieval Times on steroids, most places are desolate and ravaged by war. Some areas have nice castles and are very beautiful. But I don't need to read five hundred extra pages to get the point.<br /><br />I will however give this book 4 stars just for the quality of the dialogue, but the pacing and the extreme misunderstanding of detail placement causes this one to lose a star.se nights he would dream of women, and sometimes play-doh.

B009P3N1GI|4.0|Good subject and Brandon always delivers a good story! Pity it was only a short novel rather than a full book!!
B0018BF1HW|5.0|My father for years has liked his music. I got him this because he still has his 1990's and never got it remaster. he loves these albums.
1595827684|5.0|Item is as described - detailed display of the art and design process of the Mass Effect universe. Recommended for anyone interested in the process behind the aesthetics of the games.
B009PHRIKE|5.0|My father always like Jean Lue ponty since i was little and still dose. I got this one for him and he loves it.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I have to admit I had never really watched a full series in my life, ever. I got introduced to the first episode of Lost and watched all the seasons in about 2 and a half weeks. I could not stop. I loved this show and of course loved Matthew Fox performance, he is awesome, dedicated, tender, sweet, great actor and very handsome!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have really really missed watching it. Hopefully he can be in more movies!!!! I wish there would have been more romantic scenes between Jack and Kate, there were just very, very few when they loved each other!!! I really did not understand why there were no more during all the seasons. Jack needed some love after all he did and sacrificed. Please come up with a little bit more of lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! or bring back Matthew Fox!!!!! :)
B002QGSYRC|2.0|I am a reader of history, but this is my first book on the Korean War and as such, I was looking for a really good introduction along the lines of &#34;Embers of War&#34; (Vietnam).  This book started out really strong with the opening salvos of North Korea's invasion of the South.  It is quickly devolving into a study of Gen. MacArthur.  I know very little about the man, but the writer's opinion of him is (excessively?) harsh.  When an author is performing what amounts to a character assassination, I think it should be well footnoted.  This section of the book, is not.  The author also, on more than one occasion paints wide swaths of how prejudiced the military was towards asians, whether Philippins or  Japanese.  I don't, for one, like these generalities and passing judgements on past generations.  We all know there were some prejudices back then, why keep making snide comments about it.  BTW, I am an American-Japanese<br />woman.  I have not finished with the book and am not sure I will unless it returns to the history of the war itself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game it is so fun we are the champions of this game love the game so Much bye
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|the middle got to be a little slow, but after reading the first one, i was so invested in the lives of the characters that i still couldn't put this one down.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a good read. The values that I embrace and expect were followed.  It was an easy book to read and enjoy.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Dragonvale is a fun memeroble expirience.I will beat anyone who dislikes this game anyway if your considering getting this app get it because its worth it.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|sometimes you get a 30,000 sometimes 100,000+ and you don't do anything different don't quite know to get the bonus bars or what they are for once you get them
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Never heard of Bonamassa until accidentally coming across concert on PBS.  Don't buy much music, but this was just too good to pass up.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Can definitely tell the influence of The Goal, good flow and easy to read.  As someone in IT industry it really hits home and has some great points of view.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Ultra clear, and the sound from the home system soundly trounced the theater.  This is the only way to see a movie...Blu-ray on a good TV (to me, at least) beats the theater hands down.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I highly recommend this product.  A great digital audio recorder in this price range.  Multiple audio formats make using it a breeze!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The new mechanics in the game continue to make the play feel fresh and fun.  This as with it's predecessors is a great puzzle game
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great story be John. Once you start one of his books, you can't stop. It took me only 24 hours
B00C1XZ2LQ|1.0|Another ho-hum sci-fi disaster. Lots of intriguing visuals but in my opinion the musical score sucked. Rampant cacophony. Pure torture for hearing aid wearers like myself. A three toilet break flick.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this is a good game but the hit boxes to move things are a little iffy. This is Good for people who want our like SimCity
B00005JNS0|4.0|A little too adult, and not as entertaining as the original! My three year old grandson sat through the original in one viewing, but constantly lost interest in this one; this movie is not as entertaining for younger children!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful. Wonderful.  Hooked from the beginning.  Couldn't put it down. Great writing.  Fascinating story. You must get this book.  ENJOY.....
B003LR5BD0|5.0|I like this movie alot. I rented this movie for a school project and it was great. Thank you again.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is an interesting funny, and yet serious read. Once again Lee Child has done a great job of mixing in drama, laughs and a story line to make you enjoy the characters and the story.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|I love all these books. They make me laugh out loud. The writing is brilliant and I relate closely to the lead character's flaky way of thinking.
0062127241|4.0|I have recently read autobiographies by or biographies of David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, the members of Led Zeppelin--and this may have been my favorite of the pack. I don't even like the Who or Pete Townshend, but after reading this, I have more insights into why. The story of Townshend's unhappy childhood sets the stage for his future as an unhappy adult. Throughout his life, he has vague memories that he may have been sexually abused. This leads to his inability to be close to others (including not being able to write songs co-operatively with other band members), drifting apart from his wife from the beginning of their marriage and feeling driven as a workaholic to keep himself busy to keep the bad feelings away. One interesting aspect of Townshend's life is that he was comparatively uninvolved in drugs and groupie behavior for much of the Who's rise and fame. Another is that the band for a long time made very little money (again, comparatively) from their work. For example, the 2002 tour during which John Entwistle died was undertaken because Entwistle was broke. But I digress--the focus of this book is Townshend. If you are looking for Who stories, look elsewhere (as he states in the book), because you won't even find out how Entwistle or Moon died in this book (he assumes you know). The attention is inward as Townshend attempts to make sense of the band's growing fame and how it still doesn't make him happy.<br />As someone who knew little about Townshend except that he always came off as a surly, er, jerk despite being rich and famous, I now have better insights into why he's a surly jerk (at times). I had no idea he was involved in so many pies, with a million projects going at any given time, or that he followed some mystic named Baba.<br />One thing I've never liked about the Who's music is it seems to always be rehashing the emotions and frustrations of being a teenage boy over and over again. After reading this book it is clearer why, as Townshend repeatedly returns to the themes of growing up and maturing in every work he creates, while admitting that he himself didn't mature until he was nearly 50.<br />I appreciated Townshend's brutal honesty toward himself and his writing ability, which made me riveted to this book about a person and a band I didn't and still don't particularly like. I also feel a little sorry for him and hope he finds some peace in his life.
B002APU580|5.0|Simply the best. The chemistry between Keira and Matthew was incredible and palpable. Donald Sutherland was at his best too.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I really like Matthew McConaughey he is a good actor and I like most of his movies so when I see he is staring on a movie I know it must be good this is a good show to watch Highly recomend this show
B007DIQC90|5.0|This album is consistently original and very good from start to finish.  I can't wait to hear what they come up with next, and hope they'll tour more widely in the U.S.  :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A soap opera with a history lesson?  This is a very nice surprise for me.  Acting, writing, and scenery is true to the period.  Well done!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|tipical for the writer,surprise funky music, good story line and a little extra violence, great characters. beer and popcorn . a strong stomach and hey after that ..its all fun
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting, top to bottom is very good.  The writing is outstanding.  This series is a very pleasant surprise to me.  I love it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It's a fairly good game.  It grows on you and I couldn't stop until I had finished all of the first Arcade series.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|I sat down to watch this with my wife hoping for a simply entertaining movie.  Needless to say, we looked at each other twice in awe of the horror we were watching before she told me to just turn it off.  No, I am not talking about the violence.  I am talking about the horrible story line, and even worse directing.  It was like this movie was trying to be a kung-fu movie, but was also trying to be modern, hip-hop, action, gory, fast paced, and just plain weird.  I think a 6th grader could have written a better story (from what I saw).  I have liked some of Tarantino's movies, but this one is a stinker.  Move along to something else and don't waste the precious minutes watching this movie unless that is what you are looking for.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|One of my favorite classic 50's si-fi flicks Robby the Robots 1st movie, great cast, music, and &#34; electronic tonalities&#34; aka sound effects...lol One of the earliest uses of a theremin in a movie. Great cast including Walter Pidgeon, as the very serious,Dr. Edward Morbius ,Anne Francis as the very nieve  Altaira 'Alta' Morbius and Leslie Nielsen playing it straight as Commander J. J. Adams.<br />Cool effects no &#34;CGI&#34;  some of the best matte painting to come out of Hollywood d  ery cool scene's when Morbius shows Commander Adams and crew around a part of the huge underground Krell power generating complex. Then the terror begins.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This was one of the first apps I downloaded for my Kindle Fire when I wasn't sure if the device was charging. In fact, it  wasn't- the charger was defective. This app offers peace of mind with a clear indication of battery level. A must-have!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed how Victoria used her love and knowledge of flowers to heal parts of her troubled life. It was fascinating to learn the meaning of so many flowers.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Likes the Musical even the movie was ok  but just couldn't get into the book. Maybe if my French was better I'd like it in its original form.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Knowing the story of his life made this even more enjoyable. Everyone claims that his first COLD FACT is better, but I like this one just a much.
B000E0W24S|5.0|Hair-raising interpretations of all 3 symphonies. This seems to be the way Russians would want to hear Tchaikovsky. Mravinsky even made me a believer in the 5th Symphony - the finale is wonderful. And the closing of the Pathetique is scary for the emotions it evokes that were composed not long before Tchaikovsky's apparent suicide. This album is history.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think it is a great way for kids to be creative and have fun with freinds on co-op . Also my son and daughter play togeter and have fun.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A fun game to pass the time with. I like being able to beat my previous score. Best score so far-2 million plus. After a few games you begin to learn how to get your score higher.<br /><br />i
B000SEGMAU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a sincere loving story full of good life lessons for all of us.  I wish I had read it before I learned the hard way.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I didn't know what I was in for, but i enjoyed the movie very much. It is much better than the &#34;Sly&#34; ones I tried watching afterwards.
1401232590|5.0|Excellent artwork and storytelling; be sure this is in your Batman library to have a more complete understanding of the Nolan-based Dark Knight world
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I could never see myself watching a Star Trek movie. But after watching this one, I can't wait for the new one.
B00000JPH6|5.0|A great find. My local stores did not carry this title and \\"could not get it\\" for me. So thanks a bunch.
B00BU2SIW4|1.0|What happened? Where are the songs? Where is the backing MUSIC?<br /><br />So it goes, they've lost their edge, they're past their prime, why bother anymore? Time to call it a day and stop releasing \\"product\\". This should be shunned like a vile awful smell. Depeche Mode is now on my \\"I will no longer buy anything from you blindly list\\" they are going to have to prove it to me in advance before I buy.<br /><br />Come Thanksgiving no doubt the Sound Opinions guys are going to list this one on their Turkey Shoot special for 2013.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|fits product well and protects it nicely. Easy to use, well built....should last long time. attractive, good price. would definately recomend to others.

B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Perhaps I'm just tired of what seems like the same thing over and over with this movie. All the villains look exactly the same with no hair and no cloths to start with. It's a dozen little guys taking on thousands of monster villains and winning all the time, even though it's luck or some weird unbelievable intervention that does the trick for them.<br />The movie is just really long for no good reason, as they focus on very small themes that take a long time to make happen, and have no real significance in the film; like the dinner that takes forever to make the point of simply bringing them all together. My point is the editing wasn't very good from an entertainment point of view, but very good if this was a documentary.<br /><br />ONLY ONE SINGLE girl in the entire film and she has no real part especially. Once again all men, killing everything they touch and blood everywhere is the central theme. I just get tired of this.<br />I don't mean to preach but, this world goes down and down in so many ways, and giving our society a steady never ending dose of violence, day in and day out doesn't help one bit, and in fact it hurts this society more than anyone thinks. We're the most violent nation in the world, killing millions for \\"peaceful reasons\\" of course. LOL What a joke huh.<br /><br />Couldn't they have made just one tiny part a love story, or something good happening along the way to at least add some balance, rather than non-stop mayhem? It would have been nice, but in this peaceful land of America...I guess it'll never happen, because people love killing here, and love to see it everyday to the exclusion of everything else, until finally they don't even notice it anymore and fail to even see it's consequences......Like the people that read this, that will love this film, and let their children watch it a hundred times as they wonder what happened to this society, failing to see they contribute to it, every single day.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|The story was interesting. The plot kept you invested in the characters.  The narrative was annoying at times because the use of language and inconsistent use of words. It poses some questions about child development (environment versus nurture ). Overall you should proceed with caution.
B000W1TIN2|4.0|I find this music quietly inspiring, easy to write by and leaves me feeling up. This was the music that led me out of my Goth period to more hopeful times. I have enjoyed it immensely and hope to keep listening to this group.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|By far my favorite author!! Truly inspiring words for everyone. I've read it several times now and keep learning from him!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great show with wonderful accuracy.  The characters are well developed and have you cheering for them.  Thanks to the History Channel.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I love ALL things Pratchett!  I thought he was done writing....Thrilled to find out that I was wrong.  As always, a good read.
0765342294|5.0|Great book for young men, but really good for every one.  The Ender Series is a fantastic series for adults especially with substantially thought provoking plots on the meaning of life, societies and their cultures, while being exciting at the same time.  FANTASTIC!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Justin's high pitch voice wasn't what I expected at all. Songs were mediocre. Suite and Tie and Mirrors are good. The rest left a lot to be desired. Maybe next album..
B00881PTRC|5.0|I absolutely love hangman games they're fun to play and the scenes are hilarious. I wonder if there's an unlimited hangman.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Could not put this book down.  The unexpected keeps you turning the pages just waiting for the next surprise.  Love it!
B0083GDLL8|5.0|One of the best albums ever produced,and it is still 15-20years before me!!!!! Gotta love Bowie!!!!!!!! Now for THE THE & THE CLASH!!!!!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Lost is one of the most creative series I have ever watched. The stories are original and keep you guessing. If you enjoy drama with a side of science fiction, this is the series for you.
B00543R3WG|5.0|My dad absolutely loved them although he could have turned the tv down just a little too watch them lol
0307352153|5.0|If you work with introverts, or if you are one, by all means read this book. Excellent insights into the quiet people of the world, their gifts, and their ways of being. Very readable, very accessible.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Simply Amazing!!  The power of love will withstand anything.  This movie will inspire you to do something you thought you were not even able to do.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Season 3 was rather slow and uneventful.<br /><br />I hope the writers have better luck with Season 4.  More action is need and more vital key characters would be a plus.<br />They keep killing off all the good characters that actually contribute to the story line.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very entertaining!! The story kept me going and the puzzles kept me guessing! Hours of game play! Hurry up sequel!
B001DM1VXE|2.0|It just wasn't for me.  It felt disjointed, which I believe was the intention of the director/editor, but I did not enjoy it.
0307463745|5.0|This book will revolutionize the way you think about conducting business in your workplace. I will be buying a copy for each of my employees.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great ending. Really an engrossing story and filled with the damage that can be done to one's soul. Couldn't put it down.
0316098515|5.0|The book is awesome. Inside the book is new but the cover might be little bit torn out. But over all the book is still look new.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like the game but I dnt like how when u start a new level it takes away a life. I'm used to games taking away a life when u fail a level
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The character is technical in his descriptions, (I am too, so I understood and enjoyed it). Yet, he does a great job of explaining it in layman's terms, too. I enjoyed this book very much. Loved the character, the setting, the conflict and challenges, the choices, and the ultimate outcome. One of my favorite books of recent date.<br /><br />Author G. F. Smith
B002S45V32|5.0|Molly and the gang are awesome in this throwback to the 80's!  Highly Recommended for those that grew up during this era, and for those curious younger viewers that wonder why some adults are so passionate about the movies and music of the 80's!
B004SEUIXS|5.0|[[[Magnini - he's the grocer, right?  (lol)]]]<br /><br />Loved this sweet little film.  Very French in all the right ways.<br /><br />Big thanks to Amanda Knox and Raffaele Solecito for letting us all know about this precious treasure we probably would've missed if it hadn't played a role in their (bizarre!) Perugian story.<br /><br />Hope they both see a happy ending one day, just like Amelie, her sweetheart and her very, very wise and loving father.  :)<br /><br />(It doesn't come in Italian, does it?  Only a VERY warped and sadistic mind would imagine that this very tender film could inspire anyone to bad deeds. - Rubbish!)
0307279189|5.0|A motivational read that inspires the self to look deeper, reach deeper, live a richer life; all through the basic mechanics of running the way we were born to run:) If you dont run now or if you have never ran but dreamed of flying on your own god given two legs, this is a MUST read for you! A very well written adventure that kept my attention to the end and beyond.
B0073COMKW|5.0|The light works very well with a solid warm light.  I shall be acquiring more of these bulbs as they work well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's definitely a must read. Get prime and borrow the third one, you will have to to finish the story.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|It's a great album if you like Blues. It's not &#34;Old Schooool&#34; Blues, but it's pretty fantastic. Saw him play with Black Country Communion and got tickets to see him in December. Can't wait!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is rich with emotion and page turning relationships. The characters are well developed and draw the reader in as the story unfolds.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Great album. They are back (with a new tour - how convenient) and it's really good. Listen to it 2-3 times and you'l REALLY love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Another amazing story by Colleen Hoover!  It put me through a whole roller coaster of emotions.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Joe AND Beth? Whaa..? Wow! I would love to see that concert. These two are the perfect match, musically. I wish more musicians would try stuff like this.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google Search always finds me the information I need. I am getting rid of reference books, all I need is Google!
B00338QENI|5.0|Very organized poignant story about a family that was thrust into the middle of medical ethics. The writer did an excellent job of keeping interest and focus on the fall out of one small sample of cells. In the end it's about the story of those left behind when someone dies and how to cope when your genetics are co opted.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Terry Pratchett still continues to amaze us 30 years into his Discworld series of books. His characters are as vibrant as ever and his story lines always do a wonderful job of touching on real life subjects in a way that makes you really think about how you view the world. I wouldn't recommend this as a first read, introduction to Discworld, obviously, but it is a great read for those familiar with this wonderful, quirky world.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So glad this book had a happy ending. I never expected the twist at the end. This was a real page turner as it got closer to the end. I loved this book!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time.  Could not put it down. Would highly recommend
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  It expands the mind and ignites possibilities outside of what we've been taught in schools.  I would definitely recommend this show.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|The sound quality of these headphones is excellent and they're super comfortable. BUT the stitching in the ear pads came undone about 3 or 4 months in and I have to send them off to New Jersey where for a $45 fee they'll fix them. I didn't expect such shoddy craftsmanship from Sony.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|They are very nice headphones but since it was used it was missing some cords. Didn't return the item just bought the cords myself...still cheaper than buying them brand new.
B000SW2F8A|5.0|Filmed in Indonesia, it reflects the beauty seen there and the unique splendor. The acting is superb. The raw talent of Jodie Foster carries through every moment and the charisma and acting of Chow Yun-Fat are outstanding as well. The script is well written and played with many other characters who distinctly add to the story theme and overall quality. While, in reality, Mrs. Leonowens wrote her original memoirs with a bit of exaggeration in terms of her importance to the Siamese Court, this adaptation is pure pleasure to watch. The unspoken romance and human interest elements are realities of that time. Given the predominance of English rule over so much of the world during that period, it is interesting to see how that is dealt with in the movie. The recognition that English feeling their superiority over other cultures and having that recognition seen as well as colonialism for profit addressed added depth to the film. Very enjoyable film. I've watched it several times and I'm glad because I see an added depth or detail with each subsequent viewing. I'm happy to see this genre leave the Yul Brenner stage behind and move in a newer direction. Chow Yun-Fat is an outstanding actor and a good man from all I've read. There truly is something to be said about Buddhism.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Every other day I have to re add my locations. It acts as if it's the first time I've ran the app.  It was okay until the last upgrade.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|For historical  fiction, this is the best and most interesting/gripping books I've read!  Very informative about a different world and time, in a wonderful story...
B000068NOV|5.0|the model is top notch, with everything in the right place, all down to the flux capacitor inside the cabin of the vehicle. The doors open and hood lifts and there is a lever below the car to flip the tires on their side in order to switch to flight mode. It is extremely cool to see the vehicle as a flyer. The only annoying thing is that the car comes mounted on a display base and there is no way to remove this easily. It makes the car look great on a desk, but I like my cars to sit on their tires and the delorean is lifted in the air. However, showing it off as a flying machine is perfect with this base. I am very happy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a great game and I would recommend everyone to at least try it. I play it all the time, but it's a game my daughter downloaded.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|The kids love it. It was recommended from a family member whose kids play it all the time. It nice that there are upgrade options.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Liked this game! The puzzles required thought and the hidden objects were sometimes tricky. The storyline was a little corny but hey,  it's a fantasy after all. Worked flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is a pretty simple concept so it seems great for younger kids as well. My 4 year old loves it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|As a veteran of that &#34;police action,&#34; I was particular interested in the contrast between North and South. Having seen the difference in the south since talking to some of their people, you wonder why not more have defected from their northern neighbor.<br />The dictatorship that is now on its third generation of leaders is a perfect example of how not to run a country The suffering described by those Ms. Demick interviewed, and the numbers who have starved to death because of the insatiable desire for the &#34;Dear Leader&#34; to create a big army instead of joining the world of nations eager to promote progress for their constituents makes us even more appreciative of the freedom we enjoy. It's a wonder why there has not been a rebellion.<br /><br />John Herzfeld
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Just like the first temple run it is a pretty simple concept so it is great for younger kids. My 4 year old loves it.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Totally outstanding series and excellently done.  I found it to be very authentic and the plot keeps you on the edge of  your seat.  Very action packed program, while at the same time giving viewers and excellent insight into these amazing peoples customs, rites, and religion.  Excellent use of a persons viewing time.
B008I3RARW|3.0|My grandson has tried to play on it but I believe it is above his level so I will just keep it until he figures it out
0735619670|5.0|I actually liked the first edition better. But either is fine. If you want to write good software, read this book. It is well organized, clear, and full of good information.
0375831002|5.0|When I was finishing this book, I sobbed for about the last 13 (some were very short) chapters. It was great! The book is heart-wrenching, interestingly told, and beautiful. It tells of what its like to feel out of place, lost in the world, and hurting. It made me cry and laugh and be happy to live like I do. Definitely going down as one of my favorites! I would recommend this to anyone, just like my friends at school did to me! The emotion is deep, but not too deep to where you feel like the author is dragging it out. I felt pain when Liesel did,(but I'm sure anyone reading this would know the plot) and I love how every little thing connected, ending the book with all loose ends together. Throughout the book, the little previews make it nice and interesting to read, and the bittersweet ending took some sadness away, but left me with enough to remember. Overall, GREAT BOOK!!!!!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I loved this movie. At first, I thought maybe the previews gave away everything and there might not be much else to the story, but it goes much more in depth about how each man's life is affected by their relationship.  Well-developed plot, well-acted, and inspiring.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|LOVED IT. It was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I want to read the next one so bad!!!!!!!<br />And the next one and the next one . I want to read more!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Might be more interesting for children.  Did not keep my attention for a long period of time  might be more interesting for others.
0425252868|5.0|If you enjoy stories about WW2 aircraft and battles and any other type of personal history of WW2, this is a must read. The reading is a page by page thrill as you live not only the life of the American airmen but the German pilots as well. From Africa to the sky above Germany and Austria, you will hang on every word. This should be a movie some day as it also reviews the political conflicts within the German Air Force. Buy this book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I find this game very entertaining and fun to play. The rules and directions are easy to follow  and there many versions to play.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is highly enjoyable and very addicting game.  Graphics are great and being a Disney lover, it's awesome!  Get it!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|The plot line was good and it had lots of action but I felt like some of the special effects were a little cheesy looking. Overall a good movie though.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Picked up this bluray 3D movie at BB and i am still in awe on what an amazing job Steven S. did converting this classic film into 3D! I've seen plenty of movies that have actualy been shot in 3D that do not even come close to the quality in which jurassic park is presented. Beautifull and just breath taking! This is a must have for anyone's collection. Its the perfect film to show case your 3D home theatre system. Plenty of incredible \\"pop\\" out scenes with a perfect combination of depth. Crank up your surround sound and you'll see,hear and almost feel T Rex breathing down your neck! lol
B003VVFGWC|5.0|I bought all 3 seasons in HD to watch the series again before the movie comes out. I think it was some of  Kristen Bell's best work.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The best blu ray pack you can buy and seem to have all the content anyone could want for their movie pack.
0061777269|5.0|THis book looks at the idea of consciousness beyond life in scientific terms as well as from many personal experiences. I appreciated the extensive data, the scientific approach which gets into the workings of the brain for the layman to understand as well as quantum physics, and all the statistics. That combined with personal stories gave me an unbiased look at life after death.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|A key reason for the success behind Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy was close adherence to the source material. Jackson and crew seem to have abandoned this philosophy for The Hobbit. The original story has been butchered almost beyond recognition. Radagast the Extreme Sled Rider and Gung-Ho Bilbo were particularly painful to watch.<br /><br />A bitter disappointment.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great rooms fun items play a tablet and wins are too infrequent when I watch the winners names below on each game I play can't understand it
0865479410|4.0|Wonderful book demythologises some self-help and looks at how to achieve more realistic happiness through what Burkeman calls a 'negative' path - one of my must-reads of 2012
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Yemen and Yemeni names got tiresome.  Also, the entire book leads to one mission, and not a satisfying ending as to how<br />they got back.
B000002PCS|5.0|It's the most flowing peaceful music.  The violins are beautiful, the piano is stunning, and the piano in the very last movement melts my soul.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Bon Jovi has evolved but they are still one of the best.  The style has changed as they have matured, and that suits those that have matured and evolved as well jusst fine!
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book, my first for this author.  Terrible writing, ridiculous story, and a total waist of my time.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|It is one of those albums you will have on repeat for a long time. Even when you take it off repeat you will never be able to get enough. From start to finish, I can't find a song I don't love. One Republic has done it again! This album definitely shows that One Republic has a lot of staying power and is going nowhere. My favorite tracks (which are extremely difficult to pick) are If I Lose Myself, Feel Again, What You Wanted, Can't Stop, Au Revoir and Building Bridges.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great, it is a very easy to use app. It is one I use often. I like that the numbers are big too, my fingers don't fumble around.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|The dwarves look completely ridiculous for one thing, the acting through out the film is extremely childish and corny for another. I don't know what happened but somebody definitely lost their passion.<br /><br />Sorry, Mr. Jackson, but not even Lord Smith and Ian McGandalf could save this one.<br /><br />For the record, Return of the King wasn't all that great either and had many of the same downfalls, though thankfully not nearly as many.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved the original Star Trek TV series and the movies.<br />Would recommend to anyone who likes SI-FI.<br />Worth renting.
1616550414|5.0|I purchased this book for one reason and one reason only, the official chronology. I was surprised, but not disappointed. The rest of the book is a beautiful piece of art from cover to cover. Must have for any fans of the Zelda franchise. The book includes an in-depth look at the making of Skyward Sword and the origins of the series as well as original artwork and never before published concept pages dating back to the original legend of Zelda. This is a textbook heavy love letter to the franchise from its creators and it shows on every page. Buy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm really pleased with the game itself. It is a great way to pass the time when I am waiting for appointments. I don't like all of the pop up ads though. Other than that, I would recommend it.
B0085OELXK|2.0|I didn't like this movie at all. IT seemed Matt's character was a wanabe queer. The movie was boring. But Gwenth was a great actress as usual. DOn't bother, this movie is not worth watching
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I really liked the way that they tried to tie in all of the historical events. It gives the movie a great feel. The special effects were good and the story line was awesome. I would never have pictured Abraham Lincoln as a hero type in this respect. I think that they did an amazing job of retelling the history and events of the Civil War. Even my better half, who is known for picking movies apart, loved this one. :)
B00A85EMVK|2.0|I have to give this a thumbs down on the 3D effects in this fim.  I looked forward to seeing the aerial combat in dramatic 3D.  In fact it is almost totally absence from all combat sequences.  Everything that was  originally good and bad about this film remains the same.  However, pass on the 3D version.
1476733953|5.0|I felt like the middle dragged a little bit but only because there was so much to focus on at once. Beyond that this is one of the best sci-fi dystopia books I've ever read, and I just bought the sequel to continue on. I really think Hugh Howey is soon to become a household name, and the way that he originally published this book gives me a lot of hope about the future of literature in the digital world.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I loved season 1 so much that I couldn't wait for season 2 to come out.  I purchased it as soon as it was available.  If you liked the books, you will like this show.  Very good.  Watching season 1 and 2 over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Simply an amazing series of books.  The author's style of writing is very easy to read and the story is very engrossing, making you read just that one extra page to find out what is going to happen next.  The overall premises of the story has been done before, but the way this particular story is told makes it very unique.<br /><br />The author makes you believe in the characters and makes you feel part of the story, I really cared what was happening to each and every one of them.  Enough questions were answered at the end to leave me satisfied whilst also leaving enough issues unresolved for a follow up books.  I certainly hope the author revisits this world and finds more stories to tell.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|This movie never fails to move me in such a way, I really can't describe. The upbringing of Yentl and I was so similar (mine, not so drastic). Daddy, can you hear me?
B00881PTRC|4.0|This game is super cute. I love the animations and the large selection of words (and themes) available.<br /><br />My only complaint is a MAJOR one. This has no lefty setting. Normally, this wouldn't bother me, but if you are going to put all of the action on one side of the screen, I would like to be able to see it without having to stop between every letter.<br /><br />My verdict: Hangman is Hangman. It's fun. This is a great version of it. However if you are looking to pay money for a cute version with animations and happen to be a fellow southpaw, keep looking. You'll be acutely aware of the fact you aren't able to fluidly play.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott card is one of my favorite authors. The ender series is the one series of books that really gave me a way to think about things. Always I say to myself what would ender do.
B003UN409Q|4.0|The movie is in the classic arrogant Oliver Stone style. And I mean that in a good way. He snatched up California kid Val Kilmer at just the right time to take on rocks most enigmatic persona. Although it fudges some of the facts for dramatic purposes and really &#34;goes for it&#34; in regards to the native American aspect, it's surprisingly in line with the band's history. It your looking for insight into Morrison as a person, then look somewhere else. If you interested in Morrison the Pagan rock God, then this is the movie you're looking for.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I will never watch another of Q Ts movies. Story was weak... Senseless blood...trying to be a Pulp Fiction of spaghetti western world. An Oscar nominee? Really?
B0098460O4|5.0|These guys have terrific voices, rivals to Boccelli and Dion! If you like the classical/pop blend, this CD is for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a near addictive version of an old favorite!  Rarely can I play just one game.  I get caught up in the challenge and time just flies by.
B000Z8GZYW|3.0|My husbands favorite movie, so I ordered for his birthday.  DVD will not play on all of our players.  Noticed that it feels thinner than other DVD's.  Will play on one (newest), so decided not to return it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The constant stream of mini-missions for silly things like &#34;rub your head against the ceiling for 1,000 meters&#34; is fun, along with the cool gadgets you get to use and neat vehicles. it's great for boredom.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has always been a favorite mystery writer of mine.  She gets you on page one and doesn't leave go until the very last line.
0307279189|5.0|You don't have to be a runner to enjoy this. You will enjoy it even more if you are one. Great storytelling. Fabulous read!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read Sparks novels when I'm in the mood for a sappy love story and don't expected much else from the plot.  Wow was I surprised by the twist in this book and the complexity of the story.  I highly recommend this as the best Sparks novel yet!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very imaginative. Curiosity keeps you going to the last page.  The characters are well developed and memorable.  Definitely makes you wish you could visit those striped tents for real.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is amazing more detailed and involved  than the show could ever be. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Great flick, McQueen at the top of his game, not that he was anything other than at the top and worth watching just for the chase thru the city.....!
B003ZJ70W4|4.0|The streaming and play ace were great just the movie it's self wasn't all that great! Guess my expectations were higher...
B007D2XSW0|4.0|nice--lots of options for photo editing on the kindle but I had to get the hang of it--lost some pictures in the beginning
B003SI7SRE|3.0|The movie my kids love but streaming was awful. It kept freezing up and stopping and starting all over at the beginning. Other wise it was good. I know not wasn't our connection as we watch several shows and downloads from amazon and various other streaming shows...good movie to laugh at.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great entertaining game for  a length of time!! It takes a while to get the game going but once you do you can't stop

B005IQZB14|5.0|A long, difficult hike, yes, but a real heroine's journey to self discovery and healing. Enjoyable read, and a great lesson in creating a compelling memoir.
B0083EM24C|4.0|I enjoy several songs on this album, but Manners in my opinion is a better album overall. Still some great songs that I thoroughly enjoy.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Great character development, world building- I loved it to the last drop.  A relief to read such a well written book.

B004SBX112|5.0|killer game, great way to pass the time! a bit tougher than the other versions ive seen. gotta love the angry birds lol!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Ok, so I watched M2M and liked it. Call me a Mars fan, but this was fun.<br />Not up to the level of wild imagination of Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars series, but a fun, quick, and believable (and not entirely predictable) read.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|&#34;Hamlet&#34; is as relevant today as it was four hundred years ago when Shakespeare wrote it.  It is probably the finest single item of literature ever written, but it is fiendishly complex and it is long.  Branagh chose to film the entire play uncut.  That means exquisite attention to detail, with all of the wonderful minor roles, just to keep it interesting on-screen for long enough to watch it.<br />  At just one viewing, my opinion is that he succeeded beyond all expectation.  He may even have surprised himself.  The casting is wonderful, with Branagh himself in the title role, and so many others that's it's almost ridiculous to list them all.  Most notably in my memory, are Charlton Heston as the player king and Robin Williams as Osric, both minor roles.<br />  Branagh proved his worth in his earlier Shakespeare films, &#34;Much Ado About Nothing&#34; and &#34;Henry V,&#34; but he surpassed himself with his &#34;Hamlet.&#34;  I treasure the most well-made films, the ones that are astonishing in their sweep and their power.  This &#34;Hamlet&#34; is in that category.  It has got to be one of the finest films ever made.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Great concept and easy to read. We used it to help everyone on staff aim at what they wanted to make happen this year in their lives.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Started out questionable, but it was intriguing. I'd recommend this book to all who enjoy a book written from a different perspective.
B004F69J0M|5.0|Unbelievable album.  Allman's beautiful blues singing only gets better.  Isn't he in sixties?  Name another rocker from the seventies that can do that.  Never stop Gregg!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Have trouble with the game loading I had to remove and 're-download  other than that no problems would like to see additional options for earning extra lives
B00AA0U046|5.0|This is the first Hendrix album I have bought that was not released while he was still alive.  Believe only three were released while he was alive.  The problem I have is the amount of over dubbing on releases such as this one.  Would Hendrix have approved?<br />I was expecting a bit more jazz feel to the album.  I was wrong.  Its good hard rock Hendrix plus some more mellow sounds and less distortion on the new stuff.  I like it.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|fun game, unlocking new planes is fun.  does get very difficult at the end, ending boss battle seems impossible, but still tryng
B007UXT6T6|5.0|My son and I are fans of the Mission Impossible series.<br />This movie was just as good as the others.<br />From beginning to end full of action; just as we like.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This game is way better than the others. It has more features than the other ones (bombs, rockets, portals, flying candy, ninjas stars, etc.) It's a great game that I highly recommend for all ages.
B008602KQI|5.0|or the subject matter.<br />However, the young stars were very believable in their roles, the movie was well made and I watched it in it's entirety.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|First time playing or trying this game and it is addicting! Fun colors and a fast pace keep you wanting to play more and do better on the next level. Great game when you are bored or are waiting someplace and need something to do.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was another terrific book by Nicholas Sparks!  I didn't want to put it down.  What a great way to escape with one of his books!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Although it doesn't quite measure up to \\"The Dark Knight\\"(a film that showed us how with the right director, a comic book can be adapted into more than just a movie, but a work of art) \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is visually stunning, filled with elements of tragedy, love, betrayal, loss and self sacrifice. Despite it's flaws, the film's overall message, acting, and outcome makes it the conclusion to Christopher Nolan's ground-breaking trilogy the one we've waited
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I love this movie! Highly recommend it to all who love fairy tales. There is probably more truth behind them than we would like to admit.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really love this app it tells me where my battery level is at and i also like the other features this app includes.

1400069807|5.0|This eye opening book on how food is manufactured in this country had me hooked - not in the negative ways of the food manufacturers, but in a very positive way to re-examine my diet.  While some of the material is scientifically dense, it is always well written and fascinating.  The part I found most amazing was how some engineers had great guilt over their role in producing these products and others showed nothing but pride, regardless of the outcome (e.g. obese, unhealthy children).  I have recommended this book to everyone I know and bought copies of it to give to family members.  Buy this book.  Read it.  Change your life.
1595141715|5.0|I read this book in about three hours. it is difficult to put down once you start. I cried through most of the book. It is a eye opening read and allows you to understand what it feels like to be bullied. Great book for teenagers to read.
B00BMUYLSE|2.0|I had read so many glowing reviews of this latest Bowie effort, I was completely ready to be blown away.  I wasn't.  Maybe someday one or two of the songs will become palatable, but nothing sounds much better than his misguided 90's crap.  Sorry, real Bowie fans, the only quality album Mr. Jones has put out since \\"Scary Monsters\\" has been \\"Reality.\\"  To compare this with the greatness of the 70s is absurd.  Ain't no Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Things, Warsawas, Moonage Daydreams, 1984s, Cracked Actors, Moss Gardens, Bewlay Brothers or It's No Games here, much less an album full of 'em.  This old Bowie fanatic (hell, as a teen in the late 70s I typed a good hundred of his brilliantly cool lines/couplets and taped them to my wall) ia just a-bummin', bummin', bummin.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|So funny unexpectedly so crass humor but oh so relateable!! Laughter from start to finish, not your typical rom com at all
B003QF8E4A|2.0|Maybe I was expecting it, but the ending was a little clear about 1/3 of the way through.  Story line seemed a little over the top for a genre that has been done many times before.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I recommend the audible version since this is quite long and I don't have a lot of time.  It is a great book to keep on your ipod and listen to while running errands excercising etc. Very engaging.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|As time goes by, I guess hope gets dimmer for this series ever picking up again.  This has to be one of the most original series I've ever enjoyed.  Great writing, great balance of humor, action, character development and drama.
1594204217|5.0|You had me at Omnivore's Michael! Actually at Botany, to tell the truth. What I love about this new book is how beautifully introspective it is- straight from the intro. When I was in culinary school years ago, and I talked with chef instructors that didn't care about wine, or food science, or the health and wellness of EARTH in accordance with food production, I was dumbfounded...ok, even a little tiffed. And then, up to just a couple of years ago, the \\"top chefs\\" in tv land were critical of even the most simple of suggestions by contestants to incorporate sustainable or healthy, or both, foods- and boy they were axed fast! Today, many of those same chefs have turned the page to capitalize on such things- and it is Pollan's work that we have in large part to thank. Those of us engulfed in the real food movement for decades are so grateful for his resounding voice. COOKED will speak to the hearts of those that may not be on the real food ferry, but excited to hop on the \\"eat with and connect with my family train.\\" And it will feel good when their kids connect with them over the food and respect them for doing good for us all. Not everyone finds it romantic when I suggest making their own yogurt as their colons will thank them, lol. I am ever grateful he didn't skip this amazingly important aspect in human health = good bacteria = healthy gut! My children and beloved husband gave this to me for my bday, and it is my favorite present! Happy spring, cooking and gardening all! Thank you again for your dedication to your work and our world, Professor Pollan!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a great story told in a way that left me wanting more. It's a very personal tale that takes you along for a hike on the PCT. Highly recommended.
B005ZBBKHQ|4.0|If you like the early Cure than this is the album collection for you. It is jam packed with Cura obscura. It is basically a collection of all of the songs that you have probably never heard. And devoid of the songs that you have. Great stuff!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I think this is his best yet. A more relaxed Buble, a more confident man. I love every track except the duet with Reece Witherspoon, which to be honest was only bad when she sang,flat and with no feeling. Best $10 I have ever spent. I love it!
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Amazing album and great seller. I think that this band is one of the finest in our time. If you are not familiar they are worth checking out.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I really liked Taken 1. Shows how far a parent will go to save their children. They go further if they have only one child
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My wife liked the book so much that we rented the movie and watched it twice over two evenings. The film does justice to the book. The dialog was difficult to understand at times, due to the English spoken with an Indian accent, but it was quite natural and effective. The story is marvelous and the adventure is gripping at times. Judging by the credits, it took a tremendous amount of work to make this picture. The visual effects are astounding, and the sound track is quite good. The storm at sea was heart-stopping. We listened to it in my home theater, which has a very powerful subwoofer and seat shakers, and the shipwreck scene has some of the most powerful low frequencies that I have experienced. It made me feel like I was on that ship in the storm. I can't imagine how they were able to create the scenes with the animals on the boat, particularly the tiger. Overall, this is a marvelous movie.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|A smart and fun movie, great plot, great acting, loads of fun.<br /><br />Highly recommended and one of my favorites of the year
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game on my laptop so when I found it as an app for my Kindle Fire I downloaded it and have really enjoyed playing it.
B00CFEJGO0|5.0|I have really enjoyed the show. I think it is intelligently written and is extremely engaging. As a fan of all of Thomas Harris' books I think this show does a great job of representing his characters.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has great insight and is very knowledgeable around the subject of living in the now. This book inspired me in many ways and in fact changed my life. I have read it through and have started reading it again. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Between this, stretcher, itune genius, and podcasts why use your car stereo as anything other than a preamp.  Sirius cuts out in heavy rain on the north side of highrises, their customer service sucks, and their customer service practices are questionable at best and criminal at worst.  I've been a long term user of di.fm and now that there is a solid app on every platform I own; web, android, iPad, windows 8, and it works on every audio player I've tried to use.<br /><br />The only problem I have discovered is advertisements being in front of the drop down menus on some browsers but that is manageable and a nuisance at worst.<br /><br />di.fm is synonymous to NPR for me... You can listen for free but because you believe in it so much you donate to it's future.<br /><br />keep up the good work.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Just didn't care for the way the story was going so I never read past the first chapter. Or perhaps I didn't like the way it was written, either way.  Never read much of it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have a satellite connection, and as such have a very limited amount of data I can download per day. On the other hand I have a truly unlimited 4G data connection through T-Mobile. Thus this app is a godsend. When I'm out and about town I've downloaded a ton of mostly tutorial videos to watch when I'm at home.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, read it in one day. Can't wait to read the next one. Such an interesting series.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|The characters are well developed and the setting is very suited.  History is woven through out the tale and adds so much to the overall affect of the series.  I am finding it rather educational how the class system worked a hundred years ago.  Am told this is quite accurate in it's depiction of that era.  The most fascinating aspect to me is how the lower classes not only accept their &#34;place&#34; but have pride in it.  It is yet another example of how malleable the human mind really is - how easily we can be trained into thinking a specific way.  No wonder the world has been in a rather perpetual mess.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This was a really good read. Again with this author, she should chill out with the cursing. I'm glad this book had a good ending that didn't leave you hanging
1400069807|4.0|This is a powerhouse of a book, dense with information, stories, studies, interviews, facts, figures, conversations, and more. That's one of the book's strength. That's also its weakness, because it's so jam-packed with information that by the end, it was a blur.<br /><br />Moss no doubt gathered many times more material from his info-gathering and research than what made it into the book, but I think he could have made the case stronger with additional pruning. As interesting as the book is, it took me a lot longer to read than is typical for a book I enjoy. By the time I'd read 200 pages, I thought I'd read many more. And there were enough redundancies to make me wonder if the book started as a series of independent essays that lacked adequate editing when combined into a book. I'm concerned that the book won't get the attention it deserves because others will get similarly bogged down reading it. And the people whose health would most benefit may not even try.<br /><br />Still, it's an important book. Moss makes a compelling case for how we're being taken in by the processed food industry and it's revealing that many of the executives as these food giants don't eat their own products. Moss describes processed food as being \\"so perfectly engineered to compel overconsumption\\" and he describes \\"the deep dependence the industry has on salt, sugar, and fat.\\" Almost every one of the hundreds of people he interviewed for the book made the point that companies won't be giving salt, sugar or fat up in any real way without a major fight. As he put it, \\"Salt, sugar, and fat are the foundation of processed food, and the overriding question the companies have in determining the formulations of their products is how much they need of each to achieve the maximum allure.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately, I already eat relatively little processed food, but this book has made me determined to eat even less. Not because I'm concerned about the impact on my health - thankfully, I'm healthy - but because I don't want to contribute to the profitability of companies whose primary goal is to make us eat more and more food that's basically crap.but because I don't want to contribute to the profitability of companies whose primary goal is to make us eat more and more food that's basically crap.
B009GJBEF6|4.0|All the stunts and James Bond stuff meet's the franchise's usual high standards. Brosnan is great and the babes are hot. You just have to decide if a media network owner would really start a war just for ratings. Other than that premise being pretty shaky, the movie's very entertaining.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|E.B. Sledge writes in such a way that almost puts you on the frontline of World War II.  His detailed accounts of his experiences seem so truthful, personal and painful, it seems hard not to develop a sense of connectivity with him through his words.  What a book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You even have to ask??  Whatever your beliefs, this amazing book shows us that despite our phenomenal advances in the arts and sciences, human nature remains essentially unchanged.  I am rereading the Book of Job.  So interesting because I have a friend who is decent and kind and her whole life is just imploding (people she loves are dying left and right--including her 18 year old daughter, 50 year old sister, 56 year old best friend.  And her 7 year old Great Dane had a heart attack and died.  yet, her faith remains strong and sustains her.  Amazing.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Bible!
B0083Z614S|5.0|so very well written it has stood the test of time.<br /> easy to narrate, interesting characters, great plot<br />perfect for anyone, but especially little girls.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|I love music and always looking out for new artists/songs that are new and are coming up, and I'm starting to find them on Palladia's Later...with Jools Holland TV show.  I caught Ben live on the show and looked him up and purchased this incredible album.  I am hooked, beautifully sounding acoustic songs, excellent songwriting, this music really moves you.  He is really good at his craft, and his possibilities are endless as he'll only get better and better.  Can't wait to catch him live someday.  My faves are Old Pine, Diamonds, The Wolves, Black Flies, and Only Love.  Great beach music/chill music, makes you feel relaxed.  Support this fine artist and enjoy!
B0002XMKYE|5.0|There is a reason this picture and Scott won the Oscar, both are great. From open to close, well shot, well directed, well acted
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I can't believe that he really tied it all together. Well done and realistic. I will miss the characters though.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Big fan of Jane Austen books and movies, the love story of all times! I like to read the books then watch the movie then compare and contrast between the two.
B0007P0LPC|5.0|We had seen an upgraded copy of this on the movie screen, and were quite enchanted.<br />Had to have a copy for ourselves and found it to be excellent.

B005723JSQ|4.0|very good, charming and funny. Another fast witty read from Sophie K. I would recommend this to a friend, good vacation book.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me while I was training for a 100 km ultra marathon. Needless to say it was all very relevant and easy to read.  I found it very informative at the same time being a great read which was hard to put down at times.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Sex, violence, anguish, love - this story line has it all, and keeps the mystical aspects of most fantasy novels to a minimum.  Book #5 is a great continuation to the first 4
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Anne Hathaway was committed to this role and she looked like a hot bag of hell. Well, ok. But that did not save the movie. I have seen this musical on the stage and have seen other versions of the movie. This is a darker version to me. It was just flat. Russell Crowe's scenes where he is walking on the wall over the damn were visually better than other versions. He was just passionless. Did they not see the musical on Broadway before they did this movie? I have seen actors look like their guts were going to come out their throats singing those songs. Dig deep dang. Come on. Hugh Jackman was the same. Anne singing I Dreamed a Dream is better on youtube with lyrics than in the movie. There is much more feeling in the song when Michelle Lea and Idina Mendez sing it.
6305079811|4.0|Dumbest movies made... But we like these, others are plan 9 from outer space... We like dumb movies and our collection keeps growing, now we are replacing our VHS with DVD.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|There was not a dull moment in the entire movie. This was a quick paced movie that went from one action scene to the next. I had never thought in a historical context that a black man riding a horse would be a big deal. This movie gives a real thought provoking look into this time period. Leonardo put a charming angle on a deplorable character. One of his scenes was a little hard to watch. Christoph Waltz has worked with Tarantino before. He is a great character actor and lends levity to the film. Kerry Washington is just a pretty face in the movie. I can think of a few actresses that may have brought more to the role. I read somewhere that the whipping scene with her was real. I expected a little more from that scene. For some reason, her facial expressions reminded me of Joan Crawford over acting in a 50s movie.
B001QJUX24|5.0|If you are a John Wayne fan don't forget to put this movie in your collection.  Typical macho John Wayne movie.. Loved it !!!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I was down for the whole story. I was loving it. How he got his name and his family owning a circus. Then the shipwreck with the animals. The time out on the sea in the boat. I could not take my eyes off the screen. I won't spoil the ending up it blew my mind! I am glad I didn't read the book and let the ending surprised me. I may go back and read the book now through.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|this is just a great show to begin with and it gets better as it goes.  to be honest i loved seasons 1 - 3 best.  the difference with season 4 is that since i know so much more background about each of the characters i expect more depth from them.... and not all of them are delivering.  its still a great show and has a lot of potential if they delve into different tangents instead of trying to rekindle the same exciting nonsense from previous seasons (very greys anatomy model).  I really like the Eli Stone character and hope to see more of him.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Psycho has been a classic for so many years, it was hard to image the studio did not want to make this film. It is always inspiring when an artist puts everything on the line and it works. Psycho paved the way for the enitre genre of serial killer films. It seems like Anthony Hopkins playing Hitchcock comes full circle from the role that made him the most famous in Silence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins did a great job playing Hitchcock. Helen Mirren has a type cast. She played Hitchcock's wife in that same spunky old lady type cast she always plays. Hmmm, whatever. It fit in the role. But it was not Hitchcock's wife and we do not know anything more about her than before the movie started. We only saw Helen Mirren on the screen. Ok, it is called acting. Not being a personality.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A good read. I was given over to my suspension of disbelief and carried along by this writer's wonderful narrative. The conclusion left me tearful and content.

B008QE9VJI|5.0|The original series had no closure whatsoever. This movie belongs to the DS fans. It gives life back into Barnabas Collins and leads to an ending that brings Barnabas back to his Josette in a delightfully humorous way. To all of you people who are convinced it should have been a serious made movie, my reply is \\"suck it up\\" and go on. Too many vampire stories out there for what YOU are looking for. You must not know anything of Frid, Depp or Dark Shadows fans. This was the only way it could have been done. I was quite surprised at the original casts making the cameo appearance and was touched by the way Johnny Depp said, \\"Welcome to Collinwood, Sir.\\" when Jonanthan Frid entered  Collinwood with Kathryn-Leigh Scott and Laura Parker on their cameo appearance.  Also appearing was David Selby. Jonathan Frid passed away just before the movie came out. Thank you Tim Burton. You fullfilled your fan base request for the daytime soap.
B009GED1IY|4.0|Strong cast and great musical selection. I found ot different from the broadway show, but as entertaining. Would watch again.
0440245915|3.0|It's kind of refreshing to read this novel after almost three decades of PC crap. I found the novel entertaining, with a bit more substance than your typical light, mass market novel, and enough suspense for a legal thriller.<br /><br />I had read a few of Grisham's earlier novels, and this one surprised me in that there is a quality in his voice that is present in this novel, but not in the rest I've read of his, which include \\"The Firm\\", \\"The King of Torts\\", and \\"The Rainmaker\\".<br /><br />This novel is far from perfect. Although the writing flows, I suspect it is more a matter of Grisham's innate abilities as a storyteller than his abilities as a polished writer. It works. Despite the overly long yarn, the unnecessary characters, and the couple of false clues, the main story works.<br /><br />I saw the movie a few years before reading the novel and was very surprised to learn that the character of Jake Brigance was not the clean cut hero the movie portrayed him to be. I loved that he was a bit sexist, a bit too full of himself, and a bit too concerned with his image in the press. In other words, I loved how such a flawed character could pull through when it really mattered.<br /><br />The character of Ellen Roark seemed superfluous. I thought she and Jake had great chemistry and their banter made for some of the most entertaining passages of dialogue in the book, but I got the sense that Roark (Row Ark) just did not belong in this story. I felt, while still immersed in the novel, that her and Jake's story deserved a novel of its own. Their episode, though scintillating and full of possibilities, was just a distraction from the main story.<br /><br />Another character that seemed out of place was the big shot lawyer from Memphis, Bo Marsharfsky. He felt like a character planted in the story with the sole purpose of putting Carl Lee in the position of having to defend his choice of lawyer before the NAACP people later on. He disappeared as swiftly as he came onboard.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very entertaining, compulsively readable legal thriller with a humorous undertone that is lacking in Grisham's subsequent novels (at least the ones I managed to read before I decided he was much too boring and plain). I'm inclined to think that he \\"cleaned up\\" his writing (made it PC, uncontroversial, etc.) just to reach a wider audience.<br /><br />I wish he would again write as fearlessly as he did on this one.
