B001DM1VXE|4.0|Anyone interested in the union between madness and genius should watch this film.  What is that word for that thought, that word on the tip of your tongue.  What is that thought you have that got interrupted.  You had it and then, where did it go?  A fantastic film of a brilliant number theorist (a type of mathematician) who is driven to madness by following Icarus instead of Archimedes.  Watched it first with my first husband, a mathematician, and still appreciate it today.  What a flight, into the burning center of the sun.  Four stars only because I root for Icarus.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The 3D graphics on this game is amazing. It is well planned and well thought out. As another review said, don't rely on the hints to get you through the game. It's much more enjoyable experience to solve it on your own. I hope Fireproof will come out with a similar game soon. And with more levels.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I did not think I would get as involved in a book on Zombies as I did with this one.  Written along the lines on a historical novel-that is, an instruction manual about a hypothetical subject that is based in part on facts, making it it so much more believable and engaging.  I really enjoyed the read.
B0093ST02E|3.0|As always Michelle's acting was flawless. But, throughout the entire film, I couldn't help but wonder what did she do with her days?  Yes, she's married. Her husband is the 'breadwinner'. But, other than a few classes shown that Michelle's character took, exactly WHAT did she contribute to their relationship?  I found this issue maddening. She had a choice to make regarding her relationship with her husband & her new 'friend'. Although her husband obviously loves her, she definitely was lacking in emotional attachment.  Which is why her character wanders..........NO spoiler alert here!  But, why did she find one relationship superior to the other?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good book.  Liked the way it ended, still hope for the future. I would recommend the whole series of the HUNGER Games.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I'll be brief because so many other reviewers went into great detail. As an actor, I like Liam Neeson. Though I prefer his movies before Taken 1&2 as I just don't buy him in the more predictable action thriller.  If you are looking for adrenaline rushes and blood spilling, you will be disappointed in The Grey. OTOH, if you bring your brain along for the ride and can put yourself in Liam's character's shoes from the moment you push play, this movie is refreshingly different and original.  He is already hollow from loss and numbed out before choosing to work in a place that is freezing cold, desolate, dark and dreary. His job is to protect not-so-lovable people. A horrible accident throws them into survival mode. But they are not alone. And it is a long way to civilization. If it came to that, how would people really react? How long until a man just gives up?  In the end, when you face death, what matters? What would you discover about yourself if you went through such a harrowing experience?  Would it change how you view life?
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie illustrates more effectively than anything I have ever seen of the brutality of the Slave South. Think its overblown just hear the story of the Maryland plantation where they dug up 20 mangled slave bodies buried under the chimney. Multiply the sadism of today by a hundred fold. All the elites back then knew exactly what was happening and covered it up, Twain, Jefferson, Washington, even Lincoln to a certain extent. This is entertainment, but the only way you can sneak the truth through the veil of hypocrisy, bravo Quentin, bravo!
B0025KVLT2|3.0|Received product in a timely manner.  We love the album, unfortunately the original sound leaves something to be desired.  Must note that there were no claims to any upgraded recording.  Still enjoy purchase.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|A hidden object game, adventure game, and strategy game all rolled into one! Travel the world while wheeling and dealing with fascinating paintings.  Look for fakes and hidden objects at every turn.  There are so many ways to buy and sell art that it keeps it interesting and fun.  A very nice change from the creep fest hidden object games that are so prevalent now.  Thanks to G5 for coming up with a new format.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The somewhat plausible plot pulled me in enough to muddle through some of the techno stuff... After all that work, I am glad it ended ok.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Sure, it had problems, a bit of a throw in everything for everyone feel, but it was good enough to be the usual seven seasons.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Some reviewers made comparisons to HEAT.  While I agree there are some plot lines that are similar, The Town definitely holds up on its own. I won't give away any story details.  If you like crime dramas, see this one.  Good action. But the characters make the movie. They are real. They have depth. You could sink your teeth into them. The acting was well done. Kudos to Ben for making sure it was not too polished or too pretty.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Energized  trip Into the dark life of an assassin. Agent Robie is a conflicted character - an assassin with a conscience; giving his best  in service to America. When an assigned hit goes bad, it becomes deadly clear he is now the hunted. Mr Baldacci gives the reader few clues to dissolve  the mysteries until he's ready - Keeps you glued to the story. Fast paced interface of storytelling and some 21century realities . . A thriller that thrills.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I had just read Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL and SHARP OBJECTS when I picked up DARK PLACES.  She can really tell a story, and she has a phenomenal way with words.  I was mesmerized by her ability to create characters so deep and dark, and that's why I read her three books in a row within a very short period of time.  She has an uncanny ability to draw word pictures that leave very little to the imagination.  When she described Libby's bungalow, I could see it, feel it,  and smell it...and it extended my understanding of Libby herself.  Diondre' s sad home in Kearney, likewise;  I especially remember Diondre asking Libby to remove her shoes to walk onto her greasy living room carpet amongst the dog droppings.  I feel like I've been there.  I am an avid and voracious reader, and I'm an eclectic reader...but in all my 60-year reading history I don't remember ever reading a novel with a story line so utterly depressing and ugly.  In all its ugliness, I still couldn't put the book down.  The raw emotions affected me.  Patty left me feeling depressed and overwhelmed.  Runner exasperated and angered me.  I wanted to take Ben by the shoulders and shake him hard to wake him up.  I wanted to slap Diondre.  There are so many brands of misery woven into this story that I actually felt a degree of relief when I finished the last page.  But nothing could pull me away from this book until I read the last word.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I hate having to connect to facebook. the hearts are kinda dumb too. overall its a pretty good game though.

0385349947|5.0|I don't even work anymore and I still got my money's worth out of this book. I purchased it for the benefit of my college-age daughter and now, it's no. 1 on Mother's Required Summer Reading List for her AND her friends with potential. Some of the advice I either have our would have given myself, but Sheryl explains things very nicely and she is much more qualified than me to give advice and examples for the rest of it. She has caused me, a middle-age woman disabled by a chronic health condition, to still ask myself, \\"what would I do if I weren't afraid?\\" and I see that despite the loss of my career, I still have items on that list. Things I could still accomplish if not for this nagging feeling that my final work product wouldn't be \\"good enough.\\"  Screw that.  Thanks Sheryl. Anybody that has a problem with her book is suspect to me, because I can't figure out what there is to criticize. This woman and her book are awesome.  she's a wonderful role model for my daughter and everyone else's too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game has absolutely no problems whatsoever; There are so many cool things in the game; it keeps children satisfied for hours on end. Perfect game!
0385349947|5.0|I've heard a lot of the controversy about this book, with all kinds of people criticizing Sandberg -- many who haven't even bothered to read the book. So when this came up on Vine, I decided I wanted to see for myself. And I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />Not everything will apply to everyone in this book. It isn't meant to. Sandberg openly admits that her privilege has helped her because she can afford to hire the best care for her kids. But just because her background doesn't match my own, it does NOT mean that her thoughts and advice are irrelevant. She still has many very good things to say.<br /><br />I found myself nodding my head vigorously when she talked about how many women worry that they don't have the skills to take on a new role. She states, \\"Women need to shift from thinking 'I'm not ready to do that' to thinking 'I want to do that--and I'll learn by doing it.'\\" I have found myself doing that many times. She also talked about women who worry that they're a fraud and that someone is going to find out that they're incompetent and fire them. Yup, been there, too. Or underestimating my performance on a test, a call, a project. Many women tend to underestimate how well they did on something.<br /><br />Sandberg is a HUGE proponent of choice. Whether you choose to work in an office, work from home, or stay home with the kids really is your choice. And she supports that. But she also encourages us not to step away from responsibility or new jobs just because we *might* have kids in the future. Don't leave before you leave.<br /><br />The book may not be for everyone, but I certainly don't believe that Sandberg deserves all of the criticism she has gotten for the book. Gender discussions NEED to take place and I applaud her for bringing it up and talking openly about it. Especially in light of how it has opened her up for attacks on her motives and relevancy. I will be reading it again and taking notes next time. We can all learn something from this book. I really believe that.really believe that.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best written scripts on television around! I have added this to my growing list of series that I currently watch and wait for the next season.
0553386794|1.0|I was enjoying this book until the chapter &#34;Daenerys&#34;. To be honest, the description of sexual abuse involving a young woman profoundly repulsed me; it's almost pedophilic. What kind of person writes so casually and nonchalantly about a 13 year old's &#34;budding breasts&#34; and being sexual abuse by her older brother? Would readers have reacted as serenely if Daenerys were a 13 year old boy whose penis was being fondled? Why does Martin treat the sexual abuse of a young woman like it's just another social rite of passage?<br /><br />As someone who has friends that have gone through the horrific ordeal of child sexual abused this chapter absolutely disgusted me. That this book could be made into a film speaks volumes about how much we as a society care about the untold numbers of women (and men!) who have been sodomized by trusted family members and others close to them. I am so disappointed in George R. R. Martin and could not continue reading this book or support a writer who describes child abuse in such a cavalier manner.
B0077POH8M|5.0|I built a GA-880GM-USB3 with a FX-4170 and 16gb of Brucial Ballistix Sport BLS2K8G3D1609ES2LX0 and a XFX HD-667X-ZHF3 video card in a low profile case. This cooler did not clear the low profile RAM in slots 1 and 2. All fit and worked fine (after flashing the BIOS while using an AM3 processor) with RAM in slots 3 and 4. Seems nice and cool and really quiet even though I have not pushed the system enough to warm it up. Video card fan makes WAY more noise. If the fan ever goes out the whole thing will need to be replaced, not just the fan. But it is low profile and really quiet.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As to the product itself, what can I say? Knew in advance this was a 1st class video production and of course it is. Transaction was flawless. Prompt delivery and product arrived in perfect condition.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|An amazingly descriptive book that you cannot put down once you start! The book is about Sherlock Holmes who follows a trail of a murder mystery with his companion, Dr. Watson, to reveal the unknown criminal responsible for the murder. The plot builds up and the reader would be astounded by the quick wit and intelligence of Sherlock Holmes. The book is wonderfully written and every line is crafted and put together very thoughtfully.<br /><br />An 11 year old reader.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried a number of android keyboards, from the fairly standard to the extremely unusual. This one is by far the best for me. The prediction is very spot on and always getting better with customization. Add in flow typing, and SwiftKey is a clear choice. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is truly fabulous. I simply can't wait til the next season. I will probably watch individual episodes over the summer  while I wait patiently for Season 4.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this teaches people what horse are like to have and I love this game also because I treat my horse like its real
B004JN1CW4|1.0|While I consider James Dashner a phenomenal storyteller, this book did not live up to the prior books in the series. I was extremely disappointed that most of the main characters from the first book were neglected. Also, I don't understand why Dashner spent so much time developing relationships just to throw them out the window in the last book. This book detailed violence more than the prior two so it didn't quite seem to fit with the other books. But, of you've already come this far, you might as well finish the series. Just be prepared for disappointment.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|A great historical romance. Really like this author. Not too steamy but full of emotion and drama. If you are looking for an interesting HR this one is definitely different and fun.

B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|OK, watched the first Lord of the Rings without knowing the background and was left hanging for 3+ years for the end and fell into the same trap with this one. It was a little slow moving, but entertaining. So now I need to wait until the part 2 (and 3??) comes out for the resolution!
B006WQLH7G|1.0|This is a terrible app. I installed it a week ago and soon it was saying there were problems with everything on my kindle, which I know is not the case. Couldn't figure out how to fix it so it would work, so I finally uninstalled it tonight. I have Avast on my computer and it works great, but not on the kindle fire.
0446585041|5.0|Im a huge fan of Ellen, from way back when she had her own sitcom. She is a joy to watch daily and i always enjoy her books!<br />It was a plus to buy this from a company that assists libraries. I know my money was well spent and i laughed as a bonus!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Hats off to Christina McKenna who has captured the truth of the horrible Catholic orphanages in Ireland (child prisons) while lighting the way for one small boy to be adopted. His struggle to live with his past and his empty present and moments of pure laughter are wound together with skill and grace. The author used local dialect and language to show social differences between characters.  This made the book so entertaining and yet provided a reality that drew you into a time and place that was disturbing and at other times grateful for good people
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's a good game. I recommend it. Hopefully it's fun when I keep playing it and they don't make me pay for every new weapon.

076531178X|5.0|There isn't a fantasy series as FUN as the Mistborn series. Start it and MAKE SURE you finish it and you won't regret it.<br /><br />It's a good book throughout, has a few slow parts, though a little more than halfway through, things pick up like you wouldn't believe.<br />The action scenes are the best I have ever read, reminding me of something out of the Matrix, Dragon Ball Z<br />or the coolest X-Men/Spiderman comics. The magic system takes some getting used to, but after a couple of training sessions<br />that help you understand how it works, you, like one of the main Characters, Vin, begin to grasp it and it gets really cool with how unique<br />it can be.<br /><br />It isn't a PERFECT book, but it just ends so exciting that I can't help but give it 5 stars.<br />There are faults here and there, a few cheesy lines that the author put in that had me scratching my head,<br />wondering how some lines so forced could get into the final draft, and a love story that is kind of a bit<br />awkward at first (though later, makes sense and feels natural).<br /><br />So with unbelievable action, a sweet magic system, epic fight scenes & climax, and stunning twists and turns<br />this is an incredible series to read.

B00C9G22R2|5.0|Splitting quan into soft and hard, the dialectics reflect each other, but in the end they destroy each other in a fatalistic and karmic cycle. Circular in structure mirroring the movements of bagua and its 64 palms, the movie breaks and temporal cohesion seem to skip and jitter. Perhaps also mirroring the broken and non-linear movement of the mind, the movie's internal structure and story-line can easily confuse a literal and linear-minded audience, as easily as a circular-palm disorients a clumsy opponent.<br /><br />Supposedly in the end, the 2 different styles of Bagua and Xing-yi are fused and unified into the modern representation of Wing chun through Ip Man, but the true Grandmaster, Gong Er dies before she can pass her art to another heir.<br /><br />Hidden and mysterious masters are linked through a tangential path weaving the cobwebs of the mind with the dark alleys of Hong Kong, as the movie moves serpentinely through history. It is a highly complex and artful movie made by one of the greatest living directors today. Spending over 13 years of research and a decade to make, this movie is truly a masterpiece, that can only be appreciated by a discerning viewer.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really liked the movie... and I would have liked it more had I not read the books. But for entertainment purposes... it is good.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|I can hardly wait for the next book in the series ! Great  stories ! I have read the three books during easter.

0689835604|4.0|My husband babysits for our granddaughter a couple of hours a day and she is always busy.  This book catches the interest of a 9-month old and gives her something do do while they read!
0399160450|5.0|After buying the kindle edition, I left it due to work and did not read it for quite a while.  I found this book to be even better than the last book, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Hopefully there will be another one out soon, as I will be in line to order it. Yes, there are minor mistakes, but then again: who is perfect?  Last I knew there were only two of who are perfect, and as of late I been wondering about the other guy, as he is floundering.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I waited anxiously for my DVD as it is one of my favourite musicals. It arrived before the due date, much to my great pleasure. It took five minutes to unwrap the wonderful packaging and to put the DVD into the machine. I had seen the play three times and was familiar with the songs and the music score, and sat on the edge of my seat singing along with the movie. It is a classic, one of the best ever produced. It was family viewing; no use of bad language, open sex or violence. It's hard to find movies these days that maintain the good values in life. I would like to give this a rating of ten stars.
1574216988|5.0|Fun book for people to learn how to Zentangle, relax, and to have something to do in a waiting room, car, buss, train, airplane.  This teaches you to play in a small area with just a pen, pencil, tablet, and your own imagination.

B004NS710C|1.0|I like most of Denzel Washington's work but this movie was almost Unwatchable, which would've been a better title for this dud.<br />Ridiculous story (I know, very loosely based on a real event), terrible dialog, uninterested actors and on and on. Denzel definitely phoned this one in.<br />The clincher for me was the gratuitous use of helicopters in virtually every scene. It eventually became comic relief.<br />They were buzzing around like annoying houseflies and for some reason had to fly within feet of the train.<br />Of course they made sure to include the noise of the helicopters which practically drowned out the dialog (maybe not such a bad thing).<br />Save your time and money and skip this one.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Except for this one and it is my favorite show. I love all the actors and if you watch a single episode you will be hooked.
0380715430|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my wife who is a retired English teacher and she liked it very much. We're familiar with Bill Bryson's work and he delivered another good read. Fact mixed with a humorous take makes for enjoyable reading.

B00371XIJE|5.0|This was a great family movie. Clean with no objectionable content - a rarity these days. Demonstrated a touching connnection between man and dog.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. Based on the moving and dramatic novel by John Boyne (most recommended you'll read the book first, equally excellent, before you get to the movie), this is the extraordinary tale of a small German eight-year old kid named Bruno, a kid full of curiosity and motivation that happens to live during one of the most horrible periods of time - that of the Second War World. One fateful day, Bruno moves to live with his family to a far away place, at least far away from his beloved Berlin, where he's leaving behind him his close friends and his former lifestyle. Now, desolated from any urban place known to Bruno, his new house is located near what he's mistaken to assume is a farm, a farm filled with strange inhabitants, all dressed in some kind of striped black and white pajamas, and all with a gloomy and rather sad look in their eyes. Bored with his new house which seem to be isolated from the real world, and having no new friends that he can visit nearby, Bruno decides to explore the vast 'farm' territory he can see in the distance from his bedroom window. One day, during one of his wanderings near the huge peculiar fence that separates his world from 'the other world' he sees a small boy, his age, sitting on the ground on the other side of the fence. This boy, Bruno guesses, is one of those 'farmers' dressed in the striped pajamas. From this point on in the story the two kids develop a most unusual and deep friendship, whose tragic consequences will be revealed just towards the end of the story.<br />The things here are more complicated than what they seem, considering the fact Bruno's father is no less than the threatening commander of the 'farm' - which is actually a death camp, one of those who sealed the miserable fate of the Jews victims during that horrible war... Bruno represents the childhood innocence still not destroyed, while his father - which Bruno adores, by the way - represents cruelty and terror, although of-course between the four walls of his home he's a most loyal, kind and loving husband and father to his two children, a girl and a boy. While Bruno's sister, Gretel, becomes a fan of the Nazis ideas, Bruno is not aware of the horrifying events that occur outside his world - and so, he brings some hope, ray of sunshine and laughter to the short life of poor Shmuel, who's one and only 'sin' is being born a Jew. For almost a year Bruno keeps on meeting with his new friend, until one day they both disappear... Leaving us only to imagine what were their last thoughts during their last minutes among the living.<br />This is one film that seems too tragic to be true, but as they say, the truth is sometimes crueler than imagination, and it's terrible to think this story could really happen in reality... What I liked especially here is the fact you get to hear the story of the Jewish biggest tragedy of all times from the perspective of an Ari boy, and that serves as a reminder to us that not all the people related to Nazis where vicious or  cruel; Sometimes they just happen to be relatives of the monsters called Nazis by chance, not really on their own will. As a proof to that, I found the scenes in which Bruno's mother fights with her husband about his controversial decision of moving to live near a death camp, really reliable and emotional, as I'm sure a lot of wives of these devils didn't reconcile with the fact their husbands are heartless murderers who are able of doing all the horrors in the world once they get an order. In my opinion, this movie gives you the lesson of what might happen when the two worlds - of healthy childhood and the other, of pure insanity and blood-spilling - are colliding. Indeed, more tragic results than what's happening here you won't get to find anywhere else.<br />I was more than impressed with the crew of wonderful actors, each one devoted to his/her role in the most convincing way. You'll be amazed at how people who livedamong us not even one-hundred years ago yet, could lack humanity and compassion, like the Nazis were. A tearjerker all the way and extremely moving, this is a film not to be missed, always to remember and not forget. Grab a hold of it as fast as you can, and share the unbelievable love and harmony between two little boys, not so surprisingly very much alike despite the huge gap supposed to exist between them. Which goes to show the spirit can win all situations.
B000FC11A6|3.0|From the viewpoint of a cryptologist this book rates at least four stars.  I chose not to rate it that way since cryptologists constitute a small portion of the book's audience.  Also, the path through the book's content is frought with jerks in speed & sharp changes in direction, albeit within one overall agenda.  For those of us in the domain of mathematics & cryptology, the examples provided are good the explanations clear & concise.  Cryptonomicon is well wortel the space on one's library subshelf for cryptanalysis.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Its just like MTG so if you enjoy playing that you will like this. I did just start playing this and Magic the Gathering and I'm enjoying both. So far. I just wish this was maybe a few bucks to buy and you get a really good deck to start and then have option to buy better cards later while earning/winning others then this would be a five star game in my eyes. Also I have had a few glitches where it closed game out once and yes you have to click spells a few times to get them to work. But still not a bad game I say it is worth the download.
B004SDEP38|4.0|Great program but needs a print function. Everything else is very cool. I would recommend this program. Get it today! ;)

B003LSTK8G|5.0|If you want to know the truth about the financial collapse, there won't be a better book to read. Some may get more deeply into the complicated minutiae but not without obfuscating the truth. This is a story of the crooks that robbed America blind and the few that understood and bet against them.<br /><br />The only ones totally and inexorably screwed were the middle-class and poor Americans.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie gives you a good foundation on how the Political Left uses food as a weapon. The woman who wrote the book must have either experienced The Old Soviet Union or paid attention watching it when she lived somewhere else.  The storyline is well laid out and the acting is pretty good.  I can't wait for the other two to break out.
0967984602|5.0|well written, easy to understand, especially for a novice as soon as our weather in northern michigan breaks I plan to start building my oven  am a retired chef and am looking forward to enjoying real bread,
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The Seiko 5 is a great automatic watch.  I've been looking for a mechanical watch that looked good and operated dependably for months. For less than $100 the watch feels solid with a sturdy case and an attractive &#34;World War II&#34; style face.  My watch runs about seven seconds a day fast, not too bad for watch at this price.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game but could get expensive......must be patient!!!  Let energy restore in it's own and try to stay away from buying diamonds, weapons etc.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|This is a transforming book. Watch the Gerson Miracle and get educated! You are your primary care provider - take responsibility!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book piqued my interest in the hereafter. I would recommend it to anybody especially the skeptic ones. Maybe this will be a way of opening the door to your higher self.
B00821OX98|2.0|The acting was subpar, but even worse the script/storyline just can't draw you in to make you want to see what is going to happen next.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I'm a beginner and this is a great free game of chess. I've enjoyed playing it and learning basic chess moves.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Fun, feel good comedy. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman were made for these roles. Definite chick flick, but men will like the idea of having a &#34;sex friend&#34;
B0013ND36G|3.0|Not that much more quality from the regular version. And I have a 3D television....  Not impressed with any quality change
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I bought The Hobbitt because it looked like a good and entertaining family movie. The price was good and shipment was fast. I have now watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Perfect amount of drama, love, and laughter! I am absolutely in love with this show!!! Cant wait to see more episodes/seasons!
B004RE29PO|5.0|Just when you thought this movie couldn't get better with age then came along technology.  Blu-ray makes this move even better if that is possible!
B004S5FVJS|4.0|I like this series because I can follow the reasoning. The  characters are all interesting and you relate to them very easily.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I've seen this movie twice before and enjoyed it just as much the third time. Music does unite us all.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|If memory serves the story doesn't end at the point they ended it??  I seem to remember  Bilbo facing off with Smaug
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I don't know much about wild animals... but Yann Martel convinced me he knew a remarkable level of detail. The pleasure of reading 'Life of Pi' is that you are served up a digestible flow of intriguing facts. The rollicking yarn gives pleasure at one level... the insight into animal behaviour is another level... and the ending provides yet another level of understanding... this time into the human mechanism for handling tragedy. The characters (including the animals) are developed with multifaceted personalities... and I grew to like the ones Yann intended me to like.<br /><br />Fit this book into your reading list. It will be a classic of our time.
B0002DB52M|5.0|it is a very good movie i recommend to ppl who like to think.... Nicole Kidman did a good job..
B000ICLRIE|3.0|Orlando Bloom is a subpar actor and with Legolas defending all of Christendom it was hard to buy.  The sword fights were good and special effects were good, but to bad they couldn't have found someone else to be the main character.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Lee Child's development of Jack Reacher continues to build. He in quite an enigmatic figure but with a very strong sense of justice which always seems to go beyond the law.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game and am so glad I can get it on my kindle now and I love the community of people who play the game
B000M4RGA6|5.0|I am excited to receive this movie because it is my favorite Will Ferrell movie and it is great to watch.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Loved the movie. However the Blu-Ray disc I received stopped playing 7 seconds into it. The DVD and the digital copy work fine.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Not a totally accurate depiction of the OK Corral, but very well done with outstanding performances all around. I am a &#34;western&#34; movie enthusiast and this is near the top of the list along with &#34;Open Range&#34; which is still not available in Blu-ray. This is another upgrade to Blu-ray for me and actually paid more than I usually do to get this one along with &#34;Silverado&#34;. Both are classic westerns with excellent cast performances and good action.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was drawn into this in season 1, and am now held prisoner by season 2. Now trying to find season 3 that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
1595141715|5.0|First off lets just say I didn't want to read this book at all. But once my friend started to say how awesome it was I had to try it out. So I looked in my school library to see if they had it. My librarian said no so I was a little disappointed. then I learned my friend that told me about it had the book. She let me borrow it. So I got it in homeroom and I refused to even read the back. by fifth period it had taunted me enough I started to read it. We had a test and my teacher told me to put it down so I almost started to cry because the book was so flipping good. by the end of sixth period I was half way done and didn't cry for Hannah or anybody in there once.<br /><br />So I got home and finished TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY within about say half an hour. remember I already read half the book in school.<br /><br />Anyuhways (wish I could say that out loud to you but I can't)when I finished the book I screamed. Yes literally. This story really opened my eyes to see what other might be going through at my school or even in this world. Its scary to think people want to kill themselves just because a boy or girl did something really stupid not thinking how it might affect that person. So if you are someone who likes a good sad romance or even a heart breaking tale read this book. TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY will change your life forever. it will want you to scream or cry for more. it will open your eyes to this world. Everyone should read this no matter who you are. You might cry for a while or you might be like me who cries in the inside but not on the outside to show how tough you are either way your life will change along with Hannah's, Clay's, Marcus's, Tony's, Tyler's, Jessica's, Justin's, Alex's, Zach's, Courtney's, Bryce's, Jenny's, Ryan's,and Mr. Porter's.<br /><br />Jay Asher is an awesome author. I've read both of his books TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY and THE FUTURE OF US. You should read them too. Good luck and READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|what i like about this series is that although the formula stays the same harry bosch is such an honorable guy you just want to follow his lead throughout the story. other writers like j.d. robb have tried using the same formula for books in the same series but the series got stale. that is not the case here. whether it is your first, or if you're a seasoned regular you won't be disappointed.
B002N1AERI|5.0|In wonderful shape and the disc shines with beauty and just plays like new the music is one of a kind.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Definitely one of my favourite books that I have read this year. wish there were more to come - Will age 12.
1400160510|5.0|Frackin amazing!<br /><br />The ruler of thieves and the Duke of Camorr have a silent agreement: Steal from the merchants (middle-class) of Camorr and the Yellow Jackets will turn a blind-eye, but if you steal from the peers, you will be persecuted.<br /><br />Locke Lamora is a boy who was orphaned at a young age. However, blessed with wit, a sharp mind, and a fast tongue, he quickly finds himself adopted into a family (of sorts) headed by a master of con and deceit. They form the Gentleman Bastard, a motley crew of mostly boys, each with his or her own strength and talent. On the surface the crew is your average band of thieves, but they have a secret that if let out, can dismantle the secret peace and bring about their downfall and maybe even their death.<br /><br />The story is told with interludes that contain flashbacks to the time of the Gentleman Bastard's conception. Each brief tale gives the reader an insight into the events that have shaped each character, with the focus being on Locke and Jean. The overarching plot itself is complex with characters so intertwined. However, Lynch does such an amazing job with the pace of this tale that when all is said and done, you are left with a richly woven story with excellent characters played against a vivid backdrop of Camorr, all of its people and the politics involved.<br /><br />I loved this story from cover to cover. The characters Lynch created are well formed with strengths or flaws easy to relate to or easy to believe. The friendship and loyalty portrayed in this book is something to envy and the cheeky dialogue had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />This is a must read even for those who do not normally read fantasy books as this tale has so many great elements to it that you won't be disappointed moving out of your genre.<br /><br />Narrator: Michael Page<br />Performance: 5/5<br />Fantasy books are hard to narrate because you have a slew of characters and dialogue that need distinction and consistency. Pagedoes an excellent job with this. His timing was right on with the jokes and he was able to bring the characters to life with the way he read each voice. Most male narrators have a difficult time narrating a female character. A lot end up sounding juvenile or mocking so the female characters end up sounding breathy (which is annoying) or idiotic (doubly annoying), but Page softens and lightens his voice just right to bring forth strength and intelligence to the female characters Lynch writes.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Just like regular Facebook. Only wish I could play my flash games on my Kindle Fire HD. Guess I need to use my Kindle more, because I'm not very good at it now.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I read the book because My husband's grandmother was from Guernsey.  The history during the second world war was well protrayed in the novel.  The reader realizes how devistating war is to all concerned.  Even with the enemy there are good and bad individuals.  The character development was extremely well done.  I would recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderfully creative. Highly recommended.  Love the SciFi/Love story mix.  Keeps you on your toes.  Every time you think you have it all figured out, some new, delightful twist is added.  You won't want to put it down.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|I like the service and the CD is in great shape I am very pleased with the item and like it alot.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I really love the game just hate all the ads that keep interupting!  I also don't like that I have to be online to play the game.  Wish it could be contained on the tablet.
0345803485|1.0|I wanted to see what the talk was all about though I was warned in advance that the writing was awful.  I took it on vacation.  I jumped ship on page 6.  I was embarassed at how awful the wrting was.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this book! The perspective coming from a dog was awesome!! I couldn't put it down. I read it in two days!
B00884GR0W|4.0|Love the game but I don't know if it is just my tablet or if every device does this but every once in a while, the controls will get extremely touchy
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I got this for my 4 year old niece and she loves it.  Quick shipment and product as described.  Great price.

1400069807|5.0|To sum it all up .. if it comes from a can, a box, a package, a bottle ... 95% of it .. GET IT OUT OF YOUR LIFE.  If it comes from a fast food place ... say good bye to it.  There are exceptions -- Ezekiel breads, Peanut Butter made with just ground peanuts and a bit of salt like All Natural Laura Scudders, real 5-Minute full cook Oatmeal, for example -- so READ THE LABELS.  It's an art & science to learn to do that.  When you cook (not IF but WHEN, like 3X/day) -- if it just came out of the ground, kosher or from Whole Foods for the most part, or you bought it from the fresh produce section .. that's a good start.<br /><br />This book was fascinating.  This book was horrifying.  This book's premise is that Obesity/Diabesity .. will be the #1 Worldwide affliction shortly.  And with it comes Billions or Zillions in costs for medical care .. or still-alive but in serious need of medical care with all the heart, kidney, blood vessel complications.  There is a premise in the book that the food industry has manipulated all these packaged foods that one becomes addicted and can't live without it.  Well I can live without 95% of it and I will attest, for the last 9 years, since I lost 48 lbs and am healthily slender .. that one CAN live without this junk + all the additives.  You can do it.  If you start to read the labels, and realize what you are putting into your body .. I promise you, most of you CAN do it.<br /><br />You know, if it has a label, chances are you probably shouldn't be eating it.<br /><br />It won't stop my friends.  All the Giant Food Companies, they have hundreds of billions of dollars invested in selling this junk.  If we all got healthy .. Nestle, General Mills, Kraft, Phillip Morris, all of them .. would go under.  Money, profit, Wall Street, all of it .. designed to keep you hooked.  And when you get hooked, chances are you and your Doctor will be partners for life .. until you get smart.<br /><br />As an added note, I also learned about the advertising agency that cooked up the marketing for this garbage.  Who knew it was a man at Coke that came up with the idea to package a hamburger + soda and not the McD company itself.  Wow.  And then somebody threw in the fries too .. cuz when it comes to us Americans .. betcha we can't eat just one ...<br /><br />Please read it.  Amazing research, a ton of science to support the studies.  Please please, just read it.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Tried it. Did not like it. Tried it again and still did not like it. It seems to be filled with a lot of annoying and useless information.
B00957T6X6|5.0|A great read that moves very quickly- don't be intimidated by the size.<br />The book is much better than the HBO series.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I got this for my 4 year old niece and she loved it.  There are a lot of small pieces but she does these projects with her dad. Quick shipment and great price.
B005FC49MS|1.0|Description in title says Region A/B/C - This disc plays on Region B only. Region in description says A/1, B/2... This will not play on Region A/1 Blu-Ray players. Such a shame - because this is an excellent movie.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use this sharpener for my SOG knife and multi-tool, Leatherman and Gerber tools.  After cutting line, webbing, wood, bone and even opening cans, my knives are far better taken care of thanks to Smith's sharpener.  With 2 grades of sharpening, plus the ability to maintain my serrated blades, this tool would be worth twice what Smith charges.  Buy it and love it.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|One of my favorite bands ever! Love all the songs and really enjoy blasting it in my Jeep! Makes me smile and feel happy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved Christian and Anastasia story, could not stop reading the series and had them on my mind constantly. If you can get past all the exotic sex scenes and absorb their story it's very enchanting and you get sucked into their relationship. Now that I have  finished the trilogy I'm left wanting more of them and their life together
B00000I41G|5.0|If you like jazz guitar, this is a must have. Great Sunday morning brunch listening. It's great you will not be disappointed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|fun game to play alone or with others.  biggest problem is running out of lives and having<br /> to wait for more.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|For a Disney movie, I was deeply disappointed. They tackled a classic, and they decided to push the latest technology to the limits. Oh look at the pretty 3-D effects that we can afford!!! See how we push five+ minutes of pointless 3-D artwork your way.<br /><br />The story was okay, it wasn't great. I think James overacted a bit and killed it. The goof on graphics with the witch also was ill played by Disney. So disappointed. I know they could have done so much better! 2 1/2 stars<br /><br />The little China doll was worth seeing the movie for ;)
0843178159|5.0|These books are great. My 4 year old nephew has been collecting them and it is so fun to see his excitement when he gets a new one.
B009M1QRM8|3.0|Very predictable the action sequences were very lengthy.<br /><br />Very wordy which made it less exciting than it could have been
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. Its even better than beautiful disaster...and I loved bd.....Awesome book from an awesome author. Definitely a must read!
B002R88G5E|4.0|What a well told story. I really enjoyed this book and the style was so descriptive you could easily picture the characters and every scene.
B000EXZI1O|5.0|I like this album,<br />Contains the song:<br /><br />&#34;Tragedy&#34; ,<br />&#34;Too Mush Heaven&#34; ( which is my most favorite song in this album) ,<br />and lastly the song  &#34;Reaching Out&#34;.
0553382152|5.0|This book was published some time ago however, it is one book that left me wanting MORE. It would not be an understatement to say that this book changed my life. Very few NDE books are as detailed and descriptive as Betty Eadie's. I LOVE this book so much that when I lose someone I re-read this book. For YEARS I loaned this book to those in need of it's message BUT I could never get it back! Hence, I have re-purchased this book over and over again. I love it SO much!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a fun game that can be brought anywhere because all you need are the dice. It's a fast paced game that definitely gets people riled. So worth the price (which isn't really much at all).

B000FA675C|5.0|This is my favorite novel.  I have read it three times so far and have enjoyed it each time.  I have read all Dan Brown's novels. I have been reading for many,many years and have read most of the best fiction that is available.  This is one of the best that I have read as far as plot, characters, and degrees of suspense are concerned. Fiction with history intermingled in, is very enjoyable and educating.  Love it !!
B009LGO88E|4.0|I only play monster hunter 3 on 3ds, so this circle pad helps me a lot with that game, I suggest anyone who also play other action games may need one, but it is not really that necessary.<br /><br />And this circle pad is relatively expensive in terms of its work. it is just a simple device, and should be cheaper
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I want to rate it 1,000,000,000,000 stars. I play this game every day. It's very entertaining, and the graphics are amazing.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|These work just like they are suposed to work, a great product that is well worth the money, I love it.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|My book club read this one several years ago, and out of the 75+ books our group has read over the years, this one ranked in the top five. The story was so well written, with lots of twists and turns. It was unpredictable, and all the loose ends and story lines were nicely wrapped up by the end of the tale in unexpected ways. Outstanding read! I just talked myself into buying the e-book and reading it again!
B009X01C64|5.0|I absolutely love this cover.  I'm using my kindle mostly for games and reading books however, so the revolve feature and the handle on the inside of the cover is not really being put to use much.  The only con is that the outline of the handle on the inside of the cover marred the Zagg screen shield I also put on my kindle.  The Marware Vibe doesn't have the handle if this is an issue for you.  The case is very well made, a great color (I have purple, and makes my kindle nearly \\"accident proof\\".
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Kleon puts forth what I think are innovative thoughts and ideas on how artists have and continue to \\"steal\\" from each other and why it's perfectly ok to do so.  Found it both liberating and inspiring and I can't wait to get to work.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty darn good. The graphics are excellent, and the sounds are nice too!! I LOVE horses!! So, I may like this app more than people who don't have horses as their favorite animals.

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|This is not one of their best efforts, but not bad. Would not spent more than $1 on a used copy.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Unsurpassed film director, Steven Spielberg, produced another superb film, LINCOLN, which covers the last four months of President Abraham Lincoln's earthly life and is based on credible presidential historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, TEAM OF RIVALS: THE POLITICAL GENIUS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, which she researched for ten years.<br />  Based on my main interest of study, Abraham Lincoln, for a minimum of 46 years, I was uncommonly happy that this accurate docudrama informs audiences of the abundance of effort Lincoln continuously exerted to permanently outlaw slavery throughout the entire United States of America, the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution which was under the control of the then Congressmen.  To most people, Lincoln is mostly remembered for his issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, but the bulk of his efforts to smash slavery is not generally known.  This film also truly portrays Lincoln's exhaustion, partially by the strategic lighting of Lincoln's face periodically throughout the film.<br />  An exceptionally moving scene in the film is when Lincoln, splendidly portrayed by actor Daniel Day-Lewis, exits a room where he had been conversing business with a few other people, to leave for the theatre where he was fatally shot.  An African American White House staff member stands stationary with a facial expression of admiration for the man who tirelessly worked to free around 4 million people of this man's Black race, a goal recently reached, just watching Lincoln as Lincoln plods down a hallway, away from the scene, which turned out to be the last time this man saw Lincoln in this world.<br />  After Lincoln's demise, the film's artistic last scene is of Lincoln delivering the last several words of his Second Inaugural Address which has been nicknamed Lincoln's \\"Malice Towards None\\" speech which occurred nearly 6 weeks prior to Lincoln's death in this world.<br />  Many of the characters included in the film are very recognizable, professionally played by various actors/actresses.<br />  Although I am minimally wondrous that the average viewer is rather uninformed about the context and details of that time period which may slightly hinder these viewers' ability to follow the film's content, viewers can easily enough grasp the overall themes of the film -- the Civil War's carnage and the energy of many, largely of Lincoln, to end U. S. slavery forever.<br />  Even though this film does not contain an abundance of action as many present films incorporate, this film is sprinkled with humor throughout.<br />  I recommend that people see this important film, LINCOLN.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Beautiful story with reat characters. I loved how Anne bloomed from a mousy introvert to an attractive self confident woman.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I originally had my eye on the moto elite sliver. But the reviews were kind of mixed with many complaining. So I purchased this device. Nothing but good experiences with it its a great device. The only issue I have with it is simply the reason I originally lookes at the sliver. Id prefer a lower profile. I always hated seeing people walking around with ear pieces. Now im one od the biggest offenders :-).  If you would prefer a low profile device but want a devi e that works well. This wouls work for you. Your choice. We all know the pros and cons.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|So many actors are cast in this movie we had fun remembering all of them as we watched. Action plus an entertaining story line.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Ever wish you could hear Roman and Greek mythology re-told and still have Percy Jackson around?  Well, now you don't have to.  Great re-working of old stories.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I usually don't go for the love story. I didn't read the description, just the title when I downloaded this book because it was free so I didn't realize I was in a romance book until I was already invested in it and I'm so glad I was.  This was defiantly one of the best free books I've read! I had a hard time putting it down and had it finished before the day was over.  I found myself laughing out loud and frantically reading through the tense parts of the book.  It was a great read!!
B00005JKNF|4.0|You need a scorecard to figure out Who's Who in this movie and it moves very fast. Maggie Smith is wonderful and, yes, her performance in this Julian Fellowes script prefigures the type of character she plays in Downton Abbey. In that regard it is similar with upstairs-downstairs intrigues. But we could have used a little help identifying characters at the beginning. Once we figured out who was who with the help of a Wikepedia entry on the movie, we enjoyed it thoroughly. Robert Altman's directing is flawless, there isn't a weak performance in the film. Who knew Jeremy Northampton could SING? All is fine until the ending which disappoints. But what else can you expect from Fellowes who managed to kill off two of our favorite characters in Downton's last season! It could easily have been written with a much more satisfying conclusion!

B00338CMTI|5.0|I had to reorder this book, after a non-returned &#34;borrow.&#34;  It was just as good the second time around and now the series is complete again!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Of course, you really need to start with season 1, but it is a fantastic series in nearly every way.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This book was better on the whining scale than some of the recent past, maybe just a 4 out of 10, but still, Patricia, give up on the pity party.  It's not all about you.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|i love this book. once i started reading it i couldnt and didnt want to stop. It is a fantastic read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Wonderful read. DeMille intertwines a sense of humor and wit to wind through a tale of suspense.  I have been a DeMille fan for years, and this time, he raises the bar.  Great read.  Can't put it down page turner.

B0064T6LV8|1.0|The best game in this arcade was the under water arcade. Of course now with the update you need to pay the 2.99 to play it. Highly unfair with no warning. Am deleting and looking elsewhere.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|GREAT BOX SET.I NEVER GET TIRED OF SEEING THESE MOVIE'S I COULD WATCH THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN.THE PICTURE QUAILTY IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THERE AGE.R.KING
B00866H7SS|3.0|I can't work out if Gideon had been abused in the past or was the abuser. I like the way they work at resolving conflicts. I enjoyed the book very much.
B00005214X|4.0|I enjoyed \\"All Things Must Pass\\" when I first heard it almost 40 years ago. George Harrison had become a force to be reckoned with his Beatles compositions and outstanding guitar work. So it was no surprise his first post-Beatles work was a masterpiece. A serious, lofty collection that proved Harrison as a musician who could stand on his own. No disposible, bubblegum pop here. The songs reach for an idealistic standard only an artist with depth and vision can achieve.<br />Standout cuts include \\"Wah-Wah\\", \\"What Is Life\\", \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", \\"Beware Of Darkness\\" and the title track.<br />The weakness was the echoed, muddy sound the original LP possessed. The 2001 re-master improved things some, but I would preferred Harrison to have stripped it down (much like \\"Let It Be...Naked\\") Phil Spector's Wall of Sound obscured the intimacy of the album. \\"I Live For You\\" is the only new track of note - a warm, comfortable tune that should have replaced the lamest track on the original, \\"Isn't It A Pity - Version Two\\" or perhaps \\"Awaiting On You All\\".<br />My only other problem goes more to my taste. I tend not to like horns in rock songs. There's a lot of them here. Many musicians of the period went heavy with horns - using them to cover dead spots, just got lazy or lacked creativity and wanted to wash over the rhythm. The only song where they worked was \\"Hear Me Lord\\" with it's plaintive, soulful message. And the trumpet in \\"Wah-Wah\\" is effective, but they were leaned on too much throughout the album. I would have preferred more guitars.<br />My criticisms don't take away from the magnificence of Harrison's work. ATMP remains his showcase work.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|I loved this double album...a few hours of pure jazz pleasure..brought back memories of why I fell in love with jazz as a teen listening to NYC radio from midnight to 2AM..Long live the Brubecks!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book just &#34;grabs&#34; the reader immediately.  If you liked 50 shades of grey, you'll like this book even better.  I just couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to see how this would end....the good &#34;girl&#34; wins!!  I'll read other books by this author.

B00821OX98|5.0|I hated when the season ended.  This is really an interesting show.  I can hardly wait for the new season.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always Grisham delivers a page turning novel that one can't put down.bought this book when it was first released but as with all of Grisham novels I take my time and read only  a few chapters a month to prolong my enjoyment  of great story telling  by a great storyteller. I gave this  novel the highest rating because of this.
B008476HBM|5.0|If you are looking for a book to get lost in, this is it. It is a wonderful read. I would suggest this for anyone.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Over 30 years later not only do they put out a wonderful album that is true to Depeche Mode, it is also a beautifully passionate album that keeps up with the times. Absolutely blown away!
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Definitely a must watch, and definitely one of the best vampire movies ever. If you want to watch something that you'll want to watch again, this is it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|COULD BE THE BEST BOND YET,VERY VERY GOOD MOVIE GREAT PICTURE AND AUDIO KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOU SEAT RIGHT FROM THE START.YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING THIS MOVIE.R.KING
B0036UW09U|5.0|The acting was superb, by both stars.  I fell in love with Kris Kristopherson just watching the movie.  I never saw it when it first came out and only now know what I missed.  It was easy to see how Barbra Streisand's character fell in love with him and wanted to help him.  Too bad the character didn't realize how self-destructive he had become and how urgent help was needed.  I knew how it was going to end when I first saw the car swerve.  This was a joyous movie to watch, with a heartbreaking end.  I was sad to learn that the movie somewhat paralleled Kris's real life.  Too much drink but, he didn't kill himself.  He was a heartthrob and at his prime in this movie. The only thing I didn't care for in this movie was the choice of music that Barbra sang - most of it.  I just didn't care for it although, many of her songs I like very much.  Perhaps, the ones I like were recorded later, I don't know. This movie should go down in history as a classic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. Its a perfect little horse game. It has great graphics. And it is so easy to get gems without having to buy them.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|Wow.  I cannot believe I had not gotten in to this band sooner.  Fantastic high energy vibe, creative song craft, fresh and thoroughly enjoyable.
0143034901|5.0|i liked the prose,plot and characters. i have never heard of love being related to pork. ENOUGH OF A MYSTERY TO KEEP THE PLOT MOVING.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT STAYS WITH YOU.  EVERYONE I HAVE HAD WATCH IT HAD THE SAME REACTION--JUST KIND OF AN ALL OVER FEELING OF WONDER AND HOPE.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This made everything easier and in some cases, better than Kindle's own instructions. When I discovered some embarrassing typos and had to edit them, it was much easier to follow these instructions than what I found on the Kindle site. My one suggestion, though, is please warn readers that they must use MS Word as MS Word Starter does not have the option of a Table of Contents - or at least warn them that MS Word Starter is not the same as MS Word. I had no idea when I started that I would have this problem, however, I have some lovely friends who let me use theirs to upload my book and add a T of C from their computer.
B001ET0826|4.0|Love Love Love this cd especially Space and Letitgo.  Even though it was widely panned I am a hardcore PrinceFam and I play this album allll the time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my son and i spend hours playing this game...it is so addictive!!!<br />they need to make the star wars version free too.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I received the movie rather quickly and it was nicer than expected. The package is really nice and the content, of course, is even better. There's this thing halfway through the movie which the editors forgot to remove, but you can completely overlook that. This movie is worth every dollar.
B00005TT77|5.0|Arrived in a timely manner, GREAT music.  Enjoying this CD.  This is a great way to listen to beatles music sung by a variety of artists.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I had to watch this in 2 parts so maybe I just didn't get &#34;into&#34; the story like I should, but with all the backstory, I expected more.  The whole story can be summed up in - I am a god who has never been challenged! Don't smash things. OK I am completely reformed of my arrogance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing subway suffers because I love getting all the mystery boxes and getting keys I play with friends and get money from it cool right I like trying to beat my friends high score I also like how the inspector changes out fits do to the holidays one more thing I like getting all knew people and upgrading the place you play well that's all I have to say.
B00515M23M|4.0|Some problems re quality of printing.  Otherwise, fine.  Bought for a class I took. Liked the portability on my Kindle.
0792156684|4.0|It is a great movie!We love it!The only thing is I wanted it in full screen and we could only find widescreen.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Movie was good. Worth watching once, not my favorite Eastwood movie.  There were a few good laughs but otherwise somewhat serious.  Quality was perfect.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I am looking forward to reading more of this author's books. This was a really nice surprise. I am always a little nervous when trying a new author. But this one is a keeper.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is very nice it is spectacular for a kindle fire HD and I love how you can take care of the horse and name it and just experience how to take care of horses and it (believe it or not) could be helpful in real life, 5 stars :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The writing is wonderful. The way ordinary words are put together and the imagery had me rereading phrases and smiling.  I loved the story.  Nazi Germany is background to the characters, horrific enough without too many explicit specifics. Shows how people can live their lives without &#34;stuff.&#34; Most of us would fall apart having to live the way they did in the story.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|A different kind of movie. great music, a bit of the supernatural. Ralph Macchio, not just the karate kid. enjoyable.
B0002EXH40|5.0|Great album with definitely one of the best mixings I have ever had the pleasure to behold. Max Norman is a genius. All instruments sound brutal, deep and detailed to no end. Junior finally gets his long deserved spotlight for the great bassist he is. Guitars sound mighty and Dave snarls and foams in a most convincing manner (tks to mixing again). Even if you do not dig Megadeth this is worthy as a masterclass in rock sound, grab the best pair of headphones you can find and enjoy the ride.
B00AUU2KI0|4.0|Pi, the only survival of a shipwrecked, was trapped on a lifeboat for 227 days along with a 450-pound Bengal tiger. True, this is a ridiculous story that almost resembles nothing real in this world. Yet through the imaginative figures, especially animals, Yann Martell successfully challenges the public belief of human nature. As a Hindu boy who also accepts Christianity and Islam, the resource of Pi's faith is from his pure love of God. Yet the God response his pious love in a brutal way: Pi was adrift in the ocean along with a hungry tiger who intends to attack Pi all the time. Personally, I see the tiger as the irrational side of Pi while Pi himself represents his rational side as a human. Initially, Pi feared the tiger, meaning that he first tried to repress his most original side of human nature by rationality. Yet the despair situation brought Pi and tiger some positive interaction. As Pi tamed the tiger, he even saw it as his soul mate. At this moment, rationality and beastliness coexist. In fact, it is this original human instinct that saves Pi from the disaster. Eventually when Pi stepped on the land, the tiger left, without even looking back at Pi. Pi thus returned to the modern society with full rationality. Through this imaginary journey, Yann Martel arouses an essential question: what is the essence of human nature? Evil? Good? Or they coexist? The interpretation of each individual reader may be different, but with no doubt, this is truly a book that will \\"make you believe in God\\".
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is probably the best alarm clock I have found for my kindle, wakes me up perfectly everyday for work!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a hell of a show. Great! Love it. Can't wait to see the other seasons. Suspenseful and great acting.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's a cables and it works. What more can I say,<br />Nine more words required! Well my Oh my! End.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is fun to play. It is a challenge and fast paced. I really enjoy it. If you like racing games you will like this and have fun with it.
0345803485|3.0|It is not my favorite book to read but it is a book that will keep your attention.  It is very interesting.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|The book was ok. I started it right after pride and prejudice. In my humble opinion, if you are someone with not much patience, put this book down. The book starts off with excessive and rich detail, but didn't get to the topic until half way through. Couldn't see where the story is heading to until the last two chapters. I think the conclusion was a little sloppy, for I just don't see how love is restore within few undistinguished interaction between the main characters. Maybe I was too fond of the well defined, lively characters of pride and prejudice, not really used to such \\"love and be silent\\" story.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am addicted to this game. Can always squeeze in a couple of games while waiting. Just wish it had fewer pop-up. Have learned a lot about the game and appreciate that it keeps score for me.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|I love books that immerse us into understanding of a place, time, and psychology. This one about Indian society is immensely captivating. So impressed with how a young author would have this level of perceptiveness and such talent to convey harsh realities in such a gripping way.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the size of the screen and ease of use. The way it is lite on the Kindle makes useable most any were you need a calculator. I love the size, easy to read screen and ease of use.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Awesome terentino! I would recommend this to anyone, it's the only movie I have ever seen in the theaters twice!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had reservations about this book, so it took a while for me to read it. I have  to admit, it is graphic, but a great read! The ending makes you want to keep reading! Can't wait to get the other two.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|Just an all around great album. Picked it up for Pumped Up Kicks but was pleasantly surprised by the great quality of the other tracks. Recommended!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I haven't used it and am not sure why I need it.  Utube seems to work OK without special software.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Does just what it is supposed to, masks outside noises. I guess the dripping faucet noise is just for fun, or maybe if I wanted to stay awake!
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This e-book was so touching and heart felt. It showed me how much one rude comment could tear someone's life apart completely .
B0012HEB32|5.0|A welcome back story for the franchise, look forward to season 2. Big fan of the lady Terminator as well.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Sturdy, long, sleek connectors... standard microUSB.<br /><br />Silicon insulation... great cable.. my choice as microusb cable... have 4 or 5 now...
B00003CXRP|2.0|I liked the movie and the story line of it but the reason I gave it two stars is on the one I bought it started skipping about a quarter of the way into the movie but Amazon gladly took it back and refunded me my money I'm planing on buying another copy of this movie it's a great family movie no nude scenes or cuss words the skipping is the only problem I had with it
B00867GKIK|5.0|Two thumbs up for UP. It is a charming well written story with very good 3D rendering. We enjoyed it very much.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Bought the app for my Fire and even bought the &quot;World pass&quot; for another buck. Got a total of five worlds with ten levels, which I finished in an hour. Am I missing something? is there more? Really enjoyed it but seems like very little for two bucks...
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter loves Polly, Playmobil and Etc.<br /><br />These kits give her the opportunity to play with small dolls at the same time that builds a Lego<br /><br />Good quality and nice set! Great gift for girls!
B00005LK94|5.0|I really love this movie great story, great acting , story line is easy to follow , would make a great family night movie
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Same style as the other books in the series.  Suspendful and informative if you like information about the military, guns and the M.P.'s
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love city building games. So when I read about this game I knew it was a find items listed kind of game. I love it. I have been having fun. I get upset when my time runs out. It is a game that could keep you playing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The criticism on the topic &#34;reality shows x reality&#34; and on the opression of the working class is fantastic. You just need to open your eyes a little bit to see all the things we hate about modern society being shown in this book...<br /><br />On the other hand, you can always read it like a teenager and have a wonderful adventure time! Lots of emotions at stake here!<br /><br />It is up to you... My tip: open your mind to see how this book compares to reality at some times.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Like the suspense. The government had a chance to screw this up glad they didn't. Really liked the gutsy decision he took. I've been in a position like that but not on that scale and it worked out, so I can relate
B005LLSZNM|3.0|We have enjoyed this series, but lately it is just getting depressing.  Hopefully the next season will improve, and the characters will be more engaging.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I love this Case it is the perfect fit If you have a Kindle Fire I suggest you get this case
B00BDAP66E|3.0|it's dandy!  fricken fantastic!  weird &amp; wonerful! what else am I supposed to say?  you keep telling me I have this new message, and won't go away till I write a damnable review!  well, there!  now go away and let me use the damnable page please!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was hoping for more about his life, so it was not what I expected. It was just ok. Thankyou
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun it's just like temple run . I like subway surfer even more.<br />The up grades are really good . There are lots of different people . This game has lots of things you can buy.
B00B8O4VHU|5.0|It would be disgusting if i dare to rate this product as a common one. It;s nothing but excellent. Regards.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Smart writing, complicated charismatic characters (even Van Houten), authentic tragedy in our human plodding toward love and oblivion. Great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and the graphics on it are awesome the horses look so real I love this game it lets you take care of a horse and care for it
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a good game for kids because there is nothing bad about it so parent if your kids ask say yes and it is FREE.
B003162R7E|5.0|It would be disgusting if i dare to rate this product as a common one. It's nothing but excellent. Regards.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my 2nd time reading this book & I think it's even better the 2nd time around. Suzanne Collins  writing is so detailed that you ARE there alongside Katnis giving her strength & willing her to continue the fight....I'm exhausted... can't wait for the movie!!!
B004U8VX2M|2.0|It was suggested that this series was much like Downton Abbey--we didn't think it was even close.<br />If you have trouble with English accents, you'll probably not like this.  When we watched Downton<br />we turned on closed captioning.  There was no closed captioning available with this and we missed lots of the dialogue.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|As long as your desktop/laptop is on, this is a great way to expand memory capacity for a Kindle.  Easy to install and use.
B00797MB0O|2.0|Not really worth the time to watch it.  Some funny moments, but that's about all I got for ya.  Thumbs down.
B00C32R64G|5.0|I love this new album. It has a strong western theme but comes with the volbeat melodies and jamin out that you would expect. It Will not let you down.
B000WBZZB6|3.0|I didn't pay close enough attention to the product details.  I have wasted my money.  CHECK THE REGION INFO CAREFULLY.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is just as involved and complicated as the Crush,, great graphic lay outs. Love the fact u can use Zen mode to work on puzzles and relax or not.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I could watch this movie again and again. I saw this musical  on Broadway it was exceptional then! Then I saw the  film. It  was spectacular. this is a must see film.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|I was not disappointed when I played my new  CD of The Jazz Age by The Bryan Ferry Orchestra. I felt as though I had stepped back in time and was sitting in one of the famous Jazz Clubs of the 1920s. Amazingly the Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music songs, although recognisable, could easily be from this fabulous jazz era due to the clever and masterful arrangements. Love this collection and would be thrilled if it were followed up with another selection of Ferry written songs given the same classy treatment.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Ivan finally gets to be the hero and get the girl he deserves! Bujold is at the top of her form in this one; any reader of the Vorkosigan saga will thoroughly enjoy Ivan's accidental marriage turned love of his life.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I laughed, cried, and took pause to ponder the stories within this book.. The characters were developed with such intimacy and thoughtful detail you can't help but connect with them and share a glimpse of their world.  I very much enjoyed reading, you will too!
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never read a novel in my adult life and now at 38 I can honestly say I couldn't put these books down. That's all I wanted to do was read.  Fantastic book!  Maybe I will start reading more now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I began reading Wool Omnibus it felt as though I was transported to a different world entirely.  Almost as if I had been dropped into a Bradbury novel.  At first everything seems ok but the more time you spend in the world the more you start to see the cracks in the society.  Highly enjoyed the characters especially Jahns, Juliette, and Walker.  Wool was hard to put down, and I kept picking up my kindle to finish the story.
B00138H876|5.0|Dylan at his best. Great songs and lyrics that define his many moods. One of my favories of all time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Card is one of the best sci-fi writers. I love his work, and this is definitely a great read.  Would recommend to anyone who likes a book you just can't put down.
B0016492BW|1.0|Got through to the menu, hit play, nothing happens, player stays on \\"menu\\"<br />This is the second dvd for this title.  Returning again.  Update, mia culpa, I downloaded an update to my blu-ray player and the dvd works perfectly.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Mystery, magic, supernatural, and the incredible all rolled into one story.  Throughout the read it felt as though I was a fly on the wall soaking up all the drama that happened.  Highly recommend this story!
B00BY7NK96|5.0|An inspiring book that had me thinking long and hard about so many things. A must read by all women and men who are serious about equality.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you don't like this, never bother reading fiction again.  I only really read non-fiction and this was such a joy.  It is a must read.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|They say that Bing is better, I tried to switch my Kindle search engine from Bing to Google, Bing sucks major ass!
1451648537|5.0|of course this is a 5 star rating.  It is STEVE JOBS.<br />He turned Apple around [basically saving them] and revolutionized arguably everyone that has a smartphone....we wouldn't have the amazing computers, tablets, or phones that we have without Steve Jobs and this book explains the highs and lows of getting there!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Eh. They acted more like 11-year-olds than college students. Their emotional maturity was annoying and the writing was disjointed. An adequate beach read.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is so much better than most weekly network shows and having the DVD allows you to watch at your pace, with subtitles if you need them and to review as you choose.  We ordered the next season as soon as we completed the first!
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Very nice! The graphics are great, the game play is smooth, the music fits the situation. For a Kindle HD  app it's over the top. For the golfer guy this is too cool, for the adrenalin junkey still in the hospital, you can live vicariously though this app as you plan your next adrenalin pumping gig.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Once I picked up this book to start the Trilogy, I couldn't put it down. It's certainly a very quick page turning book. I will admit, book 3 was a little harder to follow and to keep interested in and a bit less believable, but good none the less.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great application and was just what I was looking for: A sleep timer! For those who need some kind of sound to go to sleep, it can easily be set to turn off after you expect to be asleep. The greatest part is how you can just click any combination of sound icons. For example rain AND melody, or orchestral AND ocean.  If you don't like how that combination sounds, you just hit the \\"x\\" and try something else. Love the sound of crickets? They're in there! This app was very well designed. Great sound and easy to use---I just love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this temple run app is so fun and it doesn't freeze up that bad. no apps perfect and this app is awesome!! get temple run 2 so much better than temple run 1!!!!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I love scifi shows & some crime shows, this has both. It even makes you think if what they describe in the show is possible, so it gives you sense of realism & possibility.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Okay, so I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and have read everyone of his books to date...that being said, did I like it? Of course, it's Nicholas Sparks and I'm a fan of those sappy love stories. But, his books are becoming very predictable. I enjoyed this book but was it on the same level of The Notebook and The Wedding? No, but I think those would be hard to compete with.
0439023491|5.0|I bought this for my daughter. She loves the series, and this was a great deal on this nice hardcover book. She loved it!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I really did like this book. It was recommended by my daughter. Now I can not wait to watch the movie.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I recently picked up a Kindle Fire HD and was looking for an app that would replace Google's Currents app that I was so used to using on my old Nexus 7. After trying Flipboard and finding it less feature-rich than I'd hoped, I downloaded Feedly and gave it a shot. The app is simply amazing for what it does, which is organize your RSS feeds into a beautiful magazine-like format. Of course you can also change the interface to look like the traditional Google Reader format (titles only), or you can also make it look and behave just like Currents if that's more your thing.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Feedly web app behaves mostly in the same manner as this Kindle Fire app, making for a seamless experience across platforms.<br /><br />In conclusion, Feedly is a great Google Reader/Currents replacement, but also it's just a great RSS reader period. Highly recommended.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book will keep you up all hours of the night reading because once you start, you can not put it down. I love Dan Brown's writing style!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie covers only a small portion of Lincoln's life but it covers a historical event in the US slavery issue.  The great acting brings to life the personalities and events surrounding this issue... very worth watching.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I have this game for both mobile and kindle for my phone it works just fine but for my kindle it freezes and completely stops working. My kindle has to force close it all the time. I don't know if its just mine but I would not recommend this game on kindle. I'm giving it two stars only because it is a fun game but the kindle app does not work well for me.
0694003611|2.0|Am I the only person that thinks this book is freaking weird? I'm not sure why so many love it or dram it a &#34;classic.&#34; I bpught this book thinking it was something else and boy was I disappointed. Maybe I'm just too critical but when two of the pages are, &#34;Goodnight nobody and goodnight air&#34; I just think its weird? I guess it's a little catchy and fine for a quick bedtime story but I'm blown away at how little substance the book has both in verbiage and art and yet how popular it is. Strange.

B00B7Y0206|5.0|This YouTube App For Kindle Fire Is Excellent. The videos When Watching Are Crystal Clear, Unlike Watching On The YouTube WebSite Sometimes They Are Really Blurry. You Get Your PlayList And Everything That The Website Has, But A Lot Better Quality Picture, Love This App !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once you have seen the first two seasons, the third is  such a treat. It is pure enjoyment. I enjoyed the reaction to change that we all deal with in our lives. This season gave a wonderful look into the changes to the life of aristocrats after the WWI.

B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|‘The Hobbit- an unexpected journey’ is probably one of the best films ever made to match a great work of literature. I loved everything about it: the music, the storyline, the special effects, the chorography, the choice of characters, the acting, and the chilling suspense. It was simply perfect. The film begins slowly and an easy going atmosphere of an ideal harmonious life, and as it unfolds one gets the feeling of an illusive euphoria. However, the genius filmmaker managed to infuse the viewer with the comprehensive sense of imminent danger despite the euphoric ambiance. I must admit, I enjoyed this film better than its subsequent trilogy. Respect, Peter Jackson, well done.
1250012570|5.0|I have never read and book like this.<br />First off, I am a teen and have never been in love. This book doesn't just make me want something like Eleanor and Park's relationship but it makes me feel like I can and it makes me feel like I am in their relationship, as well.<br />I laughed and cried during this book and when I finished it my heart was throbbing. When I first heard of this book, I wasn't sure if I would like it. I'm not really in to romance novels. But this...this isn't just a romance novel... it's a love story and a comedy and it fills you with the evangelical zeal.<br />I want to share this book with the world and I want to keep it to myself.<br />No matter how many people read this book, it will always be mine.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|i had bought this for an upcoming trip to NYC....it performed flawlessly...camera is ready to be unholstered when you are. after wearing it for a while i didn't even notice,i had it on....i carried a 5dm2 and 17-40 L lens and walked around with it for hours, every day....quality materials and well thought out...went to LA the following week and carried a 5dm2 with a 70-200 L lens...other than a heavier lens, the unit was still balanced...this is one of those products that you never thought of, and now you can't believe you can go without it....no more neck aches, no more shifting strap from one shoulder to the other. only one word of warning....remember you have something on your hip so in tight quarters be cautious...after a while, its a natural.....highly recommend to all...

B009X01ELC|2.0|I just got the case for the new Kindle Fire 8.9HD and I honestly do not like it.  My new Fire keeps popping out of the case which is unacceptable, at least to me.

B009VMN3RA|2.0|The book lets a person know what a terrible childhood Sachi had.<br />Shirley MacLaine was the worst mother possible.  The book leaves<br />the reader sad, aching for Sachi and the mother-daughter connection<br />that she never had.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|The book was recommended by a multitude of sources. So i decided to finally read it.<br /><br />The book comes in two parts; first(originally published separately as \\"From Death-Camp to Existentialism\\") a deeply personal, experiential account of life in a concentration camp; beginning thus:<br /><br />\\"This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events, but of personal experiences, experiences prisoners have suffered time and time again....... it will try to answer this question: How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner\\" (3)<br /><br />Therefore the account is often first person, footnotes are few and far between, and the prisoners presented as they feel, not as some impersonal scientific descriptions out there, and not as the alien figures portrayed in film. Therefore the text often is a weave a tangents instead of a coherent thought process; yet this comes off as endearing and eminently readable. So instead of distilling the ideas, i will just offer up some quotes;<br /><br />\\"Sensitive people who were used who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less.\\" (36)<br /><br />\\" .... I saw the truth as it has been set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth-that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire.\\"(37)<br /><br />During this part of the book he comes to the core of his thought on the meaning of live;<br /><br />\\"Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\" (77)<br /><br />Such is the first section.<br /><br />The Second is a brief description of logo therapy, the school of psychoanalysis brought into being by Frankl himself.<br /><br />I really cannot possibly summarize the summary, so i will instead just give its definition; A therapy that considers man's fundamental drive to be meaning.<br /><br />The book is amazing, it's view of the meaning of life both profoundly post-modern and and universally applicable, no matter what ones religion, and its account of experiences in the death camp deeply moving.ive its definition; A therapy that considers man's fundamental drive to be meaning.<br /><br />The book is amazing, it's view of the meaning of life both profoundly post-modern and and universally applicable, no matter what ones religion, and its account of experiences in the death camp deeply moving.

B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I wouldn't recommend it to my 14 year old granddaughter but I like the music a lot and I try not to pay too much attention to the bad language or content of some of the &#34;R&#34; songs.
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|Very very frustrated that I can't get several of these to \\"show up\\" so I can download them.  I've gone to \\"apps\\"  \\"cloud\\"...and they still don't show up.  I get email saying that I have them though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is extremely fun and very addicting I find it to be very time consuming especially on long drives or plane rides.... So get this game it's worth it... I mean it's free why not?
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Powerful, moving music for all ages.  I have usually enjoyed Depeche Mode and found this disc solid and well worth adding to my collection.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I hope her success continues, love her voice, liked most of the songs too. She could be one of those long lasting artists.
B0088W6Y7K|4.0|Love the Vegas episode, wish they could have been allowed to wrap up the series properly. Still love the interaction between John and Rodney.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Loved this book!  The voice and perspective were wonderful.  I could see every scene he wrote about . The ending left me wanting more!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded MLP awhile ago and I didn't expect much. But after playing for about a month I found that I really enjoy this game! The ponies are cute and the sounds aren't awful.<br />I did spend money on this game, certainly not 250$! I had to spend ten to get all six of the main characters.<br />If there's one thing that I need to stress, its an update for the Kindle Fire HD version of MLP. I can't connect to my friends' games because they have a different version.<br />UPDATE PLEASE! :D
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Excellent I loved each episode this is all based in history and the characters are so well presented that you immediately get attached to it. I certainly recommend it
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Poorly written and the same crap over and over. No excitement. The  entire series was poorly written. Dont  know why I even continued after the first book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best season so far. I think it is one of the best shows on TV. It is full of surprises. You never know when something is going to jump out at you.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Very tedious, very slow story development.  Not as good as Reacher #1 but it's OK.  Will read #3 to see if it gets any better.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Even though this book was released a few years back, many people recently recommended it and noted that it was one of their favorite books they'd read in awhile. While I liked the story, I didn't feel nearly as passionate about it as the people who had mentioned it to me did (or most of Amazon's reviewers, for that matter).<br /><br />I certainly appreciate the premise that books can sometimes be saviors and loved the \\"feel good\\" nature of Leisel sharing her love of books with other characters (particularly her neighbors as they hid in the bomb shelters).<br /><br />However, I think the book's structure was a detriment to Leisel's story. It begins with a huge section of the narrator's thoughts and him/her telling the readers about the three times he'd seen \\"the book thief\\" (i.e. Leisel). As I was reading it, it took me quite awhile to figure out who in the world the narrator was and, when I did, I was just perplexed. Why is the Angel of Death (or something like that...he/she is never explicitly mentioned by name) the narrator?? It just never made sense to me...even after I'd finished the book. I hated it so much that I thought if things didn't change fast, then I wasn't going to be able to keep reading.<br /><br />Things got better when we got into Leisel's story, but the constant return (at the beginning of each \\"section\\" and in asides throughout the book) of the Angel narrator pulled me out of the story and just plain drove me nuts. Had the story of Leisel and her world been told in a straightforward way, I think I would have liked the book more, though I still doubt I would have loved it as much as others did.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My kids got me into this series and I really enjoy the story.  Very well told with attention to detail without being too boring.  Never a dull moment and the twists and turns continue to shock.  Read this before watching the HBO series.
B0006J28KU|5.0|I love this version (w/all of the bonus features)!<br />  The package contains 3 theatrical trailers (disc one), 11 additional scenes,and 5 making-of documentaries (disc two).<br />  It's kind of interesting to learn that DeNiro's character, McCauley, is based on an actual guy, and you get to learn more about his story in one of the featurettes. Also, you learn that Pacino's character, Hanna, chips Cocaine as part of Pacino's preparation and backstory for the character. You also get to revisit some of the shooting locations. You get to learn how the movie's screenplay took 20 yrs to get it just right, how the cast trained for the big shootout, and details regarding &#34;the scene&#34; w/ Pacino & DeNiro.<br />  I definitely recommend this!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great Book, had a lot of awesome history in it. Loved the ending of the book, seems like a good author.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love them both. My sister and I can't stop playing it! My Dad approves it too! I hope they will make tons more.
B00785P2QC|1.0|too bad its become more about leaving feedback and posting on facebook than being able to enjoy the game!! also not a fan anymore because you cant play continuously, you only have so many turns and then you have to wait until you get more turns, which accumulate over hours.
B004EPZ08O|3.0|You would think that continuing to make another Final Destination, after one that's called The Final Destination, that they must have just had a great idea for it... not so much. I heard that there may be a FD6 & FD7 in the works. I just hope they're a lot better than this one, which does not suck by any means, it's just not quite up to par. If you're a collector of the franchise, why not buy it? Sure. But if this will your first time watching a movie from the franchise, I suggest watching them in chronological order, and just buy it if you've already got the first 4.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I really never liked Rhianna but this CD definately changed my mine when it comes to her music.  Great CD!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. this like my favrite game ever and I'm going to play it all the time this game rocks
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love the way the characters show the dificulties of change.  The style of clothes for the women is marvelous.  Can't wait for it to come back around.  The existing plots have so many directions in which to go.  I am in full anticipation.

B00006GA4C|5.0|I don't know why I dismissed Grand Funk as a band for my rock collection. Outstanding guitar, bass and drums and hard rockin' songs. I blast this CD in my car, as I can't play it too loud at home, otherwise the neighbors will call the cops on me.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The vocals were not dubbed but recorded during actual filming.  The actors sang live during filming and that was the tack used I'm the film.  The emotion was better captured in the song and the acting was more directly affected bu the song.  Wonderful movie depiction of the highly regarded broadway musical. However, I would have casted Gerard Butler as Inspector Javer for singing.  Russell Crowe's acting was excellent.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I enjoy the British productions.  The characters are straight forward in speech, and are quite witty in their truthfulness.  No political correctness.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I loved the first Iron Man and the sequel does not disappoint. Action packed. Fun for your whole family. Love the soundtrack, too.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I always wanted to own the original, uncut, &#34;Leon: Version Integrale.&#34; as it is known in France. Now the film makes sense,with all the restored footage. I won't even bother watching the theatrical version, which I've seen before.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Steve McQueen is so suave and smart, you can't help but fall in love with him.  But, Faye Dunaway is smarter, almost.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book but was disappointed by the ending. The beginning and middle had me excited for a great finish and it seemed a bit &#34;safe&#34;.
B008602KQI|2.0|Saw the movie after it was highly recommended to me by a friend. I didn't see what was so great about it. Made me think of Battle Royale when I heard the premise but it wasn't as good in an over-the-top silly way as that movie. This movie is a bit more serious but harder to believe in at the same time. Maybe a sequel where the overthrow the government would be better. To me, the movie was meant for teenage or younger girls. Not on the level Twilight was mind you but maybe between Twilight and Harry Potter.
1595827684|5.0|The book was great for all Mass Effect fans, but i wish they show more stuff and characters anyway the book stills awesome though. Highly recommended!!!!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is great for horse lovers, or if you just like caring games. I think that it is worth getting it, even though it is free.
B000002LRX|5.0|I actually was not a huge Faith No More fan before hearing this album. I was a fan of Mr. Bungle and I liked FNM's Epic single, but that was all. I'd heard a previous alubum (maybe their first?) and thought it was pretty rough and not complex at all.<br /><br />This album on the other hand is absolutely fantastic. It is complex, blends many different genre's of music, and is fantasticly constructed and executed. I instantly loved it and I like it more and more every time I listen to it. This is in my daily rotation and I highly reccomend it.
B001ED8QRQ|5.0|A previous reviewer stated that there is no difference between this and the 40th anniversary edition. On VHS Video there is!  This later version (2009) is THX Mastered for the sound - which the previous VHS tape version (2004)  wasn't.  :)

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book just like I did every other book in the series and I couldn't keep my eyes off of this book<br />I rated this book a 5 out of 5 because it makes you want to cry the deaths of some characters and then laugh at some of the things they say<br />I would recommend this book for anyone who loves action and danger and most importantly ROMANCE ;)
B005HS00NW|5.0|Sounds just like they did in concert. The music is beautifully atmospheric. Good to have in the foreground or background. There's something about M83 that reminds me of Mazzy Star, the Cocteau Twins, and the Miami Vice theme song all rolled into one. I think it's the sax in Midnight City...That may sound crazy but it isn't I swear. Shoe-gazing, retro 80s, but forward thinking all at the same time. Love.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Good read and insight on training. I myself, am on the first week of the program from this book. The majority of the supplements mentioned I already have and been taking. And you're right to hit on the basic power and muscle building exercises to build strength, power, and mass. Trying to keep consistent in my training, which has been my problem over the years and trying to \\"cut\\" up.<br />Thanks Mike, good book and will look up you're other books for more information.
B004I744AS|5.0|What a great app. Languages galore with translations, a legal dictionary that I find to be a very useful tool and a start page that can be designed to your liking from a menu of fun and interesting games, tools, utilities and more.

0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has the most amazing worldbuilding skills--he creates an entirely plausible universe, with laws for magic that seem convincing enough to be possible and characters who are so real that I have to resist searching for them on Facebook. I am an avid reader of fantasy (I even did my senior thesis on fantasy literature), and Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles are the most gripping, well-written, heart-wrenching fantasy books I have ever read. I've read Name of the Wind several times, Wise Man's Fear once, and I plan to go back and enjoy them many more times. They are both must-reads!!!

B006OV7RQ4|5.0|This was such a great movie. The whole cast was phenomenal. If you are looking for easy answers and a neat ending you may not enjoy this kind of movie. I particularly enjoy the fact that it leaves you with questions. Elizabeth Olsen gives a great performance of a young women slowly falling apart and John Hawkes gives us another outstanding performance of a charismatic yet menacing man.I tell everyone I know to watch this movie. It will not disappoint.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Lydia is 40 and still lives at home with her mum. Jamie is 41 and lives alone. The two are destined to meet. This is a sad and at times difficult to read story. Difficult because of some of the harsh realities of life in an Irish catholic orphanage.

0307352145|5.0|What can I say more than what has already been said very well in so many good reviews already on this site?<br /><br />Well, I can add that this book made an outstanding basic textbook for an eight-week discussion group studying introversion. We were a dozen retired seniors, all coming from a variety of successful professional careers (mostly in scientific and high-technology fields). All of us, it turned out, were introverts.<br /><br />The “class” was affiliated with an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) where we organize group discussions and presentations around a strong peer-learning concept. Before each class session, we read one or two chapters from this book and then had discussion based on questions prepared by one or two of our members about those chapters. In addition, we listened to, and discussed, one or two presentations prepared by members. Most of the presentations used PowerPoint, but some were lectures. All the presentations dealt with topics related to introversion, many were suggested by ideas culled from the book. Our OLLI has found that this is a good format for casual academic group learning, especially in an environment where almost everyone already has an advanced degree. Basically, we rely on learning through individual reading and research, and enhance that learning by sharing it with peers.<br /><br />At the end of the class, we agreed that Susan Cain’s book was outstanding; it appeared to be well researched and definitely was thoroughly enjoyable. The book easily supported our casual academic format, and when we needed more detailed information, we found that most research facts were documented and supported in forty-six pages of detailed annotated notes at the end.<br /><br />All of us felt that this book taught us a great deal about how introversion has affected the course of our lives and the significant choices we’ve made.<br /><br />We also all felt that our society would be better off if all teachers and parents were encouraged to read this book.<br /><br />Reading the book alone would have been a satisfactory experience, but having had the experience to read this book in a group setting, along with other retired successful introverted peers, was an experience that I shall long treasure. Naturally, based on ideas gathered from the book, we ending up sharing with each other a great deal about our personal lives. Introverts don’t often find it easy or pleasant to talk about themselves, but in this setting, with this book, and with these people, it was a magnificent, life-affirming experience. I recommend reading this book. I also recommend using this book in a class setting such as the one I described. I am sure this format would work for any age group.encouraged to read this book.<br /><br />Reading the book alone would have been a satisfactory experience, but having had the experience to read this book in a group setting, along with other retired successful introverted peers, was an experience that I shall long treasure.

B008K5T5AI|5.0|How can he do it? Another great novel by Mr Banks, and as usual gets you involved, that work and life interferes with the reading.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|it's ok dumb stupid boaring need to get to the next level my x boyfriend is a tiny fat idiot and needs
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Our book club read this book - and everyone reallly enjoyed this one.  The story line kept my interest - and I was anxious to learn the outcome for the main character.  I love historical fiction.....and because this one had a different viewpoint from the traditional &#34;cival war&#34; stories - I will remember this one for a long time.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Wonderful telling of the story of a kid who struggles with being noticed because he looks different. I love the fact that it is told by different perspectives.
B002SAS26E|5.0|Our family loves games, we have over 300 to choose from. We enjoy Jaipur so much, that I just bought a second set so we could all play at the same time. My daughters are 9 and 5, and my 5 yr old picked it up with no problem from watching one game played. She can even understand some of the strategy and has won fair and square more than once. She is very smart and like I said, we play games quite often. I would not say this is a game to buy with a 5 yr old in mind. Both of my girls request this game and \\"Hike\\" most often. A definite recommend!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best app that anyone could possibly buy. I could play it for hours.<br />If you want to download an awesome game, buy minecraft cuz it's plain BOSS!!!!!!!!!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I had not read this book in school, but found it on a list of \\"must reads\\" recently.  An interesting storyline that kept me glued to the last page.  Can't wait to read more from this quartet.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|I had never heard of them but a friend absolutely raved about them so I gave it a try.  For us Seniors, they are absolutely teriffic! My granddaughter was singularly unimpressed.  At lad... Music for old guys (and gals)!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I enjoyed this film immensely.  The cameo appearance of a Clint Eastwood-like character was a great touch.  And almost any film that has Johnny Depp, a hero-dreamer, romance, plot twists and makes me laugh out loud will get a 5-star rating from me!
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I'm not sure why I would use this app. I've not seen anything it gives me over just doing Facebook directly in the browser, except it gives me ads. I'll just stick with the browser.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is so great .It's a puzzle that you can still have fun with. It's so totally worth the 0.99. If you love a challenge this is a game for you.
B00846F1YW|4.0|one of the better ones. I like the variety of games inside the game. I'm actually enjoying the storyline as well.
B0001I561E|5.0|Been waiting for Disney to release BLuray dvd set but guess their holding there crud tight until then got this for my wofe and she's totally happy!  Came in great condition, no loose or flying aroound discs in the set, which makes me feel that proper care was taken with packing and delivery
B0029LCJJS|1.0|I just don't have any patience for a story that is supposed to be about historical characters but plays fast and loose with facts.  After I watched the second episode, some parts of the story didn't seem right; when I looked up the information I found that quite a bit of the story was just made up!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Very well designed game glad I got it and have fun saving animals  old and new kid friendly and a good way to waste time in a waiting room :p
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I listen to them daily during the week have enjoyed the ride.  Aria is my favorite character. and the second is Lady Margorie
B008HLZUUE|5.0|Though not as fast-paced as its predecessor (A Storm of Swords), this novel offers new perspectives and a new shift from familiar characters in previous ASOIAF books. As long as you don't expect a quick continuation from the ending of book 3, you should be more than satisfied. :]
B005DJREJS|5.0|Being a 66 year old, never would have thought I would like this show. Certainly these teens are a lot more sexually free than they  were when I was a teen.  Still the show is entertaining and the Amazon Prime is a great deal, have watched all of the episodes of Dowton Abby, Doc Martin and now the Awkward show are my guilty pleasure.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|As most, I enjoyed Hitchcock's creative mind and found that this quality glimps into a fantacy of his life and character was every bit as entertaining.
0545265355|5.0|I borrowed the first one from my sister and couldn't put it down. Its well written and captivating. I knew I needed a set for myself otherwise I'd never give my sisters back lol.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it would be funner if u could buy a horse without using real $$$$ and it would be cool if u could breed them
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Checked out this DVD at my Library and could not finish watching it. Singing was bad and I wasn't impressed with the performances either.  Didn't think Anne Hathaway was impressive, even with the hair cut.  There are almost 10% 1 star ratings, so I don't think 1 star is out of the question.  Maybe the cast wasn't well suited for the musical format.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I used this app on my original Fire and found it fast easy access to facebook.  So.... purchased for my new Fire HD and find that it is convenient and a timesaver on those occasions when I want to clear the FB backlog.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's one of the best games I've played. Am addicted to it. Can't get enough of it. I would definitely recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Captured me from the first paragraph. King at his best. Totally captivating. I highly recommend this book to all of Stephen King 's fans.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|With all the hoopla around this book, I had high expectations. It was just a quick, easy ready that didnt blow my mind.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This show deserves more. It was a victim of Fox cancelling quality television and keeping garbage. American Idol being the first piece of garbage that comes to mind.<br /><br />Spoilers below.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a second movie, even though main characters were killed off in the first movie. Hopefully someday this series will make a comeback.
B002WN35DC|1.0|The little prince without drawings is incomplete. Bad Bad presentation of the little prince. Nobody should buy this book. Is worthless
B008YU0AOE|4.0|. It did more than I expected a free app to do so, I bought it. It could use a larger selection of skins .
B002M2T1UO|5.0|No Spoilers Here:<br /><br />Maybe my favorite series ever. FX does an excellent job of making quality shows that make you actually interested throughout without following the same script every episode (as in it doesn't feel like a slightly altered episode each time).<br /><br />Seriously, if you want a gritty cop drama, get in on this. No it's not HD or Blu-Ray 1080 p but guess what? This dropped in 2002 so keep that in mind (TV wasn't this raw from what I recall then).<br />You will not disappointed (well maybe a few of the later seasons are meh but if you look at most the best shows (the Wire, SOA, Sopranos, etc there's inevitably a few bad eggs)
143353083X|5.0|The ESV Study Bible has proved valuable in many ways, including context of the actual writings as well as interpretations of language.  I use if often in daily meditation where what I read has a biblical reference.  I love having this in my collections of treasures.  Thank you very much.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|This is truly a unique album, and unbelievably the most Volbeat has grown over the years.<br /><br />If you have not listened to this, do yourself a favor. Story telling at it's finest!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game!  Intriguing background story and beautiful graphics.  Hours of entertainment appropriate for All ages.  Could not put it Down.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|What a fantastic spin on the Sherlock and Watson in present day times, Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Lu play of of each other with brilliant wit and charm!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read it pretty quickly and was entranced!  I love the style but the content was sad, be forewarned.  I'd read more of his work for sure.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I am glad I bought this. I have all of Nicholas Sparks works. This just added to my big collection.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I found it reassuring , someone said what I was already thinking. Why can't I have a career I love and also be a good  Mom?  Also I respect a woman who decides to stay home after having children. It's all about choices. My favorite part of the book \\"What would I do if I wasn't afraid ?\\" WOW, that's a game changer type of question...I LOVE  IT...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Just wish I didn't have to wait so long on the updates for my kindle. :)
1451668945|5.0|Book arrived way before was promised.  I am currently reading it. So far, it's great, as one would expect from Mary Higgins Clark. If you enjoy her books, you need to read this one.
B00AJLHULW|3.0|If you're a Robben Ford you love it.  But I wish he would get back with the Blue line.  Rosco and Vinnie add a stratosphere That has not been seen in a while.  Not to Self.  I must get the band Back.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|First off, i have been waiting 10 long years for Jesse to make his return, don't get me wrong.....Howard is ok, but i always felt the first 2 albums OWNED and this one picks up where those left off. The 3 albums with Howard just got boring, they seemed to be in a rut and not only that but all the heavy songs lacked ANY melody to make them palletable....then theres the songs they just went almost scrEMO (starting over/take me away). SO this may have been the shot of Adrenaline they need. Plus Jesse can sing live where as Howard has issues replicating his vocals live (listen to the live version of Holy Diver from delux issue KSE album or his cover of Jesse's My Last Serenade from delux issue End of Heartache). So now im pumped to see them live!
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|Aside from being in fight/flight mode which stresses the Adrenal Glands, this show is wonderful.  It is INTENSE and you never know what is going to happen next.  The cast members play their parts perfectly.  I love each character - they all bring something interesting to the plate.  Sometimes I wonder - what are they thinking - don't go by yourself!!!  It is a great form of entertainment as long as I don't watch it too close to bedtime or I'm too cortisol-ed up to sleep.  I can't wait for the 4th season to start and for the third season to be available to download so I can watch them again!!!  This is a great show for teens and over!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this every day! So addicting. I love it so much I would do anything to play it in my head during the day!
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Definitely staying in rotation in the car, just wished there were more songs on the album.  I know, I know, teh songs are liek 7 minutes long each but still feel it needs more than 10 songs.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Once I learned to use it I found it a valuable took in star observation. I was amazed at the number oof satellites up there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game great!!  I really enjoy Temple Run but this game serves up a lot more fun.  Best free game I have downloaded!!  GET IT!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you love bingo. Then you will love this game. I play it on my kindle fire and my Pc. I play it almost every day.
1616890835|5.0|This book is great !! When I started making signs in 1985 , everything was still hand painted, so the painter &#34; Freddy &#34; in our shop had to teach me this stuff, reading this book was like taking a trip back in time. From Billboards to paper signs and show cards, Its all here just like Freddy showed me.<br />Its a Shade not a drop shadow .. the old timer would say, ,Also there is a great extra at the end of the book, the appendix is the best part. but you will have to buy it to find out what it is.....<br />Price is right and delivery was quick!!Thanks Faythe and Sam!!!!!!!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|This is a good app to use along with Weather Bug and a few other weather apps.  I keep track of performance three weather apps to determine which one gives results closest to the actual weather in my area.  This app rates the dhighest for my needs.
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book in hardcover when it first was published and I ordered the Kindle version recently.<br />Still a great read!!<br />I highly recommend it for those who have not read it, or seen the movie.<br />Dan Brown grips your attention from the first page and it then becomes a reading compulsion to finish the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun & addicting game!  Play it all the time. Fun for the whole family. Just like the carnival
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|A cheap and shallow version of a great series<br />If I had read this one first, I would never had read<br />The great other books about Pendergast<br />Shame on them for even trying to make money on this
B003DTMUOE|4.0|Me atrapo la historia y me hizo seguir leyendo hasta que se termine. Interesante postura para pensar y sacar conclusiones.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|This series reminds me of the Brit version of &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34;.  It's set at the end of the 19th century in a rural agriculture area.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Love Love LOVE this movie SO much! Julia Roberts and all of the other cast members are great! Its happy but sad at the same time!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is the best show ever!! It's scary and captivating. I only wish the family from season one were in it...
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Great music is just that, great music. Justin has outdone himself with this LP. Its a stylish 70's throwback. From the long playing songs to the impecable musicians and vocals. I'm hard to impress and this album is splmply awesome.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I'll tell you, I've always loved the melodies produced from the vocoder Daft Punk uses. Pharrell and his falsetto, goes great with Niles Rodgers guitar riffs. Definitely looking forward to the album release.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Great movie even for multiple viewing. A great addition to movie collections. Watched the free VOD that came with movie easily on my iPad
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched season 1 and 2 for free on the prime account. Got so hooked I actually paid to see the 3rd season. I never got into on TV until the 3rd season was almost over. Cant wait for the next season to start
B00AZM7IQC|3.0|I really enjoyed this video. Unbelievable performance. I am a very big supporter of 3d. This video has great 3d except is has a very large amount of distracting crosstalk, especially in the dark scenes. Worse than I have seen in most 3d,
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Don't know anything about motorcycles or motorcycle gangs but this show is awesome!  I can't wait to watch the next episode.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I think I will try the game and see if its as bad as everyone says it is. once I played on a friend's ipod and I thought it was fun but I only did the normal version.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I haven't laughed that much during a movie in quite a long time. They make such a good comedic duo. :)
B00979CS50|5.0|Fantastic...Zuma...Like a Hurricane...Rust.. Ragged Glory...and now the Pill.  Love the Horse!  Love this CD...  Ramada Inn...Need I say more.<br /><br />Love It!  Long live the Horse.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Been playing MTG since it first came out. Over the years they have made play way too complicated in MTG. Love the fact that a simple card game like this punches MTG in the face and made it to the Tablet market first. Great job Gameloft.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was not fond of the book.  I found it to be a younger persons novel and not too much happening thereout the story.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved the whole series ,but the last especially. The way it started putting the pieces together and at the same time removing the characters and contenders for the throne made it hard to put down. I can' t wait for the next book.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown is usually a good read.  This one doesn't disappoint.  Lots of symbolism and conspiracy make for a convoluted plot.
B00845PT18|3.0|it drags on. its is boring.. there is not much to say but i do like cage in this moive..  the 1st one is much better.. i wish i could get my money back or make it a free prime movie..
B003JTHXOK|4.0|For the romantics.  I love Nicholas spark books but I find them all the same.  It was very light reading and good for an escape.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Too dark, literally and very &#34;heady&#34;.  Not my favorite,  Must understand politics to follow.  I don't a d watching was too much work.
6304366078|4.0|Received three Acadamy Awards.  Tells the stories of four Formula 1 racers: a world weary veteran who is unhappily married, a dashing rookie, Pete Aaron in his prime (James Garner) and Scott who is married but his wife wants him to get out of racing.<br /><br />The story begins in Monaco, on car cameras, beautiful camera shots (sometimes we see all four of the main racers in one shot). Plenty of advertising.  Pete and Scott get tangled up in a wreck, Scott is badly hurt and Pete loses his ride.  Pete goes to Ferrari for a car and is declined so he has to be a reporter. Meanwhile the veteran aspires for a gal and Pete hooks up with Scott's wife, seems girl chasin' is like racin'.<br /><br />A car owner from Japan decides to enter a 3rd car and asks Pete if he wants to drive. With the drivers wearing helemets it is not always easy to tell who is who, like a football movie. The engine sounds are good.<br /><br />Scott heals enough to race but has to take meds which leaves him drowsy. Their season is followed and the announcer explains the situations.<br /><br />A heartbreaking conclusion.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie was as good as it is because of the book. And it was as bad as it was because they changed so much of the personal aspect; the movie spent 10 minutes on one hunt at the beginning and the setting, changed how Katnis gets the pin, and most importantly, the relationship with Peeta wasn't given its due for the upcoming storylines.<br /> It's appealing because of the books and I am sure people will continue to rent and watch it, but hopefully they've read the books and know how good the actual story is.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This novel was not what I expected.  I read it but a points found it alittle boring and draggged on.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. While I can understand why this was not originally released, had some issues with the recording, I am more that satisfied. Would recommend to all Marley fans.
B0082SU98U|5.0|If you want to see the world from a different perspective read this book. So much of our joy in life comes from how we decided to view our circumstances. Let this story show you a new way to getting the most out of your life.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's fun and has cute little dragons, but it likes to go link dead on me. Play it when I can anyway because I do like it.
B0095P33IW|2.0|This movie takes way too long to get to the action.  I didn't want to see so much background story. I wanted to see Captain America, it is the title of the movie.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Being a father of 5 children under the age of 6 (2 of which were just born 2 weeks ago), I found a lot in this book to think about when it comes to raising my children. Changing my mindset to observing an instructing has already paid dividends with the way I interact with my children. Bringing Up Bebe offers explains a number of the differences between french parenting and typical middle-class american parenting. While I don't feel my wife and I have been as extreme as Pamela portraits American parents to be with some things, I do see a lot of value in doing things a little closer to the French parenting style. &#34;The Pause&#34; is one thing that has really helped a lot. It is important to remember the purpose of &#34;The Pause&#34;. Don't simply wait to tend to your child to teach them patience or because you are busy with something else, use it to observe your child and learn how they are dealing with their environment and current situation. Doing this has helped a lot with dealing with the tantrums my 2 year old twins throw from time to time. They don't last nearly as long and they dont' happen nearly as often. When using &#34;The Pause&#34; with my newborn twins, I have been able to observe them solving their own problems. Where some parents might immediately intervene when a newborn cries out, going to them and just observing them a bit has shown me that they are fully capable of adjusting their bodies to a more comfortable position, or chaining into the next sleep cycle.<br /><br />I highly recommend Bringing Up Bebe for both new parents and old.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|An enjoyable continuation, not quite as good as the first but still a fun read to while away a relaxing afternoon
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the app and it can be fun but if you had to pay for it I wouldn't recommend buying the game
B008Q00I9O|1.0|This was so not funny I didn't laugh not once. Maybe I need to see the other version. I kept waiting for it to get better.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I got this book for only $1 on a sale, and I like it. It is a pretty good book so far!
B003GK22HK|5.0|For some strange  reason I  thought  that this was going to be another war time  novel.it was no - only  a  small portion was set during WWI .If  you  like  intrigue,famility loyalty, filial jealously,  deception  and forbidden love  The House  at Riverton.  has it all. Through the timeworn technique of flashbacks  the author  author  has managed to hold your interest throughout. What a ending!- somewhat surprising but definitely  understandable
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game could sale at 4.99$, but they don't need money, so people can still this game with zero cent
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|:) omg it was teh bestest bhook evaz. I lovesd its so muchh. It hadz lots of death and stuff but dat. Kay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Overall, this is a solid casual game. It doesn't force you to use real money to enjoy all its features.
B000FBFML6|5.0|Great read and I highly reccommend all of Robin's books that I have read thus far.  Each trilogy is as good as the last.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am hooked on this series! I love it so much it makes you fall in love with some characters and hate others as well. The creators did so well with the zombies in this series that it has you believing this is how it could be in the end. You are constantly on the edge of your seat ready for the next thing to happen and to see from one episode to the next who will live and who will die. You laugh with them and you cry with them. My favorite series by far!
1476712042|2.0|I do not understand how this book received such accolades.  The only reason the book received two stars from me was because it was well written.  The content was horrible.  The heroine liked to play one man off of the other and could not understand why they both became angry.  The hero was a violent, controlling, abusive character.  What kind of message are we sending our young adults, when this behavior is applauded?  I just do not understand.
1583334386|5.0|I have two copies and can't part with either of them - both are well worn as I use them for reference constantly.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Fast shipping. Good shipping packaging, no damages. If there were 10 stars I would have rated a TEN! Hugh Jackman<br />was truly AWESOME! The rest of the cast was top class, even Russell Crowe (who I don't like) did a truly wonderful job.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|my daughter always talked about this series and i was always reluctant to sit and watch. didn't think that i would like a zombie movie but was i wrong! she has the first two seasons but i couldn't wait for her to purchase the third one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game<br />I love u subway surfers like it's really good game it really is a really good game

Her voice is just as good, if not better than when she first started out!!!!!! She is &#34; TRULY THE DIVA&#34;.<br />NO OTHER SINGER, DANCER, ACTRESS, SONG WRITER, PRODUCER HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THE THINGS &#34;THE DIVA&#34; HAS DONE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS!!!!! 65 and growing stronger and Younger! She deserves the rest although all her millions of fans would Love for her to return to touring! &#34;THE DIVA&#34; &#34;FOREVER&#34; Take that all you funny witches!

0151003084|5.0|I can't help but chuckle when someone picks up this book and starts to read. You will usually hear...&#34;Oh My!&#34;.  Ha.
1476734941|4.0|Informative...reassurance that YOU can do it.  The Doctor says how you might feel while doing the fasting.  Making what you feel a natural  happenings while fasting.  Suggestions on what to eat.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I have all the Collectors Extended versions of all the hobbits and this is very good but so far it is not as good as the earlier movies. I don't want to give it away BUT, I will say I was totally caught off guard by the ending that isn't the end. Will there be another HOBBIT in December 2013? YOU GUESS!!!!!!!!!
B0031RS69G|4.0|I enjoyed the book as i could lose myself as i was reading it and imagine that i am one them
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Recommended by a friend sometime ago...just got around to reading. Really enjoy the combination of fantasy characters, science, and time travel. Looking forward to the 2nd book of the trilogy!

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My entire family loves this show from age 12-50. It's always surprising, suspenseful and very funny. Gotta love that Dean character!
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|The wound the mother had on back leg appeared to be impossible to even walk, not to mention a instant loss of blood & pressure.<br />It is a predictable Lassie movie.

B004X2M9VY|5.0|Like how you are captivated in noticing seemly small, insignificant parts that mean so much more down the road.  Great stories, I've been fooled many times on the doom of the Dr. only to see the bigger picture put in place earier.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I remember the hype for this record being huge. Early reviews were largely favorable and it seemed everyone was standing at attention, eager to get their hands on it. I certainly couldn't blame them for their enthusiasm. Parachutes was a great debut and A Rush of Blood to the Head was a perfect follow-up, marking Coldplay as one of the best up-and-coming artists of the decade. I wasn't bouncing up and down with anticipation but I was definitely curious to hear this new album and wanted to know if it could live up to the praise and massive hype. My first impression was a mixed one: half of the record was fantastic and the other half was dull and far too safe.<br /><br />For starters, I have to say I love the artwork. The cover is simple yet striking, grabbing your attention and instantly catching your eye. Using a graphical representation of the Baudot code was brilliant and definitely a highlight. The artwork certainly gets a thumbs-up from me but ultimately the music is what counts and that's where my true judgement begins. The album's first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", didn't thrill me. It sounded too similar to \\"Clocks\\" from their previous album and never really built up to anything thrilling. Over time I've warmed up to it a bit; it's serviceable but not a destined classic.<br /><br />The first half of the record, the \\"X\\" side, is the album's strongest part. \\"Square One\\" makes for a solid and engaging opening track. It sounds dark and atmospheric, giving you the initial impression that Coldplay is going for something grander and far more daring this time around. That may be true to some extent and it runs through the first side of X&Y. It's an energetic start and there's a part of me that wishes the entire album were built around this sound and edgier atmosphere. Fortunately, there are a few other songs that fit in with it. \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Fix You\\", and the Kraftwerk sampling of \\"Talk\\" are all fantastic and surge forward with relentless energy. Coldplay have often been accused of being safe and soft, something that I won't deny has been the case to some degree. However, tracks like these have a more daring quality to them that makes me realize the band is capable of more than they let on.<br /><br />While the first six or seven tracks are pretty enjoyable, it's the second half of the record that really holds it back. The \\"X\\" side feels darker, heavier, and more ambitious than the \\"Y\\" half. While \\"Speed of Sound\\" gives it a decent start, it flounders fairly quickly. \\"A Message\\" is standard Coldplay: gentle, heartfelt, and a bit melodic. The following tracks, such as \\"Low\\", \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", and \\"The Hardest Part\\" have the same problem: they're just not memorable. In fact, the hidden track \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" is actually one of the album's highlights, a track written for Johnny Cash but was sadly never able to be recorded by him before his death. The album is strong out of the gate and falters by the halfway mark. It seems like the band was set on doing something different and more daring, only to rely on their trademark sound and some boring arrangements by the time it's over. In the course of the last seven years these songs don't sound any different to me. None of them are inherently bad by any means; they're merely average and feel like b-sides from A Rush of Blood to the Head instead of something truly groundbreaking. It's like the band got cold feet and second guessed themselves into treading ground that had been worn thin by this point.<br /><br />Another weak point for the record comes in the form of Chris Martin's lyrics. Now let's be honest: words have never been his strong suit. I commend him for being honest and writing about topics that everyone can relate to. It's clear that his words resonate with listeners and I certainly count myself among them, yet that doesn't mean I don't want him to get better and branch out from the usual cliches and nursery rhymes that have a tendency to plague his work. On this record they're embarrassingly predictable, almost as if they belong on a Hallmark card. It really holds the record back and if the music had been stronger then they would have been easier to overlook. Just listen to \\"Twisted Logic\\" and the album's title track to get a better idea of what I'm talking about. I do have to give props to \\"What If\\", which is lyrically and musically simple but manages to overcome those shortcomings with some nifty production touches.<br /><br />X&Y isn't a terrible album. It has its share of great songs and even the weak tunes are tolerable in small doses. The real tragedy is that I don't feel any different about this album now than I did in 2005. It had the potential to be huge and daring, yet it fell back on tired arrangements and predictable songwriting that should have been left behind. It's mediocre and it could have been so much more. Seven years later I still enjoy listening to it from time to time and it does bring back some fond memories from the summer of 2005. With the passage of time some records change and go up or down in my rankings. This one is one of those rarer cases where my initial feelings were correct. It's decent and in the end I suppose that's better than nothing. From here the band did step up their game and they continue to push themselves with each new recording. It's just too bad they didn't have the foresight to follow through on this record with that same enthusiasm.ecord they're embarrassingly predictable, almost as if they belong on a Hallmark card.

We first guessed one another's strengths, then had a great reveal retreat.<br /><br />At the retreat, all our strengths were revealed and it was terrific.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|When it comes to making big sounds, few indie bands do it better than Canada's Arcade Fire. They've been critical darlings ever since their debut album, Funeral, was released back in 2004. They managed to overcome the odds and won Album of the Year for The Suburbs, something that I never thought a band of their status would win in an industry smothered with shallow pop and repetitive rappers. While their following has continued to grow, it seems their second record, Neon Bible, tends to get slighted and dismissed quite easily, a trend which I don't understand. Granted, any band would have been hard-pressed to follow up Funeral, but Arcade Fire managed to do something different and that's what I love about this album. It's my favorite of theirs and certainly one that rewards those willing to give it repeated listens. It's a dense and darker record than what came before or after but that's just makes it all the more compelling.<br /><br />The album wastes no time in setting up its dark atmosphere. \\"Black Mirror\\" slowly fades in and finds frontman Win Butler begging, \\"Mirror mirror on the wall/Show me where them bombs will fall\\", setting the stage for the doubt and numerous questions that propagate the album. Much of the record was recorded in an old church, giving the sound a deep, gothic texture that immediately sucks you in without overwhelming you. It's a delicate balance and the band manages to keep it consistent and intriguing. One thing that's immediately apparent is the heavy use of organ on this release. It gives many of the tunes a looming and operatic soundscape, a far cry from the more playful and upbeat sound of Funeral.<br /><br />\\"Keep the Car Running\\" was the first single I heard from the album and it didn't take long to grow on me. Its chugging rhythm and Butler's soaring vocals make it an unforgettable experience. The title track  is little more than a gentle whisper, with subtle instrumentation and a running time of only 2:17, yet it's one of my favorite cuts here. It's haunting and mesmerizing, begging to be dissected and examined through repeated listens. \\"Intervention\\" begins with a swell of organ that instantly makes you take notice, as well as containing some of my favorite lyrics on the album: \\"Been working for the church while your life falls apart/Singing Hallelujah with the fear in your heart/Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home/Hear the solider groan, 'We'll go at it alone'.\\"<br /><br />\\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\" is a bold piece of music, beginning with an upbeat melody sung by Regine Chassagne and Sarah Neufeld before quickly taking a more sinister turn when Butler sings the second half. Arcade Fire has always had the advantage of having a couple female members and their contributions make all the difference, adding small vocal and instrumental touches that elevate the songs to exciting new heights. \\"Ocean of Noise\\" concludes with Latin-sounding horns that work marvelously and are completely unexpected for such a subdued and contemplative song. \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\" is the most impressive song lyrically, with Win spinning a chilling tale of a father wanting to use his daughter in order to gain fame for himself. It's a somewhat twisted and chilling story made accessible by a catchy melody and great rhythm work. \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\" is another favorite, complimented by a driving rhythm and pensive lyrics.The main standout is the fantastic \\"No Cars Go\\", a bustling anthem that concludes with a chorus of voices and instrumentation that leave you with chills. It's like a great roller coaster: it makes you want to hop back on as soon as you get off.<br /><br />I'm not sure why some fans are so dismissive of Neon Bible. It's a brave and ambitious record that seeks to do something different and doesn't find the band resting on the laurels of their debut. It's a far darker and more intense affair, yet it's also hopeful and inspiring. The sound is much more layered andI'm sure some have found it to be very off-putting. Maybe that's why I like it; there's so much going on and you want to pick each piece apart and hear all the different instruments and production touches that are generously sprinkled throughout all eleven songs. It paints a portrait of a band hungry to move to the next step and push themselves. The results are nothing less than astounding. Crack open Neon Bible and see what you find.I'm sure some have found it to be very off-putting.

B0013LPS6Q|5.0|In 1976 Larry Mullen, Jr. posted a flyer in the hallway of his school. It asked if anyone was interested in forming a band. Over 36 years later they're still going strong and have cemented their place as one of the most influential and beloved bands in the world. It's always interesting to see where artists come from and how their beginnings shape what paths they take down the road. U2's 1980 debut album is an energetic and accomplished burst of post-punk that gives a big hint about just how high the band would claim in the years afterward.<br /><br />You can't ask for a better opening track to a debut album than \\"I Will Follow\\". Everyone's heard this track and it still remains a fan-favorite and a staple at their shows. A tale of yearning and confusion written by Bono about the death of his mother at an early age, it combines everything that makes U2 such a powerhouse: Bono's soaring and passionate vocals, The Edge's chiming guitar, Adam's urgent bass-lines, and Larry's powerhouse drumming. For a young band it's extremely impressive.<br /><br />While it's certainly an amazing song, it's not the only standout. \\"Twilight\\" is an overlooked gem, complete with the classic line, \\"Boy meets man in the shadow\\". The theme of growing up and moving from childhood into adulthood is obviously a central theme to this record. For a young band on the verge of becoming adults, it's a mature and introspective look into boys leaving their youth behind and taking on the responsibilities of men. \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" and \\"Stories for Boys\\" both deal with similar themes, including trying to find love and escaping into the world of fiction and stories in order to lose yourself.<br /><br />\\"Out of Control\\" is my favorite track. Written by Bono on his 18th birthday, it's a ball of energy that never fails to pump you up. The same goes for \\"The Electric Co.\\", which explodes right out of the gate with some extraordinary guitar work that only The Edge can pull off. \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\" closes the album in haunting style, while \\"The Ocean\\" is a more subdued track that gives a bit of a respite from the high-energy stylings of the rest of the album.<br /><br />There are some neat surprises to be found here as well. \\"A Day Without Me\\" finds Bono writing from the viewpoint of someone considering suicide and wondering whether the world will be any different without them. It's a heavy theme but he manages to find a balance and optimism in the midst of the darkness, a U2 trademark that continues to the president day. Perhaps the most intricate tracks are \\"An Cat Dubh\\" (Irish for \\"the black cat\\") and \\"Into the Heart\\", two tracks that essentially form a six and a half minute medley. What's really striking about these songs is the break in the middle, which is quiet, patient, and impressively well-formed for such a young group. It's this small glimpse that gives us a look at the genius and talent we could expect from the band over the course of their career. Hearing it is quite a revelation.<br /><br />Boy is an exciting and sophisticated introduction. It's relentless energy and passionate delivery immediately makes an impression that's undeniable. From here the band's sound would develop further and they'd grow into those men that Bono sings about so often on this record. I discovered this album when I was teenager and I found great relief in listening to these songs; I could relate to Bono's words as I struggled to become a man myself. That's not to say that this record is just for the young. The music transcends age and grows with you as you go through life, another U2 hallmark.<br /><br />The boys have become men, yet they've never forgotten that youthful spark that started it all.ees\\" closes the album in haunting style, while \\"The Ocean\\" is a more subdued track that gives a bit of a respite from the high-energy stylings of the rest of the album.<br /><br />There are some neat surprises to be found here as well. \\"A Day Without Me\\" finds Bono writing from the viewpoint of someone considering suicide and wondering whether the world will be any different without them.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|When my friend first showen me subway surfers I liked it I downloaded it and I was happy its a great game
B001DHXT20|5.0|Loved this film! It blew me away with its excitement, drama and of course, action. People may think of this as mainly an action film and compared to Ang Lee's version, there is a lot more action but it is far more than that. The action is brilliant but it's also the relationships between characters, the chase element of the movie, the good dialogue and the great acting, that make this a great movie. Personally, I thought this was better than the Ang Lee version although I don't mind that version either.<br /><br />It's a fairly fast paced action thriller balanced just right with enough slower paced scenes. Hulk as the protaganist taking on the US army, including a bad ass/superpowered Tim Roth and then the supervillian Abomination at the end, is all very cool. The whole build up of the movie where he's hiding out in Brazil, living in the favelas and working in a local factory is great.<br /><br />Liv Tyler makes a great Betty Ross, the love interest. In fact all the characters are handled very well by the actors and Ed Norton is by far the best Bruce Banner I've seen. Shame he wasn't in the Avengers film.<br /><br />Definitely check it out!, especially if you're a superhero film fan and goes without saying if you're a Hulk fan. For me, this takes the top spot for superhero films and rests just above other good superhero movies such as Superman Returns, the dark night, X-men first class, X-men 2, Iron Man, Thor and Sam Rami's Spiderman trilogy.

The quality of the movie is not HD. It is very poor and lousy.

1476733953|5.0|Because it is that good.<br /><br />Sci fi has many genres, from cyberpunk to space opera to mil sf.<br /><br />Some of it is very, very good.  Some is at best tolerable, even to sf readers.  Much of it is a guilty pleasure, good for the in-crowd, but hardly something a mainstream reader, unacquainted with SF, would be too impressed with.  Too geared towards technology, action or, sometimes, an inventive but obscure idea.  Not enough towards character development or big ideas.  When there are political messages they are often stereotyped:  evil corporations, corrupt politicians, heroic rebels.<br /><br />Wool manages to pull off a brilliant take on repression, information control, elitism and good old-fashioned Big Brotherhood.  It does so without resorting to high tech blabber, zombies, lasers or many other SF tropes.  Wool cares, deeply, about characters and it is about them, first and foremost.  It is not a book you'd need feel ashamed to pass on to someone who doesn't usually read SF.<br /><br />Had it come 50 or 60 years ago, Wool might have been considered as part of the greats like 1984 or Brave New World.  I don't think it will, though the mass of reviews and appreciation by the readers may yet prove me wrong.  Not because it lacks in power, but because there have been some many novels about dystopian societies since that its message is by force somewhat diluted and not as original as it would have been then.<br /><br />My one minor peeve is that Wool seems to be expanding into a series.  I've always preferred self-contained novels.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|We watch this every Christmas Eve.  It's genius!  Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchit is hysterical.  All the muppets are top notch.  Michael Cain's not too bad, either.
0553386794|2.0|I haven't been able to finish this book ever. As soon as I learned that the current count of books would be increasing, I abandoned this series.<br /><br />Martin's technical writing skill isn't bad at all. This is how he keeps you engaged for most of the book until you realize that the plot moves at less then a snail's pace; imagine the inverse of a Star Wars hyperspace jump. That's what reading this book is like.<br /><br />I also found the characters to be really dull and almost all of them are stereotypical elites (I know it's a book about lords and ladies, but come on). There were only really two characters I enjoyed reading about, John Snow and Tyrion Lannister. Ned Stark was alright, but only a little better than the other characters.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers didn't enjoy the book because of the sexuality. I would like to address this as well. I don't mind sexuality in books as long as it has something to do with the plot. With this book's maddeningly slow pacing, it's almost as if the author puts a lot sex into the book to hold the reader's attention. That's where I get off with the amount of sex in this book. It really doesn't surprise me that HBO picked this series up for TV. They do the same thing with most of their TV shows (maybe except for the Pacific and Band of Brothers).<br /><br />In conclusion, this book (and series) is good for if you have a lot of time and nothing else to read. I would not recommend this book for even the biggest fantasy reader. I think I'll read LoTR a hundred times before I read AGoT even once.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I saw the movie first so it was neat reading the book and putting faces to the characters in the book.  The movie and the book were pretty close although there were some changes made in the movie.  But I enjoyed reading the book even though I knew the story.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Others here have praised the quality of the music, and with them I agree. As a fan of soundtracks, I am continually amazed and pleased to no ends at Mr. Zimmer's ability to fashion scores of such soul-inspiring impact. I would impress upon you the absolute necessity to purchase the whole album rather than individual compositions, as track eleven, &#34;Psychological Recovery&#34; which is an &#34;Album Only&#34; exclusive is a masterful piece of work. I would also like to point out that I bought the CD along with the &#34;AutoRip&#34; feature. It is quite remarkable in this day and age to have both the physical and digital versions of the track. Well done, Amazon. The CD itself was delivered with the customary Amazon speed and precision. One neat feature of the CD booklet: look for a photo of Mr. Zimmer with Sherlock's hat on! Thanks to Mr. Zimmer and all the fine musicians for this wonderful soundtrack!

B005LCYR7Y|2.0|I am a fan of Stephen King, although I am disappointed how few of his novels translate to the screen, but this book was just too long.  Sure it covered 5 years in 'real time' but the story dragged and I couldn't stay focused.

B0094K1WZE|3.0|The movie was not bad... It wasn't outstanding though.  The plot was a bit weak but it had plenty of action.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm not a big fan of English novels or history, couldn't care less about the aristocracy and its hierarchy, but on the recommendation of a few friends I decided to give Downton Abbey a try..........all I can say is I've had to sit down and marathon watch Season 1 and Season 2.  It's a wonderful program, richly detailed not only in its visual aspects but the characters as well.  I won't go into plot and story here as there are plenty of spoiler alerts out there.  Maggie Smith is superb as the matriarch of the family dishing out very subtle one-liners that will have you laughing unexpectedly.<br /><br />I knew it was a winner when my sports-watching, Speed Channel husband stopped by while I was watching an episode, wrinkled his nose briefly, sat down for a &#34;minute&#34;, and 3 episodes later said &#34;hey, this is pretty good&#34;.
B008602KQI|2.0|Trite.  Couldn't end soon enough.  Trip and roll down a hill.  Please !  Over dramatized.  Even running across the grass was dramatized.  Dog beast materialize out of forest floor leaves is turning technology into magic.  Where is Dr. Strange.  Cave love & devotion was time filler and badly shot.  Photographic quality was middling at best.  Three rabid dog beasts become five.  Arrogant evil super competitor gets thrown to the dogs and lets wait 10 beats before we kill him.<br />Huge production, lots of money, but did they forget how to make a movie?  They knew how to raise lots of money and  market.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I know this trilogy was meant for teens and preteens but I love them. They are well written. Good characters that you care about. As soon as I finish this review I am going to start the third and final boom. I have its as good as the first two.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really good I recommend you to get it lots of fun to play and if ur a horse person u need to get the game :)
B004NELBPC|1.0|I very rarely write reviews - but I feel the need to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the new Huffington Post app format. It is completely unusable. Navigation is broken and the font is too small to read. This used to be one of my favorite apps - now it's garbage.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is awesome! I play it every day. You can design your own restraunt its sooooooooo cool. There is no doubt you should get this game!!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Explores more into the alternate universe.  Olivia is trapped on the other side while fake Olivia takes the real one's place!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|lately on my kindle fire it has been saying its low on internal space so I deleted everything except the apps. when I found this I went into the aneroid file then deleted the file called com.amazon. venizon ( or something like that) it cleared up a ton of space
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Flipboard has a great look but  it's pretty unusable since articles won't load or take forever to load on my fire hd.  I will way for the upgrade where you can make your own mags and see if it fixes but if not it will get a delete off my kindle. If it works well I will fix my rating.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun an easy to play keeps me busy an helps kill time when in waiting to get in to an appointments
B009I2UH2W|4.0|You gotta jam this thing in your lighter thing, but it works fine after that. I'd recommend it to you!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Riveting psychological thriller but plot deadens. A little over halfway through I found myself asking why go on and on? I was over it. Last half could be condensed.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|I downloaded and installed app, but it crashed before ever opening. I uninstalled, redownloaded, then reinstalled, but MapsWithMe never opened at all, but crashes at opening.
B0087ITBT8|3.0|\\"Let me tell you something kiddo, you don't have to like me or spend time with me, but as long as I'm your mother you will treat me with respect. Now drink your water before you drop dead from dehydration.\\" Andy Brewster (Rogen) has invented a new cleaner. He is going on a cross-country trip to try and sell it. His first stop is New York...and a visit with his mom (Streisand). When a conversation brings up old stories Andy decides to invite his mom to join him, which he regrets about 5 minutes in. I was looking forward to seeing this because the trailer reminded me of me and my own mom. I will say the movie wasn't as funny as I was hoping but it was still really funny and I do recommend this. Every mother and son should see this together, I saw a lot of similarities between me and mine throughout. Some lines I'm sure we have said over and over. The cast is perfect and Rogen and Streisand actually seem related. The end got a little sappy but overall this is a very funny movie. Overall, funny but I was also hoping for funnier. I do recommend seeing this though. I give it a B.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I was surprised at how easy and invigorating it was to learn about the history of physics and the origins of the universe. Krauss has an enthusiasm that is infectious and permeates this entire book. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the universe. And that should be everybody.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I rarely play games online or on my computer.  Just bought a Kindle and played the free version of Angry Birds and I am hooked.  Love the sound effects.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This book has a great story line and the characters have very interesting personalities. Some of the language is a little hard  to understand.
0439023491|5.0|Let me first start by saying, AMAZE BALLS! Oh I loved this book I was dying to read it for sometime, with the movie coming in November I figured 2013 was my chance to complete the series! So if you have not read Catching Fire read it now, so worth it.<br /><br />What I loved, of course Peeta my love muffin, the fact that Katniss is lucky enough to score a love like this she should be counting her lucky stars. Peeta has a new found love of painting which I love because I too am a painter. As Katniss and Peeta get ready to take off on the victory tour all things are going great. Of course Katniss's life has changed along with everyone else in District 12, Gale included. I love the new relationships that have formed and that Peeta and Katniss help the people of District 12 like Gale's family. I also love the fashion in this book, OH Cinna make me a dress, I want the fashions, to some they seem so different but that just adds to the awesome factor. OK OK I don't want any bird claws or weird fish eyes, that I draw the line.<br /><br />I love the developing love between Katniss and Peeta, I think that Katniss needs to let go of Gale and move on to someone she cares about so much. The love triangle is driving me mad already. I love the uprising going on and that Katniss is so blind to her power. That just shows her age. Also I am kind of tired of the bratyness (if that is a word) that Katniss shows throughout the book. Again Suzanne Collins writes so beautifully the pages fly by and with each one I am in tears, laughter or uproar! Thank you Suzanne.<br /><br />What I didn't like Pres. Snow just his name makes me make a face that is disgust. Adding to it why does he smell of blood? YUCK Surprise without the spoiler, what Katniss does in front of the GameKeepers priceless!!! Read and you will agree.<br /><br />Catching Fire will keep you reading, wanting and loving this world. My favorite district you may ask GO 13 what there is no 13? we shall see then..........<br /><br />BUY IT, READ IT and then in November WATCH IT....... So Amaze BallsBUY IT, READ IT and then in November WATCH IT....... So Amaze Balls
B00947N6D8|5.0|We watched this movie at the theater...Then I and my daughter loves it so much.<br />Now we can watch it anytime. we watch it again and again...<br />This is one of the best movie for us!
0385537670|5.0|The language in the book is very simple but it is highly entertaining. It certainly brought the erotica genre into the field. Definitely a must read despite it not having any underlying philosophy or anything. Might even be interesting to read for the psychology side of it, but even then, there's not much of that either. The main character is a literature student but hardly ever makes references to literature in the book. The main one I noticed was more historical when she says, &#34;Et tu, Brute?&#34;<br /><br />Still loved it and I gave my girlfriend the paperback trilogy before the hardcover one came out then I bought the hardcover one for myself.
B007N85POS|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game it's ridiculous. Rio has some really tough levels, still working on a few of them. Just got a new update recently - the Rio Marketplace. Highly recommended.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|My wife loves it - good renditions of the Motown catalog.  Easy to listen to - that's all I've got.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|The first three days it worked quite good then it just stopped and can't show any station any more. What a disappointment.
B007712XAU|5.0|Our daughter recommended this show so I bought the first two seasons to watch.  This show is better that I had expected.  The acting & writing are really good.  It's fun to imagine life in the early 1900's and the cast portrays life in that era very well.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|i am a late comer to the bones movies. i read most of the books so it was hard to make myself watch them. i'm so glad i have i enjoy them very much
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It would have been perfect if it could bring a fairly clear picture at low visibility.<br />But I like it. Thumbs up!
B005DJREJS|4.0|Very funny and full of sardonic wit.  But not really believable..... is a 15 year old girl really getting all that action and not being caught?
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved the cast, the music and everything about the movie. I'm sure I'll watch it again and again .
B0094K1MH2|5.0|That's perfect. I mean perfect in everything. The quality, the motion picture, the sound, the buffering. It is a delight to me and my kids.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game makes you feel like you're a hair stylist. The possibilities are endless!!<br />I totally recommend this game for people who like to be creative (or anyone)!!!!!!!!!
B00APYUPB0|5.0|I own every CD in their catalog and this group does not know the meaning of \\"throwaway\\" or even \\"mediocre.\\" Every song they have ever composed is exceptionally high quality. Their epic songs are not only grandiose and entirely riveting, but also take the listener's emotions on a magnificent journey. It is impossible to hear songs like The Enemy Smacks, Awake and Nervous, and The Last Human Gateway without getting goosebumps -- particularly the end portions. This new release contains a wealth of material. I can't even do it justice. Here is a link to a professional prog review of it:<br /><br />[...]
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I haven't had time to discover all of it, but for the few games that I played, I have no problem.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I did not expect much from this book since it was cheap but I actually enjoyed it.  I thought the book was predictable but it turned out I was wrong.  Love when a book does that to me.
B00402FGE4|5.0|Everything was as expected, packaging, disks.  It waswell worth the money spent.  Good price for a great product.  Would consider further purchases.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I read this book a few years ago, but apparently a different edition or under a different title.  I had no problem recognizing it from the brief description given, though, since it really stuck with me.  It is a wonderful story with quite a few twists and turns and I loved it.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Another great product and again, worth the expense.  Disks were packaged in original cases,  Would purchase more products in the future
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Outstanding and beautifully written, this presents the subject of indentured servants from Ireland, a subject I was not aware of, and the delicate but fascinating thinking on both sides of the slave situation in early southern living.  For a new writer, it shows tremendous effort to research the subject and write a meaningful rendition of life in the south, early 1800's.  One cannot wait for a sequel.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved and enjoyed this book and will return to the characters in my mind often. I realize it would have made for a very long book but and that the author was trying to be true to the voice of the characters but some areas of the story really did require more information and better transition. Most importantly, I felt like Lavinia could not possibly have been that dumb or naieve after growing up the way she did nor (mini spoiler) would she have held the papers for as long as she did. There were plenty of people she saw each day that could have gotten them to Belle. (finished) So this did not ring true to me.<br /><br />I have to say that in spite of some of my frustrations with the story, I have been thinking about it every day since finishing and that says so much.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Captivating. Couldn't put them down. They kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! Highly recommended reads.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Who thinks this hard about screwing up a relationship?!  Focus your energies on something positive!  Plant a garden or volunteer!  Sheesh!
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Very nice album.  Her voice is so versatile and she sounds super on fast, slow, playful or profound songs.  She is my favorite female singer
B008XG1X18|5.0|THis is a well organized app and just as good as the regular Pinterest website.  Another app I can't live without!
B003DZX44I|5.0|Thank  you for sending this to me last year. I do apologize for the delay, was so excited when I received it. The movie is perfect. Would highly recommend and order again from you. The quality of the discs are PERFECT!!!!<br />Thank you again!!!
B0086700CM|3.0|My coordination is not good with this game.  It frustrated me so I deleted it from my Amazon account.  I like the idea of the game but it just wasn't for me..
B004BLDD9Y|3.0|I have been on a mission to find an LED bulb I really like.  These are very white, NOT blueish.  They have an ok spread but still hard concentrated out the top of the bulb area.  So far the yellow colored phillips bulbs have taken the crown as best overall.  But these are the brightest ones by far.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I thought this game was very boring and moved too slowly for my taste.  No excitement at all. I removed it from my apps because I know I will never play it again.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great selection of stations and super<br />easy to download and use!!  No matter<br />what kind of station you like, you will<br />find it here.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This doesn't always want to load.  I may just try to remove it from my Kindle and download it again.
B005CRQ3RK|1.0|First I ordered the book and all went fine until I tried to deliver to Kindle Touch and it turned out to be incompatible. Then I read a little a bit online, just to find out that the book contains foul language, no swear words, but overall words I would rather keep out of the house and out of the mouth and mind of my children. Then the content sounds entertaining on first read, but after reading carefully the first few pages, the style was poor at best and anything communicated was the same as watching an episode of \\"Beavis and Butthead\\". Nothing bad, just limited learning value, to be used only for entertainment and then for warped minds. In civilized countries such content will be censored, at least for minors.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am on Facebook alot on my lapstop so when I got my Kindle Fire, the Facebook app is the first I looked for.  It is a great app. Just disappointed I can't play my Facebook games with it.
B0000013GT|5.0|OutKast was first Southern rap act I really got into. This Georgian rap group's second studio album &quot;ATLiens&quot; has a sci-fi and non-traditional summertime feel to it in my own opinion. The beats are five-star worthy. 'You May Die (Intro)' is a great introduction, nothing could be more appropriate to the feel of the album. While 'Wheelz of Steel' is likely the best track on the album to me, but all tracks are five star songs so everyone has they're own favorites. ATLiens by OutKast is not to be missed because it is excellent and a top album. 9/5 out of 10/0
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|In comparing this with Extreme Road Trip 2, it isn't quite as fun, but those of you who have more control over your game playing skills will probably love it!  I had a hard time controlling the buggy and couldn't keep in on the road, but I guess if you play it enough it would become easier.  This game is great for all ages...even us seniors!
1573225517|3.0|So, I think I'm starting to understand what my problem is with Nick Hornby, and the reason why he's otherwise loved. His stories are written from a male perspective, at least the one's I've read so far, and so it makes sense that they are written the way they are (i.e. crass, clumsy, lacks a lot of tact, more realistic I guess, unromantic, and filled with so much self-loathing and that of others).<br /><br />Personally, this is my second book for Hornby - the first being About a Boy, which I really disliked. I didn't hate this one, but I didn't like it very much either. The characters are simply not likeable. And I truly hate infidelity, adultery, liars and cheats. I mean, come on. The protagonist, whom I cannot even recall his name, is an overgrown, immature boy. Yes, he has good taste in music, but that's about it.<br /><br />I won't lie, there are some parts which you relate to in terms of being in a relationship, but this is mostly written from a guy's perspective. Nick is basically taking you on a very brutally honest journey into a man's mind - and that's how it works. Reality check indeed.<br /><br />The story felt very silly, incomplete, and altogether unnecessary. I don't even know how to describe it to tell you the truth. There was a beginning, a middle, and then it sort of trails off into nothingness. I have to believe that not all men function the way the character in this story does.<br /><br />I suppose the bottom line is, Nick Hornby writes the opposite of chick-lits. Not sure what they call that. Male-lit? So I can understand why a lot of men would enjoy these books and relate to them, I guess. Even some women maybe. Personally, It's not for me. This one and About a Boy were more than enough Hornby for me.<br /><br />I did very much enjoy his short story Nipplejesus, so at least there's that. Maybe I like him better in short stories than I do when he writes full-blown books.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|This DVD takes us back to the '88 Seventh Son times. I really like and appreciate how Steve Harris directed this remake for the fan's view. It was nice to take a trip back in time and watch this performance. The second disc has the documentaries and promo videos. I always like to see the behind the scenes stuff and all the stories as told by the guys in the band. Fun times! Another good DVD to add to the collection. Up the Irons!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|My kids adore this app, from the 13 year old down to the 5 year old. They can't get enough of smacking Tom in the face and listening to him repeat all of their silly nonsense. It's great entertainment on a rainy day. Be prepared for lots of laughter! Especially if you get two devices going at the same time and Tom starts to repeat them in stereo. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there isn't that much to do in the free version. I think they could have been just a little more generous, and it asks if I want to update every single time it opens.
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|What can I say...other than this is Iron Maiden doing what they do best and in front of 50,000 fans! I just love to see them feed off the energy from the excited fans there in Chile. I really liked the setlist on this one. A good mix of the Final Frontier songs and the classics. Just another great Iron Maiden DVD. These guys seem to get better with age.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|This is a detective story worth your time.  And one of a great series. It indeed pulls you into the page turning mode.<br />Great characters. Great history. Great novel.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|If you love the ABB you must add this to your collection...good quality recording, and the band was at their peak
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Paramore is a band that I have been following since they made their mark on the music world around 2007-2008 and I have been eagerly anticipating the 4th self-titled album. I knew that there was a lot of change coming especially since this band has gone from a quintet to a three man band. Basically, this is not like the past three albums and where this band is going is still a bit of a mystery. There are a lot of different sounds represented in this album. From new wave, pop and indi (featured in the interludes) Haley Williams has definitely come a long way. Her high volume blasts have turned into very mellow and soulful ones and she has become quite dynamic by setting all the different tones for each song. No two songs are quite the same in this record and that makes each one a good listen. I would have to say my favorite song on this album would probably be 'Daydreaming' like most songs I enjoy this one just has one of those hookey choruses that I love.<br /><br />Like all the bands I enjoy listening to, I always enjoy something fresh and new. Still, it always leaves me wondering what will be coming down in the line the future. So far based on what Paramore gave me this time around, I am ready to see what I will get.
B004RFWZNY|4.0|Given the poor quality of the video I could not rate the thing 5 stars...but the performance, and Dickey Betts' playing in particular, is on FIRE and well worth the money to any ABB fan...I've seen the band probably 30 times and this was Dickey Betts just absolutely playing his as* off. Awesome.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Throughout your childhood you are told of incredible persons that bring hope and joy. Well, what if I told you they were real, and they were like a super-hero team defending the children of the world? 'Rise of the Guardians' is an amazing story featuring a stellar voice cast, incredible animation and something for everyone.<br /><br />I was not surprised that some of the events that take place are a little non child friendly. Guierrmo Del-Toro, has a way of turning the tamest of fantasy, into a action packed epic and still a ton of heart. This is a movie that children and adults will love and I really hope there are more to follow. Hopefully new guardians as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The dysfunctional and loving relationship just kept pulling me in. Loved it all the way through.
B007REV4T8|3.0|My &#34;boys&#34; like it.  I didn't.  Too much explosion.  It's no as good as the older version of 007 who shown as more of a gentleman.  The new ones are all emphasized on &#34;killing&#34; rather than the story.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|This is a pretty well done movie. Children and adults will both enjoy it. Even if you are not, or never were, a gamer (which I am not).
630529142X|3.0|This was recommended by a relative and told us that our whole family would enjoy it.  It didn't meet our expectation.  It was kind of &#34;stupid&#34;.  I did like the message that it tried to bring out.  A more clever touch would do better.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Love it!<br />I had this when I was growing up and now my kids love it too.  It works great!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is well written as far as keeping your attention. Heart breaking for the wrong doing to children. Joyous for a light at the end of a long suffering tunnel.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara your voice makes my day more calm.  I just love to get all stompin' mad then turn this on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surgeries the best game ever! Me and my sister's boyfriend always have competitions! He once got a millions as his score and I can't beat it!<br />I don't no way game I'd play without subway surfers! It is epic!I can't find a bad thing about it! Lol xxx

1400031524|5.0|We have found a new detective that keeps us riveted by his humanness and unorthodox style of work. Mankell has us captured in all of his Wallander series. Next to Vargas... he is our top writer in the genre.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I have to admit that I play it a lot....maybe too much.  It has captured my interest so I'll sit down often just to play it.  Fun!

B009G8GRX6|4.0|The latest Muse album still pays heavy homage to Queen, but does so in a unique way where previous albums fell flat. &#34;Madness&#34; is particularly addictive and on my short list for one of the best indie singles of the year.

B008F5YDRI|5.0|The story is a very interesting concept and as an Anglophile, I love the scenery while the film is in the United Kingdom. A good story about defying the odds.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm having lots of fun playing this game. I haven't got far yet but it looks like something that I will enjoy
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I started using feedly when Google announced it would shut down Reader. I like the format for reading on Feedly and I'm looking forward to updates that wool enable me to add subscriptions without going through Google Reader
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Horrible acting. It just seemed so forced. Like a cheesy comic book, it hits all the cliche's in tiresome fashion. Super-gratuitous violence that tries ever so hard to make up for predictable/lousy plot that is riddled with continuity errors. At least the first Dredd movie had some life to it. This one is just an exercise in CGI capabilities and nothing more. Just because you can make it, it doesn't mean you should.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|I saw Pandorum on TV.  It was really a great picture so I bought it to add to my own collection.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|It seems to fit well & will no doubt come in handy. I will know more once I start to use my new Kindle.
B0060D2WYI|5.0|I bought this for my Grandson.  He really loved to watch it.  That was one of his favoriates to watch after preschool.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Wonderful movie in the true style of all Cohen Brothers productions.  The acting and dialogue were superb in this movie.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Really enjoyed it.  First saw it on TV. Liked it so much thought I would add it to my collection.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|worth watching watched all four seasons if you got the time and need something to do watch this show very entertaining
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great book.  Lots of twists and turns and kept you guessing all the way.  I highly recommend
B00C2VIA52|5.0|The graphics and cards made this game really cool because it's also strategy. However I want the game to have more effect like fire or ice damage so getting magic resistant matters to. All I saying is that making the game a little more complicated like that game sorcery quest on Internet might get everybody who loves fantasy or strategy games might reach them.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Words cannot express how much I love this movie! Only critique: they seem to have miscast javert. Anne Hathaway is a great singer!
B005C8ENI0|5.0|This was an excellent book AND a Wonderful movie from Amazon.  It is not expensive to rent a movie from Amazon and watch it on your TV.  i would like for all of you to give yourselves the opportunity to read the book or listen to the audio book and also, watch the movie afterwards. All 3 opportunities will be a gift for you and your family.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Linda T

B004NELBPC|1.0|I used to put up with the Kindle version of Huffington Post but now I am removing it from my Kindle.  The new version has type the size of a grain of salt and I've tried to increase it to no avail.  Also, I don't have as many choices in my reading content since the developers went to a more pictorial presentation which is pretty but pretty useless.  I guess I will have to \\"HuffPo\\" on my computer.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I have been a fan of all things Steven Wilson -- from I.E.M. to No-Man to Blackfield to Porcupine Tree -- with Porcupine Tree being my runaway favorite.  Ironically, of all the Wilson projects available for consumption -- I have liked his solo work the least.  So, I mourned his decision to put Porcupine Tree on hiatus and focus solely on solo material and prayed that he would come to his senses.<br /><br />If this album represents where Steven Wilson is going as a solo artist, I no longer am afraid for the future of his music.  This is one of those albums where almost every listener will have different favorite song, and that favorite probably will change the more one listens to the album.  Each song is unique and good in its own right.  The musicians all are extraordinary.  The sound quality is even better than that.  I already have purchased tickets for his Los Angeles show, and am counting the days.<br /><br />Others already have dissected each song, and duly noted all the prog influences that have influenced this album.  I won't repeat all that.  All I have to say is &#34;buy it, and invest time to actively listen to it.  You won't regret it.&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A fabulously creative story of a brave new world after the world as we know it crumbles. In the old tradition of science fiction, and I enjoyed it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Ok, how can you not like a Viking Om Nom? How about a Egyptian pharaoh? Pirate? Yep, that's what you get! Feed the cute little green guy AND one of his ancestors. New ways to play, new toys to use. Get the game, you won't regret it.
B0002WZTOI|1.0|DVD cover did not match as advertised, or I thought it would be from pictures on Amazon website, or the photo at the top of this review form. But, biggest disappointment was with sound quality; could not get speakers, bass setting to bring out the subtle low edge gradual increase of music, to eventually hammer one with the intensity of the soundtrack that I remember from the movie theater and previous viewings on videotape. The whole soundtrack, verbal and musical, felt like an afterthought. Waste of money. Would give this a big zero rating if possible.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Having seen the trailers for the movie, I decided I would want the book first - not trusting Hollywood to tell the story.  I found it a facinating read.  Descriptions were detailed and imagination empowering.  Besides, I am an animal lover.
B000WN60NG|3.0|It's a really bad story and some pretty mediocre acting.  But, much of the music is outstanding and that's the reason I watched it this time.  I had a vague memory of this movie when it first came out but couldn't remember much about it.  It's worth your time if you like great guitar playing and some blues music, but pass it by if you're looking for a great story.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Did not realize that this was a series book when I ordered it.  I will now NEED to read the next one, as I really enjoyed the story line, the characters and the promise of more to come.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|PERFECT !<br />The best in entertainment video's.<br />Il Divo has talent, the best voices!<br />Obviously, proffessional well trained classical voices.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary is convenient wherever, I don't need internet connection to access, Its also a very helpful book for English learners. I love it.  But recently I have been getting some error that the words am looking for are not indexed.
B00AO7HQ06|3.0|The music is great, no question about that as is the organization of the music.  However for that price the other materials shouid equal the quality of the music and it just does not.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|When I updated this app crime Rome to Sydney it deleted ALL my data the only thing kept was my double coins powerup. So now my 300000 coins went to wast I spent about $20 on my coins now they are Gone what is wrong with that??!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Nicely ties up the stories of the 3rd age. Was a little overwhelming name wise at first. But the memories came back eventually
B003O86FMW|5.0|AMAZING<br />I LOVE this book so much it was a great book but I think it needed more action in it great!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|How did that happen? I know that if get this book you be saying what I have. Get the book you will just HAVE to buy the next book.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Excellent book. Well written, very descriptive. This book will make u laugh and cry, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading an amazing book, you won't be disappointed. As always the book is much better than the movie
B00CFEJGO0|5.0|I love the books and the movies; Hannibal is one of my all time favorite characters. I didn't get my hopes up too much, but three episodes in and they keep nailing it, spot on. I love their casting choices, the actors are of the highest quality and execute the polished details of their roles with perfect restraint. The stories within each episode are tight and still add to the flow of the overall narrative.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Play this game it is awesome it is better that temple run. It is always changes.and great characters.PLAY THIS GAME!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Well done version on one of the old classics. Works perfectly on a fire hd. The graphics are chunky, but that is how it looked...
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Good looking. Must have. Liked it a lot. Simple way to manage my daily goods and tasks relatively easily and fluently
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love this series and was extremely happy to receive this dvd and watch it!<br />Thank you for it's availability!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is a little addictive. If I didn't run out of lives occasionally, I might not put it down. I haven't seen the other problems reported, so I think they've been fixed.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Insider's look at the old South Civil War era.  Well written from two distinct points of view.  Hard to put this one down.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Great scifi mixed with western thems. Strong characters you know right off the bat. Excellent plots include details you don't normally see in scifi, such as the mix of Chinese and american spoken language.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|where rock and roll had gotten off to. Now I know, and now it's back. King Animal is one of the few really great rock albums of the past 10 years.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|An astonishing piece of work. Masterful in terms of articulation and description. His characters are so vivid and real...and the linkage thesis draws you to the next page. At times, the sublime diction and mataphors becomes a burden. Worth the read.
1463514581|5.0|This book seemed a bit out of my typical reading, but on the recommendation of a friend I picked it up......and could not put it down! I love how the author makes you feel you are Rose, experiencing her life with her. It is rich in context and content. I found myself teary eyed at times, but yet also laughing out loud. Her innocent romance scenes made my tummy flip as they captured those moments perfectly. If you are hesitant about this book ---- do not hesitate any longer. Despite missing a lot of sleep to finish it, I am not feeling tired, but rather was left feeling energetic and inspired! Excellent read!
B00AGKHFCA|3.0|Sadly, the orchestra is so loud it overshadows the voice. Enjoyable but not as much as some of his previous ones.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Very quick read but the story really makes you question what life was like for children back then!!! Main character is a little too naive to believe though.
B004NELBPC|2.0|I don't know what happened, but the layout changed and I hate it. Only a couple headlines fit on the page at a time now. I just hate it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that is awsome because u get to do all what u want to do love it really do awesome thanks for this game it is really cool
B008D28HYS|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game!!  It is a great logic puzzle game and good for the brain!! I can't wait for more!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed it from beginning to end. As usual, he did a masterful job of arranging the events. Reminds me of The Firm, The Client,  The Pelican Brief and Runaway Jury which I believe are his best novels.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|There are natural bonds between a mother and son. Likewise there are natural barriers that should not be crossed as adults, things that are better off not said. In this film Joyce (Barbra Streisand) and her son (Seth Rogen) break those barriers in this humorous and heart warming tale of a mother and son's road trip, one where they both do things out of love for the other one, that might make them ill at ease.<br /><br />The film has great chemistry and dialouge. There were a few moments when the doting mom thing became too cliche, but it didn't last. Worth a view, worth owning.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Mom and son go into a strip club, with pole dancers, but there is no nudity.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Just a nice, smooth, laid back session with two of the greats. Wish it was longer.<br /><br />Good listening anytime. Enjoy
B007SGM084|5.0|I would greatly recommend these books for bedtime reading.<br />I have enjoyed reading with great intense and looking forward for more!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app provides all measurements of expected, and current, weather.  Hourly forecasts, too.  Beats meteorologists because the info for wherever is on-demand.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would great recommend these books for a great weekend reading.<br />I enjoyed reading these books and hunger for more!
B00138EY28|4.0|This is all in Latino language as I knew it would be.  Very easy to listen to, but not my favorite of her albums.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This novel read like a film on the big screen. I literally cried at one point (and I swear I'm not the crying type....except if its kittens or babies.....or dolphins). Andy Weir has outdone himself. It is sit on the edge of your seat, can't wait to turn the page suspense with a healthy dose of humor. I loved the characters, the attention to detail, and most of all the fact that it's a story You dont expect to enjoy......think Tom Hanks stuck on an island but 100 times better.<br /><br />Seriously.....can someone write a screenplay?
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|We love this movie. I would say it is an all time favorite family movie. It has a great deal of comedy and teaches moral for kids.
B008Y73940|4.0|The movie was enjoyable and had a great pace.  The characters seemed well developed and the twists were hidden well.  The movie was worth my time to watch.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This version has New levels that don't disappoint game play. Its consistently good and  will keep you wanting to  collect all angry birds games.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|Great Buy! Would recommend anyone to buy it ! If your tired of the same stuff on the radio it is a nice change to make!
B005USZYDU|4.0|Grisham has brought the legal milieu within reach of all ages with this book.  It's an easy reading, fast moving story with a loveable protagonist.  A rewarding read.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Good game so far. Like it as much as the first two I played. Very addictive for adults and kids.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I knew once I downloaded this game it would be my #1 pass time and it is. love this game!!!!!
B005ES0ZKS|4.0|Crocs are ugly but they are comfy. I wear these around the house and are great for that. For me these are not for out in public use. They are just too fugly.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The movie was a great price especially for a blue ray.  I've only watched it once since I purchased it.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm is a great book. I can't imagine the discipline, training, and dedication that it takes. Certainly appreciate their service.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Great fun to play, but the game loses my lives if I leave with some &quot;hearts&quot; remaining. I'm playing on a Kindle Fire.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Deleted my account shortly after downloading it. Not as easy to use on my Kindle, and difficult to explore the features.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Action always draws you in, as did this.  Shooter has the story line that would make you believe that this has happened.
B00B7FWWNA|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, both actors are magnificent. The want would be that they would live happily ever after, but alas it isn't the Hallmark Channel. Enjoyed it however.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was pretty good, kept me wanting to keep reading and reading and reading. It could have used  a little more detail, though. Also, clarification. This may be because I'm young, maybe because it wasn't there, but I was confused at quite a few parts. Still, great book, nice conclusion. Four stars.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Needed an alarm while on a business trip, this was easy to use, and easily visible at night. Used the alarm several times.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I wanted to take my gaming experience one step up, so I decided to buy Anker's High Precision Laser Gaming mouse. I received it two days before it was supposed to arrive and upon opening it, I was a bit disappointed as my mouse did not come with weights. However, this problem was remedied as the mouse can hold up to three quarters. The quarters fit quite well and you won't notice them unless if you shake the mouse really hard. In addition, if I ever need 75 cents, I know I'll have it in an easily accessible spot.<br /><br />Other than that, I have no problems with the mouse. It's highly customizable and it looks and feels great.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Acting was good, movie was okay. I would have preferred to have more than one set for the whole movie, as it made the movie implausible.
0345535421|4.0|This book is interesting, detailing events as a number of people seek positions of power, or have power thrust upon them in the chaos following the king's death.  The writing is very adept, as each chapter continues to unfold from both a large perspective, and a point of view of the character that is specifically being focused on.  Also, there is a deepening sense of coldness as the world itself is coming to winter.  The world of the book is a violent clash of tactics and strategies, and of brutal action, as the power game unfolds, where some role is played by the weird undercurrent of magic in the book.  It is a world full of struggle and strangely destitute of hope.  On the other hand, the vision of this world, albeit bleak, does hold fascination.  A few of the characters, too, like Arya and Tyrion, seem to be rather appealing.  There is even a sense that Tyrion, for all of the intrigue and horror that dogs his life, is a rather decent and intelligent person, caught in a mad, violent world.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I really like this series.  It has well developed plots with lots of twists and turn.  Not predictable, which I like.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great series and I enjoyed watching it on Amazon when I was unable to be at home.  This is a must see TV series.  Een if you don't like zombies, you will enjoy the story of human survival and circumstances.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is fast passed fun read. You root for the characters from the minute you start reading.  Most of the time it was hard to put the book down, because you just want to know what happens next. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B0009IW9CK|5.0|This review is not only of this particular CD, but of the entire John Mellencamp \\"Definitive Remasters\\" catalog. As a lifelong Mellencamp fan, I have purchased every one of John's U.S. offerings. His body of works speaks for itself, so I will not try to convince anyone of its superior quality. Simply put, if you are either a Mellencamp fan or a fan of good quality recordings--perhaps both--these recordings are a must. The quality of the remasters, when compared to the originals, is obvious and exciting. I have now replaced all of my originals with remasters, and can only say that if you want an incredible listening experience, do the same thing. Oh, by the way, \\"Big Daddy\\" finishes my upgrading, and it might represent the best improvement of the bunch.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|This book was hard to get into.  Sometimes it is confusing about which character the story is about because it jumps from character to character and you have to keep up. There is just too much written about politics and one characters view of how the world has to be. The parts about family dinamics and what's going on in their lives are actually really interesting. I would not recommend this book to friends.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was a fun game. I liked the different puzzles and the option to play dominoes instead of the HO was nice. Not a game for awhile under 12 due to the jump out and go boo parts.  It was really kind of short.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its like temple run...but waaaay funner you can revive yourself just like temple run and u don't even have to pay to revive u can collect keys in your run. And the characters are more detailed and cooler. And its more easy to get game money and buy chatecters and boards. Plus what a creative idea... subway surfing...lil and its freeeeee
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I like the Cinderella story of Rodriquez's life as it relates to the CD. I feel that the music and content of the language unify to bring you into a total experience of what the song is communicating. The quality of his voice is captivating.
B004R5Z30Q|5.0|True, the graphics aren't as good as Ang Lee's, but that's up to you really. This is just a great story time and time again. Read it first in 6th grade and probably read it once every 2 years or so.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|The plots are too shallow.  Something more appropriate for a ten or twelve year old child. Not anything I'd recommend for an adult to read.
0684803356|5.0|If for no other reason, this looks impressive as s*** on a bookshelf to any chick who values good literature. However, if you're not an empty husk of a human being, this is a phenomenal story about love and war that illuminates human emotion and connection so thoroughly, you'll hate that your own life doesn't carry as much meaning. I only gave it five stars because there were no more to give.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Its awsome! full with action and musical events! Not worth the 2 dollars i had to pay to see it but worth my time!
0743529030|5.0|The Magic Of Thinking Big is a great book, but the CD set is dramatized and very entertaining. I've already listened to it 3 times. A great addition to our positive thoughts library.
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|The first time I played, I made it to week 18 then it exited and I could not continue. I reset my KFHD and downloaded again; same outcome. Third time downloaded tried changing names of player and only got past the first purchase and to San Francisco to sell, but no go. I'm sad! What a cute game!!!! Just loved looking at the beautiful masterpieces. G5 please fix? And, yes, it all went sideways right AFTER I upgraded for 1.99.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|The dance scenes are the only great part of the movie the rest is terrible. Not worth even buying it
B000S1L7IU|5.0|A typical Clive Cussler book. Gets you interested early and never stops being interesting. Excellent job of weaving all the parts together.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|The stage version is always my favorite, but this cast has many good singers.  The weakest are Helena and Sascha, and Amanda and Russell.  I think they did a respectable job in the move version and I was not disappointed.  There is no way it could be like the stage version.  I am thrilled they chose many performers who appeared in Les Miserables in concert and stage, and in other stage roles, rather than strictly a Hollywood cast.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Do not miss this opportunity to understand the horrors of a front line combat soldier so eloquently told by one who lived it. A must read for anyone interested in the day to day life of those who defended our freedom against the forces of tyranny.
B005DZMODI|5.0|The blues live on, continuing creatively here in Marsalis, Clapton, and each band member.  An energizing, elegant, funny ensemble.  Like Joe Turner, the blues have been and have gone--and yet remain and grow in brilliant new forms.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|one of the best books i have read recetly. it starts slow but it worth sticking with. read it before seeing the film.
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins once again kept me captivated with his fast paced action and fascinating scientific and historical knowledge. Never a dull moment and always information to be gained from reading one of Mr Rollins' novels!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Game froze up. cant get into at all. Also. when could play. NO DINOSAUR. RESCUE.  on the kindle on the New HD kindle. either.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I got the free version just to try it out and was hooked in a short period of time! The game was entertaining and the story line was really good.
1609611543|5.0|I think more and more caring doctors are finding this out because they are willing to open their minds and care about people. Makes you wonder whenn most doctors keep telling their patients eat more wheat, all the while thet get sicker. Great read
B004AQR29C|3.0|Lame plot- lots of action, with lots of action stars. Bruce Willis is seen for 2 minutes tops. Cameo?<br /><br />While I appreciate action, the amount of action here was like a dose of high level sensory overload.<br /><br />Too much happening way too fast.<br /><br /> Faster than you can focus on.<br /><br /> And then, after a while,  you become totally desensitized to all the action and violence.<br /><br />You feel nothing- you lose any sense of suspense or dread.  You are just watching gunfire- explosions- hand to hand combat and waiting for it to be over.<br /><br />The movie breaks down into like a 3 or 4 act play- it is that simple plot wise and how it moves the story along is literally in that many steps.<br /><br /> I like a lot of the action stars in this movie but the movie itself was lame.  There is just no other way to put it.<br /><br />And of course, like any James Bond movie- so much was unbelievable.<br /><br />(No one should have survived the first scene of explosives and gunfire-but of course, miraculously they do. I have learned to deal with the disbelief because all action movies tend to be like this.)<br /><br />  I trashed this movie as a waste of time mainly because of a lack of plot.I am surprised they came out with an Expendables 2.<br /><br />Action is great in a movie especially when the plot is just as exciting.  That just was not the case here.
0385344333|3.0|I have read most of the Reacher books and it is a great series, with Reacher being one of the best characters in fiction.  This one gets off to a great start, and I enjoy the way Child builds the suspense with the short chapters.  However, once a key plot point is reached, namely, the identity of the woman in the car with Reacher, the book goes south.  To me, there was not enough motivation for Reacher to act as he did in the book's climactic chapters.  It just didn't make sense and seemed to be inconsistent with the motivations of the Reacher character from other books.  A slight miss here for the author.  But I still look forward to the next installment in the series.  Not many better books that I've ever read then Persuader.  That by itself spurned brand loyalty with this reader.
B003V5K0AQ|3.0|Okay- I admit I spent  $1.99 to watch this, because I love Bull Terriers. I went in knowing it was a quick *movie*( approx 30 mins, if that).<br /><br />This is the movie version of what is now being promoted as  the  animated  FRANKENWEENIE movie at 90 min.<br /><br />I guess Tim Burton liked his first efforts enough to do an animated story, but he made the new one a lot longer.<br /><br />(How he added more into the latest story to bring it to an extra hour longer, I can't answer.)<br /><br />I have NOT seen the latest animated version but it seemed to get good reviews.<br /><br />So should you see this?<br /><br />Well, you won't miss anything if you don't see it.<br /><br />And if you do see it, you will have an idea of what is in the animated version.<br /><br />This was over in the blink of an eye, and in all fairness, I am unsure if it qualifies as anything other than a movie short.<br /><br />As I said, I mainly rented it because I love Bull Terriers.<br /><br />While Sparky the dog is the main subject in this film, I didn't get to see enough of this cute dog in action.<br /><br />Take the plot of Frankenstein and make the dog Sparky the much maligned Frankenstein, and you get the idea of what happens once his owner resurrects Sparky from the dead.<br /><br />Sparky was once well liked by people before his demise.<br /><br /> But when Sparky is brought back to life, it does not take long for the  neighbors to freak once they see him out and about, his body loaded with cuts and gashes held together with giant exaggerated stitches.<br /><br /> The very noticeable giant bolts on the side of his neck just add to poor Sparky's freakishness.<br /><br />(The movie actually has a depressing element to it.)<br /><br />If out of curiosity you want to spend 2 bucks and see Burton's original try at this storyline, go ahead.<br /><br />It might just prompt you to see the new version of FRANKENWEENIE or maybe even consider adopting a Bull Terrier.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I love my Snugg, this is exactly what I was looking for.  Now I can put my phone in my purse without any worry that it will get scratch or damaged.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Got quite a few laughs out of this one- even if some were cheesy laughs.<br /><br />Those who can relate to the humor in here, are going to be people who are close in age to the characters. as they will get many of the culture references of their past.<br /><br />But still, anyone over 18 can get a kick out of this couple becoming a bit unraveled at the prospect of the big 40 creeping up on them.<br /><br />The Unrated version is not that much longer but sometimes even a little extra time on a movie adds to scenes that were worth keeping in the film but for some reason were cut.<br /><br />The movie is earthy- if you are prudish don't rent it.<br /><br /> I think Paul Rudd did a great job with his part.  To me it seemed like all the actors played their roles well but Rudd seems to be the center of the movie.<br /><br />Most of the humor happens in the first half of the movie, but you will stick with it out of curiosity to see how it all ends.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Can't believe it was free...just as good as many others I've had to pay for. A good, traditional Harlequin. If  you like them, read it!
B002BBJ52U|3.0|After all the hype that was behind the book- this movie was a let down.<br /><br />Right as the movie begins we are introduced to lots of characters ( with very well known Hollywood names).<br /><br />Get the scorecard- but only if you think you are going to care about keeping track of these couples, or people trying to couple.<br /><br />After you meet them all, you then get to learn about their relationship problems.<br /><br />Problems that we should care about, but don't.<br /><br /> Well, for me that  was a bad sign right off the bat.<br /><br />I don't have any interest in these characters or their issues.<br /><br /> Why am I watching this again?  Is this movie going to get any better?<br /><br /> Yawn- ho- hum.....Who has the chips bag? Pass me the soda will ya?<br /><br />Oh, yeah back to this movie.<br /><br />If you think this is going to be as humorous as the book or audio recording of the book- forget it.<br /><br />In the mood for a rom-com?<br /><br />This is not it.<br /><br /> It's not funny and with the exception of one couple in the plot, it is not romantic either.<br /><br />It is also a chick flick.  CHICK FLICK. NOTHING IN IT FOR THE MEN. NOTHING- ZERO- ZIPPO- NADA.<br /><br />EXCEPT FOR CATCHING A FEW ZZZZZZSSSSS BECAUSE THEY ARE BOUND TO FALL ASLEEP IF YOU PUT THIS ON.<br /><br /> Guys don't dig most chick flicks- but a really bad chick flick, is up there with other forms of male torture.<br /><br />So there you  have it- not funny,romantic, interesting and definitely not worth your time or money.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|Wolfram Alpha is an amazing piece of software for anyone with curiosity, especially of the mathematical variety.<br /><br />This app is the same as Wolfram Alpha on the web (as far as I know), but it comes with a nice custom keyboard for inputting various mathematical symbols in.<br /><br />Support the makers of this wonderful software - buy the app!
B008602KQI|4.0|Entertaining movie - it makes you think about how our human nature can be very perverse and evil and at the same time loving and good.
B0018RFLN0|3.0|Mission Impossible is an OLD movie.<br /><br />And not old, like a fine cheese or wine that matures with age. More of the bad old, the undesirable old, the kind of old that you're forbidden from referencing when anyone the age of your grandparents is present.<br /><br />I really wanted to end this review on a positive note, perhaps by highlighting some redeeming quality, but I honestly can't think of one. I regret ever watching the movie. Sorry to the five or so remaining fans of Tom Cruise (actually - who I am kidding - he was still hilarious in Tropic Thunder. Let that be a lesson to children everywhere: even if you're crazy, you can still be successful).<br /><br />TL;DR: This movie's age shines like a blowtorch under a magnifying glass.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I could not put this book down.  With tricks and plot turns that have the most synical of readers gasping with shock.  Totally gripping.  This had me hugging my husband and thanking God we are so normal!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The walking Dead writers will take the story anywhere.  So don't get attached to anyone from the previous season.  Anyone and everyone is up for grabs when it comes to getting bitten, or worse.  If season 3 promises anything it is that season 4 will be the best season yet.  The finale could have been a little bigger, but that is said without knowing what is to come in season 4.  The momentum grows in this season and looks to be the beginning of something huge in the next season.  Best of all are the characters.  All of the actors do a great job in this series.  If you enjoy Breaking Bad and you don't mind zombies this is will be just as enjoyable.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A lovely innocent read.  Beautifully describing real people who have suffered from life, like all of us.  I couldn't help but google the map to see where Harold was at.  Just lovely.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I liked being able to watch it immediately.<br />I didn't have any problems with this product.  I would like to be able to watch it more than once in 48 hours.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What a hoot.  A brilliant descriptive book celebrating all the personality types.  Highly recommended.  A great holiday read and yay - no violence!
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is really fun to occupy the time. It is so easy my two year old nephew can play it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was able to put all my lenses and camera body into it. What a great buy! It fits under the seat of an airplane and makes it easy to carry all the camera gear you will need for a typical shoot. It also looks low key enough not to identify that you are carrying expensive camera gear, meaning it looks like any other back pack a student might carry.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I remember my dad reading this book to me as a child.  I found this for download and couldn't wait to read to my own kids.  They all laughed just like I did.
B005LAII44|3.0|Main reason to watch this was to see Channing Tatum...as it says under the title of the movie & has his picture real big on the cover.  But, i couldn't believe it...he gets killed off in the beginning!!! What the heck?? How misleading and oh! so disappointing!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I purchased this album because I am a huge fan of Lindsey Stirling first and foremost. I really love here sound and have much love for the violin. It's a great mix of classical and modern. I am talking about dubstep, rock, hip/hop. If you are looking for something new then I would definitely suggest this album. It's the best thing since sliced bread. Also, it makes you want to dance if you like that sort of thing.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I bought this Portable Digital Recorder for recording in the field and the occasional impromptu show or event.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  The case is enclosed with a rubberized plastic which gives a nice grip and adds to durable protection to the unit.  The x/y patterned mics are incredibly sensitive, capture a wonderful field of sound and can be rotated to tweak the exact field of sound desired.  One deciding factor for purchasing this unit was the (2) XLR inputs.  With these inputs, I can add any external microphone I so desire.  This means I can bring along my studio condenser and/or a shotgun mic for any kind of recording need.  Also, through the USB connection, this recorder can be used as a Audio Interface with your computer.  So if I need to record directly into my DAW or audio recording software, I can easily assign this recorder as my input.<br /><br />My only real con is that the boot up time for this unit is painfully slow.  If I am somewhere in the field and need the unit to pick up sound immediately, I have to wait 30-45 seconds for it to boot.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this unit to anyone wanting a robust and utilitarian portable recorder.<br /><br />_________________________________<br /><br />I have had this unit for 2 years now and it's been all over the country.  It has travelled well.  I would definitely buy a RedHead windscreen for this unit to cut any wind noise, as the attached mics are super sensitive.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|If you are an avid fan...this is worth it....amazing... I have wanted this box forever...Worth the wait! beautiful wooden box with glass door!
B00BI73CVI|1.0|There are three distinct chapters to the Les Mis story. First and foremost is the original book by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862.  It eventually became considered one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century. As early as 1935 an english language film adaptation of the book became the second chapter. As the book was an enormous 1500 pages long, it was understandable that the movie was limited in how the story could be re-told. There have been several film (and television) adaptations since that early version and all have been limited by how much they can fit into a relatively short period of time. The third chapter was written when two french men, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg decided to try and produce the story as a musical in 1980.  It originally only lasted about three months and was severely criticized by the literary world.<br /><br />How ever, just as there is a faction which enjoys great literature, there is a faction which just as fervently enjoys great music and with the english version of the musical (lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer and supported by Cameron Mackintosh of theatrical production fame) the musical became a resounding success.<br /><br />So there we have the three distinct chapters, the book, the film adaptation and finally the musical.  It should be remembered that the musical was produced in the realm of a stage production. As a consequence, the performers needed very little in the facet of acting experience but they did need to have studied theatrical production and of course, have the ability to sing. It is because the casts chosen for the various theatrical productions were chosen for these reasons that the stage production became (and still is) such a success.<br /><br />And now we have those who would like to add a fourth chapter. A film adaptation of both the book and the musical.  Now this is a combination which could only work if those chosen to portray the various characters could both act and sing. And unfortunately whoever was responsible for \\"casting\\" this production seemed to concentrate more on a performers acting ability than on their singing ability. Perhaps it was considered that as a movie, it needed the \\"big name\\" acting stars to be successful.<br />After all, who would want to go and see a movie full of \\"unheard of\\" actors, no matter how good their singing ability.<br /><br />Ultimately, the production failed to produce what it was originally intended to produce. Even the \\"big name\\" stars efforts suffered because of their lack of musical talent. Hugh Jackman, in his own right is a very accomplished actor but his acting performance suffered simply because he did not have the musical capacity to deliver the necessary combination of acting/singing.  And poor old \\"Rusty\\" Crowe. Mumbling and bumbling along in one of the most mono tone efforts at singing that it was difficult to know which were his spoken words and which were sung. The whole performance was only held together by some of the smaller name performers,like Eddie Redmayne (a suprisingly good performance as Marius) Aaron Tveit as Enjolras and good old Colm Wilkinson (an old and bold from the theatre) as the bishop.<br /><br />Overall, if they had simply tried to make a movie adaptation of the book (and leave the music to the satge) they may have had some chance of success and that would have left the three chapters of the Les Mis story intact.  If the fourth chapter is ever going to become a success and take it's part in the history of Les Mis, then they will need to keep in mind that they will need to find performers who can both act and sing.  At the time of writing this review, they have yet to find the combination which works.<br /><br />When Cameron Mackintosh was finally convinced to take on the stage production of the musical, he was unsure of the outcome but he took his time and finally with the help of a lot of people in the theatre business and a couple of years work, he put together a very succesfull production. It was a pity that he seemed so eager to rush headlong into this movie production. If he had approached it with the same degree of caution which he gave the stage production, he may well have succeeded.  Unfortunately he didn't and just as unfortunately, he failed.
B0072OFM28|3.0|Having recently revisited \\"Blood and Sand\\" and \\"Gods of the Arena\\" for the first time since their original run and the finishing of \\"War of the Damned\\"<br />It is apparent that \\"Vengeance\\" is the red-headed stepchild of the Spartacus series.I'm sure the untimely death of Andy Whitfield was the primary reason for<br />this. No offense to Liam McIntyre, but he just wasn't up to Whitfield in acting chops or intensity in the role. To his credit Liam did grow more comfortable<br />in the role and by the final season had made his own interpretation of Spartacus, not bad, but not up to Whitfield standards. Much worse was Cynthia Addai-Robinson taking over the role of Naevia from Lesley-Ann Brandt. The woman can't act herself out of a paper bag. For two seasons the only emotions she showed<br />were anger and rage. She made a complex character totally one dimensional. Add in the confusion added by taking what was meant to be a 12 episode season<br />squeezed into 10 episodes with many story lines dropped or left permanently unresolved and you are left with a season that does the required advancement of<br />the story, but in a uninspired and barely adequate way. The final season,\\"War of the Damned\\" is a great improvement, with the exception Addai-Robinson, who<br />still is woefully inadequate in the role of Naevia.
B00AQ08W22|4.0|Need I say more?<br />I liked this better than the original. The only problem was the constant use of the s-word. It was almost as if the writers were like, &#34;I don't know what they should say here. Just have them curse again.&#34; - really unnecessary.<br />Other than that, this was a fun movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I loved it once I picked it up and I can't stop playing on it. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel Washington is great in this movie.  Movie was well writting and very captivating!  I reallly enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B000YH6YG8|4.0|This movie was amazing! Had issues watching it on instant view but other wise this movie was awesome really makes you think about things
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was really good and had me very into it from the beginning till the end, it also left speechless. I had major water works in lot of areas, but I think it was like none stop after around 60% till the end.  Dean and Sky are just prefer for each other. This book is a must read. Wishing for more of Dean and Sky!!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This story swung from despair to laughter, from almost grasped completeness to inevitable loss.<br />It grapples with a contemporary issue that has probably crossed all our minds and made us ponder the &#34;what if&#34;.<br />The sign of a good book to me is the length of time it stays with me after finishing reading .<br />It still remains in my heart.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|we love this series its always full of surprises and very good acting , my husband and I are on Season 7 already we can't get engough of it .
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Really enjoyed the way the story was told with flashbacks in a way that the whole plot was quite unpredictable.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few days and so far I am really enjoying playing it it will keep you busy for at least 30 minutes without realizing the time. All around a fun game.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|I purchased this knife about 2 wks ago.<br /><br />First of all, the heft, weight and ergonomics says \\"I'm not Messing around.\\"<br /><br />Good sheath, I'll be replacing it, though(I like leather).<br /><br />The steel is excellent, holds a scary sharp edge for a good while of utility jobs around the campsite...<br /><br />NOW:<br /><br />When I received this knife, the edge was so horribly ground at the factory:<br /><br />- The tip of the blade was ground left a full 1/16\\" off of the remaining length of the edge.<br />- the shoulder, about 1/3 of the way into the curve of the blade had to lose a further 1/32\\" of metal to achieve even a glimpse of forming an edge. it was absolutely blunt, as in butter-knife for a solid 3/4\\"...<br /><br />I spent a solid 5-6 hours with whetstone and a Spyderco Tri-Angle ceramic sharpener to get this blade right. It turns out I ended up con-caving the edge, but given the thickness of this blade(And the amount of excess metal I had to remove) it would've happened eventually. Not even close to the quality I expected from Ka-Bar.<br /><br />The end result, though, is FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Beautifully executed tool -  given the right care, the BK-2 will last forever.<br /><br />This would have been a 5 star review for the overall quality of this product - Ka-Bar, Get it together!<br /><br />Highly recommended, with reservations.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Very well done biopic picture worth while to watch if you looking for a good one to watch but it has a sad ending
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The best movie I have ever watched. Those who whine about the vocal ability of the actors miss the boat. This is not about music so much as it is about the human kind. Don't bother to watch it if you don't have a soul.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Wish with every level up an increase in cash/green dollars would occurs, like on CityVille. Other than that it's cool...
B000JCQCW4|5.0|If you love movies you will love this one.  It is totally good and for people who love creative movies.  VERY WELL DONE!!!
6305949980|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and a great price. Watched it with my greatgrandaughter. We both loved it.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I didn't like it, I really don't know what to say other than I didn't like it. Needs to be a little more up to date.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love these renditions of popular music done with the sensibility of classical music.  My favorite is the beginning of the Star Wars, but don't care for the percussion added after the intro.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|i think it's a cool app, so far it's been working pretty good for me, I just wish I could change the color of the app icon.
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|This book took me by surprise for one reason, the plot. I love how original the plot is and how well written the book is in executing it to readers.<br /><br />Mary is a ghost so to speak with a mission to help her living loved one, but along the way she encounters some not so pleasing people who ultimately force her into making a choice, for better or unintentionally worse.<br /><br />If you like to mix things up and enjoy something a bit different, but entertaining, then this book will be a great fit for your reading pleasure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Kept my attention - wanted to keep watching - did not want to put it down.  Good character development & period dress
B0094M4R3Q|1.0|Started out ok about a little girl whose parents were too selfish to notice that their little girl could read at an early age. They leave her home alone every day and she starts going to the library by herself and devouring books. They finally allow her to go to a school where the children are exposed to an insane headmistress who taunts a fat boy, abuses the teachers.  The film ends with the girl's parents giving her to her teacher while they move away and leave her. Not something you want your children to watch! Not something anyone could enjoy watching. I can't imagine why Danny DeVito would get himself involved in such a stupid movie.
B004G8P3HW|4.0|I whole-heartedly relate.  Weaving familial stories, wisdom gleaned during ever-changing times, personal hopes and failures, all into the tapestry of one`s own life is hard work. Making sense of it all and thriving in spite of or because of it all is a remarkable victory. Cary seems to have done just that. I`m still learning.
B004LROUW2|2.0|I'm in the middle and it is starting to drag and get too mundane in the detailed descriptions, the first 'book' of the three books in this novel was easy to read and enthralling
B008KZVNLC|4.0|I anxiously awaited the movie I had ordered from Amazon.on line. Anticipating the highly advertised PARADES END because my favorite actor was assuming a comedic role in the film , something very unusual for him to do. I had seen many screen clips of his performances and they were very amusing. He was to appear in several scenes according to the advertisements.  To my dismay the film I received only had a three second appearance in one scene. Not at all what was in the ads. This is just a bare bones synopsis of the movie, Parades End takes place at the end of World War 1, creating, in this story, a London populated by aristocrats and high society. The plot is very intricate and involved, it moves slowly and can be confusing at times. We are introduced to a shrewish wife who has been unfaithful and her husband who finds himself amazingly attracted to a vivacious young woman. Sub-plots involving supporting players adds depth to the movie. I recommend PARADES END to those who prefer long , intricate and slightly opaque films full of a variety of interesting charactes. I can only say I missed the reverend  so very much!
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved this book.  I enjoyed it way more than Fifty Shades.  Although an intense relationship between Eva and Gideon, I just felt is was more believable than that between Christian and Anastasia.  There are A LOT of sex scenes, so many that I began to skip over them.  I love a good erotic scene as much as the next person, but this was really overkill.  I understand the couple uses sex as a coping mechanism, so it's part of the story, but sometimes less is more.  Another reviewer commented on how every character is described as being gorgeous and it was annoying.  I agree with that.  It was like everyone stepped off the stage of America's next top model.  And everyone was very, very rich, which also annoyed me.  Nobody had regular income, it was overkill.  In Fifty Shades, Ana pretty much left her friends behind because she was all consumed with her man, but I like how in this story Eva doesn't do that.  She and Gideon are ALWAYS together it seems, but she still makes time for others in her life.  I purchased this and second book at the same time, and I'm glad I did because with the ending of this book, you'll want to make sure you have the next one ready to go.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It wasn't all I expected it to be. After reading the book, I was a little disa ppointed in the movie, but it was ok.
B001NZU7GI|5.0|This is Clapton at his finest. I have loved this recording for years,. Now I have it again. A great deal.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|CG's were good, but story line is old and dated. Too much bang, bang shut'em up and not enough plot.
B0043JEA14|5.0|The Doobie Brothers keep reinventing themselves in this album.  When many bands that hvae been playing since the 70's start to lose their vocal and musical abilities this album is definitely not the case.  Tom Johnston never sounded better in many songs on this album.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Set in a time about 100 years ago, and in another culture, but people just like you and me, facing choices and making good and bad decisions, and facing the consequences.  I love almost all of the characters.  (not Thomas! but he has his place, too)  One thing that comes through is that each person knows his &#34;place&#34; in life, and it's an honorable place regardless of birth or status.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|This movie delves into the underworld of secret sex parties.  This man opens pandora's box and get's caught up and does not know how to close it before it ruins his marriage.  This is a movie where you need to have an open mind.  It is accompanied by a lot of mysterious music, that leaves you wondering.
B00637HXNG|5.0|Wouldn't play on my Samsung BlueRat (I believe it's a 2550), but I hijacked my kids' PS3 and that worked.  I forgot how many good songs they did.  I played it at a gathering where my brothers (in their mid 40's) were present and they LOVED IT.
B0060MYM3S|1.0|The second season begins to bring in ugly looking characters that seem unreal.  The story becomes so convoluted that it seems hard to follow.  The first season was good enough to encourage me to buy the second season.  Big mistake.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
0439023513|1.0|Hunger Games and Catching Fire are both brilliant books but Collins seemed to have run out of steam on this one, and eventually so did I. Yep I didn't even finish it, it was that bad. After the cliffhanger ending and incredibly strong sequel of Catching Fire I was entirely captivated by this storyline but what happens is Mockingjay starts out slow... And stays slow. Katniss is a whiney brat and now is putting the rebellion through hell and throwing temper tantrums at every turn, throwing blame on those who are just trying to help her. But the worst is that the 4/5 of the book is just Katniss filming stupidity \\"propros\\" for the war instead of actually fighting. I kept waiting for the propros to end and the action to begin but even when they got to the Capitol what did they do? I gave up at the point. What a waste of a great story... Quite a shame really.
B005LAJ212|4.0|It keeps you wondering what comes next and both my wife and I enjoyed watching each episode.  I will look forward to a second season if such exists.
B008J34466|5.0|She is one of the few artists out today that I will buy the entire album even before hearing it.  She always surprises, has fun and is amazing.  Highly recommend.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Great book I like the plot of it. The characters of the book are good characters. You should sell it free
1467934925|5.0|This is a involved and semi-hard/long read - but an important one.  Cuts through the intentionally murky and misleading fluff and nonsense reported on the nightly news and in national political discussions, and brings something not seen in a long while to a issue and policy discussion:<br />Facts.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0025KW29U|3.0|The bluray picture quality is solid, but it seems to lack detail. For a movie that I think was shot digitally, there is a large amount of grain. However, it includes the very funny &#34;Commentary the Musical&#34; which almost makes up for it.<br /><br />The movie itself is very good, and for the price of the Bluray it is worth getting.
B004RE29PO|5.0|This version - with this clarity - it how this movie should always be seen!  It was a scary-fun thrill ride when it came out, and it's even better in a dark room now!  Enjoy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because this is a finger exercise and it is a bit addictive and fun I can not remove my face off the device.
B002SQFZ68|3.0|I love these guys - but Jon never once looked like he was into this concert and they don't play much of the old stuff.  I have all their new releases and like them too - but the reason they are as popular as they are is from the 80s and 90s catalog, little of which is on this album.  It's a nice concert video, but mainly just for background music.  I wouldn't recommend this one.
B00498YZH8|4.0|I liked Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal, there were little things that she said or small jestures she made that gave me a sense that she was truly that character. I also liked most of the acting, especially the little girl, I think she is a natural and will be great when she grows up. Some of the events in the script seem implausible enough to ask yourself, why would anybody do that, but not enough to make me dislike the movie as a whole.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I didn't see this one coming - lol! a movie named &#34;Paul&#34; really?  - lol<br /><br />This is hands down one of the most creative, well planned and executed movies you will ever see.  Smart, funny and a kick of a ride all the way through!  Buy it - you'll watch it over and over!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Too bad they took this off the air, enjoyed the characters.  The ending is different than what I expected, definitely wanted more...
B00A8ECU24|3.0|the game crashes frequently, losing progress and content. in app items don't deliver and developer doesn't do anything to resolve it.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Having seen the first film made of Les Miserables and also having been to the stage play in London. Also seeing both Royal Albert performances this for me was a large let down. The acting was fair and the singing terrible. Also they did not stick to the true story right from the beginning. Sorry but for me it was a total disappointment.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|While the chandelier doesn't actually &#34;fall&#34; in this production....the voices are exquisite and you can actually understand EVERY word and note!  The singers/actors faces express every emotion to a &#34;T&#34;.  Best version EVER!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome so many games to play its just awesome when I bought this I thought it would sick but turns out it was worth my time
B00AA0U046|5.0|Great collection of seemingly lost Hendrix material. The man was a genius and forever creative artist. Comes with an awesome full color booklet insert with info about all of the sessions and epic Jimi photos!! A must have for any Hendrix fan!
B0013KTGAG|5.0|As if Cillian Murphy wasn't scary enough as The Scarecrow in Batman, he is just as eerie in a regular role. I am not a fan of horror movies, but I found myself unable to look away. Excellent thriller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.I play it all the time.my dad saw me playing and said it was so<br />Cool. Its the best

1597774987|3.0|I read the Kindle sample, which includes only the prologue and the first chapter. It looks like it was never proofed--missing punctuation, commas in the wrong place, misspellings and an inexplicable overuse of the ellipsis. Aside from these editorial issues, it was still a good read, and I tempted to buy it. The price is right. LoL
B00846REIS|5.0|New lovers fight their demons and insecurities in this love story that will leave  you racing to the book store for the next title in the Crossfire series.
B008220C38|1.0|You wouldn't think it could be possible that someone could ruin a movie with Keira Knightley in it and such a great story, but they did. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a movie before. I guess my expectations were way too high. I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. The only reason I gave it that long was because I honestly couldn't believe that it could possibly continue to be that bad but it was! It's like the movie was being turned into a play and adding entertainment and comedy to such a story was just an unbelievably bad choice. Words can't even describe how bad this was. I am truly at a loss for words and I wish I could be more articulate so nobody else wastes their money or time on this disaster of a movie! Thankfully I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste any $ on it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Well written, interesting plot, the characters are well developed. A lot of unexpected twists, a book that has it all.
B001TW68P4|5.0|this gem brings back lovely memories. I recommend it for everyone.  Anyone who loves 60's music should own this wonderful cd
B003O86FMW|1.0|The first book of the hunger games was amazing!So I thought why not read the next book so I did.The first part didnt even impress me it talked about how she came out and what gettibg hunt down by the capital,and Gale go whiped…it also whent on how she didnt really love peta (the first part honestly made me bored)and im not that picky of a reader but if the first part doent make a impression the the rest of the book didnt eather (I even skipped some pages I was so bored) but I went back and read it again most of the book just foucuses on the capital and the people being rebelus,because she was the mocking bird.She was the symble of peace but the capital was getting in the way of her.She was getting destroyed part by part mentaly and physicaly (she wasnt fighting that nuch it would have made it better tho)eventally her whole distract gets distroyed abd shes trying to run away from everything that they shoot at her(its to predictable)thats what made it such a bad book for me.Then Peta also was trying to save her (whats the point?he was supposte to be killed anyways)the capital wanted to kill peta too(what a surprise!) I wish they would have just ended the book like that but they didnt because she clearly made another seris but some people like this book but you shouldnt even waste your time,the first book is the only good book out of every single other book in the seris so I wouldnt recomend this book to naby people because of it horrible plot.But over all I guess you should just read all the seris if you want too see what happeneds in the end.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I thought I purchased a cover for my kindle--well, I got a cover, but also a stand that will hold the kindle either in portrait or landscape mode.  In addition, there's the ability to insert your hand in an area to hold your kindle and a elastized strap which will hold it closed or hold it open.  So many details--so convenient!  I LOVE it!!!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|DANIEL CRAIG & JAVIER BARDEM were FABULOUS - THE SCENERY CHOICES & THE PHOTOGRAPHY were WORLD CLASS + The MIND BLOWING PYROTECHNICS made for a TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE...
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Though I thought less of the movie than the book,, the images were quite satisfying.  There were moments when the story line were unclear such as the ending.  Some of the images were a bit too contrived.  Having experienced ocean storms I thought these images to be both striking and true.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I'm impressed and satisified with the quality of this new Justin Hayward CD.  As of the last 20 years, it seems that Justin saves his best songs for his solo outings.  His last two solo efforts - The View From the Hill and Spirits of the Western Sky - are seemingly superior in quality and \\"craftmanship\\" to what one would generally find on the the two latest Moody Blues albums.<br /><br />My favorite song off this album is \\"western sky\\", and in my opinion it is one of the best songs that Justin Hayward has written in his career.  \\"On the Road to Love\\" is a great uptempo tune. and \\"One Day, Someday\\" is another tune that demands repeated listens.  I also enjoy the lead track, \\"In your Blue Eyes\\".  Actually, I find something to enjoy in all of the songs on this CD.<br /><br />Justin did record 3 bluegrass/country music styled songs for this CD.  Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of bluegrass, however, I thought Justin's bluegrass styled recordings were interesting.<br /><br />Overall, a good quality CD that I'd recommend for purchase.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|The Movie was Awesome.<br />The cast was Awesome.<br />The way Amazon Presented the Movie was Awesome.<br />It was a nice way to relax.
B00094OBS4|5.0|I must respectfully disagree with some other reviews posted here. I have been playing guitar for over 50 years and I am not a professional but I am considering buying this DVD. It has a variety of guitarists who actually did play the Stratocaster and had something to do with it and/or with rock guitar from its inception.<br />Amazing that Hank Marvin is still around and his songs were good here. He genuinely seems to enjoy giving his performance. Joe Walsh is Joe Walsh, he is a professional and his songs demonstrated the range of his contributions from the James Gang to his solo career and to the sound of the Eagles, including slide and the talk box. I hadn't realized he had so many different hits. Amy Winehouse looked nervous, it was a big crowd, and she had a sound and style that had virtue, and her guitarist had a cool light blue metallic Strat and he and Ms. Winehouse made some good music together. Albert Lee has a niche and he can certainly play his licks. I may try to figure some of them out by watch this video.<br />Lacking Jeff Beck or Eric Clapton, well maybe they weren't available or charged too much, you can get videos of those great guys elsewhere.<br />Ronnie Wood having a raspy voice?  So what?  He is a Rolling Stone!<br />David Gilmour's performance was truly stratospheric so to say. Respectfully, he gives us hope that we can keep rockin that long, he is a living legend. He is truly a proponent of the Stratocaster and his sound has evolved over the decades. He has been rated #1 Rock guitarist in the world in a British poll I saw and I saw why in this performance where he seemed to give it his all. Such sensitivity of feeling and subtleties were conveyed in these songs, the brushing of the strings, I don't know what, his performance was transcendental here, worth the price of the DVD alone in my opinion.
1401323820|5.0|this was a gift for my husband.  We are huge fans of the show and he wanted to just buy one to see if it was as good as the show.  He had a little trouble with the names in the book being different from the names in the show, but it was not a deal breaker and he did enjoy the read.  We will be buying the rest of the series for him as soon as we get the list together.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is Abraham Lincoln. I feel I met a great American in person. The profound story along with the overpowering sight of fields of dead soldiers is almost too much to bare. A period in American history that made this country one nation. Acted with perfection and brought to life by Director Steven Spielberg. The viewer is also rewarded by an outstanding performance by Tommy Lee Jones. The word &#34;Masterpiece&#34; does not say enough.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Plot and characters good.  They strength for me is the engineering and science.  Detailed explanations of how the marsbase equipment works, and what can break, and what happens when it does (which it does a lot).
B0095P3ULC|1.0|If you have literally nothing left to do in your life, I suppose there might be worse things to watch. Shia LeBeof plays his same 'mini Vince Vaugn' he does in everything, Rosie Whatever-Huntington can't act. Just really hard to care for anyone in this movie and even harder to remember. The plot is typical nonsense, utterly predictable, not that you'll remember. Specials effects are meh, the robots are so ridiculously complicated you can't tell whose who. Not that it matters since you are watching this just to see shiny things blow up, right?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great u will love this games it get faster and faster there is lots of character s
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|Great story to kick off the series! I like all the books and I wait anxiously for any new ones. I found this author by accident and I am so glad I did!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|It was pretty good.  I was disappointed that it ended and another story began in season two.  I thought it would be like Downton and be a continueing story.
1616890835|5.0|Art coming in many forms. This book spotlights the art of sign painting. What a talent! I will never walk by a sign again without appreciating the artist who created it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The three books about Lisbeth Salander and the saga of her life are very well written.  This book, the third and last of the trilogy continues her story to a stunning end.  A finely crafted book.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|We're not sure we liked the singing of every word.  Musicals<br />are great with songs interspersed, but this was a bit much.<br />It's a wonderful story and one that should be told.  AND the<br />actors did their jobs WELL, but ---------
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I didn't go into this movie expecting much but I really enjoyed it, its great for the whole family and if you do any kind of animation you'll love the effects they've put into this.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie deserved every award it received and then some!<br />It's an amazing true story and we're so glad that President<br />Clinton de-classified the details so that this man could receive the kudos he deserved.<br />Everyone should see it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I absolutely love this keyboard. I use it with English, Russian and Ukrainian, and it anticipates the word I might use next in all three of those languages. Now THAT is cool!<br />I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to swipe and/or type, expecially to those working in languages besides English.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|this book was interesting most of the time, dark some of the time, but mostly a great story that held my interest. I look forward to the third and final book in the series.
B003GK2216|4.0|As it happens with all sagas, I think the first one was much better.<br />Looking forward to the third part.
B005UD1E02|5.0|As always it lets your imagination connect with the realm of reality and the possibility of the future. I have read all his books and wasn't sure what to expect given the colaboration. I was not dissapointed. Well worth the read. I was in Hawaii when I read it so it gave another dimension to the book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Just as much fun as the first game and more options/better graphics! I highly recommend this app! SAMURAI VS ZOMBIE 2
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. While I knew a few things about Tesla I learned quite a bit more about him when I read this book. The book is very well written and is very informative. I also learned a few things about Thomas Edison that I did not know. I was shocked to find out how he treated Tesla. However, Tesla didn't let Thomas Edison, or anyone else, stop him from turning his ideas into reality. Yea Tesla! Great message in that for us all.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|I have read countless reviews of people claiming that Bon Jovi lost it's touch or \\"Fooled Again\\" these fans truly are not real Bon Jovi fans and have not kept up with what was described in interviews or even [...] fan page.  Bon Jovi goes back to \\"Lost Highway\\" success in hopes of picking up where they left off there in Nashville.<br /><br />The Results: Very Good<br /><br />I would not give it an Excellent Review by any means, but there are some very good songs on here that I have enjoyed listening to over and over again. Some of these have a real hard punch to them and excellent beat<br /><br />My personal Favorites include:<br /><br />1. Because We Can (10 out of 10)<br />2. Amen  (10 out of 10)<br />3. I'm with you  (U2 or Springsteen sound)(9 out of 10)<br />4. That's what the water made me  (well done)(10 out of 10)<br />5. What's left of me (10 out of 10)<br />6. What about now  (8 out of 10)<br />7. Pictures of you  (9 out of 10)<br /><br />The few I really could care less for<br />1. The Fighter<br />2. Thick As Thieves (though it gets better as the song goes on)<br />3. Army of One ( would make a decent B-Side Song- but not close to being a \\"Hit\\")<br /><br />While unlike \\"Lost Highway\\" you don't have the country feel or the violins in the back ground.  It has a very Bruce Springsteen type of rock or U2 feel to this one.<br />However, I can empathize with many out there, who love Bon Jovi as a Hard Rock band and not a slow rock band.  I would love for them to revisit \\"Slippery When Wet\\" or \\"New Jersey\\" or a combination of the two, but you will not get that one here and it was said well before that this was the direction they were going with this new CD.<br /><br />Overall:  It's a very good CD to listen to, and to tap your foot too or sing a long.  Very Enjoyable.  If your only interested in up tempo Hard Rock sound, your better off moving onto something else like Daughtry, Nickelback,or even picking up the newest Great White (new lead singer).  I still love Bon Jovi!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It is a good game I would recumend it.I only don't like how long it takes to get more energy.But my family plays this game.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|&#34;Flight&#34; has a terrible beginning.  It's a sickening introduction to what could have been a good movie!  Don't submit yourself to this movie!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Clay Jannon, out of work web designer, takes a night job at a 24-hour book store and stumbles into a Brotherhood with roots going back to the infancy of the printed word.  His cursorily over an accidently discovered pattern slowly draws both old friends and new friends into a complex maze of medieval legend and cutting edge computers.  This book is a complete delight.  It starts down a familiar path, but then veers off into virgin territory that will leave you thinking that there really is something new under the sun.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Great series and a great collections i cant wait till the next season come out.  it all the quality of the video was excellent, cause its blu ray and the case is good quality, its not cheaply made.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I am a perennial Hendrix nut, but not one of the True Believers, so much of this music is really news to me.  Some songs I have heard, of course, in other incarnations, but this is really a good release and worthy of the Jimi Hendrix name.<br /><br />Mainly, I have to rate this one highly in terms of listenability - it just runs right along with stellar playing throughout and great song selection.  The &#34;Hear My Train a Coming&#34; version here seems like what might have landed on a Jimi studio album, as opposed to the long, searing live versions previously heard.  This version is quite interesting.<br /><br />Experience Hendrix is doing great work!  I have to say, I really appreciate all of their releases - I really enjoy South Saturn Delta and Valleys of Neptune, listen to them a lot, but have to rate this as my favorite of their (non-Jimi-lifetime) releases.<br /><br />Play on, brother
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Mind blowing ending. I wasn't ready for how this ended, it blew me away. I couldn't stop reading this long into the night until I finished it. Amazingly written, one of the best books I've read in a very long time..into the minds of mad men this one goes.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Some decent individual performances but anyone who has seen the actual musical is going to be disappointed.  Samantha Barks (Eponine) holds back her powerful voice to avoid embarrassing the film actors.  If you don't believe me check her out in the Les Mis 25th Anniversary Special.
B00371XIJE|5.0|This is a slow but moving tale of love and loyalty that had our whole family of boys in tears.
B004J64QR4|5.0|Great performances and some amazing encores at the end that have multiple actors who played key roles over the years singing together.  An absolute must see for anyone who likes Les Mis.
B005VOXQ1U|4.0|My wife has what can truthfully be called a menagerie of animal figurines. Most are from Schleich for good reason: superior quality. They are realistic looking, right down to the facial expressions, they are well designed--I've yet to see one that failed to stand or sit (depending on the pose) properly and securely (some lower quality figurines wobble or topple over), and they are made of a &#34;well-behaved&#34; plastic material (no strange odors or greasy feel). My one objection is that my wife looks back and forth between the adult gorilla and me, then mumbles something about a strong family resemblance. One of these days...
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson in general, and this book is an amazing addition to his already stellar works.
0307895475|5.0|Awesome, great entertainment for hours on end.  A few software bugs but they are continuing to sort them out.  If for some reason you haven't tried this game already, do yourself a favor and give it a try.
B0086HGW42|3.0|Some of the songs do not appeal to me as I thought it would.<br /><br />However, it's a great album. I do recommend.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|The game needs better instructions as to what you are supposed to accomplish and what materials you are confined to.
B005C3FY7Y|5.0|this album is great except for were not gonna take it and i wanna rock, every other song is killer! i saw this tour twice in 1984 and they were just as good live, as person who truly appreciates good rock and metal i would highly recomend stay hungry on vinyl!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005L38QK2|4.0|It's a great gaming mouse. You can customize the keys, it includes a left mode, two different sensitivity settings, glows red, and you can adjust how it glows. My only problem I've had is every now and then (very rarely) is my mouse cursor seems to have a \\"seizure\\" and the only way to fix it is to move the mouse back and forth very quickly. Firmware upgrades seems to have helped the problem, but I still run into it now and then. Other than that, no problems at all.<br /><br />Update 12/10/13<br />Firmware updates seemed to have stopped those seizures I mentioned (I completely forgot about those, actually!). The only problem I am having now is that after a while, my mouse software seems to just quit, so I have to manually start it back up. Other than that, no issues.
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|i love this album always have since it came out in 83, alot of people dont like it because its not ozzy, there are some killer songs on here zero the hero,disturbing the priest,trashed digital bitch and the title track are my favorites.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My mother mentioned one evening a few monthas back that she had never seen To Kill a Mockingbird. I went on le to Amazon and ordered it for her. She was so excited and we watched it together over two nights. She loved it and I loved it again. Thank youvery much.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is very fun. there are lots of different pony's you can buy and I love the mini games where you collect apples!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This season follows the books pretty well.  Not perfectly, but what show/movie has ever followed a book perfectly?  Casting and the sets have been real solid so far.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is from now on one of my go to authors.  The writing style and organization make this anything but a dry boring read!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This season follows the books pretty well.  Not perfectly, but what show/movie has ever followed a book perfectly?  Casting and the sets have been real solid so far.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love because it has animals and I love animals so if you love animals you will love the game and so please get the game it is free
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|Don't know what the hype is all about.  This is a horrible movie.  The violence is just way to violent, and the story line is corny.  Don't waster your time or money.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This was surprisingly fun. The characters were well thought out and gained my daughters attention.  Anything with dogs is a plus!
B005K17RU0|4.0|A really good tool for checking the forecast.  It helps with work to determine if and when bad weather is arriving.
B0053O89IS|5.0|The product arrived well within the projected delivery dates. I began watching the DVDs as soon as I got home that night from work. The DVDs worked perfectly and I was completely impressed. I loved it. Getting home after a long night at work in the food service industry can be exhausting at times. The delivery of your product came at perfect time. I'm thrilled with your fast service, and I will continue to buy from you in the future.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|No bad language that I recall and if you like good cgi, it is very impressive in this movie.  The story was a bit lame and I thought the ending was anti-climactic and predictable.  :(  so 2 stars for the story  and 5 for the F/X.  3 average
B007FC3AAI|3.0|I really don't get into movies like this, it was bought as a gift for my daughter. So I really don't know how to rate this.
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|I rented it for my grandchildren ages 3, 7 & 9.  They watched the first 20 minutes or so and didn't want to watch anymore.
B002BWP49C|5.0|What can I say?  I loved it.  The 2 disc edition adds to my Twilight-mania, and I have enjoyed watching it.
1400052181|5.0|Good transaction, no issues with the seller, arrived as expected. Recommended this seller. No issues, the Book excellent. Very interesting from an ethics point of view read it for book club a big discussion regarding ethics and human experiments . Great price for book,
B005LAII12|4.0|The movie was great, but the quality of the DVD was not great.  There were spots where it 'stuck'.  We discussed sending it back but after a couple of attempts we were actually able to view the entire thing. So we kept it.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I really enjoy enjoy this game.  It gets a little repetive on into it but what game doesn't?  If you like old school Mario, you should definitely check this one out!
1476734941|4.0|I found the diet easy to follow.... and I have started to lose weight 4 1/2 lbs in 3 wks. So far I have not had a problem following the diet on staying on it...
B004UNX1LS|1.0|It crashes every time I click on a video!  This apps suck big time.  When it does decide to work I'll be able to watch one video and then it'll pop up saying Vevo had stopped working.
B00000ILDF|3.0|THe DVD arrived as promised in good condition. The reason I gave it 3 stars was do to the nature of the film. The story could have been better and the production was basic at best. Otherwise, still a good time in the Alien Anthology.
B00322PKAI|5.0|Keeps perfect time!  Non metallic for airline usage.  Went diving to 110' and no leaks!  Impressive watch.  I am buying more!<br /><br />John Eastman<br />Fort Lauderdale
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Excellent. I cannot for next year for the final book in the series. Very difficult to put down. Jeffery Archer stories grip ones attention
B007FEFLTO|3.0|There  we're too many characters  for me to follow. Some interesting  scenarios however and the book certainly gave the reader the flavor of what it must have been like living in those traumatic times that we're not so long ago.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game.  A few glitches need work but overall fun to play.  Takes a little long loading scenes.  Too many reward screens jumping out at same time.  Don't get a chance to see what you've won.  Scenery is great.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and play is fast. You can collect your power ups and use keys to open chests. Fast pace.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|even though i figured the outcome of the movie early on i still enjoyed the plot and the challenges she incountered
0880796863|5.0|This deck is a very good beginner's deck as it follows the original closely and is very bright and sharp. Don't mind the ridiculously tiny U.S. Games copyright on the bottom right corner. Save some money and get a Pam A or Pam B later rather than buy some mid-level deck that costs $300-500. Buy this instead; you'll like it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.  Following all the families from World War One through World War Two was fascinating and brought the history to life.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Who doesn't love a good movie. Great price too! A must see. Add it to your collection today! x x
B00785P2QC|4.0|Just leaving a review to get money. Takes a while to build up money but otherwise not too bad if you're into this kind of game
B006YMLE7G|5.0|I've seen this video multiple times with friends, and I still get pumped up watching this. The quality, animation, the story, all of it; pure genius and so very unique. I follow Takeshi Koike pretty well, and his directing is one of a kind. What also makes this video stand out is the amazing English voice-overs. Normally, I dislike or even hate them, but this has to be one of the better dubs out there in the entire anime market. This movie definitely deserves more attention then what it currently gets. If you enjoy sci-fi, racing (especially combat racing), anime (such as Gurren Lagann), and/or an amazing story, then you will absolutely LOVE this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I am glad to download this[[ASIN:B0083Q04IQ Kindle Fire 7\\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers]]
B008Y7J3UY|5.0|I walked out of the theater and said to my wife \\"I- I think that was the best movie I have ever seen\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it just like the movie it had passion killing and Love I can't wait for the second book
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|We had the same length cable with smaller wire and it didn't charge well. This cable is a little unwieldy being so long but a good charge.
B00BYH6MZK|3.0|The only reason I went to see this movie in the theater was because Kyle Chandler is in the cast. (He did a rash of movies after Friday Night Lights wrapped ... two more films which have yet to be released).  Plus with Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Marky Mark also in the cast ... it had to be pretty good.  Right?<br /><br />Well ... not so fast.  Out of all of Kyle Chandler's released, post FNLs films (Super 8, Argo, Zero Dark Thirty), this one isn't in the same league as the others.  It starts off at a good pace, a good reveal, but it quickly loses its way all the way through to its less than satisfying end.<br /><br />It's not a horrid film ... good cast, good acting, story is thin but it has its moments.  Just don't spend too much dough on it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really good even my friends say it's amazing. So far I have not had a problem and yea.
B004OXCL5Q|1.0|There is an indication on the viewing screne when it is booted up  that it does not play here in San Diego Blurays but only in Zone 4. I do not even know what that means. I am waiting for Amazon or the Seller to get back to me on this by providing input and a Bluray DVD of El Cid that plays in my Zone according to the Disk.
B0015AARJI|5.0|BUENO
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The product is amazing,although you could make the keys appear more often.Also,you might be able to purchase the keys from the shop and make them appear in multiples in super mystery boxes.Other than that it is a wonderful game.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Saw this in move theater and knew that I had to have it.  I do not buy many movies but this one was a must have ecen though I also own the CD as well!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all  books. Sad, but wandering if to will happen to our society someday.  Excellent book.  Kept me engaged until the last page was read.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|My grandson loves all dog movies, even though this is not a dog movie he loved it.  It will be played over and over again at my house.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|This is classic Jeffrey Archer!  Loved all three books but the ending left me wanting more.  Perhaps there is a fourth one on the way.  Recommend to any one who loves a good story.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Each time I watch the Good Wife, I can't wait for the next episode.  This series is exciting, suspenseful, and entertaining.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|This whole album is a good bit of a refreshing sound, good beats, great vocals, and an uplifting feeling. I got the vinyl issue, the record is pink, and, unlike colored vinyl of the sixties, seventies, and eighties, the quality of the record  is super, no surface noise like the many colored or picture disc albums of yesteryear.
B0018RFLN0|5.0|I was into the movie from beginning to end. Loved the action and way each scene played out throughout the entire movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|My wife and I bought the season because so many friends said they love the show.  We are 2 shows into season 1 and so far our expectations have been completely met.  We enjoy the story line and production of the show.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Great for funny pictures (also a great app not for children) or a pic you want to add text to, you can draw change millions of things and make a simple picture look very detailed great app!
B008B92U32|5.0|Want to have a good laugh, spent hours using this app and sending the results along to those involved.  Thanks to the developer it's been loads of laughter.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book shows a great story line, it makes you feel great love for the characters, and the characters are not just somebody in a story they have a amazing back story, i hope anybody who reads this book will feel the same!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It was an interesting story, with high excitement in the last 50 pages.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was keeping track of all the characters.  Overall, I rate it quite good.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is good just put some more in it like nether portals strong holds armor and author stuff like that ok
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I think its really great and very soothing.<br />I absolutely love it!  great way to fall asleep. So very relaxing.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is a very fun game but hard to get money with only a few Dinosaurs I don't like how u have to have 5 meat eaters to have code red but don't get me wrong it is every fun
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|While not a remake by any means, it's kind of like a modern princess bride. A fun, adventurous romance! Maybe with a dash of romancing the stone thrown in...
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden by Mark Owen takes the reader on a journey into the life and adventures of a member of DEVGRU. DEVGRU stands for Naval Special Warfare Development Group or more affectionately known as SEAL team Six. Mr. Owen takes you on a tour of the interview process, training involved, and acceptance to this elite team. He includes operations against Somali pirates, deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, culminating to the demise of America’s number one public enemy, Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />Mr. Owen broke his silence due to the government’s handling of Operation Geronimo. Why... for more in depth reasons, you’ll need to read the book. I will tell you this; Mr. Owen thought the reporting by the main stream media on the operation was funny, at first. It then became embarrassing, from the twisting of the facts to outright fabrication - rather than reporting the facts correctly. He felt that they and others needed to know the truth.* Mr. Owen wrote his account, only after he saw an interview on national television of President Obama and later on the Admiral in charge of the operation. Both persons were talking openly and in greater detail than most with a high level security clearance should.<br /><br />*In my humble opinion, the main stream media does not know what the “Truth” means.<br /><br />Mr. Owen went through great pains to hire a lawyer who was also a member of the Special Operations community to ensure that the government’s secrets, stay that way. Mr. Owen wanted to do something that was bigger than himself. Mr. Owen has given his profits to a multitude of organizations which are listed in the book.  I feel this is very noble. Not only am I recommending the book to anyone interested in the military particular Special Operations, but I’m endorsing Mr. Owen’s stance.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|Love this movie! Really glad to get it on bluray. Wouldn't say i notice a huge quality improvement though over non HD.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a must read. Sheryl Sandberg has put in writing everything that I have felt throughout my career. Kudos Mrs. Sandberg! Thank you for writing this book and starting a much needed conversation.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|Don't ask me why, it just does. It's not country, it's not rock, but man is it good. To be honest it took several listens to really like this album but once it clicked, good stuff.
1594487154|2.0|Of course, what can you expect from an author whose previous books include one with the subtitle \\"Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future\\"?<br /><br />Not much.<br /><br />In this book, he lost me 30-something pages in by claiming that teachers and health care professionals are really about sales.<br /><br />No, they're not.<br /><br />Arguably, teachers are about persuasion, in the increasingly sclerotic brainwashing that passes for K-12 education in America. But, per another reviewer, persuasion isn't exactly the same as sales.<br /><br />And, health care people, especially doctors, are NOT \\"about\\" sales. (Unless they have a financial investment in all the tests they order.)<br /><br />Instead, especially older male ones are \\"about\\" authority figures making pronouncements like Moses from Sinai.

B003XTUZIM|4.0|Compared to In The Court of the Crimson King, and even In The Wake of Poseidon; Islands definitely measures up.  The band was essentially playing in the style of their earlier hits when they made this one.  If that was their aim, then I would have to say that they accomplished their aim.  Notice that the volume isn't cranked on this one, and that is the sound of music before we had compressors.  I personally am fed up with the prevalence of compressors.  I think that they take away all the dynamic from music, and spoil it just to be loud.  In my opinion, if I want my music loud, then I'll just turn up the volume, and there is no need to compress anything.<br /><br />If you want to know where bands like Dream Theater and so many others got their sonic ideas, bands like King Crimson and Return to Forever were definitely influential to their sound.<br /><br />Also, you may notice that I essentially wrote the same review for both Lark's Tongues and Islands.  That is because I felt that the music of both of these cds is very similar.  Which is not to say that these albums are identical, but in my opinion, by the instrumental music alone, one would not be able to tell perhaps an unreleased B-side one of these cds from the other.  They are essentially the same in greatness.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|4.5 Stars... I really want to give it 5, but it didn't have that \\"can't put it down\\" quality for me. The ending is better than it could have been, which will only make sense when you read it. I must admit I figured out the \\"twist\\" long before it was revealed and I dreaded the point when it was talked about. Whenever I would come to a chapter about Jamie's childhood I would set the book down and walk away for a while, it was like I had to mentally prepare myself for it. More than once I had a tear roll down my cheek at the cruelty that was his life. So much sadness and yet he grew into such a loving, caring person. I definately recommend this book, but it is not for the faint of heart!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The darn cliff hangers at the end of each episode often have you watching the next episode in the series as well.

0385349947|5.0|Anyone who likes \\"Lean In\\" will find a good deal of interesting material in Breanne Fahs' erudite gray scale study of women's experience with regard to a variety of interesting situations -- \\"Performing Sex: The Making and Unmaking of Women's Erotic Lives\\" (SUNY Press)  Ms. Fahs' methodology makes the notion that inequality and unequal treatment of women is still the norm not only for leadership positions in the corporate world and politics, but also for life in the bedroom.  \\"Lean In\\" is all very well as far as it goes.  And \\"Lean In\\" seems well-written.  But the real question might be, will \\"Lean In\\" help anyone find their way out of the swamp? -- or will it help set our society on a path toward positive change?
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I depend on weather forecasts for my work outdoors. After monitoring TWC every 5 minutes this past friday....i was assured there was no wet weather coming up.<br />With zero notice we were DILUGED by a storm that LIT UP your competitor's radar. This weather cost me hundreds of dollars of ruined gear. I will never leave forecasting the weather to you  ever again.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This story will give you chills and touch your heart. A modest poet and talented performer who thought he'd had his shot at fame and fortune and missed. The money never mattered, only his music. Were the 40 years between his 2 albums and his rediscovery wasted, or did the continuing love and appreciation of his music by the South African people make him richer in ways he couldn't imagine? Experiencing their heartfelt admiration at his first concert in South Africa was amazing. How many people get to experience anything close to this in their lives?<br /><br />js
B00BDAP66E|5.0|This is easy to use for my work account, like the accessiblity for my job. Like that I can do it from home or when traveling.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Up until last week it was a wonderful app. If you are using this app on a kindle you will not br able to read it unless yoi have a magnifying glass. It WAS user friendly; I used to dpend hours reading it. After posting this review I will uninstall it.
B0081SKYDG|5.0|Seen this movie in the theaters, decided to own this movie since i don't own too many.<br /><br />Plenty of laughter, not a bad story line(obviously predictable), one of those late night movies to watch with your friends, family.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|There is a glitch on level 3-1. Right when it starts, Lep falls down and loses a life. Please fix this! Otherwise great game!
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did; but the vocals from lead cast members where painful to listen to. The only parts during which I stopped cringing were when the extras sang. While I admire the bravery of non-professional singers recording their lyrics live, I was begging for dubbing within the first five minutes. The female cast members sounded better, but the overall effect was not pleasant. While I also appreciate the realism of popular actors appearing to be visibly ravenged by poor diet and hard lives, the effect in HD is kind of gruesome. Overall, I found the combination of poor vocals with excessively realistic visuals and rapidly changing camera angles (close, far, stable, freehand, even off the actors faces onto random items...) to be a bit much. It was impossible to focus on the story. I hate to admit it, but I only made it about 45 minutes before I had to turn this movie off.

1608191664|1.0|signifying nothing, preying upon the dis-eased Social Darwinism narrative about capitalism already poisoning the minds of too many consumers and business owners alike. Perhaps a better title would be \\"23 Things They Don't Tell You About Educated Idiots\\". The Conscious Capitalism movement and Bloom's 'The Genius of the Beast' already tell us all that we need to know about how to elevate capitalism's practices to whole new levels while reminding people that capitalism ALREADY IS the most humane, the most creative, the most beneficial, and in fact the one true \\"messianic\\" force ever unleashed by mankind as a whole. The singular most important thing that must be done with capitalism right now is to wrest it from the incapable hands of governments' corporatism.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I've played a bunch of glu mobile games and this one's one of the best. It's super fun. It's a zombie game.....it's bound to be fun. I recommend this game to the zombie lovers out there.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|An incredible story of survival.  Its hard to believe people can in such a horrible place.  His struggle to adjust to a normal life was equally compelling.
B000FC11A6|2.0|I enjoy a good techno read but this one is akin to the History of Herodotus. You have to read it but its brutal at best. What is a great base line story is sunk by unneeded details and ADD style side tracked sub stories which have no relevance to what should have been a really good story, factual or not. Waisted pages of math equations, even as an engineer I found boring. Details that you would expect in a historically accurate account of events fall short in this fictional version of WWII code braking and current seven degrees of separation irony. Sorry, But I would not recommend this to my friends. I would have a lot of explaining to do.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|The best breath-taking book I ever read. This book is unpredictable. Very fast-paced and adventurous. The problems in this story will become amazing and twisted
B0002858YS|4.0|Hot Fuss is the debut album by Killers and was released in 2004 and is a mix of alternative rock, indie rock, post-punk revival, and  New Wave. Songs that stand out are Smile Like You Mean It and Somebody Told Me. Quite nice debut. Recommended. 4/5.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|Myself and my grandkids like playing this game. I like how you can earn more lives to keep playing. Would recommend this to anyone.
B0040HO16S|5.0|This show has been such a delight!!  I find myself thinking about it all the time since I started watching it.  I am so immersed into the character's lives.  The actors do so well in their roles.  I look forward to each episode and never want it to end, but sadly there are only 4 seasons.  It has been my escape from the real world.
B008220DIC|5.0|You will never see a better acted film in your life. The direction and cinematography are stunning, and really put you in the time period and in these character's shoes. Be sure to put on your thinking cap though. It seems many of the reviewers on Amazon only can appreciate simplistic ideas spoon fed to them, so of course they wouldn't follow this movie. Few movies have made me think or feel as much as this one has. Enjoy the feast. :)
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|2nd best movie about a kid being burgled. If you haven't seen it, see it now. You will love it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Amazing show! I love all types of supernatural shows and this is perfect. not bad on the eye candy too. I saw all the seasons within 3 weeks :)
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Once again the Bond movie franchise has delivered a smash hit.  The question now becomes, do they remake previous Bond movies or do they reboot the series like Star Trek.
0061353248|5.0|This is a foundational book of human behavior. A joy to read, everyone who is interacting with humans should read it!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Based on historical accounts a little too much artistic liberty was applied, a problem whenever working with true events.  Otherwise the movie was very good.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, along with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy in the fantasy catagory.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun game. I'm 11 and I still love it! It's very cool how they give you a daily challenge. I just think that the prices for boards and people is kinda outrageous. Other than that it is a wonderful game to play! :)
0385349947|5.0|First--I am a 55 year old male.  Frankly, I am very leary of management tomes.  Covey's books, as an example, were too simple, too &#34;self-helpish.&#34;  But after having read several excerpts and articles I picked up a copy of the book and was very impressed with it's no nonsense tone and down to earth approach.  I then purchased a copy for each of my managers.  The lessons and principles are directed toward women, but are applicable regardless of one's gender.  We, as a team, agreed that we should have our whole staff read the book as well.  Over the past weekend I also gave a copy to my 26 year old daughter, who, with her husband, are expecting their first child.  If you have daughters, if you have sons, if you are a leader, if you want to be a leader...its worth a read. And its worth sharing with others.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The sets so far have been great, but the while the episodes have been beautiful, they havent been the best o the series. Here's where it starts getting consistent. Not only are the stories uniquely STNG, the photography is colorful and richer. The promos for the set show amazing detail. This will undoubtedly be one of the best Bluray releases of the year!
0743270754|5.0|Finishing reading this book is a lifetime project!  Even though I love the subject and the author.  I guess I need to get &#34;snowed in&#34; for about a month!
B003V40SGS|4.0|I read the book years ago and did see the movie so as not to be disappointed. Good movie, the ending was slightle from what I remembered. The little spunky robot was the best of the lot
1451695195|1.0|Like other reviewers, I found very little of substance. The huge number of sales and reviews proves once again that the public is eager to swallow any garbage that offers hope, however false, and that is linked to religion. (If you look in a dictionary you will find very little difference between the definitions of religion and superstition.) My guess is that the author had some mystifying experience and decided to exaggerate it in the hope of having a best-seller. Unless you're hopelessly credulous, do not buy this book. If you are hopelessly credulous, you might enjoy my book about the year I spent living on Pluto.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|I LOVE the American pie series. True this movie is nothing like the first and second but these movies just hit home. American pie came out when I was in high school, the second movie based when they were in college came out when I was in college. You get the idea. I feel like I grew up with these movies and characters. My boyfriend was completely shocked when he learned after being with me for four years that I love this series because I typically don't like raunchy movies but this series has so much more depth and sweetness besides the crude scenes. This movie and the songs brought back the 90's and my high school life. The comment about the spice girls being \\"classic rock\\" particulary hit home for me. I was recently at a party when a great song came on that a young teenager referred to as \\"old school\\", so I got that scene.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Held my attention. Surprise ending. Never would have guessed it. I would recommend to anyone who likes mysteries with a twist.

098555780X|4.0|Not for the inexperienced. A video tutorial would be most useful to some, but I am very experienced in following written instruction/pictorials for a variety of project types, so I have no problem in working through each tie. I like it. thanks
0345803485|1.0|This is nothing more than fantasy porn for women, if that is what you are in to. I wanted to see what all the hype was about, was disappointed, and had to throw it in the garbage. Guess I could have sold it but the trash is really where it belongs.
B00AWBNNAG|1.0|Downloaded this for my son and it isn't working. When the app loads it is just a red background with ads appearing below it.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|This was a gift which I did not open.  Have not heard if all was ok, but I assume it was just as expected Or I would have heard something!  Thank you!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Why did he write an ending like that, we will all buy your next book because of your fantastic talent. Now you have became one of those cheap writers that writes for money and not passion.
1616614609|4.0|Netrunner is a very fun, complex card game. You can find out all about it from many sources, so I'm not going to reiterate the basics. There are a few points I would make for anyone thinking of buying this game.<br /><br />-The expansions are cheap but very fun if you're serious. Only the first expansion is really vital (What Lies Ahead) as it gives the corp factions some much needed agenda cards. Beyond that none are necessary.<br /><br />-It's a hard game to teach. There are a lot of rules, a lot of strategy, and once you master the basics then you add in the complexity of building your own deck. You'll need friends who are serious gaming to find good opponents.<br /><br />-To offset the last point, there is a way to play this game over the net through the OCTGN. If you like the game but can't find enough opponents, a few google searches will set you up with a platform to play the game online.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this game five stars is because it's a hard game to find opponents for locally unless you are part of a big tabletop gaming scene already. If you don't have access to that, the online OCTGN platform is great, but getting it up and running is a chore. So while the game itself is fantastic, the difficulty in playing it regularly keeps it from being perfect.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|I have always been a huge LOTR fan and when I heard the Hobbit was coming out I HAD to see it! I have to say they did an awesome job with The Unexpected Journey! I loved the fact we see Frodo (while Old Bilbo is writing/flashbacking in a way) It was flippin awesome to have seen Radagast the Brown! I gotta say I replayed the movie over and over, I never get bored watching this movie! Cant wait for The Desolation of Smaug this fall! Until then I will be watching the Hobbit. :)
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is a great book, and I love this series! James Dashner is an amazing author. The book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you become attached to the characters. My favorite series.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I'm not going to comment on the plot or the writing, because lots of other reviewers have already done that.  All I want to say is that if you are an avid reader and a lover of books, this will totally float your boat.  I read it when it first came out a few years ago, and it claimed a spot on my top 10 list of favorite books of all time--right up there with Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.  Highly recommended.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|An absolute rip off to get a fraction of the game for $3 without telling you upfront.  Then you have to buy in-game purchases to advance.  Plus, they do this since kids will buy the in-game stuff and the parents get an unexpected bill.  This is an absolute scam and this will be the last Angry Birds game we ever buy.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Energetic, exotic, and smooth lyrics. I recommend buyingvthis album, her voice is a stream of pleasure to listen, dance and live.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|So much fun. cannot stop playing. I pick up this game and play whenever I get a free minute.  Try it.<br /><br />Absolutely a great game.  When I get few minutes of free time I play this game.<br /> Everyone should try it at least one time
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it and my FAMILY loves it so much! I can't stop playing it! When I get off the bus I get my Ipod and play IT!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I see what all the fuss is about! I like how the books are not about teen anst and issues but about a corrupt government and rebellion. It's a good read!
B0091REZMW|5.0|i really enjoyed this game and play it everyday i recommend it the only thing i dont like is how much money you gotta spend on it very addicting
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Good set that will shine in your home theater set up. Yes the first one is the best, and then 2 & 3 are ok. Glad that all 3 had digital copy's and not just 2 & 3
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am hopelessly addicted to this game and I am only in the first week of it!. Lots of options, with little need to actually buy more power or items of the like. The scenes are well-drawn, the play is fast but not so much that these ols eyes can't figure out where objects are! You can also stop at any point for a break. I would give it five stars but am still trying to figure out many of the more complecated moves -- working with friends, getting rid of the little guys roaming around the edge of the board. Perhaps its because I just started!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A gripping story written in a unique way. The last 30 pages or so lost a bit of the thrilling momentum the rest of the book entails, but still an awesome read! Highly recommend!
B00190N4E4|5.0|Sir Ben Kingsley was really amazing by his portrayal of Gandhi.  I finished the movie feeling naive for my previous ignorance of his life and wiser for watching it.  Definitely worth an evening or two to appreciate his contribution on India's independence.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|In this so called \\"age of reason\\" it is alarming to know how many people are still grasped and directed by encient myth and ferry-tales, and scarry that they are willing to kill and be killed over these ridiculous ideas.<br />Sam Harris looks religion in the eye and shows how backwards, terrorizing and out right scary the notion of imaginary friend can be.<br />A must read!

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I'm so addicted to this game. I love Bingo and Bingo Blitz gives me the rush that I need.. I just wished I could get more credits and lower the collection time. Also make the games not so hard where its not too hard to complete some of the rooms especially the special rooms. I have no problems with this game on my kindle fire.
0307887898|1.0|I puchased this book seeing 4.5 stars rating on Amazon but was very disappointed when I started listening the audio version. I tried very hard to try to get to what the author was trying to portray. It's kind of vague because the contents of the book are lacking proper planning for presentation. I could not make heads or tails out of this book. Not worth spending the money and time in reading it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|We love have the calculater as big as the kindle fire. The screen is very easy to read. The calculater is also easy to use. I use it on a daily basis

B0099114WO|2.0|This film held my interest to the end, and from time to time, I felt deeply moved by the performances of Streep, Jones, and Carell, however, I felt like every song in the soundtrack beat me over the head with what the players were acting out. When I hear these songs on the radio, I like them, but in the context of this film - barf.  Fortunately for me, I watched this film on my computer, so I could mute the sound during each song and just watch the players communicate the story.  If I had gone to the cinema to see this film, I would have walked out before the end of the first act and missed the players sensitive performances.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|While suspenseful in sections and with a constantly twisting plot, the main characters are not likeable and you become even more estranged from them as the novel progresses.
0385344228|4.0|My new year resolution has been to start reading books. Started off with 50 shades and had to stop it half way thru, not because I do not like the bdsm related theme, but it was presented more from a girl's point of view, which I cannot understand sometimes.<br />Then started off with Defending Jacob. Since I have always liked john Grisham's court room centric novels, it sounded like a safe bet. I didn't know DJ was going to be at a totally different level. It is deep, moving, riveting, engaging and more importantly made you to ask What if it were my son, what would I do? It is about, good vs evil, about science, about family, about love, about father-son relationship and of course mother-son relationship.<br />Though I never write reviews, this novel has made me to, in the hope someone might find it useful and give it a try.<br />I am glad my new year resolution is off to a good start with this novel.<br /><br />Any good recommendations out there (in the crime/thriller category)?
B003QSLW0K|5.0|We love this movie.  Our girls are 4 and 5.  We also live in Hawaii, so it is fun to see all the familiar sites.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|After hearing this song I have never been more excited for an album release. I love how simple yet effective this track is. Classic daft punk vocals come in later with a great melody over top. Great song with pharrell and I look forward to the rest of the tracks next month!
0064431789|5.0|This  book is a classic from Maurice Sendak. I loved when my mom and I read it together when I was a little shaver. The illustrations are just terrific! You will find your child will ask you to read it to him/her over and again. Btw,' in the night kitchen'  is another great book from Sendak . Treat your little ones and pick it up . The price makes it a no brainer.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|This movie is gorgeous to watch, and some folks will adore it for that reason. My husband and I never made it through to the end, however, because we were hoping for a more traditional movie that we could &#34;lose ourselves&#34; in.  It's impossible to suspend your disbelief while watching this movie, because you are constantly reminded that you are watching a movie.  By showing the stage and constantly bringing in visual reminders of the artifice, the movie becomes very &#34;arty,&#34; but you will never forget that you're on the couch watching a contrivance.  As someone who loves to lose myself in a movie, I found this venue disconcerting.  We stuck through as long as we did because it was so addictively stylized and gorgeous, like visual candy.  I realized that my attraction to it was more like gaping at a well-produced MTV music video than loving it as a story-movie.  We turned it off after just under an hour.  But it was an hour of beautiful scenery for those who like eye-sugar.
6305313687|5.0|I love this movie because it shows how people can become a product of their enviroment, yet change when they realize that everything that they've been led to believe is a giant lie. Who better to prove this point but the anti-star, Edward Norton.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This was a delightful movie in so many ways. I loved everything from the almost surreal \\"colorization\\" of the film quality to the quirky characters and the hilarious reminders of what life was like growing up in the 1960s.  (unsupervised childhoods, the way professions that required uniforms (\\"Social Services\\") always included a pillbox hat, etc.)  I loved the character development and the subtle humor (references to \\"Sunday-school shoes\\" and \\"lefty-scissors\\").  The Bruce Willis character of the island policeman and the Scout Leader are both especially well developed. I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it three times.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I reserve that hallowed rating for my lifetime favorite movies, and this movie was not deep enough for that.  But this is a fun and extremely enjoyable movie -- at least for Baby Boomers like myself who enjoy remembering how our childhoods were very free in some ways -- we jumped off of roofs onto trampolines with no net and no supervision, and we never had pre-arranged \\"play-dates,\\" and yet we lived under the threat of things like the uniformed Miss \\"Social Services,\\" who loomed in the Orwellian background of Cold War childhoods.  When you watch this movie, you will both chuckle at the accurate capture of the 1960s and sigh for the loss of that world with its goofy innocence.
B001I8A76A|4.0|I love her work and have not been disappointed yet. She's always done wonderfully at setting real life to music. Hope she's around for a long time to com.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I can't wait to see the movie. If it's half as good as this book, it's got to be worth seeing. Very realistic depiction of the struggles of mental illness. Everyone should read it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a good version of this story. It is well acted and has a lot of stars in it. There are beautiful sets and clothes. The movie moves well and does not drag, and it is not silly like old versions. I have several versions of this story and I watch this one the most.
