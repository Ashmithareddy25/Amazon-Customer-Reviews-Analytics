B006C45CFG|3.0|the title should have warned me off.  Cowboys and Aliens what was i thinking.  I like everyone in the cast and i thought they could pull it off, but i was wrong
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|We enjoyed this movie because of the action,suspense, adventure, and spy intrigue. Children should be13 or 14 at least. Otherwise, a nice family event.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|What more is there to say.  the kids liked it and i almost got a nap.  they enjoyed the story and were laugh just enough to keep me from falling asleep.
B0026QC0YU|4.0|It was fun to go back in time and see the first Mission Impossible movie. It was like deja-vu. Good family viewing for the history of the series.
B001LM1456|4.0|this was definately a better remake.  Ed nortin did a great job with this adaptation.  Would like to have seen him do more
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|great movie, enjoy more every time we watch it, good for all ages and stages, we show in our dental office, love it!
B005TBN3EU|4.0|This was funny, a little rehashing the same stuff, but funny still.  But Chang and the strip club, was just wrong on too many levels to describe.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|great movie, enjoy more every time we watch it, good for all ages and stages, we show in our dental office, love it!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I had been hearing about the walking dead from my family.  I finally started watching and wow.  I was hooked from the start.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I've waited so long for this book to be completed.  As some have said it didn't answer all the questions.  However as the author says, the wheel continues to turn.  Quite surprising end.  It makes you wish for a continuation of the saga.  Overall a real page turner.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story of these books is very interesting.  My wife read them 1st as said that she enjoyed them.  I had ulterior motives if you know what i mean...and my plan worked.  So i read them for pointers.  Next thing you know is was done with the book and the whole series.  There is sexual action, but it is not trashy.  I found that i was intrigued by the plot and the sex at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfers because it is a handy game whenever I get bored I always go on this game because it is really addictive.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I had been hearing about the walking dead from my family.  I finally started watching and wow.  I was hooked from the start.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Too bad they didn't follow the storyline better , it's ok but. The movie had some great actors who had some mundane dialog. The chase scene was good .Then the movie slowed to a crawl. I would save my cash and pass this one up.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Like the graphics, good challenge!  I compete against my best time and play it all the time while waiting or just to kill time!
B006M4F67A|5.0|No frills straight ahead mahjong.The way the game is supposed to be played, nice and relaxing.I recommend it for all ages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app for free how?<br />just go to 4shared.com and make an account then type in minecraft click on the link (should be the first one) then wait 20sec and the click download and enjoy! FOR FREE!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the character development to the story arch this story is top notch. It will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat through the entire read.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|I love this CD and listen to it all the time, came quicly and have no complaints at all here.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Chest busters, Colonial Marines, corporate intruige and zenomorphs having unprotected sex with anyone they can find. That's a bad thing right?
B000MXPE74|5.0|I love this CD and listen to it all the time, came quicly and have no complaints at all here.
B0041KKYDI|3.0|It could have been better.  I thought it would be.  So I was a bit disappointed in the length of the movie and it just seemed to fly by.<br />I bought mine used and glad I did.
B000E1155E|5.0|I love this CD and listen to it all the time, came quicly and have no complaints at all here.
B00499NHLC|5.0|How splendidly Sherlock and Watson were brought into modern day England. Blogs, computers, cell phones and criminals witn a modern twist. The old British resolve is kept intact no matter what is happening. Benedict Cumberbatch is a perfect Sherlock. Smiles are few and far between. His brain is always working, and he has to be physically fit as well. Martin Freeman is Watson. His face is so expressive he need not clutter a moment with words.<br />The stories chosen for season one are classic. But with a twist. Always a twist. With a wink and a smirk the nemeses comes on the scene....a gem for Sherlock Holmes fans to enjoy. Superb writing. Superb acting. Exciting and you are invested in the characters at once. All this and a cliff hanger ending to keep us waiting for season two.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is much better than the previews would have you believe.  Starts a bit slow while building the storyline; but entertaining all the while. Much of the humor is based on classic video games; those that grew up with these will understand and laugh. It made me want to find an old Intelevision or Atari system. lol
B0081336FO|5.0|If you liked season one, season two will knock your viewing socks off. The writers should be given awards and lots of money to keep this series going. Season two starts with a classic good vs evil and ends with our collective hearts in our throats. The stories, once again classic, are modernized. This is no easy thing to do properly. And yet it is done, not only properly, but with a superb view to keeping the Sherlock character intact in a world of trash press, television, cell phones, town cars and villains with vast amounts of money. Baker Street is intact, Mrs. Hudson is long suffering and has much to mutter about, so is perfect. The Season 2 cliff hanger is....shocking, heartbreaking, exciting and makes the wait for Season 3 seem even longer.
0786956291|5.0|First of all, this red box is currently &lt; $15 on Amazon, so with that in mind, this is an excellent deal to get started with D&D (specifically with 4e). In 4e, WOTC tried to bring back some memories of the original Red Boxes, but this box is entirely geared to give you everything to get started. The player's book does a good job of getting one up to speed with the essential characters/classes and then the DM book along with the mini cutouts and map take you through an adventure that is actually worth playing. Furthermore, this adventure ties right into the Nentir Vale which is the default D&D setting.<br /><br />Most importantly, this box gives you (and a few friends) enough material to thoroughly enjoy and acclimate to D&D 4e, well enough that if you are going to like it, then I think you'll know soon enough and then be able to make an informed decision to go ahead and buy the much more expensive core books (at this time probably costs $80-$90 for a Player's Handbook 1, DM Guide 1 which does include an adventure, and Monster Manual 1).<br /><br />One last thing, I can easily see that this box could be well understood by ~12 years and up without the need of an adult to guide them. My 8 and 9 year old girls on the other hand definitely need an adult to guide through the game and rules (and dumb down the rules even further). I'm not quite sure what ages the box says it's geared for (probably 12 or 13 and up?)
B0060FXBNM|5.0|And I'm super thrilled to get them all on BluRay for an amazing price. The set is already open and on my shelf, after several viewings.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Very good film. The history of sound city, and the artists that recorded there is full of ups and downs and great music.
B003QS9TKU|5.0|Maybe for older kids. I remember watching this as a kid and loving the songs and end battle scene with the magic. The WWII setting and backdrop seems more suited to kids that have heard of it.
B00AWQEKIK|4.0|For the most part an excellent retrospective. I do think there was a little too much filler. 3 discs might have been better.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great length for charging your phone next to your bed. Not quite as long as I'd like but it works.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It is as good as the description. There are so many versions that it will take more than 24.7 to play them all.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|JT continues to put out high quality music. Not much of a &#34;pop&#34; music fan but really enjoy the album and continue to be impressed with the new music from JT.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|For a new user it is pretty intuitive. Simple to use and the pics come out nice. I have only just started to explore all the features so I may increase or decrease my rating once I have gotten more experience.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I saw it coming with the way book 12 ended. Then I thought well, maybe that was just a tease and things would turn around and I'd be pleasantly surprised with this book. Nope. I am so mad right now, if I bought the book instead of the kindle edition, I'd throw it out the window. I am still having a hard time believing that Charlaine Harris could let me down like that. The storyline in general was a bit hard to follow. The way many things ended was very disappointing. The ending was the worst. I thought about buying the book After Dead when it comes out in October but, why rub salt in the wound?
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Works better than others but really hard to maneuver and it gets goofy in the middle of use. Frustrating.<br /><br />Can't view any videos.
B00BSJ2YVA|5.0|Their self-titled 2012 debut was a solid riff driven monster full of doom drenched hard driven rock and the follow-up \\"Abra Kadavar \\" is just as intense. If you yearn for the glory days of Sabbath with psychedelic  space driven Hawkwind undertones this is the band for you.<br /><br />\\"Warm, intense, authentic , doubtlessly a gift from bygone times,\\" Kadavar's been elevated to one of today's most sought after and exciting acts. The Berlin trio, have worked quickly to become one of the most prominent acts in the European heavy underground with their growing fan base starving for more material. This new release has us entering the realms of \\"Abra Kadavar\\" , down-to-earth handmade classic rock from a time when music still used to be true art!<br /><br />I read...<br />\\"What gives a record personality and distinguishes it from multitude of releases that are thrown out by labels on a daily basis is not something that can be easily put into words. It can be attributed to the magic that exists between the musicians, but it can also come from the warmth of a certain guitar tone, or even a vocal that, while not technically in tune, hits a nerve inside the listener.\\"<br /><br />The band is...<br />Lupus Lindemann ...Vocals/ Guitar<br />Mammut ...Bass<br />Tiger ...Drums<br /><br />The song \\"Doomsday Machine\\" best showcases the band's trademark sound, taking us back to the origins of metal. Between changes in tempo, single note riffs and guitar solos, the lyrical concept deals with destruction - inspired by Stanley Kubrick's movie `Dr. Strangelove'...Sabbath drenched through and through...I love it!<br /><br />\\"Dust\\" and \\"Fire\\" also captivate in the way that only `70s Sabbath could. This is not about reinvention, this is reinterpreting the masters--and few bands are this convincing.<br /><br />\\"Abra Kadavar is confirmation of their prowess and a signal that there's more to them than analog worship and thick grooves. One of several factors it shares in common with Kadavar's preceding outing, however, is that Abra Kadavar is still loaded with potential for what this band might be able to accomplish.\\"...The Obelisk<br /><br />Tiger states...\\"The songs are more diversified, the ideas feel more spontaneous. Moreover, we've tried to capture much more of our live energy, which is why we've recorded almost everything all together in one room, with the amps turned up to the max - solely the vocals and a handful of guitar solos were added afterwards.\\"<br /><br />If you think that traditional 60's/70's rock has blown its wad then you haven't heard Kadavar.  Drummer Tiger says: \\"We sat down for two weeks straight to finish composing with total commitment. We're perfectly happy with the outcome - I'd even say that it comprises the best compositions we've created to date.\\"<br /><br />I'm in total agreement,  tune in and trip out on their \\"Liquid Dream\\",  5 stars easily.ceding outing, however, is that Abra Kadavar is still loaded with potential for what this band might be able to accomplish.\\"...The Obelisk<br /><br />Tiger states...\\"The songs are more diversified, the ideas feel more spontaneous.

B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best the best ever and I will give it 5stars. Get it. Get it now get it now.
B00BBSM5X0|5.0|I love this type of animation. I went searching for this version after reading a review on another site explaining how the Disney company took out the ecological parts and made it a &#34;good guy vs. bad guy&#34; presentation. It was worth the search. My husband and I enjoy movies in the language from the country they are produced in. We don't mind reading subtitles. Some of the other movies from Studio Ghibli include Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Ponyo and Howl's Moving Castle. All are great movies. Some you can only find with dubbed English, some only in Japanese with English subtitles. The version I bought was from Thailand in Japanese or Thai with english subtitles. I highly recommend any from this studio.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|The app is unusable now.Twitch is on revision 1.05 of thrir Android app now. The only one available on Amazon is v1.03. It won't load streams in 1.03 anymore. This app is a waste of space now.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Richard Castle, though fictitious, writes a story that takes you in from the very first sentence. I loved the plot, and I kept thinking about Castle and Beckett throughout. He really is ruggedly handsome.
B009X01C64|5.0|This is a very high quality case that makes using the Kindle HD much easier. It is very well constructed using genuine leather and allows the user to place the Kindle HD in whichever position is comfortable for them.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|After a 36+year career as a family law attorney, the attempt by the grandparents to slander the father so they could have custody is all too familiar and infuriating.  I read the book in 2 sittings because I was impatient to see the grandparents get their comeuppance.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I absolutely loved Delirium. So much that I couldn't wait until the second book came out and then the third book came out. But, neither of the second two could compare to the first. In this book, we get loose ends tied up. What I did enjoy about the book is that it portrayed the full scope of why love is difficult, or at least why it can be difficult. I think that helped aid the basis of the trilogy and specifically this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it.. so real. Am ready to continue with this story! I read this one quickly, loved the pace of the writing
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this kind of show.  Good story line.  Fun, interesting, varied characters.  Good morals.  Wholesome. Learn about history too.  Wish there were more like this.  LC
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I reread this book annually, and never fail to fall in love with the characters.  I have been reading it annually for more than twenty years and it never loses its impact.  A must read for any horror enthusiast!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love all the songs on the CD!  &#34;Song of the Caged Bird&#34; is my favorite of all.  She's amazing!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know many a friend who has read this book, but I have had it quite some time and find it boring, no real story line and have not been able to get into the book at all.  Poor read, characters are shallow and mundane.  Typical find the sex part and read, storyline is lost.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Well...I'm not sure anything needs to be said.  Star Trek is 5 stars because it is!  I realize that isn't very helpful, but honestly, if you haven't watched Star Trek (where have you been), you should.  If you don't like Star Trek, umm, no comment.  Seriously, if this really is new to you, I'd definitely recommend this set.  I'd start with movie II, The Wrath of Khan - ties in with the original television series, including Montalban planning Khan - so awesome!!  The first movie is great (to this die hard Trekkie), but it moves at a slower pace, so might be better to watch out of order.  I was thrilled to find this set reasonably priced on Amazon - to replace my worn out VHS versions - yea!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Unfortunately we had to return the entire set, since we received two copies as birthday gift, however the DVD's are great.<br />return policy is AWESOME
B00000JZI9|5.0|This is definitely one of my top 10 movies of all time.  Interestingly, I'm not a big &#34;westerns&#34; fan.  The mix of a terrific story, comedy and drama, heroes and villains, tragedy and triumph, all melds together to make great entertainment!  The four main stars do an amazing job bringing their characters to life (it's my favorite Kevin Costner role ever); and supporting actors are terrific too, Brian Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Jeff Fahey, John Cleese, Jeff Goldblum, Rosanna Arquette, etc.  The cast is just stellar!  So fun to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price, to own and introduce to my kids!  Now I can finally retire my VHS copy. =)
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Unfortunately we had to return the entire set, since we received two copies as birthday gift, however the DVD's are great
B0050KEVO6|5.0|It is really fun. There are a little over 300 possibilities to combine to make a new one and I think I am at about half. It is fun trying various combos in attempt to find a new one. You have to play to understand what I am saying.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Unfortunately we had to return the entire set, since we received two copies as birthday gift, however the DVD's are great.<br />return poliy is AWESOME
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Not great, not bad - just fine! It covers the Kindle and is pretty - LOL. The part that folds and acts as a stand is flimsy just a bit. I use it in bed so it is not sitting on a flat surface - maybe on a flat surface it might work better.
B007REV4YI|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!<br /><br />THE BEST 007 OF ALL SO FAR RELEASED. SORRY FOR M DEATH.<br />LOOG FORWARD FOR NEW EPISODE, WHEN IT COME.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a game that contains new updates, cool characters, and new hoverboards. I think that subway surfers does not contain any inappropriate things. I hope that this review helps make a choice of getting this app or not. Thank you!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love search and find games and this one is my favorite. It's really fun and challenging. It may not seem like it in the beginning, but as the game progresses, you unlock a ton of new areas (the yard, basement, space ship, etc).  You don't have to pay to play the game, but this requires a lot of patience. The only negative is that sometimes  the game will not load properly (on a kindle) and sometimes you have to force stop it to get it to work. However once it loads it doesn't freeze up any more. If they fix this problem then this game is worthy of five stars.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Lovely written characters personify day to day issues of life, and although it's set in time before the Industrial Age, it's a beautiful reminder of the benefits of community, the bond of man/woman and nature, and the day to day struggle of living with the values we know to be good while coming to terms with our human weaknesses.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|A great, sharp, clean blu ray movie that trumps the DvD version. Perfect in every way. Bale before he was the Bat.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|I've never tried using one in real life, however I might be willing to fly one after some more hours using this.<br />Crashing doesn't hurt any thing, just reset. Adding wind and other factors makes it more real.<br /><br />We have a large club near me and it is fascinating to watch these planes fly.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|I waited to see this block buster and all it was Was interesting. Classical kung fu story line with great martial arts. Lung tu collector Catch this one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This story is narrated by a teen boy, yet I truly felt as though I could relate to it. High school is a weird time for anybody, and it was interesting to see the situations Charlie is presented with and how he handles them. I hate to sound cliche, but this is truly a classic coming of age story. This is something that should be required reading in high school nowadays.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|You can find hidden gems on this app. Many artist post their videos to see if people like them here. Also great entertainment if you have a yoking.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was another book that was recommended by a friend, and though I wasn't quite sure how I would like it, I figured I could always stop reading if I really couldn't get into it.<br /><br />Basically, a young man grows up listening to his grandfather's stories, most of which contain elements that cause them to sound made-up...only, the young man happens to stumble across the very people in the stories through a weird twist of fate.<br /><br />This story is billed as a young adult book..but I can honestly say that it was just as interesting to this adult!
B003K16P50|5.0|Enjoyable reading.  I loved all the characters,  You really felt like you knew them.  Although my only disappointment was that the king died in the end.  I loved him....
B0010X745K|5.0|GREAT MOVIE TYPICAL STEVE KING MOVIE.. THE ENDING SUCKS BUT ITS A GOOD MOVIE NOTHING MAJOR HAPPENS IN IT BUT ITS A JOY TO WATCH
B006M4F67A|1.0|Installed it on my HTC running android 4.0.4. It resulted in reboot of the phone when starting the game. I tried it once more after reboot, the same thing happened again. Finally, removed it from my phone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I figured it out in the middle. But very good tale. I enjoyed this book. It's a great read. Good plot
B009FZHYKU|5.0|they need to make a movie to but a great show though cant wait for more to come out !
B0094BB4TW|4.0|So far I'm satisfied. Should renamed app OFFICIAL FACEBOOK APP. I was stuck with inferior app/shortcut because I thought it was the only FB app out there
B0064MGU98|4.0|Worth some escapist watching.  Unrealistic perpetual &#34;wins&#34; and Hail Mary saves for main character that get a bit tiresome. Some fun characters that you love to hate.
0812550706|2.0|Does this book need another review? Oh well, I'm doing it anyways.<br /><br />I heard many great reviews of this book and was recommend the series by avid Sci-Fi readers. I read one sci-fi book prior to this one, and had been complaining that the story was great and the writing was compelling, but there was no satisfaction with the ending. Theories and explanations were just thrown in at the end to tie up story lines. So, they all said..you have to read this series \\"the writing is so good, the story is fantastic, and it explains everything really well.\\"<br /><br />Well, I didn't buy the whole series thank goodness. As many other reviewers have already given a synopsis of the book, I'll spare you from that.<br /><br />Here is what I didn't like.<br />The writing! There was nothing in the writing the griped me or made me feel part of the story or connected to the characters. There were plenty of action scenes but it all read monotone. I love it when a book can keep you hooked with each chapter and make you want to finish the book that night. This book dragged on for weeks. There was no motivation to finish besides the fact that I've finished every book I've started. I kept looking through to see how much more I had left of each chapter just so I could be done with the darn thing. You could skip paragraphs and even some chapters and still be fine understanding what's going on. That's how uneventful the scenes are.<br /><br />It's a sci-fi book, so I wasn't expecting plausibility or anything realistic. I was okay with the warriors being children. I thought there was quite a bit of science fiction elements in it, considering most of the book is set in a battle room that has 0 gravity and then there are the simulators and other games. I just don't like the writing style. I'm even okay with the subplot of the siblings, even though it isn't all that exciting. It seems to be the most character development in the whole story. Most of the book seemed to be about battles with other teams and for me, I want the author to describe it all so it feels like I'm in the battle too. The way it's written now makes me feel like I'm reading about the highlights from a writer who wasn't at the game himself. Clearly not everyone wants this kind of writing, but I prefer it.
1595828753|5.0|I'm a bit of an AtLA freak, so anything related to it you can bet I'm going to buy. I like seeing more of the events that happened after the Hundred Year War, some of which shaped the things that happened in Korra.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|really enjoyed this movie back in the day...it spoke to me as few movies can...you'll enjoy watching this classic movie...
B001MS7IBS|5.0|I owned it on DVD but its no match to this Bluray release. Nothing beats watching one of the best series in high def. Maybe the only downside is the audio. No DolbyTrueHD or DTS-HD encoding on this release. But its still good. Highly recommended.
B00000DFSK|3.0|Not my thing, it'll be used as a door stop, works pretty well on light doors, high friction quotient on hard floors.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Ads and in app purchases. Controls are also terrible on a galaxy nexus but no stars deducted for that. Better on a tablet but even better with a different game that doesn't have in app purchases in a paid game
B000002VMD|5.0|Whitney's life style a detraction but her talent unmistakable, its value with the help of the industry destroyed her, so sad!
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Like other Sookie stackhouse fans, I was looking forward to reading this last book. You pretty much had figured out from the previous book who she would end up with. The man she ended up with was a good match for her but borring too. I liked that she tried to tie up every character stories but some of their endings were just unsatisfactory. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the story, stayed up all night to finish it but I expected more considering how many years we as readers have been invested in these characters lives
B00005QGAZ|3.0|Michael was never top of my list, thought I'd keep a cd as a keep sake, doubt it'll be played much, another poor soul lost by fame and fortune, his family still buying into the industries professional butt kissing mongers.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This has got to be one of the top 10 Sci-Fi shows ever. The cast is great and witty. Too bad it was cancelled!
B002VECM6S|5.0|A heart warming story well worth your time, we rush through life often missing its most important features, and it has my all time favorite football coach in it Phillip Fulmer!
B009R659L8|5.0|Like all Mary Higgins Clark books, this one is full of suspense with a surprise twist to blow your mind.  Excellent can't-put-it-down read.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Lots of blood, lots of killings, good story line, typical Tarantino. Not for kids that's for sure.<br />If you get a chance watch this movie, and if the &#34;N&#34; word offends you pass it by.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|my nephew downloaded this game He played around with it for a while but I felt the image a bit too weird to tolerate it.  a cyber pet.. Hell no.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Nice idea for a game.  You start with you, a spouse (who does nothing, lol), and a wagon, and a little narrative starts you off.  I've only been playing for a few days, but it is pretty fun.  I made some mistakes early on, so I started over yesterday. Tip: don't spend your cash if you don't intend to invest any money in the game.  Some of my favorite parts of the Oregon Trail games were there, including illness and injury.  There are different levels and opportunities to grow a nice little town.<br /><br />People have complained about the amount of wait time.  Yes, you have to wait a bit,  but if you leave the game alone for an hour or so (and read, do chores, whatever), your energy will be back up again and you can play for a couple of minutes and then go back to real life.  That's one of the things I like most about it- I can't spend hours and hours playing it and doing nothing else, so it's less guilt than other games.<br /><br />My big complaint about the game is that the battery suck seems to be tremendous.  I make it a point to play only when my Kindle is plugged in- otherwise I get irritated by the dwindling amount and I want to delete the game.

B00CL6HGIK|3.0|It's all in the Big Apple again. Hollywood spits out another tired old version of the same story we've seen over and over again. A corrupt mayor. His wife is having an affair. An excop is hired to track down the mystery lover....everyone in a double cross. Wahlberg's performance is up to standard. Russel Crowe sounds like an Australian one sentence, an American the next. This will entertain you. It's well produced. It's just too familiar. Would be a good second feature on a two film night on the sofa. One cool thing, the wife has an affair with an African American. You go girl.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|The author manages to keep things beautifully romantic and practical .<br />It's a bitter sweet story about loss , hope and above all love
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This weather app gives me all I want to know, when I want to know it, in a quick concise manner. If you have an outdoor life often ruled by the weather, you won't go wrong with this app.
B009FZFONO|4.0|But we are getting towards the end and really looking forward to the final showdown that is imminent.  If you are a fan of serial shows, you know how hard it is for them to keep the ideas fresh and going year after year.  Season 3 hits it stride, for sure.
B0095P29EG|4.0|movie took me back to my comic book days and brought to life the character i remember as a kid
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|love this app so amazing you should really buy it now. so stop. reading this go go buy it you
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Pretty cool game....really like the two dimensional aspect of it.  Enjoy playing it on my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend it.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|This book was pretty good overall. The story was interesting and left you wondering how it all would end which is rare in fantasy books. I'd say the only negative is that it tends to jump around a bit telling the back story of the main character and his group of &#34;Gentleman Bastards&#34;. Overall I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a slower paced book that still delivers on action and keeps the reader guessing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The first season was so good I looked forward to season 2 and it did not disappoint. I have since also purchased season 3!
098555780X|5.0|This book shows a lot of knots and ways to make several items with the paracord.  It taught me some new knots and gave ideas of things to make with the paracord.
B003EY7IRC|1.0|This is just not my cup of tea. I did not read the whole book and I don't enjoy the genre.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|great for when you have downtime<br /> keeps you busy. love the colors of the plants and the exotic fish. they have lots of options.
B00CIU3IVS|4.0|The only reason I'm not putting 5 Stars/&#34;I love it&#34;, is that everyone around me has been playing the music since the week before the soundtrack dropped - so some of the Wow-Factor was taken out of it by the fact that 3 days after the movie opened I'm feeling like it's already being over-played.<br /><br />I do still love it though!<br />The funky beats are pretty unreal.  As a fan of Swing music since its heyday in the late 90's I am so intriqued by the fun textures that are woven into each track.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|I bought this DVD. It is pretty good and I am very pleased with the purchase. I will definitely recommend this product.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  It was dramatic and funny.  Jennifer, Brad, Chris, Robert were all Oscar worthy.  I would watch it again and again.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging with awesome graphics. Well worth the money! Hope all their games are as good as this one. I will definitely look for more games following this one.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|The Great Gatsby is a novel that has famously failed to cross into other mediums. With this latest adaptation, by director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge), I was curious to see how Luhrmann's unique style would translate to this classic story. I entered the theater with a fair amount of trepidation, especially after the largely mixed reviews that I'd read. To my surprise, however, I really enjoyed this adaptation.<br /><br />There were a couple of major alterations to the novel's original story, namely Nick's background and the events that take place after his time with Gatsby, but the film was mostly faithful to the novel. Many of the reviews argued against the director's style over substance approach, but I completely disagree with these claims. While there are moments of dazzling camera acrobatics and 3D effects, there are also many moments of quiet introspection. DiCaprio's Gatsby is probably the most sincere portrayal of this character that will ever appear on film. His interactions with both Maguire's Nick and Mulligan's Daisy seemed genuine, and I could really feel the soul of the man behind the facade he had made for himself.<br /><br />This Unique interpretation will, no doubt, garner a variety of reactions amongst the faithful readers and casual moviegoers. In the end, it is probably impossible to perfectly translate the intentions of the novel into a film, but this one comes pretty close.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|One of the best films in the last 20 years.<br />Delightful and extraordinary and hysterically funny writing on an historical figure and era.  Incredible acting, great casting.  Sets and production design so meticulously true to the period.  I can watch it over and over and never tire of seeing it.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I got this for my 9 year granddaughter and she loves it....has watched daily since she received it....love love loves it!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love this game, I play it all the time.  Some people say it is stressful, but to me it is relaxing. Love it!  Love it !  Love it !
1572814349|4.0|The design of the product is very beautiful, i cant help but to look at it everyday. The cards are carefully worked on and very interesting to admire. I recommend to any tarot collector, reader, or anyone who enjoys art objects! You just have to be very careful with the edges, if you accidentally scratch them the gold will come off easily, but besides that the cards are very stiff and the box protects them and the book very well.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My husband is addicted to this game. I think it's great because it allows him to freshen-up his chess skills. Right now the computer is kicking his butt....not for long though. Give this ap a try

B00AEBB8ZG|5.0|As a result of her ennui brought on by the monotonous pace of her daily work and a lonely life and a failed marriage, a grown-up woman manages to get stuck temporarily in the past  (her youth) through the art of writing novels for young. The film shows in a dark but  graceful way how this woman faces and sees the problematic of her life through being the main character of her young-adult novels.<br />I found an excellent approach to this kind of problematic, which is hardly found in films.
0545265355|5.0|Great books can't wait for the second movie. Story line is awesome but I don't like the way she writes that much.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book so much that i just want to reread it over again and I just couldn't hold back the tears
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is awesome. The graphics, sound and action blend so well. I also appreciate the options of choosing one of four class types.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I can't put this book down...I recommend it to all my friends...can't wait to start next book. It is good book.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Mahjong 247 has it all very good game all around, get's you coming back for more and enjoy every game played!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It is a very good game to play.  It was a little short but fun.  It makes you think about what to do next.
B007ZYJMU8|4.0|Wow - this was unexpected. Guess I should have read the reviews people wrote before watching...probably wouldn't have watched it.  (** two dogs are killed, a woman is abused and raped and there is other violence/abuse **)  As it was, I almost turned it off to watch something else but then realized I'd watched enough to be sucked in and wanted to see how it turned out because these two are supposed to see each other as their salvation, so I kept thinking it would get better...<br /><br />This is a gritty story of a very unlikable SOB drunken man with issues... one day he is drunk and mostly running from himself and ducks into some little (boutique?) run by a nice woman. She is scared but reaches out to him by praying out loud for him. Somehow they strike up a bit of a relationship. Then you find out that her (upper middle-class?) life isn't so peachy -- she is living a nightmare herself.<br /><br />One thing leads to another and though things are very \\"messy\\", they perhaps find in each other just what they need and it actually has kind of a surprise and then maybe a hopeful ending. If I didn't see it through to the very end, I would not have rated it this high - more likely I would have given it 2 stars. But to be honest, it was a bit hard to watch.<br /><br />I don't know anyone personally I'd recommend this to, it's a bit hard to watch. But read some other reviews and decide if you want to see this.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I can't even begin to explain how great this app is. You can meet new people, chat with them, and talk to people you already know.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Watched the Hunger Games with my kids. Was one of their favorites. Movie was more tame than the book which was necessary as everyone in Elementary School is familiar with the Hunger Games trilogy.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|When I got this  CD the first thing I did was play it, and right away I noticed it, the music sounded nowhere near as good as the original. It was still good, just not as good. I would recommend getting the original set if I were you.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Horror movies get too caught up in technology and ruin a good story. It was still a good movie, the effects kind of ruined it for me though.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I have enjoyed my kindle case. It makes reading and holding my kindle so much easier. It has also help protect the kindle and that is a plus all the way around.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|but a great premise and an easy read, I really enjoyed it. Sounds plausible even possible ... lots of good humor.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I do not use facebook much but it is nice to catch up with people that you don't see often by watching their pages.  Many school use facebook to keep parents and alumni informed and that is a plus for everyone.
B002W1UEW4|2.0|What do you expect with a name like GI Joe? I knew it was going to be juvenile, but didn't think it would be this bad.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Have just been introduced to this game by grandchildren and they enjoy it and it has rubbed off on me. Not always good at it but it takes up boring time in doctors offices and other slow period of time.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|I love this new cd! So much heart and soul in the songs! I have been a fan since my teen years and have loved it all but as I grow older this is my favorite so far! Still has the rock and roll edge to some of the songs but I love the ballads on this one
B00BIPMGD0|5.0|Season 3 contines the excellence found in this series. I found myself watching as many as 3 episodes per sitting.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We knew there was a chance we'd like this as we knew - and liked! - other work of the principal stars, so we thought we'd give it a try.  All I can say is WOW!  The entire cast is excellent.  The  interplay between Castle and Beckett is great!  She keeps him on his toes.  At first you might think Castle is perhaps a shallow character, but with each new episode you find new depths in him.  Beckett is more business like, but she has many layers and they're slowly revealed.  The absolute best part of this series, though, is the relationship between Castle and his daughter.  His love and commitment to her shines through.  This series has it all: comedy, drama, playfulness, action, and a sweetness you seldom find on TV these days.
B00CJVZB5W|4.0|Always like Rod Stewart and he hasn't mellowed with age. His new album (dated myself) will appeal yo young and old.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This game looked fun but was so boring and it needs a constant internet connection. I would not buy this again !
B00992CF6W|5.0|we love it. we love the mobs. it's very creative and you get to mine and survive ~ The Boy and The Deuce
B00BF11STU|4.0|If you liked the Hurt Locker, you won't be disappointed by this movie.  Characters are great and gives you a peek into the secret life of our government.
1451648537|5.0|This was a excellent book. I knew nothing about Steve Jobs or Apple. The book shows both sides of Jobs. It shows the good and the bad with his personnal blessing.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Its fine as far as it goes.  It only plays one level of puzzles and doesn't take long to get through the course.  However, it is relaxing and the sounds are pleasant.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Thoroughly entertaining, but like any Tarantino movie it is not for children. DiCaprio was amazing, but not quite as awesome as the cast members who had to immerse themselves into their roles as slaves.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I've worked on radio for many years and always have used AKG's. But I frequently find this Sony MDR7506 in Recording Studios. So I wanted to try them on my daily work. Not good for that. Perhaps for music listening but the sound for working on the mike is too bright. AKG's are still the best for that. In my opinion.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really enjoyed the free trial ,I want to play the full game.<br />The story line is very good along with the background music make`s this game come to life.<br /><br /> There is mystery, thrills and excitement in this game I would recommend this game to all those hidden object fans out there.

B004EF65QA|5.0|If you love movies like Pride and Prejudice, you'll love this series. I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in that type of genre. It's so good!!!!
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|stargate is always good  this one is a great example of the style and  as usual the best cast ever
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game to pass the time. Very addictive great adventures.  Does use a lot of memory and much easier to play on a table or ipad.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|One of the best things about Linkin Park is that they are not bound up and gagged, forced to keep doing the same thing they did before. This collection, and their later work, evolved along with their own perspectives. I enjoy seeing their ideas grow and move into new areas, in contrast to others who want the same old angst. Songs on this CD continue to show their strengths- synth, guitar, and Mike and Chester's trade offs between rap and musical vocals, though there is not so much of the rap as there was on Meteora and Hybrid Theory. It's a more thoughtful album and very enjoyable.
B0019GO5DC|4.0|If you like 80's movies of this nature - 16 candles, breakfast club, better off dead, etc.. you will probably like this one.
0823023494|5.0|I ended up buying this book, I don't know why maybe I have a thirst for knowledge. When I received it in the mail I thought, \\"Oh man why did I get another dumb drawing book that I'll never use?\\" But I sat down and flipped through the pages. I saw a lot of interesting things. So I started reading the introduction and the author makes a point. There are plenty of books that show you how to draw technically but not a lot of books that show you how to make your character unique. This is a one of a kind book.<br /><br />I read the book in a week and I loved it. It shows you the basics of character design and even has an assignment that runs through the book. You're given a description of some characters and your tasks is to draw him using some of the guidelines that are in the book. The book covers sizes, shapes, variations, creating kids, animals, monsters. It's a really good read, and better than what I was expecting.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|There are some really great aspects, beautiful aspects to this story and how it is written. It is so highly rated by a lot of people and honestly I just did not enjoy it as much as I expected considering that.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A good read.  It keep me guessing until the author brought it all altogether.<br /><br />  Real  Really good development of characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I normally don't go for these types of shows but once I got into this one I loved it. The perspective from the servants point of view is interesting. The characters are well developed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very good book with a wealth of insight as to the real &#34;I&#34;, who are we really. What is it that is more than meets the eye, basically the senses. Takes us to &#34;reality!&#34;
B00138EZLI|5.0|I love this song and I bought it to add to my music collection on my laptop. Thanks you Amazon!!
B0055PMURG|5.0|A great movie. What an inspiration to all. A lot is missing from the movie, but it was enough to get me to read it and the one from her mom.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|If you need a game to de-stress and just have a little fun, this game will fit the bill. If you leave game for a while, you get your hearts back without buying more.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a great game.  The graphics are beautiful, game play is smooth and it works great on my kindle fire.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|After I read the book I decidet to start running my self. It is an very inspiring book and it was interesting to read about the history of running.
B004132HZS|5.0|The series is an excellent adaptation of Sherlock, with enough nods to the original to satisfy diehards while bringing the right amount of tongue-in-cheek modernity to keep newbies interested.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is epic I love it, especially the free version. Super fun! Do buy this game. It's worth $200.00! They definitely could add to the cost. Don't read the other reviews, thry are lyying criticism.
B00992CF6W|5.0|even though its not like the computer I still like it because you can mostly create everything that's on the computer and its good for on the go.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I use this app to time my reading for school, and it works perfectly! 4 stars because I can never hear the alarm, and my mom wakes me up. Other than that, definite yes! Get this app!
B000ZOXDG4|5.0|great storyline, realistic to what her life must have been like, great actors, action packed, keeps your attention in the story
B001992NUQ|1.0|Ordered this Blu and was excited to sit down and watch it after nor seeing it in years.  Popped it in the player and it is a movie called never been kissed?????  Case is correct, label on disc is correct, but content  on dick is sooo wrong!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|very cute movie as a continuation of the previous story, great actors, enjoyable story for anyone who loves the wizard  of oz series
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is really fun. I love the challenges and quests.  Too bad I had to start over because my kindle went bad.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|great movie, interesting  story line,  very realistic effects, great actors, story keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie
B003FL4O9E|3.0|Much cornier than I remember it being, but great to relive one of my childhood favorites. Loved streaming this movie on my xbox
B004EPYZOO|5.0|lots of action, plot moves along very quickly, a lot of violence and shoot outs, cool weapons, great actors, exciting
B0055ECCT8|4.0|Watched this movie a few days ago to celebrate Robert Johnson's birthday. It's a great 80's movie with a few good blues guitar scenes
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|fantastic movie, great actors, about time someone put Ann Boleyn's story out there, shows her as a more sympathetic light than history does
B000U6BT40|5.0|I rated this with 5 stars because the series is light hearted and far fetched.  It's simply fun to watch and chill out.
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|If you like action packed movies this is the movie to watch. Although, I liked the older version of Conan the newer version is much better in my opinion. I streamed the movie and had no problems watching it.
1439127727|5.0|Enlightening to say the least.  Little known facts about how presidents relate to each other in and out of office.  A lesson in human nature at the top level of our democracy. At times not all as good as it should be--and many times not in the best interest of the country.  Lots to think about.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It is like seeing the movie over and over again. I can get lost in the music, especially while I'm exercising.  Makes the time fly by.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This a very good show, can't wait for next season. Hope next season is as good as this season was.
B008Y78GYI|4.0|Barbra Streisand is always enjoyable.  Funny Girl is no exception.  If you enjoy musicals you will really like this one.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|This was one wild ride! A story too real to be fiction--full of unexpected twists and turns. Well worth reading.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|I love this movie, and the actors and actresses who make it the movie I love.In a way I would even call it inspiring.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Frustrating , but wonderful game.  I highly recommend this app.  It requires much patience, but easily learned.  It takes you away from your worries.  Time consuming, but fun!
098357670X|5.0|This book is amazing! It has everything you need to start drawing caricatures. It is beautifully illustrated with glossy pages and a lot of written explanations. I just absolutely love it!
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Oh my! Where to begin. To say this is an icredible picture is such an understatement. It will confuse you, frustrate you, mesmerize you. In the end you'll feel like you've been on a thrilling roll-a-coaster ride and you want to go again! Acting is superb of course with Tom Hanks taking the lead. Scenes are icredibly vivid and beautiful. Watch it! More than once! I did.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|Good shown very very very Ty very good show word the bird is the word 5 more words wow one two three four five  coughs a fish alive ( stay tuned for the rest of the story
B00BF11STU|3.0|Once again, I'm glad I didn't spend my money on going to a show to see it.  It was alright.  Nothing much to talk about after the movie.  My husband didn't even have any comments about it being overly good.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|must be a good movie for me to try for the whole series, right? I only buy movies I KNOW are great!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Most of the time was spent just seeing her being a normal person, trusting a new community and falling in love.  I usually love love stories, but I contemplated turning it off half way through (it was just a bit boring).  The end was better (more exciting), but I'm glad I didn't waste my money watching it a show.  My husband would have hated this movie.  This movie should have been a made for t.v. movie.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I saw it on t.v. and decided I wanted it for my collection-- now I have it!  (last time I checked, my video collection, both vhs and dvds, was worth over $10,000.00-- kind of big).
B007REV4YI|3.0|Scenes with the Queen were not included in the US edited copy..Very disappointed in that as I think the US audiences would of liked to see her
1558908846|5.0|I saw this film years ago, I loved it, and I wanted to add it to my video collection! I have finished what I set out to do!
0393330435|5.0|Great book for me as I've been involved with computers since the early 80's.  I read a copy from the library & enjoyed it so much I decided to actually buy it, even though my bookshelves are overburdened already.  It makes a nice companion to the Jobs book.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I loved it when it first came out and I still love it today! I only buy movies that I intend on keeping in my collection AND WATCHING THEM!  lol
1932100660|3.0|We all know by now that processed foods lead to a LOT of health issues. We also know that eating primarily vegetables and other whole foods, we get more nutrients and are generally lower in body fat.<br /><br />The book connects the dots way too easily. It bridges gaps and, very convincingly, makes you forget that there could be something in those gaps. I don't agree with how the authors disseminated their data, or present it as conclusive.<br /><br />At the end of it all though, we all need to be healthier to fight off obesity and diabetes, among other things, that are becoming more and more of a problem in the US. If this is the book that motivates you to do so, the I fully support it's ability to do so. Just don't be so foolish to think they've come up with the cure to the worlds woes with one study, even if it was over 20 years. That seems like a lot, but I'd rather not base my entire lifestyle over a book that covers one area of the world for 20 years. Humans have been producing agriculture and livestock for roughly 12,000 years. So they essentially studied 0.1% of that timeline.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I liked this movie, it's just that the ending felt more like the beginning of the movie to me. It's still a fun watch, and I would highly recommend to fans of the series.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Ivery much liked this book.  Have a feeling it may be based on a true story.  Will it be made into a movie.  I hope so.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|I'm not saying this show is bad, it's watchable, but it can be very cheesy at times. I still think it has a lot of potential to be better than it is, and I'm hoping as the show progresses (if it doesn't get canned) it gets better. I'll be surprised if it lasts beyond season 1 though as every week is the same old thing again. I wish more time was spent on the backstory/island than on his new life. Maybe that's just me yearning for another &#34;Lost&#34; though.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|I have enjoyed this one very much. I have been reading a lot more latley,bet you will too, try me
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Don't watch in front of your kids, the opening scene is explicit. Lots of cursing and things of that nature throughout the movie. I'm not gonna say it was horrible, but if I had it to do over I probably wouldnt watch it.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Anthony Hopkins IS Alfred Hitchcock.  Wonderful nostalgic movie.  I'll watch it again in a few months.  Doubtful if it will mean much to anyone younger than 50.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Great animated movie about being happy with who you are. I love it, my kids love it. Highly recommend to the parents out there from the 80's.
B0091REZMW|3.0|A little too slow moving for me.  I like a challenge that makes you think, however this made me feel limited.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I found this movie to be pretty boring and uneventful. I appreciate the fact that it was based on true events, but that didn't stop me from falling asleep 3-4 times during it.
B00CBKVMG8|5.0|This film takes you back in time to the period where men dressed and acted like men.  The visualization of the movie was great.  It is your typical gangster movie but with some great stars.  I don't think it did as well as expected in the box office because of the changing of the film and the move of its original release date.  It ended up coming out at the new year when it just couldn't compete with the other bigger hits.  It would have been a great summer movie or early fall like originally planned.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I guess my biggest disappointment was the fact that the best part of the movie was the end, and I already knew what was going to happen. I had hoped for a better lead up to the final act, but wasn't very impressed. Watchable, but not great.
0142410705|5.0|An Abundance of Katherines by John Green is just plain fun to read!<br /><br />John Green does a great job with his characters and drawing a reader into the novel; Colin, a child prodigy now in his teens, could easily have been a stuck-up smartie pants unable to be truly accepted and understood by readers.<br /><br />The novel follows Colin at the end of his relationship with the 19th Katherine he's ever dated. Uninspired and struggling, Colin's best friend Hassan suggests a road trip and the boys set off. They end up in Gutshot, Tennessee at the Archduke Franz Ferdinand's burial site and the story really takes off from there.<br /><br />Using his experience with Katherines, Colin is attempting to write a theorum to predict the length of any relationship! With a comedic best friend and a new friend & coworker Lindsey, Colin sets off on healing his broken heart.<br /><br />This was an endearing YA novel that really had me laughing and smiling along the whole way through. I'm looking forward to reading more John Green. I would definitely suggest this book to others!<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]

0553386794|5.0|What to say about A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin? IT IS SO FRAKKIN' EPIC!!! =) I love the tv show. LOVE IT. So I thought I'd check out the novels that started it all.<br /><br />There is so much more detail behind the characters in the novel [compared to the television series]. My favorite characters from the show are John Snow, Arya Stark, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister. In the novel, I also really adore Rob Stark. He's such a strong young man in this first novel of the \\"Songs of Fire & Ice\\" series and I feel almost a sort of pride as to his going to war to defend his father's honor.<br /><br />Also, Tyrion is a god among men. He uses his sharp tongue and wit to handle the world of A Game of Thrones and I really applaud the writing of this complex character. There is also a lot about Daenerys `the mother of dragons' and her love for Drogo, her Khaal. The writing is incredibly detailed, but Martin does not get stuck in the muck of the details.<br /><br />Every line of the novel had me enthralled.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
055358202X|3.0|An ok follow up. Not much (nothing huge) happens again, and even less than Book 3. I hated reading Cersei's chapters. Most of it was the same internal monologue over and over again. Brienne's chapters are pretty much her riding and riding and riding. Arya has some great chapters but they are few and far between. It doesn't help that this book was originally in with Book 5 and Martin splits half the characters up so there are a lot of \\"wait, when did that happen?\\" or \\"wait, did that happen?\\" moments that you don't get until Book 5. I honestly can't understand how Martin keeps fans with a six year gap between books. If I had to wait this long, I don't think I would have the patience to read, wait, play catch up, and then care about the characters anymore because I would have forgotten all about them. This was a \\"meh\\" chapter to the story and I'm not sure Book 5 will be any better. Nothing huge was revealed that we didn't already know and it doesn't appear to set up a whole lot...except maybe more horse riding. Huzah. Final Grade - B-

0061684384|4.0|At first I was expecting just a bunch of tattoo images done by Kat, but to my surprise the book is much more than that! It has her biography and how she started to build her career even before she appeared on Miami Ink. Also, the quality of the paper is outstanding, the images it has are also great! The only thing that I didn't like is that after a couple of weeks the sheets started to fall apart from the book!!
0060005696|2.0|I do not doubt that there can be too many choices. Some research shows that we have trouble choosing when we have many choices. However, this is not sufficient material to write a book around. The author really tries hard to turn a few pieces of research into some overarching narrative. This narrative is more a reflection of the author's own personal views than anything resembling research. For instance he builds a straw man that it is common knowledge among economists that more choices equals more consumer welfare. There is no such view in economics. Large sections read like a middle-age man's rant about too many choices in areas in which he is not familiar, but that is probably a little bit too hard. Another problem with the book is the one-sided selection of examples. What the author totally fails to understand is that a lot of variety will also lead to innovation. Yes, there might be 100 products that are similar, but there will also be 2 that are distinctly different. Variety is created by individual human agents and it is impossible to know which of the agents will be the ones innovating. Hayek talked about the problem of to location of knowledge in a society. The author does not understand anything of this and I doubt that he has read a single course in economics or sociology. I will give the book two stars because there is some grain of truth in what the author says as long as he talk about psychology.
B0037NVM2C|4.0|I love the movies on amazon prime!  Good streaming, picture, audio, and easy to watch.  I usually have no problem at all with these movies.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|I already have the 25th anniversary blu-ray edition of this movie, but I was wondering if the 4k would really upgrade the video quality which is not that great on the earlier edition, and this newer edition (at $14.99) was cheap enough to experiment with. I do not have any of the very expensive 4k equipment but the 4k is advertised that it will improve a regular blu-ray. Side by side with the earlier blu-ray version, I would say that there is a noticeable upgrade in the foreground of the scene and some shots come out very clear. It is enough of an improvement that I am keeping this one, but don't get rid of your earlier editions because this one does not have any features. The 25th anniversary blu has all the original dvd features plus some forgetable new features such as info on the Ghostbusters video game. So I am keeping them both. Amazon has the unfortunate habit of using all 555 reviews which go back to the dvd version which I find very confusing when I am trying to decide if an upgrade is worth it. As to the movie itself, it is still funny almost 30 years later, which is a testament to all the great actors, writer and the director, so I can't give it less than a five.

B005LAII3U|5.0|I finally got around to watching the latest Total Recall movie, and I loved it! I'd heard the moaning and groaning about the movie prior to watching it, and it's one of the reasons I took my time. I've really got to stop letting that stuff get to me! This film was one wild ride!<br /><br />Now, the original film came out in my teens, so I was at just the right age to be completely hooked on it, along with other Verhoeven films such as RoboCop and Starship Troopers. When I heard they were doing a remake of Total Recall, my first reaction was like when I heard about the upcoming RoboCop remake... why? The first was so awesome and still holds up.<br /><br />Then I heard the hate over the news that in the remake, Quaid doesn't go to Mars. This seemed blasphemous to fans but it doesn't bother me one bit. Consider the source material: in Philip K. Dick's short story, \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,\\" Quail (his name in the story) does not go to Mars. The character had already been to Mars, hence his longing to go after his memory was wiped, but we never see the character leave Earth.<br /><br />Normally, when remakes are done, I'm fine with them so long as they're well-made and they're not carbon copies of the original. The Psycho remake was pointless, in my opinion, as was The Hitcher clone (though the sequel was a hoot). If you're going to tell the story again, do your own thing while paying tribute.<br /><br />The latest Total Recall pulls this off, and it does so beautifully. On most occasions, I prefer the version that can be closest to the source material, like John Carpenter's The Thing - it was much closer to \\"Who Goes There?\\" than the old The Thing from Another World. However, the short story for Total Recall was actually more of a comedy. Outside of the initial visit to the clinic, it's good that both films do their own thing, and because of the originality we see in both, we have two great, action-packed sci-fi films that stem from the same idea, and the remake does make some great nods to the original which makes it all the more fun.remake does make some great nods to the original which makes it all the more fun.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Probably not the usual reason for liking the Kindle Android ap  . . .<br />I don't have a tablet, but I downloaded Kindle for my netbook as soon as it was available, a few years ago.<br />It wasn't as convenient or as comfortable as I would have liked; and though I had found some books that I wanted to read, I didn't–after I'd gotten part way through the first one–read any of the other books I'd downloaded.<br /><br />Though I used to read constantly, after a bad concussion over a decade ago, reading just wasn't the pleasure it used to be, so I rarely read. Recently I got an Android phone and downloaded Kindle, since it was free and would maybe come in handy in a waiting room once in a while. I tried reading one of the novels I'd been intending to read, thinking that the tiny screen would be a problem, but to my great surprise, it wasn't at all. It's perfect. I zipped through that book and started another. I haven't done that for nearly fourteen years. So, I figure that one of my issues with reading (and computer screens) is &#34;too much stuff&#34; on a page, even on an ordinary size book page.<br /><br />So Kindle for Android? MY Android phone? Ten stars!

B009I2UH2W|2.0|I bought this charger for my iPhone 5 in March and it worked great at first.  Then in April, a few weeks after using it, I noticed that my car outlet stopped working.  I switched it to the second charger port and it worked for a few days, then it also went out.  I have had my Lexus RX400h for seven years, and I have had to change the regular battery only once and NEVER had any issues with the charger ports.  I had the auto repair shop take a look when I had my oil changed last week and they changed out the fuses and everything worked great.  Three days later, the port where my charger was plugged in went out, but the other one worked.  I took it back to the car place today, and they told me that they tested it and it was the charger, not the car.  When they plugged it and out a few times after changing the fuse, it blew the new fuse!  They told me to get rid of this charger and get another one.  I have never seen this happen before, but they say that it happens with certain brands of power chargers.  I am requesting a full refund given the circumstances.  We'll see what the seller/Amazon will do and how easy it is to return.  It is already past the official normal window for returns, but we'll see what they say since this is an unforeseen issue.  I will post an update after I get my refund (if I do).  For the price (over $20), I would expect that they would be accommodating, and I have read good things about other Griffin products.  We shall see..... very disappointed so far with this.....<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The seller refunded my cost as well as shipping, due to the malfunction that caused my car to have to get fixed.  It took a little while, but they were good about it.  Lesson learned:  Don't buy anything for your Apple device unless it explicitly states that it is APPLE CERTIFIED!  I ended up buying the Skiva Car Charger (Apple Certified) for only $17.99 (free two-day shipping with Amazon Prime) and haven't had any problems since!

B00B7364H2|4.0|I ordered this from Amazon UK and have been listening to it for a month or so. I missed out on Vol 1, and I didn't want to repeat that. Amazon usa wants $158 for this box, but you can get it for $113 from import cds, delivered.<br /><br />I remember having a few of these Mercurys when I was in college in the early '60's, and being more impressed by the sound (very up front)than the performances. Having listened to most of these discs, my initial impressions remain unchanged. The first twenty or so discs are by Dorati, mostly with the London Symphony (very good) and the Minneapolis Orchestra (not so good). I recall going to a few Dorati/BBC Orchestra concerts in England while I was a student, and finding him to be an above average journeyman conductor. He tackles Beethoven, Dvorak,Tchaikovsky, Bartok and a few others in this set, but you'll find no fresh insights here, just good performances very well recorded. In the included book, it states that there was no remixing after the tapes had been laid down, so Mercury conductors were expected to handle their orchestral balances in real time. Very impressive!<br /><br />There are eight discs by Paray/Detroit Symphony, mostly of French repertoire. Most of these are very good, if a little speedy. Ravel's Bolero is more of a gallop. All are well recorded.<br /><br />Howard Hanson figures in ten discs, with three of his symphonies, plus a lot of material from American composers, only some of which is worth listening to. The Eastman-Rochester orchestra is less than terrific - very undernourished strings. Two of these discs, called \\"Music for quiet listening\\" appear to have escaped from one of those old Readers Digest sets.<br /><br />Fred Fennell has nine discs of various marches and music for winds, in which I have zero interest and therefore am unable to comment. Audiophiles (who are the main target for this set) will probably love them.<br /><br />There are also three harpsichord discs, one organ, one Corigliano concerto,and a mono Rite of Spring.<br /><br />I would say that I liked over thirty of this set, with the rest staying in the box.<br /><br />The recordings here are very impressive, given the vintage (over 50 years old).<br /><br />The book provided here fell apart in short order, just like the one in the Philips box. Decca needs to fire its supplier for these books, although the Decca Sound box's book remains intact.<br /><br />The Living Stereo and Vivarte boxes are the best constructed, and have the nicest books. Also the most enticing repertoire. The Decca Sound and EMI Eminence sets are both very good, and thematically better presented than this Mercury set.<br /><br />None of the above will matter a whit to the rabid audiophiles who will covet this set, and be up all night arguing about its considerable merits.<br /><br />Just remember - these big boxes give you cds for $2-3 each! If you only like 50%, you're still ahead of the game!

0399159029|5.0|Sometimes you find a book you want to curl up on the couch and read on a rainy day.  This book is perfect for this.  Bernie Gunther is like a Phillip Marlowe but stationed in Prague during the Nazi era.  This book is so rich full of history and intrigue that you can't put it down.  Everyone is a suspect, and everyone you meet has a shady past.  Bernie is an honest man navigating his way through a corrupt system with the war on it way, and this book doesn't shy away from the genocide that is coming.  Truly an amazing read, you won't be putting this one down until you have finished reading.

But, hey, I decided, I'll just watch each episode twice to make sure I can follow it--and now I get to watch even more of Revenge!!  I'm guessing the producers are watching the feedback and will make the right changes so that Season 3 will be more to our liking.

030758836X|1.0|This book was highly recommended to me by the owner of my favorite bookstore.  She warned me that I may not like some of the characters, but I assured her that if the story were good, I was good with that.  She failed to mention an even bigger offense--the book had no real ending.  Throughout the entire back and forth between the two narrators they hint, and allude, and coyly promise bigger things to come.  The book is full of moments when one of the two main characters subtly drops a morsel into the narrative, and it made me eager to find out what it meant, what was next?  Each chapter gets more intricate, and I kept thinking that she would have to come up with something mind-blowing to cover all of the twists and turns that the book unveils.  You can imagine how horribly disappointed I was with the ending that wasn't.  The ending was flat out RIDICULOUS!!!  It was not in keeping with the characters, their motives, and it was sorely lacking any comeuppance.  In short, don't bother--a fairly intriguing premise was ruined by a pathetic ending.

B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Neither my husband or I have read the Jack Reacher books, so we watched this purely as a standalone action/mystery movie, and we enjoyed it. Cruise is riveting and believable as the aloof, intelligent Reacher with a mysterious past and semi-maniacal dedication to truth. The movie plot held our attention - it begins with a sniper picking off 5 people, seemingly at random, and leaving enough clues that he is quickly caught. However, as Reacher investigates, things become cloudier, and we aren't sure who is behind the shooting or why. The twists are revealed at the perfect pace - fast enough to keep you intrigued, but slow enough that you keep wondering if it's going to twist another direction. My only complaint - which is a common one for me - is the violence levels. I'm ok with a gritty story, and violence that is a necessary part of the plot, but some of if here just bugged me, such as the scene of a man trying to chew off his own fingers, or the one where a young woman is killed for knowing too much. Both could have been briefer and less graphic, and played the role they needed to in the overall plot. I assume they were part of the book(s) and they were trying to be true to this, but in my opinion it's time for Hollywood to ask some tough questions about the violence they portray and how they portray it, and to cut the details when it's an option. It's all gotten way to glamorized.
0385341008|4.0|A very different kind of book, mainly involving personal letters written to different people. It's an interesting piece of fiction, which seems real at times. My mother was born in St. Peter Port on Guernsey, so determining the validity about written facts on the occupation was a little confusing, and left me wanting clarification.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great read! I ordered it wondering how the author was going to fill a whole book with an encounter that took a matter of minutes to unfold, but he did a masterful job of rolling in the history of two prestigious flight units. Highly recommended.
193700788X|1.0|I really had high hopes for this book after the last two books were so dissapointing.  Maybe that makes me crazy for expecting a different outcome.<br /><br />SPOILERS (BE WARNED)<br /><br />Where is the funny Sookie that was in the first nine books?  Why is this book filled with so much minutia?  Looking into Sookie's daily life was once a part of the story I enjoyed, but not what I expected the author to spend so much time on in the final book of a series.  Who cares about chopping tomatoes, shaving legs, blah, blah.<br /><br />Her ending up with Sam is not what bothered me, it is how Sam ended up being thrown in at the last minute with no build up at all.  Yes, Sookie has said he was attractive, but she always thought of him as a FRIEND.  Poor Sam, he gets Sookie by default.  Don't even get me started on the sex scene - slippery seal sex in a trailer??  Seriously?  Sookie's dry hump with Quinn was more entertaining than that.  Now, I think I might have to hold my stomach the next time I visit an aquarium.<br /><br />I don't see how Sookie is better off than in the first book.  Yes, she is a simple girl with simple needs but the supes opened up a new world to her.  This is fiction, not real life - Sookie's ending could have been so much more interesting than how she started.  A barmaid who can now have slippery seal sex in a trailer next to the bar she works in (I don't care if she is part owner) = EVERY girls dream!  Um, no.<br /><br />Charlaine Harris sure did attract the romance reader to this series - as she has said many times \\"they buy a lot of books.\\"  How can you target a specific audience yet not consider even trying to come close to following at least some the guidelines for that genre?  CH mislead me in another series where the heroine goes for the safe bet vs. the one where the heroine actually had chemistry with, so I should have expected this ending.  However, at least that series had some lead up to the HEA whereas this one specifically did not.<br/><br />Sookie could have ended up with anyone - I didn't care as up until this book all suitors seemed to still have a chance.  The writing was rushed and there was very little plot.<br /><br />The first 9 books were like crack to me and I simply couldn't put them down, the next three were mediocre at best, this book was just awful.

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This movie was ridiculous. Horrible acting, zero character development, nonsensical plot line, unrealistic situations, and just generally a dumbed down big budget insult to human intelligence.<br /><br />The last action movie that I can remember being this bad was \\"The Jackal\\" starring Bruce Willis.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I, like many others, are so very disappointed with the ending.  If this was the ending CH had in mind, then I cannot help but feel used because most of the books are about Sookie and Eric and the troubles they go through to be together.  She destroyed Eric's character in the last book. I didn't even recognize Sookie!  I also cannot help but wonder a)  did she change how she was going to write the series based on Eric/Sookie because he was such a fan favourite and it was easy to sell the books  with him as the main male character  and/or  b) because he was such a favourite and we were not all crazy about Sam that she wrote such a horrible ending for him.  One last dig to the fans who loved Eric from the start...personally I think it is both.  Easy to sell the books with a fan favourite like Eric!<br /><br />The books don't even make sense now!  As a writer, you would think you may have to change some of your ideas based on how the remainder of the books were written.  She may have wanted that ending originally but that isn't the series she wrote.<br /><br />I haven't loved the last few books but kept with it thinking that it would all come together in the end.  So not the case.  I never would have kept up with the series from the beginning had it not been for Eric.  I never bought Sam as anything other than a BFF as this was how he was written.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like DragonVale. It's more generous than most other of these types of games, and you don't HAVE TO buy gems to play. My son had been playing for a few months and one day the park was there and the next day it wasn't. We were playing on the locally stored park and it acted like we had never played (blank park, no dragons). I finally figured out that he had accidentally switched from saving it locally to saving it on Facebook. Just a tip in case it happens to anyone else.

B0060AY85C|4.0|Let me say that I served in the tail end of WWII when the army was still segregated, and also traveled through the deep south back when segregation was the law. Horrible to realize such could be the case in our country.<br /><br />Then I spent three years serving in the Korean War (well, \\"Police Action\\" was the euphemism). Truman did get the armed forces desecrated, but there was just as much prejudice prevalent.  I mention this so it will be understood that I empathize with the characters as described in this book.<br /><br />The spare but powerful writing reminds me of Hemingway. The plight of the downtrodden black people in those days, also shames me that it could occur here, both in the North and the South.<br /><br />So much so that it is very depressing. I can easily understand how somebody like Frank would struggle with life as he had to live it, especially being a decorated war veteran. Yet he encountered helpful and sympathetic people along his journey, albeit no white folks at all.<br /><br />The fact that he and his sister rose above all that was thrown their way and remained honest decent people, especially at the end was somewhat uplifting, yet it left me sad and disturbed. Still and all, it should be read.

193700788X|5.0|This goes straight to Charlaine Harris. \\"Outstanding.\\" There are so many turns in \\"Dead Ever After,\\" that if I had been driving I'd be nauseous by now.<br /><br />I started reading the series when \\"True Blood\\" was in its third season.  I was frustrated watching the show.  I honestly didn't know the series was based on a book.  That began my journey into this clever, inspiring world of Sookie Stackhouse.  I read the third book to get a handle on the tv series. Soon after I was onto the first book, \\"Dead Until Dark\\".  I went through the series lickety-split.  Always hungry for the next book.  Sometimes salivating for the next one or the opportunity to read a few chapters on her website.<br /><br />Each new book's cover gave hints but not enough for me to solve the mystery, which I really appreciate. I'm usually the one person in the room watching a mystery and figuring it out within the first 20 minutes.  It's refreshing to be surprised for a change. Ms. Harris you really saved the best for last.<br /><br />These books are SAUCY!  These books are not for teens. There's more gravy in these books then there is on the show or in a buffet.  Ladies will not be let down by the bold courage that Sookie demonstrates.  The honesty of human nature is everywhere.  I love that the F word is not flung around in her books.  Charlaine expresses herself well. There are not blatant obscenities flashed here and there for flavor but a robust use of language, expressions (known and unknown) and clear wit.<br /><br />Her characters are well thought out.  My favorite line in book four, \\"That flipped his bic.\\"  Classic and schooooo schexy.  (Yeah, that was on purpose.)<br /><br />There are many people, artists, editors, publicists, co-writers, designers, researchers, fans, advisers, wives, husbands, friends and children behind Ms. Harris to make these books so completely divine.  So my brain thanks you for your contributions and support.<br /><br />In addition you really can't go wrong reading her other titles; The Aurora Teagarden books are my second favorite, Ace Anthologies, Berkley Prime Crime books, Harper Connelly (it's out there), and Lily Bard.  I couldn't possibly be CH's biggest fan, if I was to label myself I'd be considered a \\"Welter Weight\\".<br /><br />Also thank you for putting your books in Large Print.  My eyes appreciate the gesture.<br />Be Well.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I rented this because my grand kids wanted to watch it. I began watching with them  and I couldn't get anything done..It was so interesting and captivating that I ended up sitting down with them. I would recommend this video to all moms.

193700788X|1.0|I have been a longtime fan of this series. I don't understand why the author chose to end it on such a sour note. If this is CH's idea of a HEA, then she and I have different ideas of love. I was disgusted by the events of this book and I hate that an otherwise wonderful series had to end this way.<br /><br /> I hate that Sookie isn't with Eric. I would have settled for Alcide or Quinn. They were respectable, alpha men but CH tossed them away books ago. But to settle for Sam in the last 20 pages of the book when they have not even kissed, or shared any affection  was just wrong. I'm to believe that one kiss that led to sex is Sookie's HEA? I say good riddance and I will never touch another CH book again!!!

It is a far more straight-forward plot and, while the characters are still a bit screwy, there is nothing on the scale of the twisted brilliance of &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.

0756404746|5.0|I read some of the bad reviews for this book, but still bought it on a friend's recommendation.  Glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews, this book is well written, with good character development and a style i like.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this case it allows you to carry it for a long time between charges. And you always have a safe place to keep you headset, so it doesn't get damage. I would recommend this to anyone who likes cases for stuff. Plus it charges. You can use the wall charger from your headset to charger it instead of your computer. And you always know how much charger both have left. highly recommended.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I knew before I bought this book basically what it was about.  While I thought the story in and of itself was incredible, I liked the fact the author let the reader 'get to know' these gentleman.  I think what I liked most about this book was that I learned more about the war in a different persprective than I did in all my History classes combined.  I read this book all-the-while feeling as if I was there in person and not mearly reading about it so many years later.  What happens between these 2 men in the short time they spent in the air together encompasses almost every emotion and the reader feels that too.
B0088W7VNG|4.0|There are some great episodes, some good ones....and a few not so good, but overall this is a fun and entertaining show.  We started out watching the SG - Universe version then on to this one....we have also tried some of the SG-1 shows but so far have not liked them as much as Universe or Atlantis.  It is awful that they cancelled Universe and Atlantis so early into the storylines.  I believe if they had the time to further develop them, the shows would have had a better showing in the ratings.  I certainly find these much more appealing then some dumpy housefrau's dotterings in New Jersey or what have you.  I get enough reality from real life...I don't want to turn on the TV to see more of it.
0060557818|3.0|As a geek, I was behind on my cred, not having read one of Gaiman's core novels (I have read American Gods, to which I had much the same response I had to Neverwhere), so I picked this up and gave it a go.<br /><br />It has much the same strengths and weaknesses of other Gaiman novels I've read.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Smooth, astonishingly easy-to-read style that makes the pages fly by. I'd be surprised if Gaiman doesn't read his writing out loud as he writes, to test its flow--it sounds like a storyteller speaking. (And, having heard him read out loud in person and on audiobook, he is a pleasure to listen to, telling stories.)<br />- Spare but effective imagery that creates mood and suggests otherworldly scenes very well.<br />- Willingness to kill characters you don't expect to die (though he rarely goes far enough with his body count to *really* surprise you).<br />- Wry humor that shows up even in the darkest scenes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Flat characters! I've read some of his Sandman graphic novels, and his characters fare better there, where you don't expect to do more than watch them. When you're riding around seeing them close to the ground, in their own heads, you realize how little meat they've got. Mayhew is the always-nice no-flaws-except-disorganized-wistfulness Everyman, de Carabas is the dry deceptive showman, Door is--sad sometimes but mostly just determined and love-interest-y playful now and then. Hunter is the tough taciturn loner lesbian (and her fate doesn't break any new ground in Things That Happen to Lesbian Characters in Novels). By the end of the novel, I felt like I had more sense of Croup and Vandemar's history than anyone else's.<br />- Plot shortcuts. Again, in a graphic novel (or, say, a TV miniseries...), a lot of what's going on here would look awesome--weird, bizarre, moody. The shortcuts might not matter so much, painted over and around by that rich visual whirl. But in a novel, I'm left going--so why could Richard see Door? Why was Richard so good at everything when so many others had failed before (I can't say more there without giving away spoilers)? The characters' successes rarely felt earned, as opposed to just *required.*<br /><br />Verdict? Read it if you're looking for a quick fantasy hit, and want something with a little darkness and a lot of London. Otherwise, there are other books in the sea.was Richard so good at everything when so many others had failed before (I can't say more there without giving away spoilers)?

B00BB22GQM|5.0|Is there any frontman more astute at dealing with the fickleness of the indie blogosphere than Ezra Koenig? Rather than ride trends like so many other bands, the songwriting core of New York indie pop superstars Vampire Weekend filter out the excess background noise and have easily turned out the biggest artistic leap forward in their career.<br /><br />Though their first two records were both standout, Modern Vampires of the City is more ambitious and forward thinking than anything in their career. It finds Koenig musing on heavy topics, ranging from religion and God to death, society, and history. Meanwhile, the sonic landscape has been altered and bears little in common with the afropop/Paul Simon aesthetic that dotted the first two albums. Rather, Modern Vampires of the City pulls from a diverse array of sounds and influences to weave together something that sounds familiar, but the presentation is fresh and unique.<br /><br />Death is a continual theme explored on the record; \\"Unbelievers\\" tackles the topic of heretics burned at the stake, \\"Everlasting Arms\\" paints the scene of a couple's final embrace before a dramatic death, while lead single \\"Diane Young\\" was originally slated to be titled \\"Dying Young,\\"  but was shifted into a homonym in an attempt to lighten its mood.<br /><br />Aesthetic wise, Vampire Weekend continue to focus on crafting catchy pop music while creating a constantly shifting and continually evolving palette of influences to back it up. There is a running theme of soul/gospel overtones that dot the album's landscape, beginning with the vocal arrangements of Koenig and his background singers on album opener \\"Obvious Bicycle.\\" \\"Ya Hey\\" the most striking example of this, however. It contains imagery ranging from God to the motherlands of Israel, and features Ezra being backed up by a holy aria of gospel singers, while singing in what sounds like language pulled straight out of the Bible.<br /><br />Along the way there are some rapid fire tracks backed up with spoken word sections (Finger Back), some yearning ballads (Hannah Hunt), some occasional electro buzz, and even historical musings. \\"Step\\" references the splendor of Angkor Wat and Dar es Salam, while the haunting \\"Hudson\\" details the death of Henry Hudson. Gurgling and bubbling synthesizers in the background seek to emulate the tide of the Hudson Bay where Henry vanished.<br /><br />This album represents the biggest development of the band's sound to date, and in fact one of the biggest breakthroughs for virtually any band in recent memory. The amount of different effects they come up with is staggering; just to come up with the idea to put some of this stuff in is more than what would occur to many bands, but to mix it together and make it all work is nothing short of astounding. Even more so when you consider that there really isn't a weak track in the bunch. Pop music is often viewed as lacking substance or even considered disposable, yet albums like Modern Vampires of the City, along with Justin Timberlake's recently released The 20/20 Experience, are proving that pop can be a complex organism, and a legitimate art form in and of itself.<br /><br />That isn't to say that this is a perfect album. Koening's insistence on belaboring the point about death and spirituality can be overwrought and heavy handed at times, and the result is Vampire Weekend's attempt to forge their masterpiece sometimes seems less than effortless. It certainly doesn't match up to their self titled in terms of sheer joy and fun factor. Which means that the debate over whether this is their best album is not so clear cut as it may seem, even if it is their most advanced work.<br /><br />Yet at the end of the day, there's a lot to dissect here, which is not common for a predominately pop based album. Among an ever shifting collage of sound and mood, historical figures from the past resurrect themselves, while Koenig takes sober glimpses into the possible, if not likely future of our generation. It's not hard to tell you're in the presence of a band operating on a another level, surely inspired by some higher power.

B00BB22GQM|5.0|The short version: this is an excellent, beautiful album that is one of the best I've heard in a really long time.  I've had it on repeat since I downloaded it.  Although it's a new direction for Vampire Weekend, fans of the old albums will likely enjoy this one as well.  UPDATE:  After another day of having this album on repeat, I can honestly say that it is my favorite album in years.  There is a depth and range to this album that is unlike any other single band out there.  I loved Vampire Weekend's earlier albums, but with Modern Vampires, they have matured into a really amazing band.<br /><br />This album reflects a new sound for Vampire Weekend. With their self-titled album and Contra, there was a definite Kwassa-Kwassa, Graceland-Inspired Pop sound.  Although they could never be characterized as immature, their albums reflected the youth of the band.<br /><br />Modern Vampires is a more mature album.  The end of youth, the passage of time (or trying to stop it) and, ultimately, death figure large in this album.  Many of songs are stripped down and more pure, if somewhat melancholy.  Others contain the frenetic energy of VW's earlier albums, but presented in a deeper way.  As I saw written somewhere else, VW's earlier albums were written for the party at the beginning of the night, and Modern Vampires is the album of the songs they play once everyone but a few stragglers have gone home.<br /><br />This is a wide and deep album exhibiting the amazing range of VW.  Some songs invoke the synth beats I loved in [[ASIN:B002EAP0FE LP]].  Other songs are haunting, including the standout Hannah Hunt, tracing a cross-country journey.  Others, like Worship You, are nonstop and frenetic.  Step has an infectious rhythm that will be stuck in your head for days.  Every song, no matter the style, however, presents a new sound for VW.  The harpsichord is toned down, the beats are more prevalent, but through it all the sound is tighter and more focused.<br /><br />That's not to say that fans of the past albums will not enjoy Modern Vampires.  Lead singer Ezra Koenig returns with his brilliant lyrics and masterful flow.  Once again he manages to weave a thread through songs making references you'll be lucky to understand half of, yet it doesn't come across as condescending.  Regardless, this is a beautiful album that I can tell will be in heavy rotation for me.say that fans of the past albums will not enjoy Modern Vampires.

193700788X|3.0|Dear Ms. Harris,<br /><br />You suck.  You mustered up some enthusiasm for Sookie Stackhouse and Bon Temps only to crush the hopes of your devoted fans by giving Sookie a happily ever after that isn't happy at all.<br /><br />Here is why you suck:<br /><br />1.  You ended the series.  Surely there were thousands of stories involving Sookie you could have continued to write about but instead you decided to burn your bridges and start another book series.<br /><br />2.  Your past few books have been horrible and you finally pull yourself together to write another fun book and it is just in time for the series to end.<br /><br />3.  You expect us to believe that hot, alpha male vampire Eric would give up everything (including Sookie) to be a sex slave to a vampire queen?  What have you been smoking?<br /><br />4.  You ended the series by creating a relationship for Sookie that is completely inappropriate for her.  Yes, Sookie is your character but if you were a decent writer you would have built this romantic relationship up over a few books instead of just jack hammering it into the series finale.<br /><br />5.  You hired a continuity editor who should be ashamed that you named her in your last few books.  She is incompetent at best.  For your next series hire a real professional instead of someone pretending to be one.<br /><br />To be fair I did enjoy some of this book.  It was better written than most of your books and Sookie seemed energized and hopeful but I thought it was odd that she barely blinked when an important relationship ended.  That is not the Sookie we all know and love but love Sookie I did and although I hate that you have given up on her I have not.<br /><br />It seems to me that you didn't care about your characters or your readers so I wouldn't get too excited about the sales for your upcoming series that debuts in the fall.  I for one will not be getting out my pocketbook for anymore books written by you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />A Former Fanr Fan

B0095P33IW|5.0|I love the Avengers series. It represents the characters from the Book of Revelation in the Bible. The first Avenger, Captain America, &#34;saves&#34; the day at the end of the story. The time is approaching. Start paying attention!
B000000WJ2|5.0|The stones haven't produced a solid, much less great album since their amazing run of four culminating with &#34;Exile on Main Street.&#34; This album and its predecessor &#34;Talk is Cheap&#34; are far superior to any Stones album since. Simply put, if you don't like these albums, you don't like rock and roll
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is a very interesting series, strong cast, great plots and well crafted. The story line is original and the episodes stand alone but also form an interesting experience for the viewe. I am looking forward to season 4.
1567184855|5.0|Still reading, but....  believe in ghosts and some possible &#34;afterlife&#34;.  This may or may not be it, but gets one thinking.  I find it much more comforting than any earthly religion!!!
B0097K21YW|5.0|This is  like Angry Birds the only bad is that is too expensive to get another character. But the rest keep getting interesting
B0092QITO2|3.0|I figured it was going to be hard to get away from  [[ASIN:B000IHL52W Verhooven's original 1990 Total Recall]] and its cheezy, over-the-top charm, with the mutant prostitutes, comical asphyxiating robot faces, Arnold's wacky dramatic vocalizations and that dramatic instant terraforming of Mars.  This remake, with its non-Martian, non-mutant storyline departed from the original immediately and effectively, with occasional fun nods to the original, a nice \\"two weeks\\" take being just one.<br /><br />But unfortunately, in the end, literally, the ridiculous story devices and completely impossible physics ruined most of what it had going for it.  It's a fun diversion, but that's about it.<br /><br />The visual world is very cool, with some outstanding CGI.  A lot of the future tech is very good, quite imaginative, like embedded communication devices that project interactive interfaces onto any glass surface and a police gadget that penetrates a room and disperses uplinked mini video cameras to a man-portable router/screen.  Cool stuff.<br /><br />The maglev cars, featured in the Big Car Chase (BCC), just don't pass the common sense test.  Just like that horrible, horrible, audience-insulting device in [[ASIN:B000PMG16U Star Wars: Episode 1]] of fixing a submerged broken vehicle by tweaking a couple of wires in the center console, we get the same here, with the very nerve center of the sophisticated maglev car being right there in the center.  Awful.<br /><br />The BCC is all mag-levy, and is cool enough, but then Hauser dirves off the grid, literally falls away and gets away.  Why can't the bad guys do the same?  He falls down, so can't they just see him?  Or fall down, too?  Where are the flying units?  There are no ground units?  Radios?  And his lady is out cold in the passenger seat, with gawking locals all around him, and yet he somehow manages to get her up and out of the vehicle and away and into his apartment without any noticing where he's going?  Awful.<br /><br />In the end it's physics and logic that doom this film.  How is it that this \\"Fall\\" thingy passes through the Earth's core?  That's the diameter of the Earth, something like 7900 miles.  And in this movie the trip takes about 15 minutes.  Okay, kids, that's an average speed of . . . wait for it . . . 31,608 mph.  That's roughly Mach 45.  What kind of physical structure can travel at Mach 45, through a tunnel?  The physics of aerodynamics and atmospheric displacement make this impossible.  Imagine the heat generated by the air friction; the whole stupid thing would burst into flames at half that speed.  And then through the Earth's core, at 13,000 degrees F?  How is it the Earth's molten core doesn't just shoot out of the hole?  Wouldn't this make it difficult for our heroes to climb on the outside of the vehicle to escape the bad guys?<br /><br />And if I were a clever little Resistance fighter, and apparently Bill Nighy's miniscule role of Matthias is a smart rebel, I'd note that the only real threat to my domain is the vehicle that comes up through the hole, so why not bomb or disable or otherwise plug up the hole?  Hauser manages to do that all by himself with a few nicely placed explosives in the space of less than 15 minutes--why can't the rebels toss a huge bomb down the hole, drop a car or a truck or a rock or a piano or a good ol' fashioned Acme(tm) anvil down the hole?  At a closing speed better than 30,000 mph, any of those would do some damage, at least enough to take away the threat that is the basis for the entire story.<br /><br />And then there's the whole frantic elevator-shaft chase/fight thing.  As if people would design all of this without the slightest consideration of auto-stop systems in the event of obstructions in the pathways.  Awful, again.<br /><br />I like Brian Cranston, more his [[ASIN:B00006G8J7 Malcolm in the Middle]] dad than [[ASIN:B0060MYKYY Breaking Bad]] methlord, so looked forward to this.  Cranston's got a lot to live up to in Ronny Cox's original Cohaagen, and he didn't get there.  The ridiculous big blond wig was the first indication; if you're going to guss up your character like that, then the character is going to have to be one seriously over the top bad guy (think Wez in [[ASIN:B000KJZWMW The Road Warrior]]).  But Cranston didn't make it, not even close.  Hauser is lauded throughout the film as the baddest of the badasses, yet when it comes down to the Big Final Fight, the two dudes mano-a-mano, somehow Cranston's over-coiffed bureaucrat is besting the \\"greatest intelligence agent in the world?\\"  It was pathetic and ridiculous, a fight that ended completely predictably, but should have been over after the first swing.<br /><br />And in the water?  Water, on the top of a vehicle that just traveled at more than 31,000 mph right through the Earth's core?  Wouldn't it be a bit hot for water?  And how did it even get there?  It's just another lame movie gimmick to make lame slo-mo action look more than it really is.<br /><br />And am I the only who got a serious [[ASIN:B008M4MB8K Blade Runner]] vibe?  Farrell goes out to the balcony, cup in hand, just like Decker, to survey the nocturnal metropolis, only Colin is sans shirt and a lot more buff.  And the distinctly Asian feel in all of the street scenes, most of which are dark, and rainy, with Chinese and Japanese characters in neon in the background.  And a couple of times, I swear I was hearing what sounded like the \\"Voight Kampf\\" track from the [[ASIN:B009GEOR9G Vangelis BR soundtrack]].  I guess it's imitative flattery, but it also comes across as unimaginative and derivative.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is perfectly fine escapist fare, attractive actors in cool action bits, with a still-intriguing story line, enhanced by some imaginative tech and good CGI.  But fundamental flaws in physics and tried-n-true Hollywood gimmicks spin it into the dustbin of future history.n Ronny Cox's original Cohaagen, and he didn't get there.

0345536886|4.0|Grisham has never been funnier. Ambulance-chasing (literally!) lawyers Finley and Figg meet young, morally sound young laywer who just quite his $300,000 a year job at a big shot law firm where he toiled night and day with hundreds of others legal rats. The trio take on a big drug company in a can't-lose case. Great stuff with likeable characters. Grisham at his very best. If you've liked anything Grisham has done before, you will love this.
0307592731|2.0|The pages were scarred with ink. The pages were also cut at random sizes. It looks like a book that was rejected for poor quality, but resold anyway. I will be more careful when choosing a books ratings.
B004YXE438|5.0|I wish there were more pictures available. The ones included are spectacular. I am just not done enjoying the process.
B001TH16DI|5.0|great set of DVDs - have been wanting this set since I saw they updated the entire Original Star Trek series
B002QEXNDE|5.0|I have this on CD, vinyl and MP3.  I have to confess the Vinyl version is just a notch below- there is a pop on side one that generates a skip regularly, not from wear but from bass at a high tone-arm level.  Could just be my player, but other albums have been mastered a little better to accommodate for this effect.  That aside, its just wonderful, and certainly doesn't stop me from listening to it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've purchased this game for 3 platforms already (PC, Xbox and Andriod), and I can't wait until PvZ 2 comes out this July.
193700788X|1.0|Very disappointed in the series finale. It was an odd mis-mash of former characters, trying to fit them all in somewhere for the last book. The big romance Eric-Sookie fizzled out in about three pages...very disappointing. If it was going to end, at least end true to character.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great FOTD. played 13 levels and no ads or anything asking me to purchase more so they must have changed that. I almost didn't download because of previous reviews but thankfully they were innacurate yo the current state of the game.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|It's essentially about a mathematician that is suffering from mental illness.  It's alright, the black & white is interesting, although I usually debated about just turning it off and watching something else.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The writing is superb, characters are well written, costumes and great, the 2 story lines are a great attractio. A  must see
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite writers and I wait patiently for each and everyone of her books and she never disappoints a reader.  Her books take you on a journey of murder, mystery, and love.Thank you Mary Higgins Clark for your many contributions to the readers of the world.
0345803485|2.0|The quality of this product was awful, it wasn't acceptable. I love the book itself I am just not happy with the quality the product arrived in.
B00BF124PC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and the perspective that it was written from  I believe it tells a pretty accurate story of what really happened with OBL.  It will fill in a lot of holes about what intelligence work is all about.
B001XUNOSQ|5.0|A fun Saturday night...watching &#34;Happy Feet&#34; with our 5-1/2 granddaughter, who highly recommended this movie.  I am in full agreement!
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|The set arrived timely butone episode was damaged and didnt play. Had to download and watch it on computer. Other than thta, service was fine.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good thinking game. Don'to rush it by using hints. Can't wait for the next one to come out. Worth the money
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am 13 and I love this game it's amazing you should get it I'm on level 14 and I love it
B008K6HN8I|5.0|A really nice file system explorer, definitely worth to have.<br />Lets you browse all four files and install external apks.
B00CPM6PE6|4.0|This series is a dark super hero show that The CW got right!  It's a pretty sweet show and the superhero isn't afraid of killing the bad guys like batman is.  There are attractive ladies on this show and some pretty cool people that help arrow along the way.  I see this show going many... many seasons!  There are a few pitfalls, the lead character gives a certain look every episode and you get sick of the characters constantly chirping out some of the same lines or points they've been trying to make for the last 3 episodes... I find myself saying \\"shut up!\\"  But other then that, the solid writing and premise of the show will be enough to keep me around even though there are so many other good shows out there.  Great job CW!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This movie Fantastic, I have Expendable, now I seeing both movie just I can say the both movies five stars !
B00C0P08CI|5.0|Who knew the Vikings were so dang interesting and full of drama?!  Were the Vikings really so bloodthirsty, yet so interesting?  Haha.  But seriously this is a great show!  After the first couple episodes I thought to myself... \\"ok now what?\\"  It was kind of like finishing a short story, I thought, \\"How are they going to continue this show?\\"  I got my answer: It's great writing and some equally impressive acting.  This show is along the lines of Game of Thrones type show but with much less characters and more action.  Bottom line, it's a show you should be watching or continuing to watch.
B0095P29EG|3.0|The incredible Hulk and Thor are the weakest in the Avengers Franchise, but they aren't bad either.It was a good flick.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This second novel of the trilogy better than the first one.  Although mostly historical, the characters are more fully developed than in the first book.  Since the characters came \\"alive\\" for me,  I really enjoyed this novel and look forward to the third.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|After putting off watching Game of Thrones for quite some time, I'm now kicking myself for waiting so long. I'm completely hooked and cannot recommend the series enough. 10 stars!
B008K9UZY4|4.0|Seven year old twin grandsons loved this game.  There is lots of action and interaction as well.  It keeps their attention and I could hear gales of laughter!!!!
0763644765|3.0|Our first experience with Ms. Patricelli's books was &#34;No No Yes Yes&#34;. By far the best one of hers that I've &#34;read&#34; (Higher and Higher was pretty lame). You don't read these books so much as you make up your own story to go with the cutely drawn pictures.<br /><br />Our twin boys enjoy No No Yes Yes and I feel they will like this one once we start potty training.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is a blast to play. Get it while it's free before they start charging for it.<br />If you have kids they will love it.
0439813786|5.0|I had read this book, from the library, and saw the movie.  I knew I had to have my own edition.  The illustrations are fantastic.  I could just look at those and not read the book.  But the story is wonderful and I just loved it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good minus some lag but once it runs smoothly it plays well<br />But other than that it's pretty great and nothing to lose its free
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The attention to details. Found it to be very interesting in the creative thinking the character of the story used to get out of his many difficulties.
B00000273M|5.0|Great cd if you love the Bangles music.  Has most of the hits that you love to listen to anytime
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much csi activities and great story line. I would recommend this book to anyone that is hooked on CSI programs.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|like all thermal paste, not much is in the tube.  press slowly and use sparingly.  it does the job well.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Fascinating perspective that had me wanting to review Shakespeare, Machievelli, Hedonism, Epicureanism and more while reading this book. Thought provoking, and an inspiring story of a man who valued early writings, what his world and challenges may have been.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case looks nice, is inexpensive, protects the Kindle, stands in various positions and best of all is vegan friendly, perfect! Don't waste your money on anything else
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Though I read Hunger games last summer, I recently read Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  I thoroughly enjoyed Catching Fire, but found Mockingjay a bit disappointing. It's still worth worth reading to complete the trilogy though.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I usually read only Christian fiction but couldn't find anything that weekend to hold my attention.  This is your regular Nicholas Sparks but it was entertaining and I actually finished it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This is a solid film with good acting that offers a new perspective on how society reacts to mental illness.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|- i understand the need for revenue and therefore ads  - but I stopped playing after a while and dont mind... so I deleted it because it was too intrusive and i dont think it is worth buying a game like this.  The game itself gets 4 stars, the complete inundation of ads drops it to 3 and loses my business.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare really knowa how to pull at your heartstrings!!! This third book of the series does not dissapoint!!! It was so amazing! I have already almost finished book 4! I will be sad to have to wait for the sixth one to come out! This is a mustread series!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything you would expect from the best written show on the air. Have purchased season 3 and completely enjoying it also.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|High quality production and very good acting.  Toward the end, of Season 2, however, the storyline started to feel more like a soap opera than a classic story of rich and poor.  I didn't have that feeling during Season 1.  But overall, it was great.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is a great case for the kindle hd. It keeps it safe and the leather is soooo soft. Itputs my kindle to sleep when shut and wakes it up when you open it. Can't ask for more
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Use it on kindle fire HD. Really useful to review how much juice left. Would recommend to all kindle addicts
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I might as well just keep my kindle on the charger for this one. Once you start you just do not want to put it down andyou sure do not want it topower down in the middle of the game.
B000FA5STS|1.0|This book has really disappointed. David's books are getting harder and harder to read...The bad language is way to frequent. I use to be able to read around the words..that is happening less & less for me. In this book the more u got into the story line the worse it got....come on Terri Blackstone & Liz Wielh can write a really good book w/o the bad language..So can you, David...
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is probably the most twisted, effed up book I've ever read, but I couldn't stop reading it! It was very well written and I would definitely recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This games is so much fun if you don't watch it you can find yourself addicted loved the first one and this one as well
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Its a very good movie, with a very good actor.  The 3D was great, but I think it could have been just a little bit better.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|American History X is a great film with a stellar performance by Edward Norton. (He really should have won the Oscar.) The take-away of the movie was &#34;Life is too short to be hateful.&#34; and is something that can resonant with anyone despite the discomfort some might feel about the racism portrayed. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is not a comfortable movie to watch but it is one worth watching.
B009QU9X44|5.0|Half way through it and I just love it as much as Half of a Yellow Sun. Can't put it down! what a clever account of social dislocation and what a picture of the American and European ignorance towards &#34;the other&#34;
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I think she is a charming talented lady.  Lovely voice - reminds me of past years when performers truly had talent.  Also loved the musical selection - again the classics of popular music.  I am interested in finding whether Emmy Rossum has any other CD's.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is awesome! I am on season 3 and still loving it! I wish there are more shows like this on American television today. One that shows moral values, friendships, honesty and good old family values.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Beautiful print, great story, great music, great cast.<br />The film holds it's own with any of today's bigger, splashier musical films.<br />Choreographer/director Bob Fosse took the award winning musical stage production and successfully expanded  it for film.<br />All the musical numbers take place within the cabaret setting so, none of the cast members suddenly burst into song on a city street  ala' movie musicals such as the classic \\" West Side Story.\\"<br />However, be fairly warned.<br />\\"Cabaret\\", while entertaining and enjoyable, is not a \\"feel good\\" movie musical.<br />The story  is perhaps best described as bitter-sweet.<br />It's a love story to be certain but also the tragic tale of Nazi Germany's rise to power.<br />An original premise to say the least.<br />And incredibly entertaining.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works great with my Kenwood TS-2000.  I have had others cheaper but always had problems getting them to install this one you will not have that problem and it is made to last.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|So it might've just been me but when I opened the app, it runned great for a moment then stopped! I have a Kindle Fire HD 8' 9'. All my other apps work fine, I have Doodle Devil but this app just wont work so basicly I just wasted my money and I'd like it back.<br /><br />Read the reviews before you get this game. It might save you 99 cents.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Gripping tear jerker movie almost impossible to believe that it is true what so many people went through we should value life even more
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This one is one of the best debuts EVER!!!!! The Bon Scott years are AMAZING, and HIGH VOLTAGE got a lot of ROCK pearls like IT´s A LONG WAY TO THE TOP(CLASSIC!!!), ROCK N ROLL SINGER, TNT, LIVE WIRE and the title track!!!!!!!AMAZING ROCK N ROLL!!!!!!!!!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The arrangements are simple and a tribute to the times, but his lyrics are deeply poetic - many about inner city life - and while that's not part of my own experience, they're edge speak to me, nonetheless.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great service, good movie for the price. Thanks. A+++++ This dealer has great deals at all times. You cannot go wrong!!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I love his prose - his poetry runs deep and the music itself reminds me of my roots in the 70's.  The arrangements on this album are notably more sophisticated than his first, Cold Fact.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|...and it took about 4 listens for me to begin to \\"get it\\", and as another reviewer said, It now seems I'm finding a new favorite on every listen.<br /><br />If you liked the Heartbreak Station or (vastly underrated, in my opinion) Still Climbing albums, you won't be disappointed in this at all.<br /><br />In a nutshell: Just buy it.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|This was my sister's favorite movie when we were little. Bought it for her birthday haven't opened it yet. Comes with blue ray, DVD, jewlery box, and a sound track. I think there may be more things in there as well.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I passed some of my most trying years watching Veronica Mars. I knew that I loved it then, but I was a bit skeptical that I would still enjoy it.  Despite the haircuts and clothing that make it seem a little dated, I was very engaged watching it the second time around--even though I remembered most of the plot lines from before.  If you are ever in the mood for some girl power Kristen Bell gives it up.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Mahhjong is my all-time favourite game to play.<br />All variations are are a welcome challenge to me. I never feel better than when I overcome one more obstacle.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|When I saw the reviews in the theater for this, It did not appear to me.  Sounded like a strange premise.  However, on a trip my 32 year old son grabbed it from Red Box for a movie night. We all enjoyed.  We have since rented it from Amazon to show other family members.  it is well written, well acted, beautiful scenery, and caring people.  The main characters develop and change in a very positive way and their goal is to serve humanity.  Good goal.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's a compelling story which I'm glad was published for everyone to know. It chronicles not only the merciful event on December 20, 1943, but also relates the fascinating events of each of the main pilots leading up to and after that date. Also impressed with author's skill. Very easy to read writing style. Very informative, and I liked how most of the facts were cited to specific sources, adding to the books authenticity as a true story
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This was a pretty lackluster ending to what had been a good trilogy. There were too many characters to keep up with, and there wasn't enough development to make you care about each of them.  The love triangle was beyond forced and Lena never seemed that devoted to either one.<br /><br />I liked the portions of the story told from Hana's point of view. I found myself wishing there was a whole series devoted to that dynamic.<br /><br />Finally, the cursing in this book was way too over the top. I don't mind some used for appropriate dramatic effect, but this felt like a substitute for good writing. Her editor should have insisted she write the characters to better dramatic effect rather than just have them drop an F-bomb everytime they're upset.
0142405809|4.0|My 3-year-old son and I like this book, but like others said - it would be more interesting if they would've put in more details and fun info about the different places the snail and whale visit.  Just kind of mentions that they go around the world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is perfect if any wait for enderman. Boy all the joys in this game don't bring you down when I'm bored I know what to do.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Fun for children and adults alike!  I wouldn't typically watch a movie like this but my 12 year old son begged me and I caved in...glad I did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so good that after I read it I listened to it and it made the book even better. It's such a deep look into relationships of resentment, manipulation, and eventual love and understanding. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Movie degraded briefly, paused to reload but upon clicking play again it restored to normal quality. Overall pretty good movie.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Love it
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It's amazing how mature the story was even at that time , just a joy to watch. Recommended for all Sci Fi fans.
B003R4ZMJU|2.0|It does NOT have spanish subtitles. It could be better with that. Please bring it to the market an edition with spanish subtitles
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Great story, a little slow in the middle but looking forward to the next one in the 10 book series.  I'd be hard pressed to find a Sanderson novel that wasn't well written.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Love the serie. It is perfect, the DVD is ok well done well packed. I love The Vampire Diaries forever and ever.
1848507836|4.0|This book is a incredible journey that inlists many powerful thoughts and reflection.  I would recommend this book to any seeker of spiritual knowledge who's mind is open to inspect and reflect on new ideas and possibilities. God's mansions are many and this door which the author opened might just be one of those.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Love the movie. It is perfect, the DVD is ok well done well packed. I love hollywood forever and ever.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|It's high quality hot sweaty beefcake. What's not to love?<br /><br />The digital download is a joke though. You can only view it in a specific program, not just the movie to put it on devices if you want to.

B00BT0ZS52|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but I didn't go to the theater. I thought there would be this amazing metaphysical thread to follow but instead it was a mish-mush of harshly edited cuts from one story to the another. Despite the obvious connections made, it lacked any feeling about it. And that ...be the true true!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It took me a little while to get into it as I felt it hard to follow.  I am so happy that I stuck with it as I really enjoyed.  Enjoyed learning all the meanings of  the flowers.  That is were a real book in my positions would help me.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Husband didn't care for it, but i liked it. :)<br />Not as funny as the trailers though.<br />Would've liked to see more of Chris Tucker.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kevin Bacon is fantastic in his tortured portrayal of Ryan; James Purefoy performance is spot on. Can't wait to see what's next!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I love this movie! And I know that &#34;We shall not steal what does not belong to us&#34; but, I looked at how they all worked together to get what they wanted. Except the one guy that set them up and stole all the gold for himself... which eventually, he lost out in the end of not having his share of the gold.

B0021L8V0M|5.0|I love this movie! I am an Angelie Jolie fan! She did an excellent job in handling those who got in her way! I perceive her as a powerful actor and she the type of woman that a lot of young women would love to become.

0785168109|1.0|It would be far too easy to go into some self-appreciating review of the movie and how it ruined my life because \\"they\\" got this, that or the other wrong in what I suppose to be the correct interpretation of said idea, but I won't.<br />Instead, I will focus on the book: \\"The Art of Iron Man 3.\\"<br />With that said, a little background on how and why I got the book.<br />Tony Stark has always been a character that I felt I could relate to.<br />Growing up on an Indian reservation in Oklahoma, I never knew my mom, but I was fortunate to be raised by my dad. He considered himself a bit of an engineering genius. He worked at Jiffy Lube until I was six when he was fired for his inebriated candid conversation about the tricks of the trade ripping off customers to a undercover local news team of investigative reporters from the reservation's two-year college annex media program.<br />After that, being a Native American, he collected his welfare checks from the government which generously surpassed what he was making actually holding a job. He felt his time could be more effectively used to develope his engineering skills when he wasn't drunk or passed out for days at a time. One of the crowning achievements was the iCheese Radio that he hoped to sell one day. Much like a potato, he was able to power a radio from a block of government cheese. He tried other cheeses, but he only had success with the government cheeses that were issued to him every other Thursday.<br />He died shortly after that during a microwave Cheeze Wiz accident that destroyed our trailer.<br />Hoping the apple had fallen close to the tree, I too picked up drinking and inventing at the age of eight.<br />Some of my ideas usually ended up with me staying at the clinic on the reservation for a week and only attending school for a few weeks each year. I  built upon the hovercraft design using a vacuum cleaner engine like the specifications from 'Boys Life' magazine. By attaching an extention cord to a series of car batteries on a Radio Flyer wagon, I ended up setting a corn field on fire that burned to death some migrant workers living in the corn field. My hovercraft crashed into the car the sheriff was sleeping in and I ended up spending one night in a juveneile detention center.<br />Prison life hardened me and I became angry. It was there as the social worker drove me home after stopping for ice cream at the mini golf indian family fun center taco buffet casino that I decided to use my engineering skills for my own personal gain.<br />Fast forward a few years and some Iron Man films later, I have long-awaited this art book to provide a plethora of schematics for me to start building my own personal Iron Man suit from.<br />This is where the \\"art of\\" book fails me.<br />It's nothing more than a hodgepodge of Iron Man suits, props, enviroments, character designs and long-winded nonsensical jib jab to sell more comic books and action figures. Most of the suits do not even make it into the movie and what you do see in the movie have very little screen time.<br />None of that helps me other than  The Mandarin. His costume designs were brilliant. A definite highlight of the movie even though barely covered in the book.es of car batteries on a Radio Flyer wagon, I ended up setting a corn field on fire that burned to death some migrant workers living in the corn field.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It is one of the best there is Creative with  everything and your able to and stuff there is also survival witch is more for people who like a little more challenging games first you start off with nothing and end with good stuff like armour and diamonds went to a place called nether that lets you get a bunch of stuff also there is zombie pigman who attack you there and there is awesome updates so keep an I out
B008YU0AOE|5.0|So easy to use love the big buttons especially because I have to always wear my glasses.. I really enjoy using this
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like this one especially the stacked games.  I have several variations of Mahjong and this is my current favorite.[[ASIN:B006M4F67A 247 Mahjong]]

B005NPCUC8|1.0|Maybe you need to be high or something to really enjoy this album, but it just didn't do it for me.  I've never necessarily been a huge Pink Floyd fan, but I just don't get what all the fuss is about this album.  Glad I got it as a really cheap download for only $2.99.
B000002LQR|5.0|I have been a fan of this album/band and lost my old cd.So I came to Amazon to look for a new one.I found a replacement for my old one in great shape and at a great price!!!Thanks..
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of creepy shows, but this one is the creepiest yet.  I almost don't want to be alone to watch it!
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|My 14 year old daughter and 8 year old son love this, and have it in their regular watch rotation.  The idea that the fabeled Santa, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny team up with Jack Frost to take on &#34;The Boogie Man&#34; is a great plot line.  It is well executed, fast paced and packs a few great lessons in along the way (Jack Frost needs to find out what he really believes in so that he can realize his true potential and the kids are taught that believing in somebody helps them succeed...a great lesson for business, leaderships and relationships!).  I recommend this as a great family movie.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|It is getting too dark these Scarpetta novels. Too many dark, silent thoughts, too many dark characters to really enjoy.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Having read some of the Jack Reacher novels, I am well aware that Tom Cruise was miscast as the title character, described as the suze of an NFL football player.  However, he proves again what a great actor he is by making the role his own and pretty soon you forget all about the differences in the character in the book and the one on the screen.  The biting humor is there, just like in the book.  A great, action packed movie!!
B000VWE5OY|3.0|I just finished watching the first season of Torchwood, and I'd give it a C+. The characters are pretty good, and the Torchwood station is phenomenal. Also, the aliens are well done. But there are some major drawbacks: too much sex, for one thing. I'm no prude, but all the casual hooking up just detracts from the story line. Also, the fact that Captain Jack is gay is sort of shoved in the viewers' faces repeatedly. We get it, he's gay! Can we move on? The episodes themselves range from excellent to \\"meh.\\" I was either watching breathlessly or stopping after 10 minutes to go to the next episode. Also, the Owen character seems to sort of go off the rails as the season progresses, which is distracting. The fact that Gwen is cheating on her live-in boyfriend with Owen is again something that just pulls you out of the story. I think if the producers and writers concentrate on aliens and spend less time on the humans' sex lives, this could be a very good show.
1451695195|5.0|I'm a science/history TV, book sort of guy, not so much a drama or comedy type.  This book made life after death and all those theories by quantum physicists, theoretical physicists, and cosmologists make a lot more sense.  I'm not a scientist.  I have degrees in engineering, theology, and counseling.  I'm glad I read this book as my entry into the Near Death Experience genre.  I have terminal cancer, am not actively religious, and this book kicked me into growing in my perception/understanding of life after death.
B002P5XXR0|3.0|This is one of those movie soundtracks that specifically fits the movie so closely, had you not seen the movie, the soundtrack would make no sense at all. All I could think of while listening to it was the soundtrack to the original &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34; movie from back in 1971 or so. That too would make no sense had you not seen the movie, yet having seen the movie one would relive every part upon hearing the music once again. Be very conscious of the volume changes as it gets very low, one then turns their system up and then gets blown out when the sound comes back to full double or triple forte volume. Unlike many of my soundtracks, this will be one I will listen to only rarely, thus the three star rating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love both modes.  Creative mode is fun because you can almost build anything.  Survival mode is fun because it's challenging.  One bad thing is that i can't figure out how to make a bed on Survival mode.  Otherwise I think it is totally worth the money!!!  If your reading this then I tell you to buy it!  You will not regret it.
B00BT0ZS52|4.0|It was a good movie. Its was not really that sci fi though just a bunch of stories happening in different time periods.The actors made this movie by playing varied roles and playing them well.
B007V65R54|5.0|I've been hearing about Silver and if anything, he has not  been praised enough. I'm interested not only for what he says but also the way he says it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|In was a fitting end to the series. Charlaine Harris wrote she ended it like she planned to do from the beginning, good for us. I have enjoyed everyone of the Skokie Stackhouse books and this one as much. It was a fun and exciting read. True to the characters and  to the story.
630471193X|1.0|I bought this movie for someone else. While the movie is a great one. This disc was not playable. It was scratched. The case looked like it lived in the car.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Great app.  I am on the road all day and its nice to plug this in and hear updates from other drivers.  I was going down a back country road, very bendy, and got a warning that there was an object in the road ahead.  Sure enough someone had lost a load off a truck around a blind curve.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoyed viewing this series especially since I missed some of them.  Recommended for all friends and adult family members.  Once you start you want to see the next episode for sure.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Thought the ending was going to be really stupid, but it turned out to be ok.  Other than that, the beginning and middle was interesting and holds a certain promise for better things to come.  The one part that was really corny was the Matrix like scene where he's standing in a whitefield like Neo staring at the camera. It would have been cooler to have 216 random numbers floating around his head but everyone's a critic right?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A really fun soap opera with a British accent.  The scenery alone is worth the price.  The fact that the actors are very good is a plus, too.  Can't wait for season four.
0425263916|5.0|I have never read a book this fast because I couldn't put it down.  Luckily, I had bought the second book in the series at the same time.  I read both books in less than 3 days.  I didn't ready 50 Shades that fast.  Story line is great, characters are interesting.  You don't want to put it down for a second.  Can't wait till the next one is released.  Sylvia Day, &#34;ROCKS!&#34;
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had watched the movie first, which I'm glad I did because it was different from the book. I'm glad I read the book because it gives you more in depth about the relationships than the movie does. Fast read too. Didn't take long at all to get interested and not be able to put it down.
0425263908|5.0|I have never read a two books this fast because I couldn't put it down.  Luckily, I had bought the second book in the series at the same time.  I read both books in less than 3 days.

B001TODCII|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie,  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Looking forward to seeing the sequel!
B003G8Y4QO|3.0|Lousy transition into a new regenerated doctor. Matt Smith just doesn't garner the same level of enthusiasm as David Tennant.
B0034G4P94|4.0|I thought the acting was great but there were many parts that were predictable, but that won't stop me from watching it again and again and again :)
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I will always love this book.  A true classic, with a happily ever after ending.  And you can't beat the price.
B008H08XW2|5.0|I love Maroon 5.  I've seen them twice in concert.  This album is just as great as the other ones I own.
1932100660|4.0|This book has opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about meat and the way the American diet is ruining our health.  I think everyone should read this book!
B00454U1NS|5.0|This is a great album.  I've seen Pink in concert and she is fabulous.  The album has all of her great songs on them.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it wakes ma up on time. Also you can exactly how many hours the the next alarm will go off. I love this app &lt;3
B005ZMUWWY|4.0|This was a fun story of how a lonely robot that did his job everyday (like most of us) for seven hundred years finds love with nothing more then his good looks , and the will to live
B006MW3UZW|5.0|acting is exceptional, sets are as they should be for the period. Wonderful series especially for older adults or anybody interested in history.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|hated it from the beginning. had to download maps and only worked with wifi connection.  uninstalled after two days! never again~
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great way to comunicate and keep in touch, and find friends.  also love the cat and dog pictures and different way to find things
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My family loves this show and it is so easy to get hooked in. It will not disappoint. Glad the show keeps in touch with some of the other past employees. Good story lines and great period piece.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|OMG this is the best movie ever. Pure action with blood from the beginning to the end be prepared to be on the edge of your seat.
B000I186FW|5.0|I just liked the mystery of V.  I've seen it two times now and learn something new I missed in previous screenings.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is one of the few stories where I wanted to root for the bad guy, I'll leave it at that. But the story mostly follows Faber &#34;The Needle&#34;, who is a German Spy during World War II. Ken Follet manages to show what should be a despicable person, his human side. Faber has 2 sides to him... he has the professional spy/assassin side of him where he is cruel, cold-blooded, calculated killer. On the other side you get to see Faber's human side where he longs to go back home and get back to a normal life and possibly settle down with a wife. I higly recommend this book, it may be somewhat old but in my opinion it is a classic.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I think that you should start people out with more than 40 coins because they go fast when you don't know how to play it. Then you have to wait 30 seconds for another coin. too much time wasted waiting. Start to lose interest.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Recommend this CD  music of the great Andrea Boccelli's concert from Portofino, Italy. Enjoy with friends and family and a good Italian Dinner and candlelight. Great gift for men or  women with a love for beautiful music.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I have enjoyed season 1 of Vikings.  It has been very entertaining.  I enjoyed the cast, cinematography, plot, and music.  I am eager to watch Season 2.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|EVERY ON HAS TO GET THIS SOUNDTRACK. IT IS SO ENJOYABLE AND ENTERTAINING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAD SEEN THE MOVIE RECENTLY..
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|maybe, if its possible, add more dictionaries to the spanish and portuguese bundle to improve the basic software in order to get better public
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Loved this album, great selectionsl and the price cannot be beat. I shopped around and got the best price on Amazon.com for all my CD needs.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|ok I know this app is for little kids but it sounded interesting so I downloaded it. I am fourteen and so far this is my favorite app on my kindle.  you should take my word for it too because this is probably only the second time I have rated an app and I have had my kindle for more than two years with over  one hundred apps downloaded
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise was good. The action is good. The suspense is not bad either. You can narrow down some of the mystery fairly easily but the movie still is not bad and worth watching. Cruise may be strange in real life, but his acting is definitely good.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  The trailers presented it as being your typical alien attack movie, but the dynamic between the soldiers in the unit, their relationships with each other and reactions to the new Staff Sergeant in their unit, and the squad's interactions with the civilians they're charged to protect is what made the movie work.
B000003TAR|4.0|The members of Nirvana were so caught off guard at the explosive success of \\"Nevermind\\" that it took them three years to record the follow-up. They were even quoted as saying they wanted to make an anti-nevermind to shed some of their fans who looked at the band (and in particular, Kurt Cobain) as movement leaders. \\"In Utero\\" was somewhat successful at that attempt, as it is possibly one of the loudest and most distorted albums recorded by a major rockstar band. Producer Steve Albini's original production was so harsh that the record company demanded a remix, which was done when the masters were turned over to REM producer Scott Litt, who remixed them under the title of \\"additional engineering.\\"<br /><br />But even he couldn't smooth out the roughest edges of \\"In Utero.\\" The band got its initial wish as well. \\"In Utero\\" was selling on a slower pace than \\"Nevermind\\" was until Cobain decided addiction, success and depression were too much for him and he ended his own life. That act reignited the sales of \\"In Utero\\" and the whole Cobain as spokesman of a generation rage. His suicide still doesn't detract from the album's strengths and flaws. Cobain was a unique songwriter, in that his style of 'soft-loud-soft-screech' version of verse-chorus-verse altered songwriting for a whole generation of acts. And when he was on, he was stunning. There's no denying the power of \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" and \\"Dumb\\" or the depth of the haunting \\"All Apologies.\\" Drummer Dave Grohl was the feistiest drummer in a long line of skinpounders, and bassist Kirst Novoselic held the bottom together in the midst of all the chaos.<br /><br />At the same time, the album's flaws are glaring. The intentional dissonance can sometimes get in the way of the band (like on \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" which sounds like a slam against the record company's insistence on getting another \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\") or the crash and burn howling on \\"Scentless Apprentice.\\" But when you consider that this was the kind of Stooges' \\"Raw Power\\" approach Nirvana was aiming for, it's pretty amazing that they got away with it. Also, given that the music was essentially Cobain's suicide note to the world, it cemented \\"In Utero\\" as a riveting punctuation point to the end of Nirvana's lifespan.ind of Stooges' \\"Raw Power\\" approach Nirvana was aiming for, it's pretty amazing that they got away with it.

B00BHU261S|4.0|I wanted to see this film since I heard about it. I was not available in my area at the movie theater so this was great. It was funny yet realistic. I really enjoyed it. With this cast how could you not!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy the graphics and timed searches. I'm not much for the extra play options like adding friends. I do get frustrated with the energy loss and my impatience with figuring out how to get more diamonds, but it is perfect for short games occasionally
B0000640S2|2.0|I already had Rambo first blood and Rambo 3. The DVD case matches the other two in the set but it is not a true two disk like it describes.  It is one disc with 2 sides.(wide screen & full screen). The other two movies have two DVDs with movie artwork on the non play side.
030796664X|4.0|Not a self-help book. This book reviews who, what, where, and when of habits and forming habits. The examples in the book highlight the discovery and science of habits. The book was easy to follow in the audiobook edition I borrowed from the local library. The author's explanations and conclusions of habit and habit forming were interested and fact based.<br /><br />A fun nonfiction read if you're interesting in understanding someone's thoughts on the human mechanism of habits.
B004L5GYCI|5.0|A very nice respite from the &#34;crash and burn&#34;, &#34;teenagers save the world from alien&#34;, &#34;vampires suck blood&#34; and &#34;carhops in bondage&#34; movies that Hollywood grinds out daily.  Bought this movie for friends as well as myself.  It's sensitive and thought provoking and I don't feel beat up after watching it.  The actual lighting is a little dark for my taste, but that's my only complaint - camerawork.  All the rest is very positive.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Love this movie, its my son's favorite and we had it on vhs and wanted to own it on dvd. Highly recommended.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie tends to present an opposite view of how Slavery really was, with however,  a wonderful ending that says in short WE WON'T GO BACK TO THE WAY WE WERE!!!!!!!!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|My grandma loves this cd, she listens to it all the time and says its just beautiful, one of his best cds ever.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|It goes to show that animals will submit for the sake of survival.  But GOD gave us a choice to adjust, protect, and learn how to deal with the unknown.
193700788X|5.0|OK, no spoilers here.  Except to say my wife who is a faithful reader was thrilled with the book and the ending.  She does not agree at all with the negative reviews.  Rather, this was one of the best books in the series and a fitting ending.  After pre-purchasing the book for Mother's Day, then reading all the negative reviews, I was afraid my wife would be disappointed.  Not at all!  She really liked it.  Enjoy the book!  In fact, anyone who has read the series would not at all be taken by surprise by the ending.  For those who criticize the book, well, to each his or her own....
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I had to watch this movie for my developmental psychology. I must say that for me as a student I was really impressed how all the stages of development where clearly stated in this movie. Plus the love between Daisy and Benjamin was so inspiring even though they just passed through time. Very lovely movie. I would watch it again
0142427837|5.0|Stephen King does it again,but this time it's not horror . Like the Shawshank Redemption the Long Walk focuses on one central character.  The Walk is set in an alternate America . All the &#34;boys&#34; have  volunteered for the Walk . The prize,anything in the world you want. This book almost reminds me of a right of passage  . You would think a book about a bunch of men walking would be boring,but the story draws you in & makes you really care about the characters. I sat there reading this ,rooting for the main character.  Afterwords I wondered why! But that's Stephen Kings way. His depth of the characters is amazing.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Easy to assemble--and I am a total klutz. Have already used with several bottles with no problems. Would recommend for sure.
0240808452|4.0|I'm not used to writing reviews, but I didn't want to miss this opportunity to express how much I enjoyed the book and the one thing I think it could be improved.<br /><br />What this book IS: The book is a comprehensive guide on how to approach the human figure in a different way. Focusing on motion and how to create a more dynamic and forceful drawing. It deals with line, perspective (applied to the figure) and even a little bit of clothing and folds.<br /><br />What this book IS NOT: This is not your typical &#34;how to draw the human figure book&#34;. It doesn't deal with the classical figure height measured in heads and neither is a book to learn anatomy at all. For that kind of reading I would suggest something on the likes of Andrew Loomis or even Human Anatomy for Artists from András Szunyoghy.<br /><br />The binding, sadly, is another deal. You have to handle this book with a lot of care if you want it to last. I'm not used to leaving books laying around but I certainly would like being able to have it opened close to me while drawing to better apply some of it's concepts. This is not possible, as you can hear the binding slowly &#34;cracking&#34; and after little use I had to use a bit of glue to prevent some pages from detaching.<br /><br />Overall, an amazing and unique book that would seriously benefit from a better binding, which is the only reason why I didn't give it five stars.
193700788X|4.0|I enjoyed Dead Ever After for what it was- a final farewell to Sookie Stackhouse. The readers got to see all the characters one last time to say goodbyes and prepare to move on. Some of the character motivation could have been stronger but overall I put down the book satisfied and content.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Sorry they never continued it. Had great potential, yet they still left an opening for a continuation or sequal or even a movie with that end of the 2nd  season.  They just need to realize that you can't keep repeating the first SG 1 series and expect the same end results.  A little more creative effort guys and a little less on the battles. You can't maintain a series with constant attacks on the Destiny.
1612191290|2.0|Skilfully written treatise, but it should have remained an article. It is quite true that many economists pay too much attention to money as a medium of exchange and not to money as a store of value (therefore debt). Yet there is no logical link between this finding and the state theory of money as Graeber would have it. Once he reveals himself as stalwart chartalist, even quoting Friedrich Knapp, the book deteriorates. I am looking forward to the moment when someone without deeply felt hate for capitalism tries to develop the same initial assumption of money being identical to credit.
B001TKD4ZI|3.0|Kerrelyn Sparks is not the best writer. Characters like Roman and Shanna are not one of those phenomenal personalities whose story sticks with you. In fact, the story when you read it won't even be worth remembering. The book is riddled with neo-vamp cliches, like Roman being the stereotypical neo-Vamp that believes himself to be a monster beyond redemption.<br /><br />The book, however, is a fun read. If you have the time and like this kind of book, I encourage you, to sit down, to buy it, and enjoy reading it. What Sparks lacks in imagination and technical skill she makes up for with humor. This book is a light-hearted and humorous &#34;fun read.&#34; Overall it's worth the time to read.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|it is a book that will make you think and will make you laugh so hard..Once I got into it , I could not put it down.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love the Games G5 puts out. Dark Arcana was fun to play as well as challenging. Looking forward to finishing Abyss
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I've played this game a couple of times and found it entertaining.  I highly recommend it as it has enough difficulty to make it a challenge.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I believe each album Demi Lovato has released has each grown and grown more mature and more intimate. She opens a lot more in this cd about having a troubled past and I think maybe that's why this album is her best so far. Her voice is easily one of the best out there in the music business because hers is so real and so genuine and she puts so much feeling into the songs she sings and the songs she writes. I personally believe this is her best album she has yet to release if you were satisfied with Unbroken I know for a fact that you will love this album even more.
B00009W0U4|3.0|I haven't been able to finish this movie to tell you the truth. It's quite an intricate story but it doesn't keep me grasped to my chair and I end up loosing interest. I don't really understand it.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This book was interesting and full of twists and turns.  I think I like the TV show BONES better.  The character Bones in the book is totally different than the Bones on TV.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I think it's probably the best show on tv.  Great acting, story lines and that it all takes place in Georgia and not on a set.
B005XUC398|2.0|The language was very offensive to us. The plot was shallow and indicative of society's mindset today. The actors' character traits did not portray what I would want to teach anyone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It's was a very touching book, an amazing story about perseverance and love, told from the viewpoint of a dog, which is an interesting twist.
0525952926|5.0|I love the writing of Ken Follett and now can not wait for the next and last chapter in this his latest offering.
B000LJ9ZWE|5.0|A must watch, after seeing it again after 25+ yrs it was obvious that many movies since have copied the themes and format of this movie, Terminator, iRobot, to name a few...
B000FC2KL0|3.0|Weird story but true. Towards the end, the whole sobriety thing permitted a bit much. But I am still a Huge Chilli Peppers fan. Glad you came back from the dark side Anthony. Peace.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|\\"Watchmen\\" blew me away when it 1st came out.  It retained its power when it was then released as a single-issue graphic novel.  Along with Frank Miller's '86 \\"Dark Knight\\", \\"Watchmen\\" was a real game-changer for the genre. If you haven't read it, but saw the movie: Don't judge a book by its poorer screen adaptation! This is definitely worth reading...a few times.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|I'm very critical of &#34;true stories&#34; that come from Hollywood, but, they did a nice job on this one! Very simply done and well acted.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I read it immediately after finishing Born to Run, and both really have me wanting to run an Ultra! This book kept my interest the entire time and the recipes look great, I can't wait to try some. I def recommend this book to runners and I non-runners alike!
B00CM96A60|5.0|Armin van Buuren is the #1 DJ in the world and I would rate this up there as one of his best albums to date.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. i was happy it was not overly scary. The ending was unexpected. I wonder if there will be a sequel.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly fans already know.  For the uninitiated, if you like adventure, tongue-in-cheek irony, and real, flawed, human beings forging a community, this is the show for you.  If you are just into cool special effects and shoot outs, there's plenty of that for you too.  If you grew up with Bonanza and The Big Valley, there's plenty of Western drama thrown in as well.  Who couldn't love a show like this... other than mindless Fox Network executive drones... Perhaps a new supply of Torgo's Executive Powder is in order!!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|If you like crap, you'll LOVE this book.  I had a total crap-gasm while reading it.  It was super craptastic.  I highly suggest this book to those suffering from constipation - if you need crap, this book has plenty of it!
B009AMAJPA|1.0|Film is in AC-3 format, really?  No aspect ratio given in the description, really?<br /><br />Film drags in the beginning and then gets to the over the top action sequences. If the action sequences look unbelievable then the film has no merit with me, it becomes a joke. You would think with the special effects technology they have now a days they would be more realistic action sequences but instead they go the other way with them and make them so much over the top, if that's what the audiences want to see then fine but for me it just insults me and then the movie falls under a different genre, it become's a comedy...  $20.00 plus dollars for this film, that's about $15.00 to much. This belongs in the Walmart $5.00 dollar bin with a reduction sticker telling the buyer they can get an additional $1.00 off at the register.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I  just do not get any of this system and all this garbage. I think it is time to forget all this and<br />Call on a phone to communicate every . That is a lot easier than  this.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game out there! I never miss a day playing this game.<br />Developers are doing a great job.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Every actor in this entire season is awesome, including even those with the smallest of roles.  Great TV show and the whole season is really entertaining.  Easily my new favorite show.  Thanks Amazon for offering this.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed the book and read it to the very end.<br /><br />It mixes history with political analysis and also sprinkles in a great deal of humanity.<br /><br />I'm 57 and I learned a lot from this story. I'm from a conservative mid-western ancestry of farmers and small business owners. I'm not a good Republican, but I'm right of center.<br /><br />I never realized that people associated capitalism with monarchies. I always thought of capitalism as the most efficient way to create wealth.<br /><br />I was never really concerned about how Inheritance affects the distribution of wealth. I guess I kind of presumed that rich people with dull kids could count on the kids losing their money eventually, so what is the problem?  Here I see Czar Nicolas as a bumbling fool who basically could have saved 10 million deaths, but was totally clueless. He should never have had the power he was given. He should never have inherited the power he did. There were a dozen more princes and politicians to share this failure with Nicolas.<br /><br />After reading this book, I see that inheritance is a critical issue today as it was 100 years ago. Is most of the wealth of the 1% inherited? I'd guess yes.<br /><br />I said I was not a good Republican. Part of that is that I believe everyone should have to compete, rich and poor alike. This means I have no qualms about heavy inheritance taxes. I good Republican would rail against the 'Death Tax', but I think we would be much better off severely limiting what a person can inherit, less we trap enormous resources in the hands of incompetent offspring.<br /><br />Easy for me to say while I am not likely to inherit or pass on any wealth, but this book really spells out why Inheritance (not Capitalism) is a scourge to society.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Always saw coming attraction but never bothered to watch show. watched the pilot, finished the 3 seasons in a few days.this show covers all my character expectations and depth of these characters. Everything about each show is set to almost make sure you watch the next airing! SOME BODY OF WORK! Hat's off to the writers, Hat's off to Prime!!!
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|Easy to use and install! Automaticly download all my music files. Lots of options plus intresting upgrades for more functionality
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Yeah, yeah, it's been said before, but Veronica Mars is a modern day Nancy Drew.  I wish VM had been around when I was a kid; my middle school years might have been different.  I am very much an adult, and I still want to grow up to be her.<br /><br />I am not going to do a great big plot analysis as it's been done, but the writing is witty, dry, and snappy; the story arc is impeccable, and some pretty good acting.  Heck, it has Enrico Colantino and the incredibly adorable Kristen Bell.  Not to mention Jason Dohring, a best bad boy.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Hard to get into at first when you do your in it for good recommend this to people to wacth
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is head and shoulders above the old Google reader. Fun to use and maneuver with great graphics. Great app.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|A story that even as a Jewish person never read as a teen. Really happy I came across it and gave it a try.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This movie almost has the potential to become a classic, but while I rated it a 4 star ...it isn't a magnificent or otherwise stunning movie. It is a damn good movie that delivers the goods.
B000YDIA00|5.0|it is a perfect boot that my hus love it so much.<br /><br />size is perfect and the style is perfet. also reasonable price
B008220DGE|2.0|I found little, if any, entertainment value in this movie, but if you select movies based on their weirdness factor, this may be for you. Characters that make you cringe, but somehow you can't always look away. Master is the leader of a group/cult that believes in \\"processing\\" past lives. The fact that it's set just after WWII shows a side different side of that time period. I would not recommend.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|There is a need for constant tapping which means less time for enjoyment.  If you spend money to avoid tapping all the time,  there is a nasty design flaw of everything being too small for a younger child to coordinate.  I have tiny hands and still have problems tapping or moving items.  I got the app because I loved the movie.  I hope the developers remember who they are creating the app for and fix the app to make it more enjoyable for the little ones to use.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book was good and I can't wait for the last book but it was kind of slow pace and sort of confusing.  I know it was part of the mystery but did they really have to wait so long to reveal certain names.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django's revisioning of slavery in the south was actually inspiring. It's how I feel I would have wanted to be had I lived 200 years ago... it makes me respect john brown more.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I was afraid Season 2 was not going to be as good as Season 1, but then they introduced Hook!!! He's worth watching anything just to see him!!! The story line improved as well over the course of the season and developed into a great introduction for Season 3. Looking forward to seeing more of Captain Hook in Neverland!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I didn't see Season one or season two. It goes to show this is the first time I've actually watch the TV show that keeps me watching
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is much better than the older version. easier to use..much better radar and more attractive. very glad to have upgraded.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Another Tom Cruise Classic. They did a very good job making Tom Cruise a Bad-Ass. About the only thing that was mediocre was the \\"Heroic save someone in a Gravel-pit Scene\\".
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this battery app!!!  It is easy to use and when I plug my kindle in to charge, it goes straight to this app.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|Great movie! If you love or interesting in anything about the Civil War this is a must watch! Acting is fantastic and stays true to event and the book \\"Killer Angels\\" (I believe that is the book, could be wrong). Anyway watch this movie, just make sure you have 4 hours to spare :)
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book gets my rating of 5 stars purely on the in-depth information the author supplies. I am a voracious reader of anything self-help, and oftentimes I am left disappointed because of books that are heavy on filler and light on information. You won't get that in this book.<br /><br />Charles Duhigg completely spells out why we have the habits that we have, and how we can change them if we choose to. He not only gives a road map to changing habits, but gives real world examples of how changing your habits can affect your life.<br /><br />I have read it through once already. My plan is to read it through once more to pick up anything I might have missed the first time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun loved it its  . Amazinga bizinga would reccomend to buddy lol a ny ways.bye<br />From fielding race head  chicken nugget maneger
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I didn't really have any interest in watching this I borrowed it from the library for the kids; as the kids were watching it, I was totally drawn in and sat down on the couch. It was really cute and funny - I laughed out loud on a number of occasions, to the point that we decided to purchase it. We have watched it a couple of times and I still think it's cute!  It will be a great movie to watch around Halloween every year.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is so much better then the facebook app that my kindle originally started with. They should make this the one you get on the first place it is so good. Like I sayer already: LOVE IT &lt;3333333

B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is so good and u don't even need wifi!!!! love it! and u can get any youtube video that you want!
B008Q00BOQ|2.0|This is the movie that almost killed the franchise before it really got started.  John Woo is not an action movie director.  How many slow motion shots do you need to have in a movie.  He did the same thing with the Hulk and killed that franchise as it started too.<br /><br />The story is silly and the action is very staged.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|All of Tolkien's books (not only the rings trilogy), are my favorite escapist reading material.<br />Your having made it possible for me to purchase them at an affordable price and my being now able to begin a collection of them on film excites me to pieces!<br />Thank you so very much!<br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Michael Ward
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This Book and Movie was not your typical lovie dovie story.  It had alot of unexpected suspense.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Not just Nicholas Sparks fans.  I really enjoy his books into movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome. When I'm have to use the bathroom I wait and sit on the deep freezer.While I'm playing the game I listen to some music.subway surfer helps me relax.Unfortunately a week a go a friend accidentally restarted my kindle but I'm a get everything back.Thanks to my,friend janae chin I know now how fun this game really is
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I haven't read the books, but decided to watch the movie.  I enjoyed it for the most part.  It wasn't quite as good as I was expecting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is absolutely the best game I have ever played. I must also say it is very addictive. Once you start playing this game, it is hard to stop. I am a 58 year old female and I love it. My granddaughter is 5 years old and she loves playing it too. VERY GOOD GAME.....
B001GXF2YY|4.0|The story was good, however I would have liked a little more from the ending.  It left me a bit unfulfilled.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I Love kevin Costner. Also Morgan Freeman & Christian Slater. So many great actors in this movie. It's an old movie but I never get tired of it. I will enjoy it for many years to come.
0061122416|5.0|I have read this book times.  I love it.  I bought this book for a person who seems lost in this world.  I hope you decide to buy it, because I am sure you will like it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I  would have to say it makes more sense to read this series after reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians series; but on the other hand, this series is so action packed it's amazing! It Introduces New characters to the whole franchise with new talents and abilities to add to the story. This book specifically talks about a future for some of these demigods which until now, they didn't think was possible. It's great !
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock is AWESOME!! Thrilling, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat mysteries. I only wish they would have more episodes (the episodes are about 1.5-2 hours each, though).
B00C5ZORES|5.0|this is one of the best albums of the last five years ..... easily! soo freakin good! i cannot stop listening to it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I thought I was going to have to purchase a new Kindle when it would not charge. This and the PowerFast did the trick! good customer service, thanks!
B0054SMID0|5.0|McConaughey OWNS the character of Mickey Haller, which is a good and bad thing. Good, because this excellent book deserved this equally excellent movie and portrayal. Bad, because McConaughey's career has since reignited and it seems unlikely he will make a sequel. The #3 book in this series by Michael Connelly, The Reversal, is especially movie-worthy, just in case McConaughey wants to have some more fun, which he clearly did making this one!
B00867GK26|5.0|If you don't own this...it's a sad day on Earth! It's one of the best things human kind has ever created. It's a beautiful story with insane animation. This type of work at it's best.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Bought the camera kit to get pics from my camera to my IPad and it does that job quite well.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|This is a rare album! Enlightening, layered, modern, edgy, moody, distinctive and full of feeling. It's also non-pretentious and not trying to perpetrate as just another artsy album. Take Thom Yorke and put him in the year 2099, and you get James Blake.<br /><br />If you have a ghost, play this and they'll be the haunted instead of them haunting you! enjoy!
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Action, love, science fiction, morality stories, love stories, period scenes and great sets throughout.  Just sit back and watch.  You don't have to believe in reincarnation or anything like that to enjoy
B002UEW31I|1.0|This is truly one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen. No really. The worst of it is, is that it starts off comparatively well. But like a lazy, overgrown spoilt school kid, Tarantino gets bored and ruins everything until it all ends in an absolute mess. I suppose it appeals to the sort of person who nods sagely at the end of the film while still munching their popcorn and slowly says: \\"So THAT'S how Hitler died\\". Oh, the Hitchens thing? He said watching it was like \\"sitting in the dark having a great pot of warm **** emptied very slowly over your head.\\" Can't say I felt differently.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Comic book stuff, but very engaging with an emphasis on characters and their relationships.  Watch for English landmarks in their locations.

B00BLCHXWY|5.0|This first look was enough for me to invest in the series. I have followed IGN's ratings about the episodes, they tend to like them. So do a most of the people that watch the show! Can't wait to start!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I downloaded this game and it's ok. My son played it more than I did and he like it too.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|I liked alex. Recommend it for everyooooooneeee. And yeah. It's really good. Loved it. Pretty cool book. I enjoyed it.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This game is rated ok from me. I didn't play it much but I guess it's what someone likes. My son played it more than me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was recommended by a friend. It starts off easy and then becomes very challenging. It can be very addictive.
B007N85POS|3.0|This game was ok, I played it a few times, wasn't anything that kept my interest for long. My son liked it.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|5 stars because this is very funny and clever.  Both my 2.5 year old and I can sit down and enjoy it -- each getting different humor.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My daughter had previously watched all these movies, but wanted this & said it was a good price.  She is thrilled.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|What happened to the Walking Dead this season? What were the writers thinking? Were they trying to disappoint? Because if that is the case then they succeeded. The whole season was very slow and very disappointing. They made unlikeable characters into big deals and the story line around those terrible characters. I literally had to turn off my TV once because I disliked Merle and Andrea that much. And the best part is, was I supposed to cry at the end? There was too much drama and not enough action. I understand there is only so much you can do with zombies but when are they going to explain HOW THIS HAPPENED? I could care less that the governor had his zombie daughter on a leash and heads in his room....
B00BTYP6QE|3.0|Fun, but you HAVE TO BUY SUPERPOWERS to pass level 9.<br />FYI, at a certain point, you just can't do anything to pass this level without buying superpowers.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Over the top special effects.<br />His movies always have a very comic-book feel to them.<br />The cast is perfect. The battle scenes are exactly what your looking for if you've seen a Tarantino film before.<br />Who doesn't love a good - the evil slave owners get exactly what they deserve type film? :D<br />Glorifies violence.<br /><br />Caution: Strong graphic violence. One scene with brief female nudity. It makes sense for the movie, not just gratuitous nudity, but it's still there and probably could have been done without showing nudity.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the twists and turns that season 2 has brought to the series.<br />Excellent story, great actors and a wonderful production!
B00CJ1PXNW|4.0|I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this album since about 30 seconds into listening to their awesome self-titled debut. A second album can make or break a band, and fortunately, Kadavar does not fall victim to the dreaded Sophomore Slump. Like their first album, there's no filler here. While there's no doubt that these guys have heard Sabbath's first four albums more than once, their influences obviously run a lot deeper than mere Ozzy-worship. If anything, Kadavar is all about celebrating the glory days of the Power Trio.<br /><br />Abra Kadavar isn't a carbon copy of their debut, however. The most noticeable difference is the live-in-the-studio sound. On the upside, this gives a spontaneous feel to the album and only furthers my resolve to see these guys live if they ever make it to my neck of the woods; the downside is that the sound is slightly muddier than their first album. Still, as long as Lupus Lindemann is able to deliver that nasty wah-wah sound, I'm gonna be happy, and there's plenty of nasty guitar work to be found here.<br /><br />Too many metal bands approach songwriting as a matter of cutting-and-pasting riffs together in Pro Tools; Kadavar's music feels organic, as if the songs were honed from epic jam sessions. More of this, please!<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm on my second listen as I write this, and I know that it's going to be listened to at least once a day for the next couple of weeks. To me, that's the sign of a great album.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love Michael Buble and this CD is awesome. Anyone who likes Buble and his kind of music will love it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Fun and entertaining. Kind of takes up a ton of storage on kindle but whatever. Worth the money.<br />Blah blah blah
B0018RC7QE|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. What a waste of two brilliant actors. There really doesn't seem to be any reason for the two main characters to act as they do. There's no explanation, nothing that we can hold on to in order to somewhat justify their actions. This is a terribly boring movie with an utterly LAME story line.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|If you're reading reviews about Vampire Weekend's third album, Modern Vampires of the City, you are gonna hear the word \\"mature\\" over and over. The band has cultivated a reputation for being over-educated, slightly bratty punks. Whether it be the lyrics centered around posh lives or the ironic wardrobes of the band members, I think that Vampire Weekend has been disregarded in some circles as being aggressively twee. Modern Vampires of the City is set to change some minds though -- the album, and the lyrics in particular, is in my mind, the band's career highlight thus far. Modern Vampires of the City is thoughtful, catchy, fun, weird, and well-crafted. On this album, Vampire Weekend captures some of the magic that made Animal Collective's Merriwether Post Pavilion so good -- the songs here are strange, eclectic, and progressive, but for all of its unfamiliar parts, everything is centered with great pop-centric melodies.<br /><br />Vampire Weekend's bread-and-butter has been their ability to take modern indie rock and fuse it with traditionally-African sounds. While this is still largely true on the quartet's third album, it may be less true than it has been on previous albums. Instead, the music feels more eclectic here than it ever has been before. Every now and then, the guitars or vocals will twang with some of the African motifs, but for the most part, the band seems more interested in trying out new instruments or vocal modulations. The album begins with \\"Obvious Bicycle\\" and \\"Believers.\\" These first two songs are fine, the first is a midtempo, laid back song that doesn't really announce the album in any way; the second track is more upbeat with some folk/americana vibes carrying it through its run time. These tracks aren't particularly bad, but they're definite growers that aren't as immediately accessible as some of the latter tracks. However, beginning with the third track, \\"Step\\" the band finds its footing -- the song has a well worn feeling, both musically and lyrically, as frontman Ezra Koenig recalls the places that he has been, presumably on tour away from home. It's characterized by a soft melancholia that never overplays the emotion.<br /><br />\\"Diane Young\\" seems to be one of the early favorites on the record. The song is a fast, synthesizer-driven, R&B-infused pop song -- where I may have called attention to the lyrics on Modern Vampires of the City, this track certainly isn't a good showcase of that. Instead, the song is just 2 minutes and 40 seconds of good times and fun. \\"Hannah Hunt\\" recalls some of the same sounds that \\"Step\\" uses, but to arguably greater effect: it's one of the most warm and beautiful songs on the record with just the right amount of restraint. \\"Everlasting Arms\\" is driven by African-themed percussion; the bass and keys take a backseat to the drums and vocals here. The song has a strong melody, and it sounds the most familiar of the bands' work out of all of the tracks collected here. \\"Ya Hey\\" is one of the catchier songs on the album, and it makes use of some high vocal modulation that is sure to annoy some -- the band makes it work here in this context though. The lyrics deal with religious/existential doubt as seen from a young Jewish person -- who knew crippling religious doubt sound so fun? \\"Ya Hey\\" (or \\"Yaweh\\" -- get it?) is probably my favorite track on the entire record. The final track, \\"Young Lion\\" is less than two minutes long, and it leaves the record on a note that is just as fuzzy, grey, and distant as the album's cover art.<br /><br />I would recommend this album to anyone interested in modern alternative/indie rock. Vampire Weekend's third album shows a band that grown tremendously since 2010's Contra -- the music and lyrics are all sophisticated but not stuffy, different but not pretentious, and well crafted but not overly technical. I would recommend Modern Vampires of the City to fans of Yeasayer, Animal Collective, MGMT, or Passion Pit. If you are a fan of the band, hearing this album is non-optional. If you've listed to the band's previous two records and not been impressed, Modern Vampires of the City offers enough new sounds and ideas that the band may be worth trying out again. Myself, I wasn't head-over-heels for their self-titled debut or Contra, but I absolutely love this album. I really hate the name of it though (I've been trying not to comment on it this entire review).earing this album is non-optional.

0812983459|5.0|What a refreshing novel!  A man, Harold Fry, gets a letter from a coworker he hasn't seen or heard from in two decades.  Seems she is dying of cancer, and so Harold writes a quick &#34;thank you for your letter, I am very sorry&#34; reply.  As he leaves to post it at the end of his driveway, he just... keeps walking.  Later, he decides to hoof it the 600+ miles to the hospice where his old friend is staying.<br /><br />And in the long weeks of walking, Harold learns about people, himself, nature, his wife, his son, and more.<br /><br />&#34;Harold believed his journey was truly beginning.  He had thought it started the moment he decided to walk to Berwick, but he saw now that he had been naive.  Beginnings could happen more than once, or in different ways.  You could think you were starting something afresh, when actually what you were doing was carrying on as before.  He had faced his shortcomings and overcome them, and so the real business of walking was happening only now&#34; (p. 156).<br /><br />And author Rachel Joyce pens one of the softest passing scenes I think I have ever read:<br /><br />&#34;Queenie parted her lips, hunting for the next intake of air.  And when it didn't come, but something else did, it was as easy as breathing&#34; (p. 313).<br /><br />Wonderful.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  My Pastor had been bragging how good it was, and he did not lie.  Please purchase, because what is said, and portrayed is a good message.
125000098X|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has written a great series with the Clifton Chronicles. Be sure to start with the first one so you can keep the story line. This keeps you guessing and wondering with each chapter. Very enjoyable and one of Archers best! Highly recommend it.

B005LJITS0|5.0|I love this story about a man who is chosen for potential he didn't realize he had,. Then overcomes his fears to be great!!
0441020712|5.0|I enjoyed this novel very much. Whatever \\"universe\\" Reynolds imagines, it is always elaborate, well thought out, with the hard science married to vivid writing and images. (How imaginative were Chasm City and Century Rain? Breaths of fresh air.) The same is true here. (How about a region on Mars where cast-off machines are themselves evolving as they chew each other up.) The difference this time is, as has been mentioned by others, more time spent with character developement. The result is still recognizably Reynolds, though, even as his writing evolves. For me, this is a plus; for others, maybe not so much. Yes, the science fiction part matters, but so too does the writing. Many writers succeed more with the former than with the latter (and need better editors). Excellence at both is a potent combination. For me, Reynolds has the balance that should keep him in the forefront of Science Fiction writing for years to come. Sequels to this novel promise a compelling series.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|You will enjoy this read too if you like stories that switch back and forth between the past and present.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake is amazing and i already had a digital copy of all of the songs on the album but wanted to have a hard copy at home.  was excited to see the inserts and photos inside.... there's really no reason not to get this!
B0059F7I24|4.0|THANK YOU TRIVIUM!!!<br /><br />Because of The Crusade, I stopped listening to them. I never actually even bought Shogun. All I did was listen to a handful of songs on youtube. From what it sounded like to me, they still had those Metalica styled vocals (which I couldn't stand) that were in The Crusade.<br /><br />After the fist few minutes into the album, I knew that Trivium was on their way back to their original style. It was such a relief to finally hear them play like this again. I swear it almost brought a tear to my eye lol.<br /><br />Although this album won't top their first two, it comes pretty close to being just as good as them. I just hope that they keep going in this direction and I'll pretend that The Crusade never happened.
B005K8QIS0|4.0|Enjoyed this series.  The storylines are pretty wild, and all-too coincidental, but i think that's the point.  Jason Isaacs does a good job.  Looking forward to next season.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It took me a long time to even become interested in this book.  It is better now and the story is interesting and believable but I cannot say I have a character I have connected with.<br /><br />The &#34;teens&#34; of the story are more interesting than the adults -- that much I will say.

B00BK40QO0|4.0|Otto Klemperer's association with Mahler himself, and his recordings of about half of the major works, are familiar to many music lovers, and make no mistake, here in this superb-value boxed set, all lovingly remastered very recently, are performances which have stood the test of time, and remain at or near the top of any Mahler recommendations.<br /><br />Possibly the best thing here is The Resurrection, beautifully paced, beautifully sung, and as dramatic and overwhelming as any recording I know. It's now just over 80 minutes long, by the way, suggesting that the rumours of the earlier CD releases having been sped up slightly could well be true. The Fourth too has an elegance that is hard to beat, again beautifully sung in the finale by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, even if she is hardly boy-ish in her tone.<br /><br />The last two great finished works of Mahler, Das Lied and the 9th Symphony benefit here from Klemperer's stately approach. I miss the zing that someone like Solti gets into the inner movements of No.9, but there is something inherently \\"right\\" about the Klemperer way, and both are moving performances, even on the nth hearing. Das Lied is genuinely a performance of stature, with Christa Ludwig cool, but powerful in the bigger songs, and (an often overlooked consideration) Fritz Wunderlich living up to his name in the tenor songs, the best tenor recording I have of this piece. I do prefer Janet Baker to Ludwig, but I fancy a touch more warmth in Der Abschied, merely a personal preference, which no doubt many will disagree with. Ludwig is also excellent in the selection of songs included in this box, three of the Ruckert Lieder and a couple of Wunderhorn songs (incidentally the only items not newly remastered).<br /><br />I knew these recordings from before, but I am glad I have invested in this absurdly cheap box, as the recordings now sound fresher, clearer and almost ageless. And as a set it is worth having for these four big recordings, which are, as I said among the best ever made.<br /><br />And the worst? Klemperer's Mahler 7 is surely one of the most appalling renditions of any major work ever committed to disc. This is a version new to me, and I did buy the box almost exclusively so as to check this reading out. There is some beauty in the performance (well done all members of the New Philharmonia for persevering!) especially some lovely passages in the two Nachtmusiks, but to all intents and purposes this sounds like someone conducting a professional orchestra at school orchestra rehearsal pace. Somehow Klemperer takes just over a hundred minutes to get through the work, and it feels significantly longer! My favourite readings - Abbado and Solti - are not unusual in taking 20-plus minutes less. The first movement lumbers along, never gain momentum, and the closing pages (among the finest music Mahler ever wrote) have none of that inexorable cumulative effect others do. Twenty Eight minutes!!!! Good grief!<br /><br />It doesn't get much better. The \\"Castrol GTX\\" music of the second movement is hardly recognisable as the beautiful serenade it is, and the formally weak second nachtmusik drags and drags and drags, even though some have played it even slower than Otto! And while the best performance really let rip in the finale and go for it hell-for-leather, here it is all distinctly underwhelming. The booklet notes here describe the performance as \\"eccentrically laboured\\". An understatement, I'd say.<br /><br />If you are intrigued by this infamous Seventh, don't be, it's dull, and will inspire intense dislike for what is a beautiful, fantastic, magical work. But if you want to hear a conductor at his very best, Nos. 2, 4, 9 and Das Lied are out of this world.id among the best ever made.<br /><br />And the worst?

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|As always Nicholas Sparks delivers.  The book was a great read and the movie followed it as well as Hollywood would allow..
B00008GKEG|5.0|I have a 4 1/2 year old Beatle Fan.  My son Aidan fell in love with the Beatles when he was 3 after I showed him Yellow Submarine.  He now has all UK releases on CD and most US releases on Vinyl or Cassette.  When I showed him the Anthology DVD's he loved it.  This has his favorite songs and explains the history of the band.  I'm sure he'll watch this over and over for years to come...
B000002UTY|5.0|Who Do You Love, by Bo Diddley stretched over the fist side of this album was the epitome of excellent jamming not played by The Grateful Dead. The different members of the band had segments featuring their solo's, but in the fashion of every great jam it returned to the original beat and playing from the beginning.<br />Also on this awesome collection of songs recorded at both the Fillmore East and Fillmore West, were the songs Mona, Maiden Of The Cancer Moon, and the theme song Happy Trails.<br />Included is one of their best and most under-rated songs, Calvary, recorded live at Golden State Recorders in San Francisco.<br />If you love the Grateful Dead from the Live/Dead era, get this album! They shared the stage on many nights, so the vibe is evident. I bought the CD because my original LP has been played so many times that it is too scratchy to enjoy. The CD is perfect! Play it loud & play it often....with the windows down!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Definitely recommend this book. It surprised me because I am not typically a fan of the vampire and other fantasy books but this book was more relatable. Truly enjoyable. Can't wait to read the next one. Downloading now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is perfect to bridge that gap between console and mobile gaming. I'm an avid console gamer, but this blew my mind. It is the first mobile game that I could play endlessly without getting bored and moving to something else. It is a top quality experience which utilizes the mobile touch screen perfectly. I hope more developers can take note from the Room. I couldn't put it down so I finished it pretty quickly, but it has left me wanting more. Looking forward to more content and games from Fireproof.

B0025KVLRY|5.0|This review goes hand in hand with my review of [[[ASIN:B0025KVLRO Please Please Me]]] and uses the same title and a lot of the same information.<br /><br />50 years ago, last March, PLEASE PLEASE ME (PPM) was originally released to astounding public and critical acclaim. Unfortunately, the USA would not see our first Beatles album for almost a year, and of course it has been drilled extensively, until there are no more places to find for drilling, in the endless reviews on Amazon, for each and every Beatle album available today. I doubt many will read this review, so I am taking a new tack in my headline, and in these Beatles reviews. The history is so intensively covered and anyone with the slightest curiosity or failing memories, can pretty much look up their answers about The Beatles in about 10,000 places on the world wide web. I keep getting nudged by readers to write Beatles album reviews in concert with my pen name, something I have avoided because of the monstrous amount of reviews already posted, and because essentially, what more is there to say? Okay so there are billions of fans, old and new, and with any keen interest, as I indicated, you find your answers almost anywhere. So in celebration of the 50th anniversary, let's forget that a little less than 49 years from now, on my 8th birthday, I watched The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show and fell in love with what my father called that insane yeah-yeah-yeah music. Let's forget the personal histories and the critical histories, and the Beatles analyses and histories, and let's talk about the music! I want to introduce the young people who have heard OF the music, who might even KNOW the music but who are replacing the lexicon of the \\"classic rock\\" idiom with \\"classical\\" idiom. When I was kid, The Three B's were Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms. By the time I was in college, pop culture had replaced The Three B's with Bach, Beethoven, and Beatles (a much more likely candidate anyway since Brahms was sleepy lullaby music, LOL). Okay, so now The Fab Four have cemented their place in history and I am sure that in some not too distant future, rock and roll as we knew it, will have established itself as a cultural art form in the genre of classics. The Beatles then will be the masters of that, no doubt, and I dare say there will not be one dissenting vote on that anywhere on the planet.<br /><br />The Beatles UK and USA catalogues were so vastly different up to Sgt Pepper's release, that I did not own this particular version of WITH THE BEATLES (WTB) until it was released as an import from Parlophone in my college days. My mom was indulgent enough to buy me Beatles albums for birthdays and Christmas as a youngster so I had a nice Capitol Records collection, most of which was worn to shreds by the 70's. The Parlophone import was a stereo version and pretty much rivals the new remastered discs (2009), more on that in a moment. According to Mark Lewisohn, link PPM, WTB was recorded on a two-track BTR tape recording machine, with most of the instrumentation on one track and the vocals on the other, allowing for a better balance between the two on the final quarter-inch tape mix-down in mono. My 70's \\"stereo\\" release was more like \\"High Fidelity\\" which was a fancy way of saying Mono with characteristics of enveloping sound, but not true stereo! In '88, after the release of the original UK Beatles catalogue on CD, my wife bought me the whole collection in a nice collectors \\"Breadbox\\" with a roll-top. All of the first four albums on CD were of the same HiFi mono but I have to say the sound is spectacular and better than many stereo \\"remasters\\" of classic rock. If you own one of the 1987-88 CD's, you might want to think twice about the 2009 remasters. For purists, Beatlemaniacs like myself, the '88 CD catalogue is indispensable and mathematically perfect in an auditory engineering perspective. However, the curious (myself included), the un-initiated youth of now, might more enjoy the 2009 remasters. Just bear in mind that previous explanation of the two-track BTR tape recording machine, with most of the instrumentation on one track and the vocals on the other, that the stereo mix was made at the same time as the mono mix, with one track on the left channel and the other on the right, as well as an added layer of reverb to better blend the two tracks together. This was common practice for playback on stereo consoles in 1963 when this album was engineered. Listening to it in \\"stereo\\" this way is singularly unique but many of us have found it rather disconcerting. I have purchased PPM, WTB, HARD DAY'S NIGHT, and BEATLES FOR SALE (the four original Mono engineered remastered in Stereo in 2009) in this manner, and that was by mp3 because from all I had read, I was not sure I was going to like it (and still remain on the fence) and my CD's are still perfect to my ears. No Reply on BEATLES FOR SALE seems to have gained the most from this new Stereotomy, at least by my liking, but the music is definitely enjoyable and no one should shy away from the new releases on my say so, not by any means. However, if you are \\"new\\" to the Beatles, are a purist musicologist by any measure, and want historical accuracy in your explorations, I do urge you to seek out and find nice fresh copies of the '88 releases.<br /><br />Now, about the songs! This review is for the young and novice Beatles explorers. Again, will not waste time with repetition of a thousand and one historical docu-dramas on The Beatles and the history leading up to this album, that can be found ad infinitum on these pages, so let's talk about the songs. It might fascinate one to find out that PPM was produced in what has been called a \\"marathon recording\\", at 10:00 am on Monday, 11 February 1963, the Beatles and George Martin started recording studio tracks of what was essentially their live act in 1963, and they finished 585 minutes later (9 hours and 45 minutes). There were very few overdubs and edits used in these sessions so what you hear is almost what went down note for note in the studio. WTB was accomplished in much the same way, only in small chunks in between one of the most hectic schedules in music history. Recorded between July and October, WTB made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor but some vocal overdubs are really as much \\"editing\\" as was accomplished for this second astonishing feat of music. Lennon said of their songs during this period, that he and McCartney were just cranking out \\"pop songs with no more thought of them than that--to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant.\\" Hence, you have simple early 60's rock and roll in its purest form. What The Beatles brought to this continent, in their electric guitar rock, was a fresh and dynamic image of the already innate American sound of Bill Haley & The Comets, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Chuck Berry.  WTB was simply an extension of PPM since the song-writing duo Lennon-McCartney already had a full catalogue when they went into the studio in February, so come November release time for WTB, their songs and covers were still spilling over in the recording sessions.<br /><br />Eight of the 14 tracks on the album are original compositions (including a first from George) and six are covers, again brilliant covers, which many agree are summarily better than the original recordings! You might be interested, if music history is your bag, to know something about these songs.  Let's start with the covers.<br /><br />Till There Was You is quite simply a song everyone knows (or should know), a blissful and yet subtly wistful tune from The Music Man (sung by Shirley Jones in the movie version).  In the hands of Paul McCartney it takes on a different kind of charm, a Broadway ode turned pop record, complete with some Liverpudlian accent markers.  Paul supposedly was only familiar with the Peggy Lee cover which might account for the slight jazz inflection given it by The Beatles.  The result is a unique sounding song in the repertoire of The Beatles.<br /><br />Please Mr. Postman.  As with many of the covers on PPM, the fact that The Beatles loved American girl-groups is inescapable now.  They ALMOST completed their second act without one, but the inclusion of Please Mr. Postman on WTB is actually a blessing.  Motown's goddess act, The Marvelettes, hit it big with their initial release in '61, under Berry Gordy's flagship label, the song almost defined R&B Rock.  John Lennon reversed the gender and implored the lyrics much more desperately and convincingly (IMHO) than Gladys Horton (Marvelettes lead singer), with answering harmonies from George and Paul, beautifully done, if only a bit vacuous from too much high-hat (blame Sir George Martin, not Ringo).  If you are a fan, this is the version copied by The Carpenters and not the original.<br /><br />Roll Over Beethoven.  This song is the meat and potatoes of this album.  George Harrison was a HUGE Chuck Berry fan and this was a staple with The Beatles before they had even named themselves.  John and Paul were covering the song before George joined up, and his Chuck-ing guitar solos added the dimension they had lacked.  This is the song, whereby the kingdom of Rock and Roll was officially handed over from Berry to Beatles.  For the curious:  Roll Over Beethoven is a composite tunesmithing where Berry has used numerous musical allusions and tips of the hat.  Beethoven and Tchaikovsky because his little sister would hog the piano playing classical music when he wanted to play contemporary pop.  \\"Early In The Mornin'\\" is referenced, a Louis Jordan tune, and of course Carl Perkins is nodded to with \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\".  Ingeniously, Chuck gave his label mate and friend Bo Diddley a subtle wink with using nursery rhyme (The Cat And The Fiddle), \\"Hey Diddle Diddle\\".  Interestingly enough, Roll Over Beethoven is supposed to be a \\"rock and roll\\" song and yet Berry identifies his bag as \\"a shot of rhythm and blues\\".<br /><br />You Really Got A Hold On Me.  The Beatles hit up Motown again, this time the master painter being ripped off is the man with the velvet voice himself, Smokey Robinson.  Now I just happen to think Smokey's voice was the soul of Motown and this song his first real classic (the song itself has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame!).  So saying that, John Lennon on lead and George on very close harmony, with a little grit thrown in, The Beatles cover sounds like a better recording technologically but not vocally, not for me.  As a Beatle fan however, I love the song and it sits very smartly on this album.  Just don't try to compare it to the original.<br /><br />Devil In Her Heart.  This song was by a little known girl group in 1962 called The Donays.  The group failed to chart and then simply failed.  The inclusion of this on WTB, a masterpiece by any other standard, makes it the weakest song on the album.  It has some redeemable features, but if you measure the whole by the sum of the parts, Devel In Her Heart is the weak link in the structure of an otherwise near perfect mother of invention.<br /><br />Money.  Thankfully The Beatles ended their album on the strongest song, an often overlooked gemstone.  Yet it may be a Diamond-In-The-Rough, but intentionally so!  Money (That's What I Want) is a classic tune.  Berry Gordy himself wrote this for Barrett Strong and it became Motown's first ever hit single.  On With The Beatles, John just murders the song, it puts a definitive cap on the album in the same way Twist and Shout did for PPM a few months before.  The secret of The Beatles is starting strong and ending stronger.  In the 80's, the humorous punk group The Flying Lizards gave this song another twist to send it even further in the stratosphere, and who cannot like the song in all three incarnations?  I play them all back to back on my mp3 player!  But let's make it clear.  The obvious winner in the Money performance is The Beatles by a mile.  It's Tough!  It's In Your Face!  And it's full of Rock and Soul.<br /><br />All eight of the Lennon/McCatney and Harrison (now) compositions on the album are highly note-worthy of The Beatles catalogue in that they were the initial top creative juices of The Beatles first recording sessions of PPM and WTB.  It Won't Be Long kicks off the album in high octane performance as I Saw Her Standing There did on PPM.  It's a Lennon rocker with McCartney bridge sensibilities.  The chromatically descending chords of the middle eight are heaven.  All I've Got To Do is another Lennon gem, this time delivered in a rocking blues motif and draws on Smokey Robinson's essence for completeness.  As he did on PPM, Lennon invokes musical and lyrical homage to The Miracles and draws on You Can Depend On Me with a slight feeling of the Shirelles Baby It's You covered on PPM.  Then there is the prized McCartney hit single All My Loving, which for my money, far and away outshines all of the singles released to that date.  Following the same \\"letter model\\" used earlier on PS I Love You, Paul has George add in a Nashville country guitar solo and John uses a rhythm guitar of strummed triplets.  The result is another of the reasons The Beatles stormed our beaches so easily and invasion was literally invited.<br /><br />Don't Bother Me was Harrison's first song to appear on a Beatles record.  A landmark decision on the part of Lennon and McCartney since it gave him the confidence for future gemstones which would begin to appear on HELP!  It is a moody song with a sullen and somber style, highly unusual in Beatles at the time but because of that it left a lasting impression.  Double-tracked vocals and reverb guitar add to the essence of the song with Latin tinged percussion.  It is another \\"first\\" in the Beatles compendium.<br /><br />Little Child continues Lennon's rock fun.  Mainly written by Paul and described by him as \\"album filler\\", it may not be a great work of art, but it is sure casual fun.  On the other hand Hold Me Tight utterly fails at the same thing and is the second weakest track on the album.  Both Paul and John have publicly expressed a lot of disdain for this song.  The recording is discordant and Paul acknowledges singing \\"out of tune\\".  You can't win them all, and together with Devil In Her Heart, these two pretty much give the album it's clunkers.  Lennon's Not A Second Time again finds John trying to write Smokey.  Sir George Martin played the piano on this song and the double-tracked John vocals raise this one up to be a very interesting and enjoyable listen, and a perfect song to throw down before the tantalizing climax of Money.<br /><br />Last discussion:  I Wanna Be Your Man, penned by John and Paul and sung by Ringo.  If you are a Stones fan you probably know this one from ROLLED GOLD, it was the B Side for Not Fade Away.  Apparently John and Paul wrote the song during a Rolling Stones recording session.  The Stones needed one more song, so the story goes, and John and Paul happily obliged.  The Stones version was released a few weeks before the WTB album did!  The Beatles version, featuring Ringo on Jagger, is a tremolo open E guitar driven by a Vox AC30 amp.  Standard fare for rock of that age, now it is a bit dated, however enjoyable regardless.<br /><br />On the grand scale of music in general I give this album (and all other Beatles albums) 5 stars, but if comparing WITH THE BEATLES to the rest of the Beatles catalogue alone, I would give it 4 stars (and no Beatles album gets any lower than 4 stars from me). It is a wonderful relic of the past, and I do listen to it, and all my Beatles albums, on CD regularly. All the Beatles music is in regular rotation on my mp3 player. My favorites all start in '65 with HELP! and RUBBER SOUL, everything from there on getting 5 Stars comparatively to the rest of the body of work. Of the first 4 Beatles albums, the original two-track recorded albums, if I was to give advice to a novice, I would point them in the direction of HARD DAYS NIGHT, the album with the most creative output on it from the early era and definitely the best overall sounding of the first four. BEATLES FOR SALE spills over some of that but only approximately half (they were starting to figure out the engineering process and were recording their first overdubs to 4-track on these two albums), because the rest of 4 Sale harkens back to the first two album stylistically and technologically (due to the fact that they were rushed to get it out and had to add filler from older cast-asides). All in all though, remembering that I am a Beatlemaniac of the first order, it is difficult to rate anything they have done poorly or even with mediocrity. Therefore, as a classic recording would go, this is an item that belongs in everyone's collection if they like modern music and appreciate rock and roll. The 2009 stereo release or the 1988 original mono? Well partner, that is up to you! There are things I like about both masters, and things I dislike about them, usually by virtue of missing one when listening to the other, get it?<br /><br />Okay, now you go get it!bag as \\"a shot of rhythm and blues\\".<br /><br />You Really Got A Hold On Me.  The Beatles hit up Motown again, this time the master painter being ripped off is the man with the velvet voice himself, Smokey Robinson.  Now I just happen to think Smokey's voice was the soul of Motown and this song his first real classic (the song itself has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame!).

This song was by a little known girl group in 1962 called The Donays.  The group failed to chart and then simply failed.  The inclusion of this on WTB, a masterpiece by any other standard, makes it the weakest song on the album.  It has some redeemable features, but if you measure the whole by the sum of the parts, Devel In Her Heart is the weak link in the structure of an otherwise near perfect mother of invention.<br /><br />Money.  Thankfully The Beatles ended their album on the strongest song, an often overlooked gemstone.  Yet it may be a Diamond-In-The-Rough, but intentionally so!  Money (That's What I Want) is a classic tune.  Berry Gordy himself wrote this for Barrett Strong and it became Motown's first ever hit single.  On With The Beatles, John just murders the song, it puts a definitive cap on the album in the same way Twist and Shout did for PPM a few months before.  The secret of The Beatles is starting strong and ending stronger.  In the 80's, the humorous punk group The Flying Lizards gave this song another twist to send it even further in the stratosphere, and who cannot like the song in all three incarnations?  I play them all back to back on my mp3 player!  But let's make it clear.  The obvious winner in the Money performance is The Beatles by a mile.  It's Tough!  It's In Your Face!  And it's full of Rock and Soul.<br /><br />All eight of the Lennon/McCatney and Harrison (now) compositions on the album are highly note-worthy of The Beatles catalogue in that they were the initial top creative juices of The Beatles first recording sessions of PPM and WTB.  It Won't Be Long kicks off the album in high octane performance as I Saw Her Standing There did on PPM.  It's a Lennon rocker with McCartney bridge sensibilities.  The chromatically descending chords of the middle eight are heaven.  All I've Got To Do is another Lennon gem, this time delivered in a rocking blues motif and draws on Smokey Robinson's essence for completeness.  As he did on PPM, Lennon invokes musical and lyrical homage to The Miracles and draws on You Can Depend On Me with a slight feeling of the Shirelles Baby It's You covered on PPM.  Then there is the prized McCartney hit single All My Loving, which for my money, far and away outshines all of the singles released to that date.  Following the same \\"letter model\\" used earlier on PS I Love You, Paul has George add in a Nashville country guitar solo and John uses a rhythm guitar of strummed triplets.  The result is another of the reasons The Beatles stormed our beaches so easily and invasion was literally invited.<br /><br />Don't Bother Me was Harrison's first song to appear on a Beatles record.  A landmark decision on the part of Lennon and McCartney since it gave him the confidence for future gemstones which would begin to appear on HELP!  It is a moody song with a sullen and somber style, highly unusual in Beatles at the time but because of that it left a lasting impression.  Double-tracked vocals and reverb guitar add to the essence of the song with Latin tinged percussion.  It is another \\"first\\" in the Beatles compendium.<br /><br />Little Child continues Lennon's rock fun.  Mainly written by Paul and described by him as \\"album filler\\", it may not be a great work of art, but it is sure casual fun.  On the other hand Hold Me Tight utterly fails at the same thing and is the second weakest track on the album.  Both Paul and John have publicly expressed a lot of disdain for this song.  The recording is discordant and Paul acknowledges singing \\"out of tune\\".  You can't win them all, and together with Devil In Her Heart, these two pretty much give the album it's clunkers.  Lennon's Not A Second Time again finds John trying to write Smokey.  Sir George Martin played the piano on this song and the double-tracked John vocals raise this one up to be a very interesting and enjoyable listen, and a perfect song to throw down before the tantalizing climax of Money.<br /><br />Last discussion:  I Wanna Be Your Man, penned by John and Paul and sung by Ringo.  If you are a Stones fan you probably know this one from ROLLED GOLD, it was the B Side for Not Fade Away.  Apparently John and Paul wrote the song during a Rolling Stones recording session.  The Stones needed one more song, so the story goes, and John and Paul happily obliged.  The Stones version was released a few weeks before the WTB album did!  The Beatles version, featuring Ringo on Jagger, is a tremolo open E guitar driven by a Vox AC30 amp.  Standard fare for rock of that age, now it is a bit dated, however enjoyable regardless.<br /><br />On the grand scale of music in general I give this album (and all other Beatles albums) 5 stars, but if comparing WITH THE BEATLES to the rest of the Beatles catalogue alone, I would give it 4 stars (and no Beatles album gets any lower than 4 stars from me). It is a wonderful relic of the past, and I do listen to it, and all my Beatles albums, on CD regularly. All the Beatles music is in regular rotation on my mp3 player. My favorites all start in '65 with HELP! and RUBBER SOUL, everything from there on getting 5 Stars comparatively to the rest of the body of work. Of the first 4 Beatles albums, the original two-track recorded albums, if I was to give advice to a novice, I would point them in the direction of HARD DAYS NIGHT, the album with the most creative output on it from the early era and definitely the best overall sounding of the first four. BEATLES FOR SALE spills over some of that but only approximately half (they were starting to figure out the engineering process and were recording their first overdubs to 4-track on these two albums), because the rest of 4 Sale harkens back to the first two album stylistically and technologically (due to the fact that they were rushed to get it out and had to add filler from older cast-asides). All in all though, remembering that I am a Beatlemaniac of the first order, it is difficult to rate anything they have done poorly or even with mediocrity. Therefore, as a classic recording would go, this is an item that belongs in everyone's collection if they like modern music and appreciate rock and roll. The 2009 stereo release or the 1988 original mono? Well partner, that is up to you! There are things I like about both masters, and things I dislike about them, usually by virtue of missing one when listening to the other, get it?<br /><br />Okay, now you go get it!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is so nice to be able to keep in touch with my friends. Don't know why it took so long to purchase this.
1558908846|5.0|One of my favorite movies played by Sylvester Stallone. I'm not a huge fan of him but this movie is great.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|The best search engine I have found.  It is great and easy to use. I would certainly recommend it to everyone.
B000089RVX|5.0|Its hard to review something so good without using too many of the standard works , you know the type of thing. If you like the vids on UTube this album will not disappoint
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Very engaging. Keeps you on the edge of your seat to find out what is going to happen next to the heroine.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I absolutely loved every minute that I read this book, and as I was nearing the end, I was sorry to see it end--I wanted it to go on and on.  David Baldacci is a fine writer, and he really outdid himself in this one.  Putting a youngster in his story softens the usual intrigue of the life of an assasin.  My daughter read it with me, and she loved it as much as I did, and I ran out and bought it in hardback for my friend's birthday!  Every book Baldacci writes gets better than the last.<br />I am recommending it to all my friends as a &#34;Must read&#34;.<br />Alice Shay
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was a cross between heart-wrenching injustices and Irish countryside humor.  And Ms. McKenna made it work.  It is an unusual story that I won't soon forget.
B00C27LB20|5.0|This young man has created something special. This album, from start to finish, shows several genuine musical qualities that are usually not seen in someone so young. Catchy hooks and melodies, deep yet playful lyrics, great delivery, and all topped off with unflinching emotion that shows no sign of trepidation. This kid is a natural, and the fact that he has gotten my attention in such a big way is saying a lot. I'm usually somewhat critical of new music, considering how we're always being subjected to sugar coated, mass produced garbage as of late.<br /><br />This album is light years above and beyond all of it, and if you are tired of the no-talent nonsense that record companies insist on shoveling onto the public, this album is your salvation.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This is the first YouTube app for android that I have found that works. It is also easy to use.
B0033AGJ5Y|2.0|DVD did not work and tried it in different DVD players. this is my favorite movie that's why i ordered. I am sending it back and get my refund.
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|i love playing sim like games. this is an ok game. you dont get to play very long there isnt really much to do. but im going to give it some time to see if it gets better as i build it up more. i also wished you could interact with the people
B00985E3UG|5.0|Amazing book, so much information everyone should know.  You will learn so much about reading labels in this book.  You may think you already know it all.  There are some real eye openers in this book.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|i dont see myself playing this very much. kinda redondit. somewhat a challenge but very repeative.i wished it did more than the same pattern over and over
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you love period pieces, this is for you!  Ranks right up there with Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibilities!!
B007LB2B3K|5.0|This is a solid album.  High quality music and lyrics.  Additionally, Volbeat's music is great for driving, yet doesn't awaken the lead-footed monster.
B003PIUALI|3.0|The Last Starfighter is a campy 80's movie that is entertaining and generally holds up well through the years.  It is a fun movie that is light on sci-fi and had more laughs than one may think.  Today's kids may be bored with the film but back in the day this was one every guy in my 5th grade class saw multiple times.  Take a trip down memory lane or introduce the film to the next generation and you will be entertained - just don't expect too much going in.
B007LB2B3K|4.0|I'm new to Volbeat, but really like this album. I'm not a fan of the really heavy metal, so I don't care for the song Evelyn, but the rest of the album is great. I highly recommend this album for anybody that likes good music!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. The end was amazing! I never would have guessed that ending, I stayed jaw dropped and crying.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|I loved the book &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;, but this one fell short of expectations.  Seemed to be weak on subject material and forced to make clues work.  Kinda boring.
0525478817|5.0|This book was an incredible read; simply amazing.  Heartbreaking yet comedic - this book is a must read.  I finished it in just over two sittings, wishing I had hundreds more pages of Hazel, Gus, and Isaac.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing how the movie plays out.<br /><br />Read this book, and pass it along!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Tough subject that pulls at your tears, but well done from another angle.  Kept my attention all the way.  I really enjoyed the book.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|ordered this when i got my new kindle. love the way the kindle fits. i have mine wit hthe camera at the bottom,so it charges from the top. great case. what i am having trouble with is- when i stand it up. the plastic is sliding down the flat part.sometimes its tricky to get the right angle for it to stay up.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|Great disc from start to finish.  Not quite as guitar heavy as past albums, but still great.  Got to see these guys twice last year, still awesome as they've always beeen.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|Wasn't too thrilled with the last album but Overexposed reminded me of why I listened to them to begin with.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|While Iver's songs can blur together at first, repeated listening has opened up each song for me. That's always the mark of a good album, in my mind.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|One of the best sifi films ever made.  In spite of being over 50 years old, it can hold its own against most modern sifi movies.  In fact elements of this movie have been the genesis of ideas used in sifi movies and tv shows i.e light speed, high powered laser weapons, plantary exploration, robots, peronsal communication devices, scientific genius, security officer, terrifying monsters, and vanished advance civilizations that eveloved into extinction.  In fact tmany of hese elements reminds me of Star Trek.  You won't be diappointed.
B000GWE44U|5.0|the shining did for the horror genre what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for the science fiction genre, it elevated and imbued a genre perceived as trashy with depth and subtexts.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Tom Hanks movies.  We all remember wishing we could bypass being a kid and go straight to grown-up. The movie helps remind us it was good to be a kid while it lasted.
B004LQI0HE|5.0|Amazing movie! I couldn't stop being emotional when finishing. It makes you appreciate life more than ever. I love this movie
0385491026|5.0|book is in great shape and we received it quickly.  When ever there is an odd book to find, i can always get it here.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved this book, unique way of following a story by multiple different perspectives. Highly recommend checking this out if you havent done so yet.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|it is a stolen version,,,some songs are missing, and it stops for no reason and shows you a little camera sign lower on the screen.I was embarrassed to show this at my little girls party. I must be pirated...it's the only thin g that make sense.  I was fooled, but you don't need to be.
0060090367|5.0|Hats off to Marion Keyes, she is one of the very best chic lit authors and I always enjoy her books. She has a perfect combination of funny lines, hilarious plot entanglements and loveable, bonkers characters. Slowly working my way through all her books. Wonderful.
B007MG360G|1.0|Iloved the demo and was excited to find all of the different combos in the full version. Unfortunately I cannot even begin to find combos, the crashes after about 5 seconds.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|A lovely film about a robot in love. You don't even notice there's virtually no dialogue for the first hour!
B004T4LUPW|4.0|When I got my kindle, the first thing I wanted was a calendar app for my Google calendar that would look exactly the same on both my iPhone and the Kindle. This is perfect for exactly that. The only thing that I found annoying is having to pay for this app twice, once through iTunes, and again through Amazon. However, I am slightly less annoyed now that I've learned how indispensable it is for keeping track of EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Would be 5 stars if I hadn't had to pay for it twice :)
B0030IIZ56|5.0|One of the rare sequels in Hollywood that's as good as the original from a storytelling and character standpoint. Another wonderful installment in PIXAR's signature series.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|I want to love it, but it is a bit awkward. There is nowhere to attach the Marware stylus that I purchased to go along with it without feeling like I will break the clip or just straight lose it. It does a good job of being \\"just a case\\" but the price I paid makes me just feel lukewarm about it.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This is PIXAR at its very best! Breathtaking underwater visuals, fully developed characters, a warm father-son relationship, incredible action sequences (the jellyfish scene is amazing!), and so much humor. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory. Buy it!
B0000047CX|5.0|The seminal album...possibly of all time. It should be available free on prescription. If you don't have this already; buy it now.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|If you don't cry after the first 10 minutes, you don't have a heart. That sequence alone could be a short film. But it only gets better after that, and the rest of the movie is a delightful buddy comedy / quest story with a real heart. Love it.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|i think this is a great CD for Joe. its back to a more rock flavor. i am a big fan of the early stuff when he started using a full band in the studio and this CD brings it all back home with a modern touch. i did not have to skip any tracks on this one and by the third time of this CD in rotation i am really happy with it. dont judge the songs by the first 3 seconds most of them kick in later on . all in all i love this CD
B004I654WQ|4.0|\\"I think boys will generally enjoy this movie more than girls (my nephew certainly likes it better than my niece) but there's something here for everyone, even the parents.<br /><br />This may not be PIXAR's finest, but it's still a good movie with loads of funny moments. A bit long and nostalgic, much of which goes over the heads of kids, but that's okay. The race scenes in general are worth putting up with the rest.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this story of an Asperger's geneticist whos devises a questionaire to find a wife. This book is laugh out loud fun. Very cleverly written with an engaging story and humour galore.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|It's almost unheard of for the third film in a series to be as good as the original, but that's what we have here. PIXAR has made a winner by aging the human characters along with its original audience. What happens when we outgrow our favorite childhood toys? The answer might bring a tear to your eye.
B005HED08I|4.0|I enjoy the original Star Trek crew; they worked well together.  The 60's was a time of wholesome tv viewing without the sexuality and violence the permeates the current broadcast and movie industry.  Star Trek was the &#34;cutting edge&#34; science fiction of the day.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|The original and still the best! The visuals are still spectacular, even if the humans appear a bit rubbery at times. But who cares? This isn't about the humans, it's about the toys! And Woody and Buzz are great here.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Jamie Foxx in he's best moment, a real good time watching this awesome movie.<br />Quality movie soundtrack.<br />A MUST have.<br />enjoy
B008YWY0HK|5.0|As Pixar's first fairy tale and its first \\"princess\\" movie, I was very curious to see what they'd come up with. Would Brave's Merida be a traditional princess in the Disney mold, or a more modern girl?<br /><br />Well, it's the latter, thankfully. Merida is a great character and role model for girls (and boys, really) who are struggling between respecting their parents and growing into their own person.<br /><br />This isn't at all a story about a girl who a) needs rescuing, or b) falls helplessly in love. If anything, it's a love story about the complicated relationship between mothers and daughters. It's also about duty versus personal freedom.<br /><br />Merida is the kind of girl who doesn't wait around to be rescued. When the situation warrants, she rescues herself. Good for Pixar. A great movie!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It didn't have any fluff, nor did it have a fairytale ending. My only complaint was one of the characters, Somer. I wanted to slap her. She was an irritating, whinny, immature little brat. They were her choices, she needs to live with them. If she wasn't aware of the consequences, then you can add ignorant to the list.
B00B2OSZIW|4.0|This grip is great.. Love everything about it but it's alot of work to get to the batteries and card... I recommend this grip to anyone with a X-E1 you will love how it feels...
0739442309|5.0|I was so glad to find this in large print for an elderly loved one! Great book, and the font is big enough for easy reading.
B00007K02F|5.0|Franco Zeffirelli  brings an Italian flair to a British tale, with  French and American actors playing the leads, supported by a mainly British cast (along with Aussies).  It works well in a most charming and emotionally satisfying film.  Zeffirelli subdues his Italian over-the-top expression of emotion; except perhaps for the music which<br />  brims with feeling and almost tells the story by itself (Capponi and Vlad).  The costumes, cinematography, and story line are subdued but effective.  It's a gothic tale, so the \\"shadows are as important as the light\\".  Rochester is worldly wise and tough as an \\"india rubber ball.\\"  He sees  Jane as having a \\"strange unearthly beauty\\" .  He quizzes her about her talent (strange paintings) and asks her if that head on her shoulders has\\" more of the same kind of furniture within?\\"  Jane must subdue her emotions because she is \\"his hired servant\\".<br />  Well, you get the idea as the film shows Jane's austere character.  I cannot criticize Zeffirelli for bringing the later parts of the novel to a compact finale. It strays cinematically to bring the film to a  compressed but satisfying conclusion.  And so, readers, \\"I married him\\" she announces,  but is it to the  flawed and<br />broken Edward Rochester or the handsome god-like St. John Rivers?  Zeffirelli frames his last shot on the pastoral scene.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Brand new packaging and great box, got it along side the original trilogy as a gift. Recommend to any star wars fan, fan of the old or the new.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This was a great app. I would like to say I was surprised of how good this game was. The graphics are good and very few to no glitches. For a free game I was extremely impressed, I highly recommend this app.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|An amazing gamg love the stages you can have day night easy normal hard but please make turning smother and next chapters free for those who bought the game this game is well worth the money
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is fun I really like it and my nephews an nieces really like it too. It passes time like if your at the doctors office or just waiting for something it also relieves stress somehow
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|When I bought this book, it was my first on my Kindle Fire. Since buying it, I realized how funny the series is. I'd highly recommend this book for kids who want a good laugh.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Mr. Burke's. In my opinion, Tommy Lee Jones did a surpurb job of becoming Dave  Robeceux (?). I could smell the honeysuckle ans feel the dew on my skin.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun I m totally addicted to this game u will love it to hope that you enjoy the game as much as I do its spectacular and the color is unbelievable to
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Interesting plot line but I did not like the jumping around so I could not get into the novel. I liked the characters and the personalities.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|What a great plot, broken chapters to keep you interested and your brain firing to remember where everyone is and what they are doing! Any one who likes mystery stories will enjoy this even though its a different genre.
0307155102|5.0|I got this for my daughter because I grew up reading these books.  This book couldn't be more perfect.  My daughter's in the phase of pointing to everything saying \\"this\\", \\"that\\" and most of the time it's hard to tell what she's pointing at.  Now every page has more and more pics and word for us to work through.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is a riveting movie that steals your attention and doesn't let go until the story is done.  The film keeps pacing just right and has enough action and enough dialog to make it so that the ending, while already known is actually engrossing.  Normally I find true to life films tedious because they take short cuts which hurt the story line or make it seem all Hollywood. This story keeps you engaged and makes you realize how much you want to see how the story plays out even though you know how. This is a dynamic film which I strongly recommend.
0385536828|3.0|...but still a difficult read.<br /><br />I'm rating Sweet Tooth three stars strictly based on my overall lack of enjoyment in reading it.  While appreciating Mr. McEwan's stylistic abilities (ask him to describe anything and he'll do so with impressive form), I just never got interested in the characters or the story for more than a few pages here and there.  I've had this problem with other of McEwan's books -- Saturday, for instance -- so now I'm concluding his work is not for me.  This is an instance of a \\"critic's darling\\" who makes me feel inferior as a reader, like I'm missing something.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This book was extremely e njoyable. So many twists and turns to keep you interested. I would highly recommend it.
0307595862|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars)<br /><br />This was my first venture into Jo Nesbo's series of Hole detective novels, and it won't be my last.  I found the story to be lively and exciting to want to read others in the series, but I do understand and share the frustration of some readers who found The Snowman hard to get into.  In the book's first third, the author made plot moves I didn't always follow and/or didn't make sense to me.  Once the more direct duel between detective Hole and the killer began, though, I was into the story and read it through with pleasure.  Now I'm trying to decide whether to go back and try to catch up with earlier Hole volumes, or to jump ahead and read The Leopard and The Phantom next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so engaging!  Well-written scripts for every episode with superb acting by all.  Maggie Smith is a hoot in her role.  I watch very little TV because of time limits and because of the limited quality of most standard TV.  However Downton Abbey offers so much in the complexity and intrigue of its myriad plots and sub-plots.  Since I watch almost no TV, I had not heard of it until a few months ago when a friend assured me I would love watching it - and I absolutely do!
B004G7UTXG|5.0|The acting is superb but the story is an awakening.  Would recommend to anyone.  I still don't understand the reason the spanish and portuguese wanted this land but intend to do some research.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Extremely funny story interwoven into the history of the last 100 years. Highly recommended even if you are into the latest best sellers
0823015033|5.0|Anyone working in polyclay should have this book on their reference shelf.  It's priceless for the beginner and even the intermediate to advanced polyclay artists are likely to find some handy hints here.  Not only does it tell you what tools you need to get what effects (and it has photos of it ALL) it also tells you how to make a complete set of tools, too, from, what else?  Polyclay. Gorgeous artwork, great photos, full disclosure instructions -- you don't need another instruction book if you have this one.
B009SH5JS4|4.0|I loved this movie in the theatre and on VHS and waited for the Blu-ray addition.  It was as good as the theatre version in my opinion as I recall.  The Pioneer BDP-120 blu-ray player didn't like it however, and it took several tries and many minutes to get it to play.  It wasn't the player as it read a DVD instantly so either this disc has an issue or the security coding on the Blu-ray caused the problem as it has on other releases.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This movie carried that same fantasy, sort of dream-like element that Pan's Labryinth had to me.  The characters were believable and if you believe in spirits the story was even more gripping.  I was left with a bit of a chill not because of the violence or how they depicted the spirit of Mama, but because of the story of how she came to be that way.  It was a great story and a beautiful ending.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this and will probably add it to my permanenet collection to re-watch again.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I bought this book on my kindle for a very small price, and was delightfully surprised by the depth of the plot and the interesting characters.  Some of the dialogue was written in Irish brogue, which slowed down the reading process.  There were some nice surprises along the way.
B0068AWO00|5.0|It has David Tennant, enough said. But really it was a good play on the orignal and collin ferral did a good jerry.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|I only watched a little of it, and what I saw was enjoyable. So many things to do, so little time.
1401322786|5.0|Great book. What a page turner and easy read. I wanted to savor it after it was finished. At the on set I tried to figure out how all the people would collide, was I surprised.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Well done, well acted film. Enjoyable, but subject is troubling. All of it could be fact, so that's what's troubling.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so cool!!!! i love playing it. i play it all the time. i also  love the updates!!!!!
B000ZP9PYM|5.0|I bought a black pair previously and they are very good in the professional  kitchen especially with the nonslip soles and they're lightweight. Since it's such a great price , I got a second pair !
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As I have said on other reviews, I'm a casual gamer and as such, don't have really high expectations.  I expect to be entertained for a few hours.  This game fulfilled it though there were a few programming glitches.  These were specific to when viewing a detail of a scene and instead of seeing some message game related, a subroutine name or function would pop up.  OTOH, this did not interfere with my playing, just found it kind of amusing.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|...But if you have read Lee Child and you DO know who Jack Reacher is then this film is just ridiculous. I have admittedly been a fan of Lee Child and will likely continue to read his books but I will no longer recommend his work. This is perhaps the biggest sell out in the history of films adapted from books. It is understandable that the author gives up to the studio a certain amount of control over storyline, character development, etc but this has to be the biggest departure in history of a character developed over years and more than a dozen books. Jack Reacher is 6'-5\\" tall, 220-250 lbs with a 50\\" chest, which is nearly a full foot taller and 100 lbs heavier than the actor cast for this roll, Tom Cruise. More importantly though is the way that a guy this big carries himself and is perceived by others, something that is impossible for someone 5'-6\\" to pull off. Reacher has massive hands and can kill someone with one punch which is something that is impossible to be portrayed by someone of Cruise's size.  Yes, this would be an okay film if the title was, \\"Ethan Hunt\\" or \\"Mitch McDeere\\" but as Jack Reacher it is a big loser. Oh, and not to beat a dead horse but I think that there is something very wrong when the local law enforcement person - who is typically a beautiful \\"girl-next-door\\" woman that Reacher ultimately sleeps with-is taller than Reacher himself. Yes, all you (former) Lee Child fans, the leading lady in this film, Rosamund Pike is 2-3\\" taller than Cruise. Yeah, Child, that REALLY works in cementing that Reacher character that you spent so many years developing! Shame on you Lee Child for selling out.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am a casual gamer, let me state that right up front.  I enjoyed playing this game though I got through it in a few hours.  Graphics were good and no glitches.
B008Q0AZVK|3.0|Great sexy movie.  Really liked it.  Not really a Robert Pattison fan, but he was pretty good here.  Uma Thurman was as well.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|One of the best films I have seen this year and a great insight to modern day France, great humour
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love mystery stories and mystery games...with this you get both! Unravel the mystery as you go along and play mini puzzles and searches.  Fun way to pass the time!
B0043X1FL8|5.0|I saw this film many years ago and it has lost non of the impact it made on me then, absolutely timeless
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I found the directing uneven and sloppy.<br />Garbage of the highest quality.<br />I watched about a half an hour before I turned it off.<br />Hey Amazon: can I get a refund a movie if its really bad???
B00B22IJXK|4.0|I think that this a wonderful app better than other thats for sure i got on sale so i didnt pay anything but even so its definitly worth 99c i would have put 4 1/2 stars if i could though it would be nice with a bigger colour wheel and perhaps tracers? or premade shapes if that would be added in the next update i'd give this app one-hundred stars nothing but good in my eyes. (note: daughter of LifeDontWasteIt)
B00632HWOG|5.0|I was very pleased with the Yahoo app's and will order from them again. I use it on my Kendall with ease.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This cd is one of the best that I have bought from Amazon. I got it within a week and I play it all of the time
B007PS0DTI|5.0|Kate. She's freakin fierce. This is par for the course in this saga of the Underworld. I won't say that Colleridge's law of willing suspension of disbelief is unnecessary here, but that's what a film like this is all about. One needs these kinds of films in order to stay sane, with all the ugliness of reality around us, apocalyptic films play a healthy role of - if nothing else - showing us how much worse it might get. LOL
B003JUGQ38|5.0|What a sassy companion! The Doctor/Donna combo totally rocks and it's nice to see The Doctor with someone who pushes back now and again (and again and again, lol)
B0050XFY4O|3.0|If you can get past the incestuous theme of the movie, it's not bad. One of the more unusual and unique movies I have seen.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|You would be making a serious mistake to not watch anything that Ang Lee directs.  Life of Pi is a truly beautiful movie.  The cinematography is fabulous, the music is unforgettable and the story is both frightening and touching.  This was the best movie by far that I watched from 2013.
0470474874|4.0|Very helpful except for the PDF ebook on CD.  Examples using screen shots are out of focus,  need to continually refer back to book  .
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I don't usually bother writing reviews on Amazon, but this book was an exception. Reviews are generally praising on the site, but I really don't understand why. The individual characters being interviewed all sound the same and have the same shallow attitude towards the events. The geo-politics in the book also do not make much sense and betray a bit of a one-sided world view on the side of the author.<br /><br />The idea of the book is good, but the writing and storytelling is simply awful.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I enjoyed this book which gave me many points to think about. Practical without being preachy. I plan to read more of her work.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Action packed and full of intrigue! Arrow is not perfect, but he has character! We would like to see more moral character!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Love everything about this movie.  I can't wait to watch Iron Man 3.  Robert Downey Junior is an amazing actor.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|Exclellent tool for my Kindle Fire<br /><br />Just what I needed.  It feels like I am using my Hp 12 c
B006GWO5NE|5.0|great, could not download wireless (lol) tried for over an hr.. this worked right off the bat.  Definitely recommend it
B00005JKDR|5.0|I bought this for my grand daughter don't no if she's watched it yet but her mom likes this movie to.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|This is a classic movie that finally got a decent transfer.  It is way better than the previous release and worth the money in my opinion.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Great album delivered right to my door for a good price. Wish Rodriguez was still recording. Hard to understand how this guy never made it big. Altough he kind of did in South Africa.
1582406723|5.0|The graphic novel itself is wonderful.  Its a gripping story and the art is great.  The quality of the bound comic book is very good quality.  Until my cat dumped water on it..
B009R659L8|5.0|I have enjoy reading Mary Higgins Clarks book for many years as well as her daughter Carol Higgins Clarks.  This book Daddy's Gone a Hunting was one of her best books that she has put out.  This one was more close to home as far as life events that happens to real people.  I would recommend the reading.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This calendar links my computer, phone and Kindle Fire to one calendar.  Excellent options to work with and has reminders with repeat options also.
B005RAQRQO|5.0|MH was suggested by friend that loved it. Ditto for me..Comes so close to being a prefect Motown soul CD.
193700788X|1.0|This has to be one of the most disjointed and jumbled attempts to write an ending that would pull all the pieces together that I have ever had the misfortune to wade through. The characters were lame and very little background was provided to explain certain actions taken by key players (example: Karen..Eric's other child).Where the hell did she come from?<br />I cannot believe that I paid $ 16.00 plus for the e-book version, just to find out that it was such a waste of money.WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is a must have item for sharing your favorite photos!<br />Very easy to use, from camera to iPad in less than a minute!
B0084I9QIW|2.0|Althought the conert is a great concert, the video was not HD.  Having never purchased a dvd I learned that lesson to see if it is listed.  I would hope that sellers would point out whether or not the dvd is hd or not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 5 and 6 year old girls love this game. They love petting, feeding, and doing the competitions. They also enjoy taking pictures of their horses. Great game for kids!
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you are a fan of the greatest Boxing movie of all time then this set is for you. Includes all of the movies, even Rock 5 which was the worst with Tommy Gun.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really like this game. Graphics are awesome, colorful, crisp and clear. I especially like the contours on the world map, mountains on land and in the ocean and shading for vegitation. The mechanics of the different infections and thier evolution is both facinating and scary. Feels close to reality, though I don't know if it really is. Plays and looks great on my Kindle Fire.
0985081821|4.0|Sophia finds herself living in a small town, feeling like an outcast by the overly Christian women who feel her own Wiccan Religion is evil and should be run out of town. Not only does she have to deal with feeling like an outcast, she also has to live with a constant buzzing in her head, and even though she manages to go to college and hold down a job it still rattles around her head 24/7. She just wants to be normal and find a cure for this infliction. That is until she finds herself thrown into the middle of a centuries old battle between supernatural beings, and now her priorities have to change. She has to find out about her own ancestry and decide to join this battle in order to save the ones she loves.<br /><br />This was my first taste at the genre of New Adult and I wasn't disappointed. Rebecca Hamilton has created an intriguing cast of characters all with unique personalities, and powers. Sophia is definitely a girl that can stand on her own without a boyfriend, even with Charles's assistance in the story, she would never be considered weak and that's what I loved about her. Charles on the other hand, for being a paranormal creature, was definitely connected with his humanity and I could see he really cared about Sophia and tried to help her even though she just wanted to do her own thing at times.<br /><br />Hamilton has done her research into both the lores of the supernatural creatures she has written about and Wiccan Religion, which is obvious with her in-depth descriptions of rituals done throughout the book. At times the pace felt a bit too slow, for romance fans this might be just right, but once all the mystery surrounding Sophia's ancestry started unravelling and the twists and turns leading up to the climax started playing out it kept me wanting to turn the page.<br /><br />Overall, this was an exciting read with great characters which is a must read for any fans of paranormal romance or urban fantasy.
B00933JL0A|3.0|Decent graphics. Simple game play easy to learn. Really slow though with nothing special going on. Same old build woodcutter's hut, cut wood, build house, get more workers, build fish hut, get fish. Didn't take forever to load on my Fire. Hadn't frozen or crashed yet, so its ok. Won't be paying for the full version though.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|You can only play 5 times per day, unless you BUY additional plays.  I wont buy, so I'm limited to 5 plays.  So it is OK,  your play is one minute to get rid of diamonds. After 5 plays, it is enough for me.
B0085RZ9C4|5.0|Dawkins is witty without being acidic, intelligent without talking over your head. Some middle chapters are a little challenging, but did not affect my overall impression of this book as being the single most important book I have ever read. I've questioned things for the last 10 years of my 50 total and teetered on the edge of apology until recently.  This book put me firmly into the realm of reason. Yes, intelligence is the new sexy and Richard Dawkins is the sexiest man alive.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Could not get the sound to work. Tried another movie to see if it was my system or amazon and (mine worked) the sound works. Was not the first time this happened. Just a note to add on, they called and we figured out that roku settings had to be on stereo. Even though I have 5.1 surround which worked fine before. So much for updating software.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter and I watch this all the time.  We both love it !  This is something special that she does with grandma.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great! Must see. One of the best movies that I seen this year. In fact onne I bought the season, I couldn't stop watching it!
B0012GTZFC|5.0|Easy to read and fits with our own experiences. Will likely buy a copy for each of my board members
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This is an awesome collector's item with the dragon egg. The box itself is beautiful. This makes a great gift
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is just the right size for my DSLR and it's toys.  I replaced a bigger one with this one and I am glad I did.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|An inspiration to help facilitate real change in and out of the office. Lean In is an add to every book list.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Love this show! Wish it hadn't been cancelled after just one season. The movie Serenity is a great follow up, but we could have used 5 more seasons.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Fun read that is really fantasy but brings an endless smile and leaves the reader asking for more of the characters escapades.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|The circus was always an amazing thing to me.  The Cirque du Soleil compared to what I remember when I was kid is infinitely more beautiful and amazing.  We used to just be amazed that people could actually do that stuff.  Now though, it is so much more beautiful.  There is so much more drama.  It is so surrealistic.  The whole thing felt like a dream.  And, for those of you, like me, who care about it, it is also very clean.  I wouldn't hesitate showing this movie to anyone of any age<br /><br />It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  Truly dazzling.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I have been a DM fan for close to 30 years.  I continue to be amazed at the music that they produce.  This disc took a couple of listens to really grasp where they were going.  The more I listen, the more I love it.  I have never been disappointed by them and look forward to seeing them in concert once again in September!
1569242739|5.0|Since i received the book , im start to bake, the flavor was great, the instructions are very easy, and the cupcakes looks great and taste really yummy. I cant wait to make the frosting. I recommend this book......The thing that i like most, is the fact that recipes dont have eggs, and i dont have the odor of eggs, is awsome...
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I saw this group on 'SNL' one night and loved the songs that they played.  I got the disc in hopes that it would be just as good.  It has grown on me after several listens.  I look forward to what they will do next.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I love reading books about special forces, but this book shows the other side to the story as well as the Hardcore SEAL side. The description of Brown as a normal, redneck kid from Arkansas really made it seem like I was reading about myself. To read of the struggles and challenges this man overcame just to give the ultimate sacrifice is truly inspiring. Awesome book!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|And I love history about Lincoln, but I was disappointed to find very little about him, or his family, it was mostly politics.
B00821OX98|5.0|finally scfi as it should be just awesome a must see if you like syfi  would recomend as a must watch
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book really made me laugh. It was a great romp through history and it really went quick. I hope Jonasson writes another fun book soon!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington at his very best!  So well written and performed that you can't take your eyes off the screen from the beginning to the end.  Brilliant!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Many years ago the first game I bought for my first PC was Mahjongg. This version brings back loads of pleasant memories. 5stars!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Vikings is definitely the best show on TV in a long time and may be in the top 5 of all time.  The show is amazing, the history in the show is amazing, and they had better start making more!
B008KEQMDC|5.0|Cute movie! I bought it for myself when I found out I was pregnant. Great gift for a soon to be momma! :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I grew up with my little pony. I love being able to build my towns and make pony friend with everything. It keeps me entertained for a long time. I look forward to e a chance game
B00ATSS73U|5.0|I love this CD and I want to buy more so I can give them as gifts. Thank you for helping me resolve the problem I had before.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Audio is clear and the auto connect is a good feature,  this shipped from UK in 11 days cheapest route to CA,<br />It sometimes connects too well 25 ft from car, so the car answers.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Loved It. A Very good movie , Loved the fact that it was based on a true story. watched it twice.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. But it seems like the last few books in the series havent been as good as the first books. I feel that a lot of loose ends werent tied up and there was no closure to the seriees.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Watched first on HBO but had to buy to watch again to catch what I missed before. Highly recommend this.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Highly recommend this movie. It's a feel good, hilarious movie. I watched it several times. The story is very good.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Pretty formulaic movie plot. It had the same cliches and twists I expected. It is not a movie you need your brain for, everything is spelled out and easily explained. But that is what I was looking for on this day, so good enough.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This  book kept me engaged from the beginning to the end. I didn't exactly like how it ended. Many crazy twists and surprises. I would recommend this book.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is so different that the only way to understand it is to see it, so go ahead and see it.  As in \\"Crash\\" we are introduced to a cast of characters that seemingly have nothing in common.  However, as the plot unfolds, we come to find that they have everything in common.  Great acting, amazing special effects, all-around great 3 hours of entertainment.
0553801473|2.0|Too long, Too wordy, and nothing happens. This is the first time in the series where I started skimming pages because of redundant detail that just wasn't necessary. The last two books could have been condensed into one, and it could have been kept to under 800 pages. Before I buy the next book I'm going to skim the chapter titles and see who's perspective they're written in, and that will determine whether or not I read it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|There is a reason that the classics have become classics. Definitely worth the read. While the period English can be a bit difficult to read at times, the story will be worth it. Once you get past the language, it is an engrossing read. Enjoy!
B00BC5FN2C|3.0|Kevin Spacey plays a corrupt poltician perfectly...In fact the entire cast is perfect.  There are plenty of other reviews here to tell you more about the show I just wanted to weigh in with my 2 cents about purchasing this package.  I gave it 3 stars purely because the show deserves 5 but paying $40 for it knocks off 2.  You can subscribe to Netflix for under $8 and watch every episode in one month.  You could unsubscribe and re-subscribe 4 additional times just to watch House of Cards and you would just be breaking even after buying this set.  If you love the series that much then that is fine.  You may just feel like you need to own it.  No problem with that.  I just wanted to warn those that have heard good things, want to watch the series, and might have purchased this not knowing that it is included in the subscription price for Netflix.
0062082353|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  Chris Kyle was a true warrior and I love his sense of humor and he was humble and cared deeply for his fellow troops and our country.  I have the utmost respect for this man.  He was trained to kill and he loved it.  He always wanted to be in the action.  This is not a boring book!  What a loss that he was murdered by a vet.  We lost a good man.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works as well and as easily as specified. Charges a  Kindle Fire HD in about 5 hours which is fast compared to chargers for competitors tablets. Once again, great product.
0307730697|5.0|This was an awesome book about a real hero!  I have the utmost respect for Adam Brown after reading this book.  I highly recommend this book.  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  My heart goes out to his wife, kids and family.  He was so brave and a very unique man.  Thanks Adam for serving our country.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Solitaire is one of my favorite games.  Very relaxing for me.  And now with it on my<br />Kindle Fire it's great.
B0064MGU98|3.0|This series titillates with echoes of political news past, present, and alas future, with a nod to fads, and manages to deliver interesting food for thought.  It kept me watching with moderate interest.
B009X01ELC|5.0|After reading reviews and making comparisons, I'm glad I chose this, the Marware. It securely holds my Kindle, and can disply landscape or portrait. It doesn't add a lot of bulk.  It's very sleek and easy to keep clean since it is the black or charcoal leather.  Very pleased with the quality of the product!! I would recommend it to friends!
B00000J2SO|5.0|I think Roger Glover more than made up for him with the production of this album.  It's not as hard rocking as other Rainbow albums.  Despite that it takes me back to my discovery of rock during my formative years.  I just put on 'Since You've Been Gone', and I'm back in a basement in western Pennsylvania playing the crap out of my dad's Rickenbacker 4001 (along with Roger of course).
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is very helpful for weather conditions and warnings about severe weather, including hail damage and severe weather warnings and alerts
B006BAEQB2|3.0|I've read many Philippa Gregory books and have given them as gifts.  This story starts rather intriguingly, and, of course, I realize that it's based on how history has recorded it, however, it became rather dreary, depressing and the end left me, like, thud.  Why did I bother.  In Gregory's Henry VIII tales it seems that she was able to paint the pictures somewhat colorful even when times and situations absolutely weren't!  Now I'm not looking for made-up fiction or pollyanna stories - however, I do enjoy a read that relates a journey that's interesting, enlightening and worthwhile.  This book, not so much.  If you're new to Ms Gregory, select an earlier one.
B008MM9630|4.0|Just started, having a lot of fun. Can't wait to see what happens next. Love that I am in charge.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read, very suspenseful, the author keeps you guessing. My only complaint was I was left wanting more. I would recommend it
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I will absolutely not support any game I don't care what it is that has in app purchasing as part of the game after I already paid for it once. No way, no how, not ever.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Levels are beautifully made and puzzles solvable with occasionally a clue or two which are also included. Hope to see more levels soon!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The story took too long to develop.  The basic plot is good.  It was an easy read with a happy ending.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love love love this book. It took you on a journey through the mind of a person deemed mentally ill. From his perspective. It was very moving.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and this was a decent movie adaptation. In some ways, it is better, because you are saved from a ton of teenage angst thoughts! There is a lot of violence, as these children are required to kill each other, so be aware.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|updates are awesome my only problem is sometimes it starts skipping and I lose but other than that very decent game
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was hesitant about acquiring this but my daughter mentioned she would like to see this.  It had already been shown locally at the theatres.  So I bought it - in the meantime her daughter downloaded it so they watched it - however the DVD was on its way.  SOooooo,  I decided to watch it -  I was mesmerized. In fact I had to go Google the story behind this to understand the symbolism of the animal characters....... Then invited a friend to watch together - she was delighted/intrigued as well.  (for two somewhat talkative women - both very silent as we watched - now that's a true recomendation).  This is the type of movie that &#34;stays with you&#34; - wondering if I should also read the book even though I'm sure the movie did it credit.  Somewhat mystical so may not be for those who have difficulty suspending logic to be carried by the story.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|My daughter turned me on to OneRepublic a few years back with &#34;Dreaming Out Loud.&#34;  &#34;Native&#34; is great music.  I can buy their music without listening beforehand and have never been disappointed.
B00BPXKWGS|4.0|The first thing I did after receiving this was pop in the live in Greensboro disk.  Highlights include Michael Stipes vocals on every track, most notably 'world leader pretend' are amazing.  The sound quality on this rocks.  If there is any drawback to this it would be the absence of the five live songs R.E.M. released last month on record store day.  The five songs though not in particular order are: 1) I remember California, 2) feeling gravity's pull, 3) king of birds, 4) South Central Rain, and 5) strange.  But when you look at what is on this, you got heavy hitters like life and how to live it, begin the begin and orange crush.  All in all R.E.M. continues rewarding fans long after breaking up in Fall 2011.  They are the ultimate alternative rock band and this disk shines accordingly.  Enjoy
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Her stuff is filled with grandeur and optimism and is simply incredible. Have a listen to the samples and you will begin to get the idea.
B004FRB3OQ|4.0|I buy these for a network affiliated television station in a top 30 market, and we have been using these since we went to a file-based field workflow almost two years ago.  These adapters have saved us thousands and thousands of dollars over SxS media cards.  We use them with high-end SanDisk SDHC cards, and they work very reliably in our Sony PMW-350 cameras and EX-30 decks.<br /><br />We tested several generic SDHC-to-ExpressCard adapters, and none of them worked with the cameras or the decks. You gotta have an adapter specifically designed to replace SxS.<br /><br />They're not perfect.  We have had about 10 failures out of approximately 80 adapters purchased to date.  These are not DOA situations, they all worked initially but just stopped after a year or so.  We haven't lost any footage, cause once the camera or deck has recognized them you're good to go. They just don't get recognized when they fail.  So buy more than one if you're going this route.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I never thought I would be so entranced by this show.  I am on season three and loving it!  Enjoy
8866131369|5.0|I've been using mine for the last year.  The binding is flawless and the format is perfect for the daily, weekly and monthly notes I take.  Great long and short range management tool.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Best show in Television. Thank you HBO. I don't like having to wait until the subsequent season starts before prior season is released.
B005GSY23M|5.0|I pretty much listen to this when I drive. So the name of the album is perfect, I feel like a real human being. And a real hero.
B000050HTO|1.0|In my opinion, ( I threw that in to be nice ) the CDs that I have heard from the \\"Essential\\" series represent everything that is wrong with the remastering of classic music for release on CD. Give me a break! If you remove the grit and rasp from Dylan's voice, it no longer sounds like Dylan! I like my classic rock to sound the way I remember it sounding when I first heard it. The tracks on this CD sound nothing like the original recordings. If you want to purchase compilation CDs of Dylan's music, look for \\" Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits  1,2,& 3\\" origanally released on vinyl on the Columbia label.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|i got him an extra copy to get signed at the recent C2E2 conference in the chicago area - he spent his money on other things, and didn't get it signed, but he still enjoys NPH and this dvd!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This is a well done point and click with a good story and graphics. It's in three parts, all here for $1.25. Google play offers the first installment for free, then $.99 for each of the two other parts. Buy it all here, save a few cents and avoid the nagware on Google asking you to buy the next installment. Great job icoolgeeks.
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|I always enjoyed the StaTrek TNG and now have been able to have it from start to finish at my pace.
B008JFUMDS|5.0|I just saw this movie at a screening tonight and more than once the audience cheered and clapped with excitement. This is and intelligent, entertaining film that's fun, funny, and exhilarating -- refreshing in the summer of sequel blockbusters a la Ocean's Eleven. I didn't think it'd be this good, but the plot is written extremely well. I don't want to spoil anything, thus I'll just say that this is one of the best executed cat-and-mouth chases I have seen where everything is truly an illusion.<br /><br />Don't blink, or you'll miss a lot of the intricacies of the plot. This is definitely a movie to watch and rewatch several times.
B000N90JGI|5.0|i love the movie because both actorsis great and it is a wonderful story line and good ending as well
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Read all the Reacher books great character. Excellent storyline, gripping adventure and such a tough guy the best. Great read.
1609611543|3.0|I appreciated the amount of research that went into writing the book.  That said... about 75% of it read like a textbook, in my opinion.<br />I felt so much better after eliminating the wheat altogether, but didn't lose a pound.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Read all the Reacher books great character. The life of Reacher just foes on and on and grows with every new book
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. The movie has an interesting plot, and an incredible cast.  It is easy to see why Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar for her incredible performance as a young woman overcoming many obstacles in her life. Bradley Cooper, likewise, gave an outstanding performance in his role as a man learning to cope with his issues as well.<br /><br />I especially liked being able to download this movie on my Kindle because I was able to watch it on my own time, and I could take it with me if I wanted to watch it when I was away from home. I also loved the fact that I could watch a movie with a more adult theme without worrying about my children trying to watch it too.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|History, and real characters like a trip back in time and the sequel to the best book I have ever read The Pillars of the Earth.
B00633W614|5.0|After reading the first book in the series I had to continue on with the second to find out what happens.  Now I have to read the third book to finish the story line.  This is a trilogy that you want to keep on until the end !
1451695195|4.0|Interesting read.....some odd stuff, but overall thought provoking.  Interesting to read the experience of a doctor that previously denied that NDEs were real.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|the book was so awesome and enjoyable....you will never think of flowers in the same way ever again.  the author was so in depth with keeping the sstory a surprise
B00CGG5FEM|4.0|This product is $35 at the lego store and $50 at the toy store. Which is a lot for sch a small lego set, but its a great set.  Why would anyone pay $168 for this?  Have you people lost your minds?
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Very easy to use.  Seem to be of great quality.  I have received several compliments on the case.  I am ordering another case for my mom.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Well this app isn't well put together.Don't get it when it times you it gives you 60 seconds I don't know why I wasted free space on this........And on the kindle fire it shows half of the screen this SUCKS.
B0097K21YW|3.0|its a cool game to waste time on. big lizard shooting fire balls at little buildings , even challenging at times
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Great movie. Kids have loved it for years. Colorful and imaginative. A+. John Goodman is at his finest. Would rent again, and probably will.
0345529057|2.0|I bought these after watching the first season of the TV series.<br /><br />Reading about the events that had passed in the series, gave more insight into what was going on, more detail. In that sense I would recommend these books. If you like the series, get these for additional reading.<br /><br />However, halfway through the second book I was getting tired of the constant warring. By a quick browse forward, that is not about to change. The whole series is about war, war, and more war. I decided to let that be after the second volume, and sold these.
B0059IVV9M|5.0|I loved this CD and I love Beirut. The pakcaging was great, no cracks when it came. I loved the music as well. It plays very clearly and the piano on this CD is great. Loved it.
B0035G1K7S|5.0|I only recently found White Stripes and after listening to their music for a while, I found a clip of this document on the Internet. It intrigued me and I decided to buy it.<br /><br />I like the stylishness of the film. Of the band. Both the live performances and the documentary part are well done.<br /><br />Jack does a lot of explaining in the interview parts, which gives insight into to band. Meg doesn't talk much, but she's filmed calm and reflecting in some really nice scenes.<br /><br />The Blu-ray was region 0, so it plays anywhere, which is nice.<br /><br />Overall, I really love it!
B000UJ48XG|5.0|Really great product. It plays wonderfully and the music is beatiful and aesthetic. Beirut is a great band and great musician. Wonderful CD.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book about heaven especially from a neurosurgeon's point of view. He breaks it down scientifically.  A must read for those of who logical but want to have more faith.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was very entertaining to play and I didn't want to put my Kindle down. I hope The Room 2 is longer.
1449437524|5.0|if you love the oatmeal (and i do) you've probably read this comic. great coffee table book that surprises readers - Hilarious.
B0057R5G6E|4.0|Have to say that it was a good addition to my collection. Love the look of the T-Rex and really like the included extras.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|If you don't mind going back and forth to locations to achieve the goals you'll love this game. Has seek and find and mini games. Its entertaining and makes you come back for more. If you get stuck there's a map that helps guide you plus a hind button.  Also has achievements. Really fun game.<br />Only down side is I think its a bit expensive for the full version.  Its cheaper than a movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were well written and thought provoking.  The characters were interesting and well defined.  You felt that you got to know them quite quickly and felt like they were friends.  You really started to care about them and what was going to happen to them.  The entire trilogy had a deep underlying feeling of sadness and darkness.  There were so very few happy times but they were short lived and were easily overtaken by more sad events.  I have to admit that as much as I liked the story I felt depressed through just about the entire trilogy.  Even the ending had a depressing feel to it even though the main lead female character did end up with the man you thought she would.  What happened to her little sister was heartbreaking and you never did know how things turned out with her mother at the end.  It was a good story but there was so much sadness and negative situations that even though you wanted to keep going to find out how it was all going to turn out, there were times when you needed a break from all the pain and grief.  Having said that, I would still recommend this trilogy for the idea behind the story which could possibly happen sometime in the distant future.  It was for me a combination of fantasy, science fiction and thriller.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love reading novel series! This one, i didnt put down till i finished it! Cant wait for themovie versions of Catching Fire and The Mockingjay!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can play over and over again, looking for new patterns and challenging myself to be faster.  Of course I also like the fact that I can replay levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome most fun ever.it makes me want to play everyday I always chart me kindle all the way that I can play a long tome
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Story seems at first to be something you've seen before but quickly intrugued me with its nuances and excelent preformance by the lead actress Tatiana Maslany. I realy believe when she's portraying the diffrent clones on screen at the same time. That they are their own unique characters.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young can be self indulgent whenever he likes. Latest outing with Crazy Horse. Recommend. Not many artists do 22 minute tracks any more.<br />You used to get it all, now you only get 5%. Sad but true
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|The moment I found out Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix were in this movie I wanted to see it... and I wasn't disappointed.  The story appears to be about a broken, emotionally unhealthy WWII Veteran who suffers from both PTSD and (you later find out) a turbulent upbringing who literally stumbles upon a self-proclaimed, new-agey spiritual leader (who seems a bit suspect) and what happens when their lives intersect for a time.  When the movie came out there was speculation that Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character and spiritual movement (\\"The Cause\\") were loose interpretations of L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology and after viewing \\"The Master\\" I can see the connection.<br /><br />This movie was very good, very real and very raw.  It wasn't a feel good story, but it had some bright spots of humor and compassion and I found it extremely thought provoking.  \\"The Master\\" is the type of movie to watch and then sit over a cup of coffee and discuss with a friend - lol.  I'm surprised at the low ratings... it was a very interesting story and the acting was excellent by all.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|The concert is really nice, and the extras too, the third part of the history is a little bit shot but is nice
B00307OTDE|5.0|He's one of the greats, and first in a lot of the things that he and later, others did.  His use of amplifier was ahead of his time, his love for his music is palpable, and his sweet riffs were just what I needed.<br /><br />All along the watchtower, I know it's a Bob Dylan song but this version rocks....<br /><br />worth the price alone... but every song on the album is gold.<br /><br />dmz
B0095G5AFU|4.0|For those of you who are complaining that the Pro version is the same as the free version, you're wrong. The pro version is ad-free. I, personally felt it was worth it to get rid of the constant ad that was taking uo space. It was worth 99 cents to get rid of it. So... if you don't mind the ads...stick with the free version.<br /><br />As for the app ... it's pretty decent. I have downloaded a few of these notebook type of apps and I think I've decided on this one as my favorite.
0307950689|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  Characters real and sympathetic.  Relationships, on the whole, believable and interesting.  Well researched and portrayed.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter loves Tinkerbell! And now she has a sister! Even better! My little girl LOVES watching this over and over again!
1432794426|5.0|Dr, Karen Moriarty has done a sterling job in defending the king, as the title suggests. Whilst never shying away from the facts, she gives a clear, unbiased look into the life of Michael Jackson, who is not only the king of pop, but the king of hearts. Anyone who ever doubted the truth about him should read the book to see the real happenings, which are so different to the blurred, unjust writings in the tabloids. Dr Moriarty shows us the real man behind the mask, showing the fun and the immense sadness in the life of a man so often misunderstood.<br />Whilst her love for him is clear, she has also remained factual as we can clearly see as Tom Messerau himself endorses the book. The book brought many smiles to my face and many tears too. Thank you to Dr Karen Moriarty for defending Michael, our king, so beautifully
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter even dressed up as her at Disneyland! It is was funny, romantic, and oh so entertaining!! Love It!!!!
030758836X|4.0|This is a good book that keeps you guessing throughout. There are three sections and each section has a completely different perspective. The book alternates between two narrators, and clearly utilizes the unreliable narrator technique. I will say that I couldn't put this book down, and I was impressed that I was really surprised by the directions the book took.<br /><br />My only issue is the ending. I won't give anything away, but while it wasn't a horrible ending, it was definitely not close to par with the rest of the book. I went back to make sure I hadn't skipped a few pages at the end, which is never a feeling I love when I've supposedly \\"finished\\" a book.<br /><br />This book is a unique exploration into the lives of Amy and Nick Dunne, and it's worth reading if you can forgive an unsatisfying end.
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|Great actors with occassionally funny banter, but the plot left much to be desired.  I wanted to like this and couldn't even bring myself to watch all of it.
B00CBKLO52|5.0|I thought this was great.....I enjoyed the ease of use, realistic flying and my ability to start immediately....Great for children also.
B006M4F67A|5.0|What can I say? I dl'd this on my kindle. It is nice to play a game that doesn't involve waiting for an opponent. I am not sure if there's a way to play opponents though.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is one of the favorites in our house. Light, funny, quirky, with a good soundtrack. What's not to like? Better than most romantic comedies and with a bit better vocabulary as well. I recommend this to everyone I meet.
0547258305|4.0|For those of you that are fans of fantasy, mysticism and magic, Graceling by Kristin Cashore is an excellent read!  In a time of kings and queens and betrayal and politics lives a girl Katsa who has a very useful Grace.  Gracelings are blessed with amazing beauty along with a special talent and identified by the mismatched colored eyes.  Many gracelings possess gifts like, storytelling or dancing but Katsa is graced with the gift of fighting, one her kingdom covets and wants to control.  Manipulated into service for the corrupt king, Katsa is sent as a henchwoman to do the king's dirty work and punish those against the king  and to counter and calm her guilt, she forms the Council that acts secretly for justice and fairness for those accused.<br /><br />We meet Katsa on a mission to rescue the Lienid King's father and joins forces with Prince Po, the captive's grandson that sets the path for the two on a very dangerous, exciting and romantic journey.  Each and every character is wonderfully developed and Katsa is a heroine to fall in love with.  She has struggles of her own to overcome and does grow and change as she learns more about herself throughout the pages.  The romance laced throughout are not the main plot but definitly has it's place.  That being said, Graceling, has one of the more true relationships than those in many of the YA books.  I must warn that this romance can become more graphic than I have seen in other books as well and I would suggest the age suggestion of 14+.  This is a beautifully told and adventure packed story of love, fantasy, magic and romance.  It is clear that Cashore has a grace of her own - Excellent Storytelling!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|very entertaining, engrossing, and engaging.  It was a joy to watch the series in close progression on amazon streaming. thank you amazon
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was unaware of the 'orphan trains' history. The novel weaves universal themes with different generations and shows the more things change, the more the themes are the same.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|So from prior reviews I was expecting a short game, but this ended even before I was expecting it to. A decently fun game, but too short none the less. Even if you are truly &quot;stuck&quot; I still wouldn't recommend using the hints. Set it down for a little while and come back to it and you will probably see what you were missing before. All that being said, well worth the two bucks.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Lets be honest. Unless you are doing graphic design, are you ever going to need more than this? I am trying and I can barely make the thing hiccup.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I love this game. I'm so addicted to this game.  It drives my husband nuts because I'm always on it!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Everyone is raving about Jennifer Lawrence's performance but I was actually much more impressed with Bradley Cooper's performance.  I didn't know he had it in him, honestly it was better than Jennifer in my opinion he made the movie for me.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Star trek fan love the show really didn't into Enterprise this show until recently and I realized that it does have a good story line. Its a great show that I highly recommend to Star Trek fans.
B00012QM9K|5.0|We loved the 'package', because it really is a package, not just a movie.  The set contains items that will entertain and spark conversations long after the movie is over (if you ever get to the movie!).  The sound track, film cell and print, the movie, and the box made a wonderful gift for Mother's Day.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome Movie...We watched it on our new Samsung 55 inch 3d, good quality and it was a nice movie.  I watched it for the first time, in 3d.
B004BA5FDC|5.0|This book is life changer. It's a must read. It will change the way you think for sure. Try it today
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is my favorite of the books so far.  it moved quickly through events and kept me<br />riveted throughout the whole book.  I actually hated to see it end.  It was spectacular!!
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR MY NIECE BECAUSE SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH. SHE WAS THRILLED TO RECEIVE IT AND WATCHES IT ALL OF THE TIME. IT MADE ME A BIG HIT WITH HER.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a lot of fun. If your not careful it's like a runaway train thereos no stoping it.the game is hard to put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The Character development is exceptional and the costume design well researched for the period.  Season 4 does not come fast enough!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Vampire Weekend are an intelligent band, there's no doubt about it, and with their third studio album they highlight their brains without the showy wordplay of their previous efforts. These mature vampires explore personal topics like love and God in a way that is very relatable to fans of all ages. \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" is beautifully constructed from it's overall feel and track list, to each song in and of itself.<br /><br />In \\"Step\\" Ezra Koening sings \\" Wisdoms a gift/But you'd trade it for youth/Age is an honor/It's still not the truth\\". You can feel this very youthful band struggling with their quickly approaching thirties, but aging suits them well. They practice a beautiful restraint that produces seemingly effortless melodies over their trademark shuffle rhythms and background of Rostam Batmaglij's synths.<br /><br />Vampire Weekend have perfected an upbeat modern rockabilly with songs like \\"Finger Back\\" and \\"Diane Young\\". The rhythm section of Chris Baio on bass and Chris Tomson on drums create infections cadences that make you want to dance. The use of auto-tune could be questionable on \\"Step\\" and \\"Diane Young\\" but the songs are so good that it just feels like nitpicking. They explore their softer side with \\"Unbelievers\\", \\"Everlasting Arms\\" and \\"Worship You\\". Three thoughtful songs that remain fun, a very difficult thing to accomplish.<br /><br />\\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" feels very now, very 2013 in a world where we are all connected. There are influences from the past (Paul Simon) and global influences (African rhythms), but presented in a fresh new way. This feeling is represented in \\"Diane Young\\" as Ezra sings \\"Live my life in self-defense/You know I love the past cuz I hate suspense /If Diane Young won't change your mind/ Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time\\".<br /><br />Okay, so the boys still have a bit of fun with wordplay but that's part of the reason that we love them. And if Vampire Weekend can keep creating albums as rich as \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\", we will continue to love them for years to come.  [...]
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Love his voice but remember when the Moody Blues all went solo before coming back together for Seventh Sojourn.  Their solo attempts were, to my ears, somewhat of a train wreck. Justin, however, has a voice that makes me smile like I did in the 70's listening to him. Unless you are a critical type who picks apart music CD's, it is very enjoyable.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The DVD quality was good, the case is pretty, and the movie is AWESOME. I love this new run of Marvel movies, and this one didn't disappoint.
1439190275|5.0|The reading was easy and not hard to follow. I have lost weight and so has my hubby. I recommend this book and couldn't put it down. I have been on many diets but this was the best. I was skeptical about Atkins until my cousin mentioned she was on it. I didn't want to bother with reading a book about dieting but once I started I couldn't put it down. I ended up buying the cookbook! give it a try!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Wish Keith Urban would release a new CD, this CD is so good, can listen to it over and over.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was pleased with the character development and story progression in this movie. A word of caution, however: the violence and dark plot basis of this movie can make it disturbing and hard to watch
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|We are enjoying the new Blake Shelton music.  It is easy to listen to and fun too.  Waiting for his next CD!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great fun to read and discuss with colleagues at work. Team building at it's best and nobody even knew it was happening! .
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|the subject line already says what needs to be said.  amazon didn't do anything special, they just provided the movie.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I like all these kind of games. I think they are fun and really get you to think. I would definitely recommend this.
B004259BMM|5.0|Keith Urban has done it again by creating an album that does not disappoint. Often on an album, you will find at least one song you don't like, but not on this one! Once again Keith has created an album which captures the intimacy and emotion of a man in love.
B009R659L8|5.0|Much better than I thought it would be she keeps you reading and not going to sleep lol she just gets better
B007SGM084|5.0|I would recommend this book and pass along to everyone, that is if you can find a person who has not read it already.  Hard to put down, you never knew what was about to happen or where the book was leading.  Great read, can't wait to purchase more of her books.  Loved the triology.  It could have been longer, I hated to reach the end.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|I love paramore so this CD definitely prepared me for the concert here in Detroit. Hayley ROCKS!! Long live Paramore
B00CI5ET7K|4.0|Satriani continues to branch out and explore new things.  This album is about a new band, not so much radically different music.  It consists of a very solid set of new songs, all with the familiar Satriani style we know and love.  The new band ROCKS and I suspect the economic shakedowns everywhere have allowed Joe to pick up top talent for cheap (relatively).  I will miss his old band though.  I still feel that Mike Kennelly is not being fully utilized as he was in Wormhole Wizards but lets hope Joe's next album and tour will allow these awesome band members to begin to grow with Joe into new heights of musical greatness.<br />Definitely one of his best albums - no doubt about it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Great movie.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I like the technical information he includes within the plot.  Whether or not it is entirely accurate is not the important thing...but holds my attention because it is so believeable.  The down side is that he runs on and on and on in places that make the story drag without having any thing important to add.  Having read The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, and the Lost Symbol  I am looking forward to Inferno.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|not crazy about this app. seems like a sales pitch more than a game and a collection of items rather than strategy
0385349947|5.0|I haven't personally read the book but after reading reviews I decided to buy my daughters a copy.  They were excited to read it because they had heard good things about it.
B00CELB980|1.0|Be aware - this is not the item as stated - i.e. this CD does not contain the 6 remixes stated but just the general 2 track CD - i.e. the Radio edit and 1 other - and for $7 that's taking the 'Mode'.
030758836X|4.0|I had a tough time getting into the story but then it became more interesting.  Very different story line but held my interest.  I can't say I would recommend it even though my daughter liked it and suggested it to me.
B00006879E|4.0|This is the best album by Maroon 5. Some of it is a little too &#34;pop&#34; for my taste, but I love Adam Levine's vocals - his phrasing is unique.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved Season 1!!! This was one of the most heartwarming shows I have seen. I loved it so much that I bought the book for my 89 year old Mom because I know she'll love it.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|You pay .99 cents  and all you get is 6 world's and the it asks you to pay another .99 cents for every 6 worlds after that. I stopped buying my son more world's at world 12. Most of these are repeats from the DS version, so you are not even getting new games. Charge one fee and be done with it. Fix this and I will rate it the 5 stars.
B0015GF4FO|1.0|I really really really really really really really really really dislike the show.<br /><br />I was forced to watch the show for communications 101 class I needed to transfer, so unless you're being forced to watch the show in class you should probably avoid it. If your a professor please do not make this required watching material.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I didn't care for the book in the beginning and I was surprised that this book was a best seller and a movie was made.  It seemed a bit far fetched and too much controversial events going on every time you turn around.  I did get into it a bit in the end however I still think that there was to much tackling of too many issues.  Abortion, molestation, drug use, gay and heterosexual sex,....the list go on....but it did have some thought provoking moments.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|16 bit era arcade style beat-em'-up, with some modern elements.  It can get a bit grindy at times, but it is solid overall.  The art and humor are strong points.  Replay value is good for a phone game.
B008VBYN80|4.0|this game combines the perfect mix of fun and challenge that I love a game to have. I highly recommend this game!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|what can you say.. it's a dictionary. It serves the purpose I got it for. Easy to use and easy to read
B00AMBH70S|3.0|After watching the three episodes of The Bourne Movies this one was a dissapointment,glad I did not buy it for my DVD library.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game so much that this is actual my first review of a game.  I just had to come here and let everyone know how fun it is.  Cool graphics and you will love all the hidden compartments.  Very well made!  I can not wait for another installment!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am 31 years old and have been reading these novels since I was 12.  Many thanks and praise to Mr. Sanderson for ending the series right after the passing of Robert Jordan.  I highly reccomend the series to anyone...you'll want to start at the beginning of course. :-)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Was easy to win in rooms when I first started playing.I think the longer you play the less you win. Everyone in the chat rooms say the \\"Guest\\" players win more than the registered winners.
B007G92QGO|5.0|Excellent book, I found it page turning. Brilliant twist at the end that wanted me wanting more. I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is a really good application. Never freezes. Very easy to use and play. I recommend this application to any and every one.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I love Kate Morton and will definitely be purchasing more of her books.  There is a definite suspense that makes you want to keep turning the pages.  Well done Kate.
B008MEM24S|5.0|If you like &#34;Where's my water&#34;.  &#34;Where's my Perry&#34; is for you too. It's the same general idea with different characters and scenes. I do it at night before bed and then plan my moves in my sleep!
B009X2CUYA|4.0|I think Kate Morton is a great writer and I really enjoyed this book.  Would definitely recommend her books to anyone.
052118939X|5.0|I know lots of grammar books but this is the one I love the most. Information is clear and objective besides the CD-Rom which is simply fantastic .
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Ferris Bueller, Pac Man, Dungeons & Dragons..this book references everything cool from the 80s. It seems a bit more geared towards teen readers than adults, but it was thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.
0521675804|4.0|The book is great! Grammar in Use is undoubtly my Top Favorite one! I just got a little bit bored because the last sample I bought was not properly handled. The cover was a little damaged and folded. The book was actually for a student of mine and she got a bit disappointed when I handed her the book. But the book keeps its word being of great help! It's worth buying it!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Definantly different then the original story but sometimes I like this new version of green arrow better! I give it a 4 out of 5 I can't wait for the next episode each week!!
B008133MDK|5.0|What else can one say?  The writing is incredible and the homage to the originals is very creative.  Very funny as well.
B00005KAQP|5.0|Had to sell a lot fo things when I left Wisconsin for North Dakota.  USA, baby!  Took two weeks to get here, but it worked.
B003FC3LQK|2.0|We turned it off part way through. It seemed to be going nowhere.  The suggestive dancing seemed to have no point.  The story was inane.  Other than that, it was fine.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Our wedding song is on here.  Our first dance will be &#34;I need you now&#34;  cuz it's definitely us.  I ordered two copies, one for his car and one for me.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The first one was better.  I like BD however, it seems to be dragging on a bit.  Not introducing enough twists to really hold interest.  I'm almost finished with it.  Perhaps the ending will redeem the book.
6305433909|5.0|Haven't watched it you so I really can not comment BUT it came the same day as Sister Act 1.  It's obviously been copied, hopefully it will work fine.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|These guys can do nothing wrong in my book.  Okay, the Goblin City scenes were a little bit hokey and seemed to be playing to the future video game franchise.  Radagast was a bit hokey too, but then we skipped ol' Tom Bombadil in LOTR, so maybe this is making up for it.  Other than that, I absolutely loved this film.  The tweaks Jackson worked on the original story line work for me, and the suspense of not really seeing Smaug yet is still killing me.  The Dwarves were awesome, Gandalf was Gandalf and the Bilbo really worked, perhaps better than the actor from LOTR.  Killing me to have to wait unit 2014 for the next one.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I love Alanis.  It was a replacement for a cd I had already owned.  Still has fab as the original.
B008602KQI|2.0|That is an awful story for a PG-13 movie! Acting is OK though. Ending is disappointing; no moral lesson, predictable.
B000002W9Q|4.0|I wanted the Movie, got the soundtrack, again, that's my fault.  I need to pay better attention when I've got happy fingers on the keyboard.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is great! It has the main features that PC  like food, armor, and sky. With the next update that will finally come out this month you will be able to play online and have buckets too. I recommend you get t his app while the price is lowered for amazing features to come with newer updates.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Too bad this show just got cancelled. It was such a good one. Maybe it'll come back sometime again soon.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The movie started out well but I soon found myself loosing interest in the repetitive accounts of drunkenness and repentance.  However, the ending did redeem the movie's shortcomings.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|What an intelligent show! The twists and turns of the legal system are very eye opening.  The characters are well developed and complex.  I am hooked.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Interesting but long especially since you know the outcome. I always wonder where facts end and theatricality begins. Worth it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Typical Baldacci.  He keeps you guessing about what is actually going on until the very end. A quick and entertaining read.
B00004RD54|5.0|This was the first Lou Reed album I ever bought. I just re-discovered it and it sounds as good as it ever did. It may be Lou Reed's most mainstream effort in it's tight musicianship, (Alice Cooper's touring band), but if that helped bring Lou to the masses, it's a good thing! Artists need to survive too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and easy GREAT colorful rated this five stars you can't miss when you purchase way to much fun hope you get it
B008602KQI|4.0|A decent movie with a story line which is unique to other movies. I would recommend watching this unique movie
B0006OBPTA|4.0|very good product to use and highly recommended. useful item if you are interested in buying it. also lasting product.
B004GF5FMI|5.0|This movie is action packed & funny. I love it & never get tired of seeing it. This is a movie I can watch again & again!
B004BCAS4G|5.0|very good product to use and highly recommended. useful item if you are interested in buying it. also lasting product.
1250012570|5.0|Update May 13, 2013:<br />You know those annoying people who are all ZOMG!!1! THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVA! and who insist on telling everyone they meet that they simply MUST read this book right now right now right now?<br /><br />I am that person.<br /><br />And this is that book.<br /><br />I have just finished listening to \\"Eleanor & Park\\" for the second time in as many weeks. I took my time and listened to certain parts twice. I paced myself so I would end each evening on a swoon. I WANTED TO JUMP INSIDE AND MARRY THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Seriously. Go buy your copy NOW.<br /><br />Originally posted May 2, 2013:<br /><spoilers removed><br /><br />There aren't many books that I will borrow from the library, then go out and purchase in multiple forms. This book is right up there with The Fault in Our Stars, Sea of Tranquility, and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society: it will have a spot in my permanent collection.
B008LC8TJI|1.0|Since their early days, Maroon 5's members have had an out of sight ability to multi task. Adam used to play lead guitar and sing. Mickey had the ability to make noises from his bass while sticking one thumb up his behind & looking like a total moron. Catch my drift?<br /><br />Now their multi tasking has reached a level never reached by modern day musicians. They now have the ability to go to the bathroom, drop a deuce and come out with a sparkling new record for all to relish. The kicker? They can do it in 10 minutes or less. Wow Maroon 5!<br /><br />After listening to the album I could not help but notice a certain Maroon 5ish scent. From my vehicle there was a slime green, smoke like matter drifting into my nostrils from the speakers. Instantly I recognized what it was: that fresh laid turd you find after your 280 pound roommate spent his Friday night woofing down a Taco Party Pack of Cool Ranch Taocs from T Bell and beer bonging copious amounts of Mountain Dew's Game Fuel.<br /><br />James Valentine, former band mate and critical component of the band's rock sound in former albums, was excited that he got the album off. He only played on four songs which allowed him to take some much needed time off to lay around, running his fingers through his long hair and ask, \\"how do I get my guitar licks to sound more like Adam's songwriting?\\" He learned how one day while walking his dog Mr. Butterfingers when the dog stopped to take care of his business. His dog went to \\"talk to a man about a dog (a number 2)\\" and that sparked the light bulb inside of Valentine's head.<br /><br />I can not wait until Maroon 5 decides to pass another bowel movement so we can get a bunch of producers together and create music that actually uses no real band members what so ever.
0784011710|5.0|This is a terrific movie. It was suggested to me by a friend. Its very odd through most of the movie but intriguing at the same time. You have to watch all the way through to piece it all together. I am glad to own this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Darn you Hugh Howey!  I've spent the last few days reading Wool at every opportunity, except when interrupted by trivial and less important things like family and work.  Now that I'm done, I'm left with this empty, desperate feeling like an addict that needs their next fix.  What have you done to me Hugh!<br /><br />Seriously, I loved this book.  Great concept, character development and dramatic appeal.  If you are a fan of apocalyptic literature, seasoned with suspense and still believing that there is hope for mankind, then Wool is a must read.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|This has been my favorite movie for years. I just recently purchased it after I realized I didn't own this on DVD. I thought its a must have in my collection so I can share such a beautiful and inspiring movie with my friends and family.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great cast and an extremely well written plot lone makes this movie one of those where you're afraid to leave to room for fear of missing something.  Highly recommend.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Lena Headey is the perfect woman for the role. Beautiful yet strong and serious. The show is good. It keeps loyal to the franchise and mixed things up good enough to make sense. Summer Glau as a Terminator is good. She does a great job being robotic and emotionless. I was afraid they jus wanted a hot chick for the sake of having a hot chick, but she's pretty decent. Thomas Dekker is also a good John Connor.<br /><br />The whole cast works fine and the show stays active and full of action.
B006RXQ62U|5.0|Great movie, great acting and amazing singing by the whole cast.<br /><br />I really felt like Cell Block Tango was the star of the show, but then again, I'm not the only one, so I'll just blend in with the crowd on that one
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book keeps you reading and up past your bedtime. If you liked the movie you will love the books
B001XV09UG|2.0|Didn't really care for the constant feelings of &#34;Huh?&#34; as I watched this. Seemed like a way of just showing a lot of nudity and profanity without any real reason for it. Most of the movie was too confusing and hard to follow for me to get into. Oh well, my 2 cents.<br /><br />Although I do feel that Kidman's performance at the end was very real, and possibly could have been her actually talking to Cruise, and not in character. She was believable and seeing as they split not long after this, I stand by my hypothesis.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Lot of action, a little romance and human side to the movie.
B001BANK32|5.0|Such a classic of the genre, and definitely a different experience from the movie. Though the setting of the mysterious and evil mountain hotel is spine-tingling, the true source of King's reputation as a great storyteller are his wonderful characters. Finely-drawn, complex, and flawed--it is who they are that drives the story. And the bastard makes you love them. Even Jack, doomed from the first pages, you keep hoping he'll find a way to hold onto his humanity and his desperate love for his family. That's the true horror of this novel: everyone starts out full of love and the determination to do right by their family, and it still might not be enough.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I'm so glad I was able to find the limited edition version that offered the original movie.  I hate that I cannot find the 97 special edition on DVD but the original is what made the 97 edition possible right? :)
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Enjoyed the different perspectives.  Very entertaining.  I did not want to put the book down.  I hope the movie is half as good.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love this movie.  It's a what a movie of it's type should be fun to watch.  I would recommend this movie as a must see.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|The story skipped around somewhat, so one had to pay close attention.  The writers made the future quite eventful in many ways.  Will look forward to more.
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|For being the third in the series it wasn't a complete disaster! It was well done, the dinosaurs were very abundant and the story line was good! Can't say I'm a big Tea Leoni fan but other than that it was very good.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's such a mind boggling game you have to really have an eye for anything out  of the ordinary. Overall I thought this game was really fun..
0307292096|5.0|this is a beautiful edition of Game of Thrones! i wish the whole series was available in this edition. wow
6303122876|5.0|My kids grew up with this movie  and they loved it. When I told my grown son I had found it online he almost begged for me to order it. We got to show it to a group a kids and they were glued trying to figure out all the puppets. The copy I got was in very, very, good shape and played well. Shipping was fine and it has seen about every 2 weeks by my landladies kids next door. Timeless story an must see for the whole family from 2yrs to 92.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is how one should enjoy home entertainment. Great box set! Includes DVDs Blu rays and Online. For price you cannot beat it. 5 stars
B0067TQQI8|1.0|WON'T KEEP A CONNECTION AFTER 2nd DAY OF USE!!!! The unit had been sitting on a table so it can't be anything I did to it. It charges for 5 seconds then a connection is lost
3836532441|4.0|I've been looking for a coffee table type book of pin up art; I'm glad I decided on this book. The illustrations are beautiful!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|The content of all 3 DVDs are very interesting to say the least.  However the audio content on the bonus DVD of the live 1977 Hotel California tour was recorded too hot when it was transferred to DVD.  Meaning some TVs, like my 42\\" Plasma Panasonic Viera set, could not handle it.  The audio came out very distorted at any volume level.  It was unlistenable.  I had to play the DVD through my audio system, bypassing the TV, for it to be listenable. Someone recorded the audio level too high (too hot) on the DVD (a real audio genius) so some TVs may not be able to handle it without putting some kind of audio attenuator between the DVD player and the TV set.  The other two DVDs, History of Part 1 and 2, are fine as far as the audio is concerned.  If you are a Eagles fan this live concert material from the past is just priceless. This is 5 star stuff!
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|The costumes and screenry are worth the watch.  And then one gets into the plot and we discover the genius of Jane Auston.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The book was an easy read. The story moving and was consistent. I enjoyed reading it and I am looking forward to the next one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This very customizable app is perfect. Whether your trying to sleep or justneed a couple of minutes to relax so you can continue your day.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I like playing this game on my tablet when I'm not in front of the computer playing the game on Facebook and using power-ups such as Birdquake and Wingman, and the games that Rovio comes up with every week (last week's &#34;Proposal game&#34; was fun, too, and a sweet and unique way to ask for a lady FB fan's hand in marriage ;)  Suggestions for future games?  Please include Stella the Pink Bird with her bubble powers!  She's my favorite of all the AB characters (Bomb and Matilda place second and third!), and I'd like to see her kicking Bad Piggy butt in the weekly ABF tournaments!
B000003CMD|5.0|Wait for the multi disc set coming out June 25, 2013<br /><br />* Remastered original<br />* Outtakes<br />* 1973 November Live Concert - Winterland Arena, San Francisco, CA
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This program works great from my Android and Kindle Fire HD.  I'm so impressed.  I can access everything on my computer while I'm away from home. It's like magic.  I've tried several other programs in the past and none of the worked.  Jump Desktop works like a charm and was easy to install and use.  I almost can't believe it.<br /><br />The only draw back is that you have to leave your computer on to be able to access it.  This is not a problem with my desktop computer but a laptop battery would run down and need to be recharged.  My husband doesn't think its safe to leave a laptop plugged in for long periods of time.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is very useful for anyone who wants to monitor weather conditions at home or for other locations. I use it daily to check local conditions. Also, if I plan to travel I use it to check the weather before I go and while I am there. I recommend it highly.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|Interesting story about a very dysfunctional family and what made them come together finally.  Also speaks to the addiction of alcohol and the effects it has on not only the individual but the family members as well.  Deadly.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I had heard great things about this movie, and I would say some of them were true. The plot was ultimately heart warming, and the acting was compelling. Even so, I can't say it was an enjoyable viewing experience. The dialogue for the first 2/3 consisted mostly of screeching arguments, and the scenes seemed to transition randomly (with little logic). To sum, watching this movie made me feel like I had an inner ear disorder.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well written book. Has good plot. It does get pretty steamy, but scenes are relevant and well incorporated into plot.
0399162097|5.0|I was sick on Mother's Day this year. So I stayed in bed... with this book. I read for 8 straight hours and had to make myself stop before my eyes exploded. I finished it the very next day. Now, I'm in book mourning. You know that feeling, when you finish an amazing novel and are certain no other book can ever be so good as the one you just closed the cover on? That's where I am.<br /><br />Fowler breaks all of the rules in this book. And she does so beautifully. It takes a true master of the craft to manipulate language and story as she has done. She manages to weave all sorts of scientific information into the narrative without me ever feeling I somehow landed in a text book.<br /><br />Rosemary is immediately likable. I could relate to her, despite growing up without a chimp-sister. Her need to hide who she is rings true for so many people. She didn't sugarcoat her brother, either. Lowell is painted as the loyal loving brother he was, but also clearly angry and unstable.<br /><br />Possibly my favorite aspect of this novel: Memory. Rose is honest about her memories and her uncertainty of their truth. The way her parents remember her childhood and the way she remembers it are world's apart, but both are correct.<br /><br />There are longer more in-depth reviews posted, and I am sure they did a beautiful job of dissecting and recommending this novel. I am still in a place of book euphoria. All I can really say is, this story is amazing. Order your copy right now.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I love it.  It is the absolute best way of reading a Holmes collection because no matter when i get time to read they are all there in one place so i don't have to go looking for one book or another
B005OYKI1I|4.0|Good to see most all characters back for this one.  The action scenes were a little far-fetched, but overall pretty exciting.  I liked it.
B009S33I68|5.0|I have seen many shows that tell of this time in the war in Vietnam, but reading this first hand account really gives you the REAL picture of what the hell went wrong! First hand accounts having the facts is irreplaceable. Many insights as to why decisions or lack of were made that cost men dearly. Mostly with their lives.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  The characters were very interesting, quirky, and unique.  I loved how it all came together and how the 2 characters fell in love in the end.  It's interesting how people can be brought together, and also how people can lose their minds due to a devastating experience.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Love all the casting, great pacing, very exciting, sometimes funny. The CGI for the Iron Man Suit is absolutely perfect.
B009R659L8|5.0|I always like Mary Higgins Clark. I like how the characters intertwine until it all comes together. Done in two days.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|My brother recommended this book to me! He typically is not much of a reader and has read this book several times. I figured it must be good! I am hardly a runner so thought i couldn't relate but from the first page I couldn't stop reading! I felt like the stories, science, and history were all woven together perfect to create wonderful and inspiring book! I have never wanted to become a runner so bad in my life! Truly a good read!
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I am a huge Reacher fan. This book doesn't disappoint. I will recommend this book to anyone that reads Lee Child.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use it as a means to listen to local Fire department activity when I don't have an RF source. Works great, especially with logging in, so it remembers my favorites.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Such a fun read. Great story, very well-written, and if you grew up in the 80's you'll absolutely love it.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Every time I watch the movie I'm reminded how much I need to buy this soundtrack. It's so epic and matches the tone of the film so well.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Quite the adventure, it explains the relationship between Loki and Thor leading into the Avengers film, so see this one before you watch Avengers.  We didn't catch it at the theater, so we saw it after the Avengers came out.  It's always a pleasure to watch Anthony Hopkins at work.  We are very excited to see Thor 2 coming out soon!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is the first book that I have read by Gillian Flynn but have subsequently bought her other two books. She is the master of the sick mind and twist in the tail, you can't believe that there could be people out there that are like the characters in her books.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Once I got past the awful first few Captain America uniforms, I felt better about where the show was going.  Very entertaining and a must see/own for Avengers fans.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|Saw the show on PBS and fell in love with the music and was pleasantly surprised how well done it was.  It's one of my top favorites that I listen to all the time.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The great thing about purchase is you can rewatch movie.  Saves you the gas $ and your time if you where to go rent a movie, easy, fast and convinient doing it thru Amazon.
0345529057|5.0|haven't read books, they were a gift for my son's birthday and he watches the series on tv and he enjoys them.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a first class show that really focuses on how unfair life can be whilst accepting that dwelling on that fact doesn't help. It's all about tenacity and pushing on, hoping for more wins than losses. I can't get enough of it.
0553801473|5.0|this was a purchase for my son's birthday.  He enjoys this genre and the series on tv. I have not read books.\
B00263HWM8|5.0|A GREAT STORY AND T C WAS HIS USUAL GREATNESS!!!  I LOVE ACTION MOVIES AND THIS ONE DELIVERED.  WAITING FOR NUMBER 3!!
B007SOQBCM|1.0|The games NEVER load all it says is twitch tv has stopped don't get it even though it's free it's not worth your time
1401323820|5.0|Excellent book from an excellent writer.the book was mostly hyped up by the tv series but it was a good read.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the first book of the trilogy with my book club. I saw the movie shortly after it came out. It is one of those few movies that I choose to add to my collection to be watched more than one time. I'll watch it again before the second movie comes out.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Well this book was like the best Percy Jackson book out of four now we all know Annabeth was in love with Luke
1400069807|5.0|This is an entertaining, but eye-opening book about the incremental dismantling of the American diet. It takes you behind the scenes to see how and why large food conglomerates and researchers make the decisions they make that affect all our lives. The book overall makes a case [to me] for trending toward more whole foods, unprocessed, or processed at home using my own canning and preserving methods. After reading this book, try opening \\"Nourishing Traditions\\" by Sally Fallon for even more assumption-busting nutrition advice.
