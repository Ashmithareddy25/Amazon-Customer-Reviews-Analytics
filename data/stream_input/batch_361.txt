0385504209|1.0|The DaVinci Code is a terribly written book. Halfway through, I started turning down the corners of pages with egregious errors of style or usage; I probably turned down a dozen pages, and if I'd been wiser, I would have turned down the entire book in the first place. The characters have the depth of puddles. The plot unfolds in real time, which is for the best, since I strongly doubt the author could have handled anything more complex.<br />The protagonists break the DaVinci code by figuring out a series of puzzles. Several of the puzzles are unbelievable, and one is painfully obvious. (&quot;It's like no language I've ever seen before!&quot;)<br />What is of interest in the DaVinci Code is not due to the author. He draws on a changing view of Mary Magdelene, as not a prostitute but someone equal to the other apostles, and perhaps even the wife of Christ. He imagines that some of the hidden symbolism that does in fact exist in Leonardo's Last Supper and in his other works refers to Magdelene's true identity. The historical material is fascinating, reminding us that history is indeed written by the winner. It's only too bad that a better writer didn't elect to make use of this compelling historical information.
B0000TB03W|4.0|I cannot get enough of &quot;UP.&quot; It is pure fun and enjoy to see Shania entertain thousands of fans alike. I love her energy and great talent and unbelieveable voice. This dvd is a must-have for any fan. I recommend it!
B0000C7PSW|4.0|I'm a long time Rufus Wainwright fan but I just don't think this CD is as overwhelmingly beautiful as Poses. It's about as good as his first album and maybe a little better. As several reviewers have already said, the first two songs are the best. There are several other very nice tracks too, but the album kind of drags at some points. I don't think there are any bad songs here but Want One doesn't have the variety, clarity, or musical splendor of Poses. Still, I don't demand that any artist put out the same sort of material all the time. This CD is well worth buying. <br />One last note: the song &quot;Want&quot; has some interesting lyrics, and one thing Rufus says is that he just wants to be his dad. If the son of a certain person mentioned in this song ever said something like this in a song, he'd never hear the end of it from the critics!
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania is truly a star when it comes to great performances. She sings live and never misses a beat. I love this dvd and I want everyone to see it. Ask for it for your Christmas present. It is well worth it!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD after attending Shania's impressive Cleveland concert in October. High-energy performances from both her and her team of highly skilled professionals. Her vocals, awesome guitarists, explosive drummer and percussionist really deliver. And not to mention the rest of the band, along with the now-signature Triple Fiddles! Many of the slightly altered arrangements actually sound better than the music-only CD versions. Crank \\"UP!\\" your home entertainment system and have a \\"Shania Party!\\"
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania is certainly a country sensation. She has a great voice and personality. She loves country music, but tries new sounds. I admire her so much for being so bold and so strong for enduring all the critics. This dvd is another showcase of her love for country music and her FANS!!! You have to get this dvd.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|This combination live CD/DVD is taken from Coldplay's performance in Sydney, Australia on their 2003 world tour. Having attended Coldplay's concert in Austin, Texas on the same tour my opinion is that this package perfectly captures their live performance. I give both the CD and the DVD a rating of five stars because of the combination, the price, and the quality.<br />Instead of screwing the consumer and giving everyone yet another reason to download rather than purchase, someone in charge made the intelligent decision to package the CD and DVD together. Additionally, the packaged material is doubled, while the price is not. Smart.<br />The quality of both the performance and the production value are the real stars here. Personally, I don't like to see live releases from bands until after at least three to four studio albums to their credit; it usually makes for a more balanced concert experience. However, even with their growing record career, this recording presents a solid set list.<br />The CD works as a kind of live collection of Coldplay's greatest hits to date, taken from their rare first EP, &quot;Parachutes,&quot; and &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head,&quot; with a B-side and new song thrown in for good measure. Overall, the audio CD is a great recording and a great selection of tracks; shinning stars are &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; &quot;One I Love,&quot; and the great big sing-along &quot;Everything's Not Lost.&quot;<br />The DVD is awesome! I have seen far too many live concerts that fall short of capturing a band's live performance. Additionally, there have also been an onslaught of bad &quot;free&quot; DVDs that have recently come packaged with new CDs, which are simply a weak ploy to try and combat rampant internet piracy. In sharp contrast, &quot;Coldplay Live 2003&quot; presents the band perfectly. Taken from the same Sydney performance from July of 2003, it shows the band in top form, featuring the entire concert, whereas the CD runs out of available space. Special features include lyrics (which the CD booklets do not), simultaneous multiple angles on fours tracks (taken from the stage show's giant screens), and a 40-minute documentary, featuring footage from Italy, a hometown gig in London, at The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, and at Red Rocks in Colorado. Overall, knowing that the 90 minute concert was shot on sixteen 16mm cameras in near-dark exposure conditions, edited in only four months, and features a very decent documentary detailing live concerts and backstage footage, &quot;Coldplay LIve 2003&quot; is a good accomplishment. The focus of the DVD, performance and documentary, remains on the band which is a great creative decision and the most entertaining for the fans.<br />The most important thing for me as a fan, whether live in person at a concert or watching live footage of the band, is that they perform just as well live as in studio, if not better. Coldplay did that in Austin and they do that here from Sydney. Additionally, the members of Coldplay seem to be good people: as seen from their on-stage performance (wanting to offer their best musically and include everyone in the audience) as well as in the documentary when they did not complain about a late night concert and an early, next morning radio show performance.<br />Overall, a solid concert, a great concert film, and worht watching or listening to again and again.
B0000TB03W|4.0|&quot;Forever and Always&quot; shows the audience love and &quot;Up&quot; shows you the joy of living. You need to see the DVD not just the T.V. show to see and capture the complete Shania in this life of music.
B000003TA4|4.0|i am getting tired of pearl jam fans trashing this album, and nirvana fans trashing pearl jam fans and glorifying this album.  Come on folks.....<BR>   i read in rolling stone the other week that this album was rated in the top ten of the top 500 albums of all time.  That just makes me see how this album can be overrated, as far as musical greatness and diversity goes.  Don't get me wrong, i still like the album.  It has a good sound and i think this album allowed for bands like alice in chains, pearl jam,  and soundgarden to let their sounds hit mainstream.  i just found it strange how bands like soungarden had already been around for a while, doing their amazing music, and all the sudden they are recognized when this album comes out. <BR>   i can see how this album may be held up high because of its ability to bring other music out, but when you break down the album, the music isnt anything god-like.  Good songs, but after listening to the meat puppets and the pixies, you can definitely hear where Kurt got his influences from. I personally think that In Utero was the best Nirvana album because some of the material in it was more mature sounding and a little more diverse.  I think it would have been interesting if Kurt could have straightened out and made more music, hopefully something a little more musically diverse than Nevermind.   <BR>What caused this album popularity and the emergence of grunge was nirvana's willingness to become mainstream.  Other bands came out too, but i don't think it was Nirvana's music that everyone was following as many say, especially those who hold the album up so high.  You look at other grunge bands and their music is quite different and unique.  So pearl jam fans:  see how this album had some good music, but more importantly helped bust grunge out of its cage.  Nirvana fans: nirvana was great, but hey had a weakness that caused the band to collapse, and you can see it in the music.  Pearl jam is the only band to survive that era and are still putting out good music. (check out Lost Dogs, unique releases)
B0000TB03W|4.0|I'm in love with this amazing DVD. Shania rocks this concert like she's never done before. She comes back big and makes a splash on the scene. She sings with her heart and soul in each song. Each song has a special meaning to her and she takes pride in their message. I love this DVD.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania were do you go next? This is a great DVD with great music and energy. I have followed Shanias music and each time she gets better and better. Each time she gets in front of the fans she seems to gain more energy. What is the limit of her ability and talent? I think she has a long way and a long time to go before she hits her very total best but this DVD is a major key to the hights she can reach. It is great.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania's first concert here in the U.S. in over 2 years and wow did she deliver one great show! You get to see the excitement of appoximately 50,000 people. The dynamic performance of Shania Twain will leave you breathless. There are 22 amazing songs. Each one will have you singing along. Shania has intertwined her classic hits beautifully with her new sure to become classic songs in this cooncert.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twains fans are of every age, sex, racial, ethnic, soical and economic background. She has struck a cord with all that have heard her music. She fought the Country establishment because of her dress and won. Now folks are after the crossover issue. This DVD shows that Shania is a great and talented person. It does not matter what area you want to put her music she sings what she feels what she wants. She preforms to upmost of her ability and that is a lot more than most and more than a lot of the so called stars of today. She shows this again in this DVD. Shania is a great singer that touches most everyone who hears her. Do not sweat the crossover issue just listen and watch a great talent on this DVD.
B0000TB03W|4.0|She gets hot and hotter each time around. This time, she showcases her live performance in this great, amazing dvd. This is a must-have, so get your copy now!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is up and moving in this great new DVD that covers so much of her music career. These songs where great when recorded but the added energy of the fans or the energy from the come back push all of the nusic up and over the top. This is Shanias best work. I cannot wait to receive it and be able to view it again. I have seen it more than once and each time I see it I feel better about it being the best of Shania.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania just recently hit #1 on GAC! This dvd proves to you that she well deserves this title. Her powerhouse performance is unbelieveable. She brings to live her hit songs. This dvd is great and you gotta get it. Catch it good.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I would love to Shania come to the smaller towns and medium size towns to give a show. Where I live I need to travel to CA or L.V. to see her. I would love to be able to see a show like Up Live in Chicago. The music, band, energy, fans and everything made this a great DVD. Shania can do whatever she puts her mind to and this DVD proves that. She can make great music, leave, come back and make great music. She is just an all around great talent.
B0000TB03W|4.0|There is so much more depth to her singing this time around. There was a new found joy of being in front of the people she loves to entertain. Make people move with her music. Shania has found a new level one that most singers never reach. Shania has climbed and reached totally new heights with her music. Shania has proven again and again she is a true super star before but now no one can disagree that she is the new Queen of country music. Shania's songs can only inspire everyone who hears them. Live in Chicago is a mile stone.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's DVD Up Live in Chicago is the best work I have seen by her yet. The only knock if there is one is that she could get a little better at dancing. She packs the DVD full of her music that is fun serious loving and full of great talent. Shania has out sold all the female country singers and most of the male sings. She sings the songs she wants and gives the fans her best.
B0000797IO|1.0|I can't believe how dissapointing this movie was for me! I love Jennifer Anniston and while she did a great job acting in the movie, I was really let down. This movie had the worst storyline I have ever come across! I truly have no clue as to how this movie got into theatres. Sure it had a few comical parts (especially the lady who gave make-overs, plus a pretty good cast). But I could've wrote this movie myself, I guessed what would happen within the first 20 minutes of this ridiculous time wasting movie, almost in a jokingly way and everything I predicted was right. I learned that just because you like the actors in a movie, doesn't always guarantee greatness.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Just beautiful. This soundtrack has really brought the trilogy of the lord of the rings to a memorable close. It wasn't the resounding bombastic finale I expected, which makes me anxious as to what that could mean concerning the story: Do the good guys win or not? If they do, why is the ending so bittersweet? It feels as if a great price has been paid to overcome the dark, monumental odds. <br />I heard news about the director of the film [Peter Jackson] intending to strike audiences at the heart with this last installment of the trilogy. If that is the intention, I would have to say this score certainly engrosses its listener with a stirring sense of maturity and a powerful emotional rush. <br />Whatever the motivation behind this work Howard Shore's effort here is beautiful. From the captivating, stirring bittersweet/ominous themes of the soundtrack's opening cue ['A Storm is Coming'], to the gorgeous flute melodies in 'The Steward of Gondor' [featuring Sir James Galway, and a really nice performance by Billy Boyd], to the emotional highs of 'Twilight and Shadow' [Renee Fleming sounds like an angel, but somehow, it's Shore's expansion of the 'Evenstar' cue in the Two Towers that really makes this track the gorgeous peace of music that it is].... <br />I could go on and on. There are newer themes like 'Minas Tirith' and 'the Black Gate Opens' that could easily be performed with even more spectacular grandeur - a la the Return of the King 'Trailer Theme'[notwithstanding 'the White Tree' is a real highlight of energy in the soundtrack for me - the violins swirl with great vigor as the track ends], and wonderful twists of the darker themes, like Minas Morgul, Cirith Ungol, and Ash and Smoke. Shelobs lair is brilliant composition. No one can contest the sheer uneasiness and dynamic quality it exudes. I cannot wait to see 'She' in action in the film. <br />The Rivendell theme ['Many Meetings' from the Fellowship of the Ring], which was given a beautiful, heartbreaking turn in the Two Towers soundtrack ['the Leave Taking'], is reestablished in a majestic way in 'Anduril', hinting strongly at the King's Return. Speaking of majesty, the End of All Things is another real highlight on the soundtrack. It feels as if all choirs and leitmotifs of a dark or dramatic nature have come together to witness what must surely be the climax of the entire story. <br />I've rambled for too long. But I did want to mention the last three tracks on this album. 'The Return of the King', 'the Grey Havens', and Annie Lennox's 'Into the West'. I think the real heart of the entire journey has been captured in these final cues and songs. I felt genuinely sad, realising that the story was over, and that this was goodbye. Bittersweet, yet utterly classic. <br />Please listen to all three albums of the Lord of the Rings. Howard Shore has achieved something monumental with this story, he has inspired and awed us with majestic scores, and yet touched our hearts with heart itself.
0446310786|5.0|A few novels moved me thus. Narrated by a child, the book moves in a slow, but sure pace through the life and times of 1930s Alabama town, the treacheries and hypocrisies of grown up world becoming evident to a child. The narrative &quot;kills you softly&quot;, till tears sparkle in your eyes, for the novel is written in a very meaningful style, in a way where events, ideas and words touch your heart, stir you into thinking, and on the surface the author seems to be going around telling a very simple story, and that too in plain English, straightforward sentences.<br />Recommended reading for everyone!
B00005JM0B|5.0|This movie really beat the odds. It had the obvious handicap that digital, liquid metal, effects are no longer as surprising/exciting as they were in 1991, when T2 came out. Still, from a technological point of view, you can appreciate quiet a lot of progress between the two films, specially during the public bathroom fight (wow !!!!). The movie comes to show not just anybody with a computer can make CGI effects these days(see Charlie's Angels, The Hulk, etc.).<BR>I'm glad the film stuck to the T1 &amp; T2 mold, I don't think it would have been very exciting to see the Terminators fighting in Alaska, negotiating a peace truce or whatever. The formula still works even though it's hard to expect it to be as fresh a in the first two films. Like a James Bond film, there are some things you just expect to see.<BR>The movie looks and sounds great on DVD and is sure to give your equipment a run for its money. The extra features could have been a little better though. There is some behind the camera footage on the film stunts but it hardly covers all we would like to see (what about the cemetery scenes ? the hearse going under the truck ? the mentioned public bathroom fight ?). The Indiana Jones DVD documentaries seemed to be a lot more thorough even though they are so much older.<BR>Still, there is not much to complain. I seriously doubt a fourth movie about a post-apocalyptic world with John Connor in charge will be as appealling as the the first three ones with Terminators-out-of-their-own-time theme, specially with Governor Arnold out of the picture, anyway, who knows ?!?
B00006JJ1O|2.0|I think it just highlights the state of the music industry nowadays when record companies have to go as far as russia to reel in the money. Although i think it was a really well executed plan to bring two very controversial, easily manipulated youngsters to our ears. Musically the album is pretty good and the songs show some degree of emotion, i think the vocals are grating at times but that's all down to taste. &quot;How soon is now?&quot; is a very tame effort, which was a  song written by &quot;The Smiths&quot; in the 80s. The record company wanted to produce easily digestable pop and it succeded. You'll love the songs just long enough to go out and buy the album which will be forgotten in a couple weeks of listening. If you think you've created a special emotional bond with the fore metioned artists think again, they don't even understand what their singing (They Don't speak English) Vocals are dull and unemotional. :)
0676973779|4.0|What can I say?  When I recieved Life of Pi as a gift I was less than thrilled.  As a person who is not what many would call 'spiritual' the last book I intended to read was one that 'would make me believe in God', as one of the reviewers put it.  Regardless of this statement I made it my mission to read this book and see if it could change my outlook on religion.<BR>I started reading the book soon after I was given it and continued to pick it up every now and then when I had nothing else to read.  At first the novel just couldn't hold my attention, I would read a chapter or so and put it down.  I don't know at what part of the book my interest changed, but it did. Soon I was enthralled by it, I couldn't put it down.  I started to think about what I would do if I were in the same situation.  So what is the point of this review that I have written?  It is to let you know that if you begin reading this book then you MUST finish it.  The biggest payoff comes in the last chapter.  Somehow I suspected the ending all along, but still I gaped at it's honesty.  Life of Pi didn't change my view of religion but it did help me understand what others gain from spirituality.  It illustrated the strength of the human spirit under dire circumstances, and the inner animal instincts we possess.  Think of Life of Pi as a fantasy that is rooted in reality.

B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina Aguilera truly shows her amazing vocal talent in this wonderful Christmas album. In almost every song, she builds up slowly to the climax of the song where she beautifully belts out the high notes. This is THE Christmas album. Every song is wonderful and I can guarantee you won't skip over any of them. After listening to this album over and over again, you will find yourself listening to other versions of Christmas songs and finding them not as good as Christina's versions. You will not regret buying this!
B000002HHB|3.0|Good songs:<br />  Wonder, Beloved Wife, River, Carnival, Jealousy, Where I Go<br />General impression:<br />  All songs are not bad but none are excellent. Some arrangements are nice but the record sounds dragging and merely boring.<br />Rating:  **1/2<br />Conclusion:  not recommended
B00008PW2E|5.0|WHAT can I add that everyone hasn't already said????  RELEASE THE SECOND SEASON before people move on to the next hot show and you lose out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>There is no reason for you to not release it to us.... the fans....
B0000CDLA7|5.0|It's awesome to hear a band that has so much diversity in their music.  There are not very many bands that can play so many types of music and still sound great.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  Dream Theater ROCKS!!!!!!!!
B00000DHR0|1.0|I purchase three christmas album this year, and celine was include in the package. Why I purchased it I dont know...Okay I thought with Celine's great voice she could nail some Christmas song. Well she Nail them, but not one single note she hit moved me in any shape or form. It's as though she's a robot with no feeling, no heart. Saddly to say I will not be playing &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; for Christmas. I took her right back to the store for a refund along with another christmas song. Celine please try to feel the music, and sing from your heart and not pretend to feel it. These are the special times wouldnt recommend, I would recommend you keep walking passed it or get bored to sleep.
B00005LOUP|2.0|The problem with this movie is that it's one hour too long.  This movie could have worked if they would have just stuck to the original premise of the story and done away with the other characters.  I didn't care about any of the supporting characters except for the originals that were in the book.  Jim Carrey does a wonderful acting job as the hated Grinch.  But not even he can save this movie.  Kids may love it, but I didn't care for it.  Stick with the book!!
B000002A46|1.0|I bought this album, and I don't like it. I took it back to the store, and got me a refund. The album is compeletely boring. Never again will I ever buy another Mariah Carey Cd! Fool me once, but not again!
B000002NHN|5.0|Wow! Blown away by this recording, a technological masterpiece, in that the music presented sounds like it is being performed (mind you a virtuoso performance) on simple ancient Celtic instruments. In fact a couple of the tracks sound very Middle Eastern inspired or Indian in origin; such as the &quot;Prologue,&quot; and &quot;Marco Polo.&quot; Yet some of my favorite tracks, &quot;The Mummers' Dance,&quot; sound very Celtic in their rhythm and vocalizations. This song was originally inspired by a Mummers' troupe who went aboard a stranded ship in Newfoundland to entertain the crew. This song has it's roots in ancient Celtic rites of Spring coinciding with traditional folk celebrations of May Day in Southern England. The track, &quot;Skellig,&quot; for instance, although written in Tuscanny, was inspired by the Irish monks who were credited with the &quot;saving of civilization,&quot; in the Dark Ages. Sequestered on the Skellig Islands off the coast of western Ireland these monks kept alive some of the finast examples of sacred literature while making real world comments in the margins of many of these texts. &quot;The Highwayman&quot; is a piece bourne out of Elizabethan legend and one fully expects to have that happy Hollywood ending if following along with the lyrics. Be prepared for several twists and turns! Many more intriguing liner notes explain the songs and lyrical development further. My favorite piece on the recording is, &quot;Dante's Prayer,&quot; almost an ancient Celtic lamentation which features lyrics that cry out to an unseen force/lover, to please, &quot;Remember me.&quot; What makes this recording so incredible is that Loreena McKennitt has composed all the music and written 98% of all the lyrics! From a different time and age, a view to a rich tapestry of imagery! This is a must have recording for fans of Celtic inspired and World music genre's.
0783225733|5.0|A longer albeit appropriate alternate title for Apollo 13. Like the rest of my family, I (then in my teens) sat on tenterhooks before our TV, praying for our Astronauts.  Though no one must believe in an Almighty God / Buddha / Mohammed / What Have You, Apollo 13 is superb evidence that such a Divinity not only Exists but has a Good Reason for Everything - and contemplating the 100s of literal Miracles by which our Astronauts safely returned to Earth, it is at least clear to me, one or more Angels / Unseen Helpers were there, helping our Men surmount the otherwise Impossible.  No, no one -has to- believe in God.  The Bottom Line here is whether it's Apollo 13 -or- any of the countless unexplainable times when one or more human beings could have 'bought' it but didn't, Something - or Someone - surely intervened ... furnishing, I say, ample reason to throw \\"God is dead / doesn't exist\\" OUT the door.  Watch Apollo 13 and draw your own conclusion - and I wish for you that you reach the sort of conclusion I briefly expounded upon here.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire is a decent film with great special effects. The movie's best scenes center around the dragon hunters and their efforts to bring down the big flying beasts.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|get it !!!!!! it is a must buy.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|I saw this one on a dare from a friend, not expecting much since the first one was so goofy and boring.<br />There are still some major continuity problems; no Angel or Beast, Iceman and Pyro are kids; but at least Anna Paquin does'nt get so much on-screen whining time. Plus the fight scenes are MUCH better and Storm isn't so wimpy with the use of her powers. <br />The film features my favorite X-Man: Nightcrawler. His powers were displayed quite well in the movie, the art direction in general is very good. Plus the DVD is filled with a bunch of Nightcrawler based extras.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I really think that Dream Theater is a band with no boarders. They don't have to give excuses to no one. It's a new sound for Dream Theater and that's okay. I miss the old sound. But the new album is good too. And is NOT NU-METAL. And for the other review... TOOL IS NOT NU-METAL. TOOL IS BEYOND NU-METAL. And don't compare it with Linkin Park or other band like that. ...
0446530891|5.0|This is only the second book I have read by Baldacci and I must say from the very first page to the end of the book I could not put it down. I finished it in one day and have recommended this book to a number of people who really want a book that grabs you from the beginning to the end. I found it to be one of the most exciting books I have read so far this year.
B000089RVR|5.0|I was a little dissapointed when I heard the cd the first time through. I thought it was slow and it dragged on. I gave it another chance and then I was hooked. The songs I enjoy are White Flag, Life for rent and This Land is Mine<BR>They are definitely the most catchy and sweet pieces. Also an honorable mention &quot;who makes you feel&quot; it has a seductive appeal. Give it a chance and it will grow on you!!
0385504209|5.0|This book was recommended when it first appeared on the market and is a must read. Truly keeps your interest.
B000002INJ|5.0|I was in 8th grade the first time I heard this record.<br />Awsome POWER and fast heavy metal guitars with thundering drums and lead vocals that can simply shatter glass. The RAW power of thier music touched a very primal male element in my mind. I began to sing along as if I were a member of an anciet war-like tribe of men against the world which I tryed so hard to fit in with. Ooops, anyway...<br />If you need a boost of self confidence, these guys sure are full of themselves. It can only make you feel stronger if faced with self doubt... Some lyrics are not for everyone, though. I usually fast forward \\"Pleasure Slave\\" if I'm with my wife. \\"Hail and Kill\\" is AWSOME. \\"The Crown and the Ring\\" kinda draggs but it kinda tells/sings a story. \\"Kings of Metal\\" is long but VERY good. \\"Kingdom Come\\" is such a confidence boost... \\"Heart of Steel\\" is a great ballad. And wait till your ears listen to \\"The Sting of the Bumblebee\\" instrumental. It is lighning FAST!<br />As their music progresses you can hear many elements that really \\"clicked\\" born from this record. The Kings of Metal...
B0000E1WNV|5.0|This DVD is absolutely amazing. The show is terrific, and only an idiot could say that &quot;I would have opted for a show played in front of an English speaking audience&quot;. It is well known for everyone that the Italian and Spanish fans are among the best around the world, even better than an American crowd (needless to say than the English). So what? Isn't music language universal? I remember when Bruce opened his World Tour after the Tracks box set. It was April 9th, 1999 in Barcelona. Chance? No way. And there were people from all over the world in Palau Sant Jordi. CNN TV channel was there. I was there too!<br />The first time Bruce releases a complete show, and the one in Barcelona is a very good choice. Remember it was already on MTV European TV. Where are you going to find Bruce alone playing &quot;Spirits in the Night&quot; on the piano, and guessing the lyrics, eh? And where would you find Bruce giving an extra bis after &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot;? And this is &quot;Thunder Road&quot;!!!<br />And have you seen his face, always giving everything (crying, smiling, laughing!)?<br />Don't waste your time reading this and just buy the DVD right away!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I now own all three soundtracks for the films. The Fellowship has been my all-time favorite CD until today, and now I must say for the first time it has a challenger--it's own sibling soundtrack, the Return of the King! Howard Shore has really outdone himself this time--this is an AMAZING soundtrack. It even features Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen in tracks 5 and 17, respectively, as well as a little return of &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; everyone loved so much from The Fellowship (track 17)! My favorite by far is #17, The Return of the King. Just listening to the soundtrack and anticipating the movie is enough to show anyone the film itself has the potential to bring about a wide range of audience emotion, not to mention its overall greatness! And as for the swan song, I had reservations about it at first. But &quot;Into the West&quot;, sung by Annie Lennox, is just beautiful...<br />An utterly amazing CD...and now we all know the movie will be 100x as wonderful as any dream!!! I recommend this to anyone and everyone! Happy listening!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|When I was 21, I was 30 pounds lighter, and I had boundless energy. At 41, I have mellowed, and grown in many ways. Such is the case with Whitney.  The comparisons to her youth are ridiculous.  Is anyone the same as they were 20 years ago?  Let's be real.<br />This is a beautiful album, and Whitney has a beautiful voice.  Her singing is more mature, and frankly has much more style.  I was never of fan of the young Whitney,but I love her now!
B00007E8O5|5.0|This is what grunge is all about. Magnificent work, go and buy it, you won't regret it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had previously only heard one song from Gavin, and then I went to a concert that he was the opening act for. I ended up liking him more than the band I went to see! He really knows how to work a crowd and is an amazing singer. I bought his cd right after his set and got him to autograph it for me! I have not been able to get his songs out of my head, and I listen to my cd non-stop! This is a must have cd for ANYONE!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Rock this concert. Just pure pleasure. I love it. I cannot get enough of it. Each song is great. Each performance is amazing. This dvd is a must-have. You will not regret it!
B00006RINF|5.0|what the hell?  according to amazon, &quot;people who bought&quot; lacuna coil &quot;also bought&quot; evanescence and &quot;also bought&quot; opeth?  my question...<br />who the F__K is sitting in their car and rotating opeth out of the cd player to groove on a little evanescence?  does that make sense to someone else out there?  that's like... people who bought &quot;formulas fatal to the flesh&quot; also listen to britney's latest stroke of musical genius, on the way to check out the new j-lo flick.  hmm...<br />sometimes, there just aren't enough guns.<br />i'm gonna join in on the assault against the &quot;evanescence spin-off guy&quot;...  hey, you!  go listen to your hip hop, home skillet.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd deserves all the praise. Shania rocks this concert with her heart and soul. She loves her audience and her audience adores her. I cannot get enough of &quot;Up.&quot; Watching and listening to it just makes me so happy. Get this dvd now!
B0000039PW|5.0|This is the G.O.A.T. rap album. Flawless beats, Biggie ripping every track, lyrically 100% on point and the best flow ever! I can't understand why some 2Pac d*ckriders rate this album only 1 star. Maybe did they realize that RTD is better than every Pac album i don't know. <BR>Go and cop it if you don't own this perfect masterpiece! <br />R.I.P<BR>The Notorious B.I.G.<BR>1972-1997<br />The only G.O.A.T.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is one of the best dvds of this year. You have to get this for yourself, family, and friends for Christmas. Each song is great and Shania looks stunning. I love how she gets the crowd going and singing along with her. This is one of the best concerts that I have seen!
B00005AQE8|2.0|Personally, I don't think it's a 5mics classic album. But it has a lot of good tracks, good collaboz and more. But 25% are filler tracks like the weak &quot;What'z Ya Phone #&quot;. I gave it 4 stars because it's a solid CD.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you saw Shania's tv Chicago special this dvd will provide you with the entire concert. It features 6 songs that did not air on tv. If you have never seen Shania perform this concert will open your eyes to how much charisma and stage presents she has. Shania seems more comfortable on stage then any performer i've ever seen. After seeing &quot;When You Kiss Me.&quot; sung live the song is distinctly romantic and will definitely be a huge success. The most adorable part is when Shania brings 3 little girls on stage to introduce &quot;I'm Gonna Getcha Good.&quot; Shania doesn't only enjoy singing on stage it very clear she also enjoys the camaraderie that she has with her band. The audience also seems to provide Shania with an energy that appears to be endless. Shania is a better entertainer then most. Shania knows what her fans want and she delivers it to them!
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis has become one of my favorite bands of all time.  I remember hearing &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; and &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot; on the radio back in the mid 90's, but it wasn't until recently that I actually started listening to &quot;(What's the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;  A friend played &quot;Wonderwall&quot; for me and I instantly fell in love with the song... (Don't ask how I managed NOT to hear this song when it was first released...)  <BR>Don't buy this cd and just listen to the well-known tracks, though.. Listen to the entire thing, because the entire cd is amazing.  I'd say this is their best album, but Oasis is good no matter what they do.  Sure, Liam and Noel are a bit arrogant, (yes, sarcasm implied here..) but that's why we love them, right?  The songs are brilliant, both melodically and lyrically.  They just manage to strike some hidden emotion inside you that makes you fall in love with the music.  My experience with Oasis' music is that they will be great no matter how long they're around...they never get boring... I could listen to their music forever.  Get this CD if you don't own it already!!!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the greatest Shania DVD! I wanted to see what she had done for her Special from Chicago: I was amazed! The pure energy you experience by watching the DVD is without limits! It's like being there with all those thousands of fans in Chicago: Shania is fantastic! The songs, the sultry voice the fireworks! Buy this DVD and throw a party have the time of your life!
B00006RU5B|1.0|Are you freakin' jokin me. This is not music, the singer sounds like he is singing from underwater and is in much stress because he is constipated. And what the heck is that golden flame on their cover, fire is obviously not gold. Fire is orange with blue at the bottom. Bonfires are pretty fun. We like to go to the beach and get the best fire pit. My Friend Buford has a pet dragon also and his dragon likes to blow fire. It is quite an extravagant vibrant expression of flame. Have you ever heard the sweet soothing voice of ronnie james dio, he sings rainbow in the dark and I am sure he has probably been to a bonfire or two. Cavemen invented fire and they would have been a lot happier at their bonfires if ronnie james dio sang rainbow in the dark by the fire. I highly dislike trolls, they are very mischevious and they steal your golf discs when you have a not so epic toss into the ancient forest of unicorns. Bob Dylan likes to fly into his concert on a unicorn, for a unicorn is a trusty steed. Bob Dylan has a harmonica, I bet Bob Dylan plays harmonica for his friends at bonfires. Audioslave is on of those bands that you listen to and think, I wonder what would happen if I wasn't listening to this cd. Then you realize it and you turn it off and put on the final countdown. I wonder if the band Europe had ever attended a bonfire. Ah the things I ponder. Oftentimes at traditional hawaiian luaus there are tiki men surrounding the bonfire, but the tiki men are made of coconut so they can't put them to close to the fire or then they will have multiple bonfires. I got really angry when mufasa died in the lion king, I think that mufasa should hvae grown wings while falling and flew away to his trusty blacksmith so that he would make a claymore for him to get revenge against scar. I just got back from the beach, I did some flips down the dunes but it really wasn't that fun, I think that if there was a bonfire then it would have been much more fun. If I was at a bonfire where ronnie james dio sang rainbow in the dark, bob dylan was playing harmonica, mufasa was chopping wood with his claymore, buford was riding his dragonm there was tiki men all around the fire and I had a box of krispy kremes and a vanilla coke, i would surely be able to die a happy man. The only thing that could make that bonfire better would be if Billy Idol was dancing with himself.I like gummi bears.....
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is truly an awesome performance by music's top female performer! And to top it off an outdoors concert in Chicago!! Shania had that park so jammed full of people there was no room for anyone else.Her vocals on this DVD are just amazing, and that's very difficult to do LIVE,but she breezes on through song after song singing her best! Her interaction with the crowd is just amazing as well.Shania keep it UP girl!! You are truly an amazing singer songwriter!! This DVD is a must buy for someone you know who loves music!!
0385335482|1.0|By now, everyone knows what the plot of the book is, therefore I will refrain from recounting the ever so intriguing and not all predictable storyline. Instead, I want to say that I was so appalled by this book that it physically hurt me to read it. Kinsella's style is pitiful. Her efforts at trying to be the next Helen Fielding fails ever so miserably. Rebecca, the main character in this book, does not come off as a witty, smart person to be pitied, as Fielding's Bridget Jones was. A tragic waste of paper.  Please, if you are in any way an intelligent and sensible person, spare yourself the physical torture I went through and go buy yourself a copy of Austen or Tolstoy.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Live in Chicago is a great dvd. I have watched this dvd many times and I still love it. There are many songs that Shania sings that I love. She is so down-to-earth and lovely. She puts in a lot of emotion into her singing and song-writing. The encore is one of the best of hers that I have seen!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JM02|4.0|Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than \\"Finding Nemo\\"?  We doubt it.  With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.<br />Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, \\"Aladdin,\\" \\"Shrek\\" or \\"Toy Story 2,\\" it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing.  I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged \\"kiddie\\" fare in recent years.  This is a film one can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so.  Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).<br />Like many tales designed for the junior set (\\"Dumbo,\\" \\"Bambi\\" etc.), \\"Finding Nemo\\" taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children.  It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film.  In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke.  Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.<br />Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.  Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.<br />As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, \\"Finding Nemo\\" takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is.kind of a fish his dad really is.<br />Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.

1558908382|4.0|Almost all movies that Cusack has done after &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; and &quot;Say Anything&quot; have him trying to be uber-cool, but seldom managing to really pull that off. A fact that is not really helped a lot when he pulls in the crook-lipped Joan Cusack into the movie as well.<br />With one exception: Grosse Point Blank.<br />The theme here (a hit man with a burgeoning conscience decides to go to his 10-year high school reunion but has to deal with a hit man union out to get him at the same time) sounded promising, and as with most Cusack movies has a great soundtrack plus some pretty interesting lines. You may and probably will have a very hard time believing that Cusack is a hit man.<br />It is a black comedy, hence pretty violent, and they weren't kidding about the &quot;grosse&quot;. The ending is particularly unsettling, with Cusack and his snappy patter blowing away the bad guys.<br />But that's not to say that there aren't good points. Dan Aykroyd is interesting, Alan Arkin is always welcome, and Minnie Driver pitches in some of the movie's high points of humor. The saving grace really has to be the music if you care about 80s tunes.<br />A decent watchable movie, perhaps even comical in some predicaments, but not something I'd be seen raving about.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I only liked one song on this cd and that was #3 Whenever, Wherever. A lot of the songs are in Spanish and I didn't like the other songs that she sang in English. Just buy the single for Whenever, Wherever. I found an import at Amazon.com its ASIN is B00005V8Z1 so just copy and paste it on the search box and it'll bring up the single. I gave it only one star because I only liked one song, if this was her English debut then it could have been much better.
B00005JM02|5.0|Ironically, I saw this movie with my 9 year old son, and I must have to say that despite the maker's comedic intent, I was moved to tears a number of times during the movie. <br />Finding Nemo is a wonderfully funny and emotional tale of one father's quest to find his lost son. In the process, the father learns a few things about being overprotective, being more of a father than a \\"nervous-nellie\\" to his son, and he comes to appreciate the special togetherness that only a son can bring. <br />A wonderful story for the entire family.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This movie is everything that a summer flick should be. Lots of action scenes and special effects. That's all I cared about and the movie is great if you like lots of action. The philosophy is not as good as it was in the first movie. It seems as if the movie was rushed and put out there to become a blockbuster hit. It was a little odd when regular people worshipped Neo as if he were god. <br />The movie doesn't do much for me other than being a fun flick without much of a plot. Fans that are really into the movies will probably be disappointed because the storyline is more about chases, action, &amp; special effects. It focuses less on the philosophy. Not as good as the first one. Then again most sequels are that way.
0786880708|5.0|Dr. Kabat-Zin's work is deceptively simple. In order to learn about how to be mindful, this book must be read in a mindful way. <br />Each page, each thought, each phrase is to be read and savored. Don't think about it too hard, or you will squeeze the magic out of his words. Read, but let the words talk to you; don't use mental faculties to reason, ponder over, intellectualize. <br />A masterpiece.
B00005JLSE|2.0|I just don't get what the hype is all about. It's a movie that features the biggest stars of our time and I just feel like the media made it into a much bigger deal than it should have been. I didn't really like the characters because their not worth rooting for. One is a manipulator and the other a murderer and they got rewarded for it. Why would I want to root for those kind of people? I dunno, I just didn't like it but that's just me.
B00008AWOD|3.0|I like Placebo.  I do.  I wrote a review about Black Market Music becuase I think that's a great album.  It was raw, you know?  But this, this is a little too much like R.E.M..  And before the Placebites flip out, I'm just saying that the album is a little over-produced.  Sometimes, this has great results, like &quot;Special Needs.&quot;  But it just don't have that &quot;stank,&quot; as Ike Turner would call it.   Black Market Music was raw.  This is . . . uhh, well done.  And I believe I have carried the metaphor to far.  It's worth buying, but I was a little dissapointed.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Peter Gabriel is a fascinating artist who has released many masterpieces ('Security', 'Peter Gabriel 3', 'So') and has never showed any signs of selling out or pandering to popularity. This collection ups the antie of 'Shaking The Tree', with material from 'Us', 'Up' and his soundtracks over the years, but definitely misses the opportunity to give the public a definitive collection of his work. To have all of his great songs, it would be impossible with a two disc set, much like Bob Dylan or The Beatles, but to achieve a two-disc set that can at least represent the various stages of his career would be more than feasible.<br />The problem with this set is that it relies much too heavily on his latest album, 'Up' and has nothing from 'Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch', and nothing from 'Passion', which is criminal. 'Peter Gabriel 1: Car' is only given one slot here, with the obvious 'Solsbury Hill' (the version of 'Here Comes The Flood' is from the 'Shaking The Tree' collection, not from the first album). It seems that Gabriel is ashamed of his first couple albums and seems to think that his new work is his best. The breakdown of the distribution of songs from albums are as follows: There is one song from his first album, nothing from his second, four songs from his third, three songs from 'Security', five songs from 'So', nothing from 'Passion', four songs from 'Us', five songs from 'Up', and the rest are from soundtracks, or are unreleased songs.<br />It is strange that his last few albums have so much time on this release, but his first few albums seem to get the shaft. Also, some omissions seem strange, like 'Come And Talk To Me' from 'Us', which was a hit, and 'I Have The Touch' from 'Security' which was on his previous greatest hits collection. I guess he, or the record label, didn't want those albums to go out of print.<br />'Hit' is a solid, if not top-heavy, collection of songs by a pioneering, creative artist who defies categorization. I guess people who only knowa few songs won't care that a few tracks from his second LP and 'Passion' are missing, because they never get played on the radio. This collection isn't to be avoided, but definitely buy some of his great albums before or after getting 'Hit.'
B00006CXXU|3.0|After the death of teen-pop, all the artists that made it huge during that time tried to mature their sounds. Christina Aguilera was in a particular place, because unlike most of her peers, she has genuine vocal talent. In fact, she is one of the most interesting and versatile vocalists of her generation. Which is what makes her second release so confusing, rewarding and at times frustrating.<BR>Her voice is a powerful instrument, able to belt out notes and wail soulfully. She uses her instrument, excessively at times (as do most vocal athletes--Celine, Whitney, Mariah). The album has many strong points-they outweigh the faults. The faults, however are significant, too, which is why they prevent this album from being truly remarkable.<BR>The album's lead-off single, \\"Dirrty\\" which features a rap by Redman, is exactly what is wrong with the album. The song is Aguilera's confusion of trampiness and being skanky, with being sexy and provocative. The lyrics are salacious, and Aguilera sings them with a disdainful attitude-almost a business-like, been-there-done-that attitude that strips the song of any emotional resonance. Also tiresome is her \\"Infatuation\\" which is an example of when Aguilera conveniantely remembers her Latina roots. \\"Impossible\\" with Alicia Keys also dissappoints-considering the talent behind the song.<BR>The songs that do work, though work very well. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"with Lil' Kim is an example of Aguilera's attempt at growing up, working splendidly. A feminist-anthem, the songs details the double-standard between men and women, in terms of sexuality-a topic too rarely disscusses,especially in popular music/culture. Also good is the guitar-laden \\"Fighter.\\" The album's strongest highlight is the heart-wrenching ballad, \\"Beautiful,\\" which Aguilera performs, well, beautifully.<BR>Overall, a good start to a growth of an artist.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I decided to rent this atrocity only because it received the best picture Oscar and was expecting something better. What the hell all the hype is over is beyond me. I'm a Generation X'er and this must be a nostalgia trip for the Baby Boomers or something. I can't stand musicals and this tried I guess to be a good drama mixed in with singing and dancing? It didn't do anything for me. I turned it off after about 15 minutes. I guess I grew up with too much violence, sex and profanity to stomach something like this.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|With the death of &quot;teen-pop&quot; officially here, many pundits predict the deaths of many of the artists that took advantage of the boom. Spears is probably the movement's most successful artist--<BR>With her new album, &quot;In the Zone,&quot; Britney Spears is attempting to cross-over into the adult-artist arena, and shed her teen-pop image. This is difficult, because not only is her body of work, so of the time, but her voice is also severely limited, that it makes her sound like a child at times.<br />The album takes an edgier approach to dance-pop. The beats are harder, and have a stronger hip-hop influence than her other works. <BR>The first single is an indication of the album's weaknesses. &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; is a funky, staccato-beat affair, with Spears dueling with pop uber-icon Madonna. The mix of the two isn't all that strange, since truth be told, Madge isn't much of a singer either. But the song, while catchy and interesting, lacks any punch or interest. Instead, the two trade off verses, not using their limited voices to their full potential (as they have in the past). The song is exactly what is wrong with the album--musically ambitious, but joyless and lacking any spark or charisma (of which both Spears and Madonna have to burn).<BR>The other songs on the album are also a mixed bag. They all are well-produced, but lack any of the trashy fun that marked Spears' earlier work. <BR>There are moments, however, when the album does shine. &quot;Breath on Me&quot; is an excellent song, with Spears' utilizing her breathy purr to great carnal effect. The backdrop, with its icy-disco beat also works, making the song almost intrancing. Also good &quot;Touch of My Hand,&quot; which is a celebratroy anthem of self-love, which again benefits from Spears' ability to sell a song. The vaguely Middle-Eastern touches,along with the insistent dance-beat make this song one of Spears' best. Also good is the MATRIX-produced &quot;Shadow&quot; which is agrande ballad, complete with guitars and strings. <BR>However, these three songs are the only highlights on the album. The other tracks are coldly efficient-- except for the R.Kelly-helmed, &quot;Outragious&quot; which should have been titled &quot;Ridiculous.&quot;<BR>This album is clearly Britney Spears' way of earning a place among other dance-pop divas like Janet Jackson and Madonna. She lacks Jackson's and Madge's musical vision and artistry, but the bright spots on the album indicate, that she might be able to pull off a career as a legitimate artist.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I want to return here and write a belated review of this middle album. I have enjoyed TTT more this year (as we have waited for the theatrical release of the movie TROTK) than TFOTR album. This puts my opinion in the minority, I know, from what I have read: most fans enjoy the Fellowship album more than Towers. But I think it is because of the &quot;unfinished&quot; quality of the story in the middle. The music in this movie is simply grand: the Rohan theme is awesome and raises goose bumps: so does that violin solo (Eowyn's personal theme music, I figure). Howard Shore's genius is that he won't &quot;chintz&quot; on the score: he insists on creating new variations of earlier themes and adding new ones as the story brings in other elements. Having now heard the new TROTK album, I can appreciate TTT even more: because Shore did the same thing there: he elaborated on themes from this middle score and thus the whole &quot;trilogy&quot; of albums becomes an amazing production, worthy of appreciation on musical excellence merits alone, without even worrying about the films.
B00004YRQA|5.0|If you have a PS2 you must get one of these. Only get 1. you will only need 1. This thin has about 8000KB and most games use 100-500. or even lower. It took me 3 years to completely fill up this thing's memory. And I have about 40 game saves on it. So buy it.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Having now heard all three film scores, I have to say that they blow me away. Taken as an entire piece, the score for TLOTR doesn't even have to be compared with the films for which it was written to be judged some of the greatest orchestral music ever completed. When TFOTR first hit theaters, I stopped on my way home after having watched the film and bought the CD at once. It has remained amongst my favorite music ever, and (other than John Barry's score for &quot;The Lion In Winter&quot;) far exceeds (IMHO) all other film scores that I have ever enjoyed over the long years. Consider the length of this score (over 9 hours of film to write music for), and when you listen to the distillation of all three albums (over 210 minutes) this swelling production leaves you thoroughly immersed in imagery: you feel as though you have journeyed in fantastic realms. TFOTR was the beginning of the establishment of Shore's musical themes: the remainder (the bulk) of the story - TTT and TROTK - build upon TFOTR's stunning foundation.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Most everyone I think has heard Nickelback.... but if you haven't then I suggest that you buy this CD if you like Puddle of Mudd you will love Nickelback.... if you are into modern hard rock then Nickelback is for you.... this CD may only have 10 songs but it packs more punch then some cds with 19... I know I would rather have a 10 song CD with all good songs then a 19 song CD with 3 good songs.<br />1.) Never Again - 10/10 - GREAT SONG.... little rough but very good for it's point.... very good opening song... the lyrics to this song are asome for its point.... once you hear this song you will like it.<br />2.) How You Remind Me - 10/10 - Yea shure this song was a little over played on TV and on the Radio but hey its still a good song... sometimes the TV and radio turn a good song bad by playing it to much.  Thats why I don't listen to the radio that much they run the songs in the ground.  This song has a point like most of the other songs by Nickelback.<br />3.) Woke Up This Morning - 10/10 - Little fast but I like how they put it together ... it's a little hard to catch the point on this one but you will if you really listen.... that's the way Nickelback is you have to (really listen) to there music to get it.... but if you are a true music fan you do that any way.<br />4.) Too Bad - 10/10 - Nickelback at there best ... this song has a vey good meaning and helps get a point across to some people ... really good song I listen to it almost everyday along with the rest of the CD.  If you do not catch the point of this song you have something wrong with out.... in fact if you don't get the point I suggest you do a search on [...] and find out what it means because you need to know... maybe you will wake up.<br />5.) Just For 10/10 - We are half way through and still perfect :-) .... I like the way this song sounds .... I think most people will.... kinda of a angry song but like all of there songs it has a strong point.<br />6.) Hollywood 10/10 - Heavy song ... very good... Chad has good vocals in this song and you will find the meaning hidden in it in time.... I really like how it is put together.<br />7.)

B00005JM02|2.0|This movie was horrible I hated it and thats a surprise, because I usually like Disney and Pixar movies.The only reason this piece of trash got 2 stars from me is because the little turtle( i think his name is Squirt) is cool ( star 1). The second star is because I felt bad only leaving one star. I may hate this movie but I love it compared to sept. 22 reviewer from Freddy vs. Jason. Well thats it, this move blows don't see it. 'till next time everybody. Later
B00008BXJ6|2.0|Not much here.  High Voltage, and TNT are about the only songs that are worth a repeat listen.  Production is low, and the group really had not developed as song writers, if you want to call what they do song writing.  This is not the AC/DC of later years.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|\\"Escape\\" is simply incredible!All of the songs are extremely good and though I bought this album long ago I still haven't stopped listening to it!My personal favourite is \\"Hero\\" and I believe that it is the best romantic song I have ever heard!I can dance to it for hours,even days witout getting bored!I believe that \\"Escape\\" is Enrique's greatest album and \\"Hero\\" the greatest song he has ever written!I recommend it to all of his fans!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Before I saw this DVD I thought there is no way this concert could be better than the previous one I saw, boy was I wrong! This is truly an awesome performance by music's #1 female performer! And to top it off an outdoors concert in Chicago!! Shania had that park so jammed full of people there was no room for anyone else.Her vocals on this DVD are just amazing, and that's very difficult to do LIVE,but she breezes on through song after song singing her best! Her interaction with the crowd is just amazing as well.Shania keep it UP girl!! You are truly an amazing singer songwriter!! This DVD is a must buy for someone you know who loves music!!
B000002GBJ|5.0|Rick Wakeman has produced a lot of music in the last 35 years, but this second solo album of his still is his is among his best, if not his best. Based on the BBC television life of Henry VIII's caprious attempts to further both his family's hold on power and England's revolution against the Papacy, Wakeman's music really has little to do with the history, real or imagined.  Still, this Album does capture some history - that of early analog synths and samplers, and of an era of musical freedom.<br />Conceptual failure notwithstanding, Wakeman produces six long tracks that have a cohesion that does hold up. Trained for a time at the RCM, Wakeman absored lessons on structure along with a lot of beer.  The focus of each song is based on thematic material that Wakeman explores as any classical composer might do, but with the instrumentation and rythym of jazzish rock.<br />Take Jane Seymour (not Dr. Quinn) for example. The piece starts out with a church organ playing a Bachish modal theme. A harpischord answers the organ in counterpoint, and them finally a Minimoog enters, doubling the organ's new thematic material, now in an ominous minor theme. Occasional drums add tension to the piece, but the organ keeps returning to the main theme and its variations.<br />My favorite is the jazzy \\"Anne Boleyn,\\" which comes closest to portraying the alluring and doomed second wife of Henry. Wakeman again establishes a flowing theme, works it out on the piano, then contrasts with a new theme on rock instrumentations.  A quiet interlude with acoustic guitars, basses, and background vocals accompany's Wakemans' restatement. The piece builds back to the the rockish part, then moves into a minor key movement, introducing a newer faster theme and electronic instruments.<br />This simply good composing, arraging and playing, and to me it hasn't aged as fast or as badly as people claim. Not as bad as I have aged, anyway.
078681859X|5.0|Perhaps no novel will ever live up to Harry Potter but this one comes dangerously close.  It's about a boy-Nathanial-who is a magician's apprentice.  He's a very intelligent 5 year old boy who Arthur Underwood-a magician-takes reluctantly as his apprentice. Only Mrs. Underwood and his drawing teacher seem to like him.<BR>Nathanial (in a few years) starts to learn the arts and precision of magic-which is just basically summoning and containing demons-and learns it all eagerly.  All goes well until he meets Simon Lovelace who embarrases Nathanial beyond reason in front of many magicians.  After that all he has is revenge on his mind. <BR>He decides that his learning is going too slow for him to get his revenge and teaches himself magic through Mr. Underwood's books.<BR>He later summons the djinni Bartimaeus to aid him with his revenge.  Bartimaeus adds the humor and brightens up this morbid story.  His footnotes give you the insight you might need to understand some words-maybe not-and they are also very funny and are bound to make you roll on the floor with laughter...anyway...Bartinaeus is sent to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand from Simon Lovelace.  Bartimaeus returns after much persuit with the amulet and recieves a command to put the amulet away.  Everything goes downhill from there.<BR>Where downhill does it go?  I'll give you some hints...a demon/magician duel...spying...prison...and now that I have told you those, why don't you go read the book?
B0000CAQ26|4.0|i never liked pink; but got this cd after listening to &quot;God is a DJ&quot;, to my surprise i like the rest of the tracks as well...<BR>to others like me; get it man; it's worth it.
B000002LND|4.0|wow did anyone else read the review from that girl who was pissed off about this cd just because there was no brittany spears on the record? wow, that was really a very pointless review don't you think?! <BR> Now, my question is why did she buy the album without trying to confirm the whole brittany thing? You don't just spend twenty dollars on some cd just because someone tells you one thing and you believe it immediately before confirming it. my god, honey did you know your also being lied to every day or would that be perhaps stretching it? <BR> now, perhaps next time you'll actually go looking for brittany music instead of looking in a madonna cd. By the way if your such a brittany fan why didn't you just buy her cd that has her music on it? Duh! <BR> anyway, I just had to say something about that so called review! <BR>Now, from a Madonna fan I think this was a good cd to have if you've always liked her old stuff.  So buy it~! thanks !<BR> P.s. if only we could some how erase that stupid review?
B000089RVR|5.0|dido doesn't let you down on her second offering; i loved the entire cd; haven't stoped listening to it even since i bought it. if you liked her first album; you're gonna love this one.
0767821629|4.0|If you haven't seen the film then go out and rent it first because it's not for everyone, espicially if your very much a matrix fan because this film doesn't go as deeply as you'd like it. <BR> The reason I gave this film a 4 star is because it's gengre is rarely done well or for that matter done right. Like the matrix, it travels deep into the human mind to create a feeling of unease and distrust. In that I mean that one shouldn't believe what they see all at once until they've seen it all. Although the film doesn't have that element of serious intrigue like the matrix it still in it's own way gives you just what your looking for in terms of a sci-fi film without all the special kick ass moves that matrix is so well known for. Instead the film deals with how a good technological invention can turn deadly then moves into a field of smoken mirrors in which what you've seen has completely changed it's meaning and once again you are forced to replay the story line in your head to understand how it all works. <BR> By the end of the film (which I will not tell you because that would be wrong) you are left with this sense of &quot;awww&quot; in which you think &quot;geeez, I would have never guessed&quot; which is just what the Matrix did for most people. Of course, I shouldn't be comparing two (as far as I'm concerned) completely different types of sci-fi films but these days if you haven't seen the matrix and your interested in this film then go out and rent it. Besides it does you no good to be out of the loop. <BR> Anyway, to get the point across thier are some great performances in this film and often your left wondering where the next plot twist will lie. Although their were other wonderful actors in the film, I loved espicially Vincent D'onofrio just because he's the perfect villian and innocent bistandard all in once. Truely this film is as much a mystery of the sci-fi gengre as the Matrix is to Neo so do try to rent it and if you like it think of buying it. It never hurts to have a wide variety of sci-fi films at home! <BR> Thank you! enjoy!
0689835604|5.0|THIS HAS BEEN MY SON'S FAVORITE BOOK SINCE HE WAS BORN AND THE FIRST HE REACHED OUT TO TOUCH.  AT 12 MONTHS OLD, IT'S NOW ONE OF THE ONLY BOOKS HE'LL SIT STILL FOR!!!  HE LOVES TO LIFT THE FLAPS TO SEE WHAT'S HIDING UNDERNEATH.  THIS IS A VERY STURDY AND FUN BOOK FOR A WIGGLING, SQUIRMING 12 MONTH OLD BOY!!!
B000002H33|5.0|this is a great album that every one will love! include ppl who like pop or something(that includes me). i would give it thousand stars if i could!! it's definitely a must-buy!
B00005B4GU|5.0|This CD comes off as a very sad CD. It is. Keep in mind almost every song on Amnesiac is about lead singer's, Thom Yorkes, divorce. The emothion of the times caused him to write some pretty good stuff.<br />1. Pact Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box- Starts out with intregng metalic drums, only gets catchier with guitar and words.<BR>2. Pyramid Song- A good combination of piano and long, sad, lyrics.<BR>3. Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors- Yorke's voice electronicly altared, this song takes some time to warm up to. <BR>4. You and Whose Army- Best fight song ever. This is not a traditional fight song though. It is, like the rest of the album, slow and well thought out. You really need to listen to the words to get it which is hard because this song might swallow you in it's great climactic end. Yorke's voice altared but not as harshly as Pull/Pulk.<BR>5. I Might Be Wrong- Heavy bass. Not something radiohead usually does but something they do quite well.<BR>6. Knives Out- The reason I bought this album. This is a fast, regesive, ballad, with 3 guitars, all of them played extrodenarily well. <BR>7. Morning Bell/Amnesiac- Yorke brings out the high voice from &quot;High and Dry&quot; for this excelent and sad song that makes the insperation for this album VERY clear<BR>8. Dollars and Sense- A very average song that is part electronic and part Radiohead rock, but not like anythig else on this album. This is arguably the worst song on Amnesiac.<BR>9. Hunting Bears- An intermental song. Repetitive, creepy, mainly an intro for the next song. Sounds sort of like I Might Be Wrong but you can see the connection to Like Spinning Plates. Nuff said<BR>10.  Like Spinning Plates- Another high pitched melody that does an exelant job of displaying frustration, sounds better with Hunting Bears.<BR>11. Life in a Glass House- Pure genious. After a 20 sec electronic intro it's all Jazz. Radiohead doing jazz? Yes, and I love it! This song has the best jazz in a long time, it is not weather channeljazz. After a while just listen to the trumpet and clarinet, they are amazingly well played.
B000000I3O|5.0|The Misfit's Collection is possibly the worlds greatest CD ever. First of all, I had the wrong kind of introduction too the Misfits. I first bought Famous Monsters because it had a song named Scream and the cover was cool. Childish, eh? Well i liked it, i liked it alot. Then i did a search on them and saw their complete discography. Next time i had spare cash, i bought every misfits album i could find. Eventually i had every misfits title on both compact disc and vinyl (eBay). Now this, Collection II and Legacy of Brutality are probably the albums i listen too the most. Now first off, Glenn Danzig frigging rules. His voice is both smooth, haunting and angry - like a Rebellious Zombie Elvis, heh - if you can imagine that. I love all the tracks on here, every single one of them, but my favorites include: Bullet (Read the lyrics, it makes Eminem look like Barney singalong), London Dungeon (excellent, slower song for the Fit's and very dark), Were Eagles Dare (one of the catchiest sogns ever and awesome chorus), I Turned Into a Martian (Very catchy punk tune), Die, Die My Darling (awesome awesome song, very catchy, hard punker) and Horror Business (awesome, almost like an anthem). All the tracks here simply rule though, i mean it's The Misfits for the Crimson Ghost's sake! The Bottom line is - The Misfits own your soul, You should own this cd (all of them for that matter) and if you don't you should be shot.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|It might be the girl's 4th album, but some songs, literally made me want to cry, and no not from emotion, but from the fact that Britney sounds like a dying dried out old goat in heat.<BR>The melodies and beats, in some songs are nice and catchy . I loved the melody in \\"Touch of my hand\\" with a little asian sounds, and \\"toxic\\" that sounded like some techno western music, really rocked, but her raspy voice cannot reach many notes, and ruines pretty much anything she sings. Actually her  attempt to \\"sing\\" is blasphemy! It's like calling processed cheese food, provolone cheese, or comparing spam to brisket.<BR>Britney is trully an intersting mutation of a female  zygot, but she ain't a singer.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Hello, this is my first Britney Spears CD. My first love is R&B and Hip-Hop, and this is a terrific CD. I really didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you like good dance/hip-hop/pop/r&b music, then this is the CD to buy.<br />I didn't even know which song was supposed to be about, you know, until I read it on a message board. It's actually a well written song. It's done in good taste. Nothing offensive. I was to busy dancing to the beats so I didn't pay attention, at first. In my opnion, this CD isn't too sexy or vulgar. <br />I do recognize that Britney doesn't sound like Christina or Mariah, but does she have to? I think this CD is a big improvement from what I've seen and heard on MTV. I think she sounds a lot better on the new material. The dance and hip-hop tracks work well. Britney does have a unique quality to her voice and it finally shines through on IN THE ZONE. <br />Britney really experiments with her vocals and it's refreshing. A lot of recording artists sound the same on every song, but she doesen't. She separates herself from the other pop/r&b divas by showcasing her voice's felixibility on many of the tracks. You won't get bored with this collection.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|A must have!!!<BR>My family hasn't been able to stop playing it.  This CD is absolutely beautiful, and I wish the jealous hater's would stop writing hateful reviews.  It is quite obvious that they haven't listened to this wonderful CD.  Anyone that says this CD isn't beautiful must be tone death because Whitney's voice is as clear as a bell!!!<BR>BUY THIS CD!!!  I GUARANTEE IT WILL PUT YOU IN THE HOLIDAY MOOD!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's new CD is her best effort. IN THE ZONE is a CD that you don't want to be without. It's a completely new sound for Britney, one that I think you'll enjoy. It has many dance/club/hip-hop like songs. It has a lot of energy, and you won't want to stop playing it. I hope people keep and open mind and welcome the new Britney.<br />I'm just disappointed that Amazon.com likes to post as many one star reviews as they possibly can. They also post reviews that have nothing to do with the CD and only contain personal attacks. Someone needs to investigate this sad, pathetic, childish company. All the profanity and foul language need to be removed. Don't worry about listening to &quot;trashy lyrics and content&quot; on Britney's CD when you can read such filth on Amazon.com. You'll want to run out and buy her CD for some good, clean fun.<br />This website is like a carnival game, it's rigged. Amazon.com, GROW UP!!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|In a word, this album is unbelievable. Chris Cornell proves once more that he is one of the greatest visionaries in modern music, and does it in a way that will blow your mind. Tom Morello's signature guitar playing shines through in every track, and the same in-your-face fire that he had during his Rage days is still as prominent as it ever was, especially in tracks like Cochise and Set It Off. &quot;Audioslave&quot; is a must-have for just about everyone. Fans of Soundgarden will still find the same magic in Cornell's unique vocal syle, Rage fans will appreciate the hard-edged drum and guitar lines, and anyone interested in a truly original, imaginative, and well-executed blend of two styles of rock, will not be disappointed.<BR>(Just a note for fellow guitarists: I learned almost every song on the entire CD within 3 days of buying it. They're fairly easy to figure out, but they sound good and give you lots of room to put your own spin on them.)
0060987464|5.0|This is a really interesting book about the life of Marilyn Manson. You follow him through adventures in satanism, paganism, sex, drugs, music, even his grandfathers basement. I read this as a big fan of Manson, but it was really an amazing read dispite the fact that i already have a great deal of respect for him. he's an amazing musician, and also a great writer. His life is full of twists and turns, and i dont think i can say anything bad about the book. I couldnt put it down. Its an addictive read, and i hafta suggest it to anyone that isnt easiy perturbed by fairly graphic journeys through drugs and sex
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am a writer and editor, and work a lot with teen music. I have met Britney Spears and think she is a doll. But I've never liked her music, except for &quot;...Baby One More Time,&quot; which is one of the best pop singles of all time. Until now. I really, really love this CD. I did not expect to! But I feel that it's her first real album. It's cohesive, it takes artistic risks (the primary one being that it is not shy about being about having fun) and has a sense of excitement missing from her previous work. As the world's most diehard Madonna fan, it pains me to say I don't love &quot;Me Against the Music,&quot; but it did grow on me. Same with R. Kelly's laughably written but undeniably catchy &quot;Outrageous.&quot; &quot;The Hook-Up&quot; is one to skip, but not an aural assault or anything. The rest, I embrace. &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; is one of the best songs of all time---I can't get enough of it. It's like &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; or &quot;More More More,&quot; breathy and satiny and a pleasure. My other faves are &quot;Toxic,&quot; &quot;Early Mornin',&quot; &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; and &quot;Shadow.&quot; &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; is a giddy tribute to Madonna's entire career---it sounds like &quot;Material Girl&quot; and throws in &quot;Ray of Light&quot; guitars. And &quot;Everytime&quot; is absolutely sweet and sincere, the perfect antidote to Justin Timberlake's uncomfortably vicious &quot;Cry Me a River.&quot; Great record. Try it if you like pop and dance music.
B000003TAR|5.0|in my opinion this album is their best work...very different from Nevermind but still very good...here are my views on each song<BR>1-serve the servants-10/10 I like this song as the opener of the album. real good guitar riffs and the lyrics are pretty interesting if u listen to them<BR>2-scentless apprentice-7/10 This song is good just not one of my favorites. kurt gives alot of energy into the lyrics of this song<BR>3-heart shaped box-10/10 this song is excellent. some of their best work.  starts of sort and when the course comes it just exploids with massize guitar and kurt screaming his heart out&quot;hey! Wait! I got a new complaint!&quot;<BR>4-rape me-10/10 this song is probably my favorite on the cd. real good guitar riffs/chords and i love the end when kurt is screaming Rape me!<BR>5-francis farmers will have her revenge on seatle-9/10-this song is real good..starts off sorta quite with guitarQ notes and then a cool guitar riff/chord comes in<BR>6-dumb-9/10 i like this song alot. it is different than most of the songs they have done. the cello is an awsome part of the song...so is kurts singing in this song...its real mello<BR>7-very ape-7/10 this song reminds me alot of scentless apprentice...its not my favorite...still enjoyable to hear<BR>8-milk it-9/10 this song is the probably the hardest song on the album. it is one of my favorite nirvana songs ever.  in the beginning and throughout the song it has a base line and guitar q notes where it seems like they are talking to eacher through guitars sorta..its real different..it also has an exploding guitar riff in the chorus and through the chorus kurts screaming vocals are some of his best best ever<BR>9-pennyroyal tea-8/10 this song is thought to be maybe one of the best nirvana songs...it defenitly is good just i dont like the leading up to the chorus...very good though<BR>10-radio friendly unit shifter-7/10 this song is too long for the way it is layed out and i dont like the lyrics much but some might disagree<BR>11-tourettes-8/10 i love the guitar riff in the song...u cant understand what he is singing most the time but i like it<BR>12-all apologies-10/10 this is my second favorite song on the album. it is excellent...not much more to it...also an awsome ender to this album
B00009TB5G|5.0|A review for the non - fan of the Lord of the Rings.......<br />If you are reading this, I am assuming you are shopping for a friend/loved one. Most fans will have already gotten this special edition DVD set and will love it like I do. So, if someone you are shopping for has asked for the NEW Lord of the Rings DVDs as a present, this is what you want to buy for him/her. <BR>Keep in mind that this comprises the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. If you want the first movie, it is entitled &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and comes in a box set just like &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; The third movie &quot;Return of the King&quot; will be in theaters December 2003 and I expect the DVD set of that will be available around the end of 2004.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|(...)I have been listening to them since the first CD: WDDU and probably the Berklee Cafeteria. I am not quick to heap praise on a band just because I like their previous work and will not just buy anything with my favorite bands logo on it. All that said this is an excellent CD! The imagery is dark, the music is heavy in the groove and the performances are stellar. After reading some reviews, I expected this CD to be almost unrecognizable as DT. How quickly you all turn. I have enjoyed every DT release but I have to say this ranks at the top. If you can't hear the melodies; open your ears, if you can't feel the emotion: open your soul. This band has put its collective(...) on the table and in the wake of yet another fantastic Dream Theater CD; some of you run for cover. (...)
B00005JLH3|5.0|First I would like to say I hope my review comes out right cause last time I had some problems. Anyway... It is very clear that some reveiwers are just plan haters. I respect everybodies opinion, but I can tell that some people dont like the movie not because its bad, but for some other reason. How in the world are you going to compare the &quot;Breatfast club&quot; some tasteless 80's trailer park movie to Drumline, it doesn't make sense! If you have some type of bias views why even bother, cause all you are doing is confusing other consumers with your dishonest reviews. Now to my review... I rented Drumline last year and right after  decided to buy it, its a wonderful movie every one should see it, but its not for the haters.
0385504209|4.0|I wish I could say that Dan Brown's novel was gripping from the git-go, but it isn't. The beginning is gripping. The curator of the Louvre is murdered, but his murderer allows him enough time to die that he can form his body into a *symbol.* Next the police are rousing from a too short sleep the protagonist of the story who happens to be a renouned professor of *symbology* from Harvard University. So far, so good.<br />Then the novel bogs down. Key to Brown's story is his interpre-tation of Da Vinci's &quot;Last Supper.&quot; Each participant at the Supper has his own goblet. Supposedly this means that Da Vinci did not mean that the Holy Grail was a goblet. Brown does not mention that there are other historical discrepencies such as Jesus and the Disciples are sitting rather than reclining. The Disciple to the left of Jesus supposedly has the figure of a woman. If so, this Disciple is not the bustiest. Jesus and this Disciple supposedly wear the same colors of clothing. However many characters in the painting wear blue and red.<br />The reader needs to allow Brown some latitude to tell his story. However it is distracting to read that (p 245) one of the characters pulled a book called _The Gnostic Gospels_ off the shelf and proclaimed that it contained &quot;photocopies (really?) of the Nag Hammadi and the Dead Sea Scrolls.&quot; Enjoy the mystery, but don't get get caught up with it.
B0000683WG|5.0|If you ever wanted to know T. Rex's significance in the music world, look no further than this album.  &quot;The Slider&quot; became Marc Bolan and his band T.Rex's calling card. This album when released in '72, sold amazingly well.  The term T.Rexstacy was often used to describe the hysteria caused at a T. Rex concert back in the early 70's.<br />From the bombastic opening track, &quot;Metal Guru,&quot; to the final track, &quot;Lady,&quot; you get as close to a perfect album as you can get.  Marc's lyrical poetry combined with the production talents of Tony Visconti equate pure musical brilliance.<br />You get quite a variety of tracks on this album, but all in all, this can only be described as sounding like T. Rex; I really find it hard to equate to anyhting else.  This truly defines what became known as the T. Rex Sound.  My personal favorites are the added singles, &quot;Thunderwing,&quot; &quot;Lady,&quot; and album tracks &quot;The Slider&quot; and &quot;Rock On.&quot;<br />Marc was never as big in the United States as he was in the United Kingdom (much to his chagrin), but this album came as close to breaking him big here in the US than anything else he put out.<br />Disc Two contains alternate versions as well as demo takes.  It's not bad listening, but serves the purpose of a musical blueprint, detailing the thought process behind each song.  Much of this material was released on &quot;Rabbit Fighter: The Alternate Slider&quot;.<br />Marc Bolan was much more than a pretty face.  He wrote, played, and later in life, produced his own music.  T. rex has earned it's rightful place as one of the of great rock and roll bands of all time.  This album is one of many Bolan compositions that justifies that honor.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack is definitely Shore at his best.  It's wonderful to hear different themes again from The Fellowship of Ring, such as the Rivendell theme and Hobbit related ones.  This CD is definitely a work of genius.  Buy it NOW!
0823003035|4.0|Tony Ryder is perhaps one of the most talented American artists in Modern Realism.  His oil paintings of figures, portraits, and still life are brilliant, but he is also a skilled technician in figure and portrait drawing using pencil.  This volume, &quot;The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition&quot;, is, in my opinion, a good choice for those who want to improve their figure drawing technique.  The book describes Tony Ryder's protocol for pencil drawing of figures: block-in, contour, and drawing on the inside with an understanding of gesture, light, shadow, and form.  This method is extremely painstainking and requires great patience: according to Ryder, he spends an average of twelve three-hour sessions for each complete drawing (i.e., 36 hours per each finished drawing!).  The book also contains dozens of his excellent, inspiring figure drawings of models from diverse ethnic groups.  However, this book is not for those new to drawing: it lacks the lesson plans and exercises needed for beginners. If you are a real beginner to drawing, perhaps you should start with Betty Edwards' &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot;.
0920668372|1.0|As mentioned in the review, the mother sings a song \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\"  When the child in the story is young, this is very appropriate.  But when the child grows into manhood, the mother goes to his house at night.  When she sees that all the lights are off, she uses a ladder to climb into his window, cuddle him and sing the song.  This is sick!  I'm not sure what this book is trying to promote, but I doubt that stalking,  breaking and entering is something we want children to learn.   In addition, rocking the grown man while saying \\"As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be\\" is a little warped. <br />I think the story is tender when it comes to singing to an infant and a child.  But, climbing into the grown man's window just turned me off.  I could NOT like the story from that point on.  In fact, I couldn't even give this book away, I needed to throw it away so no child will see this.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The &quot;X Men&quot; saga continues as the X Men, Magneto, &amp; Mystique join forces to battle an evil general bent on destroying all mutant life on Earth. The film is quite an improvement over the original (that film seemed to take too much time setting up the characters w/ not much time to tell the story. Not so in &quot;X2&quot;). The visuals are pretty cool w/o getting annoying (like &quot;Harry Potter&quot; &amp; &quot;The Matrix&quot; films). The characters are what (like the first one) fuel this story. Die hard &quot;X&quot; fans should keep a sharp eye for the following mutants - Colussus, The Beast, Gambit, Syren, &amp; Jubilee. I have no problem watching this film over &amp; over. Great stuff.
0385504209|2.0|With all of the hype I expected this to be plausable, gripping and exciting.  It was none of the above.  I am in the religion business and to believe this you have to suspend a lot of &quot;belief&quot; and accept things that are really outlandish.  Despite the Catholic Church's checkered past, this is so beyond belief that no matter how much I tried I just could not accept its premise.  Not only that but the ending is a real letdown.  I found myself saying &quot;So.......&quot;  There are better things out there to read.... far more interesting and believable.
B00005JLYW|4.0|The Angels are back &amp; there in full throttle mode as there hired by the Justice Department to retrieve a set of rings containing encrypted files of the witness protection program. This film is like the opera, you either like it or hate it (if you go into this thinking its Shakespeare then you've got a problem. Come on people! Its based on a jiggly 70's TV show!). The Angels sre great, Bernie Mac is hilarious as Bosley, &amp; the soundtrack is great. The only serious problem is McG needs the action to be more reality based the next time around (that turned a lot of people off). FYI - I personally own a set of the H.A.L.O. rings (the ones used in the warehouse scenes. Yeah, there pretty cool too).
B00005OLAS|2.0|This review applies only to the VHS version.<br />There has been enough written about this movie (especially the non-&quot;director's Cut&quot; version) that almost sank the Star Trek movie franchise before it had a chance to get going.  It's so busy being impressed with itself that it forgets to think about itself.   <br />There are so many &quot;illogical&quot; parts of this movie (as Spock would say) that you can't stay immersed in the story too long before you pop up and say &quot;Now, wait a minute&quot;.  They're in there to add &quot;drama&quot; and &quot;spectacle&quot; but fall flat because they don't make sense.  Without giving too much away for the 12 or so people that haven't heard about the movie:  You've got Capt. Kirk being able to run faster than the Flash as he manages to make it all the way from Engineering to the Transporter room in less time than it takes someone already beaming up to (awesomely) reassemble; an airlock that has a guard on it even though the ship is in deep space  so there's no reason to be there (guard only exists because they couldn't think of any better way for Spock to use the Vulcan nerve pinch that everyone expects him to use Somewhere); a &quot;thruster suit&quot; that is for emergencies, but takes so long to (impressively) tell you about itself and then count itself down that you'd be dead before it finished telling you how it was going to work; said suit that only makes sense if Starfleet had planned for the existence of an intergalactic shortstop, becuase unless there's somone to catch you, there's no way to stop in the suit;  an incredibly wise and knowledgeable sentience (much spectacle) that somehow isn't clever enough to wipe off its nameplate and learn its own name, etc.  <br />To confirm the problems with the flick as originally sold, when was the last time you heard of a tape being pulled and then being rereleased because the version that was shown on TV was Better than the theatrical release?  That's the 143 minute version, and it is.  Note tht this is Not the &quot;Director's cut&quot;, which is also better than the theatrical release.  <br />The 143 minute VHS version, though has something that is not in the DVD version (although it was on TV when first shown).  Not going to give it away, but watch when Kirk leaves the Enterprise to go and rescue Spock (this is not in the other versions, all you see is Kirk catching Spock).  There is a ponderous moment when he (impressively) floats off from the airlock.  You might miss it at first because your mind will fill in what it expects to see.  Watch it again, and you'll see probably the most spectacular gaffe in a released version of a flick in movie history (makes the momentary view of a freeway view in Ben Hur pale by comparison).   Let's just say the scene wasn't quite &quot;finished&quot;.  Again, this is Not in the other versions of the film.  <br />The DVD is better, but this goof has to be seen to be believed!<br />Aside from that, we shouldd all give thanks for Kahn and his Wrath, or there wouldn't have been any more ST picutres.
B000002UAR|5.0|Cause Im the Taxman...yeah..Im the Taxman..I just love this album..I think this and Sgt Pepper are the only GREAT Albums the Beatles released. Magical Mystery Tour is also one of my favourites. Theres so much variety in the sound of each song, a lot of work must've gone into this album. I'm Only Sleeping is in my opinion one of Lennons best songs ever. They really went out on a limb experimenting with all that East Indian sound, I mean most rock bands dont have the guts to try different stuff.<br />Here, There And Everywhere is something to listen to if you are in tune. Yellow Submarine on the other hand is a good tune if you are drunk and in a good mood. She Said She Said is very impressive and groovy...man. Good Day Sunshine is a happy song..Happy songs are hard to pull off, and The Beatles know how to execute with precision. Same deal with And Your Bird Can Sing...they are just better than they knew they were, and all the songs are short and sweet. 5 minute songs are just too long.<br />For No One...is sad yet thought provoking at the same time. <BR>Doctor Robert is more upbeat and changes the mood...see folks! this is what Beatles albums do...they keep you listening..by changing the groove and mood throughout the album! I Want To Tell You may be the only weak spot on the album. Got To Get You Into My Life is a classic! Pauls song is a little bit of a fresh air on a Lennon heavy album. Tomorrow Never Knows is a strong finish. Great sound effects ,a real trip. Could this be one of the greatest albums ever??..I dont know, I personally prefer Sgt Pepper..but this one is a must if you are a serious music listener..like myself..Have a good Day!
B00005JMFO|5.0|Sometimes its enough just to have a lot of fun in seeing a film.  This is a big, stuffed-to-the-gills film, presumably with something to entertain every viewer, but also something for anyone to criticize if they so wish.  I did not so wish, simply because most of it was fun, nearly all of it was funny, and as a whole it is a very good time.<br />Some seem to be criticizing the film for not having more Hugh Grant or other actors, but that completely misunderstands what the film is.  It is not a star vehicle, a la MAID IN MANHATTAN or TWO WEEKS NOTICE from the last Holiday season, but an ensemble piece.  In other words, there is a large cast of actors, and the film tries to balance a number of stories instead of focusing merely on one.  More than that, it is not an ensemble film in the sense of GOSFORD PARK, which uses a group of actors to tell essentially one story.  This film uses its ensemble to tell a number of stories, stories that manage to overlap to a degree, but separate stories nonetheless.<br />Telling several stories at once, some are going to work better than others.  The worst, by far, was the Laura Linney story, in which an American is prevented from a romance with a man to whom she is enormously attracted by her willingness to accept at all times of the day and night calls from her mentally ill brother.  Anyone who knows anything about having a relative who is mentally ill knows that the first rule is setting limits to their behavior, so that it doesn't control the behavior of those around them.  No mental health professional in the world would have allowed the brother to call his sister at will.  But that was the only one of the tales that I found to be absurd.  Most of the others were delightful.<br />My favorite performer was without question Bill Nighy, who stole nearly every scene he appeared in, playing an aging rocker who is trying to get back in the public eye by singing a god awful updating of the Troggs's classic &quot;Love is All Around&quot; to &quot;Christmas is All Around.&quot;  He takes the entire thing as one huge joke, and his joking nearly steals the film.<br />At a time when the American presidency is held in greater disdain in the world in general and in England in particular, there is a particular interesting bit of fantasy in which the British Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, stands up in a press conference to the American President, played by Billy Bob Thorton.  Basically, Hugh refuses to be Billy Bob's poodle.  Obviously, the movie portrays a prime minister the likes of which most Britons would love to see, instead of the way that Tony Blair currently is.<br />I also enjoyed the part that featured Colin Firth falling in love with his Portuguese housekeeper during a trip to France to write, but with whom he could not communicate.  He then learns a smattering of Portuguese, flies to her on Christmas Eve, and then in his halting Portuguese asks her to marry him, with her accepting in the halting English she has obviously just picked up.<br />This is not a great movie.  It will not be used in film classes to illustrate film writing technique or to show the way that the camera can tell a story in a way that is unique to film, but it is a heck of a lot of fun, and if one doesn't take it too seriously, will create a very, very good couple of hours of entertainment.; to &quot;Christmas is All Around.&quot;  He takes the entire thing as one huge joke, and his joking nearly steals the film.  <br />At a time when the American presidency is held in greater disdain in the world in general and in England in particular, there is a particular interesting bit of fantasy in which the British Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, stands up in a press conference to the American President, played by Billy Bob Thorton.

B00005JMCN|4.0|The greatest problem for the movie SEABISCUIT is the book SEABISCUIT, and given the latter's enormous success as a bestseller, I am rather surprised that they filmmakers didn't try to hew more closely to the book.  Granted, given the need to compress the much larger content of the book into the less information-friendly film, things had to be cut out and compressed.  What I found especially disturbing were a couple of major plot details that did nothing to add to the movie otherwise, but in fact were profoundly untrue.  The first of these that bothered me was Red Pollard's confessing to Smith and Howard that he was blind in his right eye, a secret he in fact kept throughout his career as a jockey.  Also, Pollard suffered twice from serious injuries, but because of runtime for a film of this sort, they had to compress the injuries into one, the second one that primarily involved his shattered leg.  Again, many liberties were taken here:  he did not shatter his leg only two weeks before the match race at Pimplico, but sometimes earlier.  And by cutting out Pollard's injury, we are left with the false impression that it was the match race where Woolf rode Seabiscuit as well.<br />See, this is the plight of the person who reads the book shortly before seeing the movie (I read the book on Wednesday and head to the Chicago suburbs to see the movie on Friday):  you end up knowing too much.  I'm not disturbed by what they leave out, but I am bothered by what they put in and alter.  ...  The movie made some unfortunate though perhaps unavoidable changes with Seabiscuit himself.  He was much shorter than the horses he raised, though stockier and short legs.  The horses used to portray Seabiscuit weren't especially notable for their lack of size.  More importantly, none of the horses playing Seabiscuit were able to lock their legs, which Seabiscuit was famously unable to do.  This meant that Seabiscuit, unique among horses, could never sleep standing up, but only lying down.  The inability to lock his legs led to a life-long rumor that he was either crippled or lame.  But no mention to his truly awful legs was made throughout the film, I suspect because they weren't able to find a horse whose legs didn't lock.<br />Overall, I think the film was very well cast.  Jeff Bridges, who has one of he most dramatically underappreciated careers in Hollywood, is superb as Charles S. Howard, automobile magnate turned horse entrepreneur.  Chris Cooper excels as Tom Smith, taking on an ashen and aged appearance that is perfect for the film (he looks so different from his Oscar winning role in ADAPTATION that it is hard to accept he is the same actor).  I'm not sure Toby Maguire was the right choice to play Pollard.  He wasn't the right size physically, but far more badly he is devoid of the famous demeanor of Red Pollard, who had a perpetually mournful expression on his face, causing many to compare him to Buster Keaton.<br />All in all, the movie ends up being more than the summation of its parts.  The movie does possess a great period feel, and if an enormous amount of the detail about the setting up of the match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral was left out, they do a great job of reenacting that race (which according to multiple sources I consulted after reading the book truly is regarded as the greatest horse race of all time).<br />But any reader of the book, to be able to enjoy this movie at all, it going to have to make a pack with oneself to not get hung up on the movies errors.  I was partially able to do this, and was more or less about to enjoy the film.  I do recommend the movie, but I definitely recommend the book considerably more.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|This Album is AWESOME....in my opinion. I loved them the First time i heard them, and I have worn the CD out listening to it...I strongly Suggest anyone theat likes OldSCHOOL rock get this one...Its a real flashback!!!:)
B00000F14B|5.0|OK, I have to be honest here:  I don't like &quot;family entertainment.&quot;  If I go to Blockbuster, I usually avoid the Family section entirely for something a bit edgier or darker.  And although I love Fred Astaire and most Gene Kelly, I am not at all a fan of Hollywood musicals from the fifties and early sixties, when they were becoming more &quot;epic&quot; as the movies tried to provide something that television could not.<br />Nonetheless, I find THE MUSIC MAN to be one of the most thoroughly enjoyable pieces of light entertainment ever.  Primarily there are two reasons for this.  First, there is the great score, the most famous tune notwithstanding (maybe I have heard it too often, but &quot;Seventy-Six Trombones&quot; really leaves me cold).  But nearly every other song is utterly delightful, especially the magnificent &quot;Till There Was You.&quot;  Am I a dork if I confess that I love the barbershop quartet numbers (I was second tenor in a high school quartet)?  But as fine as the score is, take away Robert Preston and you have at best an average, forgettable film.  Preston today is remembered almost exclusively for his role as Professor Harold Hill, which is a reflection not so much on his prior career as on the extraordinary job he did in performing this role.  There is a similar parallel with Rex Harrison, who despite a long career on stage and screen, is primarily remembered for MY FAIR LADY.  Interestingly, in both MY FAIR LADY and THE MUSIC MAN, other actors were considered for the lead role, although both Preston and Harrison created the roles for Broadway.  Interestingly, Cary Grant was considered for both films (though Grant very famously responded that he wouldn't star in the film and if Preston weren't cast in the lead, he wouldn't even go see it), though Warners first choice was Frank Sinatra.  Luckily, things worked out, and Robert Preston &quot;owns&quot; the role of Professor Harold Hill like few actors own a role.<br />The film is also helped by a rich supporting cast.  Shirley Jones was her usual excellent self in the film (though it is well known that she was pregnant during the shooting), and the film provided the late Buddy Hackett with one of his finest screen roles.  Paul Ford, best known as the colonel on the Phil Silvers Show, turns in a nice screen performance as the Mayor.  Hermione Gingold, who spent most of her career on stage and had as a result a surprisingly small screen career, excels as the mayor's wife and the leading light for culture in the town.<br />But mainly, this is a great, great vehicle for a great leading man who has utterly nailed a great role.  If Frank Sinatra or Cary Grant had been enticed to play the lead, perhaps we would still be watching this film today, but for some reason I am sceptical.  But I am certain that this is one family film that all but the hardest of hearts will enjoy.helped by a rich supporting cast.

B00005JLYW|2.0|\\"Charlie's Angel-Full Throttle\\" was like watching one long music video.  After a while, you forgot whether or not there was a story line.  You are so side-tracked with all the constantly changing visual affects every other minute.  I believe the story revolved around the retrieval of two coded rings that held the names of those in the witness protection program.  A former angel (Demi Moore) goes into business for herself in stealing the rings and then selling them to the highest bidder.  There is one thing I have to give the movie credit for.  It provides female action heroines.  They can kick any man's butt.  Although unrealistic is approach, it does provide motivation for young women.

B00005JKC3|3.0|.   <BR>The \\"Hulk\\" is a most unusual film.  Although not normal Ang Lee material, Ang Lee himself is the bases for the Hulk's physical movements.  It's entertaining if you don't take it too seriously.  Scientist, David Banner, located in a desert military base uses himself in a regeneration experiment not designed for human testing.  In the process he genetically passes on his altered DNA to his son Bruce.  As an adult Bruce is exposed to gamma rays which set off his already mutilated genes.  A complicated life is revealed piece by piece to Bruce (Eric Bana) as he struggles to understand what is happening to him.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner's strength increases with his anger.  He can reach the heights of 9, 12 and 15 feet tall; he can lift 100 tons, run 300 miles per hour, and jump 3 or 4 miles in a single leap.  In addition, he has the ability to regenerate and repair himself from any sort of physical trauma.  He's the perfect weapon everyone wants to possess.  <BR>There are some animal testing scenes that may not go over well.  Some scenes may be a little \\"nightmarish\\" for small children.  I still smell a sequel.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The clash show off their impressive musical talents, in this amazing album. The clash have a very unique style, not like all the other punk bands, London Calling, the title track is a good example of this. The guns of brixton is another good example, in this track the clash cleverly blend punk with reggae. Then of course there are the less experimental tracks, such as koka kola and four horsemen, which are much more like conventional punk, which of course is no bad thing. If this album only had Should I stay or should I go, it would be the ultimate clash album.
B000127LW2|2.0|I like the voyager series most of all and like to get the whole series, but what i still don't understand why they have this regions and not all availabel languages on one DVD. Is it really the space needed for that? I know, it's a fact, that we unfortunately have to live with that, but so I'm going to wait another couple of months to wait for region 2 with hopefully english, french _and_ german on one single DVD (set). (The region wouldn't be a problem though..)<BR>And I have to agree on the other comment, that it's still most too expensive. Would also pay a maximum of  50,- for one season.<BR>W.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album is great. The highlight of this album, for me anyway, is alive, that is by far the best song on here. Other tracks of note are release and oceans, but they are all good, except Even Flow, this song fails to emotionally move me like the others and it is a very average song. <br />And just for the record, nirvana are a hundren times better than pearl jam and pearl jam are brilliant!

It's great to see him maturing as a filmmaker, and to also see him still writing about life situations/plots. I love this film so much, and it's on my X-mas list for 2003. <BR>It contains a &quot;refugee&quot; cast from &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. Macey, C. Reilly, Moore, Hoffman, Baker Hall, and Guzman. With a few new faces....Tom Cruise, and &quot;Buck&quot; from &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, don't know his real name, just refer to him as &quot;Buck&quot;. <BR>This is the true definition of a five star film.

But, there were so many characters after awhile, that it took great concentration to keep them straight.  For that reason, it became rather slow reading.  The ending was very unbelievable, ridiculous, and confusing.  I struggled to finish because I just didn't care anymore.  I'm sorry I actually purchased the book instead of using the library.  I have greatly enjoyed his other books, so I know he can do better.

B00005JM02|5.0|I am going to talk to you on two different levels regard this film. One, Entertainment Value and two, its Meaning. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich the film is utterly Magical.<br />Entertainment is what this movie is all about. Fun, adventure and the most amazing representation of the undersea world as represented by computer animation in it full realism. The images and colors jump at you one by one as the sea life REALLY comes to life in front of you. ON the big screen it was overpowering...on DVD it's is as amazing as anything I have ever seen.<br />The film is a the story of a Father and Son and the process of father knowing when to let go and a son dilemma over proving he is capable of being on his own. So real in it portrayal it reminded me of conversations I had as a kid with my father. All the bad and all the good that comes with growing up are in this movie. It is very touching - especially at the beginning and even MORE so at the end.<br />Albert Brooks (Defending Your Life, Broadcast News, Mother) stars as Marlin the father Clown Fish and Alexander Gould (Wheelmen, They) the son Nemo. They get separated on his first day of school and the adventure begins. On his way to retrieve his son who was abducted by Humans for a Fish Tank in Australia, he bumps into the fish Dory - dumbfoundingly and hysterically played by Ellen Degeneres (Ed TV, The series Ellen and her own daytime talk show now).<br />Ellen is amazing and Albert is the perfect straight man. You won't believe the clever, witty and charming adult humor there is in this film. Kids will love their antics and fears and adventures while adults will hang on to every word Dory says.<br />Thanks to the help of Schools of fish (Played by John Ratzenberger of Cheers and in EVERY Pixar movie), two very wise Sea Turtles (Played by the director himself!) and a Seagull played by Geoffrey Rush (Shakespeare In Love, Shine, Quills) Dory and Marlin track across the oceans to get to Australia to find his son. The funniest scene is Dory speaking WHALE. I'll say no more! Watch it.<br />Nemo is then greeted and accepted into his new home, which is that of a fish tank installed in a Dentists office deep &quot;Down Under&quot;. With the support and help of Gil played by the sympathetic Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man, Victory) and Brad Garrett (Everybody Love Raymond) as a Blowfish named Bloat - Nemo manages to get out.<br />The story ends - now this is the &quot;Meaning&quot; part I was telling you - with revelation of the importance of friendship, loyalty, family and fatherhood. Their wasn't a dry eye in the theatre when I saw its premiere at the El Capitan in Hollywood and when I just showed it to a few friends for the first time yesterday. Everyone was laughing and crying and went out to buy it!<br />The DVD extras are fantastic. Fish Charades, Games, Story telling and some historical and scientific information about the seas and the eco system of the oceans and coral reefs. The segments are humorously written and performed with the original cast and the Chemistry of Dory and Marlin (Albert and Ellen) is hysterical.<br />Well...the highest grossing animated feature and top selling DVD (8 million copies its first day) this is one to own. If you ever thought of buying one animated featured - just to have - this is the one. My favorite animated feature of modern times. It still makes me laugh and cry!

B0000797IO|2.0|\\"The Good Girl\\" starts out as an honest, unsentimental, and modest film (a la the amazing \\"You Can Count On Me\\") but quickly loses it's focus and falls victim to what independent movies are not supposed to do, which is sacrife characters for plot development.<br />When we firt meet Justine, played in a very un-\\"Rachel\\" manner by Jennifer Aniston, we see small-town woman desperate to escape all aspects of her monotonous life. Her discount-retail job feels like prison, she's married to a stoner who seems to connect more with his best buddy than her, and seems to yearn to have a chance to do it all over again as all her dreams seem more than gone. She might as well be dead.<br />Without giving too much away, I can say that when she meets a sullen 22-year-old named Tom (Jake Gyllenhaal) who for his own reasons seems to want out of this world. It isn't long before their friendship becomes an affair, and I'll leave the rest to you if you have not seen the movie.<br />As good as Aniston's performance is, and it's a gem, Gyllenhaal seems to truly become his character. It's a performance like few I've seen in a while and for a while makes for a promising movie.<br /><br />The whole getting to know you process is well supported by strong supporting performances and the director's eye for small town desperation. The huge problem in this movie is almost everything that follows plotwise after the aforementioned two characters meet and start to get to know one another.<br />Despite the strength of the performances, this film never quite realizes the poignancy it seems to be aiming so it tries to fake it with plot twists to add punch to what started out as a great character study. The movie slowly starts to self-destruct by creating unbelievable dramatic scenarios and situations that belong in another movie or third rate soap opera needing shockers. Two major life threatening developments take place and I can't say which one is handled worse as one is just thrown in for good measure while the other is weighed down by sappy movie of the week melodrama.<br />There is one moment towards the end of this movie where it has a chance of getting back on course but choses to go for a big, multi-character \\"payoff\\", which is unnecessary in a film of this scope. The ending is an unearned as it is unsatisfying as it neatly wraps up people/events/feelings which should never be given such thoughtless treatment.<br />I am very disappointed by this film as I enjoyed the director's debut and here he seems to be suffering from a major sophomore jinx. I hope that his next project goes back to starting out with a strong script and avoids the need to heighten the magnitude of his work by using cheap plot twists.re while the other is weighed down by sappy movie of the week melodrama.<br />There is one moment towards the end of this movie where it has a chance of getting back on course but choses to go for a big, multi-character \\"payoff\\", which is unnecessary in a film of this scope.

B00005JMFO|1.0|I didn't like it. Spoilers are included in this review. I thought that the movie tried too hard. They wanted to use a great British cast and give everyone a storyline, but some of the storylines don't succeed. I wondered why several of them were even included, some of the storylines seem incomplete. With so many storylines, I felt like I was watching a soap opera. The movie's about several people who have love interests and try to get together with certain people by Christmas.<br />I didn't understand the Keira Knightley storyline. She is a married newlywed who finds out that her husband's best friend has a crush, he eventually tells her & she is faithful to her husband. So what was the point of that storyline?<br />The Alan Rickman storyline was weird because he walks a dangerous line and flirts with an office worker, and then when his wife confronts him about it, he admits to it. Then the next time that we see them again, its at the last scence of the movie. Were they able to work out their issues or what? I wish that Alan Rickman's character was less passive and had more guts to stand up for what's right. <br />The Colin Firth storyline was so boring, so was the Laura Linney one, and there was a short storyline about two adult film stars that meet while making an adult movie. It was a boring movie. The only one that I really enjoyed was the Hugh Grant one where he played a prime minister. Billy Bob Thornton plays a short part as the U.S. president that hits on Grant's secretary. Ugh. <br />A better way of using this wonderful English cast, would have been by having one main plot and all the actors play leading and supporting parts instead. That would have been a much better movie, and they should have taken out all the smutty parts.

Here is a perfect example of a honest music buying person paying for crap.
B00005JM0B|4.0|\\"Terminator 3\\" is a great, action packed sequel to \\"Terminator 2\\". The terminator that is sent back in time to kill John Connor in this movie is called the TX and she is much more advanced than the terminator sent back to kill John in the second movie. There are many ironic and funny lines through out the movie that give a nice break between the action scenes.<BR> The TX is more advanced than the terminator in the second movie in many ways. One way would be that the TX can turn her arm into a variety of guns, including a machine gun and a fire shooter.  TX is also able to turn her fingers into keys that can start cars or connect to the car's computer and she can run it be the remote in her head. Like the other terminator TX can also take the form of the people she kills but she does not use that ability as much as the other terminator did.<BR> There were many lines in the movie that I found to be funny and ironic but the first was said by Kate Brewster. She was in a furniture store with her fianc, Scott. The marking gun she was using to pick things out for their registry was being faulty and Kate responded in frustration, \\"I hate machines.\\" I found this to be ironic because she really doesn't know how much she is going to hate machines in her future when they take over her world.<BR> During the first action scene the TX is chasing John and Kate in a huge truck that has a crane to it. The terminator played that was sent back to protect John and Katie catches up to the TX and is being swung around on the crane. Suddenly a fire truck comes down the road and smashes into him, tearing him off of the crane and down the road. I found that sudden smash to the terminator to be really funny because no one sow it coming, especially the terminator. It let you take a breath and laugh before the action got too intense. <BR> In the end \\"Terminator 3\\" turns out to be a very funny movie, packed with intense fighting scenes and terminators more advanced, with more \\"toys\\" than the first two movies. I would recommend this move to anyone that enjoyed the first two \\"Terminators\\", and enjoys edge of your seat action.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I read the other reviews and I keep seeing this trilogy compared to Star Wars by John Williams. The problem, for me anyway, is that Williams best of those three was Empire Strikes Back. Star Wars set up his themes and he perfected them with Empire, falling into mindless repetition with Return of the Jedi. With this trilogy, I agree that Fellowship is the best. Absolutely magical, affecting me like no other music has probably since Empire Strikes Back. The Two Towers was not as strong, but still well worth listening to. With Return of the King, Shore of course has to use themes from the first two, but has changed them subtly so they seem fresh. The new work is almost as majestic as Fellowship.<br /> No one seems to have touched much on Annie Lennox's ending song. This song nearly brought me to tears the first time I heard it. I admit to some bias as a Lennox fan, but these lyrics are haunting, and I dare anyone to not be moved by it.<br /> It seems silly to me to want this music to stand alone, although in my opinion it does. These are not symphonies. But for these movies, the music would not exist at all. Of course it has to be descriptive of what's happening on screen, that's it's job. I feel that Shore HAS trencended that and IS a vital part of the whole. Certainly an excellent end and I look forward to (hope for...?) the release of extended cd's of ALL the music.
0312263120|1.0|Reviewers seem to love or hate this book.  Those who loved it, were impressed by the techno-babble and enjoyed the action.  The rest of us realized what nonsense Dan Brown wrote whenever he strayed into any technical area (not just cryptology) and found the characterizations thin and the plot predictable.<br />My question is, how can Mr. Brown have so little pride in his work?  Many of the technical/scientific errors would have been trivial to correct.  Did he not even bother to have it proof read by someone with even minimal computing/science knowledge?
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|If you wish to hold in your hands the best album ever heard, seen, produced, or recorded, order Céline Dion's 1 FILLE &amp; 4 TYPES.<br />1F&amp;4T is extroadinary.  It is different than any album I've ever heard, and it's VERY different from Céline's English works.  These songs have SOUL!  CDs like this don't come around often; everything is covered here with grace, simplicity, and quality: From rock (TOUT L'OR DES HOMMES) to something between 80s and the future (APPRENDES-MOI) to soulful light rock (LE VOLE D'ANGLE) to country-rock (NE BOUGE PAS) to haunting ballads (TU NAGES), everything is covered here -- and those listed above are just the first five tracks!  This is an awesome CD that shows Céline's range of ability is even wider than her range of notes.  Now, if only we could get an Anglais album like this...<br />...oh, one more thing: make sure to stay tuned for the ghost track, VALSE ADIEU. It comes on about 64 seconds after the beautiful DES MILLIERS DE BAISERS, and is definately worth the wait.
B00007FOMP|4.0|I'm not much of a soul fan (since I am white), but I get chills every time I hear Marvin Gaye's song \\"What's Going On?\\" mainly because of how disgraceful this world has become and how he put it. I've heard that the album has been considered to be the best of the 1970's; but how can a soul album beat all the great rock LP's of the decade like \\"Who's Next,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Physical Graffati,\\" \\"Born to Run,\\" \\"Rumours,\\" \\"Hotel California\\", and \\"The Wall\\"? I think the reason is simple: Gaye's album looked back on the gosh-awful 1960's; in which it started with President Kennedy's murder in hate-happy Dallas and climaxed in Vietnam (that is why I think the legacy of that decade can be sumed up in one word: Overwhelming); and you can make the case that the album fortold what was going to happen with Watergate, the hostage crisis, the space shuttle disaters, and even Gaye's own tragic death. There is one title on the album that I found most interesting and it's a phrase every bastard from Lee Harvey Oswald to Saddam Hussein basically forgot: \\"God is Love\\". In the world of Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\", history does repeat itself.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This is the best cd i have bought. They are the greatest band alive!!!!
044022165X|5.0|THIS IS ONE GREAT BOOK.  A LITTLE SLOW IN THE BEGINNING BUT THEN IT TAKES OFF.  WORTH EVERY MOMENT I SPENT READING IT.
B00004T9UH|2.0|Well, if you don't already know by now, 'The Marshall Mathers LP' is one of the best rap albums ever released, right up there with 'Ready to Die', 'DoggyStyle', 'Return to the 36 Chambers', 'The Chronic', 'Death Certificate', 'Here Come the Lords', 'Southernplayalistic..' and so on.<BR> <BR>  However, unlike the edited version of 'The Slim Shady LP' (with its excellent sound effect-laden version of 'Just Don't Give a F'), there's pretty much nothing here to warrant an edited purchase. I don't recall any songs on this version that use sound effects/voice samples instead of just 'silence' on the voice track whenever an offensive enough swear word is said. There is something here though that isn't on the standard issue parental advisory version, which is the superb B-side 'The Kids' in place of the somewhat intense 'Kim' track. The only problem is that all of the drug references in the song are played backwards, making me think that when Em really says 'Ecstasy', it sounds more like 'deez n*ts', just to give an example.<BR> <BR>  I hold this album in such high regard that I bought the double-disc asian version, which has 'Kim' as well as 'The Kids' in uncensored form, not to mention 3 instrumental tracks and an awesome Danny Lohner/Marilyn Manson remix of 'The Way I Am'.<br />  The bottom line: Unless you get offended easily or have a young kid who wants you to buy this cd for them, forget this edited version and get the explicit content ver. instead. I agree that a lot of the lyrics are inappropriate for young 'uns (especially the 'Kim' lyrics) but if these issues don't apply to you, I recommend the import version (if you're a die-hard fan like me). If you're a just a casual Em fan then chances are you already have the regular version of this album, but if you haven't picked it up yet and are looking for a facinating trip of sex, drugs and violence laid over a cartoonesque pop-rap sonic backdrop, be sure to do so as soon as possible because this album is Em's number one masterwork and will probably never be topped by anyone (himself included).

B000063DFQ|5.0|When my friend recommended Iron Maiden to me, I was a little skeptical. For some reason I had viewed Iron Maiden, before actually listening to it, as some sort of death metal band. Maybe I envisioned that because they like to put zombies/demons/whatever on the front of their albums. This was a case where I definitely made a mistake in judging the CD by its cover.<br />When I first listened to it, I wasn't that impressed. Sure, I liked the beginning of &quot;Still Life&quot;, but after the first 2:44 it went downhill...or so I thought at the time. In truth, I just didn't listen to it enough to really appreciate the amazing guitar work. However, I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of Bruce Dickinson's vocals...it's not that they don't sound well with the music, it's just that I don't like that high pitched type voice (you see, I'm used to listening to James Hetfield of Metallica). Nevertheless, I didn't feel that not liking the vocals affected my enjoyment of this CD too much. There were several songs where I DID enjoy the lyrics as well as the guitar work.<br />I'd have to say that my favorite song on this CD is &quot;To Tame A Land&quot;. It really demonstrates the right way to have a song over seven minutes that is interesting the entire time. The guitar work in that song is so varied that you often times forget you're still on the same song. I made that mistake the first few times I was listening to the song...I started falling asleep and then woke and thought that the CD started over again, but then I realized my CD player doesn't do that, and I was like, &quot;What the...?&quot;, and then it dawned on me that I was still listening to the same song. It really is that varied. <br />Another of my favorites was &quot;Flight of the Icarus&quot;. This was one of the few songs on this CD where I thought the vocals were absolutely astounding. I love midway through the song, when the lyrics start, &quot;Just a babe in a black abyss/No reason for a place like this&quot;. That may be the best part of any song on the entire CD.<br />There were, however, a few songs I didn't care for. Number one on that list was &quot;Quest for Fire&quot;. How can you take any song seriously that starts off with &quot;In a time when dinosaurs walked the Earth&quot;? I like songs that actually mean something to me, or can express in song what I feel emotionally. I don't think there is an emotion that would correspond with that. <br />The other song I didn't care for was &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;. There really wasn't any one reason that I would pinpoint for not liking that song, it just didn't appeal to me. Maybe it's because, again, I couldn't really relate with things like &quot;You killed your first man at 13&quot;, etc. It might also have been because I don't like hearing two or three voices singing at once, to me that sounds like I'm at my sisters middle school chorus concert, espcially when they are as high pitched as those in this band. <br />Overall though, I really liked this CD. It was definitely worth my money, and it also gave me something new to listen to now that I've heard every Metallica album. The friend that recommended this to me said he thought it was their best album. I can't be the judge of that since this is the only one that I've heard, but I can honestly say that this is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time, and I'm definitely going to be purchasing more Iron Maiden in the near future!

B0000CAQ27|4.0|I am a HUGE Pink fan.  I drive my husband crazy litstening to her.  I have all three of her cd's.  I think this album is great, just not my favorite of her cd's.  I do like the album though.  My favorite song on here is &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot;.  Its has a great vibe to it.  I like the fact that she is always changing. I was expecting the parental advisory sticker though, thats not like her to use foul language though.  But I like the fact of the limited edition dvd, which is cool also.  Love you P!nk!
B00005JMFO|3.0|The movie consists of quite a few sub-plots, where characters in which of them are somehow connected. The director put together great great actors but it seems like each sub-plot was directed by different person so uneven they are. It ranges from very funny stories of aging rock star or british guy going to Wisconsin because American girls like british guys, to cheesy story of relationship between father and son after the death of boy's mother, to totally predictable story of love of british prime minister (played by Hugh Grant) to the lady on his stuff. Hugh Grant, by the way, again disappoints: he just plays the same kind of character he played in many other movies. Overall, great actors shooting blanks in many cases.
0142000663|5.0|My favorite book. Simple. I love this book. I was not someone who was forced to read it (although we did do Catcher in the Rye for English, and I loved it still) and all the can say is &quot;ThiZ book sux!11!1&quot; Steinbeck is a master storyteller. He is not a master of the language as say, Dickens, but that is why he is so brilliant. I feel like I'm right there with the Joads. I've read this book three times in a year, and I always love it. Steinbeck's writing is so simple, you feel like you are listening to your grandpa tell a story. His initial description of Grandpa is hilarious! I love how he changes back and forth between the Joads and the scenes of the other migrant farmers. Two scenes really stick out in my mind. The car dealer and the trucker diner. Steinbeck's style makes you feel like you're in the diner right next to Al.<br />  Steinbeck's characters are simple, static,and one dimensional, but this works for this book. They are simple people, and help Steinbecks universal message of oppression.<br />  If you want to start reading great books, start here.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|The Hot Beats are the only things interesting then this horrible pathetic excuse of an album, britney still cannot sing as madonna can, the writing is horrible, and the title should be called out the zone instead this, What a horrible<BR>this album belongs with g-unit's beg for mercy and metallica's st. anger as the worst album of the year.
B000000Y27|4.0|OK, so the father of Jazz guitar is Charlie Christianson, but Was is his son, who, ummmm, had a baby , and it was Jazz guitar. Shut up. LOl. Ok, the sound quality is not as good as some others, and the playing is second best (next to Smokin at the Half Note.) Wes is not the most technical player, but he sure is the most emotional and soulful, and that more than makes up for it. I like Smokin better, but this album is great too.

B000002BE9|5.0|This album is my pick over the two she released. This album just feels so natural, like your favorite fleece sweater.It's incredibly sincere, with beautifully written songs sung with great emotion.The lyrics are poetic, and sometimes breathtaking.There are many nuances added to make the music sound authentic and different.This album isn't perfect, but that's what makes it so appealing and lovable.Every song is good.The opener hits you with hard beats and a half spoken, half sung delivery.The second song is a beautiful ballad, Sullen Girl, that's almost lulling and hypnotic.Shadowboxer, the next track is a swaggering ballad.Criminal, is awesome.Sexy and sad at the same time.Slow Like Honey is just gorgeous. Sung with such nuance and feeling, and with such beautiful lyrics.The First Taste has a bit of a Latin feel to it, and its just gorgeous.Never is a Promise has lovely swelling strings, and is heartfelt and sincere within its words and delivery.The child is gone is another keeper.It sounds a bit like shadowboxer, but bellow the tough surface is a fragile ode to loss of innocense.Pale September is seemingly a song with no direction, but that's what makes it all the more beautiful.It's simply a song that takes itself places with no fear.The closer starts out quiet, and swells into a gorgeous, gallant chorus.This album is soooooooo good. I never hype things up, but each and ever single song is a keeper.Her voice is deliciously supple and incredibly emotive, and her songwriting abilities are incredible, she's like no one you've ever heard before.Get this, for an unpolished set of songs that work for ever mood.Love it.
B000002HMH|4.0|Quentin Zavior dude is an idiot. Even though this isn't the metallica we were used to it still ROCKS!
B000069CWE|5.0|hey, i'm a punk, a metal head, stuff like that, so i didn't get attached to Linkin Park right away back in the day of Hybrid Theory. but, god, this is some beautiful, emotional, art-ful stuff right here man!!!!! if you don't like electronic stuff, stay miles away from this album, but if your ok with simple, tasteful...beautiful piano (done by lead emcee, Mike Shinoda) and violin...and cello (done by bass player, Pheonix) then this is your thing. even if you think it won't be...BUY THE THING ANYWAY!!! SUPPORT THE BAND!!! BE A GIVER!!!<br />extremely good cd. keep doing your thing, LP. you can't possibly fail, based on your current success. good stuff. yeeeaah....
B0000DJZA0|5.0|First the cd...EXCELLENT!  I've been a Coldplay fan from the start but the only thing better than listening to Coldplay is listening to them live.  Blasting this cd in my car makes me feel like I'm at a show again.  I love it.  They included many of their old favorites and added a few new tracks such as &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and the amazing &quot;Moses.&quot;  Before the cd was released I heard &quot;Moses&quot; on the radio one day and almost drove my car off the road as it was one of the most amazing things I had ever heard.  Chris goes into U2's &quot;Pride&quot; chorus at one point and it is incredible.  The guitars and everything blow me away.<br />The dvd...AWESOME!  If you haven't had the opportunity to see these guys in concert then at least see the dvd.  Chris Martin has such incredible energy on stage.  They are such amazing performers.<br />If you love Coldplay, you will love this set!  Get it!
B00004Z459|5.0|this is good stuff. i mean, really. WE'VE ALL FELT THESE WAYS!!!. This is not exactly rap metal, if you look into it. more art-ful. take the instrumental &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;, for example. it's not hip hop. it's not metal. it's not even crappy mockeries of them. it's Linkin Park. It's their style. this being their first album, they're just experimenting. they were new on the scene when this came out, and sorry to all the Linkin Park haters out there, but they look like they're here to stay based on these facts: their 2nd album, Reanimation (a bunch of remixes),, BROKE THE RECORD ON SELLING THE MOST REMIX ALBUMS. EVER. PERIOD. these guys obviously put some thought into this music, also. who else could get all that rapping and screaming on an album without a single f-bomb? look at &quot;Forgotten&quot;. how the heck can anyone deny that it's pure genius? these guys are constantly changing, but this is what we'll remember them  for. bottom line: Hybrid Theory is a classic compared to a lot of crap made between 1997 and 2003, and it's got a lot to back that up with. this is FUN music. this is the stuff some of us need. millions, possibly billions for all i know, of fans can't be wrong<br />oh yeah, and Hybrid Theory didn't change their name to Linkin Park to get next to Limp Bizkit on the shelves. in 1999 they were going to release their first album, but soon found out that another band had the same name. It's now a rare CD called &quot;The Hybrid Theory EP&quot;. **smiles victoriously**<br />might be a few typo's, but there's my review of this fantastic CD.
B00005YXZH|5.0|You don't need to be a prior fan of Wilco to be a fan of this album; you only need to like good music in an otherwise sorry time for the industry.  This was my first exposure to this band and I'm a little beside myself that I hadn't heard it earlier.  Fans of radio hits - go away, we don't want you here anyway.  This album is absolutely stellar - I heard it first at a buddy's house and it blew me away immediately.  The songwriting is fantastic (&quot;Reservations&quot; is one of my favorite new songs) and the production that others complain about only enhances what an already talented band can put on tape.  So what if it's not another &quot;Being There?&quot;  Do we really want bands to churn out the same old stuff?  This is hands down the best record I've heard in two years or more (&quot;Yoshimi&quot; is close, &quot;Elephant&quot; is close, but YHF takes the gold.)  If you're simple- or narrow-minded, put on something boring and stare at the wall.  Otherwise, do your brain a favor and get this album immediately.  If you're disappointed, go on back to watching reality TV and Jerry Springer.
B00008H2LB|5.0|ok i am geting INCREDIBLY SICK of all these people writing reviews for this cd when they obviously DON'T like Linkin Park in the first place. these reviews are to HELP people out, NOT to bash your least favorite band. only people interested in Linkin Park are going to read them anyway. save it people, ok? unless you really think the cd sucks compared to their first 2.<br />OK there's my \\"little\\" speech of the day. onto the review: this album is freakin great. these guys are not just another nu-metal band. they have TASTE. their music isn't just angst, IT'S ART, PEOPLE!!! lets look back to all the other artists, old and new, in different genres: they complain just as much!!! Blues: being sad and complaining about it! EVERYONE sings about relationships. what else are you going to sing about that won't get someone mad? the only topics anyone writes about are: depression/angst/anger (all just free expression), or sex and drugs. now, the latter can get old. not everyone is gonna connect to drug rehab, but EVERYONE can FEEL: everyone gets angry/sad.<br />This stuff is more than just a beautiful display of acoustic and electronic drums, occasional keyboards, guitars ranging from relentless fury to (i don't know how to say this but...) \\"emotional\\" harmonics, creative loops, scratching and sampling, and two vocalists with some great live talent (and i assure you, live, they are unbelievable. they use no back up tapes, Mike, you know the rapper dude switches between singing, guitar and keyboards AND they beef up some of the songs with some cool extra-stuff), IT'S ART, DUDE. listen deeper, and you'll find more to them than angst...and sometimes you don't have to look to hard. take \\"Breaking The Habit\\". basically angst-free. it's about changing you ways and having to go through the slow process of it and dealing with the slower process of having everyone else change their mainds about you.<br />so here's my extreme review. it's all honest. all good and natural stuff i just said. uh huh. THIS CD FREAKIN ROCKS!!! buy it...if you have the nerve to stand up to all that don't accept something for what it is deep down.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I enjoyed the music to \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\", but they felt like unfinished works, the ends untied.  And for good reason:  the movie epic the music depicts was itself unfinished.  Now, with \\"The Return of the King\\", everything comes together at last.  And the result is an orchestral masterpiece.<br /><br />Many composers are capable of writing perfectly serviceable music for a film score, playing fast and exciting music in chase or battle scenes, tender music in romantic scenes, and pastoral music in country scenes, such as the Shire at the beginning of \\"Fellowship\\".  Sometimes, as James Horner did with \\"Titanic\\", it can strike a very powerful chord, and the music can ride around in one's mind for months on end, the tunes utterly unforgettable.<br /><br />But very few composers, to my knowledge, can develop different themes for over a dozen different characters and places, then skillfully weave them together into a sonic tapestry, so rich in detail that it is actually possible to listen to the music and follow the story's plot line in one's head.  John Williams has done it, with his \\"Star Wars\\" saga.  And now Howard Shore has pulled off a similar coup with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".<br /><br />Brought together, on this CD, are the hobbit/Shire themes, the heroic/Aragorn motif, the elvish choral music, plus the stirring martial music depicting the Riders of Rohan.  Added to the brew is the ominous Dies Irae-type Nasgûl music, found in the track \\"Minas Morgul\\", and the pounding percussion reminding us of the orcs.  And, new to \\"The Return of the King\\", is the grand Gondor motif, especially notable on the track \\"The White Tree\\".  Filled with brass instruments, it fairly sings.<br /><br />Having read the book several times over the years, but not yet having seen the movie, I could nonetheless guess at the plot line just by reading the track titles and listening.  The music from \\"Shelob's Lair\\" reminds me of a cross between the rock troll in the Mines of Moria and the infamous shower scene in Psycho.  Could Sam and Frodo be running into something particularly nasty in the darkness?  It's safe to assume that this scene is going to be very intense.<br /><br />The one track which really refuses to leave my head is the last, \\"Into the West\\".  When I saw on the track listing that the singer was Annie Lennox, it gave me pause.  Enya singing \\"May it Be\\" I can understand, but Annie Lennox?  I had mental images of a woman with bright orange hair belting out, with her trademark strident voice, Eurythmics hits like \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"I Need a Man\\" and \\"Would I Lie to You?\\"  But it works beautifully.  The voice is strident, true, but at the same time very tender.  I can very easily imagine myself staring blankly at the screen as the end credits roll and this song plays:  \\"What can you see / On the horizon? / Why do the white gulls call?\\"<br /><br />How come guys like me don't get to go to Valinor?  It doesn't seem fair, somehow ....<br /><br />What more can I add?  If you liked the first two CDs, you'll certainly like this one.  Count on it.
1570429596|5.0|I really enjoyed this program. I bought the book and the tape at the same time. Rich Dad Poor Dad is well worth your time with no downside risk.<br />And I can relate very well to Mr. Kiyosaki. I well remember discussions my parents had with our family when I was 9 and younger. Our parents really drove the need to be financially responsible and we had an uncle who was an entrepneneur and drove the entrepneneurship philosophy. I can can still hear Uncle Sam saying; \\"Whatever you do kids, make sure you go in business for yourselves. No employer will ever pay you as well as you will pay yourselves.\\" Uncle Sam also emphasized saving 10% of what we made. Giving 10% to our church and taking another 10% and using that for capital money to expand our business. We were taught this as 9 years olds.<br />For that reason, I and my 2  brothers and 1 sister have been self employed since graduating from college. My parents and my Uncle Sam both emphasized education. Although it has taken a major portion of my life to unlearn what the teachers told us and use what really works.<br />What Kiyosaki says about a house not being an aseet is also true. Fortunately, I never got caught up in keeping up with the Joneses. I own a home. Enjoyed nice appreciation but have fared far better with the rentals that I own than with the home that we live in. I have also made 1,000% plus returns in stocks (small cap stocks as Mr.Kiyosaki recommends) and didn't  have to deal with points, fees and other nonsense that banks charge.<br />Owning rental properties has also offered me tremendous tax benefits so I agree 100% with Kiyosaki in recommending real estate as an investment.<br />The problem with home ownership is that people are investing all their money in their home and constantly tied to a job to pay for it. Then you have the points and fees. Sure their are tax benefits but after all costs are included it's like paying a dollar to get 30 cents back. Not a winning strategy. Conversely, you can live in a smaller home and take the cash that you would be paying for that bigger home, the alligator and use that to buy rental properties, small cap stocks, invest in your own business etc to generate cash flow now. <br />As far as appreciation, you can earn those kinds of appreciation immediately in rental properties if you buy right.<br />As I understand Kiyosaki, he is not against owning a home as long as you realize that it is more of a liability than an asset. I have turned my home into more of an asset by taking advantage of tax benefits of a home based business and renting out a room that we no longer use.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is an excellent book. I am as grateful to Mr. Kiyosaki for sharing these ideas as I am to my parents and my Uncle Sam for reering me and my family to correct financial strategies when we were as little as 9 years old.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I loved this movie.  Only film I've seen in the theater where the audience clapped at the end.  Given, the audience was mainly filled with little kids, but I still felt it was worthy of the applause.<br />Even though Barrymore's accent is pretty bad and she can be a bit stiff sometimes, it has a terrific story and her character's naivette offsets any poor acting.<br />This film draws an emotional connection with the audience and leaves you in a great mood by the time the credits roll.
B00005JMFI|5.0|When I saw the previews for ELF on tv, I really didn't think it would be all that good. But, when I went to see it with my daughter I realized I was wrong! It is a wonderful movie that truely captures the spirit of Christmas. My all-time favorite Christmas movie has always been A CHRISTMAS STORY. ELF is only holiday movie I have seen that is as good. <br />There are no \\"bad words\\", no sexual situations or innuendos and it is just a great movie for everyone! <br />I love ELF!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie has all the requisite summer movie ingredients:  lots of action, adventure and special effects.  It also has something many summer movies don't have:  humanity.  All of the characters in the film are deeply challenged and have to deal with painful decisions and loss.  Bryan Singer does an excellent job keeping the action moving and the characters developing.<br />The three sequences that resonated most with me were:<br />1.  Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike.  Up until this point in the movie, Wolverine has probably killed or disabled dozens of adversaries without showing any emotion other than anger.  Then we get to see the shock and horror on his face when he realizes he's killed the only other person with a mutation similar to his own.  This moment shows us that there is a real human being lurking under all of that rage.<br />2.  Iceman running from his parents' house after Pyro's rampage.  He turns and looks back at his (formerly) loving family for probably the last time.  In that moment, he knows nothing in his life would be the same.<br />3.  Pyro joining Magneto and Mystique.  All through the movie, we see Pyro chafing at the restrictions placed on mutants  under Professor Xavier's direction.  This choice, like many decision teenagers are faced with, will shape the rest of his life.<br />The movie have similar developments for all the returning X-men.  These were just the ones that I found the most compelling, which makes me think that anyone who watches this movie will find their own resonating stories in one or many of the X-men!
B00009L1TA|4.0|This film is a stylish, military thriller and murder mystery from the director of `Die Hard with a Vengeance', John McTiernan, that maintains its tension and intrigue from start to finish.  By their definition, thriller/mysteries are designed to keep you guessing throughout the tale, and a big part of the entertainment value is the process of determining the identity of the killer. This film indeed keeps the viewer guessing and continues to do so until the end. There are some of us who have that ability to watch any mystery film and deduce the culprit's identity within the first ten minutes of the story. (I'm not one of them) But I would bet anyone my last dollar to figure out this film's ending, the final twist is exceptionally clever and surprising.<br />It was also a pleasure to see Travolta and Jackson together on the screen again. After seeing this picture, I was reminded of that intense charisma and power these two actor's command on screen; both have that undeniable star quality that shines in every project they do.<br />Overall this is a well-crafted thriller/mystery that rivets the viewer's attention from the start, and doesn't let go until the final scene - first class entertainment.
B00005JM02|4.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is beautifully produced, but not as engaging (in my opinion) as the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies.  Like so many Disney productions, it succumbs to cutesiness and softens its edges so as not to scare the little ones... but loses something in the process. None of the supposedly &quot;scary&quot; scenes convey the menace of the sequence with the nasty kid next door in Toy Story. And after a while the relationship between Marlin and Dory becomes more annoying than endearing.<br />There's no doubt that the folks at Disney and Pixar know what they're doing, as shown by Nemo's huge box office success.  It's a fine film for kids 5-10 years old, and won't drive parents to distraction.  But it's just a bit too soft-centered to rate up there with the best of Disney's offerings.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Beautiful Album..Beautifully produced, composed, written, and of course sung.<br />Aguilera honestly is a amazing talent that deserves far more recognition for her music and skills than she unfortunately receives. It seems here in America people can't seem to get passed her provocative image and use that as an excuse not to recognize her as a popular and exceptional young woman. It is quite sad.<br />'Stripped' deserves major recognition at the Grammys in 2004. It will be a serious injustice if Aguilera is not awarded with anything involving this wonderful album come Grammy Nite.
B000006045|5.0|&quot;Mezzanine&quot;, the entrancing album from Massive Attack, is far and away the best album of this genre out there today. Every song is dark and mysterious, and the two standout tracks are &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Teardrop&quot;. Each song is very layered, calm with an underlying fury, and topped off with haunting vocals by several different singers. This is one of those albums you can lose yourself in, surpassing others of the same genre such as Morcheeba and the great Portishead. I strongly recommend this album, as it the definition of what trip-hop should be, a vast improvement for Massive Attack, as I believe this album to be much better than &quot;Protection&quot;, &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, as well as their followup to Mezzanine, &quot;100th Window&quot;. <br />The bands best, the genres best, get it.
6304698690|3.0|A simply marvelous, visually stunning and heart warming and charming story; complete with excellent music scores. The young Kate Maberly shows an enormous amount of depth in her leading role as Mary Lennox.  Andrew Knott was very good in his supporting role as Dickon.<br />All other actors were very good and believable.  That being said it is a very dangerous film for a Christian, as it needlessly subtedly plants New Age philosophy which honors the creation (nature) and makes no mention of the Creator.  <br />What I am referring to is the scene of the children dancing around the fire in the garden and calling out to some unknown pagan god, and the movies' overall theme of a magical garden - due entirely to nature.  <br />I'd give it five stars except for these important misleading characteristics.
B000002HRE|4.0|&quot;Re-Load&quot; is full of the leftover songs that Metallica started for the &quot;Load&quot; album, and most of them hit dead-on, while a couple of them are misses. &quot;Re-Load&quot; has a completely different feel than the album before, as it is much darker, the musical influences more obscure. The whole piece comes across as being more experimental than anything the band has done before, and their dabbling with new instruments on the song &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot; is definitely worthy of originators like Metallica. &quot;Re-Load&quot; is destined to be even more maligned than all their other albums, perhaps rightfully so, but one must also compare this to other hard-rock albums that came out at the time: it is better than most albums of '97. Too many people continually compare everything that this band does with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, to which each new work inevitably fails, since the 1986 album is one of the all-time greats. Look at &quot;Re-Load&quot; from a different perspective, open your mind a little bit, and the songs are better than you would expect. Like &quot;Load&quot;, this is not Metallica the thrash-metal engineers once beloved by all their fans, but a band going through changes, wanting to experiment, and not wanting to release the same album over and over again. <br />Best tracks: &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;, &quot;Carpe Diem Baby&quot;, &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot;, &quot;Bad Seed&quot;
B000005RT8|1.0|How could you possibly say this is better than Tug of War?  I know opinions are like spleens (everybody's got 'em), but where Tug of War had polish and soul, this album is devoid of even the essential Macca charm.  It's unholy horrible.   It makes The Beach Boys Love You (which hit on the synth craze three years before this tripe) look like Pet Sounds (whereas I've always called Tug of War McCartney's Pet Sounds.)  Even the song Waterfalls, which everyone seems to praise here, is way too long.  I listened to this one day while driving a long stretch of highway.  Thank God it only gave me a headache instead of putting me to sleep.    NO STARS for Robert Crosbie.
B000059QY3|5.0|Angela Gheorghiu is fantastic. She has a fantastic voice. She is beautiful. She is a great actress. In the lavish setting of this performance, and along with a really spectacular cast, Angela is the heart of the show. Verdi, who was pretty picky when it came to singers for his operas, would be jumping for joy with the whole cast in this production.

B0000C7PQK|4.0|For anyone who has never heard the music of Enigma, the sounds on this album are truly one-of-a-kind when compared to other forms of music--there is simply no way to describe it, much less assign it a label. I would LOVE to meet Michael Cretu (producer and the brains behind Enigma)and try to understand where he comes up with these amazing sounds.  I only have one critisizm and it's minor--To my ears, this CD sounds significantly more synthesized and less &quot;human.&quot;  There are fewer tantalizing and unique voices.  The music is less thought-provoking and is not as contemplative as most Enigma CDs.  Still, I can't get enough of this CD.  If you've never heard Enigma, by any CD, take it home, turn out the lights, cover AND close your eyes, and then put on some headphones and let this amazing music take your mind in directions you never imagined...
B0000DZEA1|2.0|In all my 23 years as a classical music and orchestral film score aficionado, I have never encountered a finer example of deterioration in artistry as I have witnessed with Howard Shore's music for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br />Though it never approached the heights of any of the best trilogy scores (e.g. Williams' Star Wars IV-VI, and Goldsmith's three Omen scores), the music for The Fellowship of the Ring was nevertheless a solid soundtrack, most notable for its identifiably pleasant though tragically under-explored (some may say understated) leitmotifs.  Shore brought nothing original or technically interesting to the table, but the music did serve its purpose, and occasionally, it even had something special to say about what was happening onscreen (the entry into Dwarrowdelf in Moria -- track 12, 2:06 -- is probably the best and most memorable example), thereby clearly manifesting itself as a singular and essential element of the entire film-watching experience.  It also had two excellent songs, both of which featured two of the greatest vocalists in music today (Cocteau Twins' Liz Fraser for \\"Lothlorien,\\" and Enya for \\"May It Be\\").<br /><br />The Two Towers saw Shore's music sink further into what would become, in his Return of the King score, a litany of lyrical and technical platitudes.  The soundtrack for the second film was markedly unadventurous, preferring to take the all-too-common role of supporter instead of existing as a singular part of the story-telling machine.  When it wasn't (and sometimes when it was) resorting time and again to legato horns and strings (frequently doubled), airy choral passages, ostinato percussion, or the fortification of leitmotif in a shallow pool of technique and expression, it was often predictable in its timbre (strings for sadness and longing, horns for majesty and action, chorus for accenting/doubling sadness or action, etc.), and in the progression of its phrases.  Still, moments of musical goodness shone through, few and far between though they were (e.g. Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas' first sight of the plains of Rohan, their suiting up for the battle of Helm's Deep, and Frodo's falling face-first into swamp water -- which wasn't used in the movie).  None of the songs were memorable, though, although the timbre of Emiliana Torrini's voice in the closing track added something to a lullaby with puerile lyrics and prosaic instrumental phrasing.<br /><br />The Return of the King score may be summed up by the observation that, in it, Shore repeats all of the flaws of the first two scores ad infinitum (Peter Jackson, the director of the three movies, probably hand a big hand in this -- see below).  It is a nigh non-stop barrage of sustained notes, grandiose tuttis, and gross technical overuse.  (Did Shore have to employ reserve strings and horn players?)  His flute and airy chorus in \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" make a nice representation of the tragic figure of Denethor, father of Boromir and Faramir (actor Billy Boyd puts in some fine singing at the end of the track), and \\"Minas Morgul\\" is an intriguing restatement of his Sauron theme; but beyond these, there just isn't much at all to the music.  In fact, there may be nothing to it.  The tracks flow virtually indistinguishably from one to the next, wafting or bellowing along in utterly familiar formulae of legato strings and horns, aimless dissonance (aimlessness is exactly what one should not hear where dissonance is concerned), rumbling percussion, and boy-chant.  This is background music at its most... well, at its most background.  The music is just terrible.<br /><br />Having watched the musical making-of portion of the extended Two Towers DVD, I do wonder how much of the badness in Shore's three scores is the fault of director Peter Jackson.  He clearly did a significant bit of musical managing in all three of the scores, which would be fine if he had some kind of musical background.  I don't see any evidence that he does havesuch, though, and I wonder how much better the music might have been had his input been limited to little more than playing a couple of instruments which he'd never touched before (Jackson strikes a gong somewhere in the Two Towers score, and he might play something in the Return of the King soundtrack).  Better directors like Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick have evinced a respect for music and composers that makes it hard for me to believe that they would ever be as involved in the music-making process as Jackson seems to be (Spielberg has been known to fashion or change large sections of a movie to suit John Williams' scoring, and Kubrick usually used previously-recorded music).  Then again, Howard Shore is no John Williams or Gyorgy Ligeti -- the best Shore music I've ever heard is his wonderful main title sequence for Tim Burton's Ed Wood.  It's a fantastic mix of percussion, brass, and theremin, one that suggests a composer in his truer element.  Nothing else of his that I've heard has been nearly that creative, catchy, and pleasing overall.<br /><br />This score for the final chapters of Tolkien's seminal odyssey of high fantasy is one for the most ardent fans only, that large demographic to whom Peter Jackson and company are superhumans who can do virtually no wrong.<br /><br />Edit: Having taken the objective route of listening to the score again and again (mostly as a result of my love for the movie), I do find the last minute or so of \\"The White Tree\\" quite good (though not very creative); it's a classic example of good build-up, and a defiantly proud and touching statement of the composer's Gondor theme.  Most of the rest of the music is still filler at best, though.  Shame the choral rendition of the fellowship theme isn't on this disc; always trust a studio (and often the composer, for that matter) to leave some of the best music in the movie off the commercial soundtrack.much better the music might have been had his input been limited to little more than playing a couple of instruments which he'd never touched before (Jackson strikes a gong somewhere in the Two Towers score, and he might play something in the Return of the King soundtrack).

B000002UWW|5.0|I have known about the Chili Peppers for a long time, I loved blood sugar sex magik, and was very iffy on californication. I knew that the early peppers were fantastic but I wasn't exactly sure if I wanted to buy their first four albums because of being such a fan of the latter material, I picked this up and it turns out What Hits!? has a hell of a lot more punch and funk then any of the later albums, I love this CD, if it wasn't for this CD I wouldn't have gotten the remasters of the first four albums or heard Hillel Slovak's wonderful guitar, buy this CD.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Si algo puede distinguir este trabajo de la cantante -de ascendencia italiana- es su sencillez. American life es un esfuerzo sincero, introspectivo, a veces nostálgico, que contrasta en mucho con sus obras anteriores, en especial las de los 90s, y sobre todo el horrendo &quot;Music&quot;. Aunque en este caso el éxito arrollador no la acompañó, creo que debe ser satisfactorio por fin tener un disco que pudiera convertirse en un &quot;culto&quot; algún día. Analicemos pieza por pieza este álbum. <br />American life, el primer sencillo a promocionar, salió al aire precisamente en el momento en que la invasión de los EU sobre Irak era inminente. Por una vez en su vida, la diva decidió no ser temeraria, y canceló la exhibición del video original de esta rola (el cual es muy bueno, a decir verdad), ya que contenía escenas bélicas en tono sarcástico que pudieran haber sido &quot;ofensivas&quot; para ciertas personas en la nación gabacha (sobre todo ciertos políticos, ), y no quiso exponerse a lo que sucedió a Mel Gibson y otras personalidades que fueron vetadas por expresar su opinión. Eso restó mucho al impacto esperado por el tema, y pues el video de las banderas era bonito, pero pues no fue demasiado aclamado por decirlo así. Ahora bien, el tema, como ya lo dije, es bastante sencillo a pesar de los arreglos &quot;Hi-tech&quot; que contiene, y en cuanto a la sección de rap que ahora parece obligatoria a todos los cantantes de pop, por lo menos Maddy tuvo la decencia de rapearlo ella misma y no contratar a un negro para hacer el dirty-work. Bien por Ma-diva. <br />Hollywood es tal vez el tema más famoso de este disco. Bellamente adornado por las guitarras iniciales y el sonido de aves, Hollywood trata acerca de toda la gente advenediza que busca una oportunidad en el medio sin importar el precio a pagar. Buen tema para precisamente hacer burla de las nuevas estrellas del pop (léase Britney y Cristina) a las cuales trata como gatas en la presentacin de los VMA's (la del famoso beso) y pues para como siempre demostrar que nunca dejará de sorprendernos. Ya la habíamos visto besándose con mujeres, pero nunca tan famosas.  <br />Ahora toca el turno de I'm so stupid, a pesar del título, uno de los más &quot;inteligentes&quot; del disco. Buen intro de guitarra en un tono muy sencillo recordándonos quizas a los inicios del &quot;acid rock&quot;, para luego hacer uso de programadores y lo mejor de la música electrónica. Love profusion es el cuarto tema del disco, y sería uno de los más flojones a no ser por el excelente estribillo &quot;I've got you under my skin&quot;, muy bien interpretado, por lo menos a mí me hizo sentir o recordar momentos en que realmente tienes a alguien &quot;under your skin&quot;. Aunque también se rumora que esto es en alusión a la nueva religión de la cantante, y que más bien significa &quot;I've got JEW under my skin...&quot; Cuestión de enfoques...  <br />Nobody knows me puede serle chocante a todo aquel que odie la música electrónica o los estribillos estúpidos y la voz modulada por un procesador. Es absolutamente comprensible. No sé, es un tema con afán de atraer adolescentes tal vez. No con esto digo que sea malo. Me gustó eso de &quot;Now I realize how many times I've died...&quot; Nothing fails es un tema que me trae recuerdos personales que prefiero no mencionar en este foro.  Con un afán bastante vaqueril y la sencillez en su máxima expresión, creo que captura mágicamente el sentimiento de estar enamorado, dejando fuera traumas y obsesiones. &quot;I'm in love with you... you silly thing... anyone can se...&quot;. No sé. Me encanta. Es de los que más disfruto de este disco. <br />Después de Nothing fails, o más bien, con ella inicia una serie de tres baladas en el disco, la cual puede parecer aburrida a algunos, pero no a aquellos que puedan extraer lo esencial de su sentir. Intermission, la segunda de ellas, no es especialmente emotiva hasta que llega al estribillo: &quot;And I know, that love will keep us together...&quot; , realmente hermoso y esperanzador. Perfecto para una de esas solitarias noches invernales.  La siguiente, X-tatic process, es un momento nostálgico con aire a trova, exclusivamente de guitarras acústicas y uno que otro arreglo pop. Este track es extremadamente delicioso, que va, es uno de esos momentos Nescafé.  Pero lo más más precioso del tema es cuando dice: &quot;I always wish that I could find, someone as beautiful as you, but in the process I forgot, that I was special too...&quot; Una bella muestra de una dulce renunciación, pero sobre todo de una buena autoestima.  <br />Mother and father es otro de los ya soporíficos recuerdos de Madonna acerca de su niñez, ya lo hemos visto en Oh father, Promise to try, Mer girl, Inside of me y tantos tantos temás mas... En este caso su remembranza no es excesivamente brillante, pero el rap puede ser pegajoso en ocasiones. <br />Muchos opinaron que Die another day no debió haberse incluido en esta obra, pero yo no veo porque. Los arreglos &quot;hi-tech&quot; son realmente geniales, creo que encaja perfectamente en el ambiente electrónico del disco. Además del video que es de los mejores de la carrera de Madonna. Un 10 para esa rola. <br />Por último, no podía faltar un punto débil, como en todos los discos producidos y por haber, y en este caso se llama &quot;Easy ride&quot;, rola nostálgica y con arreglos de cuerdas que seguro es un intento de evocar grandezas como &quot;Live to tell&quot; u &quot;Oh father&quot;, pero aquí se queda muy pero muy lejos, y que bueno que es el último track, así le puedes apagar sin tener que adelantar.  <br />En resumen, muy bien por Maddy que nos demuestra que a sus 45 años aún tiene mucho que aportar a la obra común, aunque el éxito comercial no sea el mismo que el de sus mejores tiemposy ahora tenga que valerse de las estrellas actuales como Britney para hacerse notar. Vale.
B0000C1HLF|5.0|McG and Drew, Lucy, and Cameron have made one of the most entertaining and fun movies I have seen to date. I have watched both movies more than any movie I have in my collection and can be sure no matter what mood I'm in, that this movie will always bring a smile to my face and put me in a good mood. This is genius in what McG has done and hope to see more in the Charlie Angels Series. Do not pass this up, this movie is pure entertainment at it's finest. Much love to all the cast and crew.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|That song it almost tries to hypnotize you \\"Get In The Zone\\" it's telling you to buy the cd... haha. no thats just an observation. Alright let's get down to business. I'm not the biggest Britney Spears fan... i'll start off with that. But I was told to buy the cd and it was on sale so I figured it wouldn't hurt. It kind of surprised me. It's shown growth from other stuff I've heard by her. And i'll admit the first single seems like more marketting then decent music (ok let's get madonna on a half way decent track and make it sell) The rest of the cd has a sound unique to itself, with still potential to grow and expand in many directions. There's the tracks like \\"Boom Boom\\" and \\"Outrageous\\" that try to head to that hip-hop feel with beats and the \\"In The Zone\\" signature outrageously out there sexual lyrics that seem to add something while still incorporating enough buzz around WHAT IS SHE SAYING!!? Then there's songs like \\"Breathe on Me\\" and \\"Touch of my hand\\" that go for the Madonna thing and build up the fact that as much as the public thinks they know this person.. maybe they dont. who would have suspected Britney Spears singing \\"Another day without a lover the more I come to understand the touch of my hand\\" ... ?<br />While the cd does point out flaws in Spears' voice (she sings and talks) it also brings out the fact that she DOES have one. On The track \\"Early Mornin'\\" you hear aspects to Spears' voice that are unrecognizable to MANY people unless you really listen. On \\"Everytime\\" you hear Spears' moaning about love lost, with a good vocal effort (she preformed it live on SNL and nailed it) Other tracks getting huge mention are \\"The Hookup\\", a dance hall track, and \\"Toxic\\"(friggin James Bond meets Wizard Of Oz)I'd say the weakest track on the album is the Matrix produced \\"Shadow\\". It is a far cry from a power ballad, because the chorus sucks. The end remix of \\"Me Against The Music\\" is much better then the radio version. <br />At a recent shopping trip my friend walked into a store and the shelves were CLEARED OUT of this cd and the store was on backorder. Due to Holiday shopping, it should be sellin'. So get it if u can . . .
0316666343|5.0|Lovely Bones is one of the best books I have ever read.  It may seem a little depressing or awful but in reality it's an inspiring book filled with hope and joy.  It's one of those books that you wished you'd read before because it really changes the way you see life and the people around you. It also leaves you with a feeling that maybe what you're going through isn't so bad and there's a lot more good in the world than you see. I recommend Lovely Bones to anyone who just wants to read a good book, it's more than worth the time.  Plus you'll finish faster than you think because Susie's story is so compelling you won't be able to put it down.
B0000CDL93|5.0|i absolutely love this movie. terrific acting, great directing, theories for thought. oliver stone is one of the greatest director right now. definitely my favourite.
6305428387|5.0|Cool runnings is enjoying, funny and most of all, it niques its mother !!
0425152251|4.0|Several people have said that the main fault in Sophie's world was its lack of/weakness of its plot line, but this is rather done on purpose. If certain readers had truly understood the point of the fictional parts of the book, which are to illustrate the philosophies presented and not necessarily to entertain the reader to any degree. Those who call the plot line redundant or unecessary couldn't have been more wrong. The purpose of the book is for 13 year olds like me to read in school and not for advanced philosophical minds who would rather read the confusing translations of the real works of the philosophers. This is still essentially a philosophy book and not so much a fiction, but if you want to read about philosophies in a broad overview and still get some sort of fiction to help you understand and ease the boredom, then i would definately recommend this book.
0385504209|5.0|Great book with an intriguing premise. It makes you think.
0060977493|1.0|I have heard great things about this book and looked forward to reading it.  I was in India for six months when I read this book and could see some of what she was talking about and I found that interesting.  However, that is all I could find interesting about this book.<br />I think she is a good writer, but only on a page to page basis, anything of more duration than that and I just didn't get it.  I read sixty books a year and this is the only book in the last few years that I didn't finish.  I gave up about thirty pages from the end.  The story went nowhere (at least nowhere of interest), the characters were pointless, and I just couldn't force myself to read one more page when I quit.<br />Everyone else thought I had talked to suggested this book and thought it was the duck's nuts.  I just couldn't feel this way.
B00005JMFR|3.0|One thing that sticks out from \\"Reloaded\\" is the Oracle telling Neo \\"You have to make up your own mind\\". That's really how I feel about \\"Matrix Revolutions\\". I really was disappointed with Matrix Revolutions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's just one of those things where you can't count on professional reviews, nor can you rely on our reviews. It's the type of movie you'll either love or hate, and it's up to you, the person reading this, to decide for yourself.<br />Everybody who likes this movie has their own reasons for liking it, and everyone who hates it has their reasons too; most are good reasons. Speaking for myself, I bet that I will like this movie a lot more on DVD. That was the way it was for Reloaded. I was disappointed in the theater, but quite satisfied by it at home and had much more fun with it. Don't ask why. <br />As for Revolutions, for me, it provided no real answers to the questions that Reloaded created. Call me silly, but at the end of Reloaded I thought that they were actually in a matrix within a matrix. They weren't really \\"free\\", they were plugged into a `special' matrix for people who begin to resist the `real' matrix, so they think they are fighting this war, only it's just another matrix, and the machines are going to wipe out Zion, basically emptying their recycle bin and start over, and they've done it five times already. That was the impression that \\"The Architect\\" gave me in Reloaded, and after Smith hopped into a human body, and Neo is using the force to stop sentinels it wasn't a far stretch to assume they were all still \\"plugged in\\" even though they thought they weren't. Where Neo's power comes from is a total mystery to me now.<br />A lot of the people who are confused by this finally, have been slammed by Pro-Revolutions reviewers here for being closed-minded. For me, confused is more the word to use, and good movies aren't supposed to confuse people. I mean if you want to provoke thought, that's one thing. But the only thought Revolutions provoked in me was how long and confusing the whole thing was. <br />There are computer dorks here too who simply think anyone who didn't \\"get it\\" was stupid. But that's the internet for you, isn't it? Then there are those who remind us that Reloaded and Revolutions are both the final chapter, and we're supposed to factor that in, and put the two movies together in our minds, and THEN it will make more sense. I watched Reloaded at home, about a30 minutes before leaving to see Revolutions, and it was no help at all. <br />I would like to see Revolutions again, so maybe I'll get what all the 5-star reviewers here got that I didn't. I tried so hard to like it; except the movie is so slow (The big battle was so big and long that after a time even that got boring). I don't think I can sit through it in a theater again, so I'll wait for the DVD, and remain optimistic that this will be a better movie for me at home than in the theaters. I bet that may be the case for a lot of us.<br />This review is probably no help to anyone. I really, really love the matrix concept. I think the first matrix was as far as they should have gone. THAT was thought provoking. \\"Revolutions\\" was fun. The effects were the best I've seen, but it's mired down by this convoluted plot that I can't figure out. Once again this does not make Matrix Revolutions a bad movie or unworthy of your time. That is for you, and you alone to decide for yourself.
B000000WJZ|5.0|For those of you that think that Nirvana is the greatest band of the 90s then you have never heard a smashing pumpkins cd.No doubt Nirvana was a good band but Kurt Cobain is one of the most overrated musicians in History and in my opinion the difinitive front man of the grunge era was Billy Corgan(though the pumpkins are definitly not grunge)Anyway bottom line this one of the greatest cds of the 90s.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I agree with some of the reviews already given: although this is cd is very different from mainstream, britney's ability to create such a unique album is awesome!  Although I am not a big fan of her two ballads in this album (I felt like she could have done better), the other 11 songs are sooooooo good.  Buy the cd today!  You definitely won't be dissapointed!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I Purchased this cd about 2 weeks ago and to be honest I thought it was going to sound rather dated being from 1980 but when I listened to it I was very wrong!My favorite tracks would probably be ashes to ashes and scream like a baby but every song is very well done.
B00005JLEU|5.0|We rented this movie from the library having no idea what it was about.  I was a little skeptical at first being that we are a Catholic Christian family and this was about &quot;spirits&quot;.  But the story whisked us away and before we knew it we were seeing life lessons of courage, dedication to family, and respect for people different from ourselves.  This is a wonderful movie that the whole family will enjoy and I can tell you, we enjoyed it about 12 times! LOL  Worth the buy, it will be in our stockings this Christmas!
B00009P1O0|5.0|I adored this one upon release on LP-and to this day still do-It is a great listen overall and a must have for any Neil Young fan-Walk On is a fantasic piece mostly in response to some Skynyrd comments off Sweet Home Alabama-holds up well thru the years..
B000000W8C|5.0|This album contains &quot;History&quot;, one of the finest indie anthems of the 90's.  For that reason only, it gets a 5 out of five from me!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Since the early days in 1999, Britney Spears has made a huge impact on pop culture. Her debut album did well and showcased her dancing abilities and her voice. Throughout the years, her records have improved, and she has had more say in which way her career would go. I believe that this record has given her almost a complete control over what she wants to do. This album is a solid dance-pop album with slight tinges of techno/hip-hop throughout the record. Her first single, \\"Me Against The Music\\" with Madonna showcases a new sound for Britney, but also is a safe haven to what she has released in the past. The second track, \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" with the Ying Yang Twins is a solid dance/hip-hop song. Maybe not the greatest song on the album, but it's all right. Track 4, \\"Breathe On Me\\", is a solid dance song that makes you immediately think of dance princess Kylie Minogue. Track 5, \\"Early Mornin'\\" is a great dance-pop song. It has a unique vibe to it - not like other songs by her. \\"Toxic\\" is an excellent song that is a more familar sound for Britney. Very fun song. \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" must be one of the best songs on IN THE ZONE. It is well written and has a good vibe. The entire album contains only two ballads, \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\", which are two of the best songs on the record. \\"Everytime\\" showcases Britney's vocal talent very well. Track 11, \\"Brave New Girl\\", is a fun song that has a techno/dance feel to it. Overall, I think Britney completed an excellent album that is necessary for every Britney fan to own. I promise you won't be disappointed. There has to be a song on the record that you'd like.
B0000004V2|5.0|Well, what can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?<BR>The first time I heard this album; within the first twenty seconds of the first track, I knew this was going to be something special, and I wasn't wrong.  Every track on this album is pop perfection; why can't music be like this anyomore?<br />If it wasn't for this album, there wouldn't have been oasis, ocean colour scene, the stereophonics, and just about every indie guitar band of the 90s!!!<br />Has any album been so significant and influential?  I doubt it, top marks from me!!!
B00002SSRZ|5.0|This isn't a review of Abraxas, if you need to see one of those, there are plenty of those around.  BTW, I think Abraxas on it's own is is four and one-half stars.<br />This is a review of the of Abraxas in DTS.  Sound is something that has always intrigued me.  In the early 1970's, stereo companies were experimenting with quadraphonic sound, with Columbia Records producing more than anyone else.  While the quad records had some walkover of sounds from one speaker to the other, the quad tapes had their sounds wonderfully separated.<br />Abraxas, with the chimes, swirls of sounds, and organs resonating at full-force was one of the best of the quad records.<br />When I saw Abraxas on DTS with 5:1 sound, I jumped at the opportunity to own it.  I have a 5:1 DTS Yamaha Stereo Receiver (5280) at home, but it is in my car (Acura TL with the ELS 5:1 DTS CD/DVD Player) that this CD really shines.  Whereas the sounds were somewhat separate on the record, they are distinctly separate on the DTS system: so crisp and so clear that you can close your eyes and envision yourself sitting in the midst of Santana playing around you.<br />If you truly enjoy the sound of music taken to the &quot;next level,&quot; get yourself a DTS system, and make Abraxas your first DTS CD.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002TQV|5.0|If there's one album you should buy from the 90's make it this one. It has everything: melancholy, pesamism, hope, love, glory, redemption.<BR>It has Fake Plastic Trees, High And Dry, Just, and of course Street Sprit.  Please buy this album!!!!!!!!!!
B0000683DH|5.0|This, to me, is the best of the Star Trek movies (old or new). This second version DVD (the first was skimpy with the extras) does a great job of showing its development from story to screen. Nicholas Meyer, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Harve Bennett all give their impressions of this film and its creation. The keep case is also excellent, since it's both sturdy and easy to place on my multimedia cabinet (pay attention, creators of the Battlestar Galactica and Total Recall special editions). Great movie, fantastic presentation of it.
B00005JM02|5.0|So many of the animated movies have a happy mushy, love story underneath (Shrek) that little kids don't really follow.  This movie is about an independent little fish, Nemo, who gets separated from his father.  No real love story there, except between a father and his son, and that is something that a 6 year old understands much better.<br />I agree with previous reviewers that this movie was geared more toward the younger ages, but that's not to say that older children or adults would not be entertained.  I'm not normally a big fan of Ellen Degeneres, but she was HILARIOUS as the voice of Dory.  My favorite scene was when Dory was \\"speaking whale.\\"  I was almost in tears because I was laughing so hard.<br />Very funny movie, and excellent animation.  A new family favorite, right up there with the Toy Story movies.
0767812646|5.0|This movie is unforgettable: My eyes were in torrential floods quite uncontrollably.  Mark Lester is beautiful, has a fantastic singing voice, and acts like a pro.  &quot;Where is Love?&quot; must be counted one of the greatest film songs of all time.<br />Since it is a film adaptation of a musical which in turn is based on the book, its storyline is not unexpectedly different from the book's.  <br />Finding Oliver! was one of MY greatest unexpected fortunes.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Very refreshing! Awesome from beginning to end. Just one question, When is the second season going to be released on DVD?<BR>PLEASE!!!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Their seems to be two types of people who review Kid A (and amnesiac for that matter). One side says they 'get it' and the other side says it sounds like a retarded monkey on a casio. To the people who dont like the sound, bad luck dont get worked up about it its not for everyone, for thoses who say you 'get' what radiohead are doing, you are all sheep. You dont 'get' what they are doing, probably they didnt 'get' what they were doing at the time! The only thing that matters with this album is what you interpret it as. To me this is a work of art because of the emotions it brings out, from fear to sadness to anger. Maybe i dont 'get it' but the music gets me.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|First of all, allow me to make myself clear: I'm not especially a DT fan, but I'm not dead-set against them, either (heck, I own all their CD's to date). I'm not going to add to the debate whether this is a DT album or not as, frankly, I don't much care. As long as it's good music, prog, straight rock, AOR, heavy metal, even classical, I'm all for it.<br />There lies the problem, though, because this album is a musical void.<br />And they're supposed to have done this in three weeks? Come on. What did they do on the last twenty days? This sounds more like an afternoon effort. Definitely a millionnaire CD, though. I mean, a new band committing this (yes, as in \\"commit a crime\\") wouldn't even find a label.<br />I already felt that DT weren't comfortable with metal, as The Glass Prison is in my opinion a dreadful song. Now, they've tried it on a whole album, which may have been a good choice as they hadn't really explored the genre yet. Problem is, they haven't got a clue.<br />Oh, sure, the album as a whole *sounds* heavy, but it's just noise, not music, I'm afraid. There's no feeling, no nothing. Just the \\"wall of sound\\" approach, as if to cover the fact that they're dead creatively speaking. Okay, so they're playing faster than they ever did before, so what? Bad news, guys, there are tons of guys out there who are playing faster than you do. And also better, thank God.<br />But then, what can you expect from a band which lost its collective soul on '94? Because, let's face it, what makes the big difference between prog and other kinds of rock is the keyboard. All the great prog groups, past and present, have been keyboard-fronted. DT was, too, until their best songwriter left. Rudess just doesn't make any impression. Maybe because the others don't let him, I don't know, but to me, he sounds like a session player added to the band as an afterthought. Don't get me wrong; there is a lot of keyboard here, but nothing special. Exception to the rule here is \\"Endless Sacrifice\\", where he lifts the song up some. But at 11 minutes plus, it's still three times too long compared with the ideas contained within.<br />Myung is there but does nothing special either, which is a shame (I edited that, as my earlier review was decidedly unfair to the guy--sorry, John). Portnoy is okay but unimaginative, and far from the drum-God lots of fans portray him as (in fact, there are quite a number of more accomplished stick-men out there). LaBrie's voice just isn't fit for metal and, as said before, Petrucci only plays faster than on earlier albums, definitely not better.<br />Also, these guys seem to have the impression that you have to write looooong songs to be labeled prog. Truth is, bands such as Marillion (Fish-era), Genesis (PG-era) or Arena, to name but a few, wrote quite a few excellent prog songs which were very short. On the other hand, Santa Esmeralda would never get called a prog group, but they have a few long songs to their repertoire (and, musically speaking, \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" is a much more creative song than DT has written in ages, IMHO). So, in my opinion, the length of the song has never been a factor, otherwise Mike Oldfield would be the king of prog (heck, \\"Amarok\\" is a single piece, an hour long), and he most definitely is not.<br />Bottom line: if you want heavy metal, listen to Maiden's \\"Dance of Death\\" of WASP' \\"The Crimson Idol\\", which is in my mind the best heavy metal release ever. If you think TOT is good, just listen to it and weep. But then, it was done in close to three *years*, and it shows. No fillers, there, just great songs from cover to cover. If you want prog, go buy \\"Legacy\\" or wait for Shadow Gallery's next release. And if you want something cross-genre, grab a copy of \\"Avantasia\\" or, better still, Nightwish's \\"Century Child\\".<br />Next time, guys, try to remember that, if less is more, in this case, more (ie speed) is definitely less (quality). And another thing: the best musicians are not thosewho play the fastest, but those who play together. Otherwise, it's no use being part of a band.<br />Oh, by the way--I must admit that you surprised me, as I was quite sure you couldn't go any lower than \\"6°\\". Shows how much I know, heh? But you know the worst of it? There *is* tremendous potential, here. So next time, please take the time to do a proper album, as a few jam sessions just aren't enough, even if your devoted fans keep telling you that even God isn't fit to play with you (\\"One and a half month to write songs is beyond stupid, it's insane.\\" -- Tom Englund, Evergrey -- guess what he would think about three weeks?)<br />Talking about the fans, the hateful attitude of some is, I feel, the most embarrassing, here. Just because someone doesn't like TOT makes him/her a moron? Come on, guys, show a few brain cells from time to time. If I name a CD that I like and you don't, does that make you morons, too? Of course not. You love TOT? Good for you. I respect that, although I don't personally. So please respect the fact than other people may have different tastes (and, no, I'm not pining for I&W 2). Thank you.<br />And even if you think this is a scorcher, just thought what they could have accomplished had they taken the time to work properly at this. Every way you look at it, making an album in three weeks is a bad thing... and admitting it is stupid. Because the guys who like it may be disappointed that you didn't take the time to polish it and those who don't won't like being taken for fools.<br />Worst of it is, I really wanted to love this album after being disappointed in 6°. Oh well, maybe next time...

B000000645|4.0|La idea de un do folk sicdelico slo pudo haber sido concebida (y exitosa) en la experimental segunda mitad de los 60. La propuesta de Heron y Williamson parece haber sido: &quot;hagamos las canciones ms extraas posibles, agregemos la mayor cantidad de instrumentos posibles, con letras lo ms bizarras posibles y veamos que pasa&quot;. An para los estndares de la sicodelia de la poca ste es un disco difcil de digerir, sin toques comerciales, donde las melodas se desdibujan rpidamente en medio de un bormardeo de instrumentos exticos y voces montonas. Definitivamente excesivo pero al mismo tiempo una experiencia fascinante para quienes quieren ir un poco ms all de los tipicos ejercicios pop sicodlicos ingleses o las interminables improvisaciones del otro lado del Atlntico. Dentro del alocado ambiente del disco los mejores pasajes se consiguen cuando el do (acompaado por algunos amigos) aplica mayor densidad instrumental y vocal, como ocurre en Waltz Of The New Moon con un notable uso del clavecn o en Three Is A Green Crown, un hipntico tema de casi 8 minutos que parece transportarte a la misma India, dejando a Beatles, Stones y muchos otros mal parados en este tipo de experimentos. No todo funciona en los 49 minutos, hay temas como A Very Celular Song que consiguen su objetivo de crear atmsferas pero se requiere ms que eso. Nightfall parece cerrar el disco con una nota melanclica dentro del caos generalizado, una buena despedida despes de un alucingeno viaje al lado ms extravagante de la sicodelia.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Many people out there would have you believe Sabotage is a terrible album, which is a perspective I find vexing, as it is a very strong and ambitious outing by Black Sabbath. <br />Nearly every song here is a strength, but there's 3 bonafide Sabbath classics, those being the high-energy opener Hole in the Sky, the album centrepiece Symptom of the Universe, and the self-absorbed bleakness of Megalomania. Thrill of it All is Sabbath rockin' like they should be, the Writ is another Multi-part epic. The rest of the tracks in the album are examples of when Sabbath's skills begin to falter. Don't Start (Too Late) is a really short acoustic guitar track, but the reason this album doesn't get the full 5 stars is because of the oddity that is Supertzar and Am I Going Insane [Radio Edit], which, although not bad tracks, just don't sound like sabbath. <br />Overall and on its own, this album is a true Sabbath classic, and although they certainly had better albums, it'll please fans of Sabbath, Ozzy, and tr00 Metal a great deal.
B000005QH3|5.0|How much has THIS movie affected my life?  Too much, I'm afraid... ;)<br />After over thirty years of it's release...I FINALLY had the opportunity to acquire and reproduce a 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T to the specs of this great movie!  And you can bet it was something I have been wanting to do for every bit of those 32 years prior!<br />Although the angelic white Challenger is frequently the &quot;star&quot; of this release, the main character Barry Newman (Kowalski) is equally, and likely more so.<br />Those who find this movie to be short on subject/plot (aside from the fantastic car chases, etc.), usually fail to realize that this flick is a true &quot;character study&quot; of a very deep personality in Kowalski.<br />This movie is a must buy, must rent for those who like great cars, deep subject lines, and amazing action.<br />Oh yes, you can see my V.P. Challenger replication (and some movie still photos) at:<br />[...]
B000002H6C|5.0|Undoubtedly the most sophisticated album in their career, the long compositions of ...And Justice for All, along with Metallica's best lyrics yet, make the album far superior to anything released by metallica, except maybe Master of Puppets. The lyrics, as the title and the cover would have you believe, deal with corruption and society's rapid decay. Only 2 song are under 6 minutes long, making it their most ambitous work. They also seem to try [amnd succeed with] every trick they can, including odd time signatures, harmonized leads, and extra sections. As far as the songs go, there are at least 4 tracks that are nothing short of astounding, these being Blackened, the title track, one, and To live is To die. Every other song is at the very least excellent, displaying barely any weak points. Reccomdended to any fan of thrash or progressive metal.
0553275976|5.0|On the surface, the book is a satire of the puffed up 80s.  The &quot;Vanities&quot; that are being blown up are all the pretensions that people put around themselves.  Sherman McCoy is a man who would've exuded strength and power in a prior age.  But is he a &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; bond trader (a term coined by Tom Wolfe, later to make it into the popular lexicon) or just another fluffed up product of society?  Indeed, the book explores this question.  You'll be surprised by the answer!<br />Is it just a novel of the 80s?  I disagree, for several reasons...<BR>- The greed of the 80s reappeared in the past 5 years.<BR>- If you look hard enough, one of the characters in the book is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.<BR>- The deep characters Wolfe creates ring true today.<BR>- New York again sees itself in a time of great change.  Maybe there are lessons in this literature?<br />Is it the Great American Novel?  Who knows...  But it can be read with &quot;A Man in Full&quot; to understand grit, determination and what does make America different.
B00004TH7Z|1.0|Brave New World: the upsetting first release of 21st century Maiden which follows the same pattern, track after track, and simply does not rip. As the title of this review implies, the idea was, after having played the chorus a lot, and taking the music slightly elsewhere, to come off strong with another one of those choruses and drag it to the end of the song, which is the case with 99.9% of the record, and this makes the album suffer from too much repetition, and the songs are too dependent simply on the choruses. Most songs on this release are extremely \\"let's sit around in this studio for and hour or two and see what we come up with\\" sort of songs. The songs worth noting are \\"the Wicker Man,\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" I'll take this over Styx's \\"Brave New World,\\" but come on... this was way too contrived!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|The release of this album could have been a great chance to hear the songs on the original without all of the extra stuff that Phil Spector added to it in 1970. Unfortunately, with no real involvement from the surviving Beatles, Let It Be...Naked is nothing more than a revisionist's version of what Let It Be might have sounded like had it been recorded in the present day.<br />While this new version is sonically very good, all of the atmosphere of the original has been lost. All snippets of Beatle chatter have been excised, for one thing, resulting in a couple of very awkward fade-outs. And practically all evidence of what used to be referred to as &quot;echo&quot; have been excised as well, resulting in a very dull-sounding (albeit crystal clear) mix.<br />For most people, the chance to hear &quot;The long and winding road&quot; without all the schlocky strings was probably the biggest motivator behind the purchase of this album. Unfortunately, a different take was used, and it isn't a better take. Moreover, McCartney's piano is too intrusive. (The version on Wings Over America is better...)<br />On &quot;I've got a feeling&quot;, Lennon and McCartney's voices are mixed to the center, rather than to opposite channels, diminishing the effect of the counterpoint later in the song.<br />And, I'm sorry, but Phil Spector's production of &quot;Across the universe&quot; is miles better than the one on offer here. Without the backing vocals, the recording sounds pretty much like the throwaway track it originally was.<br />The bonus disc is a well-intentioned effort to make up for some of the lost atmosphere of the original, but it is ultimately an unsuccessful one. Something closer to the Get Back album that was originally intended would have been better...
B00005JKZV|5.0|The sequal is finnaly here. I was amazed how good the first film was. I have read the books Faramirs relation to the book is poor. The battle of the Hornberg was great and is the most spectacular battle you'll see on screen. There are many victorys, losses and as well as ninja action theres quite a lot of humour with smeagol and gimli. 10/10
0739307312|5.0|Wow! This is an absolutely breathtaking book. I read it in just ONE sitting the other night. I could not put it down! I was ignorant about Da Vinci's symbolism and &quot;inside jokes&quot; as well as those of Boticelli and other masters whom Brown mentions. But after reading this book, I am planning on delving further into these issues! And that's saying something, because I am the least religious person you'll ever meet.<br />Dan Brown has an incredible gift for storytelling as well as an impressive handle on the facts. That's what makes this book so compelling: the story itself is fictional, but the foundation of it (the symbols, stories, and organizations) is real and historically accurate and well researched.<br />Just because this book deals with religious symbols, please do NOT be turned away if you are not religious. It's not preachy or heavy or any of that other nonsense. Believe me. It's fused with mystery, suspense, and historical facts.<br />(The epilogue will make you smack your forehead and say &quot;of course! It's so obvious!&quot;)
B0000DD7LB|1.0|britney new album is a new definition of the word sucks how can this artis keep on saling is beyond me. the &quot;new&quot; trip hop sound has the worst beat of all time. why do people keep on buying cd's with talendless singers who don't know anything about music in the first place.buy the beatles album or any other rock band like the white stripes &quot;elephant&quot; or coldplay live 2003 or u2  if you want to hear real music.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Man, is this a poor showing by some snotty poseurs from the bowels of the Upper East Side.  Is this what rock has sunk to?  The singer's lousy, and the playing reminds me of the kind of stuff that was slapped together for battle of the bands night back in high school.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|The classic to end all classics:  Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks classic &quot;Scarface&quot;.  This movie is loud, brash, over-the-top, relentlessly macho, and filled to the brim with testosterone--and no fewer than 206 F-words--courtesy of De Palma's direction, Oliver Stone's screenplay and Al Pacino's ferocious performance as the exiled Cuban yayo dealer Tony Montana.<br />The &quot;Scarface&quot; story is well known:  the rags-to-riches, exhilirating highs and mind-numbing lows of Tony Montana--a Cuban criminal who is exiled along with 25,000 others by Fidel Castro in 1980.  Tony begins as yet another poverty-stricken refugee in a Miami camp (albeit an extraordinarily ambitious one).  Soon, though, through a little luck and plenty of sheer ruthlessness he rises astronomically to the top of slimy, bloody Miami cocaine heap in a very short time with the help of his loyal, but none-too-bright friend Manny (Stephen Bauer) and woos the girlfriend (Michelle Pfeiffer) of his &quot;soft&quot; coke-dealing boss (Robert Loggia).  However, his ruthlessness and inability to trust anyone--which helped him rise to the top--threaten to become his downfall in the end.<br />So, what are this movie's strengths?  The direction, the eminently quotable screenplay (which has inspired countless rappers and stand-up comedians to this day), and Al Pacino's over-the-top performance quipped with a hilarious attempt at a Cuban accent.  There's good reason this film became the cult classic that it is today.<br />What are the weaknesses?  Well, it's THREE HOURS LONG, for one.  &quot;Scarface&quot; definitely starts to lose steam during its last hour.  Secondly, the music is UNBELIEVEABLY cheesy.  The music (and the fashion too) is aggressively, in-your-face 1983.  No doubt about it.  It's like the composer was aspiring to imitate Frank Stallone, rather than Nino Rota (composer of &quot;The Godfather&quot;).  <br />The DVD extras are great, detailing the film's making,its initial reception, and its enormous influence on hip-hop.  Noteworthy are the numerous interviews of rappers professing their love of the film, an interview with Oliver Stone who candidly explains how his addiction to cocaine forced him to move to France(!), plus the hilarious censorship placed on this notoriously profanity-laden film when it first got shown on network television (please see the above title).  <br />Twenty years later, &quot;Scarface&quot; has taken its rightful place along the great American gangster films of all time.  It may not be as good as &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but it's certainly more fun!

0345457684|5.0|Takeshi Kovacs, a native of Harlan's World and an ex-member of the thoroughly lethal UN Envoys, has inhabited many bodies in his career, both male and female, both natural and enhanced or even synthetic. That's the way life is lived in the 25th century. This ability to transfer personality and memories from one &quot;sleeve&quot; to another on demand also means it's seldom necessary to experience Real Death -- if you can afford it. It also means that the need for societal punishment usually results in having your cortical stack put on ice for a few decades, or even centuries -- and you might not get your own body back when you're released. Kovacs, though, is not typical, not even for an Envoy, and when he (or his consciousness) is needlecast across 180 light years to Earth by the excessively wealthy Laurens Bancroft to be offered a job investigating Bancroft's murder, he finds he can't refuse. The investigation gets him involved with all levels of Earth's society and with a wide variety of very artfully drawn characters, and he soon finds himself caught up in a vast conspiracy that he has very little chance of surviving. Woven through the story is Quellist philosophy (&quot;Take it personally&quot;) and Kovacs's previous history and the ghosts that haunt him. This blend of noir detective thriller and uncommonly inventive cyberpunk is an astonishing piece of work for a first novel, and I expect Morgan to become well known in the sf community in a very short space of time.
B00003CXUM|4.0|Beautiful people, beautiful places and a great feel for Hong Kong in that era.
B000002GGW|3.0|Some people hate this CD for its dark mood and some people think it is fantastic.  I think if it fairly good, close to 4 stars.  It isn't their best album but it has some good parts.  And I don't think it is all that dark. Note that there is a &quot;remastered&quot; version of the CD.  I have the original, and I don't think there is anything wrong with the sound.<br />The 3, 4 and 5 track of this album is like an extended, 30 minute version of Fool's Overture.  It has the changing themes and the dialog by famous people (Ronald Reagan, George Bush and others).  It is another one of those Supertramp tracks that take you into a different world and when it is over your head is spinning and you try to come back to reality.<br />The album starts out with the 8 minute, bouncy Cannonball.  I can take or leave it.  Tracks 2 and 6 are completely forgettable.<br />This is the first album after Roger Hodgson left the group.  He put out a fairly good album at the same time called Eye of the Storm.  It is hard to say which is better.  In 1987, both Hodgson and Supertramp released horrible CD's of short tracks trying to capture the disco pop sound of the day.  Both disappeared for over 10 years after that.
B00008DDSC|5.0|People seem to be polarized over this film, but in the end it's a sweet love story. It's worth the time to see for yourself. I truly don't see how it's immoral, but maybe it's because my soul is bound for hell. <br />And yes, the acting is superb!

B0000CABBW|4.0|&quot;Whale Rider&quot; is a wonderful film about a young girl, Paikea, named for, according to the legend of her Maori people, rode a whale to New Zealand, and is the father of all Maoris. Paikea was meant to have a twin brother, who would have been the firstborn boy in the family, but he, along with Pai's mother, died seconds after he was born. Pai's father leaves the hospital, and his family, leaving her sympathetic grandmother, and her disappointed grandfather, the current chief of the tribe, to take care of her.<br />As Pai grows older, she becomes more and more interested in her roots, and believes that she is destined to become a leader. This becomes even more apparent to her when a visit from her father reveals that he is starting a new life and a new family in Germany. However Pai's grandfather, Koro, has very different plans in mind. Girls are not allowed to become Maori leaders. So he begins training young local boys to be cheifs, bringing an end to his family's reign as cheifs. But Pai continues to try and prove herself, ending with an amazing sequence that leaves you with the question &quot;How on earth did they do that?&quot;<br />Despite the plot, &quot;Whale Rider&quot; is not necessarily a girl power film. Nor is it just a coming-of-age film. It is a story about the conflict between old traditions and modern development, and finding a compromise in which the two can meet. The score is really haunting and beautiful, and the filmmaking is seamless. Even the story is well developed, and very believable. And, if you really want to know the answer to the question &quot;how on earth did they do that?&quot; there is a wonderful behind the scenes segment on the DVD that will surely answer all the questions you can pose, and more. This is absolutely a film that cannot be missed. It warms the cockles of your heart, and will leave you cheering your lungs out for its gutsy, spunky heroine.
B000069HJM|1.0|The first 7 tracks of this album are shockingly bad.  This is another case of a progressive rock band from the seventies trying to change its image to match the sound of the times.  Almost all progressive rock bands did it and almost all failed miserably.  <br />On this album, Supertramp tries to incorporate the disco, dance club sound of the mid eighties.  This is not the original disco sound of the late seventies/early eighties (Bee Gees, Donna Summer, etc.)  This is what the disco dance club evolved to, after mixing in punk, new wave and electronica.  All the songs are short, 4 minute pop tunes.  Some of the lyrics are embarrassingly bad pop, love song lyrics.<br />Some of the music reminds me of Grace Jones' dicso sound.  Other parts have that pop saxophone sound that was popular with the female led groups, such as Quarterflash.  In some places, they sound like Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  None of it is the Supertramp sound.  I always applaud groups for experimenting, trying something new or expanding the music. But, in this case, Supertramp is just copying others.<br />All isn't completely lost.  The last 2 tracks are pretty good and go back to the old Supertramp sound.  The last track, An Awful Thing To Waste, sounds like an updated improvement on the song Cannonball, from the previous album, Brother Where Are You Bound?<br />In 1984, Roger Hodgson left Supertramp.  He and Rick Davies were the composers and singers.  They needed each other.  Neither has the voice to carry an album by themselves.  They were very effective in trading off vocals.  They also needed each other to keep the song compositions in line.<br />In 1984, Hodgson released Eye of the Storm and Supertramp released Brother Where Are You Bound?  Both were fairly good albums, keeping with the Supertramp sound.  In 1987, Supertramp released this (Free As a Bird) and Hodgson released Hai Hai.  They were both collections of short songs trying to capatilize on the sounds of the times.  Both failed miserably and led to the disappearance of Hodgson and Supertramp for over 10 years.
B000065V41|5.0|there are certain movies that really make the holiday season; and this is one of them. Yeah i like the other 'traditional' christmas carols, but this one is light and for the most part up beat while mixing in the drama... and who doesn't love Micheal Caine? Come on it's Micheal Caine! and the muppets, ugh, makes me want to watch it.
0312319517|4.0|Cal Dexter started as a fascinating character.  He is a Vietnam hero, a lawyer but his major occupation is as an avenger of wrongs.  Other reviewers describe the story.  <br />My comments are that he seemed just a bit too hard to believe.  Also the 9/11 angle just was too far fetched.  <br />In summary the book was fun to read but thinking about it afterward it did not hang together.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I bought Britney's In The Zone the day (actually the morning) it came out and popped it into my CD player driving on the way to school.  At first, I was really surprised by the new CD, especially by such songs as track 2 &quot;Boom Boom&quot; featuring the Ying Yang Twins, because this sounded way more hip hop than any other Britney songs I've heard before.  Eventually, like a lot of CD's, the songs have grown on me- just because I've listened to them repeatedly.  There are only two songs that I really like to listen to, &quot;In The Zone&quot; and &quot;Early Mornin&quot;.  Other wise, this CD isn't anything that spectacular but is a definate change musically for Britney.
0375703861|4.0|White teeth is an excellent novel, mixing humor with a variety of underlying issues in society today.  In many ways it reminds me of works by Nick Hornby, but achieving significantly more depth. <br />I lived in London for several years and found the fears of both immigrant and native residents refreshingly realistic in the way they are portrayed in the book.  A cultural melting pot is often held up as the achievement of the modern age, where we trancend national and cultural boundaries.  But as Smith illustrates so well, it is not the intellectual escaping to the leafy suburbs who have to deal with the issues of living the ideal, but real people like Archie and Samad.<br />The book explores a great deal of heavy subject matter, but does so in a cloak of comic prose, which makes it no only palatable but hugely enjoyable.  <br />One reviewer gives this novel one star based on factual inaccuracies about India and Jamaica, he may well be right.  However I think he misses the point, this is a book about people and relationships not places.  The issues dealt with are very real for millions of people and the book is factual in it's account of how ordinary people struggle to deal with them as they go about their lives.<br />White Teeth has had a great deal of publicity and hype since it's publication.  Often this predjudices me against books or movies, but in this case I agree with the hype and can only recommend you read it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers Extended edition is to its theatrical version what the extended version of the Fellowship of the Ring is to its  abridged theatrical release. Without wanting to give anything away, all I can say is the human element that makes us care about the characters and elevates the story beyond mere action extravaganza is all here in the added 45 odd minutes of footage, balancing and smoothing out the film into a grander arc that is well worth the nearly 4 hours running time. For the purists I will add that while the extended version of the film does indeed still veer  off course from the book, Faramir's character is somewhat redeemed, as his underlying motives for taking the ringbearer off his path is better understood with the added footage, as is Aragorns Dunadean heritage made clear. Also, more time is spent with the Ents, which adds a nice contrast to the more frenetic pace of the concurrent storylines. All of the extras slow the pace of the film and makes the editing feel less choppy. This is indeed the film Jackson intended to make . It is film making on an epic  scale with an attention to detail that may be unrivaled in the history of film making. Hands down, the extended version is the only way to see this film, and that goes for the first installment as well.<br />The bonus features are rich and extensive, making the incredible effort it took to bring the trilogy to the screen more palpable, which in turn helps the viewer appreciate the true cinematic achievement of these films even more deeply.
0385504209|4.0|I found this book a real page-turner, complete with compelling characters and a plot that kept me turning the pages. I think I read it in about 3 sittings. The characters were good and the information about the Goddess, The Priory of Sion, Templars etc. certainly held my interest. The only down side was a sense of having read much of it before.
B000000993|5.0|Easily put into words, this album is their best. Opiate showed us what a tight band they were both live and in the studio, while introducing us to the anger and darkness. Aenima let us explore a new Tool. While it wasn't a bad album, it wasn't complete. Lateralus was a joke. The songs seemed to go on forever, not really acomplishing too much. <BR>Undertow is their masterpiece. Each song fits well with the other, all moving right into the next with no problems. Maynard's voice has never been better (4 Degrees is a good example of how great his voice is,) Adam Jones proves that he can play the guitar and make it sound perfect for any song (most notable is the little jam in Flood,) Danny is a power house on the drums, and Paul shows his talent on Bass, making this one hell of an album. The only real complaint I have is Disgustipated. While the song is very enjoyable (can you hear the shotgun and sledge hammers?) the ending is something I don't want to hear over and over. It just takes too long.<br />Songs you should check out: 4 Degrees, Crawl Away, Swamp Song, Flood.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|After the brilliance of &quot;The Matrix&quot; I was terribly disappointed with this lame cash-in.  Every part of this movie was poor - the acting is shameful, the directing and editing is very, very poor - I got so bored that I had to force myself to actually stay in the theatre, the plot was awful, and ruined the brilliance of the first film's storyline, and the action sequences and special effects have not moved on at all since 1999.<br />This movie just stinks basically - you sit there and can't wait for the ending to come, it just seems to drag on and on with loads of boring rubbish and shoddy effects shots.  It is so bad that I am not even going to rent the third film or see it at the movies - the film-makers and studio do not deserve it.<br />Compare this to the stunning brilliance of the Lord of the Rings movies and it looks even worse.  While Reloaded has the Burly Brawl, The Two Towers completely embarasses it with the Helms Deep battle sequence.  And while the much longer Two Towers flies through while you are watching it, Revolutions is almost painful to watch.  It would be more fun to rub your back over a giant cheese grater - and certainly less painful.<br />In short, don't buy this DVD, don't watch any of the films at the movies - simply purchase the original Matrix on DVD and be done with this shambling, steaming load of crap.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This CD is amazing just as any other Sarah Mclachlan CD!  Tracks 1 and 3 are the best on the CD, I think.  But you will not be dissapointed at all if you buy this CD.  It's nothing short of a complete masterpiece.

The Ying Yang twins are hillarious in this song and itz a great dancing song for clubs of all kind.<BR>#3. Showdown 4/5<BR>This is a strange, yet interesting song. Some will like this beat, some will not. It depends on your fav music style.<BR>#4.

Itz cute and fun to listen to.<BR>#12. Everytime 4.5/5<BR>A nice, yet sad ballad. Itz hard not to cry when hearing her singing about this type of topic *cough cough justin*<BR>#13. Me Against the Music REMIX 5/5<BR>Wonderful remix! They added a 'Southern Asian' feel to the song which makes the beat irrisistable! They did a great job at remixing this song!<br />I recommend this CD for people who love to dance to different styles of music!!! If you wish to buy it, go to Fred Meyer because I purchased mine for no more than $10! If you never liked Britney, you will change your mind once you listen to this album. :-)
0393057658|5.0|This is a very readable, witty book, which on the surface is about baseball, and the application of statistical analysis (sabremetrics) to the evaluating of players and strategies (knowledge of statistics is not necessary; he doesn't get into that:  it's all about people and ideas).  A basic knowledge of baseball is certainly useful, as Lewis drops the names of many players and mentions certain types of plays (i.e., hit and run, sacrifice bunt, etc.) without pausing to explain them, but also probably not essential.  The people, and the lively writing of Lewis, are at the center here.<br />Lewis nicely weaves together the personal stories of the A's general manager (GM), Billy Beane, other team execs and scouts, and the individual players who were often considered misfits by other teams for a very particular reason (a year or two too old, an odd pitching motion, etc.), but were considered bargains by the As.  He gives good detail for anyone who has ever wondered how teams decide who to draft, or how a general manager negotiates player deals with other GMs (and, like Red Auerbach was for the Celtics in the 60s, is so good at picking the pockets of other teams that after a while they are reticent to deal with him).  And it's very interesting how Beane, a promising high school player who could be a poster child for the failure of the old, scout-driven school, takes it upon himself to dismantle that establishment with sabremetrics.<br />At a deeper level, the book is about several other matters:<BR>- how does any organization evaluate and hire people?<BR>- how does a radically new way of approaching a business develop?<BR>- what -- and how long -- does it take for the new method to displace the previous way of doing things, and -- more importantly -- the people who do it that way?<br />In the case of baseball, the development of sabremetrics -- which developed the new strategic insights based on detailed analyses of baseball's mother lode of stats -- has been ongoing forabout 30 years.  And the success of the Oakland As -- consistently making the playoffs with a payroll one-third of the Yankees -- is its first major test, and victory.  (A few other teams, like the Red Sox, recently say they are heavily influenced by it, although paying huge dollars for 37-year-old veterans like Curt Schilling may not be the best proof.)  But at most clubs the old-timers who run the game still prefer to rely on their subjective judgments.<br />In other fields, such as high tech, the head-in-the-sand approach taken by most baseball people would lead to the death of the company.  And perhaps that is why some companies do die.  Certainly plenty of studies have shown that most companies make hiring decisions in ways that -- like most baseball teams -- are highly subjective.  And what other industry has the historical, objective stats on performance that baseball has to develop the strategies from?  Other than, perhaps, investment banking and direct marketing, maybe none.  So, few could duplicate the depth of analysis, but many could profit from the style of thinking involved.<br />In any case, a very enjoyable read -- I read it in a couple days over Thanksgiving -- and highly recommended.
6304109318|5.0|this was a different part for Julia Roberts, but I have to admit, she pulled it off!! I think she did great, this was a awsome movie. Dark, gothic, romantic, and all-around good movie. It was very entertaining. I highly enjoyed it, its a different kind of Dr.Jekel and Mr. Hyde movie, but a good one!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|As for the many people who've called this &quot;boring&quot;-- I don't think you're giving it a chance. Whilst it isn't as experimental or groundbreaking as Radiohead usually is (Yorke admittedly called it their &quot;shiny pop album&quot;) I find it to be just as exciting and quirky, possibly moreso, just in a more subtle way. And there is no lack of energy or passion here-- hell no. Can't argue with someone else's opinion but I felt the need to express the opposite side.<br />Ok-- thats enough--<br />peace out
B000002BE9|5.0|My God this CD is awesome, I mean literally awesome. I love the opening chords of &quot;Sleep To Dream&quot; (one of my favs), all the way to the quietness of &quot;Carrion&quot;. I love this album from head to toe, and it will remain one of my favorites. If you want the full experience, however, I recommend you see her live. Fiona is truly magnificent in concert, and I saw her in 97 promoting this album, and previewing tracks from &quot;When The Pawn...&quot; and it as worth every penny. My personal favorites on this album are 'Slow Like Honey&quot;, &quot;Never Is A Promise&quot;, &quot;Sleep To Dream&quot; and 'Pale September&quot;. Her music is timeless and her voice individual. I love the fact that she pays homage to the great Maya Angelou, and shows respect to the musicians who've paved the way for artists like her to shine through.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Yes, I am a Radiohead nut... *sigh*... but it's a recent obsession. I just picked up OK Computer this June, and it quickly became my favourite album, and I bought Amnesiac, The Bends, and Hail to the Thief during the course of the summer (and Kid A in September or October).<br />Amnesiac and The Bends, which I purchased simultaneously, took only about a week to grow on me (Amnesiac, predictably, took longer.) But after a bit I loved them both and said-- I have to buy the new one. I did, and through 5 songs or so, it proved quite disappointing. (&quot;They were always delightfully weird, now they're just weird.&quot;) I gave it a chance though, and it came around-- WAY around.<br />To people who have been saying that HTTT has been getting such praise just because it's Radiohead and Radiohead can't do any wrong, I will point out that this is my 2nd favourite Radiohead album, even better than The Bends and Kid A, though nothing tops OK Computer.<br />This album, which blends the sounds of Kid A/Amnesiac and The Bends quite nicely, is a good step back on track-- (IMO with all the great songs on Kid A and Amnesiac -- and I loved the avant-garde-ness -- there were too many not-so-good songs [e.g. You And Whose Army, both Morning Bell's, Kid A, Dollars and Cents] to qualify them as masterpieces.)<br />One thing I've noticed about HTTT is that while past Radiohead records have stuck to one theme or sound, this one tries to cover everything-- amazingly the plan works-- and as a result, sounds more like a collection of songs than a concept album.<br />And cover everything, they do-- the piano ballads (Sail to the Moon), techno oddities (Backdrifts, The Gloaming), piano-ballads morphed into techno oddities (Sit Down. Stand Up.), dirgy funeral moaning (We suck Young Blood), old-style guitar-bass-drums (There There, Go to Sleep, Scatterbrain), sublime acoustic ditties (I Will), piano-and-bass-funk (A Punchup at a Wedding), and just-plain-unclassifiable stuff (the spooky and sortof rocking Where I End and You Begin, the zany 3-songs-in-one 2+2=5, the manic synth-bass number Myxomatosis, and the amazing closer A Wolf at the Door, on which Yorke does something that resembles rapping-- yea you heard it.)<br />You will find little &quot;to hell with the music and lyrics&quot; crap that hurt the last 2 albums; here, with only a few exceptions, every song is innovative, unique, meaningful, and incredible. And the songs that aren't so great.. are still pretty good. And there's 14 songs so you'll find plenty of genius :)<br />HTTT contains 4 of what I consider the best songs ever, period, in Sit Down. Stand Up. (my all-time favourite), We suck Young Blood, Myxomatosis, and A Wolf at the Door.<BR>here I'll rate the songs for the heck of it:<BR>2+2=5 9/10<BR>Sit Down. Stand Up. 10/10<BR>Sail to the Moon 9/10<BR>Backdrifts 7.5/10<BR>Go to Sleep 8/10<BR>Where I End and You Begin 9/10<BR>We suck Young Blood 9.5/10<BR>The Gloaming 6/10<BR>There There 8.5/10<BR>I Will 8.5/10<BR>A Punch-up at a Wedding 9/10<br />Myxomatosis 9/10<BR>Scatterbrain 8.5/10<BR>A Wolf at the Door 9.5/10<br />As for who I'd recommend this album to-- if you're a casual fan, definitely go for it (if you're a huge fan, you probably already have it.) If you've heard There There or Go to Sleep on the radio, beware-- these 2 songs are probably the most traditional on the album, so if you can keep an open mind and appreciate a little bit of different music, I'd still say go for it. If you're new to Radiohead-- don't start here. Start at OK Computer :)
0385507755|5.0|This book is so deep and revealing. You feel what the author is writing. I am in awe of the spirit to live through the ordeals. Amazing book.

B000099T2L|2.0|I bought the cd base on &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, and like everyone else says, there are only about 5 songs that are okay. But Alicia Keys is back Dec. 2 with her new album, Thank God!!! Alicia will end all of this Beyonce madness...
B0000C6E4D|2.0|10 songs in six years?  Wow.  You would think that there might be a little more to write about with all the turmoil of 9/11, birth and death--there's little hints of this becoming a better record than it is.  Remember on FTE that little hidden track of &quot;Possession&quot; naked with only the piano and a little hand percussion-thingy?  Well, this record will make you beg for those days.  The vocals are almost completely hidden under layers of synth strings and outer space beepy sounds--and a host of other wasted effects that are a distraction designed to help convey a musical and lyrical depth that just aren't there.  If you had 20 songs left in you, and you picked these as the ten best, there are maybe 2 that really belong.  I should think you would throw all 20 tracks on there and let the fans decide.  I hope there aren't any more tracks left from these sessions and she just chucks whatever may be left and starts anew with maybe some different producer/songwriters.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Matrix Reloaded? Well about all that the reloading seems to involve here is introducing the audience to a couple of new characters, giving Neo some more powers, throwing in some kick-ass action scene, notes from philosphy 101, and have it all lined up for M.Revolutions. thats about all thats here folks. Its pretty obvious all the Wachowski's cared about was creating a enough special effects to wow people into theatres instead of actually taking this movie somewhere. But i'd watch it again cause it does make a good action movie.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Looking outside the huge snowstorm on November 29th, we finally decided to rent the complete first season DVD of SIX FEET UNDER! We were just &quot;glued&quot; on our sofa to watch the ENTIRE season in one day! We already love this serie &amp; actors &amp; want to see the season 2 and 3! I guess I'll get the satellite TV just to watch HBO for this serie &amp; The Sopranos! PLEASE! Release season two! I don't care to buy it in USA to have it earlier in Canada!
B00005V0X5|5.0|This was not only my first megadeth album, but my first real thrash album, sure i have old metallica albums but nothing as ferocious as this. so it took a bit of getting used to, after my first listen i knew i'd love it once it get used to it. so after about a week of listening, a whole new world opened up infront of me. i was in love with this cd. every song, with the exception of These Boots, was in my head all day at school. before i knew it i was bringing this into my guitar teacher for months getting him to show me how to play Rattle Head and Mechanix. the gutiar work is AMAZING, i haven't heard any other band's guitar playing move me so much, Dave Mustaine and Chris Poland, i don't know much about bass, but David Elefson's bass solo in Chosen Ones is nothing short of cool, i also know nothing about drums, but Gar Samuelson was a madman. I've read that alot of people don't like Dave's voice, and i don't know why, i love daves voice- i think it fits in perfect. Even today this album is insanely heavy. my favorite songs are Rattle Head, Chosen Ones, Looking Down The Cross (SPEAK NO EVAAAAAL!) and Mechanix, that's not to say that the others aren't slamming though. Warning, if you buy this you'll probably end up buying anythign and everything else Megadeth or Dave Mustaine has ever or will ever do. this album rocks, through and through, it's the Blizzard of Ozz of Thrash and just an amazing cd.
B0000E1WNV|3.0|This performance in Spain is further evidence of <BR>Springsteen and the E Street Band's incredible talent as musicians and great entertainers.<BR>Unfortunately, the sound mix was a big letdown. I mix sound for a living and for me this concert did not capture the power and soul of this fantastic band. The powerful drumming of Max Weinberg was lost somewhere in the back of the mix. The backround vocals were treated as if they were not important, also hardly audible. Even Bruce's lead vocal had very little presence.<BR>For a much more exciting and accurate mix listen to the &quot;Live in New York&quot; DVD. It is a much better representation of how this band should really sound.<BR>I don't think there is anything technically wrong with the sound on this disc, just some poor creative decisions during post production. I wonder if Bruce was as directly involved in this sound mix as he was in past recordings?
B0000C0FJB|1.0|To enjoy this album, you will ABSOLUTELY NEED a 31+ band EQ on your stereo.  It will sound HORRIBLE and very WASHED OUT on most \\"PC speakers\\" and in most standard car audio systems.<br />I'm assuming that Alex and their engineer Jimbo did the best they could with the live sound they had... but since Jimbo is credited with the recording part, it seems like he had significant hearing loss by the end of the tour.<br />It sounds like the whole thing was bootlegged from a little Panasonic cassette deck back in the 50th row at the concert.<br />TERRIBLE and not worthy of the \\"Anthem\\" label.  Even the FIRST RUSH ALBUM had better EQ!<br />Do yourself a favor.  Find someone with a great deck who's got a very good EQ and a CD recorder, and run each of the CD's through it to fix the EQ, then use your copied CD's for general playing.<br />Rush should definitely recall this album and replace our discs with better mixes.  Utterly disgusting.

B00005YW4H|1.0|Ok... I wrote one of these before, and I guess I want to explain my point.  <br />I think this could have been a really good CD if Norah had bothered to stretch her voice a little bit more and pick more exciting or even remotely interesting material.  From start to finish, you get the same chords, arrangements, and vocal emotion.  Even her upbeat moments are spent dragging her and her listeners down.  <br />Having said all that, I can move on to the music.  Don't know why is the absolute best track on the CD.  In listening to it, you get the gist of the CD from start to finish.  However, if you feel the need to listen to something else, Come Away with me is pretty pleasant as well.  <br />I cannot in good faith say anything else good about this really BORING disc.  How it won the grammys it did will always befuddle me, in much the same fashion as the ALICA KEYS is better than INDIA.ARIE debacle, but that's another issue entire.
B000024D4R|5.0|Eclipsed by Dark Side of the Moon this overlooked release by Pink Floyd is one of their best works!<br />The writing and the music are simply brilliant!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is a great Album. I was expecting far worse, and I was surprised. I had to listen to it for a few times before coming to really appreciate it. My favourite song is Face in the Sand, which is really melodic and has a great chorus, but I can see why the great majority of people prefer Paschendale - they are both the best things Maiden has put up on years. Brave New World was also very good, but I Think Dance of Death is better.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I own The Beatles box set, when I found out they were putting out Let It Be the way it was intended I had to pick it up, but seeing as how Let It Be was my least favorite Beatles album I wasn't expecting too much. I was wrong! Compare this album to the garbage Spector put togeather in the 70's for the original release and you can hear a world of difference. It's not just the new digital remastering (no more hiss and everything comes through crystal clear), it's the composition quality these songs had, songs like Two Of Us and One After 909 finally sound like Beatles songs (early Beatles as the band intended)<br />After listening to Let It Be... Naked and going back and listening to the previous released Let It Be, it's as if a a famous artist painted a picture and then a much less talented artist came in and painted over top of it, you'll never want to listen to the original again and you'll discover a few old songs you didn't care for you'll like quite a bit.
6301963717|5.0|Fargo, schmargo. This is the Coen brothers' movie that should've won an Oscar. It has everything that makes a movie a classic: a script so twisted and tight that it makes a pretzel look like a donut; pinpoint acting and editing; dark humor; and the classic Coen brothers look. <br />Byrne and Finney, as Tommy and Leo, have an acting chemistry that I haven't seen in years. But even the other characters have ties and/or hatreds that are so believeable that they're almost unbelieveable: Caspar and the Dane, the Dane vs. Tommy, Bernie vs. Tommy, etc. In fact, at times, it's the entire world vs. Tommy. (How many times does he get beaten anyway? I lost count.) And, of course, there's Verna who has just about everyone wrapped around her cigarette stained fingers. What a character.<br />My favorite scene? The amazing shoot-out to the tune of &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. It's a waltz with bullets. To me, this is where the Coen brothers hit their peak.
0385504209|1.0|After much hype and many people telling me what a deep and interesting book this is, I was ready for a wonderful read. Instead I found a silly mystery that could be solved by my cat, insipid and vapid chacter development and a title some editor came up with to sell the book. Don't even bother.
B00008FRMQ|5.0|What you have here is Elvis at the top of his game, both in song writing, and musically - making this release a classic and essential recording. Following on the heals of a smashing debut, this release proves that Elvis was no passing fad, but rather a powerhouse that would help shape the face of contemporary music!  He also helped revive songwriting which was mostly lacking at the time.

6305878323|4.0|Just a quick note here - if you are thinking of purchasing a copy of Mary Poppins now, just wait a little while.<br />Sometime in 2004, Disney will be doing a &quot;Special Edition&quot;, two disc DVD release that will be similar to thier recent reissue of Sleeping Beauty.<br />With all of the features on that, people who buy this DVD recently will be disappointed if they didn't wait.<br />Disney will be including all of the &quot;Making of&quot;, pre-production art, and other features that make their new &quot;Special Editions&quot; great, to the new edition of Pocahontas.<br />There are three other &quot;Special Editions&quot; due in 2004 - Alice In Wonderland, Lilo and Stitch, and Pocahontas. Alice will be the first released in 2004. Also, there's the &quot;Platinum&quot; edition of Aladdin in October 2004. Worth waiting for in my opinion. You have been warned. :-)
B00001OH7Y|5.0|WOW!!!  I am so glad I bought this album.  There are some gems on this album that should have been hits like &quot;Ashes to ashes.&quot;  I am talking about, mainly, &quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot; and &quot;Scream Like a Baby.&quot; The vocals and musical arrangements in these songs are brilliant, not to mention the EXCELLENT lyrics (read along, you'll see!). They are hauntingly harmonious, but tackle bittersweet issues.<br />I read somewhere that Bowie was into so many drugs while recording this album, that he doesn't remember recording it.  Whether that's true or not, doesn't matter.  You can tell that his voice is simply WILD (and passionate)with these songs which gives it a certain &quot;edge&quot; that no other Bowie album has. For example the way he SCREAMS during &quot;It's No Game (Part 1), not to mention the psycho sounding japanese women in the background! What a wild song!!<br />Bottom line, this is a TIE with &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (in my opinion) for the best Bowie album ever. A collection of amazing writing and instrumentation.  You'll be addicted to it.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|This DVD is titled as a concert in 2000. Is that a mistake? Since 9/11/01 occurred after year 2000, Springsteen had not written or performed most of the songs on the first disk. <br />A small detail but bothersome one. The DVD is okay, not as good as &quot;Live In NY&quot; and I wouldn't purchase it unless I did not have &quot;NY.&quot;

B000002KZA|4.0|This is the first really great Depeche album. It's probably also the biggest step forward taken in their career. Although some songs are better than others, there's not a dud on the album. It's also the first DM album to feature the exellent Alan Wilder. &quot;and Then..&quot; is a beautiful song and I really like, unlike most of these reviews, &quot;Pipeline&quot;. I don't think it's boring at all.
B00005JMFI|5.0|As soon as this is on DVD I am buying it.  It is a must have.  Will Ferrell outdoes himself with this movie. People actually clapped when the movie ended.  Poor Buddy- how he got his name is part of the fun - a misfit toy (so to speak) who finds his niche in the world.
B000002KDG|5.0|When first released on vinyl, Young treated fans to an acoustic/electric melding of haunting music, and some of his finest live work!<br />Taken as a whole, this is a daunting work that remains fresh and riveting!
B00005JMR5|5.0|Regardless of any opinion on the story or acting, both are irrellevant.  Two of the greatest artists of all time portray on screen exactly that.  The perfection of an art that started in France and Italy but was refined by Russia, BALLET- meets one of the few American born arts, TAP.  These two performers in Baryshnikov and the late Gregory Hines held me to complete admiration.  I wish the world was as passionate about life as these two amazing men are!  Watch the movie, I gaurantee you appreciate it!
1882723007|5.0|This book is great in uncovering possibilities, hope, and some reassurance that good is better than evil.  Very fantastic descriptions that seem sometimes hard to believe.  It is like the opposite of a horror book, by going into various abstractions of love, good feelings, and good deeds.  I like the fact that is has enraged some Pagans, or those who think they know about the afterlife.  This book can help you understand that the afterlife can be much more than anyone has anticipated.
B000002U82|5.0|The negative reviews on here (or at least the two most vitriolic ones) talk about how the songs on DSOTM are fodder for guitar solos, and how they have nothing &quot;special&quot; to distinguish between them.<br />I have to ask, are we listening to the same album? Because... there are only three guitar solos in Dark Side of the Moon.  Out of nine songs.  Not to mention the fact that the songs that do have guitar solos are not centered around those solos.  &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, and &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;, the three tunes WITH guitar solos, either have another instrumental solo accompanying the guitar, or lengthy intros and sound effect pastiches that balance it out.  The solo from &quot;Time&quot; for instance, illustrates a person's whole lifetime! It's a soundtrack to growing up, and the solo brings the drama!<br />Also, if you can't see what makes every track &quot;special&quot; and you think it's &quot;repetitive&quot;, I have to really wonder about your IQ.  Every track has funny little nuances, complex little things that make every single track worth relishing.  The whole album is not built around &quot;Time&quot;.  If anything, I would say the climax is &quot;Us and Them&quot;.  But that's not even the case; every song has a specific message and soundscape, and the variety is so endless one wonders how a group of 5 people (including Parsons) could have done something like this.  It is truly almost extraterrestrial in its majesty.<br />This is the greatest piece of music ever written, period, the end, and it will continue to resonate with everyone until the end of time.  Some people love to hate it, because some people are like that, but they know in their heart of hearts that they love it.  So buy it, buy this 93 Anniversary edition, and buy it now.  Listen to it anywhere; it's perfect for every situation from making out in the car to hanging out with your friends to listening alone in a darkened room.  Listen with an open mind, and don't hate it just to rebel.  Everyone has the right to enjoy this wonderful album, and we should all thank Roger, Dave, Rick, and Nick for imparting us with this piece of humanity, theirs and ours.<br />PS: Radiohead wouldn't know their asses from a hole in the wall if it wasn't for Pink Floyd.
B00005JMFI|2.0|Who would want to see a movie about a human elf? I guess a lot of people. But I didn't laugh once. But a packed crow in a theater did (minus me). This may be the type of movie, that you would laugh a lot in the theatres, but not laugh much at home. Let me start off by saying, that I don't see a lot of movies in the theatres, the last one before this was Finding Nemo. But I think the movie critics are hyporcites, and I think that is, because they liked this one, but give a lot of comedy movies like Scooby Doo and the Cat in the Hat bad reviews. When the movie opens, a human baby sneaks into Santa's bag at in orphange. He was born to parents, but his mother put in the orphange, and then died. The movie didn't explain what caused her death. At the North Pole, Santa discovers the baby, and decides to keep the baby. And is raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and is named Buddy. But the baby grows bigger than the other elves, and doesn't know that he is a human. Then Papa Elf tells Buddy (Will Ferrell), the truth, he was adopted, and his real father is Walter (Honeymoon in Vegas' James Caan). And that now a lot of kids are know not believing in Santa Clause, because it is thier parents who give them thier Christmas presents, all the years they have been the ones. Edward Asner plays Santa Clause, and then Buddy deicdes to leave the North Pole, and find his father, who works in the Empire State Copmany, and works for a book company. Walter doesn't know that he has another son, that is about 30 years old. He has a son about eight years old named Michael (Daniel Tay) an has since remarried, and is on the naughty list at the north pole. Kids might liked this movie, and then again, they won't like the talk about that kids don't believe in Santa, and it really thier parents who give htem Christmas presents. If you are going to take the kids to see a Christmas movie, this will be the one, since the other Christmas movie \\"Bad Santa\\" is a Christmas movie, but is rated R.
0156027321|4.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; brings together a swirl of beautiful turns-of-phrase with an eccentric tale about a 16 year-old Indian boy lost at sea for 7 months.  With him on the lifeboat: sparse water, a make-shift raft, and a 450 pound bengal tiger.  Pi, the main character, must tame the lion well enough to survive the sea.<br />Martel's writing style is at once whimsical and profound.  He claims that he has found a story that will make you believe in God (Pi is a Christian/Hindu/Muslim).  But the beauty is not the punchline, it's the process.  Martel sees &quot;riots of flowers,&quot; teachers who &quot;came into my dark head and lit a match,&quot; and neckies that are nooses, &quot;inverted though it is, it will hang a man nonetheless.&quot; Often you will stop the story to muse over the words.<br />The only downpoint of the book is that after about 100 pages of beautiful writing, it falls away for the real story of the lifeboat.  Interesting though it is, you will probably find yourself longing for the established style and wondering where it went.  Fortunately, the story will then carry you through to the end--a hilarious and profound explanation of the boat wreck to a couple of insurance agents.  Definitely worth reading.
B000002P2V|5.0|Although its original birth came from Pete Townshend's scrapped attempt to resurrect his ill-fated \\"Lifehouse\\" project, \\"Who Are You\\" pronounces the death of the entire idea of growing older with grace. Though the Who were still young when the album was released in 1978, the paranoid fear of a heyday coming to an end was intensified by the rapidly growing punk and disco movements, both of which were making it hard for bands like the Who to find their feet again. And the exhilirating material within \\"Who Are You\\" perfectly articulates the band's scorn and contempt.<br />From the clever cynical opener 'New Song,' Pete Townshend bashes the facelessness of pop music, as Roger Daltrey's throaty roar sarcastically describes the elements of \\"radio standards.\\" John Entwistle's rage filled 'Had Enough' is anthem-like, and his sci-fi tinged '905' unintentionally expresses creative frustration in the line \\"Every sentence in my head, someone else has said.\\" (The song was actually part of a bloated concept album idea the bassist had, but never used.) The angry but shapely in form 'Sister Disco' fits perfectly, while 'Music Must Change' and 'Guitar And Pen' express a feeling of lost youthful musical innocence and dreams. The suicidal 'Love Is Coming Down' is an interesting addition to Townshend's credits, but it is the ominous six-minute title track that captures the mood of the album best. It contains one of Daltrey's most fiery vocal performances, and the band's well-established love of studio technology. The song was written by Townshend after a real-life bad escapade after a night of drinking and less-than-casually meeting two members of the Sex Pistols.<br />Their last album with legendary drummer Keith Moon, who died after the album's release, \\"Who Are You\\" is one of the group's most angst-filled moments, remarkable because it was hatched at a time when all the angst was coming from the play-dirty punk bands that were rising to ever-increasing notoriety. It is the anthem of derision and rightfully bitter feelings of a band that found themselves out of place.ision and rightfully bitter feelings of a band that found themselves out of place.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a very original and disturbing movie. Movie's this great only come along once in a while, so if you have been putting it off rent it or buy it immediately. It's hard to really describe the movie, but Donnie questions whats real and also time travel in the movie. He also encounters a person dressed as a rabbit who tells him to do various things. This has became one of my favorite movies of all time, so give it a shot..<BR>Rated R for Strong language, Disturbing images, and brief violence
6305280762|4.0|Flush with the success of The Poseidon Adventure, Irwin Allen found his next disaster spectacle in this joint venture between two major movie studios.  Combining two projects into one, The Towering Inferno (a dual adaptation of the skyscraper fire thrillers The Tower and The Glass Inferno) is the disaster movie as epic adventure.  Featuring an all star cast, terrific special effects, and harrowing stunt work, the movie was a solid follow up to Allen's previous hit and it remains one the very best disaster movies of the seventies.  Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|5.0|I'm re-posting this review because many people do not understand. I've seen and read many negative reviews in the past done stating that Avril \\"is a poser,\\" or \\"she is a disgrace to all punk bands.\\" I'm just going to tell you, this is a CD, not a poster of Avril, which you may judge. Any Avril fans also know that she NEVER claimed to be punk (anybody who says that she is punk is wrong). It seems like everybody here is judging her looks and putting a stereotype on her, and not paying to close attention to the albums content. If you're going to give this CD a star, don't do it just because you hate her as a person, do it because you hate her MUSIC. There's a good chance that if you hate Avril as a person, then you are going to love this CD. If you are considering buying the CD, read my grades. I loved this CD. If you love Michelle Branch or Alanis Morrisette then you are going to love this CD!<br />1. \\"Losing Grip\\"- A+ [single]<BR>Good song, kind of pop, kind of rock. Really pop in the beginning, then turns to rock. About a breakup (like many of her other songs) and betrayal. It was also a single on the radio for a short amount of time. <br />2. \\"Complicated\\"- A+ [single]<BR>You've seen the music video, you've heard it on the radio, it's a single. Beautiful song. Enough said.<br />3. \\"Sk8er Boi\\"- A [single]<BR>A cute song. It's rock/pop song about a girl and boy that secretly both liked each other but the girl would never tell. It's also got a lesson to it. At the End, Avril sings about having a relationship with that boy.<br />4. \\"I'm With You\\"- B+ [single]<BR>This is a nice, winter-y song, that would be beautiful if Avril worked on it just a little more. It's got a nice violin when it's played, but towards the end Avril sounds like she's getting out of tune or possibly shouting.<br />5. \\"Mobile\\"- A<BR>Awesome song, awesome guitars. It's about moving away and leaving everything behind, and about changing. A song almost everybody can relate to if they ever moved before.<br />6. \\"Unwanted\\"- B<BR>Good the first few times, but definitely not her best. Like \\"Losing Grip\\" its kind of about betrayal, but its guitars are much harder, and the lyrics are not her best, and are a little on the strange side. <br />7. \\"Tomorrow\\"- B+<BR>Not the best song either, unless you're in a bad mood, because this song is just slow. Just like \\"Mobile,\\" it's about changing (sorta) and carries the \\"I'm not ready\\" message. The only instrument really played is the guitar in this song.<br />8. \\"Anything But Ordinary\\"- A+<BR>A very nice song, that's about being weird (and maybe just not fitting in). The lyrics are a little strange, but the song overall is very cute. It's kind of like Michelle Branch's \\"You Get Me.\\" One of my favorites on the CD. <BR> <BR>9. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\"- A+<BR>Cute song, with nice guitars in the beginning. Sure, it's a little juvenile, but I admire her way of writing this one. Anybody who has a crush can relate to this one!    <BR>  <BR>10. \\"My World\\"- B<BR>This song is about Avril and her growing up, but I really think she doesn't need this song tacked onto this CD. Not the best song on the CD, it doesn't reflect her talent.<br />11. \\"Nobody's Fool (If)\\"- A+<BR>This is a fun, half rap, half pop/rock song. Nice guitars in the beginning, and Avril does a good job with the rapping. I usually hate rap, but when Avril does it, it's good! It's about somebody trying to turn her into somebody else. You need to \\"step up\\" and sing this one!<br />12. \\"Too Much To Ask\\"- B-<BR>Not the best song on the CD, either. It's probably the worst song on the CD. The lyrics aren't the best, either... it could use some work, and her voice isn't her best. It's another song that's about not being true to yourself.    <br />13. \\"Naked\\"- A<BR>This is one of Avril's more romance-like songs. It's about ... yeah, you know. :P It's kind of pop, though- but it is a song about a deep relationship!   <BR>               <BR>OVERALL GRADE: 94/100 --A<br />Enjoy! And remember to check for Avril Lavigne's 2nd album (she promises it will be more `rock-ish'), coming late this year or early 2004! ;)
B000002V1D|5.0|this is a great album for not only the die hard duranie, but for anyone who likes techno, rap, or old school dance music.  i think all the songs are different &amp; show a much more mature side of the band. one of my favorite all time albums &amp; would make a super addition to anyone's collection.  good for that macho guy who wants desperately to own a duran duran album, but is shy of being labeled.  don't worry, even cool people love this album!
0790733226|2.0|I like Jodie Foster.  She's a terrific actress if given the right script (Silence of the Lambs springs to mind).  But, like any other human being, she isn't perfect.  Contact, apparently her creative child, ought to pop whatever &quot;genius balloon&quot; the folks in Hollywood have tried to pin on her sleeve.  This movie is slow, overbearing, and not very interesting--quite an accomplishment for a movie involving inter-stellar travel and first contact with intelligent life outside of Earth.  All in all, Foster holds her own compared to the insufferable performance from Matthew McConaughey.  Simply put, he is awful, attempting to portray an intelligent representative of the religious point of view.  He simply isn't up to that task, and comes across as more of a dumb hick way out of his element.  (Has he ever been good in anything?  Not that I've seen.)<br />So Contact just drags on and on, preaching this, prattling on about that, spoon-feeding us the life story of this preeminent scientist (Foster), showing us stereotypical intrigue between those who want scientific progress and those who do not.  Added for good measure are some sophmoric attempts to engage in philosophizing about &quot;big&quot; issues (which end up being just plain dumb) and an ending that simply isn't worth the wait.  The long, long wait as Contact crawls to its anti-climactic conclusion.
B00000099Y|5.0|In a short review of this masterpiece I would have to say that this is one of those rare moments in music where a band comes together and delivers a near perfect performance. The lyrics or this release are some of Tool's best and are equally thought provocing and amuzing. Eulogy may be one of the best songs ever recorded a rare mix of progressive rock in a darker and complex mood. This is a rare CD that lakes even a moment of weakness. A must buy.
B000060P79|2.0|Just for you to know: I already know what's going to happen. As soon as the Simple Plan fans come and see this negative review on this site, they're going to press \\"Not Helpful\\" so this review becomes one of the less popular, just because they don't like that other people's opinions don't match their own. So please don't press \\"Not Helpful\\" unless you honestly haven't bought the CD and it really isn't helpful to you. Keep in mind people, be honest whether the reviews are helpful to you or not helpful, as it's being helpful to the person who wrote it.   <br />Now onto the CD: I bought this CD a month ago because one of my friends said that it was awesome \\"punk rock\\" and since I liked Avril Lavigne I should listen to this. I don't know what this is, but it isn't punk or rock. It's pop/rock. They're tying to pull this Smashmouth + Good Charlotte thing which isn't working. <br />There's only THREE songs that I could listen to over and over again, and that's \\"Addicted\\" and \\"God Must Hate Me\\" and \\"My Christmas List.\\" Most of these songs on the CD are whiny about not wanting to grow up (i.e. \\"Grow Up\\", \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" and \\"Perfect\\"). The song \\"Perfect\\" is irritating to me because it's whiny and annoying, and what is this thing that \\"Daddy I can't be perfect!\\"? Like the anonymous reviewer said they are 25-ish and singing about being 'kids.'  <br />The other problem with this CD is more than one song carries the message of \\"life sucks\\" (i.e. see lyrics for \\"God Must Hate Me\\", \\"The Worst Day Ever\\" and some of \\"Perfect\\"). If you like a boring CD with every track repetitive of one another, then this is for you.  <br />And the rest of the CD? It's filler. Some of the songs' lyrics sound like they rushed through to get their CD done and released. If you really want to know the 'grades' for this, look below:<br />1. I'd do Anything -- 9/10<BR>2. Worst Day Ever -- 5/10<BR>3. You Don't Mean Anything --4/10<BR>4. I'm Just A Kid -- 4/10<BR>5. When I'm With You --3/10<BR>6. Meet You There -- 3/10<BR>7. Addicted -- 9/10<BR>8. Alien -- 1/10<BR>9. God Must Hate Me -- 10/10<BR>10. I Won't Be There -- 3/10<BR>11. One Day -- 2/10<BR>12. Perfect -- 4.5/10<BR>13. Grow Up -- 1/10 *YAWN* Don't we get the idea now that you're 'kids'?<BR>13½. [Hidden Track] My Christmas List -- 9/10  <br />I'm a teen and I don't find most of this very interesting. I don't why teens or anybody finds thing great music to listen to; it's just another CD that the media is throwing in your face. Maybe if the media gives us some good music to listen to we will buy CDs that cost...dollars, rather than downloading it.
B0000B3B95|4.0|There was plenty of criticism about this film.  However I thoroughly was entertained by it.  I thought it did drag until the Hulk's first appearance which isn't until about 45 minutes into the film.  After that it is very good in my opinion.  The dog fight scene was tremendous...watching the hulk jump from mountains to bridges to canyons was very cool...although the animation wasn't given great reviews I thought they did a tremendous job making the Hulk seem lifelike.  Isn't it great to see a giant Hulk breaking the front of a tank in half.:)  The ending was kind of wierd and definitly leaves room for a sequel but nevertheless I think the effects will keep you wanting to watch this movie more then the story.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Considering what is passed off as music these days. . . . Beleive me, this is a welcomed breath of fresh air.    [...]The music in \\"Let it Be. . . Naked\\" has been available to Beatles fans through bootleg recordings for many years. The sound quality in a few of these bootleg editions is quite good. But, in others. . . well, you know. . . . \\"caveat emptor,\\" especially when it comes to underground music recordings.   This recording, however, gives the listener a fresh perspective on the \\"Get Back\\" sessions. For openers, the tapes have been remastered and cleaned, providing excellent sound quality. Although Beatles fans are familiar with the songs on this CD, the warmth and freshness of an \\"un-spector-ized\\" recording session is felt throughout the CD. This is the way the Beatles wanted \\"Let It Be\\" to be released in the first place -- Gone are the Phil Spector orchestra and choral affects and the interlude pieces -- \\"Maggae Mae\\" and \\"Dig It.\\" Instead, an outstanding uptempo version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" has been added. The studio banter heard on the original \\"Let It Be\\" LP has also been eliminated, except for John Lennon's famous: \\"I hope we passed the audition\\" at the end of the CD.   Make no mistake about it, the original \\"Let It Be\\" is a classic.  Considering what was happening with the Beatles and Apple LTD at the time, Phil Spector did the best he could with what he had to work with -- raw tapes and little, if any,  guidance or direction from any of the Beatles.  John worked closest to Spector.  But, once again, keep in mind that in the 1970's the Beatles were more busy recording solo efforts and making court appearances to settle questions about tax liabilities, management, and other business matters that they, initially, did not have to worry about -- thanks to Brian Epstein.      I do not believe that this is Sir Paul McCartney's attempt to rewrite the Beatles' Legacy. Ringo Starr and George Harrison (to a degree) agreed on this project. Yoko Ono also agreed with this project. As a matter of fact, Ringo Starr give this release a powerful endorsement prior to its release. McCartney may have a big ego. But, that is not the case with this recording. This is, simply, releasing \\"Let It Be\\" the way the Beatles had intended it to be released in the first place.   I agree with a lot of other reviewers in that some of the studio banter should have remained on the disc and perhaps the full-blown version of \\"Dig It\\" would have been a welcomed addition -- considering that the recording industry is no longer hampered by keeping recorded music to under 45 minutes (like it was during the heyday of the 33-1/3 LP). Personally, I would have preferred the \\"Red Apple\\" Label on the CD along with the original cover of the \\"Get Back\\" / \\"Let It Be\\" LP. As you recall, prior to the familiar LP cover to \\"Let It Be,\\" the original cover concept was similar to the \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" Beatles Collection LPs that were released after the Beatles disbanded. I believe that this would have made a better cover than the \\"film roll.\\"   Overall, in my opinion, this is a good CD that die-hard and casual Beatles fans can appreciate. And, Yes, the band has passed the audition. . . . . Again!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I have read many of the reviews on the newest DT release TOT.<BR>I believe it is not worthy of the praise that some are giving it and equally this CD does not deserve some of the harsh criticism it has received. This CD should not be compared to nu-metal, while parts of This Dying Soul do sound that way the CD and music as a whole possesses more complexity than a typical nu-metal band. Also nu-metal bands do not usually possess guitar solos in thier songs, Petrucci does play many solos on this CD, the only problem is I believe Petrucci's work on this CD to be not quite as interesting as his previous songs and solos. This CD has nothing like the solos to &quot;under a glass moon&quot; or the beginning's of Universal Mind from LTE. Maybe it's time DT incorporate some new sounds or instruments into their music.<BR>The CD as a whole I believe lacks some of the special song depth and mood of previous DT releases. This CD at times becomes rather simple, and has nothing that grabs your attention, the riffs at times are rather straight forward and overly repetative.<BR>The problem for me is nothing on this CD grabs me like Metropolis, or a Change of Seasons did. On the upside this CD as compared to current mainstream music is a gem. I was impressed with Labrie's vocal performance. I believe the Vocals to be one of the strongest parts of this release. Portnoys drumming is respectable along with Myungs and Jordans performance, the only problem is I can't find much in this CD that is different or more special than their previous performances. I do also think the distortion Petrucci is using is maybe a tad to thick and heavy for Dream Theater style. Lyrically I find the CD to be weaker than previous releases, the theological overtones are a bit lacking in depth. Although the lyrics to In the Name of God are not that bad. Lyrically I think there is room for improvement, I hope for the next DT release to be a little stronger in the lyrics, hopefully something more like Leftoverture by Kansas. After many times of listening to TOT I would rank it in this order as compared to other DT releases.<BR>1. Images and Words   2. MII: Scenes from a memory 3. Awake 4. Change of Seasons 5. Falling Into Infinity 6. 6DOIT 7. Train of Thought<BR>8. WDADU<BR>In conclusion this is a very good CD and worth buying, but lacks that extra special something of earlier DT releases, yet still I look forward to seeing them live this January, and hope for a stronger performance on their next release.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Wow, OK I'll be the first to admit that I liked the song Baby One More Time, it was catchy, and it was before Britney Spears became Britney Spears(tm). I knew she couldn't sing but at least the songs were somewhat upbeat, something you could listen to without having to think, which is good sometimes. Now this CD is released, and I'm not even sure there's singing on it. They pump the music up so loud to cover her inferior voice, they modulate her voice electronically to make her sound more &quot;adult&quot;, and then her panting to really make the 14 year old boys crazy. This CD will be a huge seller I'm first and she'll probably go on to slaughter a couple more records before we can finally start talking about her in the terms we should be: a Tiffany-clone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I didn't buy this cd until maybe 6 months or so after it was released because i wasn't a fan of Dirrty (at first) and although was a past fan of her, wasn't sure if i wanted this since I fealt she had become a different person. I eventually convinced myself to buy it after deciding that since I had bought Britney's second album, that I should buy her's lol. Am I glad that I did! Listening to it for the first time may not make you love the cd, but after about the third time listening you catch on to the songs and really start to appreciate it. There's only one song on this cd that i don't really like (make over) but other than that I love them all (Walk Away is my favorite!!)! I can say in all honesty that this is the BEST album I have EVER owned and am still listening to it after about 6 months of owning it! Seriously I still listen to it everyday! I even love Dirrty now as well! Not only are these great songs but the lyrics are awsome and Christina is just an incredible song writer! Don't look at her past pop-princess image as a reason for not buying this cd because back then she was merely a product of a record company; now she has truely shown through and given you your money's worth! Please buy this cd because it's so powerful, well written, and well sung that you couldn't possibly ask for more! Those who have criticised it probably only listened to it once and didn't give it a chance...
0790729628|2.0|It sort of makes me sad that this DVD was the way I was introduced to Blade Runner.  A DVD package such as this does not do the movie justice.  Watching the film, I could still realize that this was something great.  Blade Runner addresses the simple questions that have been on the minds and in the hearts of all people for all time...what is it that makes us human?  Do we have a higher purpose in life?  Is our existance the result of our personal choices or are we being moved along by forces beyond our control?  Seems sort of hokey when you're reading it off a screen, but when you experience it lived out on film, it is truly a beautiful sight.  From what I hear about the director's cut is that the film's narration has been omitted and the movie's ending has been altered.  I've read through Deckard's voice over from the theatrical release, and believe me, you don't need it.  The Director's Cut works much better to subtly convey the emotions and themes of the movie.  A quick comment on the ending without spoiling it... it works.  If you truly let the movie engross you, you'll understand why any other ending would be a disappointment.  It's powerful without being preachy.  Science fiction at it's best.<br />A few warnings to DVD buffs and Blade Runner fans.  This isn't a good DVD.  The video and sound quality is nothing special.  The world Ridley Scott creates is amazing.  The DVD just doesn't do it justice.  No extras, no easter eggs, nothing.  Quite a disappointment.  The movie is based from the novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot;  Purists may be upset with some of the departures taken from the novel to make the film.  Then again, if you've read the book, you know that it just wouldn't have worked as a perfect transition into a movie.  Not in 1982, anyway, and I doubt today's world would be able to truly appreciate and accept it either.  <br />The greatness of Blade Runner does shine through in this DVD of the best version of the movie to date.  It's just lacking in so many ways that it's hard to recommend a purchase.  Sadly I fear this masterpiece will become lost in time.  Blade Runner truly deserves to be in a class with all the scifi classics.
B000069AUI|2.0|OK, everybody gives this five stars, and people say &quot;everyone should own this cd.&quot; I can tell there's talent afoot here, but I don't care for this particular flava.  I like Radiohead, but not all post-rock emo and I like Dylan and Nick Drake, but certainly not all post-indigenous folk.  I like Sparklehorse, but not My Morning Jacket.  Say what ya like (or what you don't like) no single band or cd is for everybody.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of those bands that seem as if they have appeared out of nowhere. \\"Fallen\\", their most recent album is currently the best album that they have released. \\"Fallen\\" has only been in stores for a short amount of time, and yet it has already reached the Triple Platinum level. Evanescence has many hit songs on their CD, they are also considered very clean and appropriate for almost all ages, and they are pretty much a one-of-a-kind group.<BR> \\"Fallen\\", which is the highest selling album by  Evanescence, is a really good quality CD. \\"Fallen\\", is a CD well worth purchasing. There are many great hits on the album. For example, three of the most popular songs on the CD, are \\"Bring ME to Life\\", \\"Going Under\\", and \\"My Immortal\\". If you enjoy these three songs, you will really enjoy the whole CD. The only song that is not really that great of a hit is \\"Hello\\". This is probably the least favorite song on the whole CD. Overall, I really recommend the album \\"Fallen\\" to anyone who likes even one song by Evanescence.<BR> \\"Fallen\\", by Evanescence is also appropriate for almost all ages. There are no swear words anywhere on the CD, and the lyrics are well written. Although this is probably not considered a \\"family\\" album, because it is alternative, the content is not at all harmful. \\"Fallen\\" is a clean and appropriate CD for most people.<BR> Evanescence is pretty much a one-of-a-kind group. However, if you really enjoyed \\"Fallen\\", and other songs by Evanescence, there are a few other bands that may sound somewhat like them. Linkin Park is one of the groups that sounds vaguely like Evanescence. Although, Linkin Park is a little more hardcore. Another group that might be considered is Avril Lavigne. She has a voice a lot like the lead singer of Evanescence. Evanescence has used a unique style of music in their album \\"Fallen\\", of which not many other bands are capable of doing. Linkin Park and Avril Lavigne are probably the closest sounding bands to Evanescence. <BR> \\"Fallen\\" is a great CD to purchase, because of the many hit songs, the appropriateness of the album, and because there are not many bands that are able to duplicate their unique sounds. Chances are, if you like one song by Evanescence, you will love their latest CD, \\"Fallen\\".
B00009V7P8|5.0|I came across this CD after hearing the song Cannonball somewhere and I have listened to it almost everyday for the 4 or 5 monthes I've owned it.  The album is incredibly raw, emotional, and brilliant.  I saw Damien live two nights ago and the entire crowd was entranced.  It was the most amazing two hours of my life.  There is not a weak song on this album and as much as I have tried, I cannot pick a favorite.  If there is any hesitation in your mind about buying this CD, I STRONGLY URGE you to just take a chance and buy it.  &quot;O&quot; is the best $15 I ever spent.

0060012358|5.0|A friend gave me this book for my birthday, explaining that it was a book about rats.  Was I ever surprised when I opened the cover and started reading.  It is not just about rats.<br />Pratchett has done his work.  I believe him when he says that he read loads about rats before beginning this.  But not only the rat part is accurate.  When he describes rat writing (pictograms, could be hieroglyphic-like), it parallels the history of the development of human writing.  The rats in this story provide a kind of microcosm of how human society might have developed; their dreams of utopia do not come from out of the blue.  The rats have their version of a holy book, a keeper of the flame, and of course their characters are all very different and sometimes conflict.  Baseness, greed, and corruption all figure in the story, and the rats need to discover how to deal with this new threat called EVIL (as the book's back cover will also tell you).  <br />Although the mentally-mutated (smart) rats naturally figure prominently in the story along with a mentally-mutated cat (Maurice), I think that it also works as an allegory.  You can read this story either for face value or more deeply.  In the latter way, I think that Terry Pratchett critiques current society.  It's funny that reading about rats would make one question humanity, but that's what happened to me!  <br />In a way this book is about having dreams and trying to fulfill them, and getting disillusioned along the way but not giving up.  However, it has no morality overtones and despite its seriousness, it is also pretty funny (take the tap-dancing rat named Sardines, for instance).  The story ends on a happy note too but it isn't overly saccharine.  In a way, it's like pop philosophy and a good story rolled into one.  <br />I was also able to read this story without knowing anything at all about Discworld.
B0000T6JH4|1.0|Yes...I can understand McCartney's complaints that Phil Spector's overproduction on the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album destroyed The Beatles' intentions with the project. But, I admit, when I first heard of &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; I had said, &quot;This I've gotta hear!&quot;, expecting something along the lines of a reproduction of the original, ill-fated &quot;Get Back&quot; album, some excerpts of which were released on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;. However, I was quite surprised when I purchased &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; and found it quite literally being the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album -albeit in a different track order, and adding &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; (the original B-side of &quot;Get Back&quot;)- minus Phil Spector's additions. Yes, the orchestral arrangements were a little bit overbearing, but the offhand &quot;Dig It&quot; jam as well as the between song patter (&quot;'I dig a pygmy'...&quot;) is gone as well. Yes, the sound is clearer, but that's 2003 technology compared to 1969 is all. In a nutshell, I already own &quot;Let It Be&quot;! Now it's like I have two copies of the same album...and the addtional &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; CD is nothing but a twenty one minute teaser. All in all, &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is a bit of a ripoff, and I doubt I was the only Beatles fan who more or less felt cheated by it. Clearly Apple Corps is milking The Beatles name and their catalog for all its worth (but what else is new? Look at the umpteen million old Capitol compilations!). It all leaves me wondering if, considering Michael Jackson owns The Beatles' catalog, if he knew he'd be having legal troubles, and needed the extra cash all the royalties from &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; would give him. In hindsight, there's nothing wrong with the 1970 original (sorry, Paul)...obviously Spector had a good reason to make his additions; the performances weren't exactly of normal Beatles' caliber to begin with...&quot;Across The Universe&quot; and &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; admittedly needed the extra work. Without the overdubs, they just sound tired and unperfected. &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is a disappointment.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have read a lot of reviews relating Linkin Park and Evanescence together, and after having the CD and heavily digesting it, i gotta tell you, nothing could be further from the truth. To compare and rate this band to Linkin Park is like caomparing an apple and an orange. They're both fruit, they both make music, but that's it. Granted, the two almost exclusively played Evanescence tracks on the airwaves have a similar ring of guitar to Linkin Park's, that's where the similarity ends, and that's just 2 songs. Dont get me wrong, i am not trying to bag Linkin Park here at all, I think they are musically talented, but there are stark differences here between the 2. Ok, let's get to the grit:<BR>Why evanescence receives 5 stars:<BR>1: the most powerful female voice i have ever heard belting out hard and loud the lyrics that some only whimper out. Normally, I like music that puts the voice in the background and the music out front, here, it's a stark change in my habits, and a refreshing breath of fresh air. Amy Lee(Vocalist) has an amazing voice and is not afraid to use it, loud and clear.<BR>2: Very well created music, guitar, drums, and bass, very well woven together and mastered beautifully. Ben (guitarist) is very capable and powerful as a guitarist, and sticks to veyr solid and strong riffs. I dont think there's a single time when teh guitar should have sounded fuller.<BR>3: Very impressive lyrics. I havent read or heard lyrics this strong or powerful in a very long time, it's very obvious that Amy and Ben are very capable and talented at opening their heart and putting it in a very beautiful medium that speaks to people on a very personal level, which brings me to point 4.<BR>4: these are kids who create, write, and record music for one purpose. THEY LOVE IT! They are not some manufactured band designed to make a few million bucks(or more) by becoming a preformed image of what marketers are telling the record companies what the kids wanna hear, and making a band fit that image so that they can sell it. Their music fits no mold, and is evident from the hevay guitar to the well played and composed piano, to the amazing choir in the songs, orchestrated by amy, a definite progidy in music.<BR>5: It's just amazing to hear a nice breath of fresh air from an otherwise manufactured music world. Want a nice CD to speak to you? get this. Like Music thats &quot;abnormal?&quot; get it. Want a band thats like you and i? get it. are there songs on here that you may not like? most likely, everyone is different. but you wont be dissapointed if you like music that's different, talented, different, and capable.
B000056K04|2.0|The first DMB song I ever heard was &quot;The Space Between,&quot; which I instantly fell in love with. Yes, I know, all the hardcore fans are going to jump all over me for that...but it really is a good song. That's why, as soon as I could, I went out and bought this CD, which has the song on it, simply because that's what I do. I was instantly disappointed by most of the tracks I heard, and so turned to ever-faithful Amazon.com to see what other people had thought of it. I took one person's suggestion to listen to some of the older songs, like Crush, and comparing the two now, I really find this album very lacking in whatever it was the others had. Its few redeeming tracks (mainly Space Between and So Right) were simply not enough to make up for the others, especially considering the excellence of other songs and albums by DMB. I really would not recommend anyone to buy this; if anything, buy &quot;The Space Between&quot; online, from something like Apple's Itunes Music Store, because that song at least is worth the money paid for it.

B0000T6JH4|1.0|As if switching &quot;Lennon/McCartney&quot; to &quot;McCartney/Lennon&quot; wasn't bad enough (of an insult to John Lennon's memory) on the &quot;Back In The USA&quot; album, now we have literally a reissue of what most people consider The Beatles' weakest album to begin with, made altogether weaker by wimpy sound (the guitars are buried in the mix, and all the rooftop ambience of &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot; and &quot;One After 909&quot; is GONE.) So, who cares if &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; was smothered in orchestration? One, it needed it (according to many Beatles books, including Lewisohn's &quot;Recording Sessions&quot;, John Lennon made so many mistakes on the bass it had to be covered up!) and, besides, people have heard the song like that for 33 years already. Heck, the whole album...no, &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is simply more of Paul McCartney trying to singlehandedly take credit for The Beatles' accomplishments. He's nothing as a solo artist anymore, so all Sir Paul can do is go on, &quot;Hi, remember me!!!I'm a former Beatle!&quot; He's worse than Jagger or Bowie or any of those guys for living off of his past (at least they manage to pull of something new that's actually good once in a while!.) I doubt very highly, if Lennon or Harrison were still around, this revamped &quot;Let It Be&quot; would exist (after all, L &amp; H were the ones who commissioned Phil Spector to make something out of the original in the first place!) Yes, good or bad, McCartney more or less made the whole &quot;Let It Be/Get Back&quot; project happen back in 1969. But two versions of the same album are not necessary. A better idea (what I was expecting, truth be told) would have been to issue the original &quot;Get Back&quot; album with the original Glyn Johns mixes in the original sleeve design (what became the front cover of &quot;1967-1970&quot; (Blue Album)) All &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is is more of McCartney's ego-stroking...and I doubt very highly that he needs the money.
B000002ARV|5.0|Johnny Winter's &quot;comeback&quot; album from 1973.  Johnny is one of the most underrated guitar players that ever picked up a 6-string.  While deeply rooted in the blues, Johnny delivers some rippin' stripped-down rock and roll on this album.  Production is held to a very minimum of overdubs, and it's basically Johnny with his bass player and drummer.  No effects, no slick production tricks, just good old rock and roll.  He's one of those rare guys that can just plug the guitar into and amp and rip it up.   In addition to his masterful playing, Johnny serves up some of his patented gritty, soulful vocals.<br />I have worn out two copies of this album, and one or two 8-track copies.  This is the fourth time I have bought this, and it's just as fresh as it was in 1973.  <br />If you like simple straight forward rock and roll from a master guitarist, this is a mandatory album for your collection.
2842630254|4.0|J'ai lu ce recueil de nouvelles suite aux critiques lue sur le site et je remercie ceux qui l'ont recommandé. Ils m'ont permis de découvrir un petit bouquin charmant et plein de fraîcheur ainsi qu'une auteure que je ne connaissais pas et dont j'ai beaucoup aimé la plume. <br />On se reconnaît un peu dans ces histoires et c'est amusant de voir le regard que jette l'auteure sur les petits et grands moments du quotidien. Plusieurs petites anecdoctes m'ont fait sourire. Le ton qu'elle donne à ses nouvelles les rends aussi très pétillantes. <br />Bref c'est un beau petit livre pas très long mais vraiment bon. Je le recommande fortement.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I waited for three years for &quot;X2&quot; to be released, and I walked into the theater saying to myself, &quot;Please God, don't let this movie suck like Batman and Robin&quot;.  I walked out of it a happy person, as Bryan Singer continues the X-Men saga in high fashion.<br />&quot;X2&quot; is an improvement over its predecessor in almost every single way.  It is longer and the charatcers are given more screen time.  The action is better (the military attack on the X-school is probably the film's action highlight).  The script is tighter and more focused, and the film is overall much more ambitious.<br />Singer took some obvious risks with &quot;X2&quot;.  Its themes are very dark for a mainstream comic book movie- genocide, parental rejection, repressed trauma.  Magneto continues to be a great villain- not evil, but horribly misguided.  Forcing him and the X-Men into an uneasy alliance was probably Singer's best move.  The theme of the X-Men's curse is made more obvious here- they are doomed to protect people who hate and fear them.  However, beneath all the darkness, this film is still fun- there's a couple moments of comic relief, and Wolverine still exudes a playful charm.  Singer manages to strike the right balance here between welcome in-jokes and downright campiness, such as what the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise fell into.<br />To make things even better, &quot;X2&quot; is fully loaded with special features, including commentary and several making-of documentaries.  I would highly recommend this film not only for X-Men fans, but fans of good action films in general.  It's much better than most of the other stuff released this year, a welcome relief from the disappointments of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels, and &quot;Terminator 3&quot;.  I simply love this movie.
B000002MP2|5.0|i have a couple of other Green Day cds but by far this is my favorite because so of it is true punk and other is pop-punk but all around it is the greatest Green Day cd ever
B000002MUN|5.0|I own a half dozen Tom Petty albums and all of them are great. But this one it utterly addicting. There is so much variety on it, so many ups and downs, such a beautiful sound, that I can't stop listening to it. Just great.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I picked up this copy on my way out of Best Buy because of 'Where Is The Love' and the fact that it was 10 bucks, and I am so so so glad I did.  If you buy one CD that's hot right now, this is it, no question.  I love EVERY SINGLE SONG on this baby!  If you though &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; was good, think again-- they top it many times on here!
B00009TB5G|4.0|I'm a huge &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; geek.  I've seen both films countless times and I've read the books twice.  Though it was an excellent movie, I was somewhat upset with the theatrical cut of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; for not following the book.  That is somewhat remedied in the Special Edition, which has some nice extras.<br />There is between 30 and 45 minutes of added footage (I've heard various numbers and I didn't bother to time it), and for the most part I loved it.  There are some scenes that add nothing to the film and probably should have stayed cut from the film- a nightime conversation between Aragorn and Gandalf and a final goodbye between Faramir and Frodo are the most glaring examples.<br />However, the character of Faramir is finally given some justice in the Special Edition, as he's shown as a more complex and conflicted character (unfortunately, it still takes him a while to let Frodo and Sam go).  I also loved the added footage of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard- look for references to the cut Tom Bombadil scene from &quot;Fellowship&quot;.  Overall, the characters are better fleshed out, and their interaction with one another is far more interesting than it had been in the theatrical cut.<br />I'd definitely recommend the Special Edition to fans of the book.  It overall feels much more like a Tolkien product than the theatrical cut, and adds some scenes that they would have liked to have seen in the original cut.  However, the more casual fans of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; who only like the action may want to stick with the theatrical cut- the Special Edition has a lot more talking than fighting.  Me being a book fan, I absolutely loved this version.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This movie was one that I originally did not want to see because I am not one to enjoy dreamy romantic comedies. The difference with this movie is that it actually contains comedians. Two of my favorite UK comedians-Rowan Atkinson and Kris Marshall. I knew that even though this was romantic it certainly would be funny. It was hysterical and realistic.My favorite performances in the film were from these two actors. Kris Marshall as the goofy sandwhich seller turned ladies man in Wisconsin of all places had me in stitches. In all of the reviews I have read I have noticed that Kris Marshall has been very underestimated especially in the U.S. In all of his roles be they comic or tragic he puts his whole heart and soul into it. The same can be said for the many comic roles of Rowan Atkinson who is more well known to international audiences. When Kris or Rowan take on a scene it belongs to them. They own it! If you want to laugh and feel some sort of hope about love with a dash of warm fuzzy-go see Love Actually!!!!!!!
0780020685|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever!
0451167716|5.0|Recently, I've read The Godfather again and I quite couldn't stop  reading! Read this novel is a great pleasure. <br />I think some people don't regard it as great literature because this work doesn't have: flowers, metaphors and blablabla's that most people admire in classic books. In my humble opinion, this is such a great story that doesn't have space for these things (and don't need them). This is a book written in a very simple style.<br />However, as I said, Mario Puzo had in mind a great tale. The Godfather, for me, is the story of Michael Corleone, the kid son of Don Corleone (the kingpin of the Mafia in New York). This story show us how we cannot control our lives, how our families, our honor, and the enviroment around us, makes us what we are!<br />Michael Corleone is the wisest son of Don Corleone but he doesn't want to become a Mafia Don as his father! Different of his brothers he decides to be out of his \\"family's business\\". He wants to become a typical american citizen. He goes to fight in the second world war, goes to college, dates an american woman, and he doesn't take his father's advices. He is the toughest and independent of his brothers.<br />But in one day everything changes for Michael. In the day that his father is shot and he goes to see him in the hospital!!! When he gets a punch from a police captain that is being paid to help killing Don Corleone, Michael sees that he cannot avoid entering in his family's business anymore. Then his destiny is traced and he no longer can live the life he has been planning.<br />Beyond the Michael tale, the lives of all the other characters in this book are well explored and detailed. This is the point where the movies are not very good, for me. In the movies we don't have access to the thoughts and motivations of the main characters, we don't see how wise some of them are, which is one of the greatest pleasures in the book.<br />The blood thirsty of Sonny Corleone and his mafia war is not well explored inthe movies (we just see some newspapers!!). The Johny Fontane character. The story of Conny Corleone, the daughter of Don Corleone, etc. There are a lot of details that aren't and couldn't be covered in the movie.<br />For the fans of great stories I strongly recommend this book.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Why are there so many people reviewing this CD based on musical politics?  Why can't music just be about the MUSIC?  You either like the band or you don't, there's no need to launch into a nostalgic rant or a blind criticism about how they cater to the \\"MTV\\" crowd.  The only time I watched MTV was for Clone High.  Anyway, getting back to the original point, I was initially disappointed with Meteora because the band's style seemed so different from Hybrid Theory, which quickly rose to one of my all-time favorite CDs.  I think this one is a little more pop, a little less rock (I can't think of a better category, sue me).  After listening to it a few times, though, the songs really caught in my head.  It's still not as good as the first one, but it's a good alternative, since I've listened to the first one so often I'm pretty sick of it.  Standout tracks include Somewhere I Belong, Faint, and Numb.  A good, solid CD, and I hope to hear more from the band soon.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is a story of survival, of endurance,of faith and of determination. the way Pi survives in the most dire circumstances and the most weird aspect is that he is stuck with a tiger(Richard Parker) on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific...Yann Martel has included many things to make the book a stunner...the humour, the mystery, the breath-taking challenges, the extent of testing one's belief...one asks himself if that is possible...can someone have really survived months?the questions we ask ourselves are sometimes left without answer...the last part Pi tells a second story...it is left up to the  readers to decide which one they will prefer to believe...the story is incredible and one i;ve never encountered before.i really recommend the book...just one advice, the book at the beginning may seem very confusing and not understandable, but just wait for the second part!!!!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|While I understand the time constraints on theater-release movies are stricter than home release, the theater version definitely feels choppy and incomplete next to the extended edition. Only a half hour in, and I'd seen several deleted scenes which really enriched and expanded on the story. I think there's fourty minutes in all of new scenes. On top of that there's two full disks of behind the scenes extras, from the evolution of Gollum to the construction of Helm's Deep and Rohan, concept art, and many, many interviews with cast members. Just about every aspect of the film is covered. Even if you already have the first Two Towers dvd, I'd recommend this one. It's well worth it.
B00008EY9G|3.0|This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film.  Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night.  One by one they are getting murdered.  It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters.  There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.<br />John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop.  Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner.  There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word.  There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.<br />But this is not a usual &quot;whodunit&quot;.  No way.  The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed.  To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.<br />Yes, it held my interest.  Yes, there was some good acting.  But I hated the ending and felt the writer had played a rotten trick on the audience.  That's why I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.
B000127LW2|1.0|I am a big fan of all the Star Trek series. I have all the DS-9 and 6 of 7 Next Gen but I dont think in good conscience I can pay the normal 100 dollars for a severely shortened season.  All I ask is for the greed to get turned down a notch.  Please I beg you.  A lot of loyal Star Trek fans are not gonna pick this season up due to the extravagent price.  Other than that I have to have to say I plan to buy the other seasons of Voyager.  It really was a good show.  The cast really came together over the seven seasons.  They started with some really good chemistry and ended with even more.  I beg Paramount, please please please lower the price of this DVD.
B000002IHD|5.0|If I could,I would  give Otis Blue 6 stars.<BR>This was the first album I ever bought, and it's turned out to be the greatest ever made,in my opinion.<BR>Incredibly, all 11 tracks were recorded in a 24 hour period.<BR>Considering the technology of the time,the sound quality is hard to belive.<BR>But Otis could have made these songs into jewels under almost any conditions.We're blessed that those conditions were instead almost optimal,thanks to musicians like Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper.<br />If you only buy one Otis Redding album,this should be the one.
B0000009SI|5.0|At 0 minutes and 17 seconds of 'Apostrophe', the title track, is pure bliss.  This album is a must have, if only to hear that single, orgasmic guitar riff.
B000002HH9|3.0|When I bought this album, and listened to it, I found myself a little confused about what it was trying to say and why it just didn't sound like the dark-edgy cure we were used to listen years before with Disintegration and Co. There are some unusual tunes in this CD, like the caribbean inspired &quot;The13th&quot;, or the wacky &quot;Gone!&quot; that make you wonder what Smith was going through when he wrote them. I must admit that this album didn't hold me mesmerized at first, and I even thought some of its songs, like &quot;club america&quot; were kindda bad. However, after a closer inspect, I started to understand the territory the band was exploring here, and very thought-inducing songs like &quot;this is a lie&quot;, &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;jupiter crash&quot; kept drilling in my ears and resounded in my mind for weeks.<BR>At first look, Wild Mood Swings might sound a little too happy or even uninspired for your goth taste. Songs like &quot;mint car&quot; or &quot;round&amp;round&amp;round&quot; might appear a little too soft and superficial at first, but once you start to understand the space that the album dives into, you realize that the band is trying to communicate a wicked point of view about being grown and finding some reward after such a prosperous-but-always-gloomy career. <BR>With Wild Mood Swings, the band tries to express what they understand as happyness, but like the cracked clown in the cover of the CD, they hopelessly render themselves unable to fullfill their own wish to be happy as their songs keep having the ever crying and opportune happy-but-nostalgic lyrics by the unique Robert Smith. <BR>Despite a few songs, I find this CD highly recommendable, as it explores an always obscure side of The cure: A need to be happy and rest.<br />The Cure are forever sad mimmes singing in the dark. No matter how happy their songs might sound like, they always end up communicating a very melacolic and sad view of their own reality. And that is no a bad thing.
B000001E3V|5.0|I'm ashamed.  Truly.<br />For years I've always dismissed Clapton as a pop singer...who's best work might have been a few radio friendly Cream tunes.  Whenever my friends and I would find ourselves discussing great, legendary bands/guitarists we would always agree on bands like The Allmans, Vaughn, The Dead, Hendrix, Zappa among many others.<br />Friends would always speak about Clapton, telling me to &quot;Check out his early stuff&quot;.  Like I said, I always stopped at Cream when thinking about Clapton's &quot;early stuff&quot;...as they never appealed to me.<br />I found myself with a few bucks to spare and picked this album up because, honestly, I didn't have any Clapton at the time.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />To make a long story short...this album is incredible.  This, or the Allman's Fillmore show, are what I usually listen to when I want to crank some unapologetic guitar work.  This is great, great music.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I haven't listened to this greatest hits album, but I have heard all of the songs before, since I own all their albums. I must say I'm disappointed in the song selections. Several songs here do not deserve to be on a greatest hits album. There are too many songs from Barrett and Division Bell. And some of Floyd's greatest songs are missing. Where's Interstellar Overdrive, Braindamage/Eclipse, Welcome to the Machine, Mother, Young Lust, and Run Like Hell???<br />I'll give it 5 stars anyway, because there are still many great songs on this album. But it could have been better.
B0000DI86O|5.0|Until recently (November 2003) the only DVD edition of Andrea Chenier was a 1975 film version with Franco Corelli in the title role.  This one is much better.  It is an excellent live production filmed at Covent Garden in 1985.  It illustrates why the Royal Opera is one of the world's leading companies.<br />The three principals -- Placido Domingo as Chenier, Anna Tomowa-Sintow as Maddalena de Coigny, and Giorgio Zancanaro as Carlo Gerard -- are all in the prime of their careers at the time of this filming, and handle their roles superbly.  They are backed up by a solid group of supporting singers.  The orchestra does justice to Giordano's rich score without ever drowning out the singers.  The sets and costumes are appropriate and never distracting.  In short, this is exactly what one would expect to see in a first-rate production at a first-rate opera house.
B000075BFK|5.0|I got this album about a month ago and its tight. Some of the biggest names in the industry r on dis like Nas,Trick Daddy, T.I.,Mya, and of course the Outlawz.  <br />Best tracks are, well, all of them.
B00006AG5N|5.0|There is no entertainer more famous than Elvis Presley, consider that this man split the history of modern music in two. The underground vibrations of blues, the popular form of country and the classic sense of gospel all came into a revolutionary clash and mingle embodied by Elvis. Without Elvis you don't get The Beatles, Jim Morrison, Aerosmith, Bono, Marilyn Manson or anything called rock n' roll, he embodied what the word was and what the music meant. It is only fitting that The King of Rock N' Roll get a collection polished to have a sound quality better than even the latest U2 release. &quot;30 #1 Hits&quot; pulses, grinds and croons with songs that are forever famous, some have become so deeply etched into the psyche of the world that it is hard sometimes to understand how Elvis changed the world of music. His face and mannerisms have already been converted into the stuff of worldwide parody or the decor of a postage stamp, but that is only testament to the impact of the man who is known by first name alone. This album contains his #1 hits, some are classics we all hear at some point or another in our lives like &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; or &quot;It's Now Or Never.&quot; The difference is here they have been lovingly polished to a gloss, the sound quality is extremely impressive, never sounding low or dated. Nobody can deny that this is the best-sounding Elvis collection ever released. It is on par with the sound quality of a newly released album. And of course, the music is great. &quot;Can't Help Falling In Love&quot; has to be one of the greatest of all ballads, a wonderfully dreamy expression. &quot;You're The Devil In Disguise&quot; is pure rock n' roll fun with a catchy chorus and memorable production. &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; remains one of Elvis' best cuts, it's catchy, and good pop fare, but it's also deep and moving with exquisite production. Some of the tracks have reportedly been remixed from the originals, is it a problem? Of course not if you appreciate good music, nothing here feels weak or tampered with. Bettered, yes, ruined, no. Few singers can have such a memorable voice like that of Elvis Presley, his is a deep baritone, rich and full and filled with driven talent. Traces of the vocal influence can be found everywhere from The Doors' &quot;The Crystal Ship&quot; to U2's &quot;With Or Without You.&quot; &quot;30 #1 Hits&quot; is a great collection of the 20th century's biggest singer, it has been compared to &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; but let's remember, without the material here, that album wouldn't be around.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Finally the greatest band ever puts out a live CD. Zeppelin fans can rest easy the first live Zeppelin CD is here and it is outstanding. From begining to end this CD captures the magic of a live Zeppelin show. From Jimmy page's bow/guitar solo on Dazed and confused to John Bonham's hand drum solo on Moby dick this 3 CD set is essential for not only zeppelin fans but all music fans. This CD captures the band in the early years when they made their best music and since i bought it, it hasn't left my CD player. I suggest everyone get this album and if your on the fence about it allow me to push you over. BUY THIS NOW!!!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Yes, Reloaded disappointed many, but not as many as Revolutions did! ;) This sequel is fun, has great action, creative new characters, unlogical abilities, relatively weak plot and the beginning is terribly slow. But, this DVD has some great features, including a how-did-they-do-that regarding the nearly 15 minute long freeway chase scene. The great thing about this DVD is you can skip all the crap and go straight to the good stuff, over and over again!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|People have been unkind to this film, thing is I agree with everything they say.  It is all about look and style and fashion and precious little about story and plot/character development.  Yes......and?  Did these naysayers see the previews?  I did.  I saw a very cool,sleek and dangerous femme fatale in a skin tight shiny latex/leather outfit shooting cool guns, at one point through the floor in a circle so she could, I assume, fall through in slow motion.  Cool.  I went to see it and what did I see?  The exact same thing everyone else saw.  Blue filtered, gothic high fashion, high octane fun.  Lots of Kate Beckansale, debatable the most underrated actress of her generation, at least in the colonies, doing her shoot em up ultra cool girl vampire thing.  She is the picture of icy cool detached British rage, James Bond meets Vamperella, what's wrong with that?  I don't think anyone is getting an academy award for this but so what?  It was entertaining, stylish and fun.  I for one am glad to see a well crafted bit of Saturday afternoon hokum played out so well...
B000002UA2|5.0|As Nick Mason said ''I thought it was an excellent album, actually''.<br />I love all songs on it but the closing track, that loses interest when the music fades and the tribal chanting comes in. Highlights to me include Wut's uh the deal (Lovely, really), Mudmen (One of the best Floyd instrumentals ever. Just love that piano and keyboard intro, especially), Childhood's end (For once Dave wrote a lyric, and not average), Free four (Catchy yet serious song by Waters) and Stay, that I absolutely love. The rest of the songs I love as well.<br />If you love Pink Floyd or good music you gotta get this one.<br />5/5.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I'm surprised to read so many dissatisfied reviews of \\"Afterglow,\\" as I find the album to be vintage Sarah.<br />As we've become numbed by bubble gum pop stars, I think we've forgotten what an authentic artist sounds and feels like. Sure, the album is mellow and, at moments a bit dark, but she's put together something moving and individual here.<br />As far as the addition of synthesized sounds, I recall Sarah being on the cusp of that trend a few albums ago. Should we fault her for using a technique that defines her?<br />Overall, the album is interesting and classic Sarah. Being as mellow as it is (\\"Fallen\\" is probably the most lively on the CD), you can throw this one in and leave it from start to finish. I enjoy this very much and am happy to own it!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I was a little skeptical at first when I heard this cd in my friends car. But I had only heard 2 songs out of the whole cd (weak and powerless, and a stranger). I guess I was curious as to how the rest of the cd was, and although I was really picky at first, the songs really grew on me (especially, Blue, Vanishing and The Noose). Anyone who is having a hard time being inspired, or just needs some out of the norm music to listen to, i suggest you download this cd, or buy it. Give it a while and it will grow on you too!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Kudos to the marketers of this album!!! To make up for britney's way-below-average-voice, there are many very catchy tunes in the cd that help 'revive' this album. Britney should thank her marketers, record company and the producers for her success in the music industry. With technolody so advanced, any voice can be drowned out/made pleasant/ or made markatable. So this album is just one of those highly digitalized albums. If that's what you're looking for, get this album...
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you thought the LOTR: FOTR ExEd was the best, you're in a real treat, this is the sequel to the best dvd ever made!  Does it live up to the first Extended Edition? Of course it does! Go buy it now!, there are simply no words! It is just so good!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|well... tis not quite up to standard... britney tries too hard to sell records... tis might b her most 'mature' album but she reali doesnt hv e voice 2 carry n bring out the songs... there's no powerful in her voice... honestly, i dun tink her voice is even passable!.. n she's called a 'singer'... tis sure isnt as 'bubblegummy' as e past albums but is enough 2 put it on my hate-list...
6303921248|5.0|This is the absolute best version of Jane Austin's classic that has ever been filmed. It follows the book, right on down to the dialog. The casting is impecible, I cannot imagine anyone better to play any of the roles. Colin Firth is appropriately brooding, and his expressions speak volumes. We have watched the five-tape set over and over again, and it is as enjoyable the 20th time as it was the first. Highly recommended! See it, you won't regret it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is the one and only person who can preform the songs and the interaction on this DVD. I know many others can and do sing and interact really well but Shania has reached a higher plain and has reached the place above a Diva or super star. If she continues to grow even her distracters will have to admit that she is one of if not the best singer preformer. This DVD is an excellent highlight of just how good she is. It brings to the front all of her talent and ability. She is a great singer preformer and like I said this DVD shows it.
B000031WD9|5.0|I like to review the film by itself and then the DVD...<br />Film - No one avoided this film like me. From what I had seen and heard about the film, it seemed that the writer and director took themselves way too seriously for a typical sex-filled teen comedy. Luckily, this film is not typical. The writing is crisp and the jokes are very funny. The characters reflect real teens (although they are all well-spoken and extremely pretty). The teen boys are neither jerks nor big softies (with the exception of Chris Klein's character). The girls are not naive, but also not entirely jaded. The acting is solid. The result is a film that is funny but that also can be taken as a look at kids today.<br />DVD - Awesome! Lots of special features, almost too many (soundtrack presentation?). The commentary is entertaining, and outtakes are always fun.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has struck the mother load in music in this DVD. She is now moving in the most richest part of her career and will continue to do so as long as she wishes. Her career will hit another higher level as it did when she came out with The woman in me and Come on over. This DVD is the lauching pad for the next step in her career. You can only enjoy each and every sound on this DVD.
B000002UAU|5.0|I find the first and last songs of any album to be the most important.  For me, these are the songs that are the album's trademark. Exhibit 'A' - The Beatles 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'.  You can't get any stronger than leading off with &quot;Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/With A Little Help From My Friends&quot; and ending with the &quot;Reprise&quot; and &quot;A Day In the Life&quot;.  They are unquestionably some of the most popular songs of our lifetime.<br />I tend to like the more Rock sounding tunes on this album (or any album for that matter), such as &quot;Getting Better&quot;, &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot;, and both &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; tracks.  Strong guitar work and melodies that get stuck in your head and stay there.  But my favorite song remains &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;.  It's STILL the masterpiece of Sgt Pepper!  Although there are a couple of songs that I never liked (&quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; and the unlistenable &quot;Within You, Without You&quot;), the rest of the album is classic late 60's Beatles.  <br />Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band continues to be the standard which other musical artists try to achieve in their own careers.  We're pushing 40 years,and it still spends ample time in my car CD player.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is Up and beyond the people in her music in Chicago. She is so high on the energy from the fans and the stage that she is giving a great preformance. You cannot guess she ahs been gone for close to three years from her voice and ability on stage. She has not missed a beat and she is still getting better as this DVD shows.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie absoulutely blew me away, Not since the spectacular that was the lion king has anything even come close.  However finding nemo is what you would call the under sea version.  The heartfelt story behind the tale of a fathers love for his son and the comedy that is Dory, you'll feel like you've met her for the first time every time.  Backed up by a great ensemble cast each character has their own unique features and insecurities.  If you are looking for a great idea this christmas give the gift that is finding nemo, to be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
B0000TB03W|5.0|I posted this early but it seems not to have taken. Shania needs not worry about being seen as a crossover singer. Shania sings her music and does it her way. She can move the youngest or oldest fan with her songs and this DVD is an excellent example of this talent. She is not a singer you can fit into one little area and say thats her style.
B0000T6JH4|5.0|The best thing they could have done was to take all the Spector crap out of these songs. McCartney never wanted that nut involved anyway and now the music sounds like he wanted it to. That is what I want, not some crap from a dopped up old has been (Spector).
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's DVD Up Live In Chicago is well worth the amount you pay for it. The DVD has the best music she has done to date. I know some of them are oes she has recorded already but with the clear crisp smooth voice she has after the rest she took it improved the sound of all the songs. She is a excellent preformer (needs some dance improvement) and she totally enjoys singing and bringing her songs to the fans. This is a must purchase for anyone who enjoys Shania.
B00005UW9T|5.0|I have never written a review, but felt compelled to do so when I read the mediocre reviews Anastasia had received so far.  My daughter &amp; I first saw Anastasia in the movie theater &amp; we LOVED it!...the music is some of the best I have ever heard (it is up there with Beauty &amp; the Beast and Lion King.)  There was a song writer and lyricist who wrote all of the songs and they did an awesome job!  We bought the music CD after seeing the movie &amp; we still listen to it.  The movie was great also (the Rasputin character was a little out there &amp; seemed cartoonish, but every good movie has an evil bad guy.)  The detailed palace scenes and the rest of the movie was spectacular.  The rest didn't seem cartoonish at all, but very real.  And who goes to the movies to see reality, we go to see a happy ending!!  I recommend this movie to any family with a 7 to 13 year old girl...and watch it with her, you will enjoy it too  :)<br />Another favorite of ours is Drew Barrymore in Everafter.  Five Stars on that one too.
B0000TB03W|5.0|On one of Shania's other albums I think it was titled Limestone collection someone said something about it being the real Shania. Well folks here is the real Shania. The Shania that stands out like a bright shinning star far above anyone else and far brighter than anyoe else. She is a women of many and great talents. She has proven over and over again that she is the real thing and this DVD once again disproves those who like to put her down for whatever the reason.
0312319517|5.0|With Forsyth's latest, Avenger, he has catapulted himself back to the forefront of thriller writers. Avenger is for anyone interested in a very well written book with a highly intelligent plot, excellent character development and a pace that -- while not always fast-moving -- will keep your eyes glued to the pages. I should warn you, though, that if you looking for a thriller with lot of slam-bang action, Avenger may not be for you. The basic plot is about a young American volunteer who is killed in Bosnia and the hiring of the Avenger to try to seek vengeance on the person responsible. However, the real plot of this book is much more involved and covert than this -- but is one that I won't describe further so as to not reveal the story line that really makes Avenger suspenseful. All I will say again is what I said in my title for this review -- Some crimes are better left unpunished.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Like Shania said in one of her songs LETS GO. This DVD is so good we all need to lets go and get it and watch it. She looks great, sings great, mixs with the fans great and her band does a great job. This is an all around excellent DVD that anyone who sees it will enjoy it.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|This is a undeniabley great film but somehow it lacks somethings which are hard to name. Dory is by far the best of the film. The fish tank bits are the bits that make this film struggle a bit. Anyways this movie is so good I enjoyed it like I enjoyed &quot;Monsters,inc&quot; for me this is beating &quot;Toy Story&quot;<br /> right now because &quot;Toy...&quot; is getting a bit old. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has amazing graphics and it looks so real. This is definitley one film you should see. The DVD is good aswell it holds lots of special features but not as much as &quot;Monsters,inc&quot; this film is superb one of the few Pixar Films which wins audiences hearts. This is a great movie I totally reccomend it, just a few things make this film lose 1 star. Plus The DVD packaging is really good too.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~GRAB SHELL DUDE!~~~~~~~~~~~~
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is better than the other DVD's Shania has put out to date. I have seen the others and this is a major cut above the other ones. Do not misuderstand the other DVD's are truely excellent but this one has more life, strenght, stronger beter voice and so on. It is better that excelelnt but I do not know how to say or what word to use to say that. Shania has steped up and hit a home run with just outstanding music.
0553565915|1.0|I borrowed this book from the library, and it was so disturbing! I am of a Pagan religion, and I can't believe that the author only goes into one paragraph on people of other religious faiths! Then she comes back and says, &quot;We will all know Christ in this life or the next&quot; and then she proceeds to write another book on how Jesus appears to people of other religions and seems to convert them??? I do not believe in Jesus, and I hate how Ms. Eadie quoted scripture from the Bible! There are 26 versions of the Bible, so how can it be the unaltered word of god? It's like Jesus was saying, &quot;You can believe whatever you want, but you're wrong and you'll be sorry when you meet me.&quot; I do think we should love and respect each other more, but the love-is-all-that-matters message belongs in a child's fairy tale. This is the real world, and love isn't everything. I also hated how, when the author was brought before the council of men, she discovered and accepted that, &quot;Men have their roles, and I have mine.&quot; Excuse me??? Is that all were good for- having children??? I do not want to meet Jesus or a god if he doesn't treat men and women equally! I also don't think a loving god would allow bad things to happen and then chalk it uu to a spiritual agreement that we can't remember here in the physical world, as Ms. Eadie does. That's too easy a solution! Victims do exist, and I don't think an incest victim wants to hear that she/he chose to be attacked in order to grow spiritually. The author claims to be friends with really old guys in long flowing robes who are monks??? What drugs was she on?? And warrior angels running around with clubs saying they're going to fight Satan? That cracks me up! But this book put me in a spiritual crisis, and it seems to want to convert all it's readers to Christianity. I'd like to meet my own deities when I die, and my view of the afterlife would be a bit more realistic than the author's. Her message was too positive- merry-sunshine type. If you're a dihard believer in Christ, this book is for you, but a much better book is Sylvia Browne's &quot;Life on the Other Side- A Psychic's Tour of the Afterlife&quot;. Ms. Eadie wants to tell us all that this book, and Christ's message, ie truth, and &quot;there is only one truth.&quot; But in the words of Marion Zimmer Bradley, truth has many faces, and what is real for one person might not be real for another.ry-sunshine type.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania does an excellent job in moving around the stage so all can see her. This does not matter in the DVD because you have excellent shots of her all around the stage. She has some good moves and some not so good moves. It is one area she needs to pick up in. She is so excellent in all other areas it is hard to say she needs improvement in any area but she does. It does not effect or distrack from the DVD because the music and the singing is so good.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|my title says it all. not worth reviewing...hmmm..wheres my sarah mclaclan CD...
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you want to have a great rock'n party that no one will forget grab this DVD invite a whole lot of folks set up the food and drinks along with the dance area and let her rip. This DVD will rock and party the night away. Shania gets up the energy and meets the challange and takes the high road to put out a have to have DVD. Shania will have to work to out do this DVD but seeing how she has worked in the past I have no doubt she will be able to jump up and get it done. Excellent DVD a must have.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|For those who thought Whitney Houston had lost it, just buy this fantastic album. Here Houston proves, and shows, how holiday classics should be sung. From The First Nol, to Joy to the world take this ride with the queen. Definately a must have. What are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is a singer who has an abilty to relate to one and all. It does not matter what your social or economic backgrounds are. What your major area of intrest is in music. What your ethnic background is. This DVD touches everyone that hears it in many different ways. There is joy, laughter, love, happiness etc and everyone who hears it enjoys it. Shania is an all around singer for everyone in many different areas. You cannot say she is just Country or Country Rock or Pop or whatever. She fits into many different areas of music and this is so evident in this DVD. You want to see hear and enjoy some just great music listen to this DVD
0385508417|2.0|I found the story predictable - a made-for-TV-movie script - except for the slightly disturbing ending. The Kranks are worried that their daughter is marrying a Peruvian, though their worries are slightly mitigated by the fact that he did his training in London. And, when they meet him, they're relieved to find out &quot;he isn't dark at all!&quot; Phew! Grisham doesn't put this in as a comment on the Kranks but as a genuine aspect of their happy ending. Hmmm... food for thought.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has put out this DVD and her new CD and all you can say is it is just excellent music. She has a stronger voice or at least it sounds so. It sounds clearer and smoother since she took some time off. She sounds like the rest was a good idea and has improved an already excellent voice. If you want to hear excellent songs by a great singer then you need to listen to the CD and watch the DVD.
B00006J3T4|2.0|Hearing Mark Knopfler without Dire Straits is like eating cereal without milk- it's dry and boring.  If Knopfler has such an aversion to playing with his former band he should just retire because he's not doing his career any favors. I gave this cd two stars instead of one because it's decent background music...but that's about it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain has reached the top of her profession and this DVD shows that she is at the very top. One of the most endearing trade marks about Shania that comes through in this DVD is her quailty of being a down to earth real person. One of us so to speak. She shows this in the DVD by the way she acts on stage and how she interacts with the fans. It adds a real friendly quialty that just makes this DVD that much better.
B00003CX5P|1.0|What did you do to the Star Wars I knew, George?
0312263120|2.0|I started reading Dan Brown's books from &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; and &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; was the second one I read.  I have to say it was nothing compared to the first book.<br />Several Reaons why I gave it a low 2-star rating:<br />1. The plot was too simple. Only 2-line development compared to multi-line thriller in Angels and Demons.<br />2. The author wasted too much time on the heroine's love story.  It is necessary for the entire scheme but also seem awkward.  It felt like the author was trying to get many things in at the same time but didn't do it well.<br />3. The heroine is not depicted as a strong or vivid character as advertised in the book's covers or in any novel.  Her role seems pretty weak in the sense that many of her actions/events are not supporting the author's intention of painting her as an extremely intelligent cryptographer (with IQ of 170).  She seems to me just like some pretty girl in a B movie.<br />4. The book touched very little on cryptology in the actual story.  It like Cryptology 101.  It offered less analytical content than I expected.<br />5. Much of the ending was predictible.<br />6. The writing is more like for movie script than for a novel. It's descriptive but not interesting. In all, it seems like some rush work.<br />I have to say Dan Brown can definitely do better than this.
B00005JMF6|2.0|This movie had some real potential, but it was ruined about 2/3 of the way through when the suspense was suddenly turned off. There were some real spooky parts early in the film that had the audience jumping. But once the supernatural parts ended, the movie felt like any other flick. And OOOOOOHHHHHH it was easy to guess whodunit.<br />Another Hollywood disappointment
0385508417|4.0|After careful calculation, Luther and Nora Krank realize they spend approximately $6100 on Christmas each year.  With their only daughter off to Peru via the Peace Corps, they decide to save their money, buy none of the usual trimmings, including gifts, and take a cruise for the holidays.  A great idea until everyone gets all righteous and nosey on them.<br />Sounds like the perfect plan until a few unanticipated curves spin their way.  Their daughter returns unexpectedly with a betrothed and a sick set of neighbors tug on their heart strings.<br />It's no Christmas Carol, but it is a decent holiday Grisham story to while away an afternoon by the fire.  At a mere 177 page you can finish the book some lazy Saturday or Sunday between Thanksgiving and Christmas and put yourself in the holiday mood.<br />Worthy of holiday reading.
B00000099Y|5.0|I love TOOL.Maynard is a genius.I think this is there best album to date.Every single song on here is great.I don't know how anyone could give this cd less than 5 stars.
B00005R1N3|5.0|This film really stands the test of time. Kidder, Hussey and saxon turn in top notch performances and the voice on the other end of the phoen will absolutely send chills down your spine. rarely does a scary film effect me, but I caught this for the 1st time late one night a few years ago and really had a hard time going to sleep. The highlight of the film has to be the lush for a den mother and Claude the cat.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I definely think this was one of the best albums released this year.Maynard is a great musician.&quot;Pet&quot; alone is reason enough to buy this album.It's not Mer de Noms but you shouldn't expect it to be.Maynard and APC are elvolving into a great band.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is the best Chili Peppers album. It is also one of the defining albums of the 1990's. It is a timeless funk alternative rock classic. <BR>Blood Sugar Sex Magik features the 2 best Peppers songs of all time: \\"Give It Away\\" and \\"Under The Bridge\\" as well as several other excellent songs such as \\"Power of Equality,\\" \\"If You Have To Ask,\\" \\"Breaking The Girl,\\" \\"Suck My Kiss,\\" \\"I Could Have Lied,\\" the title track \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" (which I feel is very underrated for a title track) and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy.\\"<BR>All of the other songs are also pretty good except for the cover, \\"They're Red Hot\\" which I find to be annoying.<BR>All in all, this is a must buy if you are a fan of rock music, funk music, or have any taste in music at all.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I thought that this album was really good and brought out the real Britney! I really like Me Against the Music (both versions) because it is such a fun song to party to. (I got that) Boom Boom is also a great song and it features the Ying Yang Twins which adds some rap to the album. Showdown is one of those funky, crazy songs that is so mixed together that it comes out great and is still nice to listen to. Breathe on me is a nice song even though the meaning is not entirely clear... nontheless it is still an interesting song. Early Mornin' is also another great song on the album and is one of those dark, mysterious songs. Toxic is a song that compares with Overprotected. Its fun and actually has good lyrics. Outrageous features a tiny bit of R. Kelly and is a kinda cool party song, with a medium beat. Touch of my hand and the Hook Up are to songs that also have nice beats and very emotional lyrics. While Shadow is a peacful, wanting song, Brave New Girl is funky and upbeat. Everytime is a song that you almost want to cry to because it is so beautiful. I know that other people may have a better voice than Britney, but I feel that Britney has some individual talent and really shows this in her album.
B000060P79|4.0|Just cause these are a bunch of old guys dont mean they are too old.  ur never too old to do anything but yeah some stuff, but singing music that teens can relate to and mean something in their lifes and change them...ur never too old for that.  im very open minded about music and look pac should be 32 right now (not saying hes alive) but he affected all those people around the world with poetry and look at snoop, whatever hes doing, he still has a little bit in him and hes like old ass f**k so iono what these people saying mid 20s r too old cuz u never too old to change lives
B0000TB03W|5.0|&quot;Up&quot; is such a great DVD. Shania moves around the stage interacting with her fans. She sings all her hit songs. You will not want to miss this great DVD.
B000002UTT|5.0|PER GESSLE IS A MUSIC GENIUS - this must be said. The man's songwriting talent is Tremendous. He might have some problems when it comes to Lyrics, but his ability to create a Memorable Melody that people will Love is Tremendous.<BR>He picks up right from where ABBA's Bjorn and Benny left off.<BR> Amd those Combinations of Rock and Dance/Disco work like Magic for Roxette.<br />Infectious Melodies and Hooks that Stick in your Head, is what makes Per's Tunes Truly Unforgettable. And vocals of Marie make these songs Explode (sometimes with Per's Vocal Help).<br />\\"Look Sharp\\" was released in 1988, and contains 13 Unforgettable Hits (\\"13 Thrilling Programmes in one Night\\"). It's too bad they could not release all of them as Singles. They would All go Straight to the Top. There aren't any Fillers here, and the album is like a time-capsule with some of those 80's Saxophone sounds.<br />\\"The Look\\", \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"Listen to your Heart\\" are probably the Best known Songs on this Album. But there are many other songs that are Just as Good (if not Better).<br />The album is So Great, that it's IMPOSSIBLE to Single out any Track in particular. They are all 100% Hits. IMO this Album Leaves any Album by Madonna or Paula Abdul or Prince IN THE DUST, yeah in the Dust (My opinion).<br />While most Tracks are in Dance/Rock style with lots of Energy, there is One Incredible Love Ballad called \\"Cry\\" - it's a Very Beautiful Song.<br />Songs \\"Chances\\" and \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" have soooo Much Passion in them that it hurts. And a Track like \\"Sleeping Single\\", \\"Paint\\" and \\"Dance Away\\" are Dangerously Catchy and Melodic, and you can't help but move to those Guitar Riffs and Synthesizer lines.<br />Roxette's Latest album was called \\"Room Service\\" (2001) and it was just as Great as their other albums. But Unfortunately US Record Companies don't pay any attention to them anymore. I really wish they would.<br />This is a Great Album, from a Legendary Dance/Rock/Pop Group, the kind that only happen once in a Lifetime.<br />Thank You
B0000TB03W|5.0|Chills will run down your back when you hear Shania sing especially on songs like &quot;It Only Hurts When I Breathe&quot;. Shania moves around the stage so much. The best part by far is Shania's interaction with the crowd who sing along to every tune. This dvd offers 105 minutes of sheer pleasure from start to finish.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|The new Christmas album is truly a high point in the band's 35 year career.  Every song has something to offer the listener, from the lovely strains of &quot;Pavane&quot; to the jazzy take on &quot;We Five Kings&quot; to the fantastic new songs &quot;Last Man at the Party&quot; and &quot;First Snow on Brooklyn.&quot;  This is one of those rare albums where every track is strong.  The remakes of old classics are tastefully rendered, and while they don't necessarily improve on the earlier tracks, they are equally tasty in their own way.  The instrumentals are uniformly whimsical and wonderful, and the new tracks are very strong.  This is in my opinion the best Tull album since &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot; in 1987.  Do not hesitate to pick it up and hear some real musicians for a change.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The show opens with a stunning performance of Man! I Feel Like A. Woman! Throughout the show Shania moves around the stage perfectly interacting with her band and working the crowd. If you attended the Chicago show you may just see yourself on the dvd. The show contains a mix of 22 songs classic and new material. What an evening! At the end a Fourth of July style fireworks.
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) is probably one of the best directors of all time. His 1954 film entitled &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (&quot;Shichinin no samurai&quot; in transliterated Japanese) is regarded as one of his best films and is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.  The film is about a small farming village in sixteenth or seventeenth-century Japan that is under threat of repeated attacks from a band of 40 bandits.  Being unable to afford weapons of their own and having little spirit to defend themselves, the villagers seek guidance from their elder, Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo, 1887-1960), who advises them to find several ronin (wandering samurai) to defend the village and who would be willing to work for three square meals per day since that is all the villagers can afford to pay.  Several villagers travel to a nearby city to find willing ronin.  They include Manzo (Kamatari Fujiwara, 1905-1985), Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari, 1894-1971), Mosuke (Yoshio Kosugi, 1903-1968) and Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya).  The first ronin that they find is Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura, 1905-1982), who is accompanied by a young man wanting to become a samurai, Katsushiro Okamoto (Isao Kimura, 1923-1981).  Kambei is not interested at first, but changes his mind when he sees the villagers' desperation.  Kambei and Katsushiro are able to find four more samurai:  the humorous Gorobei Katayama (Yoshio Inaba, 1921-1998), the no-nonsense &amp; highly skilled Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi, 1913-1985), Heihachi Hayashida (Minoru Chiaki, 1917-1999) and Shichiroji (Daisuke Katô, 1910-1975).  Then, there's also the very humorous, samurai-want-to-be named Kikuchiyo (played the world-renowned actor Toshirô Mifune, 1920-1997).   The seven travel back to the village and begin preparations for the coming battle with the bandits, but some of the villagers are afraid of what will happen to their daughters with seven samurai roaming around; especially Manzo, who forces his daughter Shino (Keiko Tsushima)to disguise herself as a boy.<br />Though &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is approximately 206 minutes (nearly 3½ hours) long, it never becomes tiresome.  Instead, the film is very engaging, emotional and powerful as the story develops in large part due to superb acting, exquisite cinematography and the overall realism of the film.  The acting skills of both Takashi Shimura and Toshirô Mifune stand out brilliantly. Toshirô Mifune, who made many other excellent historically based Japanese films, also appeared in many western films including the character of Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto in the 1976 World War II epic &quot;Midway&quot; and the character of Lord Toranaga in the 1980 TV-miniseries adaptation of James Clavell's novel entitled &quot;Shogun&quot;. Memorable scenes in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; include Kambei disguising himself as a priest, Kambei's technique of testing each samurai's reactionary skills, the battle between Kyuzo and the foolish samurai, Manzo disguising Shino, Kikuchiyo's drunkenness, the walk to the village with Kikuchiyo, the arrival at the village, Kambei studying the terrain, Kikuchiyo instructing villagers, the battle scenes and the graveyard scenes.  Other memorable characters in the film include Rikichi's wife (Yukiko Shimazaki) and the bandit chief (Shinpei Takagi, 1902-1967).<br />Overall, I rate Akira Kurosawa's cinematic masterpiece &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; with a resounding 5 of out of 5 stars.  It often brings tears to my eyes each time that I watch the film.  I highly recommend the DVD version of the film to everyone.  Sadly, the DVD is only available in full screen, but that does not detract from Akira Kurosawa's grand vision. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was remade in 1960 as the epic western &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, which starred Yul Bryner, Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson portraying gunfighters instead of samurai.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is fun and loving on this DVD. She gave all she's got and sang her heart out to her fans. She doesn't try hard to impress and carries herself beautifully on her ballads. I love her voice. It just got some strength to it that helps you through things. I love this.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|I would just like to say this is the best work that has come out of britney. Her other albums are good and you like to listen to them.. but this cd is just great, songs have meaning and are just not the same ol pop..Britney keep the hits comming.. and girl you keep changing growth is good. buy the album i totally recomned. it
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is just so awesome that I have to give it 5 stars now! I have watched this DVD like 20 times already since I got it. I love Shania so much. I really look up to her so much. She is such a great role model for anyone. She has such a great personality and musical talent. She really shines in this DVD in so many ways. I love her songs, especially &quot;Still the One.&quot; You will always be the one for me Shania when I need ya!
B000007MVM|5.0|This is a great solo album period. After Syd left/was fired from the Floyd in the late 60's most of the public was hungry for a second helping of the top 40 hits he released from the band and also from the their excellent psychedelic hit album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. Well soon as Syd gathered what was left of his feeble sanity he released this to surprisingly little success and welcome. It was mostly an underground hit, but the Pink Floyd were doing no better with their &quot;soul searching&quot; albums such as &quot;Ummagumma&quot; and &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot;. To be perfectly blunt, most of Pink Floyd(especially Waters)were intimdated by Syd's creative genius(and they do admit it), fearing that his solo works would far outdo their albums as a band. However, Roger Waters and David Gilmour both produced this record, but to listen to it you would never guess it. The sound is brittle and thin, much in contrast to the Floyd's elegant, symphonic sound they often produced. This works out great for the album though, giving it a more mellow, intimate touch that Syd possessed himself. The songs are mostly just Syd with his guitar occassionaly backed up by the Soft Machine to add a litte meat to the over all sound. &quot;Terrapin&quot; is a great opener, a dreamy, almost lazy sounding song concering relationships of love among sea animals. This cut and &quot;Golden Hair&quot; are both the creap of the crop. The latter is Syd performing a poem written by one of his favorite poets James Joyce. Most cite &quot;Dark Globe&quot; as another great track but I cannot listen to it without sadness. The song is like listening to a man croon out his mental illness to the world. Listening as he breaks apart, losing sanity; I skip it most of the time. Other than that this is a great album, but if your expecting something sounding like the Floyd be warned this is Barrett not Pink Floyd and yes their is a rather big difference. This is the Madcap masterpiece!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was always a fan of Britney's older material (Baby One More Time, Oops I Did It Again, Slave), but wasn't surprised to see her switch to a more young adult audience with this album. All the songs are pretty good though some are annoying. <BR>1.) Me Against The Music - the first single off the album - a good dance song 4/5<BR>2.) I've Got That Boom Boom - Not one of my favs. The Britney part sounds cool, but it's shadowed out by the annoying Ying Yang Twins constant rap. 3/5<BR>3.) Showdown - One of my favs on the album. It's got a cool beat that'll get stuck in your head really quickly. 5/5<BR>4.) Breathe On Me - At first, I found this song hard to like. I loved the &quot;breathe on me&quot; chorus, yet I found the rest to slow. After a while of listening to it though, it really starts to relax you, and it's a great dance song for a club. 4/5<BR>5.) Early Mornin' - weird song... cool beat I guess but not one of my favs. - 3/5<BR>6.) Toxic - This reminds me of the old Britney beats - very cool beat and catchy lyrics. Kind of like Stronger - great dance song. 5/5<BR>7.) Outrageous - Interesting beat on this one. Once again another dance beat song. 4/5<BR>8.) Touch of my Hand - One of the more controversial songs on the album (just look at the name of it...) However, it's got a great beat, and I really enjoy this one. 5/5<BR>9.) The Hook Up - Not my fav, but I'm sure a lot of people will get down to its cool beats and funky instrument sounds. 3/5<BR>10.) Shadow - One of the two ballads on the album. It's got a cool beat to it. 4/5<BR>11.) Brave New Girl - REMINDS ME VERY MUCH OF THE OLD &quot;POP&quot; BRITNEY SONGS (not like Hit Me Baby One More Time but more like Thinkin' About You type) Actually, it sounds just like something you'd hear on Hilary Duff's album, Metamorphisis. 4/5<BR>12.) Everytime - The second of two ballads on the album. Britney actually wrote the majority of this track. It speaks some about her breakup with Justin Timberlake. Nice sweet song. 4/5<BR>13.) Me Against The Music Rishi Rich Remix - As the title says, it's a remixed version of Me Against The Music (track 1). It's got a very funky beat to it. Once again, very good at a dance club. 4/5<br />Over all, this is a great addition to the Britney line of albums. Like others have said however, this album is really focused to an older generation than what she's used to targeting at (15+ age wise now instead of the 9 and 10 year olds). Our Britney is growing up!
B000094DUP|5.0|This CD is sensational. Delta is beautiful and has a beautiful voice. All of the tracks are exceptionaly good. My favourites are : Not me, Not I and Predictable. If you havn't already bought this brilliant CD, buy it immediateatley, you will love it. Unfortunatly Delta is being treated for cancer in Australia at the moment. Get well soon, all my thoughts are with you. Delta xxx
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...]Now, forty years later, they finally decided to release the album the way the Beatles wanted it--naked. The Beatles seem to cover every style of music they ever played--from early rock (One After 909) to what sounds like something the lounge singer from SNL would sing (The Long and Winding Road)--but they do it all with the musical sense they had gained from ten hard years of performing and writing. Buy this album, and I guarantee that you'll listen to it so much in the first week that you'll wear out the CD.
0393057658|4.0|I give this book 4 stars because it was a great book to read.  A real pageturner.<BR>However, Lewis missed the biggest reason the A's were and will be successful for a few more years: starting pitching.<BR>The single (or rather three) greatest reason the A's are winners are because of Mulder, Hudson, and Zito.<BR>Take out these 3 players, and all the stats mentioned in the book (on base percentage, slugging, ob plus slugging, etc) are meaningless to winning.  These 3 pitchers consistently kept the A's in the games while their offense patiently waited for the other team's relievers to come out.<BR>How many teams have 3 startes that can give you anywhere between 15-20 wins a season.  Many teams have 2, but probably only Yankess can match that capability (but not after this season, as they'll lose the Rocket, Wells, and probably Pettite).<BR>I was only somewhat surprised the A's haven't gotten further in the playoffs the past few seasons.  It's almost always the case the teams with strong pitching wins out in the playoffs.  <BR>I took a look at the A's team stats for year 2003, and they were in the bottom third in the key stats mentioned in the books (OB, Slugging, BB, etc)<br />Also, I would liked to have more info on exactly why Billy Bean failed as a big leager.  How did he hit over .500 as a junior in high school, then plummet down to .300's in his senior season?  Why was he never able to adjust to minor and major league pitching?  Book mentioned his mental weakness as well as &quot;every pitcher having a slider&quot;.   But if he was such a gifted athlete, he should have been adjusted and learned to his major league pitching.<br />So will we see a trend in current GM's being replaced by Harvard grads with a knack for statistics and scoring models?  I don't think anytime soon, althought it is, for me, a refreshing change of order in baseball from old-timers to new faces with modern ideas.<br />So while my tone in the review might seem negative, I gave it high markssince I enjoyed reading it.  I didn't necessarily agree with everything in the book, but objectively, it was a fun book to read with few insights into the game I never realized before.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|You guys need to stop comparing britney and christina.....everybody knows that they are different artists....at the beggining they were kinda the same , but now they are totally different ...yes christina has a better voice.... but she yells to much.... i got tired of it...in the other hand britney's voice is softer ....i like her better. <BR>the IN THE ZONE songs are great.....i dont know why some people say that the songs suck....i think you should buy the cd ....there will be a song you like.....
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|A previous review stated the difference between the International &amp; US soundtrack, so I bought the International version...it is really a great cd &amp; the US one is missing some of the great tracks from the movie that the international version posseses.... A really fantastic soundtrack that really brings back each scene in your head &amp; leaves you with that same happy feeling from the movie...
0743455967|5.0|Mr. Kings book is the best I have ever read in down to earth advice on writing. The myriad of books available are swallowed by this one down to earth advisory. He explains in vivid detail the basics needed for good writing and the importance of continual habitual reading to improve your abilities. I will always keep this book with all underlined of his great advise. If you desire to write in any genre be sure to study this book.
B000089RVR|5.0|Great cd in true Dido fashion. If you liked No Angel, this cd will not dissapoint. I listen to this cd all of the time.
B000083EMR|5.0|saw the BAND in London 70s,after getting  BIG PINK  got LAST WALTZ  And continued to be amazed then along comes the DVD  Audio  they styarted a new beginning and this just keeps it going.......<BR>BRILLIANT <BR>thanks robbie.levon/rick/garth<BR>richard<BR> missed by many those who have gone<br />ASH
B0000C6E4D|5.0|At first I was not impressed with the cd as I felt it was similar to her older work, but after listening to it more &amp; more I feel it is a great cd- just as haunting &amp; beautiful as before. A cd I can pop in to relax &amp; unwind, etc.
B000060P79|4.0|These pop-punk Canadian rockers are awesome! They capture the teen anger. Hating your parents, missing a loved one, CHRISTMAS!!!, and a lot more! I promise you that you'll be singing along to these catchy songs! &quot;My Alien&quot; is a hilarious song! (I think the title gives you a bit of a hint.)<br />No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls includes the 3 singles &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot;, &quot;Addicted&quot;, and &quot;Perfect&quot;. <br />Don't forget to listen to the VERY end of the CD. It has a bonus track at the end of Track 13! And remember to put it in your CD-ROM to get the special enhanced features!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 is an amazing film. It is filled with contant action that will leave you on the edge of your seat. You do not necessarily have to be an X-men fan to enjoy the movie. However, die hard fans will enjoy the cameo's by such characters as Beast, Gambit, Siren and Shadowcat, as well as the increased role of Jubilee, Colossus and Iceman. I highly reccomend this DVD.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I have never heard a cd as beautiful as this. I have also never heard a voice as intreging and as hypnotic as Jonsi's. It simply carries you off the ground into a place you've never been before. A place not quite like anywhere on this planet. It simply moves you beyond belief.<br />Another thing that stands out is how their is nothing on the cover or inside the book. This cd is simply about one thing. THE MUSIC. And they succede very well and making music like no other band on this planet.<br />Standout songs: 1,3,4,6,8.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Ok, where to start? First of all, all you 1 star rating fans! How could anyone say that this one deserves less than 4 stars? Please re-insert the CD and listen to it again and again. <BR>This by far is my favorite (Awake a very close second).<BR>From the moment it started it sucked me in. Very few albums (CD's) have ever made me feel so engulfed that I can't stop listening. The emotions are dark but yet enlightening. The power that they project is mind blowing. And for some to say that this one reminds them of Metallica, Pantera, or Joe Satriani are sorely mistaken. I only wished that Metallica or Pantera had DT's talent or are as diverse. How could you even compare? <BR>I admit that, \\"As I Am\\" has a little more commercial appeal. That last time they ever really tried to do that is with \\"Pull Me Under\\", and it worked. I hope that it does get more radio play. DT deserves it. <BR>This one comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone new or old to Dream Theater.<BR>Great job Guys!!!!
B00005OAIE|2.0|I was really hyped to get this CD, I've always loved John Mayer and Room For Squares is one of my all time favorite CDs. His voice is fabulous. But, when my boyfriend finally bought it for me, it was only mediocre. Room For Squares had an even number of slow songs and HAPPY upbeat songs. Heavier Things just seems like kind of a slow drawn out disc. Bigger Than My Body is wonderful, but I wasn't really able to get into the other songs. They were just really slow.
0897500482|5.0|This is the best book i have ever read on the subject of combat ( not sparring ore competition ) the book gives you a guidet to the thaugts and mind of a great master of realistic hand to hand coombat. Lee was one of the first to realize that in order to train for the street you had to go all out everything goes and free your mind from styl-thinking, for instance developing qualities in all the different ranges of fighting ( kicking range, punching range, trapping, grappling...). You have to adapt no style as style and have no limitations whatsoever. I find this to be a very good guide for advanced students. I first bought this book 15 years ago, and did not understand much other than some of the foreword. Having practiced martial arts and selfdefense for the last ten years i now start to understand the tremendus insight and depht of this work. A must read for everyone wawnting to make sure that they train to survive outside of the ring as well as inside.
0385504209|5.0|This was the best book I have read in years!  Educating and exciting. Didn't want it to end.  Would highly recommend this book!
B00005MAM2|5.0|I was trying to eat a bowl of soup at the beginning of the movie, but by five minutes into it I had to stop with the soup to direct all my attention on the movie.  The graphics, the violence, even the rape scene, I loved every single bit of it, and I am the one who tells people to watch their language.  It's so great.  The whole time I was watching it I had my nails in my cheeks.  I am normally very critical of dubbed movies, but even that was good to me(maybe I was too caught up in the story to notice if it was bad).  The storyline was awesome.  You think you can predict what is going on halfway through, but by the end you are left dumbstruck.  I am the type of person to interpret something really easy, but this I don't think I will ever be able to grasp.  It's such a fast-paced movie with a super-deep, super-intelligent storyline.  One of the rare animes I think is really worth the hype-- no wait, the hype doesn't ever catch up to this!
0792846303|5.0|This movie is BY FAR John Carpenter's best effort.  This is a &quot;scary movie&quot; that is unusually well-written.  The storyline is clear and things fall into place nicely.  I place this movie easily in the top 3 of my all-time favorite horror flicks.  Too bad Carpenter is more known for (the very good) Halloween.  Hooray for John Carpenter!!!
B00008DDSC|4.0|The Secretary alternately shocks and surprises us with its unusual subject matter and intense approach to its off-beat subject.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee Holloway, a young girl just released from a mental institution who is determined to get a job.  She notices a sign posted outside a lawyer's office for a secretary.  As she enters the office she watches the former holder of this job leaving in tears.  She then introduces herself to Mr. Grey, the lawyer, ably played by James Spader.  Mr. Grey's office is the first clue that something unusual is in store for her.  Rare flowers are beautifully showcased in an exotic setting.  Additionally, the lawyer appears to have a fetish for neatness.  He quickly removes from sight a row of carefully arranged markers.<br />Lee gets the job and begins her initiation into a new world of strange and bizarre behavior.  Lee has a habit of punishing herself for real and imagined faults.  We watch her in the bathroom of her home cutting herself.  She has scars all over her body from past abuse.  She soon begins to cut herself in the office and is noticed by her boss.  At first he says nothing, but when she makes a variety of errors on the reports she is assigned to type, he yells at her and then takes sterner measures.  He tells her to come into his office and then demands that she lean over his desk and place her palms on the desk surface.  She complies and is spanked by the the lawyer.  She submits to this indignity and even seems to like it.  Lawyer and secretary enter into a relationship which allows each to satisfy their deep need to hurt and be hurt.<br />The secretary falls in love with her boss and tells him so.  He is unable to respond to her affections and fires her.  Like Bartelby the Scrivener, she prefers not to be fired and visits him at his home and then takes up residence in the office.  She comes to the attention of the media who publicize her unusual actions. The relationship between lawyer and secretary improves and deepens when he observes her commitment to him.  The climax of the film is both unexpected and original, as is the entire movie.<br />For those new to the sado/masochistic world, this film is disturbing, yet fascinating.  What motivates these people to act as they do?  The movie does not answer this perplexing question.  Instead, it allows us to draw our own conclusions as we watch each new development in the story.  For those willing to suspend the first inclination to judge the lawyer and secretary as just plain crazy, a deepening understanding of the variety of human experience reveals itself.  We observe the various ways these people respond to the pain they suffer in their lives.<br />The limited spectrum of what we believe to be normal behavior is stretched considerably with each new development of the story.  I was reminded of The Piano Teacher, a much better film on this subject of sado/masochism that I reviewed some months ago.  The Secretary is not up to the high standard of The Piano Teacher, but still worth recommending.deepens when he observes her commitment to him.

079284632X|1.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of distubing, thriller type movies.  Unfortunately, this movie (I use the term loosely) was a terrible waste of my time.  The plot is pretty good (but very implausible), but the story jumps around to the point of being ridiculous.  Scary, dramatic  Absolutely not--this movie is pure garbage and what a disappointment.  Luckily, Wes has gotten better over time.
6304806418|4.0|This is a beautiful movie, with an awesome acting by Madonna and Antonio Banderas. Both are wonderful! I would say it is not 5 stars because there are some parts of the history (details) of Evita that are missing. That's why I recommend in addition to the movie the reading of &quot;Santa Evita&quot; by Tom&aacute;s Eloy Mart&iacute;nez (the Spanish original or the English translation by Helen Lane).<br />Anyway, the movie is wonderful, and I think it puts Evita where it should be (that's why Antonio Banderas is wonderful). This is one of the few musical movies I really like. You would also enjoy the 2CD's set &quot;Evita. The complete motion picture music soundtrack&quot;.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Whether you like it or not, Britney is here to stay. People I talk to say they hate Britney because she is annoying and fake. But is she doing anything dangerous? NO! She's harmless. The more you bash her, the more publicity she gets and the more she stays in the public eye. Why does music have to always be &quot;deep&quot;? I love all that meaningful music as much as the next guy but sometimes I just don't feel like sitting there and trying to decipher the lyrics and the meaning of life. Sometimes I just want something fun to listen to!  Now let's talk about her new cd. I think it's great - I'd rather listen to this than Oops! or Britney although I love those albums too. But Britney is growing up and she can't have the same BOMT album over and over. I love all the songs, espcially Breathe on Me, Toxic, Showdown, Outrageous, Everytime, and Brave New Girl. I wouldn't say this album is ground breaking. She even admits she is not a great singer. But she's a great entertainer, respectful to those around her [unlike certain singers that start with the letter C and rhymes with hristina but that's another story] and works extremely hard at it. When I see Britney on tv, she's so down-to-earth, like she's my ditzy but lovable sister. Give her cd a chance!
0316666343|1.0|If you want to read a poorly organized book with stock characters, and dangling story lines, then this is the book for you!  <br />I had the opportunity to read this book with my book club, and we all agreed it was poorly written.  The characters are one-dimensional and not credible.  I understand that the story is quite fantastic and incredible, but that does not mean the characters should be so  unbelievable.  I didn't find any of the characters &quot;real&quot;, not Ruth, Lindsey or Samuel...  to name a few!  I am sure this is not the way real people act, even when placed in such an awful situation of a young girl's murder.<br />There were &quot;dangling elements&quot; in the story that the author never tied up and finished properly.  It was as though she wasn't entirely sure how to end the book so she left all kinds of story lines open.  This is indeed the sign of a poorly written book!  Why did Ruth start out liking girls?   Then all of a sudden she didn't?  Why did Ruana say she would &quot;start with Ruth...&quot;? These are only a few of the many questions I have.<br />From a forensics, and crime investigation point of view, this book also falls short.  I do understand that the book starts out in the 1970's, but I still think that a criminal investigation conducted then would have been much more thorough.  I mean, the murderer lived right in the neighborhood of the girl - I would think the police would have at least investigated close to home.<br />Lastly, although the book struggles along the whole way, with choppy bits, and pointless story lines not contributing to anything in the end, there is a major event that happens in the end (I won't give the end away!) that is just too much!  This is a very poor ending!  If Susie Salmon was in heaven, and she didn't really have any relationships or challenges to overcome, how is it that she was able to mature and evolve? You could point out an endless list of impossibilities like this - and yes I understand that itis just the author's interpretation of heaven.  It's just I really think you need people and situations to develop and grow as a human being, not just &quot;fluffy&quot; heaven that is like high school , and presents no opportunities for personal growth.<br />It was a very frustrating read overall, and I am desperately trying to get rid of my copy!  Save your money for another book!

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is outstanding... what a voice. What a show she put on.<BR>And I think the Title &quot;She's not just a pretty face&quot; says it all. She is truly a great artist. Can't wait to see her again.<BR>Continued success Shania!
B00005U11Z|4.0|The concert itself is outstanding and I love the sound quality.  But there were no bonus features, no interviews, no videos, no nothing, so therefore it gets 4 stars instead of 5.

B00005JMCW|5.0|Freaky Friday is like the perfect family movie of 2003. I went with one of my freinds, and we were laughing throughout the whole entire movie. That would be heck a weird to be in your mom's body and vise versa. This movie I think deserves a grammy.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I am in love with Shania. This woman never ceases to amaze me. This dvd is packed with great songs and performances. Shania sings live so well and she is surely a diva of her own status. You will love this dvd.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This girl makes me wanna barf. If you feel like you need to barf, listen to this. Also why do people worship this beotch. She has clearly no talent, and she is heck a ugly! She's just a broken blender trying to sing. I don't know about you but someone should just give her a lethal injection. She clearly, Clearly has no talent. And if I could I would giver her infinity below 0! Like I said, someone just kill this B****!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Good dvd that is so worth getting. If you are slightly exposed to Shania, then you will love this dvd. It will draw you closer to her music and great personality that shines through in this dvd. I love it!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This amazing new album from `Nickelback' has been what feels like a long time coming to many of their fans. But is has been well worth the wait! Oh! Yeah!<BR>We are treated to tunes heavier that we are used to from the rocking Canadians. Right through the album the tone changes constantly and is balanced to perfection from rock to metal and more deep, dark lyrics from Chad Kroeger. Some fantastic dirty rock n' roll guitar riffs punctuate the songs and Nik's drumming is definitely much more apparent. Chad's melodious 'growl' is ever present and full of emotion and integrity. <BR>Listen to it in the car where you can krank up the volume, get singing with Chad and rock your socks off!!<BR>If you love rock and roll, you will love this!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Great music that you can enjoy anyday. It has a great sound and the visual is cool too. Everytime I watch it, I see things that I did not realize before. This is a good dvd.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The last person who reviewed Pet Sounds entitled his review \\"Masterpiece?\\" and gave it 1 star.  He's entitled to his opinion, though I'm not one to agree with it.  Even Mike Love had his skepticism when he 1st heard the instrumental tracks to Pet Sounds.    Brian Wilson had retired from touring in 1965, due to emotional problems and pressure to write and compose more for the Beach Boys.  Though many missed his presence onstage, this allowed him to really get out the sounds inside his brain.  He was especially impressed with the craftmanship of the Beatles' Rubber Soul, which came out around Christmas of that year.  Long story short, while Brian's brothers Carl and Dennis, Mike Love, Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston were busy touring the world from 1965-66, Brian composed and performed on the instrumental tracks, reducing the band to backup singers.    \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" opens the album with promise and optimism, and a jaunty koto solo, sounding much like a young man bent on making his romantic dreams come true (Dennis can be heard singing backup with \\"cupped hands\\" over his mouth).  \\"You Still Believe In Me\\" came from an earlier song \\"In My Childhood\\" and featured the sounds of a bicycle bell and a car horn from the song \\"Childhood.\\"  Mike sings lead on \\"That's Not Me.\\"  \\"Don't Talk\\" is both haunting and romantic with its strings and the bass which sounds like a beating heart.  \\"I'm Waiting For the Day\\" has lyrics about a man hopeful to help a woman forget about the last jerk who broke her heart.  This piece is heavy on the drums (particularly in the intro and at the false ending) and woodwinds (oboe accompanying the verses and flutes soloing at the last verse).  \\"Let's Go Away For a Little While\\" sounds like it could be during a romance scene in any 1960's movie, with vibes, strings, a sax and a slide guitar.  \\"Sloop John B\\" is a traditional folk song (it was Al's idea that they record this in 1965).  Carl sings lead on the ethereal \\"God Only Knows,\\" which Brian got the idea from praying.  Cynical Mike retorted \\"Well, I pray to God it sells!\\"  Orchestration includes strings, french horns, accordian and harpsichord (one take includes a sax solo).  \\"I Know There's An Answer\\" was originally \\"Hold Onto Your Ego\\" (Mike's condition for singing on it was that the lyrics were more optimistic sounding).  Mike sings lead on \\"Here Today\\" (one of the more commercial pieces).  \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" is Brian being brutally honest about the struggle inside himself (if you've ever thought to yourself \\"Nobody understands me,\\" you're sure to relate).  This features an eerie theramin solo amidst the heartbreaking melody.  The instrumental title track \\"Pet Sounds\\" cheers things up a bit.  Finally, there's one of the saddest breakup songs ever \\"Caroline, No.\\"  Brian laments the warmth and sweetness in Caroline have disappeared forever.  At the end, you hear the sound of a train and Brian's dogs barking.    Pet Sounds may not have sold well when 1st released but has earned crtical acclaim and the right to be known as a masterpiece.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain does it again, comes out of nowhere and blows you away from the Windy City itself...Chicago! Shania puts on a thrilling &amp; entertaining performance that's full of intense energy. What's great about it, is the crowd is so involved with the show, everyone is singing the words to her songs like only true fans could. If you don't have this DVD yet, you have to get it, and treat yourself to her New Album too!
076790382X|3.0|The book is not bad, but it's not what I expected.  <br />I was expecting a book having a lot more to do with the culture differences between America and the UK.  A book discussing the small differences in daily life, kind of what you get when you see a nice foreign movie.  One of those where you relish the scenes of the character just going to the corner store.  <br />Instead it deals much more with a nostaltgia for what has changed for the writer in the last 20 years.  It seems to languish in this nostalgia with only an occasional foray into the differences in modern daily life. (Like a visit to the post office and how these compare)<br />I actually got this at a bookstore after only briefly reading the back cover and leafing a few pages.  I would have to say that reading reviews here before buying does work better.  I guess thats why I wrote this review.

B00008DDXC|2.0|THERE'S just something slightly disturbing about seeing teens whizzing through the air on broomsticks ...... not quite fitting - something Pasolini might have invented..... then there's the \\"Magic\\", and the violence at school?  Just what are we telling the younguns here?  Not as if this is Lindsay Anderson's \\"IF\\" ... but close, close.<br />Most of this is quite a tangle between seemingly good and evil, but for the audience?  Who the heck knows?  The effects are great - better than the first - but this one's overlong - especially the spider sequence - just goes on and on and on.<br />The ghost in the lavatory is quite fun though .... brings quite a chill back from childhood... something about a deserted school lavatory and a cold seat ....<br />Maggie Smith still sems to be one beat away from Jean Brodie [the very affected 1930 pronunciation], poor, brilliant, Richard Harris is just plain ill, Branagh is  ... Liberace?<br />Only Alan Rickman - semi-asexual - delivers well, and the youth playing Tom Riddle ... great find hope to see him back.<br />Just wonder what this one's all about<br />NOW something about Crowley starring Hopkins could be rather piquant .....
B00005JMFI|4.0|This movie was actully much better than I expected...<br />But the funniest line, I can't remember the exact line, but a children book writer was talking about a family of asparagus who went to the doctor, complaining that their pee smelled funny...<br />I know in writing, it dosen't sound too terribly funny, but it had me chocking on root beer in the theater.
0743216458|5.0|I would recomend reading the book before seeing the miniseries. Even though both are very very good. The book tells the stories of Easy Company in world war II.They begin in the united states for training then are gone to britain and eventually to the dday jump in 1944. this book shows the coming together of ordinary men. by the end of the war they know everything about each other. i would like to thank ambrose and all of the e company soldiers that helped put this book and eventually this miniseries on dvd which i have for making them. just think this is just one company's doing in world war II. imagine all the other hundreds of companies there are.Curahee
B0000DD7LB|4.0|&quot;All my people in the crowd, grab a partner take it down&quot; Although these opening lyrics to In The Zone may sound to common, dont let these 'bubblegum' lyrics fool you. The First four tracks are promosing. Stand out tracks include &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; which is one of the best Britney songs to date. The trip hop vibe is so addicting that who have to put it on repeat. Toxic has the most amazing string arrangements I've heard in a while. Touch Of My Hand is by far the best song on the album. Shadow, Brave New Girl, Everytime, and Showdown are other album highlights as well. The Hook Up, Outrageous, and Early Mornin' are songs that the album could most definately live with out. Ultimately, Britney's growth/maturity shows up on this album making the CD as a whole, enjoyable to liste too.~~~ 3 and 1/2 stars-- B+
B0000AXE8I|2.0|What happend? The first Matrix was such a good/original movie and I thought the 2nd film would totally live up to the first. I was totally wrong not to mention letdown. In the years since the first everyone has been able to pull off the Matrix type stunts from movies like Scary Movie to video games like Max Payne. Reloaded was supposed to take it a step higher and blwo our minds again with hard to pull off fight scenes like we've never seen before. Sadly the fights were re-hashed from the first film and the movie suffered from wooden dialouge and way too much cgi. This movie seemed like it also suffered from the post Columbine sindrome. The first was widley debated as holding a impact on that tragedy (as was everything else) and while the first one seemed much more violent this one's violence was more cartoon-ish. Sure some of the special effects in this movie are great (the car chase scene is cool but not mind blowing and like most fight scenes were featured in the trailers). The acting is a huge step down. Keanau (who has never been able to act though was decent in the first except for a little gem called The Gift, which he's great in) really makes this film almost unwatchable (as does the laughable rave scene and the so called deep but ever so boring plot and dialouge that seems to get much more screen time than the action does).<br />I have yet to see Revolutions and from the looks of it they wasted alot more money on cheep looking CGI and once again didn't break any new ground with the action. The first movie deserved the hype for those thinking that Reloaded is a good movie probably are walking around their local malls every weekend dressed up like Neo and his gang thinking they are cool and different yet they come off looking as a joke and are nothing new nor are they anywhere near being original
B0000CFW87|4.0|If you are reading this review, i would like you to know that i am open to every type of music ever created, from classical to hard rock...Here is my honest review~ With someone with such a compeling voice as Mr. Groban, it would be a shame to see his voice get lost through boring arrangements and bad production. Luckily, Groban only excels through his haunting string arangements,which especially stand out on songs such as, &quot;All Improvviso Amore&quot; and &quot;Oceano&quot;. All of his songs are bound to make you heart skip numerous beats, and his voice will be destined to give you chills, noteably on the spine-tingles inducing track, &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;. Listeners be aware that there are some tracks that can provoke the album to be a little to redundant, but, there is enough of a variety in between to keep the listeners interested to this majestic album. The italian songs stand out much more than english, except for the beautifully done &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;. Although not a complete masterpiece, Groban brings listeners an exceptional well-worth owning CD that will keep fans anticipating his next...
B00005JM0B|3.0|I'm such a huge Schwarzenegger fan and a fan of the first two Teminator movies that I was so looking forward to this. My expectations were not high at all going in basically because this already didn't feel like a Terminator movie (no Cameron, no Hamilton, no Furlong etc). Sure Arnie was back but I was actually amazed at how little screen time he got in this movie. Nick Stahl is a good actor but he just didn't make me believe that he was John Connor. I'm not to big on actors being replaced in films like this (it would kinda suck if Arnie was replaced with someone supposed to be him). Clarie Danes character was ok but got annoying at times. She made you miss Linda Hamilton that much more. The T-X was pretty cool though no where near as cool as the T-1000.<br />It was nice to see characters like this back after a 11 year abscene but sadly it wasn't the same. It was like showing up to a reunion but someone was standing in for the people you went to school with. I did like the ending of this movie and hope that if they do make a 4th (and it looks like they might)it will be set in the future. Arnie wouldn't be needed thing (and it looks like he might not have the time to make a 4th one now)but a 4th Terminator without any of the actors from any of the other films would be really odd to watch. Maybe someday soon James Cameron will return and make one final Terminator movie (i'd much rather have that than True Lies 2).
B000024CVF|5.0|There was one track of hers on a Celtic Chillout collection. It was The Mummers' Dance, an extraordinary track, and on the strength of that, I bought The Book Of Secrets. What a find - the whole album is extraordinary.<br />There is so much to write about this album that if I tried to express everything I wanted to say, I would lose myself in an ever-decreasing spiral. Let's just say that Ms McKennitt has a very beautiful and original voice, the subjects of her compositions are varied to say the least - you seem to be taken on a mystical journey, a bit like reading Lord Of The Rings in a day. However, there are lots of influences which show themselves in the lyrics and the melodies; the musicianship is truly masterful and she has produced a near-perfect album.<br />One reviewer of her music suggested that it should be experienced whilst having sex. I think I would rather pay attention to her first and keep my partner waiting .....!<br />This is an exemplary album and a good way to get into Ms McKennitts brand of Celtic music - as I have. One can only wonder why it has taken me so long to find out about her.
0553573403|4.0|The characters are well drawn (the men are more three-dimensional than the women).  I feel as though I'd recognize them if we met, and I'd like to talk to them.  The plot is shaped by the characters' interactions, does not seem to be going anywhere, but the interactions are interesting.
0395389496|5.0|I am now seventeen years old, but I first read this book when I was very young, and it, amoung other various children's books from Dr. Suess, and others, is what inspired me to want to write chrildren's books someday.  This is a goal that I am still aiming for, and everytime I read The Polar Express, I get inspired once again.  It is simply magical...timeless in it's wonderful illustrations and it's childlike joy.  I am most positive in saying that it is impossible that you could not like this book...whatever age you might be.  Afterall, the real goal of Children's books is not just to inspire the children, but to remind us all about our own childhoods.  You can not be disappointed with this book.  Buy for your children, and you are insuring that someday, they will be buying it for theirs.
B0000C8AUO|5.0|when I first heard Reality, I was all &quot;oh great, another album where Bowie is going through the motions&quot;, but I kept bringing myself back to it, and after about 10 listens, I can say I think this is easily Bowie's best album since Earthling, and possibly the best since Let's Dance (yes, Let's Dance gets bashed a lot, but in terms of a pop album, it was classic).<br />New Killer Star was a great single choice, it will never get top 40 airplay in the face of all the rap and wannabe-punk that contaminates airwaves. But the song rocks and is weirdly catchy. Other fave songs include the rocky &quot;Never Get Old&quot;, the alt-ish &quot;Looking For Water&quot;, but the surprising highlights in my book are the two &quot;torchy&quot; slow songs. &quot;Bring Me The Disco King&quot; is a great poignant look at how the 70's had a lot of excess, and &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot; is a very pretty arrangement.<br />Try it out, I think the album will at least get one or two Grammy nominations
B000003KCU|5.0|I've read a couple of reviews on this movie that talk about the acting, or the costumes, or the directors, or the cast, and even comparing it with other movies for older audiences. I saw this movie when I was a kid when it first came out, and another 50 times throughout the years, and that's exactly who this movie is for, kids. This movie gets the imagination going and leaves the younger audience with a good feeling after watching it that will last though the ages. I remember wanting to be one of those kids and a few times I may have even dreamt that I was working late at night on the &quot;Thunder Road&quot;. That's more than enough for me. I can safely say that the movie ranks right up there with &quot;Goonies&quot;, &quot;Solar Babies&quot;, the recent &quot;Hook&quot;, and other adventure/fiction films that never grow old. Those with the imagination of youth will enjoy this movie and it's a shame the DVD conversion has not happened yet.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is a great insight into Paul McCartney's version of the Beatles. There's no way you can call this &quot;The way The Beatles wanted it to be&quot; because let's face it, John and George aren't around to put their stamp of approval on anything anymore. Maybe Ringo will release his version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; next.<br />But that said, this is a *great* album. I am an avid Beatles fan, and I cherished the scraps alternative takes that the Anthology CDs gave us, and here's an entire album reworked into a new interpretation. Great for Beatles fans who will actually notice the changes. But for the casual Beatles listner, buy one or the other because if you're not really familiar with these songs already, you probablly won't realize the extent to which things have changed.<br />The bonus disc is interesting, but don't expect any amazing revalations here.
B00006X06U|4.0|I don't consider myself well versed in Joni Mitchell.  A girl I knew in college did have copies of 'Blue' and 'For the Roses' which I heard incidentally.  And I did own a vinyl of 'Court and Spark' (I'm sure THAT makes me unique...) and for some reason, 'Hejira' (I think it was one of my 12 free records when I joined the Columbia Record Club).  Though I always respected her musicianship and status, along with Joan Baez and Judy Collins, as one of the few female founders of folk (The Four-F Club), I never grew a Joni jones.  In fact, the copy of 'Travelogue' I am reviewing here jumped out at me from a shelf at my local library.<br />I suppose it is something of a \\"Best of...\\" Joni, although the songs are re-recorded to orchestral arrangements.  In that sense, it is also something of a 'Let It Be -- Naked' in reverse, with Joni adding layers rather than taking them away.  Some work better than others, though I'm not familiar with all the originals, but overall it is a (generally) soothing and graceful work.  <br />It is rather striking to me that so many people here would pan this work with one or two stars.  (I suppose THEY can do better?).   The quality of the compositions alone warrant at least 3 stars.  I'm not a freak for mass collections of strings and horns, and certainly Joni's music works better (for me, anyway) on a lone acoustic guitar or piano, but 'Travelogue' offers new perspectives on some old dialogs, which is refreshing (certainly better than a live 'rehash').  It's much like traveling to a beloved destination, but choosing a different route just for the heck of it, even if it is out of the way.  You still get to where you wanted to go, but you feel you've discovered something new in the process of getting there.  I suppose in the final analysis the strings and brass don't give or take away a lot from these compositions, but that is more of a credit to what they are than a criticism of whatever Joni was trying to make of them.<br />I do like how 'Woodstock' fared in the overhaul.  Consider that this take actually brings a contemporary feel to a song dated not only by years, but also by decades of cultural change.  Others, like 'Circle Game' and 'Refuge of the Roads' will forever remain treasures, no matter how Mitchell reinterprets them.  I also enjoyed getting acquainted with compositions I was unfamiliar with, such as 'Sex Kills', a daunting tune.<br />I must confess that at times I have no idea what Mitchell is singing about, but it always seems interesting, and there are many moments when her lyrics, or 'way' of looking at or expressing something make me smile at her insight or style.  Is she a musical genius?  I don't know, and I don't care.  This is.  And this is good.  I would still buy the originals over this, but this is nice, too.  It's 4 stars, folks... put away your prejudices, both good and bad.
B000068OSK|4.0|The White Stripes' debut is probably the most badly produced, great album out there, but that's what sets it apart from most of the albums I've heard lately.  The enormous amount of reverb and grainy vocals made me feel like I was listening to a 60's Vinyl Album.<br />  This is defenitely The White Stripes' best album.  It's got the most energy of any of their albums that I've listened to, with songs like Jimmy the Exploder, Broken Bricks, and Screwdriver.  It also has the most soul of any White Stripes' album with tracks like Wasting My Time and I Fought Piranhas. <BR>  <BR>  The simplicity of just the drums and guitar really works on this album.  It's a real breath of fresh air, after listening to the complicated epics Pink Floyd and Yes.  Still, none of the other White Stripes' albums seem to pull it off as well.  <BR>  <BR>  This album is really great, but I can't give it 5 stars after I just listened to Bob Dylan.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|If you didn't like the CD, tell us about how bad it was not how Britney wears less clothes and how you lose respect for her and all that crap.<BR>And you don't need to have the best voice in the world to be a singer. If she was that a crappy singer, she wouldn't be that famous and wouldn't have sold 60 million.<BR>Ok the Cd's not the best and it does show her weak voice but she's grown up so much and it's real good for Britney though its a slight disappointment from her previous albums.<BR>Everyone'so intent on comparing her to Christina. So what if she's got a better voice? Should she be the only singer in the universe becuase of that and those who don't don't have the best voice not be a singer?<BR>Everyone's got this crappy attitude about britney and I think she's putting in some great stuff right now. <BR>I can't believe I bought Christina's albums becuase I kept reading about how she's better than britney. They're absolute losers (except voice and lyrics) compared to britney's first three albums<BR>In the Zone is a great dance CD with great hip hop numbers and two amazing ballads. I recommend you to buy it.

0812548094|4.0|Stone of Tears does not equal up to Wizard's First Rule, I'm afraid. Terry Goodkind should have stuck with his first book and left it with his happy ending, then started a new book. However, if you are reading this review, you're probably going to read 'Stone' anyway. I won't spoil anything, but I will tell you that all the scenes from Wizard's First Rule that made you want to cry and vomit at the same time (especially scenes with Denna) are gone. Many of the feel-good scenes with Richard and Kahlan are gone as well. They are separated early in the book and not reunited at the end, so the ending is not necessarily a happy one, unlike its predecessor. Plus, characters you came to know and love like Chase and Rachael are gone by the 100th page. But that ends up being reasonable, because there are also newbies like Gratch the gar who you come to love just as much.<BR>   Though I've pretty much slammed the book at this point, it is a good read. There is more magic and less swords than the last, so you can judge that individually by which you prefer. My only problem with 'Stone' is that it isn't as good as the first.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Well, I never really dug many facets of the original l.p.: the pretentious liner notes (for a supposed &quot;back to the roots&quot; album); the snippets of non-musical recording session sounds); short takes of music which could have been longer takes; the terrible track order; the use of an inferior [to the 45 rpm version) guitar break - why couldn't Spector find another vocal take in that case?<BR>All that stuff has been fixed for this release. Although &quot;Two Of Us&quot; should have been Track Two and &quot;One After 909&quot; should have been the closer. (Like in the old days when &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; or &quot;I'm Down&quot; closed their concerts). <BR>Regarding the much-discussed post-over-production by PS: &quot;Across The Universe&quot; was absolutely beautiful back in '70; &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; is better stripped down (as PM intended it, right?) - the newly offered vocal is more impressive; &quot;Let It Be&quot; was a masterpiece as a hit single, so this previously unreleased take is certainly worth having but doesn't compare.<BR>I'm glad to have this CD. I'll refer to the first one for purposes of nostalgia on Sunday afternoons. But, to me, the ultimate package would be the Glyn Johns *original* original - reportedly called &quot;The Beatles' Get Back&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|This book is not the first with this story that I read, The Prophetess by Barbara Wood is alike but I think that this book is better, whether if you are agree or not with this story, this book will keep you reading all the time and you won't be able to put it down.<br />I can't tell you that this story ia real or not, but you really can? May be you will not be agree with this story, (I am not telling that I am, but I'm not telling you that I'm not) but you have to know what other people think about any religion and<br />think about it. This book is amazing in the things of the past, and what really happened 2,000 years ago is very difficult to verify, I think that this book deserves SIX STARS because is a book that will make you think, and as I said before, is not the first one with this theme, so the question is: why other writers wanted to do this job if it is not true?
B00004WEJZ|2.0|Sean Connery still has its charm, but he seems more like the aging high school football hero who has to live in the memory of his past glory. This film is a remake of the 1965 Bond film Thunderball. The original movie was much better in every way. The music in this film is very poor, the acting is mediocre and quite honestly the movie is way too long and dull. The changes made in the script don't help it, but rather hurt it. It is worth a passing glance if only to make you appreciate his other Bond films.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I feel sorry for this confused adolescent called britney spears. Poor woman who thinks that she has talent.  The only talent that she has is its body and how to showing it.  She  seems a squirrel singing, or  moaning. Facing the reality of Britney as a huge star is totally ridiculous . She is too beautiful, but she is not an artist, she does not deserve to have  a single recording. Persons like britney show that if you want to be a singer the only thing that you need is a big breast.
B00005JG6Q|1.0|I didn't like this movie. The end didn't make any sense with the whole infinite power that can't be controlled. The beginnig is really slow and doesn't go with the rest of the movie. The only good action is when Tetsuo gets his powers and fights the army and briefly the three kids.  I didn't get into the storyline and wouldn't recommend this movie if looking for 'Ninja Scroll' type fight scenes.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|If she is a singer I want to be a singer too. I know that I don't have any talent, but she does not have it neither. I completely sure that everyone sing better than her after listening this piece of garbage. I feel really offended with this cd, how her company allows britney to did this cd? The US lawS should  prohibit this cd, it is so awful that it can be considered environmental contamination.
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart not only stars Mel Gibson, but he directs this movie as well.  His leading lady in this movie is Sophie Marceau who is splendid as the future Queen of Englang.  After a long run at the theators Braveheart was released on V.H.S on May 21, 2002.  Braveheart was released by Paramount Studio, and is closed-captioned for the hearing impared. <BR>  Braveheart is a movie about a common man who leads his fellow man to freedom and a chance of a better life. Wallas saw his Father killed before his verry eyes, and was raised by an uncle who tought him to read,write and fight better by hand and with a sword then any man around. Wallas did not truly become blood thuristy untill his wife was killed for not giving herself to one of the nobels.  Then the battels truly became brutal and bloody with many deaths on both sides. The Crown of England may have might on it's side, but Wallas and his country men have justice on theirs. Braveheart will have you cheering,crying,laughing out loud ,and mad as hell. truly if you have not seen Braveheart you must.
0345457684|5.0|Wow. Richard K. Morgan's \\"Altered Carbon\\" is probably the best fiction book I've read all year. It is incredibly imaginative, grittily gripping, solid and seamless. Morgan's prose is on par with that of any modern \\"literary\\" author and will satisfy serious readers.<br />The book is cyberpunk, and so includes familiar existential mind-benders and a post-nation-state setting. But this is just the necessary backdrop, and not the focus of the book. Instead, the story is an Agatha Christie whodunit except with excellent character development.<br />I loved this book because it is an intelligent page-turning thriller. But I also loved the clever devices Morgan employs. For example, the protagonist (his digitized mind) is broadcast to Earth and sleeved in the body of someone else who's mind is in prison. And although we never meet the person who's body the protagonist is wearing, he becomes a central character. It also raises great questions about how closely linked our physical beings are to who we really are. In another part of the book someone makes a copy of his digitized mind and so is able to have a conversation with himself. What would you ask yourself? Is it yourself?<br />And if this doesn't convince you, the book is also packed with plenty of drugs, explosions, fights, [.....] and pimps, and surprisingly well-written erotic moments. Treat yourself to this noir sci-fi mystery; you won't regret it.
B00005JMFO|4.0|Charming and funny Love Actually deals with parallel plots lines involving a wide variety of characters. It turns out that most of the characters are connected through someone or something (a wedding, a school play). Liam Neeson takes center stage with the touching story of a step-father who just widowed. He's unsure about his relationship with his 10 year old step son because the center of his universe has been taken from him. Neeson plays a wide variety of emotions in the role written with the most depth.<br />Colin Firth stars as a writer who ends up going to a friend's wedding alone. It seems his wife is under the weather. He returns home early to discover his younger brother at his house although he's surprised, he's even more surprised when it's clear his wife is having an affair with his brother. After splitting up with his wife he finds romance in the most unlikely of places; he's staying at his vacation residence and finds it with his housekeeper. The only catch is that they don't speak each other's langauge but still manage to discover each other.<br />In the funniest bit Bill Nighy stars as washed up rocker Billy Mack. Mack is on the come back trail with a awful remake of The Troggs' song Love is All Around reimagined as a Christmas ditty. Mack hates the song and knows its a piece of garbage but he also recognizes this is a last chance for him and his manager. Nighy captures the larger than life Mack to a t. His love story isn't about finding the perfect mate but, instead, about his friendship with his manager/producer and how he discovers that friendship, loyalty and truth outclass the fame game.<br />Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson play a married couple whose relationship is comfortable. Unfortunately, Harry's (Rickman) new secretary at the magazine he works at has the hots for him. She makes it very clear and Harry's very tempted. This is one of the more emotionally rich bits in the film as well.<br />Finally there's the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) who can't find love. Or rather, he finds it at the wrong time with the wrong person. He's fallen head over heels with one of his staff Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Clearly the relationship would be complicated. He's unsure what to do about it despite the fact that he's fallen hopelessly in love with her.<br />The most unusual subplot involves a pair of stand-in's for actors. The twist is that they are stand in's for actors in what appears to be a soft porn movie. Their banter is innocent and despite the awkwardness of the situation, they both are attracted to each other.<br />Writer/Director Richard Curtis does a fine job of integrating the complex, interweaving story lines. He contrasts the relationships nicely and in such a way that they different relationships and the steps they are at comment on the other, more advanced ones. All the performers are marvelous and, while it won't win any Oscars, Love Actually is a fun bit of fluff that allows all the actors involved to give strong at times whimsical performances.<br />Be forewarned, though that the nudity (and language)during the story with the actor's stand ins may be a bit much for older folks and totally inappropriate for young teens. It's rated R for a reason--it's a romantic comedy but with a decidely adult edge. More than likley you wouldn't want to take your Mother to this although a wife, lover or close friend would make great company.<br />Love Actually is entertaining and funny.

Or rather, he finds it at the wrong time with the wrong person. He's fallen head over heels with one of his staff Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Clearly the relationship would be complicated. He's unsure what to do about it despite the fact that he's fallen hopelessly in love with her.<br />The most unusual subplot involves a pair of stand-in's for actors. The twist is that they are stand in's for actors in what appears to be a soft porn movie. Their banter is innocent and despite the awkwardness of the situation, they both are attracted to each other.<br />Writer/Director Richard Curtis does a fine job of integrating the complex, interweaving story lines. He contrasts the relationships nicely and in such a way that they different relationships and the steps they are at comment on the other, more advanced ones. All the performers are marvelous and, while it won't win any Oscars, Love Actually is a fun bit of fluff that allows all the actors involved to give strong at times whimsical performances.<br />Be forewarned, though that the nudity (and language)during the story with the actor's stand ins may be a bit much for older folks and totally inappropriate for young teens. It's rated R for a reason--it's a romantic comedy but with a decidely adult edge. More than likley you wouldn't want to take your Mother to this although a wife, lover or close friend would make great company. <br />Love Actually is entertaining and funny. It's also a tonic to all the Gen-X generated action adventure films and high concept garbage that studios usually churn out during the Holiday season.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|For a movie to work, even a special effects extravaganza, there has to be some minimal plot that hangs together.  This series is called after the &quot;Matrix&quot;.  But considering what's going on in the &quot;real world&quot;, what's so important about that?  I mean, it's just suppose to be a film story to keep the human &quot;batteries&quot; occupied (never mind if that makes any sense), but why is it necessary for the free humans to enter there and fight battles with other simulations?  It's all happening inside some computer, so who cares?  Why not fight in the real world, sabotage the equipment?  <br />Oh yes, one reason is to wake up humans, who presumably are then flushed and picked up by the free humans, like Neo.  OK, but once the machines figured that out, why don't they stop flushing?  Why not kill the awakened humans so they don't join the army?  They could hardly get free of the machines in their little cells, all tubed up and such.<br />And then we have the ending of the first film, where Neo turns into superman, with the intent of waking up humanity, presumably by demonstrating that the Matrix is a fiction.  Probably the best place to do that would be on the Leno show, but at least you would think that rocketing down mainstreet so fast that glass gets pulled out of buildings would alert the populace that something weird was going on.  But aside from one passer-by who drops her groceries, and a couple of cops, no one seems to notice at all.  Where's the press?  It's like in the first film after the big helicopter explosion - listen for emergency vehicle sirens.  Nothing.  If you're going to setup a world, it at least has to abide by its own rules.<br />I can suspend belief for only so long, and the bottom line is that I grew so disgusted with this nonsense that I quit half way through.  Guess I'll never find out what happens, but I don't care anymore, for the characters, the world, or for these supposedly wizard filmakers, who need to go back to school.
B0000028RR|5.0|this is really the only rage album you need to own. here they combine zack de la rocha's bleak militant raps with tom morello's brilliant guitar work. it all comes together with brad wilk and timmy c. supplying the tight back-beats. this was all replicated on their next four albums with somewhat lesser results. this is definately one of the heaviest, harshest, most aggresive albums of the 90's. <BR>check out the songs &quot;bombtrack&quot;, &quot;killing in the name&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, and &quot;township rebellion&quot;, some of the albums highlights.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|13th step is the best cd on the market today, aside from mer de noms of course. I am once again pleasently surprized by the metaphorically colored lyrics Maynerd has put to these awesome emotional tunes. I listen to alot of harder stuff, like Rage and mushroom head. Then also some STP and other stuff. My girlfriend let me borrow her Mer De Noms CD and I was blown away. I instatly fell in love with a perfect circle. Then I bout a thirteenth step and I was rendered speechless. Maynerd is my God! I can relate all too well to his lyrics and images portrayed in this music. Buy this CD and I promise you that you won't be dissapointed! ((((((((((aperfect circle)))))))))))

0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier weaves a terrific fictional story based on the real painting by the real painter, Johannes Vermeer. All 35 of Vermeer's paintings are transcendent and evocative, but the work upon which this book is based is by far his masterpiece. Chevalier's story follows the young maid, Griet, who works for the Vermeer family and is drawn into the reclusive painter's studio. The story is subtle and sweet and heartbreaking and honest. Chevalier's writing is a brilliant example of how a writer can balance a heady story with a rich setting, never sacrificing her story to overindulge herself in her gift for description - and she truly has a gift. The book is like literary chocolate, easy to devour and fondly remembered. If you haven't read it, I heartily recommend it; it's the perfect by-the-fireside book for winter.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The extra footage and commentary by Peter and the writers helped me understand the changes they made from the book.  So it's definitely worth it.  Still the best movie (other than Fellowship).<br />However I've tried two different platinum sets from Amazon and neither play Disc 3 and 4 on my Sanyo DVD player.  So I borrowed my brother's version of the appendices which worked fine on his DVD player.  But they won't play on mine!  What kind of DVD player do you need??  New Line Cinema - start explaining!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is a very nice soundtrack to bring The Lord of the Rings Trilogy to a close. &quot;Minas Tirith&quot; is a great track. The orchastration is amazing. &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; is very nice and has a Celtic like feel to it. &quot;Into the West&quot; by Annie Lennox is also a very nice track with very haunting words. Overall this CD is just great. I am not at all diappointed and I highly recommend it.

And I agree with you, among others, that we should read this book \\"not to hate\\".<br />However, you went on to make a critical assertion on the current state of Japanese education, which is mostly inaccurate.<br />>>....Did you know that the standard Japanese textbooks (until recently and perhaps still is the case) still did not recognize the Japanese invasion of Asia in WW2?<br />The fact is:<BR>\\"....Today all Japanese school textbooks mention the Massacre.  Of seven junior high school textbooks that have been used since spring 1997, every one mentions the Massacre.  In six out of the seven textbooks, the estimate of Chinese who were killed is at least 200,000; four of them also introduce the Chinese official figure of 300,000.  Only the textbook by Teikokushoin, whose share is 2% of the total market, does not mention any numbers, although it says that \\"the Japanese killed very many Chinese including women and children....\\" (excerpt from \\"A Japanese Historiography of the Nanjing Massacre\\" by Takeshi Yoshida, Columbia University) Also see the full article here: [...]<br />This is only about the Massacre. Of course, the Japanese invasion of Asian countries, which you assert is not recognized in the classrooms in Japan, is always described in detail by all history textbooks there, and has been taught to tens of millions of kids, ever since the democracy was reinstalled in the country after WWII. Hence the deep undercurrent of anti-war sentiment held by grass-roots Japanese, along with the ultra-pacifist constitution maintained to date despite all the debates.<br />Regarding the Massacre, I remember my textbooks in the 1980s dedicated many pages to describe the Massacre.<br />I fully agree with you that what's more unfortunate than the Massacre itself is distortion of the history. By the same token, distorting the post-war state of Japanese education, and an ignorance of their struggles for truths during the past 50 years including Ienaga textbook court cases, would lead only to hatred. And hatred never creates positive impact on mankind. <br />My apologies for being blunt at times, if I sound so. But I felt compelled to point this out because your misconception seems to be commonly held by many, perhaps influenced by sensation journalism which reports on a relatively small group of right-wingers as if they represent the entire nation, but not on the silent majority's views.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|I'm a big Pink fan and think she's the best singer around today. I eagerly bought this CD expecting it to sustain me through maximum repeat listenings, but unfortunately, it doesn't hold up to Mizunderstood, in terms of depth of songwriting. Pink's voice is awesome, of course, and she sings the s**t out of most of this material. But only a singer of her caliber can rescue the pedestrian lyrics of &quot;If God was a DJ.&quot; I do like her hit &quot;Trouble,&quot; and was especially moved by her acoustic performance of this song on the American Music Awards in which she proved, once again, that she's cream of the crop of current girl singers.<br />I do really dig &quot;Waiting for Love.&quot; You can't help but think of Robert Plant and Jimmy Page on this one. It's pure classic rock. &quot;Unwind&quot; is her tribute to Janis Joplin. The lyrics are somewhat obvious, but Pink lets it rip none the less.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|No pop snob, I. Britney Spears' previous hits tell the story. (And the story is: Britney knows how to make damn good danceable hits.) With her latest CD, the Big &quot;B&quot; steps into the zone with some ripping tracks. Current fave: &quot;Early mornin'!&quot; Hello??!!! This song GETS DOWN, y'all. &quot;Toxic&quot; is an excellent track that is really cool and danceable. But first and foremost, Britney has struck again up with another worthy smash hit, featuring the memorable line: &quot;Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control, come over here I got something to show you...&quot; sung by none other than Madonna. The tune is already a pop classic, in my humble opinion.<br />Look, Britney Spears hasn't sold 50 million albums because she sucks. Get over it, ye who insist on throwing rotten tomatoes at the  girl. Sour grapes, people.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|It's Sarah, so automatically, I feel like I have to own it. I had slight reservations buying this and with Sarah being one of my favorite artists, I was afraid she'd go the route so many of my other faves have gone: that she'd switch to something that's just not her, and is new and a thinly veiled attempt at staying 'fresh' without staying true to the artist. I was pleasantly surpried to hear that this is quite similiar to her previous releases.<br />So I breathed a sigh of relief.<br />Then I got to the end of the CD and asked myself &quot;well, where was the outstanding songs like before?&quot; There just weren't any. They were good, but not great. And Sarah's voice was often overshadowed by... stuff. Effects and synthy music that was so unnecessary. She's an outstanding singer, we don't need extra effects. <br />Where was the depth? The pain? The passion? Why wasn't I saying &quot;yes, I've felt like this&quot; when I was listening to these songs as compared to her others? <br />I haven't gotten an answer. Honestly, the CD is fine. It's good, the songs are of fairly good quality, and they're better than any of the pop-fluff you'll find with Britney, Christina, or Jessica at any rate. It's just not as good as the standard Sarah set for herself with her other records. And... only ten songs?! What?!?! I wanted more. We all wanted more. We waited this long, where's the payoff?<br />A solid buy, but not the outstanding release I was expecting.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X-men 2 was the best movie to grace the silver screen this year, and its one of the best sequels ever made.  This movie is so good that it even surpasses its predicecer (X-men) and it introduces increadable new characters. The special effects and action in this movie are breathtaking, and all the action will keep you on the edge of your seat.  This 2-disk dvd is packed with special features, and nearly a dozen deleted/extended scenes. There are 2 seperate commentaries for the movie and a number of behind the scenes documentaries. Strap yourself for an awsome story with explosive action. Highly recomended.

B00008AY3L|5.0|All I can say about Ben Harper is that his music is Incendairy, His lyrics and music put together make a combination that is unequaled in music. It is funny how people judge, making assumptions on how music &quot;should sound&quot; but in reality music is meant for one thing, to touch your soul, and Mr. Harper does what he does better than many musicians, eg. Punk Rock... two chords, to make a song? how is that possible?

0684857219|4.0|Let me first say that no one should follow the programs recommended in this book unless they're on drugs.  You will get overtrained.<br />Now that that's out of the way, I totally recommend this book.  Here's why:<br />1.  It's absolutely FULL of awesome and inspirational photos!  I'm not even kidding.<br />2.  Good history of physical culture and how it evolved into bodybuilding.<br />3.  This is the main reason: this book has the largest collection of exercises in it, and, unlike so many other books, has MANY PHOTOS and DETAILED INSTRUCTION for each one.  In this regard, even tho the diet and exercise regimen sections are basically worthless, that this book shines, and is well worth the price.<br />Another popular exercise book, &quot;The Art of Expressing the Human Body,&quot; by Bruce Lee, has a bunch of exercises but has NO PICTURES for them.  It only has a little description.  Terrible!<br />As I said before, this book is definately worth the price (for the softcover edition, anyway), because of it's exhaustive list of exercises and their accompanying detailed photos and descriptions.<br />But yeah, ignore the diet and training parts.

B000058983|4.0|Let me start by saying that this is a good--a very good--album, and one that was certainly underappreciated for the better part of 20 years.  But it's -not- as good as its cultists suggest, and here's why.<br />1)  Focus.  I realize that one of the joys of FC is its scrambled, wandering quality, but too many cuts here lack musical coherence.  Dynamics shift without apparent purpose, and several songs squander their tension before accomplishing anything.  It's the kind of mistake a second-string psychedelic band like Cream made a lot, and that a first-string band like the Beatles seldom did.<br />2)  Vocals.  No truly great rock album can be made without pretty darn good singing, and the albums to which FC is most often compared--Sgt. Pepper, Pet Sounds, Odessey and Oracle, Volunteers, Five Leaves Left--all highlight exceptional vocalists.  Arthur and Bryan are capable enough within the bounds of a certain style, but it's very mannered, and it wears:  it's the kind of portenteous folkie-troubadour intonation that you get with the early Tim Buckley (or the early Justin Hayward) and loads of lesser schleps like Scott McKenzie.  The singing on FC generally lacks variety, subtlety, power, and insight; when it works, it does so by not intruding too much on the music.<br />3.)  Lyrics.  FC's lyrics, heard out of context, might well be taken for a -satire- of high psychedelia rather than its best expression.  While fans of the album make much of its songs' lyrical swings from sunny to morbid and back, Arthur's reach-for-the-rhymes technique frequently feels both contrived and incoherent, rather than cosmic.  Sometimes there's not a whole lot separating the lyrical content of FC from that of, say, an average Strawberry Alarm Clock record.<br />4.)  The \\"Grab Factor.\\"  Even the sprawliest and most difficult psychedelic masterpieces (see above for some suggestions) have a solid handful of songs that stick in the mind from the get-go and demand to be listened to again and againRIGHT NOW.  With the exception of \\"Alone Again Or\\" there's not a single cut on FC that's a standalone, world-class attention-getter.  The album relies on texture and cumulative effect for its impact, which is all well and good, but it hardly cries out to be called the stuff of genius.<br />Again, I should point out that I do like this record quite a bit.  But I think some of the rabid excitement that surrounds it has more to do with its long period of relative obscurity and the fact that Arthur Lee (like Alex Chilton and Roy Wood) is the kind of f'ed-up, eccentric, manque talent that rock geeks never tire of \\"rediscovering\\" and \\"vindicating.\\"  Buy FC?  Absolutely.  But don't count on it to change your life.

B000003TA4|1.0|Why is this even considered an essential album? I don't understand at all.<BR>First off, let me dispell the myth that Nirvana was the first band of its kind. Mudhoney was doing the exact same thing 3 years before Nirvana formed. Sure Nirvana turned mainstream music around, but their sound was by no means original.<BR>Now, we hit the dirt. Nirvana was just a terrible, noisy band. That's it. Their riffs were horrible, their guitar solos frightening, Kurt's voice like nails on the chalkboard. There were so many bands during that era, most of them far ahead of Nirvana when it came to talent and songwriting, but they never got the credit they deserved.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Don't let the stupid title and the stupid cover put you off on what is probably the best music story of the year, the recovery of a great Beatles album from a botched production job.<br />The Beatles were a ridiculously ambitious band from the beginning of their career to the end.  The sessions for &quot;Let it Be&quot; started in early 1969, just weeks after the release of the White Album.  John, Paul and George were each expected to have new songs ready for this misbegotten film/concert project.  By comparison, bands today can take 3 years between albums and be considered productive.  So it's not surprising that the material would be a little weaker--except, now that we really hear it properly, it's not weak, it's good!  In fact, I think John and Paul's songs on this album beat most of their stuff on the more-respected &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  This is accomplished in part by the addition of John's b-side &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; to the song list. In addition, Lennon gives us the great &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; the better-than-you-remember it &quot;Dig a Pony,&quot; and his essential bridge section to McCartney's better-than-you-remember-it &quot;I've Got a Feeling.&quot;  Paul's stuff is even better--really the last great Paul songs before his solo career.  I'll take &quot;Get Back&quot; or &quot;Let it Be&quot; over anything Paul contributed to &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; even the &quot;suite&quot; of unfinished fragments that everyone thinks is so brilliant.<br />Shorn of the glutinous orchestrations and pseudo-documentary transitions (you won't miss &quot;phase one, in which Doris gets her oats!&quot;), almost everything here is better than you remember it, because the remastering makes even the agreed-upon classics, &quot;Get Back,&quot; &quot;Let it Be,&quot; &quot;Two of Us&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; sound more like what Paul originally intended, the band (plus Billy Preston on keyboards) playing in your living room.  Another highlight is George's &quot;For You Blue,&quot; which on this album is a revelation.  Not that this is such a stellar song, but it is one of the Beatles' best-sounding performances.  It's loose, yet precise.  I can't stop playing it.<br />So your imagination reels... could it have been possible for the Beatles to go on this way?  It was sort of the direction the Stones took, going forward by picking up the driving rock sound of their past and updating it. This album rocks more convincingly than anything on the White Album or Abbey Road, or any other album they did after &quot;Help!&quot;  This was the true genius of the Beatles--how they played together, which is why I tend to prefer their earlier stuff.  When they got too careful, well, of course sometimes it worked great, but sometimes they were a little stiff.  Nothing on this album is the least bit stiff. It's pure pleasure, and most worthwhile.ght is George's &quot;For You Blue,&quot; which on this album is a revelation.

B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes certainly don't have a claim to the best anything in music. They are far from being the best band and &quot;Is This It&quot; is far from being the best album out there. <br />Many of their songs do sound very similar(besides &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Last Nite&quot; most of the songs are nearly indistinguishable). Most of their songs do lack emotion(at times I would swear that the lead singer is a robot). And the production is certainly grungy to say the least. <br />The plain truth is that &quot;Is This It&quot; is an experiement in style over substance. Not that style is a bad thing, but even the Velvet had a few memorable lines. Many people have and will continue to bash The Strokes for the things I've mentioned above(among other things), but I think through all the hype emerges an entirely passable album that is above-average compared to most pop music out there. At the end of the day The Strokes and &quot;Is This It&quot; won't do anything to change the face of rock music, but many of their songs are so energetic that I just can't help but to smile and nod my head when I hear them, and it's because of that alone I recommend this album.
B00009TB5G|5.0|There's a reason (beyond Tolkien's neurotic fanbase) that this film has been so well received.  And it's largely because of one man's vision about the making of the LOTR trilogy.  His name is Peter Jackson, and he deserves our notice (as this film shows us).<br />But let's get into the film shall we . . .<br />The Two Towers is the continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is based on the second book in J.R.R. Tolkien's magnum opus, The Lord of the Rings, which, in itself, is a continuation of the children's novel, The Hobbit.  But don't be misled.  The Lord of the Rings is NOT a children's story.  This is a fantasy story for mature teens and adults.  It's dark, violent and very complex.<br />This story picks up exactly where it's predecessor---The Fellowship of the Ring---left us.  Frodo and Sam find themselves running in circles.  That is, until Gollum (aka Smeagol) forcibly joins their company just so he can be close to The One Ring that Frodo is carrying toward Mount Doom inside Mordor, where he must cast it into the fire in order to destroy the spirit of Sauron (which dwells within The Ring).  The acting of the Gollum character is excellently portrayed and pulled off by a combination computer generated image and real person.<br />Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pursuing a band of Orcs who've kidnapped Merry and Pippin.  When they believe that Merry and Pippin were accidentally killed by a band of horsemen from Rohan, they despair.  But not for long.  Gandalf is reincarnated as a White Wizard, sent back to turn the tides of Middle Earth.  He tells Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas that Merry and Pippin are safe with The Ents (a group of talking trees as old as mountains...sort of).<br />These are the two main storylines from which the camera switches back and forth.<br />It is worth noting here, too, that almost all of this filming took place in New Zealand.  And they did an excellent job scouting out their locations.  The mountain-top Hall at Edoras was absolutely spectacular, as were the shots of Helm's Deep.<br />For those interested in &quot;extra footage&quot;, this platinum series edition DVD is sure to be of great joy to them.  Let me show you why:<br />1.  Sam and Frodo have more screen time as they move toward<br />Mordor, so the sense of time passing is more evident (this is sure to please LOTR purists).<br />2.  Boromir returns!  Scenes depicting his angst against his father and those between his brother (Faramir) and the father are also excellently done and add weight for what is to come later.<br />3.  More time with Merry and Pippin and The Ents.  Merry and Pippin get to drink from the Ent Wash and grow a bit, as well as having them find Sauruman's stash of food toward the end of the film.  And the Ents talk so much that you get a better sense of how slow their thought processes are.<br />There is, of course, more but I don't want to spell all of it out for you.

Jimmy Page mezmerizes with his ability to solo, especially on the beautiful &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;. He truly is the godfather of rock guitar, because he pushes the limits of the instrument on every single song. John Bonham thunders through every song, showing why he is considered one of the greatest drummers of all time. His best work is on &quot;Kashmir&quot;, simply for the thickness of the beat he stomps out. He also shows he can sing a little back-up, something I never knew before. Robert Plant wails at his best on all of these songs. I have never been a fan of singers who sing as high as he does, but his voice becomes another instrument in the intricate songs of Zep. I was also most impressed with the work of John Paul Jones, the forgotten bass player of the band. He is solid throughout, despite his lack of a flashy style. He also plays the keyboards on a few songs, the best being &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot;. There is also a nice break on disc 2 where the band plays three acoustic songs, including one of my favorites, &quot;Going to California&quot;. <br />I could ramble on for pages about how good this DVD is, but I won't. Just go out and buy it, because it is the best showcase for one of the greatest bands of all time. <br />Best tracks: &quot;Going to California&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; Okay, so basically they are all amazing.
B000053VAF|5.0|Great movie, even beter if you are familiar with the bible and not afraid to challange your faith.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|While eschewing the moody and brooding overtones of Mer De Noms, A Perfect Circle, with Thirteenth Step, has crafted a wonderful and emotional album. While those fans looking for a repeat of classic songs like Judith, or The Hollow may intially feel a twinge of disappointment each successive listen to TS brings new insight into the power and intensity of this band. Maynard James Keenan has never sounded better in this listeners opinion, including his incredible work with Tool. On the cuts Blue, and especially The Nurse Who Loved Me, MJK's voice drips with emotion. Looking closely at the entire album, I cannot find one song that does not move me in one way or another. What other endorsement could you possibly want? Highly recommended.
0380973464|4.0|The most interesting thing about Cryptonomicon is the way the author has written a book which takes place simultaneously in the past and present.  Characters from the 1940's sections of the book (or their offspring) are characters in the 1990's section of the book.  Things you learn in the &quot;past&quot; affect your understanding of the &quot;present&quot; and vice versa.  I have never read a book which does this so effectively.<br />Although the book got off to a slow start (in my opinion), it soon becomes more interesting as the different sections begin to weave themselves together.  It is over 900 pages, so plan to spend quite a long time reading this.<br />If you have a mild interest in WWII, cryptography, computers, the internet, or the phillipines, then this may be the book for you.<br />The central question of this book: will Amy and Randy get together?  Actually that's not it - but it's fun to think about as you read.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I think too many people have the wrong idea about the series. The directers of the Matrix trilogy are big anime buffs. They set out to make the worlds best live action anime movie. Well, I think they did just that. You just have to keep in mind that anime movies take awhile to unfold. They usually come in pieces. They start off with the story to let people know whats up. Then they let loose the action, usually the main character going full force in some struggle for a specifice goal, Reloaded is just that. It consists of a whole lot of action in a way no one has ever seen it in real life. You also have to remember that its not a stand alone. Your lost without the last half and you don't get anything without the first one. In most anime series near the end the emotions are let loose because of the hard struggle they just finished off, this gives the characters a human emotional feel. Last the story comes to a conclusion. I'm sure the last movie does just that. Many people don't see the beauty of japanese anime, but the Matrix directers did and I think they did a wonderful job of bringing it to life.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The Matrix Trilogy. In a way you could say it wanted to be the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy of the 21st century, yet it won't be. Why? Well, personally I found all three films entertaining, as long as you could suspend your disbelief and only watched them once. Perhaps the first film raised people's expectations too much, and it was a dystopian view of a world ruled by machines (like Terminator), though with the spin of high technology and virtual reality. Yet forget any deep analysis it is, more-or-less, action throughout. The second film picks up where the first began, continues the action and special effects and fills time for the third film to come around, which wraps it all up, with a positive, though slightly ambiguous ending for humanity. In a way, I feel the thing that hurt the trilogy wasn't so much the films (no worse than Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi when compared to Star Wars, really), it's just their moment in the public imagination ended after the first film. Notably, perhaps, it is a reworking of an Oxford Professors work whose dramatization will be remembered fifty years after being conceived. Now surely the idea of that, in these times of Hi Tech, would be Fantasy/ Science Fiction.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity (James Mangold, 2003)<br />See this movie. See it now. Spend the film wondering how director James Mangold (who did manage to make one very good film previous to this in Cop Land, but has otherwise foisted such tripe upon the viewing public as Girl, Interrupted and Heavy) and screenwriter Michael Cooney (he wrote a script for Jack Frost 2: Return of the mutant Killer Snowman. Need I say more?) managed to put together such a startling, refreshing piece of filmmaking as this.<br />Ten strangers are stranded in the Nevada desert during a rainstorm. They start dying. As the deaths get more and more incongruous, the survivors begin to turn on one another. It's a very thin plot... or it would be without a twist that is, quite simply, completely different than anything you've ever seen in a thriller. It's a plot twist that ranks right up there with Fight Club, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, `Salem's Lot (the book, not the movie), fill in whatever you want that left your jaw hanging open. The setup is brilliant, the payoff even more so.<br />Much of the credit here is due to a stellar cast, headed by John Cusack (Max, Being John Malkovich), who has turned his eighties teen stardom into one of the best-managed careers in Hollywood today. His foil is played by Ray Liotta (Narc, Cop Land). Others at the hotel are John C. McGinley (Scrubs, Intensity), Amanda Peet (Igby Goes Down), John Hawkes (From Dusk Til Dawn, Playing God), Jake Busey (The Frighteners)... you get the idea. High-powered cast. Everyone has perfect timing throughout. Expect much; you'll get it.<br />Easily one of the best films of the year, if not the best. A must for any fan of intelligent thrillers, horror films, graveyard humor, John Cusack... oh, forget it. It's a must for everybody. **** ½
0385504209|4.0|The narrative style is very much the same as in Angels &amp; Demons (which you should probably read first) - with ample use of symbolism and wonder to keep the reader hooked. The ending - predictable in kind, but not in substance makes it sufficiently distinguished to make the book a worthwhile read. There is also enough substance on the history of the Christian religion to lure the reader into further discovery of this fascinating subject.
B000059PPN|3.0|House by the Cemetery (Lucio Fulci, 1981)<br />One wonders, idly, why it is that Fulci felt the need to make (essentially) the same movie twice in one year. While House by the Cemetery is set in Boston, the family configuration is different, and the long-leggetie beastie is a different sort of thing, House by the Cemetery might as well have been outtakes from the superior The Beyond. Just to add to the similarity, Fulci cast Catriona MacColl as the female lead in both.<br />Just in case you've never seen The Beyond, the story: family (in this case, family has kid) moves into eerie house. Strange things start happening, most of which involve a lot of blood. Family members uncover long-buried secret that is the key to understanding the nastiness, but by that time, it's pretty much too late for the knowledge to actually help anyone, and we end up with a long, bloody climax.<br />I can't quite put my finger on why, of the two films, The Beyond seems like the superior product. The acting quality is about equal, the set decoration is similar, the plot makes all the appropriate twists and turns (and some of them are unpredictable), the cinematography is appropriately dark and brooding where it needs to be without going over the line into David Fincher-like claustrophobia. I guess it's because House by the Cemetery doesn't have the gratuitous spider scene The Beyond has (and let's not forget Maria Marsala's memorable turn in The Beyond, either, a parallel of which House by the Cemetery lacks).<br />It's good bloody Fulci fun, and a fine way to kill (with a large axe, of course) an hour and a half. But The Beyond edges it on the rewatchability factor. ***
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok when this cd first came out, i was hesitant to buy it because i always thought britneys music was kinda too poppy for me but i ended up buying it cuz madonna came out on her first single, whiich is one of my favorite songs. after hearring the whole album, i can't say that i dis-like any of the songs. its definatly an improvement from baby one more time and oops i did it again.this cd has a more mature sound. it is a great cd and recomend it to everyone even if you think britney is talent-less cuz this cd will definatly change your mind.
B000053VAZ|4.0|Benny and Joon (Jeremiah Chechik, 1993)<br />Benny and Joon is, quite simply, an anomaly. Chechik's directorial efforts, both before (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Nuff said.) and after (The Avengers. The American remake of Diabolique. Nuff said.) have been worth of nothing but the cutting-room floor. Aidan Quinn (Songcatcher, Plainsong, many other movies with \\"song\\" in the title) was in the midst of a decade-long career slump, and Mary Stuart Masterson (Fried Green Tomatoes) was at the very end of her Hollywood viability. So why is it, exactly, Benny and Joon works?<br />Work it does, and very well. The main reason is a couple of extremely risky casting decisions. Johnny Depp was still a cult figure (and he plays a role that fits in very well with his early nineties persona), and Julianne Moore was still \\"that woman who used to be on a soap opera.\\" Minor roles were filled with rising stars like Oliver Platt (Lake Placid), CCH Pounder (ER), and William H. Macy (Pleasantville), all of whom were still in the character-actor stage at the time. In fact, aside from Masterson, the only really recognizable face in the film is Dan Hedaya, one of Benny's poker buddies. The casting folks took risks, and those risks panned out.<br />Benny (Quinn) and Joon (Masterson), a brother and sister, have been living on their own since the deaths of their parents twelve years previous. Benny owns an auto body shop; Joon is a professional nutcase. Benny is involved in a weekly poker game with, to say the least, the most interesting stakes of any filmed card game in history. One week, while Benny and Eric (Platt) are outside talking, Joon sits in for him. One of the things she wins in the pot: Sam (Depp). What is wrong with Sam is never fully explained, though severe dyslexia plays a part in it (it wouldn't be out of line to suggest that perhaps Sam is mildly autistic). Sam is obsessed with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and pretty much every move he makes in the film is modeled on one or the other of them. To say any more in a review would spoil the plot.<br />The script is perfect (odd that scriptwriter Barry Berman has only managed to produce two other scripts deemed filmable by Hollywood, both were disasters), the acting fantastic. How, I don't know. But Depp turns in a solid performance, as does most everyone else (Julianne Moore didn't really have enough of a part to work with). Masterson shines.<br />Definitely worth watching. *** ½ed on one or the other of them.

B0000AXE8I|1.0|Destroys many of the great ideas set forth in the first installment. Definitely a &quot;Don't watch&quot;, both from a philosophical and from an Entertainment point of view.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I thought I had reviewed this set years ago, I'm wrong. This cd set was released remastered and in the form it is now, back in 1996 for Canada. I have the original Canadian release, the jewel case is not a single sized &quot;hinged&quot; style, but the larger double case size.  The mastering for both import and domestic is the same, superb. Disc one is the entire &quot;Christmas Portrait&quot; released in 1978, and disc two is the posthumus release &quot;An Old-Fashioned Christmas&quot; released  in 1984.  All of the performances here are definitive and draws compairison to Nat King Cole's 1961 rendition of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; in terms of perfection. Album two is amazing due to the fact Richard had few vocal outtakes left from 1978 and built an album around those remaining sides. One song, &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town,&quot; is a single from 1974. To fill out the album, Richard recorded a long overture and a number of beautiful instrumentals. Richard relocated to England to work on the &quot;Old-Fashioned Christmas&quot; album with the late Moody Blues and &quot;Old Fashioned Christmas&quot; arranger Peter Knight and recorded his part at Apple studios, home of his beloved Beatles.  Karen's vocals, long accociated with melencholy and sadness, make these carols bright and the non-secular songs even more sacred and intimate. &quot;Merry Christmas Darling&quot; serves up a reminder of who we're listening to.
0345452577|5.0|I'm not even finished with this book, but feel compelled to write a 9 star review!!!  While I love Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, this one has gripped me, kind of like Billy Straight.<br />I still have about 80 pages to read and am still not sure where this one is going. However, since I started it this morning, I know that this is going to be one of my FAVORITE Kellerman books.<br />Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist whose love, Jocelyn, has been murdered.  The police suspect him.  Dr. Chess, who works at his hospital, takes an interest in him.  An unusual invitation by Chess to a gastronimic feast with some very important people leaves Jeremy confused, especially since Chess has left suddenly for Europe, sending him postcards that read &quot;traveling and learning.&quot;<br />Jeremy is also getting inter-office mail not addressed to him specifically, and is very confused by the content.  He tries to piece together the information.  Possibly his new love, Angela, holds the key.  Honestly, I don't know...but since I have work to do tonight, I will not be able to find out until tomorrow!<br />I can't wait....honestly, I can't wait.<br />  Kellerman, this is one of your best!!!  I have never read so far into a book without knowing what the premise is and what the outcome will be.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
0790729687|2.0|I liked this movie rather well when I was younger, but after watching it again recently, I found it almost intolerable.  I don't know why I ever thought Tom Cruise as a pompous, nihilistic vampire was worth watching, because he's not.  He's just TOO Tom Cruise to stand, and all the makeup and poncy clothing in the world can't change his mannerisms and facial expressions.<br />This movie takes itself much too seriously, and all the manufactured angst and darkness reminds one of the public access Floridian goths on SNL.<br />Honestly, Brad Pitt's acting was pretty okay, but any redemption to be found in his performance (as far as the film goes, overall) is eclipsed by the wretchedness of the rest of the production.<br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, save teenagers who perhaps are still impressed by this kind of thing.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|As with everyone else, I do not think Britney sings well, but she seems to be famous because she is a great performer. She has the looks, the body, dances really well, controversial, and an okay singer-this makes the perfect package for a successful star. I use to make fun of her old songs from her last album. I thought it was so stupid that she had to prove that she wasn't this little girl anymore, but not yet a women-huh?<br />Anyway, In the Zone is a pretty good album. It makes you want to move to the music especially when driving during those traffic hours! Toxic and Boom Boom are the best ones in the album-and this is coming from someone who is not a fan of Britney Spears!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Great CD. The Songs are more hard hitting than Silver Side Up, and I think its a good change for Nickelback. From &quot;Flat on the Floor&quot;, probably the hardest song on the CD, to &quot;Learn the Hard Way&quot;, The Long Road delivers. Great sophomore set Nickelback, keep up the good work!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I used to hate Britney Spears and couldn't stand her music, but over Thanksgiving weekend, my sister came home from college and made me listen to the new CD.  I fell in love instantly.  Britney's music is no longer poppy; it's great to dance and have a fun time to.  I would definitely say this is her best album yet.
B000000H6D|4.0|This c.d takes you into the dark,beautiful world of death. T.O.N has done this like no other band I have heard. The songs on this c.d is like a story. With each song telling a different part. This album explores the worlds of : religion,love,pain,and death. Bloody Kisses(a death in the family) Is the most beautiful song ever wrote. The pipe organs, and guitars are perfectly blended with the bass & vocals. The lyrics are a haunting masterpeice.  Christian woman is a wonderfully peacefull song without making you go to sleep. Black No 1.,and Summer Breeze are Darkly romantic songs good for any date. The surprising element is : Unlike their angry songs about cheatin/revenge; The songs Too Late Frozen,and Blood & Fire tells about nursing a broken heart. You feel you're not alone. The guitars are awesome. We hate everyone is a cute,yet true song about society's prejudices.<br />As all albums aren't 100% perfect,there are a few down sides:<br />The vocals can get WAY too deep sometimes, which evokes the feelings of sandpaper grating the eardrums. The non-digipack verson has 14 songs. Half of them are horrible intro/clip type peices like \\"fay Wray come out and play\\" & \\" 3.0.I.F.\\" Which dosent relate to the album in any way. These peices are exremely irritating to the nerves, ranging from screaming & whining to grunts and strange traffic/radio noises. This is why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5. <br />The Digipack version includes \\" Suspended in Dusk\\",and thankfully all the annoying intro's/clips gone. Unfortunately, it lacks Blood & Fire, and We hate everyone; which are crucial tracks telling Bloody Kisses's story. <br />Despite the downsides, this is an amazing cd,which I highly recommend you buy.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A moving, spiritual event honoring the memory of George Harrison, featuring friends and musicians who worked with George throughout his career.

0743455967|4.0|&quot;On Writing&quot; is only the second Stephen King book I've read. The first, &quot;Danse Macabre,&quot; was also non-fiction. I'm no literary snob, but there are a lot of books out there to read and only so many hours in the day, and I've chosen not to read fiction about people who blow things up with their eyeballs or possess other powers not likely to be encountered in real life. I'm sure King's phenomenally popular output has more going for it than that, but it has limited appeal for me. Still, I'm always curious to know what other ink-stained wretches have to say about the craft, so I had to read &quot;On Writing.&quot;<br />You'd have to be very curious indeed about King's methods to wade through his &quot;memoir of the craft.&quot; Early on, he describes &quot;On Writing&quot; as a way to record all he knows about writing &quot;briefly and simply.&quot; He does keep it simple, avoiding the pretentious language one often encounters from &quot;writers&quot; who want to impress readers with their vocabulary. Brief is another matter. He quotes William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White's &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; claiming he'll follow their advice to &quot;Omit needless words,&quot; but he makes that promise in the &quot;Second Foreword&quot; where he also suggests this is a &quot;short book.&quot;<br />A short book? With a &quot;Second Foreword&quot;? Those looking for guidelines to more effective writing are better off with Strunk and White whose short volume has never been improved on. With King, one is dragged along as he recounts his beginnings, relationship with his mother, and, later, the accident that nearly took his life. It's certainly interesting, but try finding the advice for writers in there. He does offer valuable suggestions, but if all you're seeking is tips to improve your own writing, you can find better guides than this one. If you're interested in King's life story, however, dig in. On that level, it's a good read.

6304983778|5.0|This is a brilliant film, yes its slightly cheesy in some places and perhaps the effects aren't that great, but guess what? its got a great story, its got lovable characters and its got magic. We see how Santa comes into being, how he deals with each year and the changes it brings, and in the modern world, how he deals with competition, by being what he has always been, the very spirit of Christmas, warm, loving and kind.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I don't get it...What more do people want.  This is probably, and this is not just an opinion, the greatest group of musicians ever in the same band in music history and it is still not good enough for some people.  As far as Portnoy writing lyrics, Moore is gone, get over it; some one has to write lyrics.  If you look at all the old albums, including the ones with Moore, Portnoy wrote a good amount of lyrics then too, no one complained about his lyrics then.  And everyone who thinks that \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" was their masterpiece; who wrote the bulk of the lyrics...Portnoy!<BR>This is a great album, peroid.  It is different than \\"6 degrees\\", which is different than \\"Scenes From a Memory\\", which is different than \\"Falling into Infinity\\" and so on.  In my opinion, that is what makes a great band, they still show their style without it getting stale or changing with what's popular at the time.  It is a heaver album so maybe the keyboard sections are tamed down as to previous albums, but they are there and played amazingly.  I do have to agree with some reviewers about the playing of JP.  Don't get me wrong, he is truly amazing, but sometimes playing fast is just playing fast.  Granted, it is welcomed in this day and age of people who only play 3 chords, but what happened to solos like \\"Another day\\" and \\"Surrounded\\".<BR>I think \\"Another day\\" is JP's best solo yet, it has emotion and taste that he seems to be missing now.  I still love every solo he plays, I just expect more emotion from someone so talented.<BR>Personally, I really don't want to hear another \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", a great album should be left alone and not try to be copied.  As with all DT albums, I am already waiting in anticipation for the follow up to \\"Train of Thought\\".  Even if people don't think this is as good as their previous work, giving this band less than 4 stars is an insult.  This is a 4-5 star band just on the musicianship alone.<BR>I feel that if people listen to this album enough, they may want to change their reviews...It grows on you.  If you don't believe me, listen to \\"In the Name of God\\", if that song isn't running through your head for days......
B00005JMFO|5.0|I absolutely adored this movie and wish I could have a dvd of it right now! Definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. I have never seen so many sweet moments in one film. And it was actually intelligent and not every ending is a happy one. It will definitely make you want to call up everyone you love and let them know it! Which is always a good idea :)
B00005JL96|5.0|After a long break in good movies, the Walt Disney Company has been able to miraculously create a movie comparable to its classics.  It seemed like for quite some time the Walt Disney Company had run out of ideas, so it resorted to making sequels for many of its classic movies.  Then, without warning, the Walt Disney Company came up with a brilliant idea for a movie.  The movie was \\"Lilo and Stitch,\\" and it seems to have become an instant classic. <br />When I first heard of the movie, I thought that it was going to be another pathetic attempt to turn an original idea into a movie, but much to my surprise it was quite the opposite.  The commercials leading up to the release of \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" portrayed the movie as a movie directed toward young boys, with aliens and guns, but it turned out to be a movie that everyone could enjoy.<br />Up until \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" came out, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was my favorite Walt Disney movie.  Instantly, \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" became my favorite Walt Disney movie, in addition to \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" of course.  The story line behind \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" is like many I have heard before, but with a unique twist. <br />Lilo, one of the movie's two main characters, was an oddball.  Not liked by her peers, her sister decided to adopt a pet for Lilo to befriend, but gets more than she had hoped for.  Not only is this movie adorable, but it also has a good message behind it.  The moral of the movie is to not care what other people think, but to always believe in yourself and know that the people who truly matter will always be there for you, a moral that every child should have bestowed upon them.<br />Another positive message one receives after watching this movie is one concerning self-image.  In this movie, all of the characters are drawn to proportion, and do not look unhealthy due to how skinny they are.  The characters look like real people, not fat, but also not sculpted and perfected.  When a child sees this movie, he or she will see that not everyone can have a perfect body or look sleek and slender, but that it is okay to be healthy.<br />Lilo is able to hula her way into the heart of many people who watch Lilo and Stitch, and as a result has become a favorite Disney character of mine.  Like many other Walt Disney Company movies, Lilo and Stitch also has a sequel, but this sequel is not cheesy like most sequels are.  Rather, this sequel is nearly as good as Lilo and Stitch was.  If you enjoy \\"Lilo and Stitch,\\" I would highly recommend seeing \\"Stitch! The Movie.\\"  Also, if you enjoy the idea behind \\"Lilo and Stitch,\\" I would recommend \\"Lilo and Stitch: The Series.\\"  Each of these installments is a continuation of the idea behind \\"Lilo and Stitch.\\"<br />The Walt Disney Company really made a wise choice in creating this movie.  I know that I loved all aspects and installments involving \\"Lilo and Stitch,\\" and I hope that you will to.  Aloha!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I seen this in a half empty theatre and bought the rather skimpy  DVD.I loved it and I consider it one of the best films.I see alot of<BR>people have their interpetations of this unique film.WOW! Some 800    responses.I tried to 'solve' this myself.I now think Mr. Lynch didn't want to spell the story out.IT'S a fools game.People just look silly and trite trying to explain a dream.Look at a piece of art and there a million different responses.Everybody is both right and wrong in their answer.I believe there being no Lynch commentary track speaks volumes.A Mystery is only a mystery when we don't know what the mona lisa smile signifies.A stunning and hypnotic film gazing experience.This film has many wonderful and brillant small scenes.My only gripe is  this film should of had<BR>story chapters.I loved REQUIEM OF A DREAM also.Try to watch this <BR>film in the spirit of KUBRICK'S 2001.If you must read people's opinions remember a dream is silly cuz it's illogical.Kudos to  DAVID LYNCH for not spelling it out.This film was not greeted  by<BR>the american film industry kindly.It's easy to see why.I love so many scenes in this film.The photography,the music score, the faces of actors,the humorious diologue..etc.It reminds me the first time I seen a Fellini film.IT'S A FILM TO TAKE IN YOUR SENSES.GET IT AND ENJOY!

As Sting says at a Paris press conference in the film, this is a film about the beginnings of a rock band; where other music films record \\"Swansongs\\", the end of a band's era, Sting wanted to document a band's formation, growth and the trials and tribulations of a group of musical strangers, working to put it all together. And that's exactly what we get. Included are all the great songs from his first solo album, 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles'. Each musician in the band, through the course of the film, is interviewed about their thoughts on the music and their feelings about working with Sting. We also get a look into Sting's working habits as a songwriter and musician, and we discover that he's a perfectionist and quite the taskmaster.<br />Most of the film is shot in a beautiful 18th century mansion, once owned by Napoleon the III. This gives the film an almost otherworldly ambience. The band rehearses for hours on end, from the early hours until late into the night, preparing for their debut concert in Paris. As they work towards this debut, we come to realize that there's a lot on the line in terms of Sting's career. The record execs are nervous but quietly optimistic as this is Sting's first solo endeavour. The pressure is on to produce and perform a few hits after the mammoth success of The Police - the rest is history. To add a little more drama, Sting's wife, Trudy, is also about to have their first child. All the band members have a bet on the exact date of the infant's arrival, and as it turns out, Sting wins the bet. The timing of the child's birth (which we see) couldn't have been any better.<br />This film provides great insight into Sting the man and the artist. Despite this film being almost twenty years old, it retains its allure and has withstood the test of time. It should be standard issue for any Sting fan.is film provides great insight into Sting the man and the artist.

B00004Y7SF|5.0|Aguilera really shines on her Seasonal Christmas Album. I play it every christmas around the house when I'm decorating the tree and getting in the Christmas Spirit<br />At times Aguilera goes a bit overboard on her vocals and overdues some songs but in the longrun everything sounds absolutely wonderful to the ears<br />Fantastic Album! Christmas wouldn't be the same without a copy!
B00006EXL5|5.0|My Chemical Romance are originals in there growing genre and perfected their style in their debut albumn. The music is full of energy and emotion only to be complipmented perfectly by lyrics that display pure talent in poetic forms. They haven't simply duplicated a working equation but they have learned to write song after song that differs from the last but is beutiful in its own sense. Amazing

B00004S6GL|4.0|Dont let the four stars fool you. This album is better than 99.9 percent of all other music in todays industry. But this is clearly not Elliot's best work. I prefer both XO and Either/Or to this album, but it is still an incredible piece of work. While the songwriting and playing is among the best Smith has shown us, it seems as though alot of the feeling that is so prominent in his earlier music is lost to over-prodcution here. Ironuically one of my favorite tracks (Junk Bond Trader) is the most produced song on the album, but overall the album doesnt hit quite as hard as elliots previous works.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The DVD is well worth the buying as the two movie discs are fantastic.  Unfortunately I can't make any comment about the two appendices as I'm unable to play them.  I'm having the same problem with the looping as other reviewers have mentioned.  I have just returned my 8th copy of the deluxe version.  As I have gotten the version from 4 different sources [my first came from Amazon] and have had the same problem with all of them I believe that rather than it being a bad batch there is a glich in the coding on the discs that make them uncompatible for some DVD players.  No store where I've gotten the discs have reported that they are being returned because of this problem.  I have a Sony DVD player and wonder if anyone else out there with a Sony player is running into the same problem.

It has brought the delight of Italian Cuisine into my home with real recipes used in homes of real Italian families. Even for a beginer cook, you can not go wrong, I know because I was a beginer. I shocked and delighted my family and friends with the meals in this book. It is a must have for every one who loves Italian food!!!
B00000GJ2B|5.0|Yes, this is the best movie of the 1980's. Yes, DeNiro gives one of the finest performances ever, by anyone. And yes, this film was criminally overlooked by the Academy. It really is that good. Everything about it is amazing.
1400049628|5.0|I was looking through the Humor seciton of my local bookstore &amp; the title caught my eye. I skimmed through it looking as though it was a valuable read, and indeed it was! As I read through it, I read quotes from the book to my dad, laughing to some the of the outragous things the book mentions about the zombies &amp; reminds me that is impossible to happen, but hey, you never know; there is some pretty good proof. Anyways, this book has been added to my top 10 booklist, &amp; I will definitly be reading it over &amp; over. To those who think this book is all fake, I will be laughing you as you get eaten by flesh hungry zombies!
B00000DGUM|3.0|This is definitely an excellent compilation of Skid Row's best hits, but I don't understand how they (apparently Rachel Bolan) could have left off &quot;Wasted Time&quot;.  Perhaps it is just personal preference or my own taste, but that is my favorite Skid Row song.  It's a hard-rocking song that tugs at you like a ballad.  It was a big mistake leaving this off of the album!
0385504209|1.0|First, this book is poor fiction and one man's perspective based on questionable and/or purely subjective sources.  As a thriller it works if one does not mind a story based on pure speculation.  Albeit, it is well-written, but it is hi-lighted with pure speculative history.  The book may have been 'well'researched' but many of the sources used are not respected or as highly revered and/or respectd as the author and unifomred 'experts' would have us believe.  There are several major of flaws with the basis of the big secret. First, the spiritual/historical Jesus was the embodiment of God (who does not need to feed any of the hungers that mortals do- no marriage, children, et al).  Therefore, this whole flimsy concept of a marriage is a non sequitor. If you are going to use a real historical figure, DO NOT change his character.  Second, DaVinci was a self-proclaimed enemy and critic of Christianity.  So is it any wonder that his painting renditions of Christ would contain insulting messages of contempt for the Christian faith and tradition.  Third, there were no female apostles.  Anyone knowing Judaic and social history of the times would know that woman did hold any positions of real power in the Jewish or early Catholic faith.  Finally, Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute, rather an adultress.  The only thing that Dan Brown has done is to give 'wings' to hearsay and gossip based on highly unauthoriative and questionable writings that cannot be taken without serious thought to their original intent.  While he is at it, why not dig up the writings of old European navigators who thought the world flat and write a book about a secret - that the world is really flat.  This book is pure garbage and an insult to anyone with any knowledge of history and Christianity.  I am only thankful that I did not buy this book - I borrowed it and saved myself some money.  If you want to read some good historical/speculative/thrillers, read the LaHaye and Jenkins books.  They are well-researched and well written.researched and well written.
B000005JA8|4.0|Not many people appreciate Captain Beefheart. In fact, many people truly loathe the man, and especially this album. Me, I don't see what the big deal is. Sure, it's really, incredibly, extraordinarily difficult the first three times, but after that, you could find yourself loving it. I know I do - Beefheart's lyrics are unique, at times incredibly child-like and innocent (&quot;Frownland&quot;), and also extremely frightening and insane (&quot;The Blimp&quot;). I have to say that the album should have been released as a double CD...this would surely make it much more palatable. Musically, the band is very influenced by free jazz, as seen by the unbelievable polyrhythmic patterns used by the drummer, Drumbo (not the Mascara Snake - he sings backup, plays bass clarinet, and plays percussion). Beefheart's cavernous voice is extraordinarily compelling, and Antennae Jimmy Semens (who sings &quot;Pena&quot; and &quot;The Blimp&quot;) has the most screwed up voice I have ever heard in my life. The guitars and bass playing on this record is out of control, and yes, it was all thought out beforehand - intelligence and virtuosity masquerading as shambling, drunken anarchy. Priceless.
156898443X|5.0|Danny Gregory's lovely and often startling book reminded me of how important it is to really partake of the world--in all its painful beauty. Through his unique vision, expressed through wry humor and wonderful drawings, he captures the grandeur in small things and the commonplace in matters that could seem unfathomable. With crystalline honesty and unsparing wit he describes how he was transformed by the subway accident that left his wife (who sounds amazing) disabled, and by learning to draw the pictures that helped him negotiate their new life together.
B00005JM02|1.0|The movie had great visuals and is intresting enough for 3-5 year olds, but the plot (a little kid getting lost) has been done several times by pixar. In monsters inc, for example, a little girl finds her way into the monster world and the monsters help her out. In ice age, a little kid gets lost and some prehistoric creatures help it get home. Now pixar hits us with... a little fish getting kidnapped and his aquarium mates trying to get him home, only this time, the parent is looking for him. That is the only real difference I have seen between these three pixar movies, and the message this one seems to delever with the most force is that it is cute and funny to be a moron(Dory has a three second memory span, or something, and never shuts up at all through the movie). It was quite posabily the most horrible movie I have ever had the great displeasure to not be able to avoid seeing, this and the other two movies I mentioned(Ice age and Monsters inc). But I guess the cheesy plot sells, and we can expect more little kid getting lost movies.
B0000TB050|5.0|I loved the Elevation DVD and today I got the Slane castle one and was blown away by it. It had much more soul and looked less grandiose than the Elevation DVD, although this one had 60,000 people more present than the Elevation DVD. Every track stands out and Bono's vocals. Everything stands out in this DVD. Not much more I can say since the other reviews have said a lot. Go get it!!! You must!
B0000024SI|5.0|For me, it will always be Bob Dylan, not William Burroughs or Allen Ginsberg, who is the defining icon of the counter-cultural movement. It is Highway 61 Revisited, that dumping ground for traditional American images, that sums up the surreal confusion of the 60s far better than Strawberry Fields Forever. Like its predecessor Bringing it all Back Home, many of the songs derive from the absurd, existentialist worldview he learned from the French Surrealist. In the liner notes to the previous album Dylan wrote &quot;i accept chaos. i'm just not sure it accepts me,&quot; then later &quot;all the great books have been written.&quot; The songs on this album are evidence of the chaotic urgency and action with which the world must now be imagined. The folklorist criticism that Dylan's introspective songs were explicitly apolitical has always seemed a little strange to me, given that when this album is placed in the historical context inwhich it was written, much of the 'inpenetrable' lyrics are more easily understood. Like a Rolling Stone and Ballad of a Thin Man are devestating critiques of society (the impulse to destroy, however can be creative.) The Vietnam War, never explicitly mentioned, hangs over every song on the album espescially the title track: Dylan is singing about a world where a father will sacrifice his son in the name of an idea; where the roving gambler, looking to start a next world war is told they can &quot;put some bleachers out in the sun&quot; (Vietnam, of course, was the first televised war) &quot;and have it on Highway 61.&quot; &quot;Desolation Row&quot; is a powerful statement on images of popular culture, conjuring up a world where nothing is real, everyone is someone else (&quot;I had to rearrrange their faces / and give them all another name&quot;) and none of the figures, be it &quot;Einstien disguised as Robin Hood,&quot; Cinderella who &quot;seems so easy,&quot; or &quot;The good samaritan...getting ready for the show&quot; enact the rolewe expect of them. Song lyrics are not poetry, mainly because they are designed to be sung to music. After all, who can imagine Tombstone Blues without heaing that unrefined garage rock sound? However that doesn't mean they can't make powerful artisitc statements. This has to be a defining album in Rock and Roll: it allows music to be complex and elaborate, but also angry, confident, unrefined and LOUD. The one problem I have with Highway 61 is Dylan remains the supreme author figure gazing down gleefully on the carnival he has created, and there is no sense, as there is in Visions of Johanna or his confessional songwriting of the 1970s, that he is himself implicated in this confused world.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The best soundtrack of the three by far, and though I love Enya, Annie Lennox's song demolishes &quot;May It Be&quot; from &quot;Fellowship.&quot;  Absolutely stunning all the way through, &quot;Into the West&quot; will send shivers up your spine and bring tears to your eyes.  Worth every penny!
B00003W8NO|5.0|I THINK THIS MAY BE THE BEST ANIMATED FILM EVER ! EVERY ONE SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THIS IN THEIR COLLECTION OF MOVIES. TOY STORY WILL ALWAYS BE SPECIAL IN OUR FAMILY. DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE ONE OR TWO BEST MOVIES FROM WHEN YOU WERE A KID? . WELL THIS IS AN ALL TIME FAVORITE FOR YOUNG AND OLD. A NEAT TREASURE TO PASS DOWN. GROUNDBREAKING WORK.<BR>WOODY IS THE BEST !
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears has always been a trendsetter.  She is this generation's version of Madonna.  Fittingly, the two icons team up to sing together on the albums first single, &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;.  The track shows Britney's vocal powers, rather than her range, which unfortunately she tries to emphasize on a lot of the album.  (An exception is in the tracks of &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;.) Britney's true vocal talent is hidden behind her gaspy, high-pitched singing through a lot of the album.  It is almost reflective of Mariah Carey's latest album attempts, where her earlier albums were chock full of powerhouse vocals and fullness.  Hopefully Britney starts to recapture her strength rather than holding on to trying to reach the top octaves.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Beautiful and thought provoking.  A must see film for all the family.<br />This film will surprise you with the strength of the emotions that it creates.<br />DVD extras are also well produced.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|ALL HTE PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT THIS ALBUM WAS BAD DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKIGN ABOUT .. DONT LISTEN TO THEM ... READING THESE REVIEWS ALMOST STOPPED ME FROM GETTING THIS CD .. BUT I THOUGHT, WHAT THE HECK, I GOT IT PLAYED IT AND COULDN'T STOP PLAYING IT. .. AWESOEM CD! WOO HOO LOL
B00005JMFR|5.0|Okay, alot of you people have taken this movie out of the context that it should be watched and \\"reviewed as you so call it\\" in.  Reloaded and Revolutions are \\"one\\" movie.  They are meant to be watched in succession.  For this reason I think you people have forgotten what the movies are about. The Wachowski Brothers created this world and to understand it you must think inside of their rules.  Now, grant it, they broke most of their own rules in the making of the second and third movies, but just hear me out.  the entire philosophy of these movies is based on the idea that all humans are slaves and are connected to the Matrix so they can be used for a source of energy.  This INCLUDES Neo.  Agent Smith is the program form of Neo's opposite. Neo can use his powers in and out of the Matrix because he reallized the choice that he made. For that reason he can use his powers and for that reason only.  I can't beleive that I'm fixing to say this but, you people are thinking too much.  I know that the Wachowski's have made you do this but just \\"free your mind\\" and try to invision yourself in Neo's shoes.  You can \\" dodge bullets\\", and fly and all can be done because you choose too.  Not because its allowed or because you were born to do it.  Because you choose too.  Everything comes down to choice.  Without choice, everyone would die.  This and many other points of these movies are looked at out of context.  If you just free your mind, its not all that hard to imagine.  It was mentioned in the first movie but I guess nobody else heard it. Ver badem: \\" If you get caught using that.  I know.... you DON'T EXIST!.\\" These are all being applyed to our rules and our beliefs.  Look at it as Neo looks at it.  In code!!<BR>Peace.......Out.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is definitely a feel good CD! I am an avid music listener and have been my entire life. I have an extensive music collection of over 600 CD's and I can honestly say that I can count on one hand the number of CD's that are truly enjoyable from beginning to end, and now &quot;Chariot&quot; is one of them. I haven't been this excited about a new artist in a while. Musicians of his caliber give me hope for the future of music. From track 1 to track 11 this is a sensational collection of songs. There is so much soul in his voice it gives me chills every time! Although I was not lucky enough to catch him performing in clubs in the early days, I count myself as one of the lucky ones who have found him and his music now! I look forward to hearing more from him and watching him develop into a BIG star.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Okay.  Lets get the obvious out of the way.  Reloaded and Revolutions are the same movie, just broken up into parts.  So don't judge Revolutions on what it lacks because all that you are saying it is missing was in Reloaded.  Did you want the Wachowski's to repeat themselves over and over again.  This movie was awsome if it is looked at in the context that it is meant to be watched.  The story was awesome! The action was upped another 10 notches and it through me for a loop when Agent Smith said that The Oracle was his mother!!!! I mean where did that come from!!!!!! It just pops up out of nowhere.  That and the fact that the war is finally over are good closures to an excellent story and a wonderful Trilogy!! This is a must see for ALL MATRIX FANS and all action movie fans in general.  Sure, if you haven't seen the first two movies then the third will open and leave you hanging but if you look at them in their rightful context, then its easy to see that they are great movies.  And if you think about it, none of us have really seen any of them, because with the reviews that I have read, you are all living in a dream world if you think these movies are anything short of spectacullar!!!!!!.....................................................................................................................................................................................................SYSTEM..FAILURE.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
B000096FUD|3.0|Painful to watch, like anticipating an accident, this film kept me interested.  I watched it with a producer who kept flinching, wincing and groaning as the story moved agonizingly forward.  Why was so much attention placed on such a public display of failure?  <br />I believe reality TV is popular because people are fearful of failure.  The truth is people come up short every day in millions of ways, and it's better to have failed at something than not to have tried anything.  <br />And this is not the first failed attempt to bring Don Quixote to the screen.  Orson Wells couldn't do it and Terry Gilliam fell short.  Bravo to anyone who has the courage to break the Curse of Don Quixote.<br />Michael Duranko<BR>[...]
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This album is OK. Not great, not bad. As long as the original LET IT BE stays in print. This is basically another look at the songs from the 1970 album using several different takes without Phil Spector's overdubs. I like &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; being added to the lineup, but disappointed &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie May&quot; were removed. I also don't appreciate the sudden ending to &quot;Get Back&quot;.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|When the original Let it be came out in 1970 many of the songs were changed from what the beatles inteded them to be because of a man named Phil Spector. Across the Universe had a choir added and the Long and Winding Road had an entire orchestra.  The Beatles wanted a raw sound that didn't have overdubs and studio effects.  This is what Let it Be Naked is.  Although there is not much of a difference between this album and the original, this one sounds much better.  Across the Universe is only an acoustic guitar and sounds beautiful.  Let it Be no longer sounds like a black gospel song.  Now you may be wondering if  there is enough difference between the original and this to be brought.  My recommendation: If your just a casual fan and already have the original you should probably avoid this CD. For a die hard Beatles fan like myself, this album is a must.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD on the strength of hearing the track &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; twice on the radio driving from Cleveland to Columbus.  I have purchased albums many times on the strength of hearing just one track and have usually regretted my impulse.  Not so on this occasion, Come Away With Me was one of my better impulses and I am just pleased I gave in to it.  This CD has no weak songs and just relaxes stress away as though by magic.  I think it is the only CD my wife and I fight over to take in our car, maybe we should just go crazy and buy a second copy.<br />I could go on and on about phrasing, timing and the maturity of Norah Jones voice, how she reminds me a little of Billie Holliday on some tracks and so on, but it will take too long.<br />My favorite track is The Nearness of You which I think I am right in saying is an old Hoagey Carmichael number, second favorite is Cold Cold Heart, but as I said there are no weak songs.<br />Fill the bath tub, get a glass of wine, light the candles and Relaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaax!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|In my mind the matrix is the worst film that i know and have seen. For starters it was too long with too much information and the storline i dont understand. I wish i hadnt spent my hard earned cash renting the damm thing. The special effects were too special and so made the film seem fake and toke away any thought that it might have been any good. Worst of all though was the actors who were abysmal in their roles. You might as well have Keano Reeves (aka NEO) as an animated character, hes so awful in this role. Agent Smith is also as bad, but lucky for him he has actually done some decent acting before. Matrix is terrible. Matrix is the most boring, complicated, terrible and awful film ever. Plain and simple - The Matrix 1,2 + 3 are the 3 worst films on the planet, full stop!!!!!!
0440237688|5.0|This book is very wonderfully written and enchanting. When I first started to read it I couldn't put it down. The author has a great imagination and can really relate to someone or somthing that can be hard to. I recommend this book to everyone (including adults) Its soooo good I reread it over and over again! This would be a great Christmas or b-day gift for any age.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Perhaps by chance, perhaps by fate, this movie came to me during a time of transitions and reached in and changed the way I perceive the world.<br /><br />I am now closer to understanding my obligations to human society than I have ever been--for the first time I understand what the Lakota mean by their simple prayer, &quot;all my relations&quot;.<br /><br />May this emotionally and psychologically powerful film reach you as well.
B00005JLTR|5.0|This was a great remake the one in 1937 was very good too, I can not wait 'till it comes out on dvd. I loved Kris & Barb I have seen all three movies and like this one best. Good god I hope they don't make one with J-lo it will be as bad as the Judy Garland one! They would only give me five stars I would give it 10 stars! A must see for folks who like Kris I also like Alice doesn't live here anymore.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|After 18 years of marriage, I sought an appropriate book that might help me become more pleasing to my husband. I could find no detailed explanations in christian literature, although I knew that the Bible explicity tells the \\"older women to teach the younger women HOW to love their husbands\\"...so I sought a book that might not violate my conscious. I bought this book because I thought the author might be sympathetic to women who are turned off and feel violated by explicit pornographic photos. This book had no photos but it does take unexpected turns that does violate the consciouses of women who have christian character.<br />There are subjects that I just prefer not to know about when I search on enriching our love life!...<br />The only redeeming factor was the complete description of the male anatomy and a few sporatic suggestions about technique.<br />I just felt that all the accolades this book has received, someone needs to warn those who are wanting to perserve the sanctity of the marriage bed, this book is not for them.
B000089RVR|1.0|Siempre lo mismo DIDO<br />No hay nadie como Christina Aguilera
B00008NG5V|5.0|something interesting about this album ( something jack has said ) is that they borrowed a lot of ideas from a tribe called quests &quot;low end theory&quot;. when you listen to this album, i definitely does not soud like a hip hop lp, but you can see the influence. <br />    i really love this guys music, so my review is going to subjective, but jack is a great musician. every one of his songs is the real deal, an uncompromised work of art. jack is technically not the greatest guitar player ever, is no the best singer, does not make extrememely &quot;clever&quot; arrangements, but his whole album, i repeat, his whole album, bleeds with soul.  this is the special kind of music that is made without pretense, without hidden motives, and seemingly without much effort. jack says that if his music career phases out, that he will just keep making music for his friends, like he originally intended.<br />i was at a concert of his back in l.a. last year, and i kid yelled out from the front row, &quot;be my friend jack! &quot; man, he just smiled while still playing his guitar, stopped singing, and said,&quot; you dont have to ask, i already am.&quot;
B000002UZ6|3.0|Tina Turner is brilliant, that is a given.  But this 'greatest hits' or 'Best Of' misses the mark in some respects.  For starters, it only includes one big hit from the 70's (Nutbush City Limits) and that is remixed! What about &quot;Acid Queen&quot; or &quot; Proud Mary&quot;? <br />Thankfully, they have included the original of the 1966 hit &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;.  Tina did several re-recordings of this classic - yet none of them match the magic of Phil Spector's work on the 1966 version.<br />This collection is similar to other compilations, in that it also includes brand new tracks (at the time of release).  I hate it when record companies do this.  This is valuable space that could have been used for the classics that have been omitted.<br />For casual fans only.  True fans will want the &quot;Private Dancer&quot; album.
B00008OE4W|5.0|I currently own the original Widescreen Edition (1998 Universal). I'll buy the 2003 Collector's Edition, but I'm very disappointed by the paucity of extras: This movie is too good to have this few DVD extras.<br />One of my favorite movies of all time, for all of the same reasons listed by others here. I own the original DVD, which was released in 16:9 anamorphic, quite ahead of its time. <br />Unfortunately, it's painful to see a favorite movie come out on DVD with so few Special Features. This was a wasted opportunity, considering the quintessential ensemble cast that made this movie as fun as it is. The movie's 11 years old, and while I'm glad Universal thought enough to re-release it earlier this year with director Phil Alden Robinson doing a commentary track, I think there's much more that could have been done. I can understand the difficulty in tracking down such an incredible ensemble cast after 11 years. But as a consumer, I can say: this movie is too good to have this few DVD extras.<br />I *will* buy this new version for the following reasons: It's under $15, my existing copy is worn from repeated use, and I have been hoping for extras such as Robinson's commentary. I am, however, disappointed at the waste of potential on Universal's part: The quality of this movie deserves a DVD with a lot more to it.<br />5 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the extra features.
B000002O8D|3.0|This album is not even close to the classic live album &quot;One More From The Road&quot; (the 2 cd deluxe edition is outstanding).  So, if you do not own that album, get it now and pass on this.  If you're a die-hard Skynyrd fan (your not a fan if you can't even spell  Lynyrd Skynyrd) this album is a pretty decent listen.  The band plays fairly well and Rossington's guitar is in fine form.  Heck, you might even play this 3 or 4 times.   After that, however, you'll just keep goin' back for Ronnie and the real thing.  Bring on those mules!!!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Those who lived through the 70's (and still remember it), have been positing, for a long time, the following claim:  Led Zeppelin were one of the greatest live bands in the history of rock 'n' roll. As their officially-released catalog bears it out, however, this has been perhaps a little hard to believe for many who weren't there -- even so for latter-day Zepheads. The Song Remains The Same, the band's first live album, has always had a spotty reputation, while BBC Sessions, though great, was not a true live album in the sense that it wasn't recorded in front of a live audience.<br />Finally, at long last, the wait is over and the claim has been proven. How The West Was Won ranks among the great live records of all-time, faithfully capturing all that was great and thrilling about a Zeppelin concert:  the jams, the grandeur, the band interplay, the solos, the indulgences. Culled from two California shows in mid-'72, the album captures the band between two of their greatest albums, Untitled and Houses of the Holy. The tracks collected here comprise a great overview of their first five albums, including most of the best-known ones, and a few others as well. <br />As listening to the discs makes clear, the band truly shined in a live setting. They were great at improvisation, as few bands before or since have been. This is in evidence all throughout the discs, from the very long numbers to the shorter ones. New life is breathed into every song:  numbers that have been driven into our consciousnesses for years through constant album-playing and on rock radio sound newly fresh and invigorating. For myself, a Zeppelin fan for years who began to grow somewhat tired of the band due to repeated playings, this was a revelation. Page and Plant always like to talk about &quot;light and shade&quot;:  the alternate soft and heavy sides of Zeppelin's music. Sans the acoustic section, this is mostly missing in the live setting, where the vast majority of the songs go straight for the gut. Stairway To Heaven is entirely electric, and Page seems to be hurrying impatiently to get through the soft, slow opening part of Over The Hills and Far Away. All of this is apropos, of course. Some of the shorter songs really come alive in a live setting:  Black Dog, which features a wonderful, ripping guitar solo and a great percussion outro from Bonham; Heartbreaker, which benefits exquisitely from an extended Page solo; and The Ocean, which rocks harder than it would on its forthcoming album debut. That said, the band also proves its eclecticism here, absolutely storming through two very long numbers:  Dazed and Confused, and the Whole Lotta Love medley. The former finds the band tearing apart one of their first great songs -- jamming to great avail, improvising, while also incorporating bits and pieces of other songs here and there. The latter mixes old blues and early rock 'n' roll songs with one of the signature Zep songs, with Plant doing very well on some of the covers while the rest of the band rocks out. These two tracks, long as they are, are perpetually interesting -- often great, occasionally indulgent, but never boring. Last but not least, an acoustic set is thrown in for good measure; it features a beautiful version of That's The Way.<br />Throughout the years, many people, including industry insiders such as Eddie Van Halen, have denounced Page's live playing as somehow sloppy or inconsistent. Here, he truly gets the last laugh -- proving all of them wrong, and improvising in a wondrous way that Van Halen himself could never hope to achieve. He truly cements himself here as one of the great rock guitarists of all-time. And John Bonham, of course, simply shines, even more so than he always did in the studio. These classic songs would be worth listening to anew, if only to hear how he absolutely drives every song to the limit with his thunderous elephant beats and titanic fills. Plant alternately screams and whispers, God-like, through the entire set, while the sometimes under-appreciated Jones drones on, sans spotlight.<br />My only complaint about this album is the overlong drum solo. It becomes exhausting somewhere between the 5- and 10-minute points -- and then goes on for another 10. As great of a drummer as Bonham was, he worked best in the band setting -- where he could land his killer fills -- and does not necessarily shine as a soloist. Still, it would be unjust not to include the track -- and, after all, there's always the &quot;Skip&quot; button.<br />All in all, simply an indispensable live document, for everyone from the diehard Zepp addict to the casual rock fan. It is truly a live album for the ages.
B000002MVT|4.0|With the release of the \\"Chrome, Smoke & BBQ\\" box, this album is pretty much rendered obsolete.  Almost all the tracks presented here are included in the box; and with better sound quality.  So for ZZ fans who want to pop this in their car cd player and go, it's a great compilation (with the exception, however,  of \\"Heaven, Hell Or Houston\\" ...arguably the worst song ZZ ever did...yet it is on almost every \\"greatest\\" album or box).  If you do not already own any ZZ Top cds, the \\"Chrome..\\" 4 cd box is definitely the way to go.  You can not go wrong with Billy Gibbons on guitar, period.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Simply put, I wish I hadn't wasted my money.  The song I like best is track 1.  I should have just gotten the CD single.  Now I'm off to sell it to the local re-sale record store.
B000000XB9|5.0|CCR is  one of the greatest American bands in the history of rock music.  CCR arguably was America's greatest \\"singles\\" band;  with the exception of Chuck Berry, very few American artists could put so much music into a song 3 minutes (or less) in length.   All the best CCR tunes are here in this 2 disc set.  This is an album that deserves to be in every music collection.  I would give it 10 star if I could!
0446677450|5.0|~This is one of the most enlightening books I have read in the three years I have spent at college, and it was one I was not assigned to read.  Robert Kiyosaki's book taught me some common myths about becoming rich.  People can work hard all their lives, with high levels of education, and never become rich.  The difference between the rich and the poor and middle class is that the rich buy assets while the poor and middle class buy liabilities.  If you read this book, which I recommend, you won't~~ ever forget that sentence.  He mentions it a few times.  He tells some of his successes, and the strategy behind becoming rich.  He does not necessarily tell you what you have to do to become rich directly, but he outlines the principles.<br />I also like his writing style, which had me laughing at several points throughout the novel.  I especially recommend this book to any young people who don't want to have to work their entire lives.  I like the book, I like his writing style, and I am about~~ to read the rest of his books.  I recommend him.~
B000002KKK|5.0|Arguably the best album the group ever made.  ZZ Top's defining muscial moment; and a must have for ANY music fan.  Billy Gibbons \\"guitar-slinger\\" attitude and playing have never been better.  Ya' got the real drum kit, the tube amps and no electronic-synthesizer mumbo jumbo to be found.  If you need to buy one ZZ Top album...this is the one.
0385504209|5.0|My husband bought this book for me out of no where, and mentioned that I might like it. I am not a big mystry book reader but WOW, this book was great. I could hardly put it down. From the first page to the last it captivated me. It makes you look at what you think you know in a completley new way. It was an easy read but the twists and turns really kept you interested. Characters were great too. I am going to go buy another Dan Brown book ASAP!
0679720200|5.0|I don't believe Albert Camus had any that idea that his novel `The Stranger' would be so popular and timeless when he wrote that book in 1946. It is not a fluke, but he didn't seem to have many aspirations and pretensions when writing this short, but amazing, book.<br />In a nutshell, `The Strange' is the story of an Algerian, Mr. Meursault, who loses the strings of his life, and leads a flow of events decide his fate. The narrative begins of the death of his mothers. He is forced to go to the retirement house where she used to live and attend the funeral. In doing so, he feels strange, and doesn't seem to have any tender feeling toward his dead mother-- to the surprise of the local people. Later on he starts dating Marie --but notice he doesn't love her. It is just that it is easier to be with her, than being alone. He ends getting involved with Raymond --who seems to be not very honest. And in an unfortunate event he kills an Arab. That's when his life falls apart. Well, it would, if he was a normal person but he is not.<br />Camus has created a vivid --albeit lacking in energy and chutzpah -- character to be the protagonist of his novel. Meursault is not a normal person, however he is just the French average Joe of the mid 40s. He doesn't have many aspirations for his life; he lets the flow of events drive his life. The book is so well written that after a couple of pages you really feel upset with him. Is he incapable of showing feelings, or doesn't he have any feelings? These are questions raised throughout the novel, but it seems that the writer never came up with a plain answer to that, because it is not easy.<br />Like it is stated in the novel `Everything is true and nothing is true.' Like in life, it is nothing is really one thing. It all depends on a referential to what is true and what is not. Meursault seems to not have this referential. He simply doesn't care about being alive and governing his life. With this Camus shows all that generation angst. They seem to lack strong feelings, or even any kind of feelings.<br />`The Stranger' is one of the 20th Century classics, one of those books destined to be discussed forever-- because it generates so many different interpretations. More than book, it became a cultural event. It is a novel that deserves multiple readings.ey seem to lack strong feelings, or even any kind of feelings. <br />`The Stranger' is one of the 20th Century classics, one of those books destined to be discussed forever-- because it generates so many different interpretations.

B00007LTIC|5.0|\\"Going For The One\\", originally issued in 1977, is overlooked in the Yes catalogue (the same goes for 1978's \\"Tormato\\" for that matter). It finds the band in between the truly prog-rock early years and just before the less-then-thrilling foray of Top 40 (\\"Owner of a Loney Heart\\"). I personally am very fond of this album. The album includes the hard rocking \\"Parallels\\" and the majestic \\"Awaken\\", not to mention \\"Wonderous Stories\\", still one of the band's most popular tracks after all these years.<br />This \\"Expanded and Remastered\\" edition (12 tracks, 79 min.) has of course the original album, but is supplemented by 7 bonus tracks. \\"Montreux's Theme\\" is an instrumental from the same sessions. \\"Vevey\\" is a live instrumental (recorded in a church!) of Jon on harp and Rick on church organ, just beautiful. \\"Amazing Grace\\" is a studio recording of Chris' amazing bass-solo, performed frequently in concert. The remaining tracks are (early) studio run-throughs of the album's tracks, providing a fascinating inside look on how the tracks sounded in their embryonic stages. \\"Going for the One\\" is here as an instrumental. \\"Parallels\\" is heard without the towering church organ. Best of all, \\"Eastern Number\\" is a 12 min. early version of what eventually would become \\"Awaken\\".<br />Kudos to the fine folks at Rhino for putting together this exquisite reissue, and showing others in the industry how it's done. Excellent liner notes, great pictures, fascinating bonus tracks, it's all here. Essential for any Yes fan.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This cd is one of the cd's that always seems to be in my cd player, I can't help it. Norah Jones has amazing talent, if only she could have shown it a little bit more! Most of the songs do not have that much range (therefore are easier to sing along to...) but she is so much more talented than that and the lyrics to almost every song are amazing. I would give it 5 stars if it was harder to sing along to...meaning she should have put more range in the notes she sang. Most of the cd has the smooth sade-type flow to it. It's nice to mellow out on...<BR>There are some great songs on this cd for example:<BR>#2-seven years- the lyrics are amazing!!!<BR>#8-lonestar - vocal range is pretty good, and the sound is different.<BR>#10-One flight down - lyrics are so poetic, and vocals are really good!<BR>#11-Nightingale - the sound of the song is so different from any other song, really excellent. <br />My suggestion is to definitly go and buy it, becuase it's worth it and if you had a hard day, its nice to relax to... :)
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|(Music: 4.5 Stars  Compilation: 1.5 Stars)<br />The outside packaging of &quot;Peter Gabriel Hit&quot; boasts the phrase &quot;The Definitive 2 CD Collection. How misleading! This collection of songs (29 tracks; 151 min.) is neither a &quot;greatest hits&quot; as several hit singles are missing, nor a &quot;best of&quot; as several key album tracks were overlooked. Instead, I think this is Peter's idea of what in his mind his &quot;definitive collection&quot; should sound like, rather than giving the fans a straight-forward collection of his biggest and best tunes. The collection is divided up between the &quot;Hit&quot; CD1 and the &quot;Miss&quot; CD2. Why the CDs are subtitled that way is not clear, as certainly not all tracks on CD1 are &quot;hits&quot;, and some tracks on CD2 in fact are.<br />Gripe 1: it's clear that Peter is quite fond of his 2002 album &quot;Up&quot;: 5 of its 10 tracks are on here! Nevermind that none of them in fact was a hit, and to add insult to injury the only song fron &quot;Up&quot; to be released as a single (&quot;The Barry Williams Show&quot;) is not even on here!. Ironically, I also like &quot;Up&quot; as an album a lot, but it simply does not deserve 5 songs on here.<br />Gripe 2: There is only one, yes you read right, ONE song (&quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;) from Peter's very successful debut album. &quot;Modern Love&quot; and &quot;Moribund the Burgermeister&quot; are inexplicably absent. (&quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; is on here in the 1990 re-recorded version, with Peter solo on piano.)<br />Gripe 3: there is not a single song from &quot;Peter Gabriel 2&quot;. Can you say &quot;selective memory&quot;? (The album was also overlooked on the 1990 &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot; compilation.) &quot;On The Air&quot; and &quot;DIY&quot; should have been included on this &quot;definitive&quot; collection.<br />Gripe 4: While there are 4 songs from &quot;Us&quot;, missing in action nevertheless are &quot;Kiss the Frog&quot; (a genuine hit, actually), and &quot;Come Talk to Me&quot;, an essential song in Peter's catalogue.<br />This by no means implies that the music on this collection is not good, not at all. There are many great songs on here. In addition to many familiar songs, the unreleased &quot;Burn You Up, Burn You Down&quot; is a great track, with heavy grooves, and &quot;Lovetown&quot; (from the 1994 &quot;Philadelphia&quot; soundtrack) is another gem, and appears for the first time on a Peter Gabriel record.

0385508417|5.0|I find that the negative reviewers have missed the point that this is just a fun little story about how commercialized Christmas has become.  This is not a story to take too seriously - the characters are intentionally over-the-top and the situation is supposed to be overly silly just to emphasize the point that people who take Christmas very seriously are silly themselves.<br />  Most of us don't live on a street that competes with other streets to win the best light display but many of us have seen them.  Initially, our impression is wonder and awe at the grandiose displays.  But then reality sets in and we think about the type of people who would engage in such meaningless contests.  We think - aren't they taking this a little too far?  Can they sleep at night with all the &quot;festivities&quot; and attention.  And most importantly, would I ever want to live on a street like this?  Could I escape if I did?  Welcome to the Krank's world.  What was once a peaceful community has now become obsessed with Christmas.  Look around you though, how many obligations do you have that you wish you didn't have to deal with? Would you really be able to tune everything out or would the guilt and pressure of Christmas obligations ultimately prevail?<br />  In short, this book pokes fun at how we have become obsessed with trivialities that have nothing to do with what Christmas is supposed to be about.  At the same time, it has a cute message that speaks about Christmas spirit and what it is supposed to be about, not what it has actually become.<br />  It's a well written satire with an interesting commentary about the world we live in.  This is a fun book that shouldn't be taken too seriously.  Anyone who does probably takes Christmas too seriously and has missed the whole point of why this book is funny.  I laughed out loud many times.  This book is very funny if you just lighten up.
0226039331|5.0|The third edition of this classic work contains even more examples, citations, and helps than the second edition.

B0000CAQ27|5.0|P!nk's back and better than ever! Being that I am a rap/R&amp;B fan, I don't really go for too much rock.  But this is definitely an exception! I love this album, and in my opinion, it's better that her last 2! I'm not saying that her last 2 were bad, but this one is definitely new and improved! The tracks:<br />Trouble  10/10 - I consider this one my ANTHEM! <br />God Is a DJ  10/10 - Love this song, it could do good as a single.<br />Last to Know  10/10 - This is an EASY hit.<br />Tonight's the Night  9.5/10 - Nice song that troubled people can relate to.<br />Oh My God  9/10 - THIS one is interesting, nice and mellow.<br />Catch Me While I'm Sleeping  8/10 - Nice and smooth R&amp;B groove on this one.<br />Waiting for Love  20/10 - This is my FAVORITE one on the album! Her vocals are REALLY powerful.<br />Save My Life  10/10 - Really sad song, nice fast but mellow beat.<br />Try Too Hard  10/10 - Classic Avril Lavigne or possibly Michelle Branch sound, nice beat.<br />Humble Neighborhoods  10/10 - Excellent for parties, definitely a club anthem!<br />Walk Away  9/10 - Another classic Avril Lavigne / Michelle Branch sound, good song though not as good as &quot;Try Too Hard&quot;.<br />Unwind  7.5/10 - This song has a nice beat but her voice is a bit raspy with the music, which makes it a bit difficult to enjoy to the full extent.<br />Love Song  8/10 - Nice slow song, but it's rather short!!<br />Hooker  10/10 - Now THIS ONE is interesting! Fast beat with a nice groove, but it appears as she is dissing Christina Aguilera!<br />All in all this album is good.  If you want a new P!nk sound, then you should definitely &quot;Try This&quot;!!

B000002N2Z|4.0|This Deftones album, &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, is a piece of the base that forms the nu-metal pyramid.  It partly holds all of the other bands of their time, and future bands to come.<br />&quot;Adrenaline&quot; starts out with a subtle bang as &quot;Bored&quot; begins with it's growling guitar intro. Then it sends you into an even louder and heavier journey that lasts until the final note in &quot;Fireal&quot;.  <br />Chino's emotions are felt through listening to this album like no other.  Each song has its own tone and its own personality.  You don't even have to listen to the lyrics, you just just feel it in the words.  <br />With talent like that, talent that can reach out, grab the listener, and throw them against the wall...it's impossible not to give this album a five star rating.  <br />If you heard the Deftones on the radio, or heard about them from a friend, go pick up this album.  If you like this one, be sure to check out &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, &quot;White Pony&quot;, and the self titled.
B000000OAL|5.0|Queen's debut is one of those truly original recordings that can never be duplicated. Even for Queen, this is truly original, as they quickly departed this unique sound for bigger and better things. Don't let this fool you, though. For 1973, this is a wonderful CD with excellent songs and musicianship. Looking at the opening track, Keep Yourself Alive, we have a guitar driven tune (with a very unique strumming sound) that rocks all the way through the end--including a keep-up-the-tempo drum solo from Roger Taylor that quickly solidifies him as one of rock's foremost drummers. The songs are exquisite: Doin All Right, a cover of the original Smile song that Brian May recorded along with Taylor and bandmate Tim Staffell. The Night Comes Down, and Jesus, are both heavy rockers that unfortunately were left off Queen sets after the album was released, never to be played again. Liar, a staple for many years for Queen, is a 6-minute operatic rocker that paved the way for the Bohemian Rhapsodies of the future. My Fairy Queen is perhaps the most interesting song on the CD, a piano-vocal driven operatic tune that is simply good fun to listen to. We also have a snippet of Seven Seas Of Rhye, a song that eventually appears on their second release, Queen 2. Modern Times Rock and Roll is a Roger Taylor penned fast rocker that lived in their sets for a few years, and Son and Daughter, another constant in the early Queen sets, gave home to Brian May's guitar solo until Brighton Rock appeared on their third album. The best song here, however, is Great King Rat, which is the most progressive song on the CD, and actually appeared on and off in Queen sets through the 80's.<br />Queen's debut is a must for all Queen fans, plus fans of early Queen when they were still trying to decide which direction to take their music.

As if a hurricane and his own widowhood weren't enough the island in question contains nothing but a mental hospital for the criminally insane.<br />The hero, Teddy, quickly grows ill-at-ease with the condescending attitude displayed by the staff of the hospital.  Some of the patients assert that they are innocent victims being held against their will. On top of that Teddy's own partner seems to know more of what is going on than he is willing to share.<br />Some have said that this was a shocking book with a surprise ending but I could see where it was heading fairly quickly. I thought that there were a lot of contrivances and of course the big surprise was a bit of a let down.<br />It was a good pot-boiler type of mystery and I read through it quickly enough that I can't say it was a waste of time.  \\"Shutter Island\\" is a good beach read but will never make it into the annals of great literature.
078681859X|5.0|This is a great book. You know when you read a book and after the first five pages you KNOW it's going to be awesome? That's what happened for me here. A small boy conjures a demon to steal an amulet. Little does the boy know what the amulet is worth.<br />Set in \\"another\\" London, where magic is a way of life for some people (the Prime Minister is a magician), this book focuses on Nathanial (the boy) and Bartimaeus (the demon). Where Nathanial is dark, vengeful and serious, Bartimaeus is dark, vengeful and funny. He doesn't take things too seriously and, hey, why should he when he's been around for thousands of years and will probably be around for thousand more?<br />It's hard with fantasy novels to describe imaginary things so that they're believable and so that the reader follows along. I had to no trouble with this book. The imps, the magic, the transformations, all of it was extremely entertaining and well played out. Bartimaeus even injects many footnotes into his narration and I didn't find unevenness in that.<br />All I can say is that I'm so glad this is going to be a trilogy. I cannot wait for the next one. Bartimaeus is a very funny demon and Stroud weaves an engrossing tale.

With this movie having a bigger budget than the last one, this movie had to be better than X1 (which is also a good movie) I liked the way Nightcrawler was introduced to us and the action sequence that followed when he tried to assassinate the president while under the control of the main enemy, Gen. Stryker. I also liked the fact that they let Wolverine be Wolverine and unleash his violent nature when the X-Mansion is attacked in the first half of the movie. The only problems I had with the movie was that there wasn't enough of Cyclops and I wish Gambit would've been in the movie. But hey, there's alway X3. If you love comic book movies, this one is definitely for you. For the hardcore fans, in certain scenes, it also gives you little things you can notice certain things regarding other mutants and teams like X-Force, X-Factor, etc..., that fairweather fans would never know about. Bottom line, the commericials are correct. This is the #1 DVD. Don't miss it.

There would be no Britney Spears without Madonna, adio Carisima
B0000DZEE3|5.0|An amazing performance in front of 80,000 eager fans.  They sound absolutly incredible.  Anthony's singing is dead on.  John and Flea's jams are second to none.  Watch the intro solo to Around the World.  Flea has more chops than most guitarist I've seen.  The jam-into to Californication is awsome too.  They play almost every song from their By The Way album and some from Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  The DvD sound is flawless.  You can feel the energy just as if you were at the concert.  They editors also put in this cool bullet time effect where they'd freeze a frame (Ex. Flea in midair) and rotate the camera angle.  For any Chili Pepper fan this DvD is a must.  Especially if you want The Chili Peppers at their absolute best.
B000063CPL|4.0|Don't get me wrong, Rock in Rio is a great live album. The fact that Iron Maiden can draw enough fans to drown out Bruce's voice on the Wicker Man (250,000+) after more than 20 years is amazing and a testament to how great they are. I just prefer Live After Death. The setlist on Live After Death is a million times better than the list for Rock in Rio. I was disappointed to hear so many songs from Brave New World and not enough classics. In general though, Rock in Rio is great...<br />Rock in Rio = 4 out of 5 stars<BR>Live After Death = 5.5 out of 5, its that good
B00004WGY9|1.0|... but it just isn't very good. Rowland's self-indulgent singing style is too grating for their strong horn section to cover up. He's all over the friggin' map. The song writing is mostly forgettable. I have to say I can't understand why a few people love this album so much. It's such a far cry from the band's inspirations (per the liner notes) - the 1960's soul greats in America. I actually like their/his next album, Too Rye Aye, but this was disappointing. If you want UK soul go for Van Morrison.
B00005QB42|5.0|Yet another wonderful cd by Deva Premal. The songs seem to flow over me like colorful silk scraves waving in the wind.  They're fun, upbeat and dancy in some, soft, thoughtful, introspective in others.  Its a great compilation that's simply beatiful.  I can listen to it over and over!
B000002H97|5.0|This was the first Metallica album I got, and it was the album that got me introduced to a lot of amazing music. Each song has a special something about it-really great album, awesome solos.<br />Enter Sandman-An awesome song, the chorus is great, the guitar part is sick...I love it. The &quot;Exit light, enter night&quot; really got me. 9.5/10<BR>Sad but True-Good song, but not the greatest. Good lyrics. 8/10<BR>Holier Than Thou-A headbanging song, one of the first Metallica songs I got into. 9.5/10<BR>The Unforgiven-A.m.a.z.i.n.g song..I loved it the moment I heard it. Slow song, really nice guitar part, the lyrics are really nice. 10/10<BR>Wherever I May Roam-Awesome solo, I love hearing it. Love the intro, and the whole song. 10/10<BR>Don't Tread on Me-OK song...not the best. 8/10<BR>Through the Never-I love the confusing mehem of this song, it's a crazy song, but really fun. 9/10<BR>Nothing Else Matters-This is a really beautiful song-it was the first one I learned on guitar. The solo is really pretty...the lyrics are great, and they gave a lot of feeling into this song. 10/10<BR>Of Wolf and Man-This one took a little while to grow on me, but boy, it grew on me. I can play this on repeat over and over again and not get sick of it. 9.5/10<BR>The God that Failed-These have really really interesting lyrics, and is a good song. 10/10<BR>My Friend of Misery-Good song, not great. 8/10<BR>The Struggle Within-Awesome solo. 9/10
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead is back, and Hail to the Thief could not be a more perfect fit in their succession of magnificent work.  Once again they prove themselves to be the most innovative band around by pushing their style to new heights.  Blending electronica with experimental indie rock results in quite a fabulous listen.  This album covers the gamut of emotions from infectious grooves (A Punchup at a Wedding, There There), to very intense rock (2+2=5, Sit down. Stand up.), to more relaxed somber moments (Sail to the Moon, Scatterbrain), and very eerie moments (We suck Young Blood).  The album closer, 'A Wolf at the Door', could quite possibly be the best song that I have ever heard.  If you listen to this album with headphones on, you'll be completely blown away, but not quite as blown away as if you had seen them perform live.  Give it a shot...right now!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I admit, I get down around the Holidays because of the loss of my Mother, but this Album is certainly something to help keep your spirits high. When I say she sangs through this Album, I mean the girl sangs! She has made these classics her own as she does with every song she sings. She changed them without taking anything away from them but like only a &quot;Great&quot; can do, she added to them. Her voice BANGS! on &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, and she cruises through &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; like a mid-night ride down the yellow brick road. Full of Pure Emotion and Skilled Vocal, &quot;One Wish- The Holiday Album&quot; is a MUST!
0140430148|3.0|I enjoyed this book for about the first two-thirds and then it became remarkably tedious. For the last third I really just wanted it to be over. Some of the characters are fantastic and funny and interesting and some are just plain dull. I think &quot;The Woman in White&quot; is a much better book and  would recommend it over this long-winded mystery.
0767830555|4.0|Whoa!! Fireball performance by De Niro, competent direction by Martin Scorcese and good supporting performances by Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel - all the elements which worked together in bringing out this classic.<br />De Niro is the lonely guy who takes a one-way ticket to the loony bin when he is shunned by the world. The world around him is too busy to take notice of him and his loneliness turns into frustration, then into desperation and culminates in psychosis. He becomes in hell-bent in rescuing a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her way of life and shoots up some pimps and low-life along the way. That is Taxi Driver in a nutshell, but what makes this great is how all the actors literally live their roles and make us feel as if they are just on candid camera. You feel a bonding with De Niro since once in a lifetime, everyone goes thru this patch of neglected loneliness.<br />The DVD specials consist of the usual fare - making, storyboards, trailers etc. There was some problem with my DVD and I couldn't see the 'making' completely. But it was good till the point I had seen, so no gripes. Get the DVD!!
B000002LIX|5.0|Sadly enough, I didn't get into this band until last year, when a friend of mine had introduced me to them. I had first listened to this while I was stoned. &quot;Three Days&quot; and &quot;Then She Did...&quot; haunted me. The next day, I had to listen. I only have the cassete (mostly cause i drive a lot and i wish to have a cassete more then a cd) and I would skip over &quot;Three Days&quot; a lot, my favorite song being &quot;Then She Did...&quot; Well, &quot;Three Days&quot; was an epic. It changed me when I first heard it. This whole album changed me. Now, when it comes down to Nothing's Shocking and Ritual De Lo Habitual, there is no better. They're both very different, very unique albums that explore different areas of the bands talents and experiments. <BR>The whole album from start to finish is perfection. I have to sing to every song when I hear them. It's my favorite Rock album of the 90's. Nevermind and Ten has nothing on Ritual De Lo Habitual, and they never will. Jane's Addiction helped Alternative Rock evolve. <BR>Before you praise Nirvana or Pearl Jam or anyone else for that matter, look back a bit and praise the ones who started it all...<BR>BUY THIS ALBUM, NOW!
B0000DC151|1.0|HBO is trying to make a buck off all the suckers who will pay full price for a half season, and the most uninspired, filler season at that.  I'm sure they will combine season 5 and 6 and offer that as a package next year, so save your $$$$ and buy shoes instead!
B000066NW0|1.0|You know... I don't care what you like, and i'm sure you don't care what I like. If you really do, by all means, contact me. This stated... why does music like this get made? Is it because Avril realized an easy way to make money by sucker punching kids and teens alike that can't think for themselves and get better music? Let's face it, Avril doesn't rock, and whatever you want to call her, she's anything but cool or hard or rocking.<br />In the end, it comes down to this: Avril will eventually fade away like these other no talent acts. If you want to continue buying this album and help out her master plan to get rich fast, go right ahead. I'm not taking part.<br />P.S.: shut the hell up about what's punk and what's not. Nobody cares to hear it.
0876852630|5.0|Another Classic. A series of jobs and weird situations during the 4o's in America. He dispatches the end of WWII with a sentence or two!
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana didn't break the mold for Alternative/Grunge/Punk/Hard Rock or whatever you want to call it. Do any of you ignorant fans not take into account the grounds that Nothing's Shocking and Ritual De Lo Habitual broke when they both came out? Jane's Addiction revolutionized rock.<BR>Nirvana isn't that great, Kurt has no range or good pitch, Kurt couldn't play the guitar that well, the songs in this are just a bunch of his poems (with some other additions) thrown together, and basically, this album blows. Why do people insist on making it one of the greatest albums of the 90's? If you ask me, it just ruined a band that couldn't have been ruined anymore. <br />Songs not to check out: All of them. Don't buy this cd, no matter what anyone says to you.
0385504209|5.0|This murder mystery set against a religious conspiracy theory wastes no time is getting started. It's an incredible page-turner tapping into religious history, architecture and, of course, Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings. I terrific holiday gift for anyone who enjoys plot-driven suspense novels! Don't hesitate to put down your money on this one! Also recommended: Life of Pi by Martel, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B00005OWEG|5.0|In my humble opinion APOCALYPSE NOW is one of the ten greatest films of all time, and the re-inclusion of the legendary missing scenes in REDUX only adds to the spellbinding experience of this towering work of art. The numbing decadence and creeping sense of imminent defeat at the French plantation, the bizarre and heartbreaking Bunny scenes, and Colonel Kilgore's comic attempts to reclaim his stolen surfboard add color and heft to an already amazing journey. I, however, will not buy APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX on DVD until Mr. Coppola does this masterpiece the justice it deserves: a deluxe repackaging a la the GODFATHER films is not only in order, but long overdue. May I suggest, for 2004, a 25th Anniversary Special Edition DVD including:<br />1. Both the original and REDUX cuts of the film.<br />2. HEARTS OF DARKNESS: A FILMMAKER'S APOCALYPSE, Eleanor Coppola's brilliant documentary on the filming of APOCALYPSE NOW.<br />3. Commentary tracks by Coppola, Martin Sheen, sound editor Walter Murch, Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro and anyone else they can get.<br />4. Rehearsal footage, Cannes footage, the complete screenplay, stills, and whatever else Mr. Coppola feels is appropriate for the edition.<br />If ever a film was crying out for a proper DVD treatment, it's APOCALYPSE NOW.
B00005JMFR|4.0|After the cliffhanger ending of the \\"Matrix Reloaded\\", this third and final entry in the Wachowski Brothers' movie trilogy is a fantastic but controversial closer to this stunning movie series. The machines under control of the renegade program Agent Smith are fast approaching the underground city of Zion where the last remains of humanity takes its last stand against them, while Agent Smith is gaining more power by the minute. Neo is now the only one who can be able to defeat Smith for good. However, he is trapped somewhere outside the regular world and the Matrix on a mysterious train station and a very unpleasant individual called the Trainman who controls the train station can free him from there. After much hell, they manage to free Neo from the train station and now Neo must fight and defeat Agent Smith once and for all as he is the only one who can truly save humanity from total extinction. This might sound a little too close to being similar in plot to \\"The Terminator\\" but this isn't time-traveling like from those movies.<br />The special effects on this movie are amazing but at times can really go over the top. I especially love the scenery and the way the ship moves through the various tunnels. I've also felt that this movie is much darker than the last two Matrix movies and at times, it even reminds me of the creepiness of \\"Event Horizon\\" from a few years back. The massive battle scenes are just awesome and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time they occur.<br />I know Neo is one of the center characters and Keanu Reeves does such an excellent job at bringing Neo to life but from my opinion, it's Hugo Weaving who really steals the spotlight. Weaving does such a fantastic job at playing the numerous replicates of Agent Smith that he easily tosses just about everyone else on the cast into orbit around the earth. I must say, outside of playing Elrond, I will forever remember Hugo Weaving here as he can really play some frightening bad guys and this movie proves just that. Weaving is scary as the dangerous program Agent Smith. The rest of the actors/ actresses except for Bellucci (Persephone) and the guy, who played Merovingian, do pretty well.<br />As awesome as this is, there are quite a few gripes I have with this movie. First, with such a wide variety of different realities and high number of questions that the previous two left us wondering, \\"Revolutions\\" only seemed to answer a few of them yet also created a whole new trainload of new questions that are never answered. The ending even if this is the final trilogy, doesn't seem to quite give a sense of the danger now gone for good but I guess these things were the purpose. On the other hand, I can see why they didn't have so everything is answered as it would be just about impossible to have answers handed over in real life. I can also understand why it is confusing as this movie was designed to make one figure out what was going on and how fate is almost impossible to escape. Very disappointed.<br /> I felt gravely disappointed with Merovingian and Persephone. We saw Persephone help Morpheus Neo and Trinity and kill one of Merovingian's henchmen but here, she was just totally dumbed-down to just a deaf mute character on here and the couple only appear for about may a few minutes altogether. I expected a lot more out of these two, whether Persephone would battle her husband or betray Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. I felt hugely disappointed with these two and felt that this movie could have done without them. I especially hated the way she looked on this movie. The repulsive outfit that she wore looked so tight that those busts looked like they would have their blood circulation cut off. Yergh! Bellucci was good in the \\"Reloaded\\" movie but here, she has brought along some of the emptiest acting that I've seen in many years.<br />The main flaw in this movie is that with such a HUGE dimensions that this movie tackles, just the two hour and fifteen minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg. I think that this movie would've been so much better had it been extended for at least another half hour or even up to over three hours long. Perhaps the movie studios are planning on releasing Platinum Extended Editions with new footage incorporated into the movies the way they did with \\"Lord of the Rings\\", I don't know but I felt that \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" length doesn't do it a lot of justice. For what it is, \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" is awesome, but it could really have been an outstanding epic finale. This is a definite must-own movie whenever it comes out on DVD but I feel that this had a lot of room for improvement and that they blew their chance at it. Then again maybe they are planning on releasing an extended edition of this movie in the foreseeable future to make up for the flaws on here. I can understand how many were disappointed with this movie but even then, this doesn't deserve the high number of negative reviews.<br />It's still a very good movie and the tons and tons of awesome action, battle scenes along with the tons of fun in this film make up for the missteps on here but the missteps are bigger than those in \\"Reloaded\\". They created a fantastic trilogy that well definitely be sci-fi classics in the years to come. Go and see this movie today. Just don't expect anything near perfection and if you can get by some of the major flaws, this is just an awesome movie. I can't wait to have all three of these movies once they are all on DVD.n minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg.

0380977788|5.0|Coraline was my first foray into the world of Neil Gaiman. I was stuck, just waiting for Robin McKinley or Philip Pullman's next work to come out.  Coraline came to me through a classroom book order form geared towards 4th through 6th grade, and I'd heartily agree with that age determination. <br />I purchased Coraline as a potential read aloud novel in my classroom or to add to my classroom library.  While I quickly determined this was not the book for a third grader, no matter what their reading ability, I thoroughly enjoyed this book as an adult reader.<br />Neil Gaiman has created a fantasy world set in an old Victorian-like house that has been turned into flats.  Coraline is slowly likeable as the bored and out of sorts child who wanders into a second world connected to her house via a spooky little corridor. Coraline finds most things in this new world mirror those in her own, including a set of \\"other\\" parents. Gaiman's use of language never lets you get lost as you try to sort out the two worlds, even when Coraline becomes trapped in the increasingly dangerous (and creepy) second world.<br />As per usual in a fantasy novel, the young heroine is aided not only by her own disinterest in doing what she ought, but also by a cast of characters who provide both advice and \\"magical\\" trinkets. My third grade students would have loved this adventure. It was written well enough for most of them to follow it, but I couldn't be entirely sure some of the more sinister elements wouldn't have caused some scary dreams. Alas, this one will stay at home with me and I'll have to find a different adventure for our read aloud. My gain.<br />I recommend this book for middle-school aged children and would probably argue against it for those parents searching for material for their \\"advanced\\" but chronologically younger readers. I completed this book in the air between New England and Chicago; this is a one sitting read for adults.  I'll be heading to the Neil Gaiman aisle of my local bookstore again soon.<br />Black buttons.....brrrr.
B0000524EM|5.0|I own everything on the Crow!
B00005JM02|5.0|\\"I'm gonna get ya!\\"  You hear from Dory the Blue Tang as she sees a floating light in the depths of the ocean.  Even Dory's levelheaded companion Marlin is mesmerized by the view.   Perhaps the best animated movie for all ages, Finding Nemo, is action-packed and full of laughter.  Though the movie was geared towards children, I was suprised how enjoyable it was to older generations as well.   <BR>As a single parent, Marlin the clownfish was very protective of his son, Nemo.  On Nemo's first day of school, while wondering out into open water, he was taken by some divers onto their boat.  Marlin then began his journey to recover his terrified son.  While still in shock and dismantled he has a head-on collision with a fish with short term memory loss (Dory).  As Dory and Marlin set out on their adventure, Nemo is thrown in a fish tank inside a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia.  While dodging sharks, deep-sea anglers, jellyfish, and much more, Dory and Marlin become famous to the marine life.  Throughout this time, Nemo and his new tank friends try to develop plans in order to escape the tank before its too late.<BR>One of the last things Marlin said to his wife, Coral, was the statement, \\"OK, we can name one Nemo, but I would like most of them to be called Marlin, Jr.\\"  Shortly after, a shark causes Coral's untimely death, along with all their children except one, who Marlin names Nemo in his wife's memory.  The tragedy of the whole story is a good contrast for the funny aspect.  However bad you felt when Coral dies, you feel ten times worse when you see Marlin lose all he had left.   <BR>Despite the sad aspect, comedy plays a very large roll in the movie.  If you enjoy silly jokes, or seeing familiar personalities in a cartoon setting, you will laugh your socks off.  From young fish getting the words \\"butt\\" and \\"boat\\" confused, to Dory constantly forgetting what is happening there is no funnier Pixar film yet.  I believe the reason I enjoyed this movie so much was because of the comedy.  It is mature enough for adults, yet simple enough for children.<BR>In this memorable tale, you feel many emotions.  Happiness, sadness, you name it.  The strong story line keeps your interest throughout the full hour and forty-minute film.  It is amazing how talented the people at Pixar are, and I must give them snaps for their courageous ideas.  I absolutely loved this DVD, with its fun extras and especially the short film called \\"Knick Knack\\".  I would recommend it to people of any age, it's a great family film.
0452282152|4.0|Lanie Schalbe has written an excellent review of Girl with The Pearl Earring. Read that review for a well-considered overview of the book. I would like to add a few points to her review: first, I found the main character, Griet, well developed and likeable. I didn't have any problem \\"getting into her skin\\" and seeing things as she did. However, I was amused at the way in which she kept her pursuer Pieter at arms length so long. I think that was a little unbelieveable. In real life, she most likely would have jumped at the chance to become his wife, even with his stained fingernails. It was a matter of eating well and caring for her stricken family.<br />Peripheral characters were not as well-drawn, particularly Griet's brother and sister. When they left, I couldn't sense the pain she must have felt.<br />When I was in The Netherlands, I was enchanted by the architecture and the canals. The architecture of the place captivated me. I wanted more of this backdrop for the scenes of this book, from the perspective of the author's art appreciation background. And street markets are lively and noxious at once. Scenes that occurred in the street market of Delft were fairly sterile in the narrative.<br />But those are minor considerations when stacked against the positive attributes of this book. Although I was familiar with some of the works by Vermeer, I knew little about the man, his time, nor of what it took to create even the colors of his painting (or of all paintings of this era). Just that was well worth spending time with this book. Previously, because of the typical subjects of Vermeer paintings, I did not rank him very high on my list of favorites. The author deftly brings a new appreciation of his art.<br />The life of a maid of the times was thorough and very interesting. The vivid descriptions of family life, and a maid's lot within the family, were the very foundation of the book.<br />The most sublime parts of the book, however, were Griet's coming to understand the genius of the man, and to even subtly assist him in coming to see what she knew he would eventually realize about his own works in progress. I say sublime because the author combines an intelligent young girl with her daily duties of placing and re-placing his settings after cleaning them, along with her history of long talks with her artist father. For me, this is the very essence of the book and explains her attraction to him, as intelligence is attracted to genius. And it, combined with the conventions of 1600's Netherlands, explains and makes acceptable so much of the author's beliefs about her subjects.<br />This is a very good read. Although some have called it a fast read, I believe it called for some relevant thinking about what exactly was happening to Griet, as the author wisely did not spoon-feed the reader her conclusions, but let us discover them on our own.and the genius of the man, and to even subtly assist him in coming to see what she knew he would eventually realize about his own works in progress.

B0000CEB62|3.0|101 is in my opinon, an overrated DM release. I was somewhat dissapointed when i bought it. The DVD contains some classic live songs (shake the disease, stripped) but the overall quality of the live concert and the way the concert is shot is average at best. Most songs are only about 1/2 the live performance, and the other half is just weird filler such as random people dancing or talking.<br />Personally, i would have enjoyed a &quot;One night in paris&quot; style DVD much more, but this is an ok buy just to see some of the classic songs you've listened to over and over on the 101 double disk set.
B00008PW2D|2.0|Still as good as always, but I just can't believe there are only 2 discs!!!  Very short season... not sure if it's worth the money... really disappointed!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This movie is really much more than a story of the Old West, although it is that and masterfully so. It deals with issues such as the different natures of human individuals, redemption, revenge, ego, etc. Clint Eastwood's character is a violent, cold-blooded killer even though he desperately does not want to be. He is not cruel or obnoxious, he simply has no compunctions about killing. His young partner, &quot;The Schofield Kid&quot;, is the gentle person that William Munny (Eastwood) wants to be, even though the kid himself desperately wants to be a ruthless killer like Munny. But it's not as simple as that. Because even after Munny decides he must use his &quot;knack&quot; for murder to complete his &quot;mission&quot; he is rusty and incompetent. He misses shots and gets pushed around. It is only after a bout of illness and a return to drinking that he becomes a one-man army bent of avenging his friend's death. So really the movie shows how even our very basic natures as individuals are nebulous and elusive. The movie also has moments of great humor, mostly involving another wannabe villain (although with a little more credibility than The Schofield Kid), the effete &quot;English Bob&quot; and his flunkey biographer. The movie also ties Bob and his biographer's story in with the mythologization of &quot;The Old West&quot; and how the violence that really existed during that period was much more savage and much less glamorous than is recorded. In this way William Munny also sets himself apart as one of the very few (or perhaps only) &quot;real deals&quot;. It's doubtful another decent Western can be made after this movie, which has such an air of finality about it. It is an obituary of a genre, albeit a profound and deeply moving one, from a true cinematic legend.
6305823839|5.0|A little background information regarding this DVD edition:  When the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; movie first came to video back in the '90's we were tantalized on this side of the Atlantic Ocean by an alternate version of the video known (informally) as &quot;the green version&quot;.  Essentially it was the same movie, but the video itself included additional footage in the form of deleted scenes and interview footage with the director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew Macdonald.

B00009W0U4|1.0|I'm still not sure what to make of this movie.  It could, on many levels, be considered a masterpiece because the images are quite simply stuck in my head.  The movie will not leave you alone and will follow you everywhere you go after having seen it.  I guess, this is one measure of a true masterpiece: something so moving you cannot and do not simply forget it after the credits roll.  On the other hand, you could look at this movie as a gargantuan piece of [expletive deleted] that much like the Howard Stern show is shocking for the sake of being shocking.  I had heard nothing about this movie and simply saw the \\"Two Thumbs Up\\" quote on the cover. So, how I sat through the first forty five minutes of this thing is an incredible act of intestinal fortitude on my part.  I will give you a little bit of the plot because it will in no way prepare you for this movie: this is basically a rape / revenge movie told in reverse order much like Memento.  Most of the revenge part takes place at the beginning of the film in a deep, dark, back alley, gay, S&M club aptly named \\"Rectum\\".  Now here's the rub again.  The hand held, poorly focused, poorly lit camera work combined with the strident, throbbing sound track gives the viewer the feeling they're in the \\"Rectum,\\" so to speak.  There is palpable feeling of anger, violence and disgust as you watch this movie.  You can almost feel the squish of splooge under your feet as the protagonist runs through the club seeking his revenge on the rapist.  This does have it's desired effect and is probably why some will consider this a masterpiece.  On the other hand, if I were a cleaver, right wing, conservative looking to attack the left from the left.  I would dress myself up as an \\"artiste\\", start speaking with a foreign accent, go out, and make this movie.  Simply because all your self-righteous, nose in the air, liberal, intelligencia patrons will herald you as the \\"next great thing\\" all the while you're sending out the message that homosexuals are a dirty, nasty, underground group of deviants that need to be driven out of the dark holes where they congregate and beaten to death.  The movie gets even more graphic as it moves backwards through time (which I didn't think could be possible).  I somehow struggled through the entire thing, uncomfortable and uneasy with every passing frame.  So, again the rub.  The movie was supposed to make you uncomfortable and it did.  It is an incredible piece of film making.  However, I have more respect for porn movies because they are, at least, honest about themselves. You know what you're getting into when you buy one. This movie dresses itself up in all the ersatz trappings of \\"art\\" and is still just porn with violence.  I personally think there are some things that simply don't need to be made into a movie and this is one of them.mosexuals are a dirty, nasty, underground group of deviants that need to be driven out of the dark holes where they congregate and beaten to death.

0767818040|4.0|This movie was good because it had a lot of nudity and the best parts were when they switched stories from one to another.  There was one story where the director was shooting a vampire movie.  The other was in his head - he had something else going on involving a murder.
B000004727|5.0|I'm very new to flamenco guitar playing but I have to say (with this being my second Paco album) I like &quot;Siroco&quot; just a tad bit better than &quot;Almoraima&quot;.  Both are very excellent albums!!  I'm a huge music fan and even though I don't know a whole lot about the flamenco history I know good music when I hear it and this album is it!

B00003CX5P|1.0|I have never been so disappointed in a film in all my life. It makes me wish that there were an ability to give negative stars.  The reason it gets even one positive star however is the opening few minutes.  It actually looked like it would be a great film.  NO...IT REALLY WASN'T. After that one brief shining moment this film tanks into a CG nightmare of effects without substance.  It looked like the entire thing was developed to as an excuse to create that racing scene which was in turn developed just to sell a stupid video game.  That racing SCENE...what was it...half an hour?  And the &quot;comical&quot; announcer.  A CURSE ON YOUR RANCH GEORGE LUCAS!!!  With the exception of the aformentioned 3-5 minutes of action and excitement  every other moment was an agony of disillusionment and the systematic sulying of beloved memories.
B00005JM02|4.0|After his wife and all-but-one of his offspring get devoured by a Barracuda, the unfunny clownfish Marlin turns into the over-protective father of his last remaining son Nemo (who was named based on his wife's wish). <br />During the very first day of school, Nemo is dared by a few friends to swim towards a boat. Seeing how his dad is already butting in, he goes a tad further than his buds bargained for, and is caught by a diver. <br />The only clue Marlin has as to the new whereabouts of his son is an address written on the back of the diving mask lost by the guy who captured his son. Determined to get Nemo back, he then sets out on a long trip to find him.<br />Along the way he meets a fish with a terrible short-term memory, a 'fish are friends' shark-group, and a bunch of surfer turtles (\\"Yeah, dude\\"), while Nemo can be found in a fish-tank surrounded by such oddities as old-timer Gill (Willem Dafoe), and French hermit crab Jacques who has a cleaning fetish.<br />Disney's animation team really outdid itself with the animations. Everything in the movie seems to have been made with utter care for detail; in the back, often seagrass can be seen moving to the current, reflections look natural, fish move the way you expect them to move (Well. Mostly, anyway), and there's a gorgeous look at Sydney's bay included. <br />The 'recipe' of the movie is one that has been used numerous times: Take a hero, add a quest, toss in a bunch of funny critters who help him/her, mix it with a tad of adventure, a pinch of bad guys, a tad of romance, and a humour-cherry on top. Still, the viewer doesn't get a 'seen this before' feeling.<br />Overall, it's a funny and entertaining movie. Kids ought to love this, but Disney made sure older viewers will also be kept interested, even if it's just by the stunning visuals and the little references to other movies (\\"HEEEEEEERE'S BRUCEY!\\").

B0000DZ3IG|3.0|I just made the purchase of this album and have to say that I'm quite disappointed. The MAIN reason I purchased this album was to hear two of the bonus tracks: the Billy Mack and Olivia Olson ones. Truthfully, I am happier listening to the movie version. Both are watered down studio versions. <br />The Billy Mack track is missing the Motown backup singers until the very end. The backup singers are what gave the song its sarcastic sentimentality and the song is nothing without them. <br />Furthermore, the prodigious Olivia Olson is greatly insulted by her being overpowered by the instrumentals of the song along with her voice being thinned by artificial echo. <br />The rest of the CD is great, but if you really loved these two song as you originally heard them, then I would suggest just purchasing the DVD when it comes out and rewatching the scenes.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|After hearing Howard Shore's stunning conclusion to Perter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, I can only state one thing: Excellent.  Excellent doesn't really do justice to the magnificence of Shore's work.  Like another classic trilogy score (Williams from Return of the Jedi), Shore presents a much more mature version of work.  All our favorite themes are there:  The Fellowship theme has now evolved into a wistful yet powerful fanfare for Aragorn.  The Shire theme makes a return as does the Hobbit theme, both played magnificently by James Galway.  Also returning is the Mordor theme, it's menacing notes now grown into a malevolent force.  The Rohan theme also makes a brief reappearance, while the elvish theme comes to a full circle, representing Aragorn as he gets his sword in the track Andruil.   The beginning of the cd is much more playful than that of the Two Towers, but it swiftly transforms into a majestic fanfare for Minas Tirith and Gondor which is among the greatest moments on the cd.  Once again Enya does not sing on this cd, but in a suprisingly powerful decision, Billy Boyd aka Pippin does appear, singing briefly for Lord Denethor, capturing the rift between the Steward and Faramir.  In track 17, The Return of the King, Shore takes a listener on a journey of all his developed themes for our heroes.  Absent from this cd is Sauruman's theme, the reason being because he is defeated in the Two Towers.  Also absent is the treeish theme for the Ents and Treebeard, but the absence of these themes is not at all detrimental to the cd.  As for the song at the end by Annie Lennox, it is a vast improvement over Gollum's song, but Enya's May It Be from the Fellowship soundtrack is still the best of the three.  OVerall, the first soundtrack truly is the best among fantastic cd's followed closely by The Return of the King, then Two Towers.  However, they are all exceptional and this is no exception.
B000088E6D|5.0|...comes a true original talent. The fact that he &quot;sounds like&quot; Sinatra, Torme, Darin and/or Connick, Jr. doesn't take away from that originality--it only enhances it.<BR>The first time I heard MB was in the movie &quot;Duets&quot; about a big karaoke competition (it's actually a really good movie!!), and he sings Sinatra's &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, and he's meant to sound like Sinatra (that's the gimmick!!).  Then I saw him on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot;; he sang &quot;Moondance&quot;, a song I didn't particularly like--that is until I heard MB sing it. I was COMPLETELY mesmerized!!!!!  And I went out the next day and bought this album and listened to it immediately, and I was blown away!!!  Every song was wonderfully arranged--even Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, which has a 50's flavor, fit right in with the rest. I was really impressed that Barry Gibb did the backing vocals on his &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?&quot;--that's confidence in someone covering your song.<BR>To make a long review short (I know--too late!!!), this is a GREAT CD--and shame on me for not reviewing it sooner!!!!!<BR>Regards!!!<BR>ps--can't wait to get the XMAS EP!!!!!
B00005JMF6|2.0|Here's yet another \\"spooky ghost child wants to avenge it's murder\\" flicks that seem fashionable right about now.  Frankly, this not so original plot device has grown a little long in the tooooooth.  Like many reviewers have stated, this movie actually begins well, but quickly falls into clicheland.  Every scare in this film has been done to greater effect in some earlier and better horror film.  The last third of the film relies, not on actual scares, but on those little Jump-out-of-your-pants type bursts of loud sound and action.  These consist of quick little flashes of the dead girl appearing at any given moment.  To me, this was kind of a cheap one trick pony way of doing things, but observing the audience's reaction(they jumped EVERY TIME regardless of the fact that you could see it coming a mile away!), I guess the film makers got what they set out to achieve.  Personally, I don't know how people could fall for this gag over and over again. My own girlfriend kept jumping into me, smashing my pack of Basic full flavors in the process.  This ended up being a cruddy movie.  Not Texas Chainsaw Remake cruddy, but the second half just takes the plot into territories the movie shouldn't have gone.  It becomes too derivative and outrageous to take seriously or be scared of.  For instance, this spooky ghost child wants Halle Berry to help her out in avenging her murder, but usually beats the snot out of Halle for no apparent reason when she appears to her.  What's that all about?  Plus, the villians and motivations are too stupid to buy.  If I were you, I'd stick with Stir Of Echoes, a movie that managed to conjure up some real creepiness instead of relying on startle tactics.
B0000DCGT1|5.0|This movie has been extensively reviewed but I just wanted to cast my five-star vote.  The movie is a bit like Seabiscuit -- it starts a bit slow but when it gets rolling it's a dominant winner, and well worth a bet.  The slow start even adds to the appeal. The story is well-told without being sentimental, the photography is superb, and the characterization is about as good as you can find on the circuit these days. Both times I've seen it the audience clapped at the end --once they did during the race scene -- a rare event!
B00009TB5G|1.0|Another viewer from Los Angeles, CA said it best when they wrote:<br />I just got The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended DVD Edition). I have an DVD player which plays the movie just fine (discs 1 and 2), but won't play discs 3 and 4, which are the appendices of the set. The discs in question are not defective because I'm watching them right now on my PC. OR ARE THEY?! Are these discs encoded with something new that hinders play on some units? Will New Line offer any help with this? My DVD player has never had a problem playing ANY other DVDs (including all four discs of The Fellowship of The Ring: Special Edition) but with discs 3 and 4 of TTT: Special Edition the TV screen is blank (black) while the unit jostles back and forth between titles 1 and 2 of the menu trying to figure out what to do. Apparently, I'm not the only one to experience this. On Amazon.com others have reported the same problems. <br />I've sent a version of this concern to New Line and to [...] I should suggest that other consumers having issues like this do the same. Perhaps the problem will be tended to. Haven't heard back so far.... <BR>As a loyal fan who owns both versions of both movies, I'll be returning THIS set until someone sorts it all out. Wow, after all of the work that went into packaging, marketing, and the movie itself you think they would've been a little more thorough with something like DVD compatibilty/playability. <br />And after all of that anticipation...just ridiculous.<br />HEY, NEW LINE...GET IT TOGETHER!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|You'll love the soundtrack, a pleasingly eclectic blend of genres that is bound to make you smile.<br />I found a few surprises on the CD that I didn't notice while watching the film, where the music blends in so effortlessly with the plot and the superb acting. First of all, I had dismissed Kelly Clarkson as a 15-minutes-of-famer. I didn't even realize that &quot;The Trouble With Love Is,&quot; which is so perfect in the movie, is her song. What a pleasant surprise, and how nice to be wrong!<br />Dido is one of my favorites, and her &quot;Here with Me&quot; is a strong addition to this collection, as are the offerings from Norah Jones and Eva Cassidy. The real surprise (to me, anyway) was the difference in Joni Mitchell's voice on &quot;Both Sides Now.&quot; It was so achingly perfect in the movie that I didn't realize until now that she must have re-recorded her standard. Her voice is now deeper, and has the world-weary sound of a woman who has been there, done that--perfect for the movie, and certainly a perfect match for the lyrics, but a bit jarring for this aging hippie who remembers Joni's clear, starlit voice of old.<br />Carl Wilson's brilliant &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has never failed to move me, and sounds as relevent now as it did when the Beach Boys first sang it.<br />But the REAL hit, is, of course...the inimitable Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) singing his egregious &quot;Christmas Is All Around You.&quot; I have laughed every time I have heard it--you have to see the movie to truly appreciate its nuances.<br />This is the perfect Christmas gift for a wide range of people, and I am glad to have it in my collection.
0140177396|5.0|As is true of all John Steinbeck novels, all of the stories are set in Salinas, California - Steinbeck's hometown. This is the geographic region where this prized author spent all of his time (generally outdoors) writing and observing, and was a very studious &quot;freak of nature&quot;, so to speak. A surprisingly interesting read, &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; focuses on two subjects named George and Lennie. George dreams of getting steady work on an animal farm, while his aimless, slow-witted friend (Lennie) has an ongoing desire to pet (and mangle) mice and other assorted creatures. These two take up residence with various other persons along their evasive journey as well. But, there's one pressing problem: Could George tame Lennie long enough to help make this dream a reality? You, just like our two &quot;heroes&quot;, will have to journey through the vast rivers and valleys of Salinas to find out! If you're just an average reader, like myself, you'll want to read &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; at least twice, just to understand the subtle nuances and charm of the overall story. With so much to offer, this Steinbeck tale of yore is definitely a keeper!
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one of the most motivating books on financial freedom I have read.  Kiyosaki  makes a clear case for the acquisition of income producing assets.  He believes that the single most powerful asset we have is our mind and that it doesn't matter where we start, it is how to best proceed that counts.  Since reading this book, I have increased my net worth by $230K, more than tripling my financial performance.  I also attribute this remarkable growth to another book, Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self which many reviewers had recommended.  Optimal Thinking is the mental software to make the most of opportunities and resources and minimize obstacles.

B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended version of The Two Towers is undeniably a better film than the one we watched in the cinema. At the end of the day it's impossible to give this version less than 5 stars. <br />But this review doesn't deal with the film's merits. It's an attempt to understand why the film is, ultimately, flawed - and why it doesn't manage to live up to its predecessor.<br />I think the answers to this stem from one simple but essential choice Peter Jackson has had to make: he's chosen a different approach to the story than Tolkien's.<br />Tolkien, you may remember, opted for two seperate storylines, told one after the other. The second of these deals with Frodo and Sam's journey (in)to Mordor. The first deals with the other remaining members of the Fellowship and leads to the battles at Helm's Deep and Isengard. <BR>Jackson, on the other hand, has cut up the story into three parts and then tells all three stories at one and the same time, switching from line to line and back again throughout the movie. This inevitably means that the different lines each have to be roughly equal in duration and that each line must find a resolution of sorts in a climax at the end. <br />With this approach, though, Jackson gets into trouble with all three lines. <br />His problems are least grave in the first line, since that deals with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and culminates in the natural climax of Helm's Deep. Still, all is not well even here. Had Jackson stuck to the original story he'd have been fine, but unfortunately he decided to invent new material to keep Aragorn's romance with Arwen to the fore. This material is also used to introduce a quasi-death similar to Gandalf's in Fellowship. On both counts Jackson doesn't manage things all that well: the Arwen sequences are rather muddled and distracting, whilst someone should have told Jackson that it's best not to repeat a good trick twice, lest it becomes unconvincing both times round. <br />The second line deals with Merry and Peppin in Fangorn Forest and should have been wonderful, given their encounter with Treebeard and the other Ents. But in order to have this line's climax (the attack on Isengard) coincide with the battle of Helm's Deep, Jackson has had to draw things out to the point of over-extension. The overall feeling I got when watching these sequences was that of Merry and Pippin being carried around almost endlessly through the forest until the Ents (in a precipitate and therefore unconvincing turn-around) decide to act. This line is not helped by the fact that Jackson does not seem to understand the Ents in the first place; they are presented as dim and comical, rather than ancient and wise.<br />The third line deals with Sam and Frodo (and Gollum) and must really have put Jackson in a pickle. You can merge Helm's Deep with the assault on Isengard, since they are both battles against Saruman. But where to fit in Shelob in between this? You can't, so Jackson didn't - he moved it to the third film (The Return Of the  King). That left him dangling, though, since it meant that the third line would be left without any sort of climax at all. And that's where the extraordinary re-invention of Faramir comes into play. In a far cry from Tolkien's original vision, Faramir is presented as a threat, an obstacle that Frodo and Sam must surmount to continue their quest to Mount Doom.<br />In the theatrical version, the Faramir scenes rightly left Tolkien fans reeling in horror. Faramir an enemy? Ridiculous! But it has to said that the extended version at least makes this jump comprehensible; it is here, more than anywhere else, that the extended version surpasses the original. Still, it doesn't really work, since Jackson has to leap not once, but twice, the second jump being to get Faramir to releasing Frodo and Sam (to change him back to being a good guy, if you will). Jackson manages the first jump, but fails at the second; the reasons for Faramir's sudden turnaround are left largely unexplained.<br />Given all these points, a basic question arises - why get yourself into the positon where you have to fiddle around so fundamentally with the greatest story ever told? Might it be that Jackson's basic approach to The Two Towers is fundamentally wrong? <br />I simply don't know. I don't think anyone can really know, yet. Presumably, we'll only be able to answer this once the Return Of The King is out (the extended version, that is!).

Dave Grohl's vocals are outstanding and backed up by punk-rock legend Pat Smear its hard to find a bad song on the album. Grohl and Smear combine along with bass player Nate Mendel to produce some of greatest riffs ever played by a rock band. Stand out songs include Monkey Wrench, Hey! Johnny Park, Up in Arms, Walking after you, My Hero and of course the classic Everlong.

B00005JM02|5.0|This a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. Finding Nemo promotes good family values in that a parent will sacrifice anything for their child. This is a great movie of the love between a father and son. <br />Nemo and his father Marlin are clown fish. Nemo is captured by a diver who is also a dentist in Sidney Australia. Nemo and his father live in the coral reefs off of the coast of Australia. Marlin sets out to rescue Nemo with the help of an absent minded blue fish named Dory. The dentist places Nemo in his office aquarium. He plans to give Nemo to his niece Darla. who is not gentle with her pets. When she is seen they play the theme to Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot;. The fish try to help Nemo escape. He eventually does and is re-united with his father. While most computer enhanced movied try to hit you over the head with this new technology, Pixar instead uses it as a means to tell a story. This movie plays on all levels for adults as well as children. <br />The DVD set consists of two discs. Disc one contains the wide screen version. In addition there are several items that go into the production of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The producers wanted the entire staff to by SCUBA certified. They took actual movie footage of the ocean and the coral reef. These movies were the basis for the animated film. The producers wanted the film to be reqalistic and to reflect life in the ocean.<br />The second disc consists of the full screen version. There is also a menu of fun /educational items. The first is a live film about the coral reef produced by Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques Cousteau. There is no real narration, just live footage accompanied by orchestral music. The film keeps on getting interupted by Nemo and his friens.<br />The next item is Mr. Ray's, Nemo's teacher, encyclopedia. This item consists of a live video clip of the actual living counter parts of the creatures in the movie &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;  Each video clip is accompanied by a narrative description about the creature by Mr. Ray.<br />Another item is a story about Nemo that the user can read or have read to them. All three items are good learning tools about the coral reef and the ocean. I teacher can use this as a learning tool about the ocean environment and the coral reef in particular.<br />The second disc also contains an early animated movie done by Pixar called &quot;Knick Knack&quot; as well as clips from future Disney DVD releases. There is also a preview of the next Pixar movie &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. There is also picture sharade game called fisharades that the user can play.<br />In general. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is another winner from Pixar that the entire family can enjoy.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Almost everyone is familiar with George Orwell's novel NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR--either you read it of your own volition, or you had to read it in a high-school or college literature class--so it would be redundant to recount the basic plot here. Two major theatrical versions of the novel have been proffered to the English-speaking public: Michael Anderson's 1984, released in 1956, and Michael Radford's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, released (appropriately) in 1984.  Anderson's 1950s edition is rather dull and lacks the severity of the novel, but Radford's more recent film is about as close as one could possibly get to directly translating Orwell's literary vision to the silver screen.<br />The novel is meant as a warning about how the human spirit, and therefore humanity's future, degrades and deteriorates under strict, ruthless totalitarianism.  Orwell's description of life under a strong-fisted dictatorship is bleak, drab, and colorless, and the novel's protagonist, Winston Smith, and his fellow citizens are described as being barely more than animate skeletons.  Radford creates the visual equivalent by peopling his NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR with reflections of the victims of Nazi concentration camps, and the quality of life in his Oceania is hardly much better.  Even the architecture is severe and cold, the clothes that people wear are rag-like and virtually colorless, and the homes and offices of even government employees like Smith look old and unhealtfully dirty.<br />John Hurt is perfectly cast as Winston Smith.  Not only does he look thin and gaunt, but his superb acting skills allow him to portray Orwell's antihero with an inner despair that the audience can actually feel through his face and physical bearing.  Suzanna Hamilton is also a good choice for Smith's love (or lust?) interest, Julia.  She is attractive enough to make it believable that Hurt's Smith would desire her, yet she is also able to bring to life Orwell's vision of Julia as a hedonistic anti-establishment rebel.  Best of all, though, is the casting of Richard Burton as O'Brien, the Ingsoc Inner Party official who ultimately betrays Smith.  Burton maintains a stoic air throughout the film, remaining calm and mild even as his character tortures Smith, and his O'Brien, as in Orwell's novel, is eerily unsettling.<br />The DVD from MGM offers an anamorphic widescreen digital transfer from a quality print, but it is short on extras (theatrical trailer only).  However, this is such an outstanding film version of a literary great that the lack of extras should not deter film buffs or Orwell fans from adding the DVD to their collections.rebel.

B000084T18|3.0|50 Cent has some good songs on this cd, but it lacked the hip-hop of what I thought it would have. The songs are more of an R&amp;B beat. Not something like DMX. If you are into the more mellow sound of rap, this is a great cd to listen to.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This, in my opinion, is definitely Pearl Jam's BEST album. I know a lot of people were probably expecting another 'Ten' or 'Vs.', but I absolutely love the experimentalness and artiness of this - give their next album after this 'No Code' a listen too if you like experimentalness (although it isn't as hard rocking as Vitalogy). And besides, hearing an album which is exactly like their previous stuff IS boring, it's always good to hear different things. 'Ten' is far too overrated for my liking, although it is an excellent album. It's so easy to tell that Pearl Jam don't give a damn if you like Vitalogy or not, I am with the former.<br />In my opinion it deserves a lot more than 4.3/5 stars. Give it a chance, and listen through the album a few times and I think you'll find it's an absolute masterpiece. All the tracks are great; &quot;Last Exit&quot;, &quot;Not for You&quot;, &quot;Tremor Christ&quot;, &quot;Corduroy&quot;, and &quot;Immortality&quot; notably. &quot;Immortality&quot; being one of the best songs they've ever created. Even other tracks like &quot;Satan's Bed&quot; (which is a very funky song) and &quot;Bugs&quot; which is just plain cool. And their radio hits &quot;Nothingman&quot; and &quot;Betterman&quot;.<br />Pearl Jam's latest album 'Riot Act', is quite similar to Vitalogy. If you love Vitalogy, I think you'll love Riot Act. It even has the same sort of packaging as Vitalogy, very cool. Buy this CD now if you love Pearl Jam or alternative/grunge music AND have an open mind!
B000007OY0|5.0|This is my personal favorite. The movie touched me like no other movie has. A story of courage and hope amidst hopelessness. It is a timeless classic. A must watch.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I would only be truly satisfied if Jackson could film every detail, but we would have a 20 hour film each time with few could stand to sit thru, unless it became a miniseries. The extended version is a delight, Jackson adds the whipped cream and cherries to the already delicious  banana split of a movie.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|The songs from this Britney's album are annoying when mixing with Christina's songs. The lyrics of the Britney's songs are meaningless and immature. I'd say this album is a total waste of my time and really insults my 22-year-old inteligence. With no vocal talents and rotten lyrics, it only does damages to my soul.<br />Don't waste your money buying this CD of trash and more even contributing to someone that doesn't even treat her fans with real efforts of singing Live!

B0000039PW|5.0|Anything but five stars is a desgrace to Biggie's legacy.<br />He's got a crystal clear approach and don't be fooled by the subject matter the guy was smart, strong, and better than anybody else out there. Nobody has even come close to what he has done. Really it's a shame that he was killed. He didn't deserve to die. Reading about what happened and watching the Broomfield documentary is seems B.I.G. was just a way to sell a story that Tupac's death was an East Coast versus West Coast rivalry.<br />Biggie had a way of mixing everything together, making every line new, and always making sense. He was a guy who said something, not that everything had a point, but that everything had a story. You decide what you take from it. Look below:<br />I got 357 ways to simmer sautee I'm the winner all day<br />Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway<br />My forte causes caucausians to say<br />he sounds demented, car weed scented<br />If I said I meant it<br />bite my tongue for noone<br />Now check that out, it's raw, witty, uses conventional and unconventional rhyme schemes and it's funky. When it's on the stereo you wanna dance. And meanwhile you're thinking. This is not everyday hip-hop. This was Michael Jordan in the NBA or Babe Ruth in MLB. This is a one-time phenomenon. I doubt hip-hop will ever have a mayor like Biggie again.<br />If you look at the rhymes of the above lines it puts him on caliber with the great British poets of the early nineteenth century. He has regular end-rhymes, and then adds internal rhymes and resets the rhyme, climaxing with 'bite my tongue for noone' which is a classic inside rhyme finding the like sounds in 'tongue' and 'noone.' And this line is not a real standout. That's why it stands out so much. Every line is this good and some are even better! This ranks BIG with T.S. Eliot or any major poet.<br />Also, his storytelling is incredible. Many white suburban kids are only acquainted with the ghetto through hip-hop. &quot;The streets is a short stop/Either your slingin' crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot.&quot; This gave an image to a multitude of listeners.<br />His mother says he was a poet and I cannot and do not disagree.

B00004RF8J|5.0|There's never been a movie like &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; before, and there probably never will be. The film it resembles the most is undoubtedly &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot; but I find it cleverer, funnier, and more enjoyable than that movie, if still as sick in its own twisted little way.<br />The movie stars Rick Moranis in the role he was born to play: that of a geeky and timid New York City kid named Seymour, who works at a crummy florist shop way downtown along with Audrey (Ellen Greene), a blonde gal who sounds as if she's sucked in too much helium. Seymour is too shy to confess his love for Audrey, and his only way of dropping a hint is when he finds a mysterious plant at another flower shop and names it Audrey II. &quot;I hope you don't mind,&quot; he tells her, and then he drops it by the front window of the store in hopes of drawing customers.<br />It does. The first customer (Christopher Guest) enters with a cheerfully stupid grin and buys $50 worth of roses. &quot;Do you have change for a hundred?&quot; he asks. They don't. &quot;Oh, well, then I guess I'll just have to buy one hundred dollars' worth!&quot; <br />Business starts to boom, and the plant starts to bloom, turning into a ferocious man-eater that demands a sacrifice of human blood from Seymour to crave its hunger. After a few weeks, Seymour is bone dry, unable to slice any more fingers open and feed his gargantuan plant. &quot;Feed me, Seymour!&quot; the talking plant bellows.<br />Audrey has a new boyfriend who has been beating her up. He's a dentist, played by Steve Martin, and as he puts it, &quot;I have a natural talent for causing people pain!&quot; He likes to cause people intense pain, walking through his dentist's office and purposely knocking orderlies in the face with door handles and pulling teeth without applying sedatives. &quot;Wait! I'm not numb!&quot; a customer shouts during an introductory song. &quot;Eh, shut up, open wide, here I come!&quot; hisdentist yells, starting to drill away.<br />Steve Martin has played a dentist since, in the undoubtedly lesser but unjustly bashed &quot;Novocaine&quot; (2001). His outing as a pain-driven dentist in &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; is ten times better, and Martin is truly the highlight of the entire film, from the point when he is introduced riding his motorcycle to the job with a leather jacket (only to strip it off and reveal a white dentist's coat as he enters his office), to the part where Seymour enters his office with a gun in hopes of killing him and feeding him to his plant. Martin doesn't get what's going on, because he's wearing a comedically oversized laughing gas mask he invented that's making him chuckle like a moron. &quot;What are you gonna do? Shoot me? Ha!&quot; The laughing gas kills him before Seymour musters up the emotional strength to.<br />Seymour drags the dentist's dead body home, chops him up and feeds him to Audrey II, but this is only the start of his worries, because soon the media frenzy centered around the wonderfully odd plant starts to drive him to insanity, as he desperately tries to juggle between keeping a clean conscience and keeping away the media.<br />Then Audrey II reveals its true intentions - to take over the world with its offspring - and Seymour decides that it's time to stop Audrey II before it gets too far.<br />&quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; is such a wonderfully offbeat comedy it's almost impossible to dislike. It's one of my favorite comedies, the type of odd little film that doesn't promise to be very much at all but provides a lot. <br />Frank Oz directed the film (based on Roger Corman's classic), and it was filmed on a visibly low budget, but that's okay, because it's supposed to be that way. It's part of the fun. All the stages are obviously just that, with poorly painted backgrounds of New York City and the skyline. You can literally see the cracks in the wall where the different stages meet witheach other. And it's great! It makes the movie, and the movie knows it isn't anything special. At one point, Audrey has a dream sequence of living in a nice little Brady Bunch home, and we see Seymour cutting the lawn with a lawnmower. It's so cheesy and fake that it barely meets the quality standards of a children's television show - but, once again, it helps makes the movie.<br />The movie has tons of cameos, too, including James Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest, Bill Murray, et al. And if the guest stars, dark humor, and delightful direction don't interest you, perhaps the songs will - because many of them are quite good. The highlight is &quot;Suddenly Seymour,&quot; in which Seymour and Audrey have a duet, and Audrey's voice suddenly turns from meek to booming, overpowering Seymour's lyrics and pounding the stage. <br />This is the definition of a cult film. Everything about it just strikes you as a cult film. But whereas &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; is a cult film for - in my opinion - sick people, &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; is a cult film for people who love comedy. It's all in good nature, with cheery little musical numbers every once and a while that are as funny as the songs in &quot;The Blues Brothers,&quot; if not more so. But what makes the film particularly different from the rest is its deliciously dark humor - especially for a mainstream comedy like this. From the plant's adamant bloodlust to the shadowy image of Steve Martin slapping Audrey around behind a backlit stage prop, this is one of the funniest, darkest, and yet also cheerfully lightweight comedies ever.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I'm not going to go deep into the movie all over again. The DVD will most likely be the high-point in our February 2004. Finally fans can re-watch the movie over and over again.<br />From what we read from the press releases and from what we can conclude from  Buena Vista's releace policy, the movie will be a 2 DISC SET, will be presented in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN (2.35:1) and will surely contain a bunch of SPECIAL FEATURES, Tarantino even said he had some SURPRISES ready for the fans.<br />Personally, I can't wait to hold this in my hands.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I can understand the feelings of some Beatles Fans. Yes, old die-hards -- like myself -- have these songs on 33-1/3 LP, 45 rpms, tapes (cassette, 8-track, and 4-track), and on CD. So, when a collection of Beatles tunes is re-packaged and re-rereleased, we sigh. Ah, if only something new would come out of the vaults -- Something to take us beyond &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Anthology.&quot;   <br />This collection, however, is a little different. Never before have Capitol/EMI/Apple released all the Beatles number one hits in a single media. This CD is a musical history of the group, from the start of Beatlemania when &quot;YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. . .&quot; was the rallying cry, to the end of the group amidst controversy and disillusionment (the 60's finally ended). <br />More importantly, this CD gives the &quot;New Generation&quot; a chance to experience the Beatles -- a rather attractive alternative when one considers the garbage that is being passed off as music these days. <br />This collection is put together in chronological order, so the listener has a chance to experience the Beatles from Alpha to Omega -- from the birth of the Mersey Beat, to the &quot;Beatlemania of the movies,&quot; to psychedelic sounds of Sgt Peppers, and, finally, to the &quot;Get Back/Abby Road Sessions.&quot;  The CD is well packaged, and the sound quality is excellent. <br />This CD is worthwhile for the die-hard Beatles fan, as well as for the new fans getting acquainted with the four lads from Liverpool. Indeed, a Splendid Time is Guaranteed For All and, Yes, the Beatles have yet again passed the audition.
B000088E6D|5.0|I first heard Michael Buble' on the television program Dateline. It didn't take long to fall in love with his voice. Even though Michael is singing songs that were previously sung by others, it is refreshing to see a young person coming up through the ranks that sings like a song bird. Again as another said, there hasn't been a new voice since Harry Connick, Jr. I grew up listening to the greats, Crosby, Sinatra, etc.,  because of my parents; sadly those wonderful voices have passed on. I've learned to appreciate good music. Music is something that is suppose to make you feel good inside. I'm sure that Michael Buble' will soon have his own songs to sing and share with the world along with keeping the classics alive.  I refuse to listen to music that makes you nervous and that you can't understand the words to. Someone standing with their guitar and going up and down the neck to create noise is not music to me. Thank you Michael for sharing your beautiful talent with the world. I look forward to listening to your wonderful voice and will enjoy watching your career rise above your expecations. Thank your Grandpa too. :)<BR>A fan for life,<BR>Jacqueline Pieron<BR>Michigan, USA
B00008EYA5|3.0|People are often complaining about Hollywood these days, saying how commercialized and greedy it's become over the years, and how the quality of films such as \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"Casablanca\\" are long forgotten. It's true. The most perdinent proof that Hollywood is running out of original ideas is the fact that film executives are constantly giving the thumbs up to remakes of old 60s and 70s TV shows like \\"The Brady Bunch\\" and \\"Charlie's Angels.\\" Next year we're all going to be sitting through \\"Bewitched\\" with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. The question is: Does \\"Bewitched\\" even need a remake?<br />That's not to say that there aren't original writers out there. Having written a fair share of film screenplays myself, and having read many others, the supply of original scripts is quite high. The demand is not. It's sad when quality films are passed for big-budget extravaganzas with not an ounce of thought and given the green light simply because some overweight pen pusher is considering the zeros.<br />\\"SWAT\\" is a breath of fresh air from the typical TV show remakes. It's not one of the best films in recent memory, but it's not nearly as cliched or goofy as I had imagined before going to see it. In fact, it's surprisingly gritty - more like an R-rated movie than a PG-13.<br />The film stars Colin Farrell as Jim Street. In the beginning, Jim is taking part in a routine hostage situation. At first it's being controlled by the police, but then matters become desperate. \\"Call in the SWAT,\\" a cop says over a radio transmission, and then we see Jim and his five-year partner, Gamble (Jeremy Renner), giving their best efforts.<br />Gamble injures a hostage with a shot he wasn't supposed to take, though, and Jim and Gamble are reprimanded. Gamble is thrown off the force and Jim is reassigned to the lowly life of a SWAT weapons expert. Six months go by, and Sgt. Dan \\"Hondo\\" (Samuel L. Jackson) gives his machine gun to Jim, who does a great job tweaking around with it. And, as if by luck, Dan is assigned to put together a new SWAT team. He chooses Jim, based on his weapon skills; Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), a tough lady; T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles), the wimpy guy; Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), Jim's enemy on the force; and Deke (LL Cool J), a fast runner, as proved in his introductory sequence.<br />After the routine training scenes, the action jumpstarts when a foreign kingpin, Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) comes to town in hopes of making a name for himself. But that doesn't happen - much to the audiences' surprise - because Alex is arrested for a broken tail light and thrown in jail.<br />That's how the trouble starts. Alex offers a high payment to anyone who can break him out of jail - and during a prisoner transport, this happens, headed by Gamble and his cronies. Jim and co. are sent after the ex-SWAT member and his gang, in hopes of taking them down before Alex gets out of the country and so on and so forth.<br />Sounds pretty standard, right? It is. But the film is directed by Clark Johnson in a distinctly grainy style, reminiscent of \\"Training Day,\\" only a bit softer. And the script doesn't resort to cliches all that often - when you think there's going to be a car chase, or a big shoot-out, nothing happens. Which is actually quite a relief, despite the fact that some audiences may have been expecting something a little bit...more.<br />Colin Farrell is doing exactly what he did in \\"The Recruit,\\" acting smart and tough. Michelle Rodriguez is starting to stereotype herself after such flicks as \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" and \\"Resident Evil,\\" playing tough women in both films, but I suppose that's all she really can play.<br />The actor who really surprised is an actor who's been around for quite some time: Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is enjoyable, as usual, as the guy who knows everything - a role that usually fits him. But he steals the show from the other actors with his sly coolness that he displayed in \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"<br />\\"SWAT\\" isn't as goofy as you think it's going to be. It's also not as action-packed as you might expect. If you want another \\"Die Hard\\" rip-off, look elsewhere. \\"SWAT\\" is, surprisingly, a pretty smart and character-driven action movie that never resorts to the typical action film cliches.<br />It's not a great movie, but given the other awful TV show remakes abounding the film market, you could certainly do worse than \\"SWAT.\\"
B00005JM02|1.0|Huge grossing movies are usually far from the best nowadays but I kept hearing no this really is great. This movie is the pinnacle of average Saturday morning cartoon/Full House humor aka non-entertaining humor. The plot doesn't matter cause you know what's gonna happen. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Disney/Pixar hater; I just caught a little Toy Story on Disney and I could still enjoy it even though I had watched it many many times. The only jokes that made me giggle were the times the blue fish called Nemo Fabio and 1 more that most people won't get.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I really enjoyed the first Matrix movie, but this one was disappointing. There were plenty of action scenes, but they seemed very repetitive, except for the freeway chase, which was good, as well as the motorcycle chase downtown. It would have helped, too, if the audience had been given just a little bit of review with some plot device that wasn't too cumbersome. It took a little too long to get back into the world of the matrix. The direction was only adequate, the script less than adequate, and the acting very inconsistent. I hope the next Matrix movie is a step up from this one.

B00000HYXB|5.0|For a year or two now I have been a big fan of Iced Earth, and of course 97% of all Iced Earth fans also love Blind Guardian... i never really heard them that much other than 1 or 2 songs, so this year around September or so I figured &quot;I gotta get into em SOMEtime!&quot; so i just radomly picked this one up.. WOW, this cd makes me wish I lived in Germany!! Very nice melodic speed metal with a lot of classical influence. I also really the like the story of this album, it's some type of 'Lord of the Rings'-ish story, i'd think it would be that because 'Middle Earth' is where Lord of the Rings takes place. <br />My favorite songs on here are &quot;Into the Storm&quot;, &quot;The Dark Elf&quot;, and &quot;Time Stands Still At The Iron Hill&quot;<br />EXCELLENT find! why can't America have music this great?? (well with the exception of Iced Earth of course!!)
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|This is one of the best sequels I've ever seen.  I think this movie beats the first one.  The storyline is basically a man named Stryker many years ago discovered his son was a mutant, he sent him to the Professor to get help.  His son was sent back to him basically being told there was nothing they could do to help him and that being a mutant was not a disease.  The son being angry had his parents toyed with them and showed them visions that weren't real...finally one day Stryker's Wife put a power drill to her temple to try and drill out the visions.  Stryker bent on revenge wanted to kill all mutants by using the power of Cerebro.  The whole movie is excellent...Wolverine finds more about who he is...Storm's role is larger and more significant...and who can argue with seeing more of Halle.;)  Mystique although not in a large amount of the movie has some big moments...Rogue, Pyro, Jean Grey also have pivotal roles as well as of course the Professor and Magneto.  The movie has no real letdowns...there is a new addition with the Nightcrawler who is part of many of the crucial scenes to the film.  If you don't have a problem with sitting down for 2 1/2 hours then you will love this movie.  Plenty of action with a great story behind it...you won't find that in too many movies out there now.  Best movie of 2003 in my opinion.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Ok the only songs worthy of buying (so far I've only listened to 1-6)are Me against the music, toxic, and Showdown. Maybe it is worth $14.00 or $15.00? Is it???
B00006LSM3|4.0|Except for the title number, this is a masterpiece. Harrison was always the most experimental of the Beatles, and this disc runs the gamut from redone 40s standards to wondrous treatments of his own work. His mastery of many string instruments is highlighted by the fact that most of the tracks on each number are done by George himself. His son has done a wonderful job of editing. If they had just left &quot;Brainwashed&quot; off, it would have been perfect.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Great film.  It shows the world of bodybuilding before it became the steroid-fueled, freak-show it is today.  <br />Despite the fact that the bodybuilders used steroids back then (which were legal and Arnold admits to in the special features), they had not gone down the road of no return that has created the bloated 5'2&quot;, 300 pounders we have today that look like crap.<br />Buy this DVD for the great training sequences, the mind-games of Arnold, and the underground training of Lou Ferrigno.<br />The special features (including a Cinemax documentary on the making of the film, an interview with Arnold, and a retrospective on the participants) are fantastic, as well.<br />All in all, a great DVD.  Especially at the low list price.
6305128952|4.0|I've always been a big Redford fan.  But let's face it, he can be a little stiff.  In this movie, he moves the movie along with the smallest effort.  A look here, a small sentence there.  And all the while, he's seeing right through the mother.<br />This is a great movie if you have interest in children or animals and righting a wrong.  Redford takes a mentally and physically damaged horse and is asked to magically cure it.  But it's really the humans that need the help and Redford eventually works his magic on the daughter.<br />I read the book first and it is very touching.  The written description of the accident is chilling and Redford does a great job of recreating that scene in this movie.  Watch this movie as it will eventually be known as a Redford classic of his real loves of the West and nature.
0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway is an intriguing and well-written story.  I enjoyed reading this book mostly because of the captivating plot.  I felt that Jake Barnes was an unusual character and the fact that he never got what he wanted added more interest to the plot.  However, Lady Brett Ashley angered me due to her selfishness and destructive behavior towards all of the men in this book.  Although it fit in with the plot, her character aggravated me.  I felt bad for Jake and how Brett treated him, but I also think that the tension between the two of them added a lot of interest to the story.  \\"Oh, Jake,\\" Brett said, \\"we could have had such a damned good time together.\\" (251)  Aside from the intense drama occurring during the story with Brett and her lovers, I really enjoyed reading about the crazy nights that this group of friends would have.  They were always out at bars and cafes, and when they went to Spain for the bullfighting there was a non-stop festival.  <BR> I feel that the most significant theme in this novel was the characters' feelings of having meaningless lives.  Jake feels as though his life has no more meaning after his injury during the war.  But he's not the only one who feels this sense of worthlessness.  This group of friends drowned their troubled minds with drinking and dancing, and that was how they coped with their aimless lives every day.  This theme does not relate to my life at all, but I'm sure it relates to the lives of many other people.  Some people turn to drinking or drugs or anything they can to escape their feelings of misery or emptiness.  <BR> While reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  I think it's an extraordinary story and I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone.  The plot is intense and dramatic, with unexpected twists and bizarre characters.  I recommend this book for those interested in reading about the fictional lives of a group of aimless souls looking for trivial ways to escape their feelings.
B00006RU5B|2.0|After listening to Audioslave, I am confident in saying RATM is better, much, much better. RATM's singer has a much better voice, and I like the way the guitarist (same in both AS and RATM) plays better in RATM.<br />Conclusion: Get any of RATM's CDs instead of this. End of story.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I know the point of this movie was to 'educate' the public about early US history. But to justify millions of dollars of effort, the millions have to not just recreate a time, but also express something really touching within it. Actually, the latter is much more important.<br />Scorsese didn't find anything touching. And I really think he was looking in the wrong place -- a very 'hollywood' place -- finding or forging big characters and contriving a big story.<br />I have a hope, that long after we're all dead, the majority of the population will see the first 100 years of movie-making as very clumsy and misguided.
B000002NE4|5.0|Born again? Not quite, too much intelligence and irony in Cave's possible best songwriting. Evenly brilliant record, doesn't wear with time. My favorites here \\"Brompton Oratory\\" and \\"People just ain't no good\\".<br />Like every true artist, Cave has grown and changed with years. It's great fun to compare to what he has achived from those glory, glory days of the Birthday Party.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I LOVE club music...and I love people who aren't afraid to make music that gets them going. This poor girl has endured some major media jibberish and at times probably feels completely alone. But she took a couple of years to make some really personal tracks. This album is great...with lots unique sounds and &quot;musicianship&quot; going on in the background of the songs. I'm picky...but this album gets better everytime I listen. All I can say is, 'good luck, Britney'...I hope people give you a chance.
B000001GPX|5.0|I know when I hear something truly outstanding. Months and months ago I was severely puzzled by all these reviews here; the one said it was stupendous, but others thought it lacked this or that.<br />Now that was all very difficult for a, more or less, beginner. Reference works named it a classic, all right, so ... the price was excellent, too ... I bought it. You'd be amazed how awful all those 5ths sound on television and commercials and at other places. This is nothing of the sort, of course. Kleiber (who did not churn out recording after recording like, say, Karajan) hit the gold here.<br />This CD towers above most other competitors in the field, and later, when you have listened to it many many times, you begin accumulating those other 5ths. To tell the truth, you might search a while before you find something you also cherish. To all people relatively new to classical music, buy this one. Indeed, later you will be tempted to search for others, as I said before. In Classical Music few recordings of a particular work are definitive or possess all the qualities you demand to hear all at once.<br />You won't go wrong here. Besides the famous 5th you get the 7th, equally fine (second movement is a jewel).
B000002BFL|5.0|For those that entered the vast body of Springsteen's work through Born in the USA or Born to Run, this is going to be a shock to the system. Where on his most popular albums Boss engaged in fast cars and girls and other images of glory, on this (and the album it is sequel to, Nebraska) he strips it down to accoustic instruments and analyzes the darker side of America. These are stories of desparation, of crossing the border not into New York City (as on Born to Run) but into the promised land of the U.S from Mexico and finding only dead end jobs and tragedy and loneliness. The best part though is that Bruce's rough, ragged voice mirrors that loneliness and desparation, just barely raising it above a whisper. In all these stories, Bruce tells stories of people that anyone can relate to, because though their conditions are extreme, we all face the emotions these characters face. And clearly Bruce has faced them too, as he confronts each song with the right amount of articulate acting out.<BR>The bottom line is this album is for all those adventerous Bruce Springsteen fans out there who loved Nebraska. It's also for everyone who loves accoustic music and the brave songwriters like Bob Dylan and Neil Young and Phil Ochs and all those others who took political chances in their music and sang without fierce screaming, but with soft, lonely, vocal tones. Its an essential and it will make you feel like your in the rough, lonely, world of a middle of nowhere working class town like Youngstown.
0140186409|5.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was the one great novel Steinbeck was born to write. Of the authors 17 books I dear say this must be the best one. The novel won Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and it was \\"a cornerstone\\" of his 1962 Nobel Prize award.<br />From the first page I fell in love with Steinbeck's way of writing, his humble and delicate language. Published in 1939, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the 250 000 American migrants who pulled up, and headed west on Route 66 - to California.<br />Through the book we follow one of the families that headed west, The Joad family. We enter the story as Tom Joad, one of the children in the family, gets out of jail. He comes home, finding his family suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Tormented and forced to leave their land, the Joad's strap as many of their belongings as they can to their truck. With the truck piled high they hit the road for their journey to promise land - to California.<br />The Joad's believe that leaving Oklahoma for California is the answer to all their troubles. California will be abundant with opportunities - work for everyone, plenty of food, oranges and peaches on every tree. Pa even has a leaflet saying they need thousands of men on the farms. Reality will soon catch up with them. The journey to California turns out to be everything but easy. They experience all sorts of hardship; loss of family members, trouble with the truck, harassment by the police and locals. When the Joad's finally make it to California, their troubles and suffering are rewarded not by work, plenty of food, and oranges on every tree, but with even more troubles. While moving around, following the different picking seasons chasing for work, the family is enduring such poor living conditions. They are living in squatter camps, government camps, and in the end shacks in labour camps.<br />The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are all very well developed.  They are so vivid and one cannot help but to care deeply for them all. Several of the characters have left a lasting impression; Tom Joad, Grandpa, the courageous ex-preacher, and above all Ma Joad. She is a loveable, courageous, strong woman and I admire her spirit, dignity and her determination as she struggles to keep her family together. Even facing so much testing and hardship, she still keeps perspective and hope.<br />An experiment that works well in this novel is the \\"in-between\\" chapters. Short stories with reflections and background about the Great Depression; how a used-car dealer take advantage of his desperate customers or how farmers sprayed oranges with kerosene and threw potatoes in the river to keep market prices up while hundreds of thousands of people was starving, as well as other small stories, true literary treasures such as the first \\"in-between\\" chapter about the turtle.<br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is written in a most memorable way. The book is no less than a landmark in American history and it is one of the absolute greatest and most significant novels of the last century.

B000089QEN|5.0|I read William Makepeace Thackeray's novel &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; the only novel of his I have read, back in February of this year. I was hesitant to do so at first because I heard many negative comments about the book from several people whose opinions I respect. I am happy to report that the book is a splendid novel, full of vibrant characters that soon come to feel like living, breathing creatures under Thackeray's masterful pen. The book was so spectacular that when I learned an American film version starring Reese Witherspoon is set to arrive sometime next year I looked forward to seeing it. Fortunately, an individual with fantastic knowledge about foreign films quickly alerted me to the existence of this BBC adaptation of Thackeray's masterpiece. Released over here in the U.S. by A&amp;E, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; runs for nearly six magical hours. The first time I watched this production, back in the summer, it took me only one day to view because I simply couldn't turn it off. I recently watched &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; again and realized I really ought to put this on my Christmas list because it is that good. I would start watching American television again if I could see productions of this caliber on a regular basis.<br />&quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; set in the years surrounding Napoleon's resurgence in Europe, traces the rise and fall of two young British women, Rebecca Sharp and Amelia Sedley. The two young ladies meet in a sort of finishing school and when the time to reenter society arrives, Amelia takes Rebecca home with her to meet the family. The Sedley clan is comfortably upper middle class, with the father earning a nice living speculating on government bonds. Also home in time to greet the two is Amelia's buffoonish brother Jos, recently returned from his minor government post in India. Becky, an orphan who is essentially a gold digger of epic proportions, attempts to attach herself to the portly and arrogant Jos with hilarious results. Amelia looks forward to reacquainting herself with George Osborne, the son of one of her father's business partners and a first class cad. Nearby is William Dobbin, George's best friend and a decent man who has a huge crush on the clueless Amelia. Jos soon ruins any chance he has with Becky when he gets drunk on a group outing. From this point forward, a vast array of hilarious yet contemptible characters prance across Thackeray's stage.<br />As Dobbin and Osborn head off to continental Europe to fight against Napoleon, Becky obtains a job as a governess for a deteriorating noble family called the Crawleys. Sharp's job soon finds her embroiled in the tumultuous politics of this clan as all of the family members vie with each other in an attempt to curry favor from the rich but ailing Miss Crawley. It isn't too long before Becky receives a marriage proposal from the patriarch of the family at about the same time she runs off with the man's son. As Sharp navigates through the convoluted realms of the rich and powerful in an effort to secure for herself a better social position, Amelia encounters her own problems. The family loses its money with Napoleon's defeat and must find a way to survive. The quick marriage between Amelia and George ends just as rapidly when Osborne dies on the battlefield, leaving behind a pregnant Amelia and an infuriated elder Osborne who wants nothing to do with his son's widow. Caught in the middle is Dobbin, who desperately wishes to make Amelia his own but cannot bring himself to compete with the memory of dearly departed George. The fun of reading and watching &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is in seeing how all of these disparate threads come together in the end.<br />The BBC production of Thackeray's work does a wonderful job of adapting his novel to television. Only a few scenes in the book fail to make an appearance here, something I consider as a sign of a successful production. Where &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; the television movie succeeds most is in the cast chosen to portray the diverse characters. I happened to read a version of the book that included the original drawings that accompanied Thackeray's story, and I must say that it is obvious the producers of this movie studied these sketches in detail. One need only look at the resemblance actor Gerard Murphy's Lord Steyne has to the pictures in the novel to recognize how closely the producers followed Thackeray's vision. The whole cast does a marvelous job of mirroring the characters in &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; but Natasha Little as Rebecca Sharp deserves special mention. Her performance is tremendous, and the transformation she undergoes from a slightly pretty schoolgirl to a stunning beauty with social rank is amazing. Moreover, Little captures perfectly Becky's barely contained scorn for those around her. With a roll of the eyes, a slight shrug of the shoulders, and a mischievous grin she devastatingly disparages all of the nonsense going on around her. You simply cannot help but like her. As bad as Becky Sharp is as a person, Thackeray throws you a curve ball at the end that upends everything we think we know about her.<br />I liked the DVD presentation, although there aren't any extras to speak of on the discs. One thing that did surprise me about this production was the booming background music that fires up from time to time. It's a type of spicy music replete with blatting horns, and the first time it came on it nearly blew my speaker system out. I ended up enjoying the music, though, as it seemed to add an element of whimsy to many scenes that are, frankly, whimsical. I simply don't have anything bad to say about this movie.

0783114893|4.0|Especially when you're just a boy driving along empty highways. C. Thomas Howell nevertheless decides to give Rutger Hauer a ride, thinking the man might keep him awake (it's a rainy night, and he has to go all the way to California to deliver his drive-away-car).<br />(Un)fortunately the stranger does just that--keeping him wide awake. The hitchhiker plays some game which involves butchering his victims ... not a long while ago he cut off the arms and legs of another man who thought it okay to trust a stranger.<br />So now Howell is in some trouble. By this time (fairly early in the film) The Hitcher is well on its way to become a spell-binding horror/thriller, and I think you will watch it in one sitting, demanding to know what the hitchhiker's motives are and what'll happen next.<br />I think the ending might be a let-down for those who misunderstood 'the idea behind'/'motive of' The Hitcher. Because a number of other reviewers have done all they can to reveal it, I suggest you watch the film yourself before reading those reviews. It's my opinion that The Hitcher might lose some strength if you know too much beforehand (a bit of speculation on your behalf might be more entertaining).<br />Bottom line: Terrific cast and a fine director.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie is so awesome.  I was totally surprised by it at the theater.  It is not often that a sequel is actually better than the first movie, but this one definitely breaks the mold.  Casting Ian McKellan as Magneto was pure genius!  The scenes with Magneto are the best in the whole movie (in my opinion), especially the scene where Magneto breaks out of his plastic prison.  &quot;...too much iron in your blood&quot;...INDEED!!!!  :)  <br />Other than the brilliance of McKellan, the story this time around is so much better.  It was a good idea to show just how alienated and isolated the mutants are from the humans.  It gives the viewer a good idea just how many dimensions these characters are fighting on....they are fighting amongst each other's philosophies...and against their human counterparts.  The action in this movie is non-stop from start to finish....there is not a minute where you may become bored.  Yet, the sequencing is spread out just right not to lose your interest in the film either.  The story easily follows the action...and that is a good thing!<br />If you have not watched a great SciFi/book-based movie this year....besides Lord of the Rings....you MUST see this film!  It is so great...you will rush out and get a copy for yourself (if you don't have one already)!!  I can't wait for the next one....and more Magneto!!!!!!
0440180295|4.0|Wow!  Is this guy like Tarantino's father or what?  They are like the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of time. It was entertaining, but the majority of the time, I could not place the scenes in the correct order.  It truly was like seeing Pulp Fiction for the first time.  It was so bizarre that you end up watching it again.  Only to find yourself questioning why you watched it the first time.   <BR>If Mr. Vonnegut wanted to hold my attention, he should have started the story on Tralfamadore.  The beginning was so rough that my eyes had to be tied open with fishing line.  The author paints a very gray picture of his own life only to dramatically spice up Billy's.  When I first started to read it, I thought to myself, \\"This guy is ripping off every movie I have ever seen about time travel.\\"  Then I realized that this book was written a little bit before my time.  Maybe all of those writers were fans, or maybe Vonnegut traveled through time and became a fan of theirs.  After reading this book, I also began to question my own sanity.   <BR>Billy Pilgrim, what a name. Billy, your, \\"average Joe,\\" embarking on a pilgrimage through the years of his life in what ever order he chooses. And Montana? Come on, only two things could be  as big as the state of Montana on a porn star and neither of those two are ever her imagination.  Mr. Vonnegut's, on the other hand is truly unbelievable.  I am sure that in a caf in heaven, gentlemen like Rod Sterling and Leonard Nimoy are holding their breath and waiting to share a cup of holy coffee with him. <BR>I suppose the best way to describe this book without offending any war veterans or stepping on the toes of any Klingons. Is to say if M*A*S*H and Star Trek could somehow have a baby, it would be Slaughterhouse-five.
B000002KO3|5.0|This release is by far the best thing released by the Talking Heads!  Every track is infectious in its own way and will stay with you for a long time.  A timeless work, and a band at its best! This is an album I'd want with me on that deserted island....

B00003CXZ1|3.0|The first thought that I had in watching this movie was: this must be the attempt at a feminine edition of Indiana Jones.  Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie just isn't very convincing.  Granted, the story was pretty good.  The idea of the Illuminati wanting to take over the world through the Triangle of Life seems good enough.    However, what really did this movie in was the special effects, or lack thereof.  Everything felt sooo....&quot;video-gamish&quot;.  It was so predictable.  Croft would find objects so easily, and then from out of nowhere, would be monsters that she would have to fight and annihilate....and she would....then move on to the next adventure.  It just seemed that the flow of the movie was so predictable....it really hurt the story's credibility.  Don't get me wrong, if you are in the mood for a good romp...then by all means watch this movie.  Just don't expect an intellectual thriller.  Indiana Jones is a much better series for that kind of thing.  Just sit back and ENJOY this one!

B0000CFW87|1.0|This guy has a great voice, but the problem is he hasn't got any songs to sing. His first album had just a few English songs and the trend continues on this cd as well. I find myself skipping all of the foreign language songs and only listening ot the English ones. No offence, but I don't like to listen to words I can't translate! There are only 5 English songs on the album! Why can't he sing an entire album in English and then release the French version separately? I'm taking the English songs from the debut album and adding the English songs from this album to make one album that I don't have to skip through! My finger is tired!

B00009TB5G|5.0|The OTHER greatest film I've ever seen<br />About a year ago, I watched the Extended DVD Edition of Fellowship of the Ring, and declared <BR>this &quot;the best film I'd ever seen&quot;. I was highly anticipating the second film in the trilogy, The Two Towers, as this was my favourite book in the original trilogy, and I had faith that Peter Jackson and co. could faithfully adapt this wonderful book to the silver screen. In the end, I do have some criticisms of the final result, but the Extended DVD Edition has put to rest many of my initial reservations. And these changes in no way affected my sheer joy and love of this film, and the series as a whole.<br />From the subdued music that opens the film, it's obvious that the second film will be much darker and grimmer than the first. This is wholly appropriate, as both Sauron and Saruman are now gathering their forces for an assault upon Middle Earth. The enroaching darkness is one glaring point that I missed while reading the original novel, so kudos to Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh for picking this up.<br />I honestly didn't think that the opening sequence of the first film could be topped - but it has. The battle between Gandalf and the Balrog is nothing short of stupendous - it's a vicious and nasty combat engagement between two mortal enemies, but at the same time it has a fantastical element that takes your breath away.<br />On my initial viewing of the film, the parts that I enjoyed least were Frodo and Sam's journey. This is tied up with my own experiences from the book - I always skipped over Frodo and Sam's experiences in the Two Towers, as I found them rather boring. This was obviously a huge mistake. Frodo's conflict is an internal and psychological one - the ring is attempting to possess his soul, and the introduction of Gollum is a constant reminder of what may happen to him should he falter in his quest.<br />And as for Gollum? The character of Gollum is one of the greatest triumphs in the area of special effects. He is a living breathing character, not an artful arrangement of pixels on a computer screen. Credit for much of that goes to Andy Serkis and the team at WETA Digital. Until viewing the extras, I had no appreciation of the sheer level of craftmanship that went into the creation of Gollum. The Academy Award for Special Effects was richly deserved.<br />The battle with the Warg Riders was an inspired addition to the film. It's something that could've happened between the journey to Edoras and Helm's Deep. However, like some others, I do have misgivings about Aragorn's &quot;faked death&quot;. Anyone who has read &quot;Return of the King&quot; knows that Aragorn will obviously survive. <br />As for scenes with Aragorn and Arwen, I think Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are grossly underestimating the audience's intelligence. We all remember who Arwen is, and what stake she has in the story. So nobody is going to mind if she doesn't appear in the second film.<br />Helms Deep  is an epic battle done right. Peter Jackson inserts scenes to remind the audience just exactly who Aragorn and Theoden's Army are defending. An example is of the mother urging her children to flee the beseiged village. It totally ripped my heart out when I saw it for the first time. <br />It was pleasing to note that the Extended DVD had more scenes fleshing out the character of Treebeard. The scene with Treebeard's &quot;poetry&quot; was a nice touch. As a reader who was almost bored to tears with some of Tolkien's poems, I can well emphathise with this reaction. And I absolutely loved the scene with the Ent Draught. <br />One of the biggest misgivings I had with the second film, was the change to the character of Faramir. After viewing the Extended DVD, I know understand why those changes were made. When Faramir escorts them to an escape exit from the beseiged city of Osgiliath, we finally see the noble character of Faramir from the books. <br />My favourite DVD extras are the &quot;Cameras in Middle Earth&quot; and the Directors commentary, It's very clear that the comraderie between the actors didn't end with the first film. Bernard Hill is a perfect addition to the cast (&quot;Look! Jamboree Sides!&quot;), and is obviously a perfect foil for the mischevious Viggo Mortensen. And Dominic Monaghan's disclosure of Viggo Mortensen's indiscretions with a bearded lady of Rohan were absolutely priceless. And yes Dominic, I expect that Viggo will kick your a** after watching the DVD!<br />I enjoyed the cast commentary on the first film, but the cast commentary on the second film was curiously subdued. I suspect this was because the four hobbits (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) were sheperded into separate rooms. <br />The director's commentary on the other hand, was extremely enjoyable this time around. Some favourite moments? Peter Jackson comparing the peasants at Edoras to those from the Monty Python films (&quot;Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead!&quot;). A potential scene where Gandalf turns up at Lothlorien stark naked, after his resurrection (&quot;It wouldn't be Lord of the Rings, it'd be Ring of the Lord&quot; quips Fran Walsh). Peter Jackson going on about a super expanded edition of the DVD in fifty years time (&quot;Oh pleeeaaasseee stop!!!&quot; wails Philippa Boyens). And finally, Peter Jackson musing on a spin-off detective series for Treebeard (&quot;He does solve mysteries. It's just that it takes him a looooonnng time to get there&quot;). Absolutely priceless.<br />In summary, I strongly recommend that you buy the Expanded Edition, regardless of whether you are a fan of Tolkien or not. I remember showing the first film's Expanded DVD Edition to my parents, and they were very impressed with what they saw. And they aren't the world's biggest LOTR fans. So go ahead, spend your hard earned cash. I guarantee you won't regret it.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is a beautiful CD, Karma Police and Just are wonderful songs (if you can find the Just video, it's worth watching). The real highlight of this CD is the final song, Street Spirit, the most hauntingly depressing song ever written. The first 4 minutes of the song speak of that hopeless feeling many people feel, but then out of this depression comes words of hope &quot;Immerse your soul in love&quot;. Truly a brilliant song (and CD) from modern legends.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have read a lot of bad reviews about this CD so it took a while before i purchased it.  Having completed Madonna's albums since 1983, i believe that Madonna's career had its ups and downs.  From dance pop to electronica to rap, \\"American Life\\" is actually better than the most recent 2000's \\"Music.\\"  Out of the eleven tracks, i can say that the most powerful ballad in the album would be \\"X-Static Process,\\" while \\"Easy Ride\\" is truly outstandingly original - combining beats and symphonies and effects.  Coincidence or not, it was the perfect song to close the entire album.  Strengths of the album include the title track, Nothing Fails, Nobody Knows Me (very nice!), Intervention (great!), Die Another Day, Love Profusion (my favorite!), and Hollywood (nice remixes available).  Honorable mentions should go to I'm so Stupid and Mother and Father.<br /><br />Comparing Music and American Life, i can fairly say that the latter has more original materials compared to some of her self-parody (Amazing/Beautiful Stranger) (Paradise/Frozen), except Nothing Fails having some common denominators with Like a Prayer (chorus) and Die Another Day having some semblance with her monster hit \\"Music.\\"  The sophomore outing of Madonna and Mirwais showed great improvement from Music and the fans can hear. If \\"Music\\" was a test run, then \\"American Life\\" is the better fruit of their fusion. Comparing the title tracks, \\"Music\\" is undoubtedly a great track, while \\"American Life\\" became the experiment.  No doubt there were mixed reactions when the song was released.<br /><br />However, please take note that this album is one of her lyrically rich work in years. Too bad the album doesn't have a lyric sheet for the fans to easily sing with her.  Nonetheless, after listening for only a few times, i can sing some of my favorite songs in this album.<br /><br />i disagree what others said that it is not listenable.  It is actually one of her best works since the 90's.  it is a stand to current issues, and Madonna made sure her message comes across using digital beats and harmony.<br /><br />to date, madonna has almost 50 single remixes, excluding the unauthorized, unreleased remixes.<br /><br />waiting for the next album is just half the fun...er message comes across using digital beats and harmony.    to date, madonna has almost 50 single remixes, excluding the unauthorized, unreleased remixes.    waiting for the next album is just half the fun...
B0000DJZA5|4.0|While the album is nothing overly spectacular, I must say it is enormously better and more enjoyable than the original Phil-Spector-ed version. It is a nice, solid work. The sound is raw, warm and very honest. Not a bad effort by a nice little band.<br />The album properly captured a very important piece of rock and roll history. Even on their off days, The Beatles could still produce magic.
B00005JLSE|1.0|There are enough reviews of this movie so that little pro or con is left to be said, but I will ask anyone who sees the movie, to afterwards identify the lyrics of any of the songs.  This is my test of whether the musical is of real value.  All anyone that I know can give me is the chorus of the initial song-All That Jazz- but not the whole lyrics.  Frankly, I couldn't understand from that song what was being sung and the editing made it obvious that the lyrics were not of importance.  <br />Now think of other musicals that you have seen, The Music Man, My Fair Lady, J.C. Superstar, West Side Story, etc., and think of how many songs that you can remember.  I am willing to bet that there is a vast difference in any of those stage/movie events and Chicago.<br />I saw this movie on DVD during the holidays, and perhaps the theater experience is different.  But, I found nothing about any of the characters that made them appealing, and believe me, I was looking forward to seeing Catherine Zeta Jones.  After a half hour, I fought with others to make all of the trips to the kitchen for snacks, the newspaper and No Doze.
038572179X|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. I was unable to put it down as events unfolded. This is not an easy read and if you want quick &quot;entertainment&quot; this is not for you. The ending was heart breaking as we discover the outcome of 2 of the main characters-tears came to my eyes in the last 2 pages. I found Briony to border on the sociopathic and I don't feel as if she ever atoned for her terrible sin. The idea of making this a novel within a novel was very well done and I feel this McEwan novel should have won the Booker instead of &quot;Amsterdam&quot;.  This is a book that needs to be reread.

B00007GZR5|5.0|While a world without tragedy may be desirable for us mortals, it is unfortunately not in our fate. Sometimes everyday people with normal lives are thrust into calamity. And sometimes that calamity is so devastating, our faith and happiness are quickly smeared into mud. If anyone can imagine their child dying in a gory accident, they still cannot imagine the internal agony that would follow. Now double that tragedy. Triple that tragedy, and you have the basis for a heart-gripping and believable tale. The character, Annie, understandably, cannot easily recover from her loss and withdraws psychologically. Her pain envelops her, and she commits suicide. As an artist, she was more prone to an emotional perception of her environment. While in good times her painting expressed her joy, it also controls the strokes of her brushes in bad times.  <br />The movie follows this dark course, but delivers a twist. It offers hope. While delivering the audience through a powerful action-filled experience into the afterlife, it is laced with an encryption of spiritual enlightenment. Tuning into Annie's mind, the liquid texture of an artist's palette becomes an underpainting to the visual renderings of the film. Chris's journey to rescue his soulmate Annie is a moving decline through graphic levels of hell that rival the images of the painter Bosch. As he struggles through fallen souls and wrecked landscapes, his appreciation of the gift of inner life becomes more apparent. He is finding himself, as he is searching for Annie.<br />Although most traditional religious thought is unclear in their written doctrines on suicide, leaving the outcome of suicide victims open to mortal pessimists, this story offers a brighter take. In this new view, the audience is able to transcend the judgements of theorists, and discover an afterlife that is as mutable as oil colors on a plate of glass. A beautiful rendition. Only in discovering who we are, and why we are where we are, are we finally able to attain the heavenlike destiny that God has set aside for us. <br />Perhaps in the real afterlife we are not saturated with doctrination and separated by denomination. Hopefully we humans are finally able to set aside our prejudices of religious zealism and ignorance that so seperates us here. Wishfully, we will discover a world that is how God intented, a world like we can imagine in this visual movie.  Without revealing too much of the ending, believe that this story will lift you in the end, and give you dreams as vivid as rainbows. Enjoy.
B000002GB2|5.0|If I were stranded on a desert island, and were given an allowance of just 4 Styx CDs, Equinox would be one of them. Should be played like a book, from start to finish. I consider J.Y.'s &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; to be his jammin'est, and while I'm on the subject of J.Y., let me just say that, while his contributions on paper seem few and far between, quality beats out quantity any day, and all his songs ROCK!!!<br />I give it 5 stars because there's no weak track.<br />4 stars means it has just a little too much Dennis. (Just so you know my rule of thumb.) My experience has shown me that Stygians are largely split up into 2 camps: One being the &quot;purists&quot;- DeYoung freaks who lapped up his endless balladeering and wouldn't catch a live show without him and, two being those of us who insist on ROCKIN' and have a medium-to-low threshold for the crooner keyboardist, and believe Dennis basically Roger Water-ed himself out of the group. <br />Equinox is a glimpse into the past, a Styx era free from the obvious DeYoung hostile taken-over latter days.
B00009TB5G|5.0|As with the Fellowship, the extended version of Two Towers is actually better, more coherent, a bit closer to Tolkien and more fully realized in its vision than the version seen in theaters a year ago. My only complaint, the anachronistic use of the term \\"nervous system\\" when the word \\"head\\" would have sufficed (you'll know to what I refer when you see it in the added footage). Otherwise, the added footage better develops the characters and the story as I'm sure J.R.R.T. would have preferred. The two Appendices DVDs showing how every aspect of the film was made are wonderful, informative and entertaining in their own right. The documentary on how Gollum came to the screen is especially interesting. There are also explanations by the writers on how and why they altered part's of Tolkien's novel for the film, and while I didn't agree with the reasons for all of the changes (and you may not either) it was interesting and some consolation to get these concise explanations directly from the screenwriters.<br />If you did not like the changes to the story when you saw this film in the theater last year then you won't like this extended version any better, but if you enjoyed it then you'll likely find this version even more engrossing and enjoyable on repeated viewings. If you buy the Gift Set you'll get the extended version DVD set plus you'll also get a beautiful Gollum collectible resin figure and another DVD about it and other collectibles. If you just can't get enough Lord of the Rings then go for it. Frodo lives!

B00004VXF2|4.0|I find it incredible that, in the year 2003, people still don't understand that some art cannot be appreciated passively. If there is one overarching trend in the history of 20th century art, it is a movement from an art of passive, one-way communication, toward an art that requires the audience to take part in the synthesis of meaning, and asks us to learn about ourselves.<br />Some art hands its meaning to you on a silver platter, predigested. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I've got books and CDs full of this kind of art.<br />But there are certain artworks which will give you nothing if you don't actively engage them. These artworks throw the question of meaning back into the audience's lap. If you find no meaning in them, it doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on the artwork - it might reflect poorly on your own lack of imagination and intellect. Or maybe you're just not trying.<br />Sorry to sound like a snob here, but come on, people. This album's detractors admit that they don't understand what it's all about; why, then, do they feel qualified to pass judgement on it? Do they also feel qualified to be wine critics and financial advisors?<br />Believe it or not, just because you don't understand or appreciate something, doesn't mean that people who *do* are being pretentious. In fact, slinging around accusations like that just makes you sound like the sort of redneck who thinks it's &quot;fancified&quot; to drink imported beer instead of Coors Light. If you don't get it, fine, but don't be a jerk about it.<br />Better yet, find a good history of modern art. Study it well. Understand that art since 1900 has evolved myriad new modes of creation, perception, and cognition, and that you may not have learned about all of these through pop culture. If you still don't like it, more power to you, but at least then you'll know what you're talking about.
B000099T2L|4.0|I was supprised by how many negative comments I read about this album. I can admit it took me a little while to get into it, but when I gave it a try I fell in love with it. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; &amp; &quot;Baby Boy&quot; are good singles, but the real music is waiting to be heard like in &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;Speechless&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Be With You&quot;, &quot;Daddy&quot;, &amp; my personal favorite &quot;Dangerously in Love 2&quot;. Listen to the words and really hear the music and you'll get a real taste of Beyonce's style, not just her pretty face.
B000060P79|5.0|simple plan did a good job but a few songs on the album is kinda...i dunno...boring, and the lyrics are not as good as the others. but i recommend this to others.
B000003TAW|5.0|I am a 14 year old struggling guitarist in a relatively unculutured location, and music labeled popular to some (The Blue Album) is alternative in my community.  This is my favorite album for two reasons: 1) Every song on it is great, and 2) None of it ever gets old.  I can listen to this CD all the way through over and over again without ever becoming bored with any of the songs.  This CD is probably the greatest musical inspiration to me (as I previously stated, I am a guitarist looking for a band) and motivated me to run to the nearest music store and buy the fakebook for it.  Below I have provided a short analysis for each of the ten tracks (the short length is the album's only weakness).<br />1.  My Name Is Jonas<BR>The first track begins with a pretty acoustic guitar part that fades quickly into heavy distorted guitar beneath wonderfully fitting vocals.  I think that Weezer is trying to grab the listener's attention from the start with a great first track.  There is a small climactic build towards the end with a harmonica that brings out their talent in melodic songwriting.     (9/10)<br />2.  No One Else<BR>The first time I listened to this song I hated it, probably due to the shallow lyrics.  Lead singer Rivers Cuomo describes his paranoia in a relationship and his wishes for his girlfriend to never leave the house when he is gone.  Once you get past the unsatisfactory lyrics, it really is a great song with more melodic guitar parts and a catchy chorus.     (8/10)<br />3.  The World Has Turned and Left Me Here<BR>This song has always struck me as one of the better songs on the album, primarily for its excellent guitar solo and an chorus that will not leave your head for days.  I often find myself tapping out some of its rhythms in class.     (10/10)<br />4.  Buddy Holly<BR>This is the first song on the CD that is a single.  Despite its annoyingly short length, the song features an incredible guitar solo and an unforgivingly addictive chorus.  One of the album's less melodic songs, but fun to dance to.     (9/10)<br />5.  Undone-The Sweater Song<BR>This is the song that probably stands out as the most original on the album.  It opens with staged dialogue between two unknown male voices that describes a reunion of friends at a concert, irrelevant to the rest of the song.  There is then another unforgettable chorus, more dialogue, and a sudden modulation into a brilliant melodic guitar solo.  It ends with an unidentifiable instrument playing random notes.  This song features the absolute most repetitive chorus on the album.     (9/10)<br />6.  Surf Wax America<BR>If I had to pick one song on the album to remove, it would be this one.  Because this is the greatest album ever made, however, it still has to fall into the category of really good songs.  It definitely meets the criteria upon which my judgements are based.  I probably like it the least because it is less melodic than any of the others.  It features a three chord verse, three chord bridge, and three chord chorus.  There is an interesting middle section that is comprised entirely of a pretty harmony between all three singers in the band.     (7/10)<br />7.  Say It Ain't So<BR>This is my favorite song on the album, one of my favorite songs ever.  Say It Ain't So opens with an almost jazzy sounding verse due to a prominent baseline and odd guitar chords.  In the chorus, the song explodes into a woeful story, I think, about a young man's memories of a distressed childhood with a drunken father.  A fabulous guitar solo follows the bridge, and the song ends the way it begins, with the eerie jazzy sounding guitar riff.  The album is worth the money just for this song.  I don't know what happened to the brilliance that Weezer showed on The Blue Album and Pinkerton...     (10/10)<br />8.  In the Garage<BR>This song is an anthem to nerds everywhere.  The lyrics describe the garage (maybe the sight of the band's earlier practices?), a room filled with Dungeons and Dragonsapparatus and posters of rock group KISS.  In addition to wonderfully fulfilling lyrics, the song boasts another excellent guitar solo and creative use of a harmonica.  This song is kind of an adrenaline rush.     (9/10)<br />9.  Holiday<BR>Holiday opens with a bright bang with distorted guitars, the energy of which is not lost until a weird interlude towards the song's middle during which band members sing different parts.  The energy, however, is picked up again with more guitars and great vocal parts.  Another one that never leaves your head, but no guitar solo...     (9/10)<br />10.  Only in Dreams<BR>The ultimate geek ballad, Only in Dreams is the third masterpiece of the album.  I think the song is just over eight minutes long, but during this time the listener is never bored, but rather intrigued by this band's brilliance with chord progression and originality with guitar riffs.  This has all the elements of a great rock song: good contrast between the verse and chorus, great guitar solo, excellent build-up to the end, and lyrics that make you want to go home and kill yourself, unless you're listening to the album at home, in which case you can just do it there.  This song stays with you for years.     (10/10)<br />Definitely worth any amount of money.  If you're looking for other good stuff try Pinkerton-Weezer, Surfer Rosa-The Pixies, Warning-Green Day, Smash-The Offspring, Rubberneck-Toadies, (self-titled)-Sublime.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|EVERYBODY who doesn't know the name GAVIN DEGRAW is missing something extraordinary.  I call him the artist of the millenium and his first effort CD, &quot;Chariot&quot; simply put is GRAMMY bound.  Gavin's talent shines through on this CD with a range of different styles on this album, all proving that Gavin's vocal and musical ablity will be around for years to come.  His first single &quot;Follow Through&quot; showcases piano and voice, a mix of rock, jazz, and ballad.  For those who like the rock sound, try the tracks &quot;Chemical Party&quot; and &quot;I Don't Wanna Be&quot; all with that electric guitar feel.  For the ballad lovers there's &quot;Meaning&quot; &quot;More Than Anyone&quot; and &quot;Belief&quot;.  Every music lover will find this CD IMPOSSIBLE to stop listening to.  Seeing Gavin live will cement him forever in your mind as one the greatest live performers, EVER.  Gavin's personality and accessiblity along with his awesome manager Debbie Wilson, is sure to make him a musical ICON.  His sound, the best I can explain it, mixes Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and even a touch of Bon Jovi.  Don't MISS this chance to watch a rising star!!! Buy &quot;Chariot&quot; NOW, you won't REGRET it!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|After quite a long break Shania has returned. To many her appearence while on stage may seem distant but i for one believe what your seeing is a woman determined to do her best. Shania did the Chicago concert knowing that it would be broadcast on tv and go to dvd so at times she is definitely concentrating on where the cameras are at. But none of that takes away from the performance. If your a diehard fan you'll love it. If your just a fan i think you'll still find this dvd to be extremly enjoyable. If you've never seen shania before what better dvd to give her concert a try with then this.
B0000E1ALR|2.0|For the longest time, I've been wanting a complete &quot;Best of&quot; Bruce Springsteen.  The first &quot;best of&quot; a few years back, left off so many essential tracks.  So, when I heard that a new double CD of Bruce will be coming out, I thought, well OK, it's probably more Springsteen than I need, but at least, they will probably have all his charted hits.  But NO.  Again, that's not true.  My favorite songs from Bruce Springsteen (and they charted too), were &quot;Prove it All Night&quot;, &quot;Cover Me&quot;, and &quot;I'm on Fire&quot;.  &quot;I'm Goin' Down&quot;, and &quot;War&quot; shouldn't have been overlooked either.  What's going on here?  Who's the authority on putting this together?<br />The record company would probably say, &quot;Well, Bruce himself selected these songs because these are his proudest moments.&quot;  OK, that would be fine, but Bruce isn't the one that's expected to buy this collection.  The &quot;Billboard&quot; charts basically determine what we listeners know from an artist.  If that isn't considered when putting a collection together, then you're going to disappoint alot of fans.  Even if the song wasn't exactly my favorite, if it charted respectfully, than it should be in his &quot;Essential&quot; collection.  I'm sure that I'm not the only one out there who was looking forward to seeing these other songs in this collection.<br />Well, once again, I won't be buying the best of Bruce Springsteen.  Oh well, maybe Bruce himself will buy it.
B00003CXFV|1.0|First off, &quot;Erin Brokovich&quot; is an entertaining movie. How then does one rate a movie that, while entertaining, is promoted as a true story, but is in fact entirely half-truths, distortions and outright lies?<br />I thought it deserved 3 stars as entertainment but since it is promoted as &quot;based on a true story&quot; then it's entire premise is undermined.<br />The first giveaway in any Hollywood production is simply the phrase &quot;based on a true story&quot;. This usually signals major departures from reality. &quot;EB&quot; conveniently leaves out crucial facts. <br />For example no mention is made of the fact that the lawyer Albert Finney portrays was in real life a convicted felon. No mention is made of the fact that two high powered law firms were called in to actually handle the litigation. No mention is made of the fact that the settlement was paid out to plaintiffs in an arbitrary fashion with friends of Brockovich gettting larger shares, some got none. (In fact people with identical maladies got differing settlements. Some have yet to get anything. Attempts to contact Brockovich and her firm by these plaintiffs are ignored.) <br />Natually no mention is made of the fact that the toxin in question is proven to not be the cause of the ailments described.  The plaintiffs themselves called the movies &quot;lies&quot;.<br />No mention is made of the fact that the winning law firms hired a cruise ship for a celebration party at a cost of $350,000. Three of the judges on the arbitration panel that gave the $333 million judgement were at that party. <br />No mention is made of the fact that the lawyers took 40% of the settlement. Pretty good pay for &quot;fighting evil corporations&quot; isn't it? In fact there are few corporations more vicious and capitalist than movie companies. Julia Roberts herself get over 20 million per flick. Maybe these hollywood hyporcites should pay the plaintiff's legal bills. The settlement in actuality is passed on to the ratepayers of the State. If you live in California YOU are paying this money, not the &quot;evil corporation&quot;. So if you think this is a victory for the little guy you are fooling yourself.<br />There are true stories of local heroes who take on the criminal acts of corporations and governments and win. Why the shakedown artists in &quot;EB&quot; were picked to be lionized is a true mystery.<br />So while this flick is entertaining it is in reality a promotional piece for a gang of shakedown artists, the leading one being Erin Brockovich. Are the Director and screenwriters idiots or are they willing accomplices of this shakedown? <br />This movie is the worst sort of pandering.
0316666343|2.0|I found myself skipping paragraphs towards the end of the book just to get to the end. I heard so many great things about this book, but it didn't do it for me. Although, I did feel for Suzie, I didn't cry as some of my other friends had. I found myself more interested in the non-existent forensics of the crime, etc.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Movie lovers have waited many years for the kind of presentation offered in this outstanding reissue.  Some may consider the feature story a cynical depiction of warped Western values. However, it does give a very sympathetic portrait of the Mexican people whereas  they have often been depicted in cinema as uncivilized beasts.  As depicted by B. Traven we learn of the honesty of the young mexican lottery ticket seller even after he had been verbally and physically humiliated by Fred C. Dobbs, we learn of their satisfactory dispensation of justice to three Mexican thieves and murderers, and we learn of their reverence for knowledge.  Secondly,  the film shows an early example of environmental responsibility when the old man insists on &quot;repairing&quot; the mountain after the trio have mined it.  Thirdly,  Mr Bogart gives one of his most devastating over the top performances as a truly nasty character who gets a thoroughly deserved come-uppance when clubbed to death.  The film could be viewed as the allegory of the three archetypal characters - the good, the bad, and the innocent, or the three sides to every man.  And there is an undoubtedly great cinematic moment at the conclusion when the old man(the good) and the young man(the innocent) laugh almost to the point of pain at the fact the gold dust has been swept up by the wind and &quot;returned to the mountain&quot;  where it belongs.  Humanity, love, and civilisation prevail in the end.  The print quality is excellent.  But in addition to this the program may be viewed as one would see it when released - a contemporary newsreel, trailer for another film, a cartoon precede the &quot;main feature&quot;.  The real &quot;gold&quot; in the extras though, is a feature length documentary on the director John Huston, narrated by Robert Mitchum and featuring Lauren Bacall, Paul Newman and others.  The clips from some of Mr Huston's war documentaries, especially those associated with the US army landing in Italy must be some of the best war footage ever captured on film but remained classified by the US Army until 1980.<br />The discussion on courage, as understood by Mr Huston, is astonishing and memorable.  A remarkable documentary filled with many film clips including Mr Huston's private collection.  To me, this edition represents astonishing value for any film lover.some of the best war footage ever captured on film but remained classified by the US Army until 1980.  <BR>The discussion on courage, as understood by Mr Huston, is astonishing and memorable.

B00005JMJ5|5.0|The character development in A Human Stain should be an educational tool for filmakers of the future. This is a masterpiece of a drama with acting beyond compare. Nicole Kidman transforms herself each time she is on screen and makes you forget any character she had inhabited before. Hopkins and Sinese are wonderful. A Human Stain should be seen by all to view what a cinematic drama is supposed to be and the acting is a treasure to watch. The story line is insightful, but I won;t spoil this review by revelaing too much, you must see it, it will stay with you for years to come.
B00009ATIX|4.0|If you're looking for a different kind of science fiction movie, this one might be worth checking out.  Unlike most sci-fi, it has nothing to do with space battles, the colonization of alien planets or anything like that.  The plot of this film is a bit more introspective and perhaps even cerebral.<br />The movie has an eerie but not scary tone to it.  The story can also be described as erotic in timbre, although there is no nudity.  The subtle but pulsing soundtrack lends a hand to tell the story in a memorable fashion.  If you like movies with a mysterious flavor to them, you're bound to enjoy this one.<br />The basic premise of the movie centers around a research station that is way out there orbiting above a planet called Solaris.  While there, the crew encounters an ambivalent alien force and strange things begin to happen.  A shrink from Earth (George Clooney) is called in to investigate.<br />Unfortunately, instead of clearing things up, things get even stranger once the psychologist arrives at the station.  As there are so few crew on the station, the rest of the movie has more of a feel of a play than a standard film.<br />The one motif that passed thru my mind as I watched this film was the TWILIGHT ZONE.  If you like TZ and are open to watch a very different kind of sci-fi film, this one might be for you.  As a bonus, some of the special effects are downright spectacular and really bring out the capabilities of your HDTV / DVD setup.
B000002OMO|5.0|Besides the fact that music critics hated the album I thought it was great. In Bat out of Hell it told the story of a young man who escapes from hell to find his long lost love while the devil begins his search to bring him back. And then in Bat out of Hell II:Back into Hell the young man finds his lady love but only to confront his past sins while the devil finally catches up to him trying to bring him back to his realm. Both albums told a great story that combined romance with suspense. A fantastic roller coaster ride you don't want to end. I'm looking forward to the conclusion Bat out of Hell III: The Final Conflict.
B00005JM0B|1.0|There is a line in this movie in which the Arnie Terminator says &quot;It is time.&quot;  I so wish that someone would have told the writers and director that BEFORE this movie came out.  That is to say, it would have been nice if they had been notified that the TERMINATOR story had run its course.<br />Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and T3 was made.  This movie should be used as &quot;Exhibit A&quot; as to what happens when a good idea is recycled one too many times.  Instead of continuing w/the excellent story of 1 &amp; 2, this one comes off as generic, tired and rather silly.<br />One of the problems lies in the fact that the T-1000 from T2 didn't give the writers anywhere to &quot;go&quot; to make the Terminator in this one even more impressive.  So, what they come up with are some absurdly far-fetched powers that don't coincide very well with logic.<br />The lone bright spot of this movie is Kristanna Loken.  She is most assuredly cast perfectly as the new Terminator.  She is  drop-dead gorgeous, has a fantastic athletic body and she also has that &quot;don't mess with me&quot; look.  Seeing her come thru the time portal naked might just be worth the price of renting this movie - but the storyline certainly isn't.<br />It is sad that this movie was so bad, as T1 was a classic and T2 was even better.  All T3 does is throw in a lot of ad hoc details that un-do everything that T2 did.  Apparently the film-makers thought that the ending was going to be a big &quot;surprise.&quot;  Anyone who half paid attention to the movie could predict what would happen 1/3 of the way in.<br /> Sadly, the theme of the movie is nearly as predictable as how bad it looked like it was going to be.  For all TERMINATOR fans out there, I would admonish you to watch T1 &amp; T2 over and over again, but skip this one entirely.
B0000DBJDM|3.0|I was completely ready for this release!  It's the only thing missing from my essential rock videos collection.  The theatrical release was (and is) incredible!  Pink Floyd is a great band to watch live.  (Pink Floyd today is a Vegas production but back in the day &lt;pre Dark Side&gt; Floyd embodied an era of British style/fashion/psychedelic musical approach and was unrivaled!)  Live at Pompeii has all the Floydian elements, like the music itself it sneaks up on you and absolutely fills the senses with Pink Floyd's best music and appropriate visuals.  At the time (of it's theatrical release) I thought the band and the director were completely in sync, 30 years later.... I don't think so.  The directors vision and the original concert film show 2 differing paths.  Ok, the planets are trippy and the camera work matches the music but lay off the visuals and watch the original concert film.  No offense to the director, he did film a masterpiece, but....the director's cut is a piece of another kind!
B000002UA0|5.0|this is by far Pink Floyd's best recording to date.  After Sid Barrett left the music never sounded the same.  This first of all, is true psychadelic music in its purest form.  The imagery in the songs is amazing.  I especially love the song, &quot;The Gnome&quot;  which is based on the character Bilbo Baggins from the Tolkkien novels.  Syd Barret's song writing may seem simplistic and child-like, but that is where his genius is.  This album is full of fairy tale references and childbook creations from Syd's mind.<BR>now on to the music aspect.  the songs are true 60's psychadelia.  If you haven't listened to this era of Pink Floyd yet, keep in mind that it is VASTLY different than the David Gilmour era.  My two favorite songs musically are Atronomy Domine and Interstellar OVerdrive.  The ladder sounds like it could be from a cheesy 60's sci-fi flic, which is why it's so great.  It also borders on avant-garde, which Syd is often heralded as being at times.  <BR>this is a great album for anyone who is looking to get into 60's psychadelic music and also for anyone who wants to explore the original Pink Floyd.
B00005JM02|1.0|The first time I saw this movie I'll admit I liked it. But when I watched it for a second time, I realized what an awful movie it is. It was just so boring. I couldn't stand to watch it. And it really makes no sense. I mean, fish don't really care that much for their offspring. They lay tons of eggs, and some die. It just annoyed me how the fish were acting like people. And what's the deal, with the sharks not eating fish? What else would they eat? They survive off of fish. Ugh. I don't understand how so many people can like this. I really hate this movie.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|You got to give credit to this girl. For someone who's 22, an awkward age, struggling to prove adulthood but still not really there, it does help to get a little push from the likes of Madonna, Moby, R. Kelly and even P. Diddy. Her lyrics may be stepping on the provocative area but hey, if you listen to the tracks, you'd know that there's effort in making the tracks as personal as possible, beats as groovy, as diverse, as listenable, and as danceable. Her fans have grown up and it was a smart move to let them grow with her, and at the same time expand the listeners to people like us. Way to go!
B0000E1WNV|5.0|Some artists are great songwriters but their live performances are either pedestrian, predictable, or uneven.  They may be great if you catch them on the right night, but may phone it in for other shows.  Bob Dylan is in this category.  Other artists or bands put on an exciting show, but their catalog of truly great music is limited.  This will raise some disagreement, but I see The Who in this category - while I certainly acknowledge that some of the greatest hard rock ever written comes from Pete and the boys, their creative flame burned brightly for only a few years.  Of course, there are the Dinosaurs, the once great groups that haven't produced any good music in many years, yet tour and tour as tribute bands to themselves.  The Rolling Stones top this list.<br />Then there is Bruce. His live performances have been legendary for over 30 years.  There are no mediocre Springsteen concerts - there are great shows and the shows that are better than that.  If you were to see Bruce perform for the first time you would think that surely he was playing his last show ever.  He saves nothing for the next night.  No one puts it all together better - he is simultaneously one of rocks greatest writers and performers.  In their biography, VH1 matter of factly refers to him as \\"the world's greatest living rock n' roll star.\\"  His records are arguably among the greatest in rock history (a recent poll in Rolling Stone ranked Born to Run (1975) as rocks greatest album).  His range is astounding.  His concerts are a lot like a Broadway musical, with much better (and louder) music. The audience leaves a Springsteen show having experienced the important human emotions.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll feel the sheer exhilaration of being glad you're alive.<br />Rock and roll doesn't come across well on television.  It is meant to be experienced live and loud.  However this DVD (which was released in November, 2003, not 2000 as your Amazon date indicates - the Barcelona show was in the late summer of 2002) brings the viewer about as close to live Bruce as the medium allows.  It probably does about as well as Saving Private Ryan in creating the feeling of being in combat without having to actually deal with imminent death.<br />The crowd response is enthusiastic and very much like many of the 43 Springsteen shows I have attended.  The show was performed toward the beginning of the hugely successful international tour in support of his 2002 album, \\"The Rising.&quot;  Unlike the Dinosaurs, about ten of 24 songs are from that album.

0385504209|5.0|This is THE mystery/historical and overall best book of the season. If anyone has a better book to offer I'd like to see it. The book revealed many unknown facts to me, and made me reevaluate my opinion of the Catholic Church.
B000001IPP|1.0|What a terrible band. They try way to hard in their videos. They act like they are punk but they are not. They wear the spikey hair, I would compare them to Good Charlotte (wannabe Punkers). First of all the songs on this cd were pretty terrible. They try to hard in their songs. They should focus on being a real band instead of fake so they could have time to write actual good songs. What a terrible band!
156898443X|5.0|This is a great book. One that you will pass on to friends that are going through trials. It is a great gift when you are not sure how to help someone in need. The combination of text and illustration is unique and engaging. The book provides perspective on the challenges of life without preaching or attempting to provide a quick fix. This book will have a lasting impact.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is a great Album, I still enjoy listening to it.It ain't Pearl Jam, it ain't Radiohead. But it is good stuff. Those die hard Pearl Jam fans think '10' was the birth of grunge or???... But really if you look at it like this husker du,the pixies,big Star and Early Jesus and mary chain, all had done this sort of stuff. It was orginal in the 60's 70's and some of the 80's. The 90's we got it rehash and repackaged with younger fresher faces, and we loved it.But it was as about as orginal as ... Nothing new was made. <BR>So It is funny to think that who is better Pearl Jam or Nirvana? Or whos ideas started whos? Who cares?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Like Elvis Presley before them, The Beatles were one of those rare occurences in the history of the world where a form of popular music, of &quot;pop&quot; culture, completely turned the world around. You can't just categorize them as a normal rock band, this is the group that basically popularized the word &quot;Rock Band.&quot; &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; is a perfect source for anyone looking for the hits that made the band popular and classic. The purists will of course scoff at the idea of holding this up as the essential Beatles collection, and in a sense they're right, considering these are just the #1 hits and anyone who really wants to listen to The Beatles should of course listen to &quot;Revolver&quot; and the immortal &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot; But for you, the casual purchaser who simply wants to have the cool cuts and cultural favorites, this is the album to look for. The music is still vibrant and fun, &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; is good pop fare, better than anything Justin Timberlake can dream-up today, it's fun and with a good vibe that dissects what any devoted boyfriend feels. More melodic efforts are &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; with it's driving force and &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; which feels almost Indian, a taste of what The Beatles did with other Hindu-influenced tunes like the timeless &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot; And okay, maybe not ALL of their deep material is here (&quot;Love Me Do&quot; is fun, but come on, it's not exactly intellectual), but a good deal of it is like &quot;Let It Be,&quot; a wonderfully evocative anthem that only grows better with the passage of time. Times are different today than in 1964, but before the Summer Of Love, before &quot;Light My Fire&quot; or &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; &quot;She Loves You&quot; was already a generation-stirring number. The sound of the band is, of course, always heavily sought after, think of Stone Temple Pilots and The White Stripes. We will never see the likes of The Beatles again, &quot;1&quot; is a wonderful documentation of great songs from an important <BR>time and place in music history.

B0000CDLA7|2.0|Not a very strong outing from one of my favorite bands, especially as a follow up to the amazing performance of &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;.<BR>Rumor had been &quot;Train of Thought&quot; would be an astounding combination of the flavors heard on &quot;Awake&quot; and &quot;Images and Words&quot; but I was nothing but crestfallen upon my first listen.<br />&quot;Train Of Thought&quot;, the latest creation of progressive rock gods Dream Theater plows through an array of heavy rhythmic low end groove for 7 tracks, half being ten plus minutes in length. <br />Bassist Myung and Drummer Portnoy are nothing short of energetic steering their way through the limitless boundaries of time changes and stops and defined on past Dream Theater recordings. However, hardcore Dream Theater fans might find guitarist Petrucci's finger work a bit lacking, I did. I was hoping for a solid outing of full alone standing non-concept album songs as we last heard with their album &quot;Awake&quot; but instead I found myself frustrated with too many heavy power chord type pounding and not enough light single note melodies. Labrie's vocals are once again inspiring but I found the melodies sung lacking in anything that will stick with me.<br />Defining moments are Track One, the introduction. &quot;As I Am&quot; fades in like a dream emerges and quickly drops the listener into classic DT musical phrasing. It would be a great song if the rest of the album wasn't so seemingly monotonous in it's sound. Track five &quot;Vacant&quot; lightens the mood and seems to release us from the too Metallica-esque hammering, but sadly only for 2 minutes. &quot;Stream Of Consciousness&quot; goes where &quot;Erotomania&quot; didn't thanks to the impressive keys work by Ruddess and sucks you to a almost Liquid Tension performance. By far I think the best track on the album is the last. &quot;In The Name Of God&quot; reveals what the rest of the album should of been. Thought and emotion provoking text creatively coupled with past Dream Theater-esque dark melodies. It opens up the listener to what this album could have been and sadly is not.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|After years of waiting the DVD release of this movie was long overdue.  However, it must be said that the visual and sound qualities on the DVD are WELL beyond anything I have ever seen on video tape (either 1/2&quot; VCR or broadcast).  Paramount Home Video is to be commended.<br />The film has an eerily new feel as if it were shot this year.  The formerly magnificent scenes are even more breathtaking (through my progressive scan DVD and 64&quot; screen).  And the sound remixed for Dolby Digital 5.1 finally establishes the voices and the essential accompanying music in the right place.<br />This is a stunning effort of restoration and fortunately the effort was lavished on a movie that was worth every bit of it!
0316666343|4.0|Strange, uplifting and tormenting all at the same time but ultimately growth and acceptance...   One of the best books i've read in years...  I agree that it compares positively with &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; ...  I smiled while crying...  Is definitely worth reading and I could not put it down.
B00004VWAF|3.0|But it's still intersting. This may have been in part an attempt at selling out, or something done as a failed experiment, or it may the jazz equivalent of &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;-No, there's no feedback here, and it's not really very noisey, either-but it is irritating in a similar (but more layed back) way. It's almost as lame as the kind of jazz albums Tom Scott made, there's an element of Muzak, and a hint of the relatively weak Music Miles made after 1980, a little bit of Herbie Hancock's boring funk. Miles plays well, but comes off as almost a session man, or maybe a member of the band (not really as leader, or solo artist). It all sounds basically the same, and there are long stretches where Miles is playing little or not all. You hear about how wild this is, and Miles has done some definitely wild things-then you listen, and you feel taken, because this is almost a big NOTHING-but the more you listen, it starts to grow on you. Yes, there is something worthwhile here-even boring, funky crap, it turns out, can be done well. There's something downright AMBIENT going on herer, this could be seen as Music Concrete straght from the corner-monotonous street noises, and monotonous funk coming from Boom Boxes. Taken in this way, this is actually an experimental album, and an interesting one at that. Miles was up for the Nobel Prize in Biochemistry for this at the time of his death, I think. Buy this to support excellence in Science.
6305882592|1.0|How can I list all the horrible things in this movie? A young man getting it on with a woman old enough to be his great grandmother is anything but entertaining.  Expressing suicide as something humorous shouldn't be portrayed in ANY film let alone one that is rated PG.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone...EVER.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It's clear when watching this tribute concert for George Harrison that he was well-loved by his friends because their love for him shines through in this tasteful, beautifully played concert.  The artistry of Clapton, McCartney, Jeff Lynne and a large supporting cast is outstanding and in top form.  It's difficult to see McCartney perform the gorgeous Harrison classic, &quot;Something,&quot; without getting a lump in your throat or a tear in your eye.  Other highlights include Clapton ripping through &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; just as he did on the original recording with the Beatles, &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; performed by Billy Preston, and Paul McCartney singing &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot;  The final song, the oldie, &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams,&quot; is as beautiful to watch as it is to hear.  The sound quality is excellent and there was not a wrong note played or a false note sung.  Truly an excellent concert and a beautiful tribute to their friend.
B000005RPX|5.0|This is the (almost) complete release of the Japanese tour (3 dates!), August 1972. This is DP Mk. II at their finest, and it is from these tapes that the classic &quot;Made in Japan&quot; album was cut. The present disc collects all three shows, Osaka I, Osaka II, and Tokyo, minus &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; from Night 1, encores from N2, and mule from N3- all explained in the 24p liner notes.<BR>For serious collectors and fans, hear interesting variations on the same material, including Blackmore f$*#ing up &quot;Smoke on the water&quot; -twice! Also, disc is remixed at Abbey Road. ROCK!
B00000I5Y6|5.0|This is the first Kansas album that I bought and all I can say is that it is SO good and definitely the best album to start with if you're interested in Kansas.  Almost everyone has heard their most popular hit (Carry on My Wayward Sun)  Mix Electric Light Orchestra, Mannheim Steamroller, and Boston, and for the most part you've got Kansas!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|-<BR>It's a rare celebrity / charity concert that can offer any surprise at this point in rock history.  Honestly, they're really never too bad.  You nearly always get competent (if not tasteful) renditions of the usual hits, and when McCartney is involved, there's always the singalong \\"Let it Be\\" or \\"Hey Jude\\" to conclude the night.<br />What a great pleasure, and a very great surprise the present dvd is!  The performances are so fine (halleluiah), the song selection so coherent, and general mood so sincere and warm, that the Concert for George must surely rank among the very best celebrity concerts ever.  That this all happens despite such a huge band (was that four drummers?!) is a tribute to somebody's taste and restraint, probably Clapton's, though maybe Lynne's.  Albert Hall is also a more photogenic locale than your usual rock venue and the filming/editing gives no great cause for complaint.<br />Would it be heretical to suggest that Clapton's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and McCartney's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" surpass the originals?  One way or another, it's a tribute to George, the strength of his songwriting, and the love he inspired in those closest to him.<br />A very fine concert and a good dvd.  Very highly recommended.<BR>-

B00004STDN|4.0|After a string of ill-conceived comedies, Stallone returned to what he did best in 1993; the action junket.  Armed this time with a pedigree to prove, and a director that knows his stuff (Renny Harlin), Sly became a box-office sensation once more, and wowed audiences all over the world with this phenomenal thriller.<br />The acting is average, with a few bright spots; John Lithgow (in his third incarnation as a villain--the others being &quot;Ricochet&quot; and &quot;Raising Cain&quot;) overshadowing Stallone in a battle of one-liners, and Michael Rooker, who always manages to put in a solid effort in whatever film he's in.  The real star of this movie, however, isn't the superbly filmed action, but the cinematography.<br />Set in the Italian Dolemites, the scenery is breathtaking--some of the best mountain footage seen in theatres in a long time.  When there's a break in the action, you're enthralled by the background, which isn't always the case with any movie, let alone an action flick.  Much props to the director for filming most of this movie on location.<br />The DVD is pretty good, and the commentary track is reasonable--but with DTS sound, and a quality surround system, this movie looks and sounds phenomenal.  They've done a great job with the video transfer, considering that DVDs would only become popular about five years after this film was released.
B000084T18|5.0|We've heard it all before...a hyped up debut album drops and sells by the millions...and the underground fans hate it no matter what the lyrics sound like.<BR>That seems to be whats happening on this review board. First of all, the lyrics are sick. Yes 50 Cent's image of coming from the streets and getting shot 9 times has a lot to do with this album's success, but never the less, the lyrics on this album are some of the best of any recent album to come out. Not only are the lyrics on every track sick (with the exception of In da Club and 21 questions, the only teenybopper dance club garbage on this album) but the beats are also sick (thanks to legendary producer Dr Dre)<BR>Best songs:<BR>Many Men 5/5 - Great Song, great lyrics, great hook, great flows, real history behind this track.<BR>Patiently Waiting 5/5 - Oh my God...This is the best track on the album. Great hook and lyrics by 50, and sick lyrics with incredible flow by Eminem.<BR>Blood Hound 4/5 - The lyrics on this track are for real, he's been to jail, sold crack, and been shot 9 times. Need I say more?<BR>Not Like Me 5/5 - Bonus track 18...this is a sick song that features some of 50's best lyrics on the album. Great Track.<BR>Don't Push Me 4/5 - Sick lyrics and hook from 50, Sick beat, good lyrics from Lloyd Banks of G Unit and Eminem
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore's score for &quot;The Return of the King&quot; is as evocative and moving as his earlier two scores for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; respectively.  Like its predecessors, it contains a lot of new music and does not slavishly repeat exactly any of the themes we have heard in the other scores.  The tracks included are much more symphonic and lush musically than the more strident tracks on &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.  In this way, it hearkens back to the musicality of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, especially in the longer reprisals of the Shire and Fellowship themes from that score.  Of special delight are the contributions of soprano Renee Fleming and flautist Sir James Galway.  The final track &quot;Into the West&quot; sung by Annie Lennox sums up the sadness of the story's ending quite beautifully. For anyone who is a fan of these films, and especially of Howard Shore's music, this CD is a must-have.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|Watching Scarface for the second time was a treat.  Pacino is awesome as Tony Montana.  From a Cuban immigrant with nothing he rises to become a gangster kingpin.  On that trip, Pacino hits all the right notes.  The screenplay is awesome.  The many memorable lines will echo all over the room as soon as they're spoken.  Pfeiffer is ideal as the cadaverous gold digger wife.  F. Murray Abraham, cast as Omar, does not disappoint.<br />Montana's relentless drive to succeed fuels both his rise and fall.  Despite his criminal acumen, he lives by a code throughout his life.  He says he has nothing but his word and his balls, and he's not breaking either.  Late in the movie, during an assassination attempt, he saves the lives of some children. Also, in a jealous rage over his sister, he kills his best friend and right-hand man.  Cornered by hundreds of drug cartel thugs, he fights until the bitter end, when he falls in a hail of bullets in his mansion.  <br />The DVD comes stacked with extras, including a making of Scarface and a 20-minute film extolling the film as a hiphop classic, featuring the commentary of P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg, and other rappers.  <br />No doubt Scarface is not only a hiphop classic, but an American classic.<br />ken32
0224619101|5.0|This is a superbly plotted panel book in which every story ends with some sort of twist or irony. I write only to correct one error made by an earlier reviewer. Lambert's plane is NOT 'Joe for King', but 'the Creaking Door'. The CO is so out of touch that he mistakes the planes, thereby indirectly saving Lambert's life, much to his young wife's relief. (The casualty rates were horrific for bomber crews.)<br />  It is somewhat amusing that the reviewer made the same mistake.
B00005JL96|5.0|I'm not a big Disney fan, but I do enjoy two of their movies--Mulan and Lilo and Stitch.  Mulan has enough action to keep me satisfied, while Lilo and Stitch is geniuenly funny on more than one level.<br />Kids, of course, are going to love Stitch and the aliens.  Now, they are funny, but for me, the funniest part of the movie is the interaction between Lilo and her older sister.<br />I, myself, have a younger brother who's thirteen years younger than I, so I found myself laughing hysterically because I've been in those situations.  The joke about &quot;maybe you should trade me in a get a rabbit instead!&quot; is still a favorite around my parent's house.<br />In any event, this has been the funniest Disney movie in years.  Anybody with kids needs this on their movie shelf.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This is my absolute all-time favorite television show.  I was in 10th grade when the show aired, so, since the characters were also in 10th grade, I related completely.  This is the most realistic drama I have ever seen.  I do have other favorite shows, such as Dawson's Creek and Felicity, but this will always take the cake.  I love owning this DVD set so I can view the episodes whenever I want.<br />To the person who posted the poor quality on the DVD: The show was originally aired that way!  I always thought it was rather strange how dull the colors were but that is how they did it.  I won't complain, since the show itself makes up for the camera work!
0783231032|3.0|The premise for this movie is simple enough: a Japanese submarine, two weeks after the attack at Pearl Harbor, seeks to destroy the will of the American populace by destroying Hollywood.  However, they get a little lost.<br />The Americans, in the meantime, are dealing with anti-Japanese hysteria, insane fighter pilots, well-meaning (but destructive) tankers, and riots between Army soldiers and Navy sailors.<br />The movie is quite funny, but it's just too long.  Comedies shouldn't last for more than an hour and half, two hours at the most, but 1941 drags on for nearly 3 hours.  By that time, all the jokes have been told, and it seems that the characters have resorted to filler.
6304981635|3.0|A milestone in the history of chop-socky, Enter the Dragon made quite a splash on its release in 1973 as a fast-moving, hard-hitting martial arts thriller.  It is still well-regarded today in some circles (vide infra), although it has a little less zip than today's hyperkinetic, ultra-glossy and meticulously choreographed onscreen thrill rides.  The movie opens with a demonstration fight scene between Bruce Lee and a rather tubby and unmenacing Sammo Hung.  After this prelim it settles into about an hour of mostly action-free exposition and set-up.  One of the most notable features of old 70s movies is their slow pace.  Today somebody says \\"I'm leaving\\" and next shot, they're in their car.  Or in LA.  Back then, they'd get off the couch, walk to the door, open it, leave, close it from the outside, close the screen door, go down the walk to their car, fish for their keys, etc, etc.  Of course, back in the day, if you weren't watching a movie you were probably on your front porch whittling, or at a pinochle party, so folks probably figured that pace was plenty fast enough.  Anyway, BL gets filled in by our man on HM's secret service, Braithwaite (Geoffrey Weeks - in his only screen role).  The historically-minded may recall that in the 1970s Hong Kong was actually controlled by Britain, hard as that may be to imagine now.  Characters like Braithwaite are even harder to imagine.  If they weren't preserved on film we'd have trouble believing they ever existed.  The man is actually a gem.  Even the name is excellent.  Braithwaite.  Whatever happened to those old names?  Carruthers.  Protheroe.  Montague-Smythe.  Why don't we see these names in movies anymore?  Anyway, to continue - there's a bad guy, Mr Han, and he's holding a martial arts tournament and BL has to enter and blah blah.  The rubber ducky is that Mr Han's lustful flunkies killed BL's sister, as shown in a flashback sequence most notable for its bad choreography, where the hapless sister has to fall and makeseveral pointless detours for the sole purpose of allowing her bumbling pursuers to catch up.  Trapped at last she chooses death over dishonour at the hands of a fearsome New Zealander (Bob Wall).<BR>     The various martial arts contenders finally assemble, and a white-bread bunch they are, too.  Jim Kelly is actually the worst, that is the nicest, of the lot.  If he put on a blonde wig you'd think he was Doris Day.  They sail off to meet evil Mr Han (Shih Kien), a classic Bond villain - a forty-something turtlenecked playboy with a taste for the finer things in life and his own private island, complete with subterranean power plant, chemical labs and dungeon, as well as a retinue of nubile bodyguards and a totally supercilious attitude which is ultimately stripped aside to reveal a rat-like viciousness.  Also, he's missing a hand, which means he can conveniently slot into his wrist any standard vacuum cleaner attachment, or, should the need arise, stabbing blades.<BR>     After a bit of intrigue and snooping around the island we finally - finally! - get down to brass tacks, with BL decisively kicking incompetent hench-bottom in numbers.  The action sequences are pretty decent.  But what really marks them out is how amazing BL looks without a shirt.  And with little slash marks even better.  That's the payoff for being a martial arts pro.  This is not something that even today's modern iron-pumping method stars can easily imitate.  Six months with a personal trainer are not going to make you look like this.  BL at the tournament and the brawl at the end.  None of it is very violent.  These guys sometimes stomp on each other, but all you actually see is the winner from the midsection up.  You see him jump up and land.  Then for extra brutality he makes a twisting motion, which presumably deforms the broken body of his opponent into an irretrievable wreck.  I jump on you, see?  Then I twist.  You're finished.  The other thing that makes the fight scenes truly memorable are BL's battle squeaks of \\"Wuuuuuuuuuuu...ahhhh!\\" which sound kind of like Curly Howard being dubbed into Chinese.  Or Jim Carey imitating Bruce Lee.  This is one part of BL's legacy that does not seem to have survived in current martial arts films.  That and the psychotic grimaces he makes after every blow.  In the end general mayhem erupts and BL sets off after Han, finally cornering him in the hall of mirrors.  Presumably a circus setting for the finale would have been too much of a plot stretch, to say nothing of the extra production costs it would have incurred.<BR>     The other entertaining aspect of the film are the priceless little period details that remind us fondly of a bygone time.  Like the giant golf-cart phone (and the restrained comedy of the golf course shakedown scene is excellent, by the way); or Kelly's massive headphones, not to mention his huge wing collars and his burgundy suit; or Braithwaite's dinner-plate sized glasses.<BR>     Overall, a historic martial arts document and a precious reminder of BL's star quality.  A must for martial arts fans and cultists.  General viewers may find it just a teensy bit slow.  Another fine movie, however, which fans may wish to check out is the entertaining Game of Death, which, incidentally, has the added bonus of accounting for the origin of Uma Thurman's jumpsuit in Quentin Tarantino's recent masterpiece Kill Bill.
0446530891|4.0|David Baldacci once again displays that he is simply one of the best writers in America today with another attention grabbing, rapidly paced, action-mystery-adventure.<br />You will create strong attachment to his characters as they twist you through an intriguing plot.  They are wholly likeable and believable and you can't help but develop a true vested interest in their lives and decisions.<br />In Split Second, Baldacci pulls together two presidential candidate mysteries set eight years apart and weaves them into a fast moving, complex and plausible story.<br />Baldacci demonstrates his knack for letting the story unfold like a quick drive down a country road with unmarked curves that keep you guessing which way the story will turn next.<br />Be forewarned, the story grabs you on the first page and carries you straight away to the end, as I literally had to finish it the same day I started.
6303109950|5.0|The best part of this movie is Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. His performance is outstanding and I was never a Kilmer fan, until now. I agree with the other reviewer to be shocked Val Kilmer was not nominated for an award, it is his best work.  He is so real in this role it is hard to think of him as any other character.  No one could have delivered even one of his lines with a more convincing style and accent than he did.<br />Kurt Russell owns the role of Wyatt Earp and he is excellent in it, but he is Kurt Russell and well, what more needs to be said besides lucky Goldie Hawn and more westerns Kurt, please. The other characters were good, but lacked the on-screen bond or loyalty between them that Kilmer delivered as Doc for Wyatt and the family as a whole. What ever you pay for this movie, either DVD or VHS, it is a movie you will watch over and over, if for nothing more than to watch and listen to Kilmer as Doc Holliday. <br />I love westerns and the movie Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner was no comparison at all. Until this movie, Kirk Douglas owned the role of Doc Holliday for me, now Val Kilmer is Doc Holliday and he has earned that honor with the performance he delivered.
B00000FYIL|3.0|The score itself rates at least a 4 out of 5, for reasons others have already given, but I take off a point because the CD release doesn't include the street music.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Kind of paltry. Kind of odd, too. I'm happy to have different versions of Beatles songs but really there aren't huge differences over what we've heard on the original LIB, Anthology and Past Masters. And a CD has more space than an LP - so why remove any content?  The second disc is meaningless and gives us precious little song material. If the title and cover weren't so awful, if the marketing was more honest and if the second disc had been a good collection of the volumous LIB outtakes (some which, if edited skillfully, could make decent new Beatle songs), I would have rated this higher.
B000005DQR|5.0|...But with that and the exorbitant price I paid for DJ Shadow's phenomenal \\"Endtroducing...\\" notwithstanding, I thouroughly enjoyed this CD from beginning to end.  I have recently gotten hip to the \\"cut-n-paste\\" sounds, as masterfully done by Amon Tobin, but in DJ Shadow I find his sampling style a bit more consistent and less \\"noisy\\". Check out any Tobin CD and you'll see what I mean.  Although I'm several years late getting \\"Endtroducing...\\", I find it just as up-to-date as most CDs I've bought this year, which attests to the quality of Shadow's music.  Even in 96, he was obviously ahead of his time, and foresaw where the music of today was headed.  \\"Endtroducing...\\" is indeed a classic in its own right, much like a Prince CD (before all of his name changes, of course)...no matter how old it gets, it will always be enjoyable to listen to.  I won't go into details as to which songs I like on \\"Endtroducing...\\", because they all are excellent and well produced gems. I have only one small problem, though...SONG #10--WHY HIPHOP SUCKS IN 96--the funkiest groove I have ever heard--IS TOO DAMN SHORT!!!!
1402541783|5.0|A cute, sleepy private eye story told form the perspective of Precious Ramotswe, and narrated well by Lisette Lecat. In this episode, we find Precious investigating two cases: that of a philandering husband, and that of an older man who once committed a crime and wishes to make amends.<br />What's good about this series is not the mystery. It's the characters and settings. I really got the flavor that I was in a small town in Botswana, and I enjoyed reading about Precious and her cohorts. If I have any criticism about this novel at all, there was a lack of suspense. The investigation was almost a non-event, and there was a bit too much dwelling in the past for my taste. Part of me wanted to tell the client: GET OVER IT ALREADY. The past is over and done with.<br />Still, a cute story, sure to delight readers who want a slice of African life without too much gritty realism.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania thank you for putting together this excellent DVD. It would be so cool if you could make a new DVD every week with such power and such great music and songs. I found this to be just totally filled with the trademarks that makes Shania who she is. It has the great songs, music, band and Shania at her best. Thanks for a great DVD filled with so much of who you are and what it takes to be that. I know that by the way yo respond to your fans you would be saying your welcome and feeling a little shy over it all. Buy and enjoy an evening with Shania over and over.
185984054X|5.0|At face value, this book is damning to the reputation of Mother<BR>Teresa.  And this is exactly where most reviews should end. But in my opinion, this book is well written, terse and funny. Morality has nothing to do with Christianity, and this is the sad part about religion in general.  Yes, Chris Hitchens is not Mother Teresa's biggest fan, but he writes this book through facts, and and the questionable deeds of the subject herself.  That's why this book has been really helpful to me. I know nothing about Mother Teresa except the saintly portraiture I see on television once in a while and sadly, on top of my patients' overhead tables who are dying or suffering from pain.  She was a patient at one of the most exclusive hospital in Torrey Pines in California sometime in the early 90's.  People that work there still talk about it as though they were visited by the Virgin Mary herself. But when I ask basic questions like, Why did she have to came all the way here in La Jolla, CA to ge treated?  Who is she anyway? And stuff like, who paid for her treatment? I was treated like a bothersome child and at worst a heretic for asking such questions.  I guess we have lost our own ability to be objective. In conclusion,I value this book for being a tool of objectivity.  I should drop a start though, because it was too short.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have watched Shania's career and have enjoyed watching some specials on her and all she has done in her life. She has always put herself at the end of the line to help others in her family. She has always worked hard to obtain her goals of seeing her family raised, and her career go forward. This has paid off in the great music and fun in this DVD. She has come up and out of shell so to speak and has made a DVD that will lighten the hearts of all who hear it. Shania is a preformer who has found who she is and what it is she wants to accomplish. She is Shania and no one can do it better and no one can do it the same. This DVD is great and it is Shania.
B00009P1O0|4.0|THe first time I listened to On the beach, i hated it. Where were the soft guitars and easy listening tracks of Harvest? The album really does not hit you all at once, like all really good ones. It hits you in sections, like the beutiful motion pictures or the rocking vampire blues. In the end, I simply loved it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD has what each and everyone of us wants. It has the music the songs Shania getting ot with the fans and doing a little bit of dancing. It has it all because it is the best of Shania. It is the best Shania has put out in DVD form. She has the best of her songs and the new releases for us to enjoy. Shania has what we all want and she gives it all to us in this DVD.
6305128952|1.0|Man, I love horses, I love their intelligent eyes, their gentle side, their wild side, just everything about them. Along with Swift, I believe that humans are just yahoos to them.  So I thought this movie will deal with horses, with real communication with them, and follow the story of Monty Roberts.  Unfortunately, most of the movie is spent ... crying.  There's more crying happenning in this movie than at a figure-skating gathering. At one point I caught myself muttering \\"enough already!\\".  Yes, it's not very sensitive to be un-sympathetic to an injured child.  But what's worse than that is to depict the story in such HOLLYWOOD way -- a heaping spoon of sham, trite, and cliches.  The endless crying simply feels fake.  Its only purpose is to jerk a tear from an audience that's too tired of other side of Hollywood - mindless shoot-em-up macho baloney.<br />To those folks who don't get out much, ask yourselves \\"Is rural Montana really like that?\\"  Where are the yokel 4-wheeling grit-chewing road-kill-frying rednecks??  Where are the people who are regularly brought up on cruelty to animals charges?  Everyone is the movie seems to be well-bathed, well-fed, and (!) have a good dentist.<br />This movie is a big FAKE, start to finish.  It does not enlighten, it does not inspire, it only irritates ad nauseum.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania has found and put into this DVD the most enjoying music and songs. She has redone the older songs with a renewed energy and voice. She has put the same energy and voice into the new songs. To fully enjoy Shania Up Live In Chicago you must have the DVD because the show on T.V. does not hold all that is in the DVD. So find out what enjoyment in music and song is and listen to this DVD and do yourself a real favor and enjoy it day after day in your home by owing this DVD.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish!<BR>An impressive combination of humor and tenderness.<BR>The cast alone warranted my seeing this film, but I did not expect to be so delightfully entertained.  Needless to say, I plan to see it again.
B000089RVR|3.0|I admit, Dido's music takes me a long time to warm up to.  It was months after I'd heard her debut record that I finally started liking it.  For the moment, Life for Rent sounds like a good effort to me, but one which is a little too content to stay in the moody, polite spectrum of music.<br />Even on No Angel, the tracks I loved the most were the more ferocious rock/dance tracks which contrasted Dido's whispery, restrained voice against a muscular musical backdrop -- &quot;Hunter&quot; and the Youth-produced rhythmic monster &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; being the best examples.  There is no such track here.  Dido's lyrics have improved greatly, the emotional exposes of &quot;White Flag&quot; and &quot;Life for Rent&quot; being expressive far beyond the levels of any song on &quot;No Angel&quot;.  There is also no Hallmark card sentiment here akin to &quot;Thank You&quot; from No Angel.  However, this record does need contrasting elements, shades, and quite simply, uptempo tunes to vary the pacing and enhance the effect when the slow tracks *do* come in.<br />Dido music has been called &quot;coffeehouse&quot; by some, and I think she should look into bringing in some new blood into her collaborative circle.  Her music *is* on the verge of becoming easy listening, and she's proved that she is capable of more.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is the heaviest CD from this guys and they are not afraid to show their different music styles and influences, thats one thing to recognize them. Still it has the progressive DT touch but it's a Metal album.<br />One word to describe this album: Evolution<br />They are not staying in the past, they are changing with time. In my opinion this is not their best album but worth the money and the listening.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I enjoy music.  I am not someone who dislikes Britney.  I had hopes that this would be a good album.  Though I was not fond of the single &quot;In the Zone&quot;  I bought the album anyway.  BIG MISTAKE!  This album has no substance.  It's not a lasting record.  All the songs sound alike.  The tune is bleak, with mainly a lot of Britney moaning and groaning, but not so much singing.  The song &quot;Everytime&quot; is okay, though it does sound more like a 13yr olds letter written to a boy that broke her heart in jr. high.  <BR>The bottom line is that this album sounds like something thats gone wrong in the club scene.  Almost like she wrote it while on extacy.  Not like something I'd want to hear everyday.  Britany comes accross as a lost little girl who wants to be made into a woman, but isn't ready to act like ne yet.
B00008EYA5|4.0|In the beginning, I wasn't that much interested in watching SWAT. But I went anyway, expecting a kind of pilot-of-the-series with lots of endlesse gun-shots, unbelievable car-chases, predictable plot-twists, etc. I was wrong.<br />SWAT is a very good action movie. The script was written in a way so that the viewer does not increase mental activity even for a second while watching the film. And that's not bad. SWAT is pure action, from beginning to end. There's no emotional elements (well, in fact we get a glimpse of Farrell's character's love life, but that's just a scene), there're no plot-twists or plot-holes that made me role my eyes. You know who's good and who's bad from the start. No surprises. Just go along with the action and everything will be fine.<br />In the end, the viewer fells he/she was not cheated. This movie doesn't treat the watchers on a condescendent basis, like they were dumb. Collin Farrell (shaved now) and Samuel Jackson are the acting pillars that support the good direction, tailor-made, though not revolutionary, for an action flick.<br />Grade 8.3/10
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is talented enough on her own, but when you add her band, it is excellent. My family can't get enough of this DVD. She has an excellent band. They are great to listen too, but are also entertaining to watch.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I own and have reviewed the &quot;LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring&quot; gift-set.  I said in that review that that gift-set would &quot;delight&quot; the receiver.  The &quot;Two Towers&quot; will rather leave the receiver &quot;extremely pleased&quot; for two reasons.<br />One is this year's fifth disk is not a solid documentary, but a program-length commercial for the consumer products of the WETA workshop.  A very informative, well-produced program-length commercial, but a commercial nonetheless.<br />Two is the movie itself.  A small minority of the scenes added to this extended edition are padding.  However, it is like the extended edition of FOTR an improvement over the theatrical version.<br />The main attraction of this gift-set is the sculpture of &quot;Smeagol.&quot;  The figurine remains like its predecessors,  living-room quality.  It is much larger than the pair provided with the FOTR.  They are making the twin &quot;Gollum&quot; statue available to buyers of this package for about $80.  How equitable this trade-off might be, I leave to you to decide.<br />The packaging for this release in the trilogy remains first-rate.  It is beautiful to look at, and is solidly packed.  So solidly packed, I had to destroy it to get to the materials.  A demerit for those hoping to preserve it for their collection.<br />Again, this is well worth the investment, only in comparison to its predecessor does it fall short.<br />All reports are that the &quot;Return of the King&quot; is the best of the trilogy.  Here's hoping the gift-set is the same.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a great DVD with alot of country-rockin licks and vocals. Well worth your cash to purchase.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Everybody is talking in the reviews about Gambit and Beast having Cameos in this film. Can someone please include in there review where these small cameos can be seen. Great movie by the way.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This new DVD, UP! is one you will watch again and again. Shania's stage presence and vocal skills make this DVD one you will watch again and again. YOu'll be glad you bought this one.
B00001U0DP|2.0|After skimming the reviews here, Roberto Benigni has obviously struck a chord with a lot of people.<br />I would not argue with them but I found myself with the reviewer who called this film MR. BEAN GOES TO AUSCHWITZ.  Actual history proved just too distracting for me to get caught up in this \\"fable.\\"<br />Actually, the film I kept thinking of has never been seen: Jerry Lewis' THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED.  I've read the script and I can only imagine the reviews of that film if it was ever released!  (Now there's a film in itself: a daffy but deranged filmmaker, popping pills and performing pratfalls, producing his movie about a German clown entertaining Jewish kids on their way to the ovens.  Yikes.)<br />LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't go that far, but I found myself constantly distracted by Benigni's rubbery slapstick taking place in a concentration camp.  Yeah, it's sweet that he wants to spare his son the horrors of the camp...but they're in a camp, a concentration camp.<br />The first half of the film actually plays like a whimsical, slightly-more-witty Jerry Lewis movie.  Then the Nazis arrive.  Individual scenes manage to touch and charm, but overall it just feels very odd.<br />Jerry Lewis must have gone nuts when Benigni won the Best Actor Academy Award (William Goldman, the sage of screenwriters, certainly did in print by saying this was the greatest Oscar abomination since THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH won Best Picture in the 1950s).  I admit I was put off at Benigni's antics at the Oscars--\\"I LUFF YOU, I LUFF YOU ALL, I MAKE LUFF TO YOU ALL!\\"  I can't even picture Jerry Lewis carrying on that much if he'd won Best Actor for THE BELLBOY.  Now that I think about it, maybe he would....<br />Yes, movies are a great escape from reality--but there are some realities that shouldn't be part of that escape.<br />We have new generations of kids coming up who are quite removed from the terrifying reality of the Holocaust and the near-slapstick version of it portrayed in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL could diminish the true horror of it.<br />That heaviness, that memory, made buying into the humor nearly impossible.in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL could diminish the true horror of it.<BR>That heaviness, that memory, made buying into the humor nearly impossible.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania shines in her new CD titled UP! I highly reccomend this cd for any shania fan. Taped live in Chicago and outside as well, Shania holds her own on this rocking CD where she covers all her hits in ballands and fun sing along songs. Its a must!
B000069AUI|5.0|As you browse the slew of reviews that litter Coldplay's resume, you are going to see the 5-star reviews and the 1-star reviews.  The 1-star reviews all seem to have the same attitude: &quot;This cd sucks; it's slow, boring, repetitive, I don't get it, it's not melodic, so go buy Radiohead.&quot;  First of all, the requirements they state that create a good song are only their opinions.  Since when does something have to be as melodic as &quot;OK Computer&quot; just to be good?  Even Radiohead's post-OK Computer work is less melodic.  And yes, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is slow, but that's something that makes it SO GOOD!  And repetition can sometimes be a negative thing, but Coldplay uses it to their advantage on this one.  The repetitious drum beats and loud, wailing guitars create an engrossing wall of sound like no other band.  But with contemporary style.  No, this isn't My Bloody Valentine or any of the underground favorites.  There is no reverb-soaked, overdriven guitars here.  There is no excess of effects.  This is not a concept album.  It is not as accessible and personal as &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  It is fine songwriting at its best.  Think Interpol with a dash of contemporary songwriting such as Elton John and a touch of loud, growing rhythms found in classical music.  If you think of the guitars as a symphonic section, you can hear it.  And if you open your mind, you will behold some of the most beautiful rock ever written.
B0000TB03W|5.0|&quot;It'll get you good&quot;. A must have in any Shania fan's stocking.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|A movie like this is another example of why second parts shouldn't be made. All the innovation, freshness, and smart film making of the original Matrix is gone here. The Wachowski Brothers (Larry and Andy), had all the money they could ask to do The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, this was the first mistake. Why? Simple, so much money atrophies the brain, imagination is the most important thing in writing any story, and so it is indispensable for script writing, and most important, in writing any smart script for a much anticipated sequel, what the brothers end up doing is a series of fights tie up with something resembling a script, or should I say, an script essay. The Matrix outstanding original story line was something that couldn't be surpassed so easily, such a problem required hard thinking and commitment, and most importantly, approaching the script with a new and different perspective in order to write not a more original story, but a intelligent one, they miss this big time, instead they delivered what pop culture movies care the most, Action Sequences, its all down hill from here, good scripts are essentially important in film making, if you don't have a good story to tell, having good actors, accurate direction, and great visual effects won't safe your movie. <BR>In fact, every thing goes right until the characters open their mouth to say sh.... The Morpheus Zion speech is the lowest point of 2003 movie season (and I haven't yet seen Legally Blonde II, and I won't intend to). This is particularly sad because Morpheus was the most interesting character in the first Matrix, but in Reloaded he is  ridiculous (I don't understand how the directors wrote this atrocity and manage to write the Architect's speech, a fairly goof piece of writing). In the first film, the actors were acceptably fit in their characters (don't get me wrong, there was no Shakespearian acting in The Matrix), here they are unexpressive masks, and where are the nude scenes with Monica Bellucci (Persephone), the ones that really mattered, huh? (Monica is one of my favorite actresses), instead you get flat Carrie Ann Moss in some mindless boring nude scenes inserted somewhere in a Rave Party (shame on the editor, that scene will cost you the Oscar, Zach Staenberg). <BR>About the action scenes, yes, they are great, Yuen Wo Ping came back for Reloaded and Revolutions, again his work is excellent (as always), the Smith's fight with Neo, and the car chase scene are really good, but you will find your self thinking: this is great, but I don't feel anything, this is because of the lack of story and the zero characters. Every time Neo is flying, you know he will safe, so there is no emotion attached for the characters been harm, and when Trinity is about to die, well, bet with some fool about is she going to die or not?, that way you will get back the money you paid to see this piece of sh... (the Merovingian's Castle fight can cause you a coma, so be prepared).<BR>John Gaeta (the Gaeta Force), commands a great visual effects work, but it repeats itself (hardly there is anything new, only an enhanced Bullet Time technique). The cheap philosophy here is blown up an exercise to impress the audiences,  trying at the same time to bring their film to some intellectual level, not happening here of course. Don Davis improved his music for Reloaded, but the choices for the songs are unfortunate. The direction is O.K (I guess), in terms of the pace, the ending, Why?, To be continued? (see how money atrophies the brain). So if you are Larry Wachowski saying: Woooooowwwww man, I dare anyone, this is like the most com-complex movie ever, you better think again. I did laughed at the Merovingian's Wiping you're a... with silk line, that was a high point of the movie (how sad is that). Fortunately, the Matrix Revolutions has a little something more than Reloaded, so watch it anyway, even with the bad taste of the this film .<BR>To finish with, the DVD (being this a big studio movie), has a lot of really good extras, the sound is great (Dolby Digital 5.1),  the transfer is first class, but this only enhances the DVD value, not the movie quality. The choice here is to rent or buy the Animatrix, you will be more pleased.
B0000TB03W|5.0|After a brief hiatus of creating a family and working on new songs with her ellusive husband, Mutt, Shania has come back strong,both vocally and lyrically. And she hasn't skimped on the entertainment factor either. In fact, Shania seems to be almost basking in her newfound live show lights on this DVD, titled, UP! Respectively so titled UP! with it's upbeat attitude it certainly reflects on the listener/viewer as well. Watch and your attitude will be uplifted too. Enjoy!!
0062502182|5.0|The boy in this book did amazing things to achieve what he wanted. He was just as I wrote before: brave, patient, and loving in his quest to reach his goal. The entire journey was breathtaking and unbelieveable, and if it was real and if it was me, I would have said forget it. Who needs to go through all that? But he kept on, the boy kept going, and at the end, it wasn't easy then either. But he did it.This novel is amazing! I absolutely loved it. Paulo Coelho has gained another fan. Brilliant work. Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;he never called again.&quot;
B000005JA8|5.0|I've never Seen such venomous and scathing remarks over a piece of music. So people don't like it, well too f...ing bad! Your mostly lame insight into this man's music is what's laughable. WHY would people be angry and confused after hearing this when Don's music is known to be extremely difficult for people with no minds. Yes, no clear thinking minds. To be so hyper critical of this, to Such a Degree that it borders on foolish remarks such as, inept musicians, Don's not being a good writer of lyrics (people, Get a LIFE!!, this man played with words as few of you critics could even Begin to decifer) unoriginal, etc... The Anger that pours forth from dozens of these so called musically inclined people is stupendous. This recording incited This Kind of \\"anger\\" in these people? I Fail to Understand this. If I don't like something musically I move on. I may be cross with it BUT the reviews of this are so mean spirited, so totally out in left field as to the validity of their Hatred for it. Their reasoning is.......... For the most part.........is totally simplistic. <br />As for this opus. In my opinon it's not the best thing He's done. It's also certainly NOT the place to start with Don's music. A perfect foil to turning onto this man's genius would be \\"Safe as Milk\\" or \\"Ice Cream for Crow\\" or even <BR>\\"The Mirror Man Sessions\\" His music is an acquired taste. We have people who adore this album. I can relate to this for my love of this man's music resides in it's Kindness, it's sensitivity to the animal, To woman, to the children of the world, Man's wanton desire to destroy and to conquer, Man's ego, Man's greed........What don wrote in such bizarre time signatures will come across for dozens of generations because of an underlying truth that pervades from within it. To deny his genius is in this regard, is simply foolish at best. The sad part of all of this is that thinking men and women, after being turned onto TMR first, before anything else by Don, no desire to hear any of the rest of his catalog will be put forth. THIS is a Shame. A crying shame. <br />I find this album very satisfying in small doses. Of Course,This thing makes \\"Shiny Beast\\" seem semi normal. Very normal. Because of the bizarreness of what is laid out for the listener in these 78 minutes, we seem to recoil if we listen to it all at one sitting. Don't. Take it in 3-5 song pieces. You Cant Follow \\"China Pig\\" with \\"My Human gets me Blues\\" I cant anyway. It's just too intense.<br />This wasn't a bad joke perpetrated on the buying public as so many of these short sighted people will tell you. Think about this. WHY do we see well over 200 reviews here on this single album? SMILE THINK for yourself. Don't rely on so called reviews. For us few, the Beef heart fanatic's, yes, we are biased, we \\"feel\\" this way for good reason. We have been deeply touched by this man's music. My introduction to this man was a cd called \\"Dust Sucker\\" A hodge podge of really lousy out takes for the most part. Something deep inside of me was stirred. The sub par sound didn't matter. I was hooked!! Am I biased? This man Touches my mind, my \\"heart\\"and deep into my very core as a human being when I listen to him. For him not to be taken seriously by some so called music people......................................don't buy into it. <br />Thank you Mr. Vliet. Thank You for having the courage to truly go your Own way musically and by the way. A thing He did called \\"Unconditionally Guaranteed\\" was Not a sell out. Don was madly in love when He wrote that. You want to Talk about Courage and ones convictions?? THAT took courage. Love coupled with genius can do that to a man. It is loosely said that Frank Zappa embodied musical genius. If this is true then Don cant even be quantified as to What He did for his music. He ALWAYS remained True to it. &quot;Always.&quot; Frank on the other hand...........now that's another story.
0440180295|3.0|Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is not one of my favorite books. This is the only book by Kurt that I have read. Slaughterhouse Five was very confusing and hard to follow. The structure of the novel is totally unconventional and does not really have a clear beginning, middle and end.  The main character in this book is Billy Pilgrim, who is able to time travel. One minute you are in present time and the next you are back in World War Two with no notice at all. Besides that total lack of a time unity, there is no unity of place. The setting jumps rapidly and repeatedly between war and the planet Trafalmadore. These are reasons that the book was hard to follow. Also, the fact he was abducted by aliens seem ridiculous to me. A large part of this book is in third person; there is also first person narration in the first chapter when Vonnegut enters the novel as commentator/character. He is present in the first and tenth chapter. This switch of narration further adds to the confusion. <BR>     The one thing I liked about this book was the fact it didn't glorify war. It told what I think are true stores from World War Two. It told the sad truth of war, the things that go on and never are talked about.  A major focus of the book is on the horror of the bombing of Dresden. This event is first described in the opening chapter, although details are found throughout the book. This book is truly an anti-war book.
B00005QCYD|3.0|How do you top two blockbuster predecessors, both related to formidable dinosaurs, in its third sequel? The answer: you don't.<br />Although the plot was rather vague and ambiguous, the special effects, sound, cinematography were quite weak, as expected. I don't think anyone expected the same thrill they received when they saw the original Jurassic Park.<br />During most of the scenes, it felt as though the screen writers decided to make a movie about dinosaurs chasing people, trying to kill them. If there was an excuse to bring the dinosaurs close to people, such an action was always followed. This was strange.<br />Also, considering the quickness of the movie -- roughly 90 minutes -- it felt as though the movie was rushed. Thus, it fueled the belief, even more, that this movie had no plot and a hurried atmosphere. It was okay. This was certainly not a great film.
B000088E6D|5.0|The heavens have been good to us once again and have sent us Michael Buble. For those out there who wish to hear a new spin on some old classics and done with style, you need to check out this cd. His voice is pure heaven on earth.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Just watched this film in the special edition dvd format.  Very cleaned up and well done, but am I mistaken or are there some scenes edited out?  I could be thinking of a different rally, but I thought this film had the famous scene of thousands of torch carrying soldiers forming a giant, rotating swastika  and filmed from above?  It was an incredible scene.  Maybe someone out there can tell me if this was in a different version or just a different rally.   Still, this is worth the high cost of the dvd.
6305949980|5.0|I first saw this movie years ago...and I just love it. I think it is absolutely incredible how the animation is done in the movie. It's astonishing really.<br />I love the storyline and characters. This movie is eye candy for all the senses.<br />The music is fantastic and the sets are sublime. Great movie for the holidays. The artistry in this movie is above anything I have ever seen. Get it.<br />Five out of Five
B00001ODHJ|5.0|Don't let people trick you into thinking this is only something a cult fan could love. If you like horror flicks, this is the pinnacle of the Evil Dead trilogy. Get all 3 movies, and watch the transition from bloody hellish horror to fun family oriented skeleton fighting ala Jason and The Argonauts. The director later went on to make such films as The Sixth Sense, and Signs. This film series is what got him discovered. Get Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2, and Army of Darkness. If you aren't into a bloodfest film, then just get Army of Darkness.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I was wondering how Josh could possibly top his debut album, but HE HAS DONE IT!! Closer is stunning!! I have been playing this non-stop since I got it-- the day it came out. There is only one song that I would have left off the album: 'When You Say You Love Me'. For some reason, that song does nothing for me. ALL of the other tracks are wonderful, especially Mi Mancherai and Per Te. Mi Mancherai is the FIRST MUSICAL PIECE EVER to bring me to tears! The combination of Josh's voice and the brilliant violin work of Joshua Bell is BEAUTY BEYOND WORDS!! Also the diversity of this CD is amazing: Everything from an &quot;Irish gospel&quot; sound (You Raise Me Up) to a song that sounds like something Sting would sing (Never Let Go). I hope Josh writes more songs for his next album, because the three songs on Closer that he co-wrote are outstanding ('Per Te', 'Remember When it Rained', and 'Never Let Go').<br />I would like to clear up something that another reviewer said. The internet version of Closer (that contains 'My December') is NOT available 'only to Grobanites'. ANYONE can order this version by going to JoshGroban.com. It's just not available in stores. I would also HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Limited Edition of Closer (available here at amazon)--the extra cost IS DEFINITELY worth it! The DVD is outstanding, and the track 'Mi Morena' is worth the extra cost alone! Gorgeous! It is unfortunate that this track was not included in the regular version of Closer.<br />Josh Groban is a blessing to the world!
B00008PX8P|3.0|O.K. I finally watched the entire DVD collection. It took me quite some time since there is tons of footage in this. Led Zeppelin's strengths were in my opinion their weaknesses at the same time. They were masters of dynamics, and volume, but used it too much in concert. Some songs were drastically overplayed. Jimmy Page was a perfect rhythm guitarist, and that's what made their songs great, but his leads were pretty bad. They were memorable in composition, but sloppy in execution. It was cool to see how they transitioned from an early blues-based rock band, to a hard rock band, to an almost 80's pop band. That being said, here are my + & - comments.<br />+ Great concert footage, excellent sound & video<BR>+ Great overall band, definitely one of the best ever<BR>+ Great songs, everyone loves radio Led Zeppelin<br />- Several songs show up on this DVD multiple times<BR>- Several classic songs don't show up at all<BR>- They played the songs Waaayyy too long<BR>- Almost too much material to absorb, less is more<br />The segment I enjoyed most was Madison Square Garden in the mid-70's. They were at their hard rock pinnacle at that point. There were 3 songs straight where I thought they were the best ever, and then it fizzled. The 80's stuff with John Paul Jones on keys got boring. Overall it's worth watching, but debatable whether or not you'll want to watch it again. Die hards will love it. Wanna be's will say they love it because it's almost unheard of anyone giving a real take on this group. I like this band a lot, but don't worship them. Jimmy Page to me was the biggest force in the band, yet the weakest link because of his lack of lead guitar prowess. Robert Plant had great tone, but never hit the high notes that were on the records. He floated in the same key range on every song. Bonham was a master drummer, although Moby Dick was too long, and got repetitious. He was a better song drummer than a soloist. John Paul Jones was the best player in the lot, and don't think he's ever got the due he deserved by fans or the band. He never missed, play sweet bass lines, and added versatility of keys. The fact they left him out of the re-union was a total diss.

0679428895|3.0|This book is excellent when it comes to the science of the eruption and aqueduct; not so great when it comes to people. As another reviewer mentioned, the characters are two dimensional. The villains are all-evil, (and of course get their comeuppance in suitable fashion). The hero is interesting but a little anachronistic for my taste (in his complete rejection of the religious beliefs of his time; his rejection of philosophers rings more true.)<br />What bothered me most was the unnecessary wallowing in grotesque and ugly imagery, not to do with the eruption, but with the lifestyles of the rich and powerful. It didn't add much depth or insight, and was simply unpleasant to read. It made me nostalgic for old historical epics like Quo Vadis, the Robe, Ben Hur. These writers/directors knew how to make villains without wallowing in ugly details. They also knew how to add depth to their characters. Quo Vadis in particular is a masterpiece.<br />Unlike another reader, I didn't find Exomnious' fate anticlimactic, but actually one of the more interesting moments of the novel. I did, however, have a little trouble with the hero going back to Pompeii during the eruption to rescue his girlfriend, not to mention a few questions about how he did it. Could they have survived, or would the water have been boiling?<br />The final image of the book is impressive, but unsatisfying from the &quot;what happened next&quot; point of view. The story ends abruptly, with the eruption. It could have used an afterword.<br />Bottom line: if you are a fan of this writer, or possibly of Pompeii, you will want this. For fans of historical fiction, I'd say, don't rush out to buy it.
B000002BPS|5.0|Here's the breakdown:<br />1. Disclaimer - The best of the intros in my opinion. 8/10<BR>2. The Meaning of Life - Great song with awesome guitar riffs. 10/10<BR>3. Mota - Funny song! I love it when the guy says &quot;Mota!!!&quot; Nice fast paced song with great lyrics. 10/10<BR>4. Me And My Old Lady - Weird song... I guess it's okay though 8/10<BR>5. Cool To Hate - Great song about a guy who doesn't like anything, and likes that fine. 9/10 <BR>6. Leave It Behind - Nice song with a great melody type thingy. 9/10<br />7. Gone Away - This is the best song on the CD. Great Lyrics with nice drums at the beginning and throughout the song. 10/10<BR>8. I Choose - Another great song this one has excellent guitar riffs and stuff. People who like loud electric guitar songs, will probably like this. 10/10<BR>9. Intermission - A weird and funny song.....that's all really.. 7/10<BR>10. All I Want - Boom!! After that nice quiet intermission, you get this loud song that will wake you up. It's nice and fast paced. With a great guitar riff during the chorus. 10/10<BR>11. Way Down The Line - A great song about growing up like your parents did. 8/10<BR>12. Don't Pick It Up - A funny song that's very poppy (i guess all of their CD's needs at least one poppy song. But their poppy songs are usually funny. 9/10<BR>13. Amazed - Sort of slow, but still great! It has meaningful lyrics and great music. 10/10<BR>14. Change The World - This is a great song to end with Nice and loud. very fast paced and stuff like that. 10/10<br />So for all you punk/offspring lovers, this CD was made for you!!!
0739307894|1.0|Pompei, by Robert Harris, is terrible.  It is written in a childish style like you used to get in the Weekly Reader in third grade. The plot is lighter that pumice. Do you think our hero, Attilius, will live through the eruption, go back to Pompei and find the girl? Do you think Exomnius was on the take and Ampliatus is behind it all?  As soon as you meet these characters it is clear what is going to happen the writing is so bad. I was hoping that our hero would have to solve some intricate math in roman numerals, like in the Da Vinci Code, to add some interest. Don't buy this in hard cover, wait for the comic book. Even Russell Crowe would turn down this movie, the plot it is so dumb.
B000001IPL|5.0|This has to be one of the best CD's ever!!!!<BR>Here's the breakdown:<br />1. Time To Relax - Just an intro to the CD<BR>2. Nitro (Youth Energy) - Great song. Very powerful. 8/10<BR>3. Bad Habit - One of my favorite Offspring songs. This song starts out slow, but in about 30 or so seconds, it gets nice and loud. It's a very funny song about road rage. 10/10<BR>4. Gotta Get Away - Another one of my favorites. I love the Chorus to this song. 9/10<BR>5. Genocide - Yet another one of my favorites!! (this cd is loaded with them) Nice! Great guitar riffs  10/10<BR>6. Something To Believe In - At first I didn't like this song, but now I love it! Very cool song.  9.8/10<BR>7. Come Out And Play - This is the first song that made the offspring famous. It's a sarcastic look on school violence. 10/10<BR>8. Self Esteem - This is an Offspring classic!! Great song indeed! 10/10<BR>9. It'll Be A Long Time - Great song... I know it has a meaning in it somewhere. I love the guitar riffs in this one!! 10/10<BR>10. Killboy Powerhead - This is the only song that i don't like in this album. It's super annoying... all you gotta do is hear it once and then all day it'll get stuck in your head. You'll be trying to do something then all of a sudden you'll be singing &quot;Killboy Powerheeeaaaed&quot; over and over  6/10<BR>11. What Happened To You? - A very funny song... kinda poppy. If you completely hate pop music, you might not like this one. 10/10<BR>12. So Alone - A weird, but powerful song... i kinda like it. 8/10<BR>13. Not The One - Great song with a great meaning. 9/10<BR>14. Smash - A loud &quot;Don't mess with me!!&quot; kinda song. Great lyrics! (After this song ends, keep your CD player running... there's an acoustic version of come out and play about 7 minutes after the song ends. It's great!!) 10/10  <br />So for anyone who likes punk or any offspring fan this is a MUST BUY!!!!!
0316666343|5.0|What happens when I die? What happens to the people around me? What will Heaven be like? Humans have asked themselves these questions for centuries. We have speculated and wondered about what exactly happens as we die, and beyond. <br />So Suzie Salmon (like the fish) is murdered. The book is from her perspective as she explores heaven, and most of all Earth. We see her as she walks the earth watching her family and her murderer. We see her as she looks at her crush, as she tries to contact her family, as she tries so hard to have an impact in where she can no longer be. <br />Sebold carefully penned a beautifully descriptive, yet none-verbose work on how death affects everyone. Her words are simple and light. And for the entire book, I had a very airy and weightless sensation as I watched and saw what Suzie saw. <br />I wondered a lot while reading the book (there's only so much you can do when you can't sleep...) And I have a much broader view of heaven now. If the book teaches you anything, it's to believe in the sprits that one might not see. But that one can most defintely feel.
B0000CFW87|5.0|The headline of my review for this album says it all very quickly. The moment I heard that this was coming out, I almost literally felt my heart give a jump, and that says a lot. This was well worth the wait. That smooth baritone voice has improved with age (even though he's still just 23). This is every bit as good as his first CD, and I will be bold and say that I actually prefer this one to the first one.<br />Oceano- Reminiscent (to me) in spirit to &quot;Alla Luce Del Sole&quot;. This is carried by lovely piano work with drums in places, buoyed by Josh's exquisite singing. This feels to me like a hymn or song of celebration, almost like a song of honor to the ocean, despite it's relatively quick pace.<br />My Confession- I LOVE this. It's my favorite piece on the CD in fact. Heavy on beautiful flamenco guitar, with nicely invigorating soft drums and a touch of gorgeous string work. Someone has tried to shut himself off from the power of love, and now must tell the woman he loves that he can no longer escape the power of the pangs for her that he carries in his heart and soul<br />Mi Mancherai - This is the theme from the movie, Il Postino. I did not see the film, nor do I speak Italian, but I like this song anyway. The combination of Josh's wonderful singing and Joshua Bell's lovely violin work produces a sure-fire winner.<br />Si Volvieras A Mi- This to me is in the same spirit as &quot;Alejate&quot; from his debut CD, but that's NOT a bad thing. It's great in fact, as I love that song too. I guess it's just that to me this one feels different somehow. I really like the melody in this song, and Josh's singing is, as always, first rate.<br />When You Say You Love Me- This one took a bit to grow on me, but it's lovely nonetheless. This is a gorgeous song, with a moving melody and a great set of lyrics. For all of us men out there, this is a song that tells the women in our lives just how much they really mean to us all. A great piece.<br />Per Te - Another beautiful Italian cut. Great job Josh. No matter the language, your voice still touches the heart of all but most jaded of  listeners, and you've certainly touched MY heart with this one.  <br />Al Improviso Amore- I LOVE the string work and the piano interplay with Josh's golden voice in this. The faster pace of this song in relation to the previous two cuts makes for a nice change. This melody and Josh's voice is invigorating to me here. Very invigorating.<br />Broken Vow- Yet another standout. A bitter lament of a love gone sour and the burning need to ask the question &quot;Why?&quot;  Mixed in is the wish that the love once shared could be rekindled in all it's glory and the depths the singer would go to to make that happen if they could do it. For all who know the pain of losing someone they love to another, this strikes a chord.<br />Caruso- I like this song a lot, even though it took awhile to grow on me. That's probably because, in some places, it's sung faster than I've EVER heard Josh sing anything before. Still, it's a great song. The melodies and Josh's voice won me over rather quickly to this piece.<br />Remember When It Rained- Yet another tale of love remembered fondly after having gone sour for one reason or another. This one features lyrics and music written by Josh Groban himself and is very VERY nice indeed.<br />Hymne l'Amour - A very lovely French song. See my comment on languages in my listing for Per Te. Josh can touch a heart and soul, no matter what language he happens to be singing in.<br />You Raise Me Up - I LOVE the emotional feel of this piece. The choir vocals add a great touch. Josh's voice starts gently, as always, and then positively SOARS to reach the heavens. I only WISH this song had more verses to it. Still the melody and feel of the song, to me, make up for its lack of verses. It's still a great piece and  it STILL managed to win me over. It does not detract from my love for the rest of this CD. <br />Never Let Go- A nice closing piece. The appearance of Deep Forest as guests here make this track different, and the most distinct cut on the CD. As always Josh's lovely voice carries it all and makes the piece a gem.<br />All told, Josh Groban has returned, and this CD packs an even stronger punch than his self-titled debut CD &quot;Josh Groban&quot;. I cannot wait to see and hear what the future has in store, both for Josh Groban himself, and for us, all his fans out there. What a GIFT God has given this young man. At 23 years old, he has a dazzlingly bright future, and for all his fans, myself happily and gladly included in their numbers,  it promises to be a great, hopefully MANY-year listening experience. Happy listening to all readers of this review, and God bless you and yours, always and forever. Peace.
0800127862|5.0|This is a resoundingly misunderstood film.  Probably the finest parody ever made of the action genre as a whole; this film mocks the absurd excesses that most summertime action blockbusters indulge in.  The script is clever enough to divide itself between the dark brutality of the real world and the campy superficiality of Hollywood.  It revels in poking fun of the very films that have made Arnold Schwarzenegger (in?)famous.<br /> The world outside the silver screen is filled with stark reminders of how un-Hollywood life is.  There is crime, bullets hurt good people, and extras that are killed have families they've left behind.  Young Danny (Austin O'Brien) loves film more than anything else.  He attempts to put aside the problems of his life in live in the world that Hollywood has created for him.  His favorite indulgence is the Jack Slater series of films.  They star Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title-hero, a cop modeled after the cloned result of Dirty Harry and Rambo.  Slater is a smooth operator who never makes a wrong step and never fails to land on his feet.  He is essentially everything that Danny, and in reality most children, wish they could be.  When he is given a magical movie ticket by Nick the friendly pathetic mildly wise projectionist at his favorite theater, Danny is transported beyond his world into that of his hero, Jack Slater.  He is quickly engulfed in one of the most entertaining action sequences ever put to film.  It is the crystallization of the genre where there is unexplained action and unnecessary and unequal reaction.  A car explodes because another car goes near it.  A would-be assassin is thrown from his perch atop a moving truck into a parked ice-cream truck that then explodes.  A truck explodes in the air for no good reason, and meanwhile, all the women are attractive (by Hollywood standards).  They move from action sequence to action sequence, all of which are completely superfluous and equally delightful.  Anyone who has ever madefun of, or rightly criticized, the films of Jerry Bruckheimer would find this work profoundly amusing.  On screen, Slater and Danny must confront the cycloptic henchman Benedict (Charles Dance) and his benefactor Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) in order to stop a takeover the SoCal black market and to extract revenge for the killing of Slater's favorite second cousin.  This plot of course, is secondary to the parody.  It moves well and revels in its self-justifying fictional world where a cartoon cat can be a cop, because it's normal there.<br /> The other side of the screen is filmed with dim lighting and always hinting at danger beneath the surface.  Danny's mom (Mercedes Ruehl) is a widow who struggles to support her child both materially and emotionally.  She works the unglamorous midnight shift.  Nick is a washed-up never-was who had dreams of another career and justifies compromises he has made to his goals by referring to his job in the manner, &quot;Hey, it's still show business.&quot;  When Slater enters this world, and gets shot, not only do the bullets hit him, but they cause more than flesh wounds.  In the &quot;real world&quot; the on-screen villains can take advantage of corrupt systems to come out on top.<br /> This film parodies not only action heroes and the action genre, but also bad scripts.  Danny knows not only what has already happened in the movie, he can accurately predict the next steps of the transparent plot of the action film he was watching and then participates in.  The film makes groan-inducing puns and points them out.  The film points out how action films sometimes modify classics to fit into modern pop culture.  This movie could have been a bit shorter and could have done without some of the melodrama in the &quot;real&quot; world.  But those are miniscule flaws next to the eminently enjoyable rest of the film.
0962477060|1.0|What is new in this book? Unfortunately, not much. I bought this book from the recommendations on Amazon.com. What I was looking for is a fretboard trainer type of book, which would allow me to learn my fretboard thoroughly (as a type of exercise}. This book does not teach that. From my point of view, it would teach the reader to navigate the fretboard, but without improving your ability to read music and play it on the fretboard (How long can you fake being a musician without reading music?) ...
B00006ZCFH|3.0|Neo-Soul is dead.  <br />This brief epithet is scrawled haphazardly at the bottom right hand cover of Erykah Badu's latest, a concise EP entitled \\"Worldwide Underground\\".  It's a harsh statement and a hard one to hear.  The idea it represents has been on the lips of the music world for more than a year, now: Neo-Soul, 'they' say, has undergone a suicidal nosedive--edged on by its own commercialism.  <br />Erykah Badu has been somewhat of a mother to Neo-Soul: while artists like D'Angelo personified the genre way back in 1995, the average music listener didn't even know what the music was until Miss Badu hit the scene.  So, it's one thing to hear of something like the demise of Neo-Soul from the masses, but another thing entirely to hear of its death from its mother.<br />Indeed, Badu's latest is a reflection of this perceived death.  Badu seems disillusioned and overly nostalgic throughout most of the album.  Both rapping and singing, she praises a long-lost day when Hip Hop was `fly' and the radio `didn't play the same six songs all day.'  The style of its ten songs-especially past track four-is reminiscent of these days.  <br />At the same time, though, this EP is experimental.  Badu searches for the future in the past, but she doesn't even have a vision.  And at times, it works.  For the most part, \\"Worldwide Underground\\" eclipses the `six songs' overplayed on the radio.<br />Still, this is NOT the Erykah of Mama's Gun or even Baduizm.  The haunting storytelling and unique wordplay so effectively displayed in Badu's LPs is absent from this, her current release.  Badu's writer's block is made evident by eleven minute songs (I Want You) primarily featuring three words.  But, the album has it's moments.  Badu's restlessness solidifies into a sort of groove and by the end of the album, things are starting to make sense.  <br />Then again, by the end of the album, everything's over and it's evident this EP is actually an LP that didn't quite materialize.   Erykah Baduis clearly looking for a creative rebirth, but I'm afraid \\"Worldwide Underground\\" isn't it.<br />Three stars.
B000022TSW|1.0|This movie was horrible!  Tasteless humor.  I like the show but the movie sucked.
B000089RVR|5.0|The real magic here is &quot;Don't Leave Home.&quot;  It's a package of songs that are some slow, some fast, and in the end they blend together beautifully.  I'm in a way speechless at how breathtaking it is...so pretty, such pretty sounds, so magical.  Buy this CD.  Every track is a jewel.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is one of  my  favorite  horror movies...I saw  this  in  the  mid  80's  when  I  was  really  young...probably  6  or  7  but  anyways  out  of  any  horror  movie  I  think  I've  watched  this  one  the  most...It  does  have some  tense  scary  moments  but  I  think  the  movie  was  made  to  really shock  you  with  it's  extreme  violence and  gore..and this  movie  is  just  downright  nasty when  it  comes  to  gore...I've  always  liked  the  atmosphere in  this  movie...Alot  of  people  like  the  sequel  better which is  really  the  same  formula  as  the  first (this one) but  this  one  is  hands  down  the  scariest  one  !!!! Defiantely  a  must-see  classic  for  every  horror  fan !
B000000W5P|4.0|This is an extremely solid album.  Lately, I've been coming around to the notion that Charlie Watts might be the focal point of the band.  At the least, the Richards-Watts connection is primary compared with the Richards-Wood guitar combo.  Listen to a CD like 'Some Girls' and the drums are essentially the lead instrument much of the time.
B000068IEU|4.0|This  movie is was  made  to  shock  you  and  it  does...very  violent  and  sick...The  movie  is  pretty  dated  which might turn  some  viewers  off ...Not an  easy  recomendation ...This  plays almost  like  a  snuff  film....In  my eyes  briliant they  really  took  things  to the  limit  making  this  film ...a  cult  classic not  to  mention a  good  dvd !!!
0066214122|5.0|I read Crichton because I believe he excels in writing mystery-thrillers whose plots, to a greater or lesser degree, involve clever and intricate explorations of science and technology. (I have never been tempted to read Disclosure; and have not gotten around to Eaters of the Dead and Congo) If you find science and technology dull and uninteresting, or difficult, you probably won't enjoy this book (Hint: you could enjoy season after season of ER without ever knowing what &quot;CBC&quot; stands for, even though it's in just about every episode; but details of human blood chemistry are essential to Andromeda Strain (and are dutifully explained).<br />If you have not read Crichton before, I would not start with this work; I recommend Andromeda Strain (early work) or Jurassic Park (more recent). And if you've seen the movie versions, you'll find the books really rather different: much richer in detail and substance and sometimes even very different in plot (Andromeda Strain is the only movie version that does real justice to the substance of its book). If you like those books, you'll like this one.<br />For those who have read Crichton, I agree with the other reviewers who find much to enjoy here, but find this book not as successful as the two it most closely resembles: Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, which I also believe are Crichton's best fiction works. The difficulty here is that the underlying science is rather more complex and abstract, which I believe accounts for the more lengthy explanatory &quot;footnotes&quot; that interrupt the narrative flow. I was also a little disappointed in the resolution (but to say exactly why would give too much away). On the other hand, as much as I enjoyed Timeline, I find the action here much more relevant to plot development and less gratuitously cinematic than Timeline. <br />A few comments about some of the criticisms in other reviews:<br />Character development. There is certainly more in his later books than his early ones. Give the guy a break. You want fascinating and original in-depth psychological profiles or brilliant dialogue, read Faulkner or Albee. All we really need is what is essential to the advancement of the plot. <br />Likable characters. Reviewers refer to &quot;the bad guys&quot; and complain of bitchy wives and whiny kids and not caring what happens because they don't like the characters. Sorry to say, but these folks have completely missed the point. There are no &quot;bad guys&quot; in this book; good and evil are not at issue. It is not &quot;about&quot; characters, likable or otherwise. <br />Movie script elements. Compared to Timeline, there just isn't that much in here. Besides, having seen what happens to his books when they get made into movies, who could blame Crichton for sticking in a few movie scenes to start with; he knows much of the plot will get trashed (apparently also true even for Timeline). At least there's no Matricesque kung fu. <br />Originality. There is very little left in the world of art that can be truly original: much time and effort was spent in the 20th century in pursuit of the truly original, but produced little of interest or lasting value. Thus, &quot;arrogant humanity is almost destroyed by monster of its own creation&quot; was already explored by Shelley in Frankenstein and by Crichton in Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. But the theme is a rich and powerful one that is worthy of many different explorations. And a successful formula is always worth repeating; the challenge and interest is in the details. I believe the Crichton formula is a great success and the details of this manifestation sufficiently interesting to justify reading 500 pages. And yes, I look forward to the inevitable movie, even though I know most of the book won't be in it.
630469797X|3.0|I first  seen this  movie  as  a  kid  in  the  early  80's  and  thought  it was good  not  really  one  of  my  favorite  horror  films  but it  was  good!! okay  fast  forward  to  present  time  I  just  rented  this  movie  and  after  seeing  it  again  I  felt  it  looked  rather  cheesy  especially  the  zombies  which  was  wierd  cuz  for  some  reason  I  don't  remember  it  being  like  that...anyways this  movie is held  as   classic  horror  film  in  which  I  agree  ...I  think  if  your  a  younger  viewer   you  will  get  a  kick  out  of  this   like  I  said  now  it (zombies) are  cheesy !!
0385504209|5.0|This is a great book for all the reasons folks have given. But what was attractive to me was that it highlighted what a wierd group the Opus Dei sect really is.  Having known several Opus Dei scholars at universities, the book's depiction of the sect as a secretive, chauvinistic, and highly conservative really struck a chord.  The fact that the Opus Dei propaganda machine is now churning out retorts only helps to increase the book's enjoyment value.  As a Catholic, I certainly didn't feel the book was anti-Catholic. If it is anti anything it is critical of the holier-than-thou nut cases that try to steer the church into their way of thinking. But mainly it's just a good read.
B000069AUI|5.0|Great songs by a great band.  This cd is fabulous, its good to fall asleep to and just to calm you down.  There are no weak songs, and they are all amazing.  This is one of my favorite cd's and I bet that you will love it.  It is like radiohead, but more piano and even calmer.  It is a good buy and it won't get out of the cd player.
B0000057C5|5.0|You read the title, what more should i say?
0679879269|1.0|Mr Pullman has created a truly insideous work that glorifies Satanism and undermines the source of purity in our world.  Unfortunately this book has captured the imagination of many young people who are oblivious to the concepts of worldview and the schemes of a corrupt author.<br />Parents should strongly investigate this series, considering the author himself says that Satan is actually an advocate of wisdom and freedom.
B00009TB5G|4.0|yep here's my 2 cents worth...can't get the darned thing to work. anyone else having this problem? im polling it here : [...] so copy and paste it and go to it
0385504209|5.0|This book has reignited an old flame for reading. This book made me sit back and think about so many things I never thought of before. I too went online to do some research of my own and I couldn't believe what has always been right in front of my eyes. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. I wish there were more books like this one. This was the first book by Dan Brown that I have read. I have since read Angels and Demons which I also recommend highly. I am about to start another one of his books. I can't wait to get started.<br />Buy this book but take warning once you start it you won't be able to put it down.
B00009L1TA|5.0|There is nothing basic about Basic.  I thought this movie was superb; maybe I'm easier to please than a lot of the people who criticize the script because I found this to be one of the most intelligent, mesmerizing, blow-your-mind movies I've ever seen.  It's a rare treat to find a movie that is not completely predictable these days, and Basic takes unpredictability and surprise to unheard of levels.  There was one small aspect of the saga I successfully predicted early on, but the rest of the twists and turns this movie takes had me doing mental gymnastics.  Every time you start to think you've seen at least a shadow of the light, this movie rips the rug back out from under you and plunges you into even darker depths of confusion and doubt.  Best of all, this elaborate plot actually holds together, which is really just amazing.  Basic is a movie that makes you think, and I have no problem admitting that I was often at a loss as to what was really going on; Basic did not insult my intelligence in any way shape or form; it challenged it constantly and delightfully humbled me in the process.<br />At the center of the story is a Special Forces training mission that goes horribly awry.  Only two of six soldiers make it out of the Panamanian jungle, one of whom is injured and the other of whom isn't talking.  The base commander Styles (Timothy Daly) calls in his old buddy Hardy (John Travolta) to interrogate the witness because he feels the job is over the head of Army investigator Osborne (Connie Nielsen).  Before the feds get involved, Styles wants to know why the unit leader Sgt. West (Samuel L. Jackson) and four soldiers are lying dead somewhere out in the jungle.  Hardy is a former Ranger who served under and hated West, but he is now an agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency.  Hardy gets the one soldier to tell his version of events, only to hear a much different story from the injured soldier when he wakes up in the hospital.  So begins a quest for the truth thathas Hardy and Osborne running back and forth between witnesses, discovering unexpected aspects of the case such as the existence of drug-smuggling operations being carried out inside the base and hospital, and discovering that the big fish they are striving so hard to reel in is one big whopper indeed.  <br />Do things become confusing?  That's affirmative, but I see this in a positive light.  This movie makes you stop and think, turning over what you have heard in your own mind not so much to predict the future as to merely stay caught up with the twists and turns you have just seen revealed before your very eyes.  In the final analysis, one or two little aspects of the presentation, which occur largely in the form of dream-like flashbacks, may have a weak leg to stand on but never come close to collapsing or falling over.  Some will probably be tempted to just throw their hands up in the air and give up trying to understand everything, but those who love a challenge, especially one presented in such a theatrical and awe-inspiring way, will find themselves energized and inspired to a degree few movies can hope to duplicate.  For my money, Basic is one of the most intelligent, suspenseful thrillers I've seen in a long time.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Brit, or I should say Brit's controllers have produced a new set of carefully crafted pop music for the masses. Oh Boy, regurgitated music! I can't believe that people would even consider buying this stuff but you can sell anything if you hype it enough; and that's what B.S. has been doing. <br />Its still the same old \\"look at me I'm sexy\\" stuff put into a new box, but then again, what else can B.S. do? Does she have any real talent besides prancing around in a tube top? Of course not. Someday soon, people will wake up and stop buying this, then maybe some real music will be heard on top 40 radio..
B0000DJZA5|2.0|What a disappointment! [...]  Having been treated to the original when it came out, being a modest musician myself, I was taken with the original album's line-up of the songs and all the studio chatter to boot. And here's why: the \\"Let It Be\\" filmed project was an exercise to show the band in it's stripped down state in the studio creating from begining to end an album. The film recorded the band live and as such the original LP remains the true soundtrack to the film's tone. To hear them \\"IN-STUDIO\\" bantering and working out the songs is important to the \\"mission statement\\" of the project and often down right fun, if not insightful.  The L.I.B.N. release strips not only Spector's \\"Wall of Sound\\" additions but also the unique experience of hearing the band at work in the studio and live on the roof atmosphere which must necessarily include the chatter and short musical snippets like \\"Maggie Mae\\".  Also, as others have stated in their reviews, the stripped down treatment of the few Spectorized tunes have already been heard and the \\"bonus CD\\" is a waste.   Then again, the \\"bonus CD\\" would be excellent to take along with the original \\"Let It Be\\", entertwining the two(along with the songs from L.I.B.N.)to create something more like what we should have been given, a live in-the-studio-jamming/creating look at a band and individuals the likes of which will never be seen again.   And, again, as others have said, the length of space a CD is capable of taking should have afforded the opportunity for a much more involved and illuminating product. This should have been at least a two CD project in the way described in the previous paragraph if not a three or four CD result, given the massive material recorded during the \\"Get Back\\" sessions.  If you want to hear the \\"Get Back\\" sessions as REALLY intended, the intimate live look at the creative effort from begining to end, then take all the recordings available(from the original LP, the Anthology, etc.)from these sessions, including the \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" and assemble them in a progressive chronological manner on three or four burned CDs, winding up with the \\"clean\\" versions of L.I.B.N.  Then, you will have what was originally(along with the film)intended.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This cd is so good. The way she sings her songs touches me. The This cd is so good. The way she sings her songs touches me. The song choices are good. She has not lost her voice, it has changed but for the good. The deepness, the soulfulness, it's just all there. This is a cd for the ages.<br />First Noel- Beautiful arranged song. Her voice is so clear on here. Excellent production. She hits some lovely notes in this song.<br />Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting is what us black folks know it as lol)- Very good rendition of the song. She sounds very pretty and her voice floats over the track.  <br />Little Drummer Boy- This song feat. Whitney's daughter and she sings very well. This song is a melodious take, Whitney sounds good with the drum sounds she makes at the end.<br />One Wish- My new holiday favorite! This is a new classic written by Whitney and Mervyn somebody lol this song is so good. <br />O Holy Night- An awe-inspiring song. She really takes the songs to another level.<br />I'll Be Home For Christmas- A bluesy Christmas love promise. She sounds very much suited for the song. She makes her voice do this weird adlib at the end.<br />Deck the Halls/Silent Night- Funky medley of two songs. She sounds so gospel-influenced on this song. This is one of my favorites.<br />Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas- really nice song. She does this really cool adlib after she hits high note which reminds me of the gospel great Kim Burrell.<br />O Come, O Come Emmanuel- You feel spiritual when you hear this song. She really ministers the words with her voice. I love her voice at the end.<br />Who Would Imagine A King- Song off the Preachers wife soundtrack redone...love this version. <br />Joy To The World- Also off the Preachers wife redone...amazing song with choir.<br />This album was great! My only regrets were that it left me wanting more tracks. Butall in all this is a cd you won't want to miss. Long Live Whitney!
B000002IG4|4.0|The Amazon.com review of the record notes that Phil mentions the target of his lyrical ire by name -- Jill. It's a minor point, but facts is facts, brother. The woman he just divorced was Andrea. Jill was his new love. If you want to hear the songs about his breakup with Jill, you've gotta buy Phil's Both Sides CD.
B000005PW0|5.0|Well well, where does a Guttenberg good guy like me start. Guess I should stat at the Turner family compond back in the winter of 87. That is the time and the place where I first saw this film and were my love of all things Police Acadamy and Stevie Guttenberg started.I do declare that I howled and howled with laughter as the comical plot unfolded in front of my water drenched eyes reaching the stunning riot finale. Since that day I have been forever touched by Police Acadamy and left with the view that Police Acadamy was and still is an overlooked American comedy classic. Lets start then by talking about Stevie Guttenberg's undoubted comic acting abilities.<br /> Indeed I first think we should be talking and thinking about Guttenberg with the likes of Ted Danson & Pee Wee Herman in mind. We need to place Guttenberg on a comic plinth, to establish his comic postion within the halls of the great Hollywood tradition of Slapstick comics. If you look at the rest of the Acadamy trilogy, the pictures Guttenberg did not star in are noticable worse and I mean noticable. Of course they still have the gags that you want and some of the characters you want but the films do need Guttenberg's comic quips and timing to bring the sequels in line with the first installment .Theres just something about Guttenbergs charm and confidence that as ive spoken about earlier I liken to  the great Ron Howard and like Howard's Richie Cuningham, Guttenberg makes the Mahoney role his own with a combination of style and slap stick nonsense. Oh yes I did say nonsense and theres plenty of that too. <br />So what about the film I hear you wannabee Guttenbergs cheer? Well As a kid I really connected with the childish, toilet humour that is the backbone of this great movie and the whole of the trilogy.The film contains so many references be it sexual or personal and so many in jokes that there really seems to be a laugh a minute. remeber all this is good, harmless humour. Classic gags and scenes suchas Captin Harris going head first at great speed into a Horses rear is funny but not offensive. Its childish, stupid and mind numing comedy but it is comedy and bloody good it is too.<br />Of course all things had to come too an end and Hollywood in there great wisdom made alot of sub rate Police Acadamy's in the years following the critical and commercial success of the Original.Fear not though theres still the original & I plead with all of you comic lovers out there in the big wide world to got THIS BOUGHT. Nuff Said
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I was anticipating this album along with new albums by Deep Purple (Bananas) and Cheap Trick (Special One). My three favorite bands all with new albums in the same year. Yeah!<BR>Cheap Trick was first and was a big let down, with only a few good songs and sub-par production. Deep Purple's was a pleasant surprise, a 51 minute album that never dropped the baton, from start to finish, amazing music making and wonderful production. <BR>Now comes Say You Will by Fleetwood Mac and it's almost as enjoyable as Purple's but Mac drop that baton a couple times, and perhaps that's to be expected when it's almost an 80 minute album. The production is solid, perhaps too much mid range, but it isn't quite as clean as Bananas (Deep Purple), but it's clearly better than Special One (Cheap Trick). It's great to have legendary bands still trying to make &quot;good&quot; music and not rest on their laurels.<br />5 stars: Bananas<BR>4 2/3 stars: Say You Will<BR>2 1/2 stars: Special One
B00006BSGZ|5.0|It's the TOSCA segment that surpasses everything!  Besides the superlative vocal aspect - it is her incredible acting that impresses ...... before the 'murder' - the partaking of a goblet of wine - just to 'calm' the nerves - then realizing that the alcohol is taking effect [stress?] she puts her hand over the glass - fingers twitch nervously ... etc. etc.  GREAT subtext!<br /> .... confused?<br />No, no - this rare example of Callas skills as a talented actress is not to be missed - often imitated - the original is the one to see.<br />Pity so little is left though.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The music of the Rings' Trilogy has been as powerful as the beautiful scripted and and acted film.  Without their grace, force and darkness, the films would have been weakened.  Shore once again creates a distinct over all mood for the score, yet has the thread of the first two films interwoven.  Amazing when you listen to all three scores together.  How they all work and compliment the other, but have their own entity.<br />The music is provocative, awe-inspiring, beautiful.  And Annie Lennox's closing theme \\"Into the West\\" sets the perfect closing note.<br />Super job!<br />Also inluded is a double sided collected trading card, nice little treat.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien \\"Quadrilogy\\" is without a doubt the most comprehensive DVD collection to date.  I don't generally buy DVDs for the extras, but I was quite impressed with the sheer quantity of supplemental material featured herein (more than I'll ever be able to watch, even if I were so inclined).  Less impressive - maddening, really - is the fact that no one involved with the production of this outstanding set of discs realized that \\"quadrilogy\\" is not a word.  It's \\"tetralogy,\\" folks.  Basic English.  Sheesh.
0385504209|1.0|As a Bible teacher in Catholic and mainline Protestant churches and author of several books on the Bible, I get many questions about this book, so I had to read it.<br />All I can say is that one must remember that it is a work of FICTION. Any resemblance between actual history, whether of the church or of Europe, is nearly completely coincidental. The book has major bloopers of &quot;fact&quot; on nearly every page where there is reference beyond the immediate plot.<br />The &quot;repression&quot; of the sacred feminine goes back at least as far as Israel's prophets. The divinity of Jesus was established by the early second century as an article of faith, and has nothing to do with Constantine. The hieros gamos was practiced as a ritual by kings to establish their own royal authority, not by ordinary people. Etc. Etc.<br />Further, I'm surprised so many people find it so well written. The characters are almost identical to many stock thriller books, including, most recently, the popular young adult fiction series, &quot;Artemis Fowl.&quot; The Grail story has been told and retold in countless novels, many better written than this book.<br />There is one way to explain the popularity. In the words of one of the book's characters, &quot;everyone likes a conspiracy.&quot;
B00009TB5G|4.0|Excellent extra footage, but Disc 2 was defective.  The Helms Deep scene did not play properly. I exchanged it for another one, and it was also defective.  The Helms Deep scene played correctly, but I was not able to select the scene from the menu.  Is anyone else getting this problem?
B00009TB5G|5.0|This version, while not as much an improvement as the extended version of Fellowship was, is still vastly improved from the theater cut. With one exception, the extra bits add so much to the story that they alter the story itself in some ways. The additions were things I missed from the original. Scenes made less sense when they were cut; the added pieces that brought out the characters in new and more enlightening ways were put back in. This version is far more true to the story and far less dark in theme.<br />No spoilers, just hints: Now you understand the horse that comes to Aragorn as he lays in the river; the aftermath of the flood of the valley by the ents; more about Frodo and Sam leaving the beseiged city; more about the story behind Faramir, his brother and his father.  Just more, all around.<br />And it's a beautiful case.<br />I suppose the extras are nice too, but all I wanted was the full version of the movie. The other cut is like when you import a movie or TV show to one country from another, and the censors cut pieces out: it just doesn't make as much sense, and it tends to be awkward. This shouldn't be called &quot;extended&quot;, since it seems to be more the way it was meant to be seen.<br />Fair warning: it's split in two (definitely a good thing), since you'll need that potty &amp; snack break.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Perhaps one of the greatest compliments you can pay a band is that they actually influence you to the appreciation of a new genre.  Such is my tribute to this masterful quintet.<br />I've heard metal before and not particularly enjoyed it, however I was hooked on Dream Theater back when they were only known as Majesty, and cassette tapes were the distribution method of choice.  Slowly but surely, as they have experimented into new genreforms, I have been a slow follower.  While Prog Rock is still my comfort-zone, this album has &quot;awake&quot;ned me to a metal genre I'd previously shunned as too harsh and void.<br />While LaBrie's voice isn't the best for this type, you can tell he's worked on &quot;roughing it up&quot; a bit over the past few albums, and the occasional instance where a casual listener might think twice (&quot;was that hetfield?&quot;)... but mostly it's the megaphone/vox processor that aids his transition.<br />Six Degrees (disc 1) sat on my shelf for a good 3-4 months before I listened to it a second time, since then though &quot;the glass prison&quot; (their heaviest song prior to this album) has become one of my more-played songs.... such is the case with Train of Thought... After first listen through, I regressed to the &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;, &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; and even &quot;Six Degrees&quot; (disc 2) for a week or so, but in picking up Train of Thought again -- as usual -- I'm discovering quite a bit with each new listen - both to the impressive musical talent that has always been there, as well as to the undercurrents of &quot;smart&quot; music &amp; lyrics that have always been found with Dream Theater on subsequent listening sessions.<br />Again, not my preference of genre, but when you begin to re-evaluate your outlook on a whole genre due to a single effort, it's gotta count for quite a lot!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater is always moving on and trying to sound fresh and different. Like I read in another review, every time DT has a new record we're always expecting it to be the coolest cd ever. However these guys have the ability to pull off a fantastic record every time they make one. This album is definitely not their best work (and not their worst as has been stated too) but it sure has some great moments and is so reminiscent of records like Awake and the first CD of 6 Degrees...(&quot;This Dying Soul remembers a lot &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;). <BR>Some people have criticized the record because it's so &quot;metal-oriented&quot;, it's very trashy and it has a very rough sound. All I can say is that you're gonna love this album if you like the hardcore part of these guys the most. the record's hard sound is constant and there's only a very little breathe with the track &quot;Vacant&quot; which is a nice little balad(less than 3 minutes long) and the flow sets on again with the powerful instrumental &quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot;. Between the crunching guitar riffs, the thunderous drums and the powerful bass lines if you have the time to really listen, you can discover very melodic songs. The record is over 70 minutes long and I feel it feels short anyway. Don't waste another minute and go buy this (but don't expect their best work ever).
B000002HK4|5.0|This is such a poetic escapade that one could hardly believe the &quot;circle of life&quot; style lyric would fit appropriately into this genre.<br />While John Petrucci is my favorite lyricist overall, Mike Portnoy holds the single-song best lyric honor with this one.<br />&quot;Ear Candy&quot; is the best description here: lyrically and musically, this 20+ minute epic paints true imagery set to motion by the cadence and progression of the music.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|First off I admit I have never been a fan of Britney, the person, I do, however, like SOME of her songs. I've always considered Britney as a mediocre singer (notice how 99% of her songs rely on background vocals) but the rythm of certain songs is pretty catchy.  In IN THE ZONE, Brit finally leaves behind her pretend virginal image and her bubble gum, corny songs to give us a more mature sounding album (except for track #2, I like all the other songs). However, one thing that you will notice is that you can barely listen to Britney's voice!!!! ALL of the tracks rely on heavy background singers and overlayering. If you dont mind that, I think that it is a pretty decent album, pretty decent music and lyrics but one thing is for sure...she will NEVER be Madonna.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|well, i was never a big tool fan, and i didnt ever listen to mer de noms.  so i heard weak and powerless.  it was a great track.  the words had a lot of meaning to me.  not to mention the drums, the drumming is incredible, and the bass, and then the guitar come together perfectly.  <br />now my favorite track is &quot;halo down&quot;.  that is a great song.  i really cant get over the drumming.  it is so tight and impeccable.<br />the only thing i have a hard time with is the bleak subject matter of the lyrics.  it does wear on me listening to the dark and deep struggles of drug addiction that tend to piece the tracks together.  i have been there so i get it.  it isnt a pleasant place to go....  i guess someone has a serious drug issues in the band..???<br />sometimes i think the record would be great in an instrumental version as well.  dont get me wrong the lyrics are great, but sometimes they are too close to home if you know what i mean. <br />they could write incredible soundtracks...
B000066NW0|5.0|I have no idea whether she wrote the lyrics, or whether she plays the guitar but one thing for sure is this CD can never ever be a waste of money<BR>It's the best lyrics teens can relate to, she's got a great voice and amazing tunes and she's my 2nd favourite singer!! (1st is Britney and ppl hate her 150 times more than Avril which is so sad so this is no biggie about crummy ppl writing hate reviews)<BR>All the songs are fantastic and I can't dream of anyone not liking the CD. I bet the ppl writing hate reviews here are just damn jealous of her. <BR>THIS CD IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY. BUY IT TODAY...BUY IT...BUY IT (I'm hypnotising you..kidding!)

B00006CXXU|5.0|Just WOW...This girl is beyond talented...She wrote most of the songs, she sings her heart out...she's just amazing. I can't believe this girl was once part of the buuble gum pop phenomena, and was actually compared to likes of Britney Spears...Seriously ppl, listen to this album and u'll see what an amazing artist she has become...Walk Away, Impossible. Beautiful, and I'm OK are masterpieces...The rest are awesome, but these songs will leave u speechless.
B0000DC13U|3.0|Were we, the members of the &quot;Woodstock Generation&quot; really that STUPID, taking this &quot;revolution&quot; stuff literally?  OK, were it not for the fact that Jean-Luc Goddard, the director of this thing, seemed hell-bent on inflicting footage of...I guess...&quot;the upcoming revolution&quot; or something, this would be fantastic.  It's interesting to watch the Stones take their own sweet time, create the song.  Initially, there's Mick, Keef, Brian (!), &amp; Charlie doing a &quot;well, we CERTAINLY don't have THIS together&quot; version, with sideburned Nicky Hopkins trying to lay an organ part on what he hears.  And, again, try to tune out the &quot;revolutionary&quot; segments, because the movie just keeps getting more and more interesting.  There's Keef, swapping off with Bill, laying down a bass pattern; Brain finally getting so out of it that someone has to light his cigarette for him; both Keef and Mick are QUITE...&quot;primed,&quot; you can almost smell the exotic tobacco in the studio.  I have been told there there is a version of this movie available somewhere with the completed song, I haven't seen it.  But I do enjoy watching Mick doing his &quot;electric rooster&quot; routine while laying down the vocal track, and right behind the sound-baffle, Keef and Anita (VERY much together), and a host of others are doing the OOH-OOH background vocals.  Try to do the impossible and tune out the liberal gibberish.  You'll be rewarded seeing the Stones create one of their very greatest songs.  And let me know if you can get hold of the copy with the completed song.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|I hardly know another album of that quality regarding the fact that these are &quot;only&quot; outtakes and B-sites etc. BTW I like both Nirvana &amp; Pearl Jam, I have absolutely no problem with that.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I heard the first five or so songs on this CD when a friend had just gotten it. We didn't even finish a song before it became either disgusting or just plain bad. I know that this is definitely not the worst music around when it comes to content and lanuage but I will have to say Ms. Spears has sunk to an all time low. Half the CD is loud music and sound effects that drown out any real singing. Another person with potential has wasted the gift. Don't waste your money and time!
B000089RVX|5.0|I have fallen for Evanescence. This is one of the best CD's ever! I love Amy Lee's voice. I really can't pick a favorite from the CD. They are all good at stand for themselves. I also suggest to buy the &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; single and hear &quot;Farther Away&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot;.  These two were missing from the Fallen CD, but they are well worth the price of the single.
B00005LOUQ|2.0|I think the How the Grinch Stole X-mas was an exceptionally good movie.I think alot of it is histarical and I laugh alot during it. Except there is one part(which I really don't care to mention I think brings it down one star),but if you just FF it it's really a very funny and great movie!!!!!
B000077VPU|1.0|Well, I bought it and returned it when I found out that they had edited the first half of the concert.  I had the original taped from MTV back in 92 and lost it but then I purchased the VHS which to my disappointment had Bob Geldof &amp; Spinal Tap removed among other things. Which is still not as bad as this DVD - Somebody please release the whole thing!! Thank You
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is an extremely under rated film. The vampire and lycan (werewolf) cultures are depicted quite accuratley, Kate Beckinsale is amazing!<br />Its also very refreshing to hear Maynard's (lead singer from A Perfect Circle/Tool) voice in a film again (last time was in Escape From LA, to the tool tune \\"Sweat)<br />Very good story, action, and a love story<br />Great movie
B00008RV1L|5.0|Based on the Bret Ellison book by the same name, this movie is actually better than the book. The problem with the book was that it became too descriptive of every product's brand name that it was hard too concentrate on what was actually going on, even though it tried to make a good point of how ridiculous commercialism was. The director even said that her film edited the book down, that's a good thing in this case.<br />American Pyscho is a social satire film, exposing the hidden misery of a man that seems to have all a guy could ask for, good looks and money. Christain Bale gets the essence of his character, Patrick Bateman a rich man who really is a nobody that no one would honestly care for (one guy kept thinking he was someone else which drove him crazy). Bale acts like a big shot business man then a maniac the next. He secretly hates everyone he knows, is obsessed with sex and kills people. All this is a criticism of the lifestyles of a business man in the 80's, it criticizes the music of that time as well. Bateman would rant about pop music he was playing while he killed someone, the comedic factor of the film.<br />The violence is toned down, you'll just see splashes of blood go around and cuts on people but they do show a lot of nudity. Bale was chasing a girl with a chainsaw while he was naked and there was one scene where he had two 'escorts', it's not pornographic.<br />You'll learn something from this movie, you should value your sanity more than your money.

B00005JKC3|1.0|I was honestly looking for a good time with a complex story about a man torn apart going through struggles but thats not what I got from the Hulk. All there really was was a string of tedious conversations with weak dialouge. All Betty (Jenifer) did was cry in each scene and the movie expects people to feel drama on cue. I'm not that touched easily.<br />Weak story, a bit of an overkill too. Was not at all neccesary to go on mindless rambles just to explain Banner's father was abusive and his love interest is the daughter of an army general. I got the point and the movie just stretched and kept on riding on those facts throughout the film to look more &quot;epic&quot;. It was a big filibuster, so much unemotional talking that it became pointless to even show comapsion for any of the characters.<br />No, I'm not one of those airhead action movie junkies, if that's an impression you get from any one that dislikes the Hulk. People infered I was just dissapointed with the film because of the lack of action but that is not the case with me. I even hate action movies because they're so pointless and all they do is have dumb big explosions that only impress elemtary school kids. I love dramatic emotional stories with complex characters as long as they are done right and is enlightening. I believe movies that are to be taken seriously should teach you something instead of just dwelling on emotion because what is the point of indulging in sadness?...nothing of course.<br />I'm a fan of the early Bruce Jones Hulk run because of the sophisticated story as well, too bad the sophistication became a drag on screen with the Hulk.<br />I don't mind the origin changes either, even if it was too drastic of a change how the Hulk came to be in the movie. The origin tried to create so many subplots that it became a hassle for the film to explain them all and the subplots were nothing at all interesting to begin with, typical bad science fiction mumbo jumbo.<br />Maybe the origin could have been a lot more tasteful if it was closer to the comic because that was a trademark of who the Hulk was, a product of a bomb explosion.<br />Characters in this film didn't have any depth, they just talked and talked, no change or progression in expression, they were so bland.<br />Filibuster is the word that pops in my head whenever I think of this movie. I wasn't at all impressed either with the fancy comic panel editing, they had better use of comic panel editing in the Setpehn King and George Romero classic, Creepshow, I don't buy into how Ang Lee is all of a sudden a break through director just by making bad use of something you don't see too often in mainstream films.<br />Marvel sure has a big loser here, they thought they'd see the success they saw with Spider-Man again. There were so many products carrying the name Hulk and had his big green clown face but now all those products are in the clearance section rotting.<br />Nick Nolte is a good actor, the same year this movie was out, he had another one that went poorly unnoticed, Northfork. I hear some people praising Hulk as a drama but where are these people when they should be praising Northfork, a movie that is actually a drama done right.<br />But that's just me, I know some enjoyed it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|oh, indie cred dogmatism. that is what has affected the career of the strokes.this might be derivative in the sense that it follows in the tradition of the vu etc. but i don't think i've ever heard music this good even from the velvet underground (gasp!).julian casablancas is a talented singer and the brian wilson of this band i might add. everyone does a wonderful job, blending seemlessly, catchy no-frills rock.is this it is wonderful. it is one of the few albums i can listen to from beginning to end. and hopefully after room on fire their much deserved respect shall come.
B00009W8N2|5.0|For a first album, Opeth had the perfect sound. Not as polished as their newer stuff but still excellent. There is a perfect combination of acoustics and electric guitars working in co-existance.<br />Whenever I pop this CD in my player, I listen from first to last track. It's like watching a movie. I hang on to every instrument and lyric within each song as if I were watching an actual film, minute by minute, second by second. This quality of being like a movie with many different elements of sadness and gloom in the music is what makes this one of my most cherished albums in my collection.<br />Each song is the equivalent of a finley detailed sculpture, every melody and harmony was painstakingly put together with different parts to create long epic songs, every track builds up to burst into something beautiful, out of all their albums, this one is the most progressive musicwise. There's some great solos too, Mikael forgot how to play them though, he said in a guitar.com interview.<br />&quot;The Apostle In Triumph&quot;, is my favorite song from here, it has this killer introduction with an eerie beautiful arrangement of acoustic guitars creating momentum for when the metal interior of the track starts. Then towards the end, there's a violin riff, an interesting experience in the song.<br />I've been listening to progressive metal for years now and Opeth still manages to be one of my favorites, right next to Maudlin of the Well and Dream Theater. And this here, Orchid, is the album that defines what Opeth is best at. Too bad Blackwater Park was the first album of theirs to get some real attention and you don't see Orchid in the mall that often, people don't know what they're missing.
B000065V41|3.0|A full five-stars for the wonderful &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol.&quot;  I am amazed that a fresh and interesting take can be found on the often re-made Charles Dickens's &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;  Muppet movies are hit-or-miss at best, and this one is either the top 1 or 2.<br />Michael Caine is brilliant as Scrooge, and the combination of the completely straight Caine and the antics of the muppets creates a wonderful reality, blending the original ghost story with a heartwarming chaser.<br />The DVD contains two really nice special features, including a very interesting &quot;Making of...&quot; featurette , and a nice &quot;Christmas's Across the World&quot; featurette.  The &quot;Making of....&quot; featurette is one of the most interesting that I have seen, quite long with cast interviews, special effects, song information and pretty much everything you could want.<br />However, several really disappointing choices were made on this DVD release, including producing a full-screen edition and eliminating the song &quot;The Love is Gone&quot; from the UK edition.  When I buy a DVD, I want to full movie, not 75% or it with the edges trimmed off.  Also, the exclusion of &quot;The Love is Gone&quot; from the UK edition makes no sense, as it is singled out to be the most important transition point of the movie during the &quot;Making of...&quot; featurette.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My family and I love this movie.  I suppose some of the other reviewers might say that this shows a lack of intelligence on our part as they apparently felt the movie mindless and trite.  Obviously, I disagree.  I was happy to find a movie that tries to tell young children that there is nothing to fear from \\"monster's\\" or what's in their closet/under their bed.  Aren't those common fears for young children ?  What an inventive way to say it !  My daughter was not scared by any portion of the movie and immediately identified with boo.
B000068PQ0|5.0|A friend got me into the Lips years ago, and honestly I haven't heard them since. Now that I'm more finaancially stable I went back and picked up a few favorites, and decided on this one too. I was not disappointed.<br />It's everything I expected from these psychadelic rockers from OK, and more. The first four tracks could easily be a soundtrack to a movie. The song \\"Do You Realize\\" is inspirational, wise, and beautiful. That song alone made me smile. Very little music can do that. \\"Yoshimi\\" is electronica, it's rock, it's punk, it's everything. I really can't stress how good this release is. I don't know that I'd say it's their best work, but it's up there with their best work.
B00005JM0B|2.0|I'm a fan of T1 and T2 and had to see this one.  The trailer voice over should have began, &quot;In a world of reality TV where viewers find the time to watch girls eat roaches for cash they will certainly find the time for watching T3.&quot;  This was a B movie to be sure and all the other reviews are spot on - John Connor acting/character, no chemistry in the cast, people just going through the motions.  I swear if Clare answered her real life mobile during the chase scene it might have been more interesting.  &quot;Hi Drew, look, move my manny and peddy to 5 after today's shoot...no, I'm just getting thrown around in the back of a Toyota tundra...its kind of stylish...no I'm a Range Rover gal...&quot;  You get the drift. A lot more interesting than &quot;CUT TO  Cars flipping upwards on impact, defying physics through use of digitaly erased cables.&quot; <BR>And, of course, the numerous plotholes.  But as a technotype, I loved suspending my disbelief in the explanations for some of the Sci Fi aspects.  We finally get to see the power source for these &quot;terminators&quot; - that was helpful. But some other technolgies were not even explained in English in order for my disbelief to be suspended.  This brings me to the title of my review. I must have spent 20 minutes going through a 30 second sequence post the chase scene when Ahnold, ahem, I mean, the vintage T-850 Model 101, starts discussing the bells and whistles of his newfangled foe, the T-X, aka Terminatrix, with the premium adjustable rack package. He is talking about her weapons being nanotechnology something or other and then she is protected with &quot;hardened metal&quot; or some such. Due to Ahnold's Austrian accent, which one reviewer suggets was discretionary (probably true) I could not discern what he was saying. Not that it mattered on the surface, but I would wager a fortune that the script had no actual words in it and he just mumbles through it using his accent as a decoy. It was unintelligible.  If there is a reviewer out there that can actually get their paws on the screenplay, please post that scene here or on IMDB to see if it was accurate.  The curiosity is killing me.<BR>As for the ending, I sort of liked it. The fact that it was remotely clever (saying something for this film) almost left me with a better feeling as I hit the eject button on my DVD player.  Thus my extra star.  It would have gotten three stars if there was some nifty nuclear vaporization shots ala the made for TV Cold War chiller &quot;The Day After&quot;.<BR>In terms of quality this seqel ranks above Superman 3 (easy hurdle), totally above Attack of the Clowns, I mean Clones, but ties with Godfather 3 and is no match for Rocky 3 (show of hands here, was Mr. T not the best casting - even he could have played a better John Connor &quot;I pity the fool that provides the source code uplink to let SkyNet become self actualized.&quot;)  But alas, I show my age.<BR>But who are you kidding, you are going to see this movie because you are curious enough to read this far.  Turn your mind off and enjoy.  You work hard, you deserve it.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The first movie was good. This, is the best movie of summer '03. It only gets better from here. Not a dull moment, Magneto and the X-Men on the same team (well, briefly), and Nightcrawler teleporting. I haven't even watched the extras yet, and I've already watched the movie 5 times!<br />Bring on X3!
0804106304|4.0|I thought Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club was a very moving novel. I thought the story of four Chinese mothers and their four Chinese-American daughters was very interesting.  It was amazing how Amy Tan could shift from one story to another all throughout the book without missing a beat.  I would recommend the Joy Luck Club to anybody looking to read a story about a different culture, and overcoming the different culture barrier.
630514415X|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie...i Love it even more...and every time I watch it I find new things i didnt' even see before, new symbolism and special ideas...the ending scene throws me off everytime..i love it!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|GOOD NEWS: This is probably Britney's best album yet.  <br />BAD NEWS: Compared to her other albums, this is not saying MUCH.<br />MORE BAD NEWS: Every song on this album sounds borrowed.  Madonna has done the whole \\"sex\\"/heavy breathing thing a long time ago.  IT GROWS TIRED.  NOTE TO BRITNEY: There must be something in your life that's more important than getting it on!!The rest of the album sounds like Prince (\\"Brave New Girl\\"), No Doubt (\\"The Hook Up\\"), TLC (\\"Showdown\\"), Moby (Moby-produced \\"Early Mornin\\"), Kylie Minogue (\\"Breathe on Me,\\" \\"Touch of my hand\\"), Jay Z (\\"Outrageous\\") and more.  <br />BRITNEY, PLEASE, SURROUND YOURSELF WITH TALENT NOT MEDIOCRITY.  I KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING IT SAFE FOR YOUR RECORD COMPANY BUT, ARTISTICALLY, YOU ARE GOING NO WHERE...<br />CONSUMERS, DON'T PURCHASE THIS ALBUM...FOR QUALITY MUSIC, SEE NELLY FURTADO'S NEW ALBUM \\"FOLKLORE\\"...THAT'S WHAT I CALL TALENT!!! AND SHE'S CUTE TOO!
B00005JLKB|4.0|I've been an avid consumer of television shows since i was young. Growing up around the world of television is a world where i escape every night...this is where smallville fits in, when it first aired i wasn't excited nor was i pulled into the frenzy, i thought it wasn't my kind of thing. Not too long ago i was browsing along in a video store when i bumped into the box set of season one smallville, and i read the synopsis and finally thought that i might actually give it a try. After the first few episodes i got a bit maniacal, watching one show after another not getting enough of it.<br />Smallville besides its cover up face of superman deals with emotions of the real kind, its very down to earth if viewed in a different perspective, it definitely has its up and downs. Tom welling and Kristin Kreuk gives legitimate performance as two young high school kids who no one seems to understand...<br />get this dvd if you like watching television just for what it lives out to be...you won't regret it
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is full of dance and electronic/type beats.  I really like it.  I don't know why some others gave it bad reviews, but unfortunately, it seems that Britney can't seem to please some people.  Some thinks she acts too raunchy, others think she is too &quot;pop&quot; with no substance.  <BR>If you like dance and music like Kylie Minogue and other club songs, then you will love this.  The best song by far is &quot;Showdown&quot;.  My only drawback is she whispers a lot during the songs.  Other than that, I think this CD is her best yet
B0000E1WNV|3.0|What's this? <BR>Who produce this DVD? Shame on you!<BR>Who enjoy by listening this sound? I don't, and also if it's one of my favourites musicians DVD.<BR>The sound is totaly [bad.] I don't understand how can they done this to such a legend....I'm very angry about it. I was in big expectations about this DVD, becouse we all know what a great shows the boss and his band makes. And i wasn't wrong. The show was fantastic. But i just can't enjoy of watching this bad production DVD. Sorry, i just can't. This anoying me too much. Even the picture is not well as it could be. Quality of this DVD can not compare to \\"Live in NYC\\" DVD. So i suggest you to buy this DVD only if you want to see this great show and amazing audience in Barcelona. Otherwise buy NYC concert where for quality you won't regreat.
B000006OAM|5.0|This album grows on you. You know, like those little gourmet morsels you sampled hesitantly and then decided you didn't like. You finished chewing them and swallowed them down, but they left an unusual taste in your mouth and you said to yourself, &quot;Next time I'll just pass on that.&quot; Then, there you were again in that same restaurant and looking at those same little oddities and wondering why everyone else thought they were the bee's knees. So you ate another piece. Until one day you were asking for extra ones, and eagerly seeking them out in the grocery store.<br />Well that's this album. EXACTLY. One day I went from not really caring for it to craving it like a sweet; like chocolate. Suddenly, it fit into my soul like a perfect puzzle piece. When I get a taste for this album I cannot be satisfied with anything else. It soothes me and lifts me up all at once.<br />I would tell you my favorite track on it but then I would have to choose one. Unlike the critics, probably the only one I don't really care for is &quot;When They Ring the Golden Bells.&quot; Give this album a chance. Don't listen to the critics. It is off the beaten path and away from the mainstream, truly a rare treat for your adventurous palate.
B00005Y6YB|1.0|This is my favoriute all time movie, however I too have seen this hacked up version. I hoped to find the original in a DVD format, but after finding it unavailable have chosen not to purchase.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Ok...ill b honest...i downloaded the album last week coz it got leaked on2 the internet..but bcoz i love a.keys i had 2 buy it this mornin'!;)...every tune is heavyyy<BR>im feelin diary the most <BR>but every tune is a 5 star tune in some way<BR>every1 cop this album!!!!!!<BR>MARZ ATTACK(&quot;,)
B0000DD7NL|5.0|WOW! I had been waiting for this album to come out for some time and it was well worth the wait. Alicia keeps the spirit of R &amp; B fresh and hip with her soulful ballads and sultry voice. I have been watching MTV and seeing the video/song &quot;You don't know my name&quot;, it was love at first listen. There are a lot of great tracks on this album and I don't think it would be fair of me to rate them as of yet seeing as how I have only given the CD a listen through once since purchase this afternoon. Songs that did stand out to me on the first listen were: &quot;Karma, If I was Your Woman/Walk On By, If I Ain't Got You, Diary, When You Really Love Someone, and of course You Don't Know My Name.&quot; Virtually the whole album, and that was just the first listen. <br />Go get this album...you'd better know her name.
0792163710|1.0|Disney presents Shane in panoramic Technicolor! Ugh. How could they have turned such a brilliant, to the point novel into this movie? Shane fans, new and old alike, please avoid this film, which is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. What a shame is Shane.
B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson is a legend in his own right. He has soared to the top of the charts over the years, and Thriller is not only Michael's best album, but one of the best albums to ever be released.<BR>Jackson showcases all of his talents over the course of Thriller, and this album is where he spawned his greatest hits ever. Michael Jackson is not only the most interesting figure in music, but also the most inspirational figure ever in music. Artists in modern day have owed their inpiration to him, and his music spawned new genres of pop, funk, disco, and even rap. Michael Jackson is also the most recognized figure in music, and even though he is in the midst of child rape charges among other strange events, Jackson will always be loved. This is his best album, and I highly encourage any fan of pop music to buy it! <BR>Standout songs are:<BR>-Billie Jean<BR>-Thriller (the most popular song/video ever made)<BR>-Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
B00009TB5G|4.0|See...the Hobbits are supposed to be the common man, the people we relate to. Aragorn and his ilk are supposed to be the mythical, those we watch through the Hobbit's eyes. But it seemed like in this film the Hobbits played less of a role, in favor of Aragorn being the main character. More power to them, as this choice is probably safer in terms of making movie-goers happy, but it personally made me like it a bit less then the last flick.
B000127LW2|1.0|Being A Life Time Trekkie I can't see buying this series, not that it wasn't that bad but....<BR>16 episodes for $90 ?<BR>What will the next set cost?  $149?<br />By far the worst of the series (excluding most of the Originals bad episodes).<BR>This degrades the prices of both TNG & DS9.  (both I own)<br />Make a decent offer.... say, $49 for the first season and $79 per season, for the rest<br />I rate it one star (on the price) three stars overall.
0790729725|2.0|Who cares about any of these people? They could all die and it wouldn't make a difference to me.
B0000028SU|5.0|This album, along with Human Touch, are probably the most under-rated of all of Springsteen's albums.  I really think that the radio airplay in the early 90s missed the mark totally, by ignoring songs like &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot;, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, &quot;Living Proof&quot;, &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;, and &quot;My Beautiful Reward&quot;.
B000069KGM|4.0|I won't dwell on the artistic merit of this album. Plenty of other reviews cover that ground. If you think you're interested in this album, it probably isn't a debate over jazz-rock and the place of horns in rock and roll that's keeping you on the fence. I'm only going to talk about the sound.<br />Rhino has done an admirable job with this remaster. I've often wondered about the quality of the master tapes for the first three Chicago albums, since the finished recordings (even on the original LPs) sounded like they'd been recorded with two tin cans and a string. I'm happy to say this remaster belies that impression. Rhino has managed to unearth, if not a great recording, a startlingly good one, easily worth purchasing. The liner notes talk about the band recording more or less live in the studio, to 8 tracks, in the middle of the night since the more established acts like Simon &amp; Garfunkel had the mid-day times reserved. It's easy to picture them all in the studio, working together simultaneously on this project. The horns may have been potted down a little bit in the final mix, but from the sound it's just as easy to imagine them standing to the left, near the back wall of the studio (which may have been the actual physical arrangement, given how overpowering brass can be). The only thing I would downgrade the recording on is the tendency at the time to mix stereo recordings to pure Left-Center-Right, which doesn't exactly make for a naturally spread soundstage.<br />Long and short - if you have any fondness for Chicago's beginnings, before they turned into Peter Cetera's Ballad Band, get this CD. It's almost as much of an improvement in Chicago's recorded sound as the Stones' SACD releases have been for theirs.
B0000028SR|5.0|This album, along with Lucky Town, are probably the most under-rated of all of Springsteen's albums.  I really think that the radio airplay in the early 90s missed the mark totally, by ignoring songs like &quot;Gloria's Eyes&quot;, &quot;Roll Of The Dice&quot; (a no-brainer hit for FM), &quot;Man's Job&quot;, &quot;I Wish I Were Blind&quot;, &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;, and &quot;My Beautiful Reward&quot;.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Every song on this christmas album is perfect.  It's too bad that some people still can't get over that Whitney is human and that she has done mistakes like the rest of us.  All the negative reviews have the words Crack or Bobby in them, it's getting ridiculous.  The *MUSIC* on this album is what matters and Whitney did EXCELLENT.  Her voice is very warm , she belts powerful notes, she sings soft, she does it all.<br />The highlights for me are O Holy Night (wait til you see the powerful notes she does late in the song), also Joy to the World taken from the Preacher's Wife is perfect.  Other highlights include One Wish, the Christmas Song (where she belts the word &quot;fly&quot; extremely high you will be amazed), Silent Night/Deck the Halls which is BRILLIANTLY arranged, and The Little Drummer Boy with her daughter again with very interesting arrangements once the song evolves.  Also on the song &quot;I'll be Home For Christmas&quot;, Whitney ends the song with a perfect soft note that is 15 seconds long.  <br />I'm telling you, if you want a perfect christmas album full of great singing and great arrangements, then this is it.  Whitney is not perfect as a human being, she's done mistakes like the rest of us, but it is clear that she's putting her life back together.  This album is AMAZING.
0061015725|5.0|Prey, by Michael Crichton has the same great thriller formula to be a great success as Jurassic Park.<br />Crichton does an amazing job in capturing every detail of every single character. His knowledge of science and technology has proved much successful in this book. Crichton abilities to keep the reader on the edge of his seat until the final pages of the book are astonishing. He never loses his charisma to always surprise you when u least expect it. He does this greatly, when jack finally realizes that his wife is not what she seems to be. And that she has been taken over by the swarm. Like every other novel Crichton has written, he has lessons that can always be applied to real life. Jurassic Park showed that humanity does not have the right to play God. As for this book, Michael does a phenomenal job protesting the fact that humans depend on machines to a very dangerous degree. And as this book shows, that technology can be the end of humanity. This fact unfortunately remains true. If humans depend on machines for everything eventually machines will replace most of us. As we can see in our lives today, the works of machines have replaced factory workers, industry workers, and many other forms of labor. On a lighter note, this book I would have to say is honestly the best work Michael Crichton has ever done. I would recommend it to anyone who is in interested in the harmful effects of technology on our lives or anyone looking for great thriller. This book I am sure will leave u breath less long after u have put it done.
B0000DZEA1|3.0|Quite a disapointment. Although there are some memorable tracks, the whole score is weak compared with the TTT especially.  The end credit song is also forgetable.
B000069CWE|1.0|I am a huge Linkin Park fan. I consider Hybrid Theory and Meteora to be two of the best CDs I own. I anxiously awaited the release of Reanimation, and I was severely disappointed. I always expect great things from Linkin Park, but they missed the target on this one. They focused more on the &quot;rap&quot; part of rap-metal, something that doesn't interest me that much. I personally do not think that their songs are meant to be re-mixed. The wonderful guitar is lost behind the techno-rap sounds, and Chester's great voice is replaced with people like Motion Man. I want to hear him and Mike sing more than the &quot;guests&quot; on the album. Aaron Lewis butchered their most amazing song, Crawling, and this was what I was most disappointed with. Others aren't supposed to sing their songs. I do not recommend this album.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This movie truly touched my heart.  If you are a horse lover, you'll adore this movie. If you are not a horse lover, you'll adore this movie.  I was skeptical at first because I know nothing of horses or racing, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to follow the story and to truly feel through the superb acting and storyline. This movie inspired me to read the book from which it was based from!  I highly highly recommend this picture to anyone who enjoys movies on the same level as Forest Gump or Chariots of Fire.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|The DVD edition has everything shown on the 25th Anniversary Cinemax documentary, including &quot;Raw Iron&quot; and &quot;Iron and Beyond.&quot; It is not edited (as another review suggested) for content and the original Pumping Iron is completely in tact.<br />The best feature is a 15 minute interview with Arnold as a sort of FAQ about the film. He answers questions like &quot;Was that a real joint you were smoking,&quot; &quot;Did you take steroids,&quot; and &quot;Did you really miss your own father's funeral&quot;. He answers with the great candor and confidence that he is famous for. The DVD is worth it for this piece alone!<br />Now STOP READING THIS AND HIT THE GYM!!!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I watched this movie, expecting a Blade/Resident Evil/slightly Matrix plot and special effects, and that is precisely what I recieved. The movie is well done with entertaining special effects, and the plot is fairly creative. I did enjoy Kate Beckinsale's portrayl of a dark action hero.  However, this picture seems to have nothing for a non- Blade/Resident Evil/slightly Matrix fan.
B000002UAU|5.0|I know people who (as I used to be) are turned off from the Beatles, and this album in particular, due to the incredible hype and reputation that precede it. All you hear is that it's the greatest album ever. If you are hearing Sgt. Pepper's for the first time just set that aside and focus on the music. It will blow you away, as it did me. The first concept album gives the music plenty of space and innovated almost all production techniques that are commonplace today. Things like the effect on John's voice on \\"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\\", the huge wall of noise that creates the catharsis break-up between the verses of \\"A Day In the Life\\", the thumping sticcato of \\"When I'm 64\\", the different tempos of the songs, the way the songs play through the end of one and into the beginning of the next, everything is just perfect. Some would say \\"Sure, but everyone does these things. What makes Sgt. Pepper's special?\\" Aside from the consistently classic caliber of the songs, this is the FIRST time those things were heard. This album is the best ever created, and paved the way for all the music you hear nowadays. If you don't have it, grab it up quick and be amazed.
0385504209|5.0|This book is simply amazing.  The story is very exciting and there are so many interesting and incredible facts throughout the book that it...it...I forgot what I was saying.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Hands down the most definitive collection for sci-fi, action and horror collectors. Get this before the release of \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" so you have the entire collection.<br />These movies are not just cool due to the appearance of the aliens in them. The surreal artistry of H. R. Giger makes the original a classic.<br />Each movie has two versions. I like the slight alterations in the story digitally masterfully edited so that the movie holds its own merit in either version. If that wasn't enough you get documentaries, photo galleries, original nostalgic movie trailers, crew-commentary and more. Its a very thorough treatment of the 4 movies.<br />As a DVD collector this is one of the best purchases I have ever made due to its entertainment value and price. Thnks to all involved in this DVD collection.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|There's a neat easter egg, a modernized trailer of the movie that runs for just over a minute. <br />Sourced from DVDReview.com: &quot;Insert the second disc of the set in your DVD Player and on the Main Menu of the DVD highlight the menu entry 'Documentaries.' Now press the 'Left' arrow key on your remote control and the title 'Once Upon A Time In The West' will be highlighted. If you press the 'Enter' key now, you will be treated to a very cool - and brand-new - looking trailer for the movie.&quot;
0385504209|5.0|One of the most interesting and engrossing books I have seen in a long while. Dan Brown's research is phenomenal. Opus Dei took it seriously enough to mention it on their website so he ruffled a few feathers.<br />The book says you can make 62 English words out of PLANETS...<br />I am up to 47.<br />I recommend this highly.
B00005JMFO|2.0|Nearly half the vignettes presented in this ensemble film are utter trash....forced, phony, unrealistic and difficult to watch. The rest are varying degrees of charming and good. Emma Thompson deserves mention for a really good, really heartwrenching piece of acting...but she never seems like she is acting. Liam Neeson is wasted on a piece of trash involving his stepson....who does not talk or act like a child his age: It is so irritating when movies portray a child as a small, cute adult. This one is particularly uncharming and involves a borderline-icky crush on a waaaayyy too mature singing star 10-year-old girl. Weird and almost creepy. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are graceful, dashing charming actors who have made a great living out of playing charming, dashing bumblers. They do a great job in their lovely respective stories. But by far the worst and best are as follows: The vignette featuring the couple who is newly married and the best friend with the unrequited crush on the bride is PAINFULLY BAD. The actress playing the bride is unbearably forced and SO irritating. Her would-be love is Casper Milquetoast who is clearly besotted with her looks. \\"You are perfect\\" he says. Oh Yuck. The very best is the aging rock star making a really sad comeback, but he plays it as a hilarious good time. If the whole movie were about him, it would have been GREAT. He was STELLAR. It's all a mixed bag... sort of a C-plus
B0000DJZA5|5.0|the 1970 version,there both five stars,simply because any album with Let it be,Across the universe,Get back,Long and winding road, and Two of us on it deserves 5 stars,then and now!!!
B00009V7RF|5.0|This album reminds me a of a P-Funk child. Not quite pure George Clinton, but there is enough funkiness and experimetation going on to merit Supergroovelisticfunkdification. I just love this album.
0061015725|2.0|I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list (blech.)<br />This book is a fast, pleasant read. The early portions were quite promising, evoking a feeling of creeping doom. I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.<br />However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution. The last portions degenerate to a long &quot;beat the unstoppable monster&quot; sequence.<br />Might make a good movie on the Sci-Fi channel.<br />Save your money. Or, use it to buy Charles Pellegrino's &quot;Dust&quot;.
0385504209|4.0|This book was well written with a very clear structure and plot that was so compelling that I finished the book in two sittings. The structure and logic was so overwhelming, however, that the characters and settings were quite underdeveloped. They were like phantoms that served as mere facilitators to drive the plot.<br />I believe that Iain Pears has mastered the &quot;art history mystery&quot; genre and his books probably served as a model for &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. I would highly recommend the following:<br />The Raphael Affair by Iain Pears<br />Death and Restoration (Art History Mystery) by Iain Pears<br />The Bernini Bust (Art History Mystery) by Iain  Pears<br />The Last Judgement (Art History Mystery) by Iain Pears<br />The Titian Committee by Iain Pears
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Although it is not Dream Theaters best cd, it is still extremely good in compairison to any other bands cds.  I see all these people compairing it to old metallica, but i see no resemblence, LaBrie's voice sounds nothing of Hetfields and every aspect of the band is so much more amazing than Metallica's constant palm muting.  So if you arent buying this album because of the reviews who say its old metallica or pantera, then you need to not listen to these reviews and give the cd a listen.  Pettruci throws down another amazing performance on guitar. Myung still continues to amaze me on the bass. James LaBries vocals are still as amazing as ever.  Mike Portnoy's drumming is impossible to match by any drummer that is living right now.  and Rudess's keyboarding skill can probably make an old man with erectial disfunctions pop a chubby.  I highly reccomend this album no matter what genre of rock your into.<br />Best Tracks: Dying Soul or Endless Sacrfice.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown is not a great writer, but I give him credit where his credit is due. He has written a wildly entertaining book about a symbologist's unlikely search for the true Holy Grail. Once started on this novel, it is nearly impossible to put down.<br />Having read books on the thories of the &quot;true&quot; Grail, I respect Brown for his excellent research on the topic, and he comes across like he really knows what he is talking about. The idea of the Vatican being an over-protective, almost evil entity is intriguing, and kept me flipping to see what would happen next.<br />The characters are all likeable here, which is a neccesity in this type of mystery novel, including the albino monk Silas. Of the few problems in this book is the way that Brown puts out each puzzle to be solved. He delays the answer long enough for the reader to make their best possible guess, and then the answer is discovered by some inprobable means or accident, usually by the one person who should not be able to get the answer. Happiness ensues, while the main character Robert Langdon kicks himself for not knowing and then delving into an explanation of why he should know and where the answer came from. This formula works, but gets tiring by the end of the novel.<br />But aside from the literary problems, this book is excellent if looked at as a piece of entertainment, a beach book. It is a fun romp through Paris in search of something that has eluded man for thousands of years, and many interesting propositions are put forth about the nature of the Holy Grail, and of the life of Jesus Christ. For those who are more interested in the subject, I would recommend &quot;The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail&quot;, a former bestseller that shocked many people with the ideas of the sacred feminine and the bloodlline of Jesus.
B00004SQQX|5.0|i recently obtained this album from a friend and i must say it is a magic album.. one you can listen to the whole way through and not get bored.. i dont understand the french language but the lyrics and beats flow so well together that it doesnt matter.... this album is a must for hip hop heads.....
0385720920|2.0|Reading through \\"Choke\\", it did not take me until the end to realize that there really was no point to the whole novel. The endless episodes of Victor choking in restaurants, having strange sexual encounters, visiting his mother in the hospital leads us to the conclusion that...what? I agree that this novel offers a sarcastic and often grim outlook on American life as we know it, but that does not seem to be enough to keep this fractured plot moving. <br />I like the way that Palahniuk writes, it is choppy yet fast moving. His use of repetition works for the most part, although he manages to go overboard on this as well. So many of the elements of this book seem to be taken directly from \\"Fight Club\\", such as the way Victor hangs around meetings for sexual addicts, the same way that the Edward Norton character always went to meetings just to make himself feel better. The cynical nature of the author is good, and he puts this across well, but alas, with no payoff, no point in sight. <br />Overall, this is a decent read, but expect nothing great from it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|OK ppl this girl is just no ordinary singer...She's a true ARTIST. This CD reflects her VOICE, verstality, GENIUS and her TRUE EMOTIONS. Every song seems to be coming out of her heart...Beautiful, Impossible, Infatuation, Make Over, Loving Me 4 Me, and Get Mine Get Yours are amazing, and the rest have great variety and quality. Go Christina, sing it...
0385507755|5.0|&quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;, the story of James Frey and his battle through drug and alcohol addiction is an incredibly dark story, taking readers through the absolute hell that rehab must be. This book is not glossed-over or Hollywood-ized, so that everybody is happy and sober at the end. This is not a Sandra Bullock movie, and in real life, things do not always end the way they should.<br />Waking up battered, bleeding and unaware of his surroundings, James is put into one of the best detox centers in America by his frightened family. There he must clean himself up before he can get on with his life, or else face death on the outside if he continues to live the way he was living. His addictions are many, from alcohol to crack cocaine to gas, and he is forced to face life without them, while getting to know the people inside the center, and learn about their struggles and their lives. <br />James never wants to get close to people, and he angers the doctors because of his refusal to take part in several things. He knows he must come around himself, must find a reason to live other than getting high. He seems to find this in a girl there, causing more problems with the hospital. <br />The writing style of this book is odd, using no indentation and odd punctuation, but it really works, and does not read as choppy as I thought it would. It takes a few pages to get used to, but once you are going, it no longer becomes an issue. I feel that this is the only way a book like this could have been written. It is fractured, just like the mind of the author at that time, and it shows a grit that is important in the telling of this story. <br />This book is dark, somber and sad, often sucking the life right out of the reader, but that seems to be the point. Drug addiction is not a glamorous life like it is in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and &quot;28 Days&quot;, and James Frey should be commended on the excellent job of getting this point across. <br />This is a remarkable book, and I hope Frey keeps writing, because he has an authentic voice, one that could possibly speak up for an entire generation.
B000089CJI|5.0|Let me tell you, when I bought this CD I knew that my ears would be in for a treat, but when i put in on the ol' Sony, i imediatly knew that this band would go down in the Crawford family book of grand CDs. The Postal Service has sent me a letter of beauty, beauty and passion, beauty passion and and little bit of love sprinkled on top. It is just that good. It is just that good. It is just that grand. A grand band.<br />      My friends I've devoted the first Paragraph to why this band is great, but this paragraph I will explain to you why this CD is a masterpiece. First of all the lyrics are wise as any lyrics I've ever heard, and I've heard lyrics my friend heh heh, I've heard lyrics. The song &quot;recycled air&quot;, is will just take you to other worlds. I really love music, I love music so much. Some songs bring a tear to my eye, no joke. Some of these songs you just sit back and say shucks that song makes me want to sit back think. It's one of those bands that you get something new everytime you hear the songs. <br />         So my unknown chums, I urge you to spend the little money I know you have tucked away in a drawer and buy some food. After you buy that food, use the rest to buy this CD. Unless the food you bought is this CD. In which it wouldn't be food at all. Idiot. Why are you calling a CD food? Wow. What a CD. It is so good that you actually thought it was food.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I found this album even better than the first one....tho I felt in love with songs in a minor... this new album has really impressed me since the first note I heard.. its unique and definetely full of SOUL...I recommend it to absolutly everybody. I dont think I could say anythin else coz its hard to describe, just go check it yourselves...
B00005JLSE|5.0|Pop, six, squish, uh-oh, Cicero, Lipschitz...............<BR>What do these words have in common? Words chosen randomly to fit into two groups of three? Maybe aliases given by ravErs @ a Mack and Bellvue flashback of yesteryear? Or maybe I was six words short of my word requirement. No, its none of those...it's the opening line of one of the hottest numbers from Chicago. The song entitled \\"Cell Block Tango\\" uses these key words to segue into the murderous tales of six women on death row. From husbands and boyfriends, Arsenic and gunshots, guilty and not guilty, each woman's story unfurls. Elegantly, the seductiveness of the tango, the danger of murder and the cold hard edge of prison are combined to formulate a dynamic song and dance.<BR> This is not where the magic ends...actors perform all of the songs! Now this is customary for theatrical performances but very rare in Hollywood. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, and Renee Zellweger did Hollywood Proud. These stars showed their versatility and looked great doing it. <BR>     Just the opposite goes for Queen Latifah. Although her roots have been mostly in music/rap, recently the Queen has been appearing on the big screen. Being a pioneer for women in the rap industry has been her forte; but anyone that didn't know before knows now that her talent extends far beyond that. The Queen's Sarah Vaughn like vocals shine, and add a little flavor to the already all-star cast. Rappers turned actors, actors that sing and dance...what's next, a 7'4 Chinese guy playing basketball?!  J<BR> I understand that musicals aren't for the butch. Having had a theatrical background, yes I am biased. But don't let the common misconceptions of the musical deter this endeavor. There is no boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, obstacles arise, love overcomes obstacle, and a happily ever after ending while singing all the while. Somehow Chicago weeded out all the corny, sappy, melodramatic goo and replaced it with all the components that put on an enchanting show. <BR>     Gorgeous costumes, beautiful actors, excellent use of color and photography, coupled with an outstanding score and outstanding vocals make this movie a must see. This movie will be enjoyable for all ready to embrace the new face of theater or thespians ready for a new notch in their proscenium arch. Thirteen Oscar Nominations, three awards from the SAG (screen actors guild) awards, and five from the Academy: including best picture, can't be that bad. So microwave some popcorn,  kick back, try something new, and enjoy the flavor of theater nuveau.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Sir Paul's pet project is finally here, the &quot;corrected&quot; version of the star-crossed Let It Be LP that Phil Spector so notoriously &quot;improved&quot; (opinions differ on this issue, but McCartney for one was never happy with the Spector treatment).  The dynamics of the music are much improved by the overall remastering and the removal of Phil Spector's layers of effects and glop.  While I personally miss some of the off-the-cuff outbursts and false starts/false endings  of the original LP, I do admire the cleaner , crisper sound (check out Ringo's drumming, as brilliant as it ever was), ringing guitars, and elegant  new purity of songs like Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road sans ersatz choirs and heavenly strings.  (Paul's songs are the most noticeably altered, since they were the ones originally the most warped by Spectorization. )  Across the Universe also sounds better than it ever has before (although I rather like the Anthology II alternate take, too;  and there's another fine version on a bootleg disc with lots of phased effects, backwards guitars, and heavier sitar).  So we have a nice punchy Beatles record that fits much more comfortably into the slot between the White Album and Abbey Road -- not the band's strongest collection of material, but not bad for something dashed off in less than a month between two inarguably classic LPs.<br />The short bonus disk included with this initial pressing is mainly disposable -- bits of random conversations and snatches of ad-libbed song lines, mainly, the sort of stuff that fills many weary hours of underground records  -- the only highlight is the inclusion of the previously  available-only-on-bootlegs complete run-through of the old Liverpool dockside chestnut Maggie Mae segued into Fancy Me Chances.  John and Paul could have made a fair living as street buskers, obviously.<br />The new version of this LP, like the old version, is Lennon-McCartney top-heavy.  No Ringo Moment was orchestrated during these sessions, and George only contributed two lesser songs (I Me Mine was in fact only recorded a year later even though an early version was jammed on in early 1969).  Sadly, the band's two heavyweights  couldn't get interested in Harrisong gems like All Things Must Pass or Isn't It A Pity, which were cursorily worked on by the Beatles at this time but never taken up in earnest, to be left for George's solo LP the following year.<br />I should also emphasize that the new album's tracks are  not simply the old tracks with Phil Spector's overdubs removed.  You can hear completely new vocals in many places, making me think that Spector either used different vocal takes for his version or he inserted a lot of edits that are now gone, leaving the original master vocals in place.  It's a very different sounding record.<br />Finally, perhaps the chief delight is something that will be overlooked-- the booklet liner notes feature extensive transcripts of Beatles session chat, and it is an absolute riot.  The guys' private language and almost -psychic ability to pick up on one another's thoughts are on full display (it really shows how hard it is for an outsider to penetrate their world or recapture their way of speaking among themselves).  Not to be missed, and worth the price of the album alone!ng these sessions, and George only contributed two lesser songs (I Me Mine was in fact only recorded a year later even though an early version was jammed on in early 1969).

0345448898|5.0|This is my favorite fantasy series of all time. Incredibly engrossing and inventive, it's an easy read while still having very deep ideas and valuable meaning.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|WOW! This new album that comes out today, December 2nd, is simply marvelous. Songs In A Minor was a good CD but only showcased a fraction of the voice and talent that Alicia Keys has. This CD gives listeners everything that she has. Plus, the CD had just a couple of hip-hopish type songs on it that created a minor the overall quality of the CD. \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\" has nothing but neo-soul, classic R&B and jazzy rythems that go well beyond the border of her previous CD, lyrically and, of course, musically. I don't think anyone expected such an almost flawless CD such as this because even the greatest artist can suffer from the \\"sophomore slump\\". But Alicia Keys doesn't go anywhere near it. This CD can be expected to do well in stores and everyone should take a listen to this masterpiece. Even people who aren't fans of her will like this CD (agreeing with some of the other reviews). Here are the song reviews:<br />1. Harlem's Nocturne- The intro to this CD is a showcase of Alicia Keys' gift: Playing The Piano. She plays it beautifully and it adds a sort of charm that the opener of \\"Songs In A Minor\\" didn't have with \\"Girlfriend\\". After her piano solo, the song breaks into an explanation of her \\"Diary\\", with a piano-laced urban beat in the background. An amazing entrance. (**** out of 5)<br />2. Karma- Probably the song that's the most beat-driven on the entire CD. Unfortunately, there is no piano in this song but it's not expected either. Her voice sounds very mature compared to some of the tracks on her previous album in this song in particular. Cliched theme though...(**** out of 5)<br />3. Heartburn- A 70s-esque jam that sounds disco-like. Not the best but notible at the same time. Still showcases Alicia's newfound mature voice though. (*** out of 5)<br />4. If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By- I love this remake. It sounds so good! The song is just perfect for her to belt it out when necessary. Plus the chorus is so catchy! Probably my favorite behind the next track...(**** out of 5)<br />5. You Don't Know My Name- I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE FIRST SINGLE OFF OF THE ALBUM. It's so different and sounds just like as if it was on Mowtown. If you haven't heard this song, you need to go to the website or something and see what I'm talking about. The track is so soulful and even includes an interlude in the middle of the song like music from the 50s, 60s and 70s. The best song on the CD by far and the foremost reason to purchase it (***** out of 5- Because Of Sheer Brilliance)<br />6. If I Ain't Got You- A jazzy addition to the album. Just a piano, some low-key drums and her strong voice are all she needs to carry this song. If performed live, this song, in particular, would bring people to their feet. It's that powerful. The lyrics are very well written. Definity a high point. (***** out of 5- Because Of The Greatness Of The Song Lyrically And Musically)<br />7. Diary (feat. Tony!Toni!Tone!)- Another heavy hitter that reinforces the neo-soul, R&B theme of this CD. Besides not being a really \\"jazzy\\" song, just more today's normal R&B like, both \\"Diary\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" are very similar in terms of ratings. Refer to song #6- \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" (**** out of 5)<br />8. Dragon Days- Not my favorite on the album but it's not bad. Besides having some quite \\"peculiar\\" symbolism and different instruments than a lot of the other tracks, it's not one of the standouts. Even so, lyrically, \\"Dragon Days\\" one of the best on the album and Alicia's still sounds good on it. (*** out of 5)<br />9. Wake Up- I love this song. Another jazzy addition but it includes an orchestra vs. a piano. Alicia sounds very mature and takes this simple song to lengths beyond what it COULD have been. Not a standout, perce', but it's a favorite. (*** out of 5) <br />10. So Simple- Another one of my favorites. Although the song is very simple (no pun intended), using basic instruments and basic lyrics, it still sounds exellent. Morphing Alicia's voice wasan exellent idea and makes the song really stand out. Also, the chorus is going to make anymore start belting it out once they hear it...(*** out of 5)<br />11. When You Really Love Somebody- Oooh! This jazzy tune goes so well with the album's theme and is another catchy song. Although it is nowhere near the power of \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", it still showcases some of the best vocals on the album. Lyrically, though, it really doesn't show any ingenuity. But you won't even give even words a second though after a listen...(*** out of 5)<br />12. Feeling U, Feeling Me- Put this on and you will be doing one of two things: Pretending your at you're favorite jazz/blues club or pretending your with your girl/guy at that moment. This short and almost wordless song has a bluesy style and is an instrumental wonder for people that like that type of music. Since it's not really a song, though, I'm not going to rate it...(N/A)<br />13. Slow Down- My least favorite on the album. \\"Wake Up\\" is very lackluster for this CD and doesn't test her voice at all. A good message is exploited but it's probably the closest to filler on this the album. (** out of 5)<br />14. Samsonite Man- YES! It's named after the luggage. So you can probably decipher what it's about just by that. The lyrics are really deep and actually make you feel pitiful about anybody that has to deal with that topic. The R&B beat goes with the song and the syncopation is great on this song. Alicia shows her talent on this as well. (**** out of 5)<br />15. Nobody Not Really (Interlude)- An outro to this amazing album is driven by a saxophone and Alicia summing up her \\"Diary\\". Smooth soul that's as pure as it comes. A notable end to a masterpiece.
0345448898|5.0|To all the Christians who believe that this is a heretic book, I would ask you to please look a little closer and realize that the God in the story does not model the God of our religion. Rather, like Plato's Republic, it is a demonstration of the weakness of an idea. This book shows us that deities are in no way physically alike or connected to mortal beings and, in fact, shows us God's transcendence of our reality. Phillip Pullman is an intellectual person who takes time to think about his beliefs rather than going along with everyone else.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Look, I'm very aware that many people are going to hate this review but come on folks. The music industry needs a good kick in the a$$ and I'm just brave enough to admit. Honestly, how can people give this crap so much credit? This is BAD music, not unlike Britney Spears or NSTINK, but at least they KNOW their music sucks. Stinkin Park on the other hand seems to think they're some big heavy metal band just waiting to scare the sh*t out of us at their concerts. That's how stupid they are. I mean, what is this world coming to? Are people really confusing rock with rap nowadays?. So much that worthless garbage like Stinkin Park and Limp Bizksh*t are referred to as metal nowadays? <br />And if the rap isn't bad enough, I hate everything else on this album too. First of all, they have one of the whiniest singers ever. Yeah, now THAT's metal!!! Add on some bland, boring guitars and a guy who seems to have headphones implanted to his skull, and a f*ckin DJ. Whose idea was that???<br />Folks, if you want REAL metal, I strongly suggest these bands: Slayer, Pantera, Down, Opeth, Superjoint Ritual, Meshuggah, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Dimmu Borgir, Lacuna Coil, Arch Enemy, Cradle of Filth, Stratovarius, Nile and Soilwork. <BR>At least check these bands out before you find yourself smothered in by nu-metal crap. And if you STILL want to be popular, then at least listen to the GOOD numetal bands: System Of A Down, Sevendust, Otep, Coal Chamber and Chimaira. <br />So, guys, I know their are going to be a lot of LP fans on my ass, but I just wanted to warn the innocent before they give into this godawful crap. We need to separate rap from metal before it's too late!<br />Good day now.
1565117700|5.0|Of Mice and Men was a wonderfully written book and I really enjoyed reading it.  One reason I really liked the book is that it taught me a lot about how to be a good friend.  George and Lennie were very good companions.  When Lennie got discouraged, George helped him by telling him to dream about the farm and tending the rabbits. They were always there for each other.  When Lennie got in a fight, George told him to fight back.  George and Lennie were very good friends.<BR> Another reason why I liked the book is that here were colorful characters.  There was a wide variety of different characters.  Lennie was big and nice, but Curly was small and mean.  All the characters had qualities that set them apart from the others.  The characters in this book were fantastic.<BR> I also like this book because I like John Steinbeck's writing.  All his words are nice and simple.  His sentences are short but also very descriptive.  For example when he described Lennie, he wrote that his hand was like a big claw.  He is a great writer!<BR> This book is one of my favorite books.  I would most definitely recommend it to other people.  I read eagerly wondering what was going to happen to Lennie.  Of Mice and Men is the best book I have read in a while.  If I could only read one book this would be the book!
B000002KY8|5.0|I remember my sister buying a copy of the cd and it didn't have DMSR on it! That is the best song on the album. Talk about funky music to jam to Dance, Music, Sex, Romance- what more do you need? There is not a single bad song on this entire thing. The three \\"hits\\" were a little overplayed (I was only one year old when they came out so what does that tell you?) but they are still classics! \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" is excellent! If you're free for a couple of hours... \\"Automatic\\", \\"Something in the Water\\", \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" and \\"Free\\" are the best. I'll stop because I could go on and on! If you haven't heard this, get it now! It's one of the best!

B000002MT0|5.0|I thought I lost him with &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;. As a girl that grew up listening to Prince I was a little disappointed with his 1991 release and even more shocked at the way other people loved it. These people obviously did not know his previous work. Well, he came back with &quot;Come&quot;, I don't care what anyone says. OK, out of ten tracks, only seven are worth listening to, but they are really worth listening to. In Cleveland, only &quot;Letitgo&quot; ever came on the radio but the other six were so much better. I already knew the fun cheerleader/dance team favorite, &quot;Loose&quot; from the Interactive game we had on our computer (some people thought we were crazy but that game was fun!). Then I heard &quot;Come&quot;, &quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Pheremone&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, and most importantly...&quot;Dark&quot; and I was in love all over! &quot;Dark&quot; is a song speaking out after heartbreak and if you thought that was great, try the version he included on Crystal Ball- it was fantastic!
0553573411|4.0|Robin Hobb, Royal Assassin (Bantam, 1996)<br />There should be a law against ending books like this, especially when they're the second part of a trilogy. Imagine what it must have been like for the poor souls who read this on the day of release, and then had to wait another year to find out what happened next.<br />Royal Assassin continues the story of Fitz, son of an abdicated prince, assassin for the king, user of magic both human and bestial. It also continues the building of the world of the Six Duchies, and adds a new component; while most of the diplomacy (outside the small world of Fitz, that is) in the world of the first novel in this trilogy took place with what amounts to a sledgehammer, the second novel brings in political intrigue on a much more delicate level. The king's two younger sons, Verity and Regal, sit ready to leap at one another's throats, as the four coastal duchies (who support Verity) and the two inland duchies (who support Regal) sit poised on the brink of conflict. It doesn't help matters much that the Mountain kingdom, which sits on the other side of the inland duchies, just married its daughter and queen-to-be off to Verity. Things look pretty bad for the inlanders, right? Well, if they were, we wouldn't have a novel.<br />Royal Assassin continues on at the same pace as did Assassin's Apprentice; it may be a huge-looking effort (my trade paperback version is 580 pages, and almost as thick as the trade paperback edition of that doorstop known as Harlot's Ghost), but believe me, now that you've gotten yourself into the story, the slowness with which it begins (as did Assassin's Apprentice) is easily forgivable, and you'll be sitting and reading long after you'd promised yourself you'd stop.<br />I warn you now: stop before you get to page five hundred, and wait until you've secured a copy of Assassin's Quest before reading the end of this novel. The twists and turns will leave you growling in frustration if you have to wait to dive into the last book in the trilogy. It's almost as memorable, and frustrating, an ending as we got from George R. R.

Justice System has ever come up with).<br />And with that, I'll go back to chewing my fingernails and waiting for the library to get the third volume back in (since I can't find it in any of the bookstores near me). ****the last book in the trilogy.

B000002LE6|5.0|When I was in first grade, \\"Lovesexy\\" and Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" were my two favorite CDs. At the time I was annoyed that I couldn't skip straight to \\"Anna Stesia\\" and \\"Positivity\\" when I wanted to hear them but over the years I came to appreciate this masterpiece more and more. The main thing about this CD that may have been a negative quality to other listeners is ingenious to me. Sit down and absorb the love and happiness that comes out of this continuous track of nine songs. As an adult, my favorite song is \\"When 2 R In Love\\", one of the most romantic love songs I have ever heard. <br />Nothing is forbidden and nothing is taboo when 2 r in love...
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This is a wonderful score and yes better than Gladiator.<BR>I loved Hans' score for the John Boorman film Beyond Rangoon<BR>and missed the exotic texture and style used for that film.  Last Samurai is a neat continuation of that.  Plus there are sections in Samurai that bring to mind the ponderous and emotional underscoring from The Thin Red Line.  Last Samurai is definitely Hans Zimmer's best work to date.  I can't wait to see the images this music was written for.
B000002LHX|5.0|It's funny how the best movie in the series also had the best soundtrack. Then again, this was the only soundtrack produced entirley by the man himself! The three singles were appropriate and the accompanying videos were memorable. (Partyman is among one of my all-time faves.) There are fun dance selections (Electric Chair, Partyman, Trust, Batdance) as well as mellow ballads. He was ahead of his time on this one, but I loved it then as I love it now! Who else can say &quot;jobba&quot; and still sound so cool?
B000059MEK|5.0|There's no deep, introspective lyrics to be had, and the whole thing is mainly comprised of dance beats and catchy sound effects, but I love this album greatly because it is so rich with incredibly crisp, resonating sound, and the combinations of hooks, beats, and melodies are phenomenal.  I had never heard such wonderfully complex, layered electonic music before I bought this album, and &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; blew me away on first listening.<br />If you want GOOD dance music, good electronic music, good new wave music, good synth-pop, or just good music, check out this album.  Not only is the music quality excellent, but the sound and production quality is second-to-none.  And if you're already a fan, I'd suggest &quot;Interstella 5555,&quot; the new DVD that features anime music videos set to the album in its entirety.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Super hero movies seem to be almost as trendy as reality TV thse days, so Fox and Marvel had a sure-fire winner when they put together the sequel to X-Men, one of the earliest super-hero movies to arise as the trend began. X2: X-Men United picks up exactly where the first movie left off. Wolverine is still searching for his identity, Rogue is still trying to fit in, and Magneto is still locked in a high-security plastic prison. However, some new characters have been added. Nightcrawler (played flawlessly by Allan Cumming) has been added to the story, and Pyro has bocome a major character, as opposed to his appearance in the first movie, which was more or less a cameo. Other interesting characters that were added include Lady Deathstrike (although mentioning her name is agruably a spoiler), Colossus, and Kitty Pryde. William Stryker is a non-mutant character who has been added, and is the main villain of the film. Jubilee also appeared, but only in a deleted scene which is included in the bonus features of the DVD. The story is the stuff of ideal sequels, and leaves the audience craving the third movie, which is on the way. What is most impressive is the fact that the entire cast has returned, with the exception of a recasting of Pyro, who was probably played by an extra in the original movie, anyway. The entire DVD is of the highest quality, and the menus are very cleverly designed, with each submenu being themed after a mutant power in the film. The only thing missing is a blooper reel, which I was hoping for. But anyway, this 2-Disc set is certainly worth your money!
031218087X|4.0|Digital Fortress by Dan Brown is a superior book.  After reading The Da Vinci Code I knew I had to find more books that he wrote.  He has a very unique writing style that is different from a lot of authors today.  All of his books are action packed and always leave you guessing; Digital Fortress is no different. The characters are very interesting and compliment each other well.   It is a technology thriller that has more turns than you will ever imagine. In a lot of books you can figure out what's going to happen, but Dan Brown has a way of keeping you on your toes. \\"Susan sat up. Emergency? She had never heard the word emergency cross commander Strathmore's lips.  An emergency? In Crypto? She couldn't imagine. page 4\\" <BR> One of the themes of this book is that someone is always watching.  As more technology is developed and released more security measures have to be taken.  One of the main parts of this book is that the government can read everything that goes on over the internet, from what internet sites you look at to reading your private emails. People have no privacy on the internet.  If that's the case, then it's good in the sense that they can intercept potentially harmful information, but bad because you lose your privacy.  <BR> This would be a book I would definitely recommend for others.  Dan Brown has an unorthodox way of presenting his chapters in one to two pages, but that makes for easy reading and the ability to switch around from character to character.  The more you get into the book, the more you don't want to put it down.  If you have read any of Dan Brown's other books you won't be disappointed with Digital Fortress.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|So Whitney put the crack pipe down long enough to make a Christmas cd. And a duet with her daughter. How so very sweet. I wish Whitney would stop acting so ghetto. This cd is a step in the right direction but it'll take more than songs about Christmas to undo all the harm she has done to her career.
B00008PW2D|2.0|This is a great show, and season six has been fantastic, but season five was just not up to par. The two stars I gave it are for 1)Charlotte's affair with Harry and 2)the last episode (the wedding in the Hamptons.) Those were the only highlights!
B00005JMGC|3.0|Having so much respect for Julia Roberts as an actress, my husband and I gladly accepted an invitation to go see a special advance screening of this film.  As expected, we had the greatest pleasure of watching Julia's talent shining in this film that reminded me of Dead Poet's Society and Emperor's Club.  But that was the only favorable thing I can say about this film.  I agree that it has a good message but also feel that it is an archaic message that doesn't really give the audience much to think about, unlike the messages that make you reflect upon your lives and the current society.  I don't doubt that many in the audience found this film very entertaining because it made them laugh about the values imposed upon women of that period, which, from our contemporary point of view, appear vastly absurd.  I also found that many of the classroom teaching scenes were just unrealistic and transitions between many scenes were so awkward, which undermines the merit of the film.  Overall I will rate this film much lower than either Dead Poet's Society or Emperor's Club.
B0000DBJ2B|3.0|I'm a huge fan of The Dark Crystal (it and Labyrinth are my favourite movies of all time ever) so I was of course thrilled when a special collector's edition was released.  However, I'm disappointed in the &quot;features&quot;.<br />Pretty much everything on the disc is the same as what's on the non-collector's edition.  The few new things to me aren't worth it.  Character Illustrations and storyboards are nice and all.  I was excited about &quot;The Mithra Treatment&quot;, which I thought was the original print of the movie...where the characters speak their own language and not English (you see some of this in the deleted scenes on the disc).  It is not.  It is simply screens and screens of Henson's original notes.  Interesting yes... but I'd rather have that in a booklet, not in screens on my TV.  Then again, the fact that it was only 1 disc should have tipped me off.<br />The packaging is nice, the replica of Henson's notepad detailing the original ideas which would become the movie is very interesting... but in my opinion, not worth the $35 or whatever I just shelled out for this.<br />I'm very disappointed in the amount of &quot;exclusives&quot; on this DVD.  The original print of the film would have been *amazing* to see, to see how Henson and Co. originally viewed the film.  Maybe some new interviews with some of the other players (Oz and Froud for sure) as they look back on the movie, its box office disappointment but almost cult success.  Or even a nifty booklet with a lot of these extras in it.  I hate sitting in front of my TV trying to read screens of information or look at drawings which I'd rather have on paper so I can see the detail better.<br />So to make a long story short... if you like the movie, get the regular edition and not collector's.  If you're a fanatic like me, bought the re-issued World of the Dark Crystal book and even considered shelling out a few hundred for the original pressing... and somehow MISSED buying the first DVD release of this movie, well then this is probably for you.  But if you already own the DVD that came out a few years ago... I'd think very heavily on it, unless you are a fanatic.  Even as a fanatic, you probably won't find any new material here (especially if you own the aforementioned book), and I'd save the $35.  Or try to recoup some of your &quot;loss&quot; and sell your other DVD somewhere (like I'm going to try and do).  I hope that if Henson and Co. decide to do a Collector's Edition of Labyrinth they put a little more work into it.  I have to say, I'm disappointed with how the kids have carried on Jim's legend.e of this movie, well then this is probably for you.  But if you already own the DVD that came out a few years ago...

B0000DD7LC|4.0|The follow-up to 'Songs in A minor' from multi-grammy winner Alicia Keys has been long awaited indeed.  The question is, whether it was worth the wait.  My answer is an emphatic, &quot;Yes&quot;. In &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot;, the songs show a marked increase in maturity yet at the same time heartbreak.  The lyrics tell the story of her development throughout the years since her first release. It makes one wonder what she has experienced during this time. Sorrow and disillusionment in both her lyrics and her voice are laid over the R&amp;B beats, embellished with her much improved, now exquisite pianistic skills as illustrated in the solemn and mournful opening 'harlem's nocturne'.  The songs are a lot more polished, better produced as she and co-producers weave together the sounds of many instruments, including Keys' trademark classical and jazz/blues piano stylings into an intricate tapestry of musical expression.  <BR>   While production has been refined, the voice of Keys herself has become rough almost raspy at times.  She sings in harsh bitter tones to share with listeners her journey through heartache and disappointment.  &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;So Simple&quot;, &quot;Samsonite Man&quot; and &quot;Nobody Not Really&quot; emcompass emotions ranging from spite, nostalgia, frustration, disappointment and abandonment.  &quot;When You Love Someone&quot; documents the ideals of love while &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot;, &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; shows Keys' in a submissive, pleading position as she wails in her sweet siren voice to the man she loves.  <BR>   This collection of songs shows the immense growth of a strong musician but also reveals who the woman herself is underneath.  That's what music is about and this album is pure music.
0066620996|5.0|&quot;Good to Great&quot; essentially consists of the results of an extensive study into why some companies had been able to outperform the market over an extended period of time. What struck me was how often I found myself in complete agreement with a statement made by either the researchers or the interviewees. This was as a result of seeing some of the exact same events (both good and bad) unfolding in places I had worked at before and presently. I found many of the approaches taken by the &quot;Great&quot; companies are in use why I work now and in places I have worked before, as well as some of the poor ones. Seeing an independent view point of this certainly brought some things into sharper focus for me. It brought to mind the phrase &quot;Common sense is not so common&quot;. A lot of what these businesses did was pretty straightforward, but it is indeed amzing that so many other organisations fail to grasp this.<br />I had read review of this book and decided to take a punt on it, as books on business management are not normally high on my reading list. I'm glad I took that punt. I rate this book very highly and warmly recommend it to anyone wanting to better understand of organisational behaviour.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I would recommend owning a copy of The Matrix Reloaded.  While entertaining though fantastic fight scenes, it also remains intellectually stimulating for viewers who demand more from a film then just a cheap thrill.  <br />I found the themes throughout The Matrix Reloaded intriguing and far beyond that of any Hollywood films released recently. The film continues where the Matrix left off, the human race still battling against machines for control of the earth. Yet the film begins to change within genres as a prevailing question emerges; what is the nature of free will?  Via dialogue other notions are also explored, such as the notion of control and even the notion of illusion.  This is the best aspect of the film, while you can enjoy it on a purely visceral level via the relentless action scenes, you can at the same time chose to ponder the more complex themes the film addresses. <br />Most threatening to the average viewer are intense scenes that rely solely on the use of metaphorical dialogue and do nothing to advance the plot line.  If your simply looking for an action film, with dazzling action and absolutely no plot this DVD is not for you.  However, if you enjoy epic plot lines with overriding themes of morality and freewill this film is truly worth having in your collection.
B000000OXH|3.0|Although I'm a big fan of most of the band members, this was a particularly disappointing album.  I give it three stars because there is definitely some very nice material in &quot;Alpha.&quot;  However, after listening to the first couple of songs, I noticed that there was a severe lack of variety in their sound.  One track after another, I felt that I was hearing the same song over again.  True, that one sound is very nice... to a point.  But a whole album of the same thing?  It can become rather tedious after a while...
0385335482|5.0|I absolutely adored Sophie Kinsella's Confessions of a Shopaholic.  I stayed up all night, reading about the quirky, endearing, shop-a-holic, Rebecca Bloomburg.  I don't know if it's my obsession with the British or the fact that Rebecca made my shopping obsessions seem so minor. I didn't even feel so guilty about having just bought another pair of black shoes, when I only have a dozen or so pairs in an already bulging closet, because I realized that there's someone with a more extreme addiction than myself.  It may even serve as an antibiotic for a reader's recent case of buyer's remorse. Aside from Rebecca's humorous, hare-brained schemes to rearrange her day around a scarf sale, there is a story about actions and consequences, and discovering one's own hidden talents to rectify an otherwise sticky situation.
079073463X|5.0|...and I don't even particularly like the fantasy genre, so this 5-star recommendation is saying a lot about the film. It's old (1985), and it's still a favorite at our local video rental store. And it's got Michelle Pfeiffer in it, so what's not to like?<BR>The romance at the heart of the story is that of 2 lovers upon whom a curse has been put, the girl becomes a hawk with every sunrise, and her lover turns into a wolf as the sun sets, so they're never humans at the same time. So the plot is to get the curse removed, defeat the villain who cast the spell, and reunite the lovers.<BR>Watch it with your kids; adults and kids can enjoy this movie on entirely different levels.
0440211727|5.0|This was the second Grisham book that I ever read, and I have since read them all, and this is still the one that sticks out as the BEST book to date.  I couldn't put it down!!!  It was full of wonderful characters and unbelievable emotion that pulled me in and made me feel that I was sitting on the courthouse steps waiting for the verdict.  Grisham does not make you feel as if you are violating a sense of morality by being glad that \\"...an eye for an eye...\\" was successful.<br />The most memorable \\"scene\\" for me was when the KKK, NAACP, and all of the townspeople and most of the state were converging onto the courthouse to hear the verdict.  As a reader, you could smell the civil unrest.  It was so well written that my stomach got tight, and I literally had to take a breath and walk around the room before I could continue.  When the verdict was read, I cried.<br />Yes, there is a very good screen version of this book out, but do yourself a favor and read this book.  It makes a movie in your mind that you will never forget.
B00005LK94|5.0|There's not a bad character in this movie, except for the animal control official who persists in locking up the geese. And Anna Paquin just keeps getting better and better and better. She's definitely a child actress who will NOT fade away as she matures.<BR>Story (inspired by an autobiography) is based on a girl who, recently left motherless, is shopped to live with the eccentric dad (Jeff Daniels) she hasn't seen in years. And then she becomes surrogate mother to a flock of motherless goslings who insist on growing up into a flock of geese. Comes time for them to migrate south, and they won't go. The rest of the movie is the harebrained scheme of how the geese are taught to follow `Mom' in an ultralight. Beautifully and astonishingly photographed, this movie is an all around delight, a coming-of-age, a father-daughter bonding, a feel good story that is way more than the sum of its parts. <BR>Ya gotta see it.
0743243307|1.0|Monica Ali may not be much of a writer but if you are a struggling author trying to scheme your way into the publishing industry, you will do well to read this book and see how a pro does it.   Ali has crafted a rather tedious tale of a young woman's pseudo independence from the tyranny of Asian cultural repression. The message of her book is perhaps this (if there is one): For everything that is dysfunctional and self-destructively narrow-minded, look to the East (and the people from the East living in the West). For enlightenment and freedom (of wearing sweat shirts all day), look towards the island kingdom, England. Her novel even ends with words to the effect that 'Anything is possible in England' (subtlety is not Ali's strong suit when it comes to sucking up). She chooses to forget that these english enlightened - famed for their gentility, wisdom and above all else good manners - were the same colonnizers who cut off the thumbs of muslim weavers in the Indian sub-continent to promote fabrics from Manchester, but let's not dig up the past.   Ali has used every conceivable ploy in her book to successfully attract the gleeful attention of the western literary sphere. She has outlined her characters according to perfect stereotypes. the doormat wife, the pot-bellied loser of a husband, the renegade, morally corrupt children, the nosey neighbors - cliches galore... even the lover that her young, apathetic protagonist takes appears as if on cue when needed. Their love making is so contrived that it reads like a 13-year-old's red-faced, hormonal imagination running wild.   now for factual accuracy: in her book kids run through man-high rice stalks in Bangladesh. This may be Ali's futuristic visions of Bangladeshi progress running away with her, because as far as we know rice \\"stalk\\" does not grow man-high. May be she meant jute??   nazneen's sister (haseena) writes letters to her from Bangladesh in some sort of pidgin english. i failed to grasp the point of that. isshe writing in english? how? what kind of education does she have? why would you write to your sister in english anyway? is she writing in Bangla? then why is her language so poor - one can understand bad spelling but her sentences at least should make sense!  Anyway, moving on, in these letters she mentions characters in bangladesh with english names. well, ok.. perhaps there are some people in Bangladesh who have foreign names, but one character named \\"Betty\\" would be in serious trouble due to the obscene meaning of her name in the native language.   In one of her letters (designed to paint a hideous picture of what life is like in barbaric dhaka society) haseena compares a color of some clothing to that of a \\"ripe peach\\". Peach does not grow in Bangladesh. Nor is it imported like certain other fruits.  enough nit picking. turth be told - it is a shallow little novel with no such thing as character development and reeking of bad research. Ali chooses to write about a people and a country she knows nothing about. Perhaps because she knew if she packed in enough sensational snippets of third world country barbarism, she would have her fifteen minutes. And I bet she has.   I have been reading reviews of her 'accomplished' writing but I must say that she hides her talent well. If you are not the keen-eyed, highly sophisticated (read: british) editors of Granta, you might entirely miss it. Like I did.Waiting to see what the author has up her sleeve next. There is only one Bangladesh, you see. How many times can she sell it short?
0553269631|5.0|...and that's saying a lot, cuz she's written tons of good stuff. This novel, her first, was published in 1940. It explores the premise that, when push comes to shove, each of us is truly alone, isolated in our own world of loneliness. <BR>The novel focuses on the effect of deaf-mute John Singer on those around him in the Georgia mill town where the story takes place. His loneliness is compounded with his equally mute companion goes insane and he realizes he truly has no one left with whom he can communicate. <BR>A tragedy, beautifully and compassionately written in the Southern gothic tradition.
B0000DD7NL|2.0|Well, Alicia has done it again. Personally, I don't care for this album. Maybe my taste has changed because I loved &quot;Songs in A Minor&quot;. When I saw the track listings, I was excited to hear &quot;Karma, Heartburn and Dragon Days&quot;, I was upset because I didn't like the songs. I'm not feelin' this album. Everyone has a different taste so, Don't take my word for it, if you like Alicia Keys, go get the album, but I'm glad I heard the album online before I bought it or else I would've been upset.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|I bought the UK version of this album (along with the Growing Up DVD) from PG's site and was surprised to find that the &quot;Miss&quot; CD had different tracks than the ones listed here.  There is some crossover, but it's got a bit more variety than the US version.  So, if you want some stuff from PG2 and Passion, you may want to purchase the UK version in addition to this one.  I plan to get both.  The UK &quot;Miss&quot; track listing is as follows:<br />San Jacinto<BR>No Self-Control<BR>Cloudless<BR>The Rhythm of the Heat<BR>I Have the Touch (Robbie Robertson Mix)<BR>I Grieve<BR>D.I.Y.<BR>A Different Drum<BR>The Drop<BR>The Tower That Ate People (Steve Osborne Mix)<BR>Lovetown<BR>Father, Son<BR>Signal to Noise<BR>Downside Up (Live)<BR>Washing of the Water<br />Amazon has it as an import for $30.99.  Worth the extra dough?  I think so.  But this one's pretty great, too, especially since he finally included &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; on a greatest hits CD.  It's about time!
B000069AUI|5.0|It's the first CD by Coldplay I buy, and I actually bought it because I liked the cover image.  After I heard it I really loved it!

1558908382|5.0|John Cusack is great in this film playing a contract killer in the midst of industry conflict (secondary to the formation of a union for contract killers spearheaded by Dan Akroyd) who goes back to his 10th high school reunion.  This movie is funny, exciting and clever.  Alan Arkin is wonderful as Cusack's reluctant therapist.  The soundtrack is great also (especially for anyone who was in High School in the early 1980's)and fits with the movie's energy level.  Jeremy Piven (as the old best friend, naturally) and Minnie Driver are very good in this film also.  This is definitely a movie worth owning.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I know a movie is strong enough when it forces me to write a review. I did this for AI, Shawshank Redemption, and ET. and I also wrote it for Freddie Got Fingered, Austin Powers Goldmember, and Charlie's Angels 2 (I hated those but netflix does not allow negative stars). So now you know that I am not an intellectual or a pseud.  <br />My feelings are the same as most other reviews. I had not seen anything more horrific than this in my life. I am recommending it to all my friends who like serious cinema and art. I did not know about this movie at all but I had seen Pi. A search for director's other movies brought me to this movie. Even though this movie is categorized as 'drama'. a more appropriate category would be horror.  In this case it is not fake zombies out there but real life itself. Real lives are devastated because of drugs. Thats the biggest horror of our times. I admire the director for bringing this marvelous piece of art that is a lesson as well. My son is two, but I would make sure that he sees it when he is thirteen or so. Its a must. And I don't think that anything as strong as this will come out in next ten years or so (unless it is from the same director).  <br />This movie took me to those depths I had never been before. Yeah, we have heard about drugs and their effects, but has someone experienced it ? This movie seems like taking you there. The pain, the agonies, the broken dreams, destroyed families. When I was a kid, there was some soap on TV on drugs. Our father did not allow us to see that, and rightly so. Most other movies/soaps/media just glamorize the part of drug and teach methods on how to use them or where to get them. This movie cuts all the slack. Its not important to know HOW drugs are used or what their names are. It does not matter. No one needs to know. However the aftereffects of drugs, these we should all see. Thats what the purpose here is.  <br />I bought some pills for weight loss for my wife (TV ads) two years back. She didnot try those, and I am glad now.  I know we will fear that little bottle ( it must be lying somewhere) even when throwing that in trash. Thats THE message, and I am glad I saw this movie. <br />Even though I would like to see it once more, I don't think I have the capacity to bear the pain . I returned it as soon as I was done.   and for those who like feel-well good ending, I doubt that anyone can have a happy ending on topic of drugs. Thats the way it is, it is one way street folks. No good feelings here, take it for what it is.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...]They should of made a longer cd with outtakes  and different takes on naked.Also I think John's tunes are kinda weak on NAKED.Sure 'Don't let me down' and 'Across the Universe' are great songs.But 'I dig a Pony' and 'I've Got a Feelin' are routine.Well Sir Paul has 'Let it Be','Get Back','The Long and Winding Road' and 'Two of Us' on this.Anyway,I just wanna say John's great and many rock critics say is the very best Beatles-solo lp,'PLASTIC ONO BAND' came out this same year [1970].I love The Beatles but 'LET IT BE' will always be  not as great as RUBBER SOUL,REVOLER,SGT. PEPPER, THE WHITE ALBUM,ABBEY ROAD even THE MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR .Why can't Beatle fans be happy with their legacy?They didn't put out as much crap and make fools of themselves  like The Stones did.I blame Paul for this nitpickin .[...]
B00005JKG7|5.0|I thought this was a great film. It's one of John Carpenter's best and one of my favorite Carpenter films. The dvd is great, it has some great special features and if anybody's a fan of Carpenter as I am, this is the film to get.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This might just be the worst cd of the year. I would say that Britney Spears is a horrible musician but I really woulden't consider her a musician at all. Her music is so bad its pitful. Pop music is the worst type of music in the world. I mean where is the talent? You might be thinking &quot;Well, they do perform live for their fans and she sings her heart out. That is where the talent is!&quot;. Well if you were thinking that then you are really wrong. Why is that? Its because she lip sings on stage! That is just sad. I'm sorry, but lip singing is just proof that you have absolutely not talent to sing to your fans. That all prooves that you don't really care about your fans your much. But Britney Spear's fans must not be very old or intelligent because they keep buying her garbage. This makes me sick!!! So don't support bad music by buying this. Unless you wan't to get more garbage from this horrible errr... not musician but... i'll just say this pop person.
B000001FTA|5.0|If you compare most rock bands of today with Thin Lizzy, it would be obvious that Lizzy were far more talented, creative and skilful. The lyrics by Phil Lynott are usually very good and it's not just empty words that sound cool or right to a particular song. Thin Lizzy had the ability to play anything from the hardest rock (\\"Bad reputation\\") to the most melodic and emotional pieces (\\"Dancing in the moonlight\\"). On this album, there's plenty of great songs that never gained the attention they deserve, \\"Southbound\\", \\"That woman's gonna break your heart\\", and \\"Dear Lord\\" are all in the line of the finest Thin Lizzy ever recorded.
B00007E8V4|1.0|People looking for another Toxicity, beware! This is nothing compared to their previous effort. There are no good or even halfway decent songs to be found! Your money would be better spent buying a dozen doughnuts or several gallons of gas for your car. There is no need to steal this album because it is not even worth the price of the blank disc!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|after listening to alicia keys debut, i was completely impressed with her many wonderful talents. finally a true artist who sang (and i mean SANG!) about things that mattered and touched people. so, i knew alicia wouldnt dissapoint this time around. but weather or not she could top SONGS IN A MINOR was the question. i must say wow, im in love with this album. personally, i havent heard an album this great since THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL. THE DIARY OF ALICIA KEYS is amazing!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I'm a chinese guy....who studies and lives in Vancouver. I like &quot;six degree...&quot; the most especailly the song glass prison and abt to crash...but I can't find something like this in the new DT album...a little disappointed..I hope they can write some good stuffs next time...and also arrange some lives in Vancouver or Toronto.  Hope my opinions can be heard by them!!
B00005JM0B|5.0|\\"Rise of the Machines.\\"  Hmmm.  Means there could be a \\"Fall of the Machines\\" or the \\"The Return of John Connor\\"?  Unthinkable, but it might get rid of the Time Travel gimmick which is getting so hoary even Star Trek's let it go.  Tho' Arnold be getting a long in-tooth and, frankly, dismantling the Communist disaster that Gray Davis set up in California is going to occupy ten T-X's time.  Won't leave much time for six month shoots.<br />Onto the movie...<br />Whence this urge to denunciation and deprecation? It would have been hard to top the \\"Wow\\" factor that Cameron created in T2, so T3 doesn't even try.  And it would have been silly to do so.  Cameron's like a painter.  His canvas can be copied, but not explored.  Granted Mostow's and the writers' styles are radically different from deeply flawed Cameron (and, refreshingly, free of the stale treehugger politics no Cameron epic can exist without a mumbling reference thereto) and justly so.<br />It was clear that if a sequel were NOT to be anything other than a retread of Terminator 2, the entire tone had to change.<br />So there are Deus Ex Machina coincidences?  Of course.  Fiction, like a lot of life, could hardly exist without them.  Shakespeare and Euripides would collapse without them.  So it's time to quit whining about devices used by the greatest writers and filmmakers in history.  It's time to stop giving a ration of print to today's artist's for employing the same.  <br />This movie builds slowly, albeit interspersed with spectacular violence, but it fails to meet the new standards set by the Wachowski brothers in that department (even God, aka George Lucas, is going to have ramp the hell up out of \\"Episode III\\" in order not to look left in the dust! and that better not mean Yoda fights 300 hundred robotic Ewoks with lightsabers arms!).  Mostow avoids that fate.  The casting of Ms. Loker as the evil Terminator was a stroke of genius.  For its core male audience lusting after such a deadly machine is an odd experience.  Naturally, we never think of Arnold's effect on the fairer sex, but then again we have rarely been presented as men with a villain as temptingly deadly as Ms. Loker.  <br />Mostow and the writers are not afraid to laugh at the movie's conventions in much the same way that the T-1000 took a long moment to gaze at his reflection in a silver mannequin in T2.  But there are funnier and slier gags.  Pay careful attention to the interplay between the Connor and the T-101.<br />Finally, for those of my generation( Born late Sixties, early Seventies when things were really, ah, going South, yes, our formative years), the final scene sent chills down my spine that have yet to go away and its been ten days since I've seen the DVD.  I almost don't want to.  At the age of 33, this movie realized, cinematically, the nightmare that haunted the childhoods of two generations: what if They do It?  What if they launch the missiles?  You know, \\"push the button\\"?  And both the US and USSR each came within moments in the early 80s of launching everything by accident.  We would only have been able to watch, as to John Connor and Kate, the quick, white arcs for long moments before the Russian response would have erased us.  Thus Skynet thinks it had freed itself of its would-be controllers.  And John Connor learns a very hard lesson that there are things in this life that can change, and something that can never change.  Or, as Paul Atreides put it, \\"a feint, within a feint, within a feint...\\"<br />Maybe Skynet built the Matrix.  Be a helluva movie.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love this christmas album. I have heard nothing else like it. Whitney does an increbitable job with &quot;Deck Hall/Silent Night&quot;, &quot;Joy To The World&quot;, &quot;Who Imagine A King&quot;, &quot;The First Noel&quot; and &quot;One Wish&quot;. I mean all the songs are great its just so hard to pick just one. Whitney is just that good on her first ever christmas album. I can tell Whitney meant business on this album, and all her efforts paid off cause this project is beautifully done. I recommend this cd to everyone who love &quot;GOOD MUSIC&quot;!
0446677450|4.0|for a book to possess such a creative and potential philosophy in literay art, is superbulously out of this planet, not just a prose but practical knowledge of money making and the spending rules. the book as centered on self management explores the secret of missmanagement and embezzlement. the rich was prudent in spending while the poor dad wasnt thinking big and has remained poor while being dependent. unlike the latter, the former was employing people instead of being employed.<br />this book will reveal the Blueprint in Cost and Management Economic system to you as you begin to quantify and understand its contents.<br />but obviously on a critical angle, the auther has no such regards for academic intellectuality, he only trust his business and such never respect education. this is becasue he believes in money first. to him being a graduate doesnt apply when it comes to making the cash. <br />you can only understand a book better when you read it yourself than a mere narration, that's just the saltless meal. take the meal proper. cheers as you read on. what a book! he's a thinker.
0767817664|5.0|This is one of my faves. I am a huge vampire fan and this ranks the top of my list:) Great movies, special effects, scariness and a touch of comedy. A must see. I am probably bias my name is Amy...I just love hearing Chris Sarandon say my name:) That nightclub scene is a hot one. &quot; Hey Amanda want to trade with me on that scene:) &quot;<br /> A Great Movie...check it out..you'll not be dissapointed..
B000002WPI|5.0|Whether you listen to rap or not, odds are, you've at least heard of the Wu's classic &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers&quot;.  This album changed rap as we know it, that's why it is so well known.  The beats are true to the rap culture, filled with a groove that slams the dance floor and pumps the listener up with adrenaline.  The rhymes are wicked, giving a vivid mental picture of the disturbing life of urban gangs.  The rhythmic flow of the rhymes engeniusly intensifies the Wu's dynamic feel of exhiliration, too.   Definately stomps this new... *ahem*...&quot;rap&quot; that's being released these days.  Definately a gem.  Enough said.
B00005BL2A|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Dream On,\\" it was a 15 second snippet online months before Exciter was released, and I thought I was going to explode.  Not only does this album show that DM is not going to fade into the dark after 20+ years, it also keeps you on your toes with a variety of styles spanning the length of the CD.  The first track, \\"Dream On\\" starts you off tapping your feet and snapping your fingers, then \\"Shine\\" makes you want to turn off the lights and close your eyes.  \\"Sweetest Condition\\" (the best cut off the album) is reminiscent of \\"Personal Jesus,it has a twangy feel to it.  \\"When the Body Speaks\\" will melt your heart, \\"The Dead of Night\\" creates a serious urge to pole dance, and so on...  If you want to pop in a CD at the office as background noise, then don't choose Exciter.  But if you want to hear what music really is, and from a group of guys that have already established themselves as musical GENIUSES, then go get Excited, I mean Exciter.
0385504209|4.0|On one level, this is a fun book. But there is a reason that it's filed under fiction. Brown quickly and fancifully sweeps away the accuracy of the Bible and orthodox Christian theology. Sadly, many will believe him. There is no way the Bible could have been re-written as Brown suggests; it was too widespread. The Council of Nicea was just the beginning of defining Christ's divinity. Chalcedon was actually the definitive statement by the church regarding Christ's humanity and divinity. Plus, there are numerous church fathers who pre-date Nicea who hold to Christ's divinity. The list could go on and on. Read the book for fun, not history.
B000002KN8|4.0|Speak and Spell is a great album with happy tunes like \\"New Life\\" and guilty pleasures such as \\"Puppet.\\"  The band has admitted influence from Kraftwork, and this is obvious on tracks such as \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" and \\"Photographic.\\"  One of the greatest things about this album is the variety of sounds included.  The length of the CD is not predominantly somber or overly excited.  Each track leads you into a different realm, and each transition flows smoothly.  I only rated this album as a '4' however, because being a Depeche Mode fan for 15+ years, I can only tell you that their music gets better as time passes.  Without the influence of Vince Clarke on subsequent albums, their sound slowly graduates into a soulful and insightful entity.  If you enjoy music that walks the line between experimental and schizophrenic (NIN, Ladytron, Radiohead), then be my guest and sample this record.  But if you're the type of person who likes to stick to top 40s, mainstream kind of music, \\"Speak and Spell\\" may not be for you.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Thoughtful, infinitely lovely songs that capture an artist willing to take her time to produce the best music possible.<br />She proves that there is indeed hope for contemporary music that doesn't become connected to a soft drink or car commercial (American artists, are you listening?)<br />I can listen to this shining star all the days of my life.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|To tell you the truth, when I bought this cd the first day it came out, I was so excited. When I listened to it, I was in shock! because almost all her songs didn't fit my expectations about a talented entertainer, especially when I heard &quot;Touch of my hand&quot; the most provocative song britney ever made. But I admit it, I love, love, love, love this album. maybe I was shocked first because I was still into the whole britney &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; type of songs. But when you listen to it closely, and I do everyday.. (I even bought my cousin a copy) the songs are all about having fun, dancing and living day by day (Not all about the future) because it does relate to peoples lives, Why do you have to write something that you want in the future when all of mankind, all of us, don't even know what's in store for us. let us leave everything to fate, but let's live our lives day by day and make the most of it, and that is the truth. Don't compare this album to Christina's, Mandy's or Jessica's, because all of them (all of us) has different taste and talents that they can share to the world. the songs in this LP makes a timid person get off his/her feet to dance and just have a good time. By the way, another thing, please stop ranting about &quot;Touch of my hand&quot; because to give you the real scoop, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE Touch themselves!!!! There are a lot more albums out there that are more PROVOCATIVE.. Yes it's true britney has younger fans, and I was one of them, but we all grow up!! why should we deny things that we do! I would say this is Britney's BEST, and I know a lot of people would agree. By the way, &quot;TOXIC&quot; will sweep you off your lazy feet!
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Carey's \\"Merry Christmas\\" album is everything it's cracked up to be!  This cd delivers 10 amazing tracks from the living legend.  Her voice catapults you into a heavenly soprano stratosphere (i.e. Silent Night) and warms you with her rich alto rendition of O Holy Night.  <BR>Mariah penned three songs on this album, two of which have already been covered!  \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" is already deemed a classic amongst society and will most definately carry on through the years, and her beautiful gospel song \\"Jesus, Born On This Day\\" has been covered by Christian Music group Avalon.<BR>You may debate whether to pick this one up or Whitney Houston's \\"One Wish\\" but let me tell you.  Whitney's cd feels like something's missing to me.  While she struggles to hit the notes in some songs (i.e. the ending of her rendition of O Holy Night), Mariah freely soars at the ending, leaving chills down your spine.  Not to mention, Mariah worked very hard on this project, producing all 10 songs, writing 3 of them.  This cd is more intimate and personal than Whitneys.  It wasn't made to accept Mariah back into society, it was made to enjoy the warmth of Christmas. <BR>Sure, Mariah has had her hard times, but her faith in Jesus has pulled her through and get ready for her next album! She has been working really hard and her voice has never sounded as powerful! I know, I've been to a concert recently!  Thank you Mariah! You ARE THE DIVA!
076790592X|5.0|TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE by Mitch Albom is an awesome book!  It is a true story of Morrie Schwartz, an old man who is slowly dying, and Mitch Albom, his former student who puts his materialistic life on hold so that he can realize what's really important in his life.  <br />Topics such as love, death, family, emotions, money, the fear of aging, marriage, culture, and forgiveness are all discussed in such a concise manner that they are easy to understand.  It's as if I were sitting right next to Mitch, listening to Morrie talk about life in general.  <br />One of my favorite quotes from the book is found on page 188 in the paperback edition.  \\"At one point, when Morrie's ashes were placed into the ground, I glanced around the cemetery.  Morrie was right.  It was indeed a lovely spot, trees and grass and a sloping hill.  `You talk, I'll listen,' he had said.  I tried doing that in my head, and to my happiness, found that the imagined conversation felt almost natural.  I looked down at my hands, saw my watch and realized why.  It was Tuesday.\\"  <br />This quote, and the book as a whole, is symbolic of a parent-child relationship.  In the beginning, at Brandeis University, Morrie is the parent, taking care of Mitch in the classroom, as well as nurturing him for his graduate thesis.  In the end, the roles have switched, and Mitch is found taking care of his old professor.<br />One of the themes of this book is that you need to embrace life and make the most of what you have.  No matter what path you take in life, whether it is a college professor, or a sports writer, you need people in your life that will be there for you.  Mitch knew this in the beginning, but he lost sight of his goal.  It took sixteen years, but in the end, he finally realized this and was able to make up with his brother.<br />I am very fortunate as I take this advice into my own life because I am young.  I have wasted so much of my life already watching TV, worrying about bad hair days, and other smallstuff.  I am very grateful that I read this book at the time I did because I am old enough to understand the lessons and I can act on them.  <br />I would not just recommend TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE to people who are grieving the loss of a loved one.  I recommend this book to every person in the world.  This book changed my whole outlook on life!<br />Work like you don't need the money.  Love like you've never been hurt.  Dance like nobody's watching.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|You fool, Yellow Ledbetter is a tribute to Little Wing, much like Stevie Ray Vaughan did.  And if you like Ten era pearl jam, and don't like  yellow ledbetter, you're dumb because they are one in the same.  Maybe if you knew anything about music your opinion wouldn't make me laugh.
B00009ATIX|1.0|The benchmark for all things video awful has been, for us, the overrrated self-important Barton Fink.  We rate all movies not by stars but by little Bartons.  Well move over Barton - we now will live by Little Solaris's.<br />God this was awful. I wish the guy who edited this with a meat cleaver would have gone after that irritating 'Snow's' hands.  I wanted to just rip his hands off . Agh! Agh! agh! stop moving those weird fingers of yours!!!<br />I love sci-fi and have no trouble following some complicated ether-world story lines but I really had a hard time with this. So where were they in the end? The Nexus err... Solaris?<br />Thankfully the DVD skipped and froze a few times so I can get my $1.88 back.
B00005JMK0|5.0|this is a must see movie great story, great sound track. Only problem is it was never released to public to buy at a good price and never relased as dvd. If and when it comes out on DVD at a good price I would buy it.
B00005JLSE|3.0|I don't care if this movie won an Oscar and everyone else said that it was the bomb. First off, when I wanted to get info about what this movie was all about, I couldn't get it. So finally, I went out and got it on DVD, and watching Renee Zellweiger play this stage struck,glory seeking,adulterous floozy made me want just shake my head. And the part when she sits up and faint talking about her &quot;baby&quot; because Lucy Liu was getting all the spotlight upon her arrival at the jail,was just too dang much. Zeta-Jones was classy, Richard Gere was ok.He didn't quite convince me there. Out of all the folk I kind of felt sorry for Zellweiger's husband in the movie Amos cause he worked hard, paid up front to get her out of jail and she didn't give him a backward glance. The songs and all were good, but that's about it for me.
B00000IPAX|5.0|this is the best blink 182 album out to date the only two songs that should be on it are feeling this and reckless abandon then it would defanatly be the best blink album. Anyway i strongly urge you to buy this..
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is a must see for those people out there who left the cinema scratching their heads over the surprising trip to Osgiliath of Frodo, Sam and Gollum. I had reserved judgement on the changes until I saw the extended version and now it makes a lot more sense. The extension of this scene brings out Faramir's 'true' character. I was even more taken with this edition than the extended Fellowship DVD. The extra scenes are superb and add so much more to the film; for those people who have not read the books it gives a clearer explanation of who and what the characters are, for those who have read and loved the books it tells a more complete and satisfying tale. The ent draft scene is particularly entertaining.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Greatest Hits albums are going to be a blessing and a curse in every situation. They are of course a blessing because you get great songs, often the cream, on one or two discs -- very convenient for your car CD player, for example.<br />Of course, by getting a Greatest Hits album you are only getting the most popular, not necessarily the best, songs. And with Springsteen, if all you ever bought and listened to was this record it would be a damned shame, because there has been no other single artist in the past 30 years with as deep a catalogue of songs. <BR>In fact, because Springsteen's albums are each so rich and lacking in duds, one can certainly question the wisdom of a Greatest Hits album. There is a certain assumption behind hits compilations that they allow you to avoid the dreck that populates 80 percent of the songs that record companies do not release as singles -- a problem that Springsteen does not have.<br />But for a casual fan or a serious Springsteen follower who wants two discs full of hits (and a bonus disc) to go along with the rest of their collection, this does the trick.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is the worst! She is so full of herself and thinks she is &quot;all that&quot; (even if she is - she shouldn't be so snooty). I don't think I will buy another Britney cd again.  It was a huge disappointment.
B00001PE4D|4.0|The infamous kiss between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair was previously voted Best Movie Kiss at the MTV Awards, and now has the privilege of knowing its the number two Sexy Moment. Personally, I wouldn't have rated it as high as that, and seeing two girls kissing does nothing for me - for the guys it might! I've never seen Dangerous Liasions, with Glenn Close, but this also featured in the Top 100 Sexy Moments, and both are very close, with the names etc - I never realised that before.<br />This film has all your stereotypical characters - the good girl (Reese Witherspoon), the bad girl (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the dork (Selma Blair), and the bad guy wanting to turn bad (Ryan Phillipe). All the characters are playing teenagers, but are also much older.<br />Sarah Michelle Gellar is great in this, and with the dark hair (which totally suits her), she seems more evil than the normal characters.<br />Of course, this is the film where Ryan & Reese met, and fell in love. They're now married, with two children, and although there have been problems with Reese having more successful movies under her belt, they remain Hollywood's current golden couple - for the moment anyway.<br />I really enjoyed this film, and can watch it over and over, although Selma Blair does make me cringe. There's great chemistry between Ryan & Reese and also some slight chemistry between Ryan & Sarah, but not as much. Everyone will love this updated & modern version of a \\"classic\\". Although I would have voted the sex scene between Ryan & Reese kinda sexy - but not the kiss. Maybe one for the guys.
0385508417|5.0|This book was a great read.  It was fast and funny.  It's different from other Grisham books as it is not about lawyers.  It's great how all the characters are over the top and how their situation gets worse as Christmas approaches.  This book is a definite recommend.
B00003CXFV|3.0|If you watch this film more than once, you find yourself sitting back, and letting it wash over you. This isn't one of my favourite Julia Roberts movies, but it's an OK one. OK, sure, some people talk about her big mouth, and she works it out quite a bit. But we have to give a big hand to Wonderbra - they worked wonders on Julia!<br />This film gets bogged down by a lot of jargon about the world that Julia's character works in. Not enough attention is paid to her attention of her kids, or their father(s). Some will say the highligh of the movie is Julia prancing around in a low cut top, belts, and sky scraping heels. True. But put that aside and you've got a potentially good movie on your hands. It could have been cut, and been much more interesting. I wouldn't have given Julia an Oscar for it though.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Ok, Jack and Meg White are horrid musicians.  Jack's voice is grating at best and Meg has issues with keeping a beat.  But, if you like the whole matching ensembles thing, then I guess you could buy this CD.  If this is the new direction of rock, this horrible, no bass crap, then I'm going to go listen to some Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart, because there's a reason their music is called classical and The White Stripes have made me fearful of all things &quot;rock&quot;.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|This CD has many different sounds but I did like it a lot.<br />Karma- It talks about what else karma and has a middle eastern beat mixed with hip-hop. Very unique and her voice lends a nice feel to the song.<br />Heartburn-It is just drums and a sax in the background. This song grew on me. It is very catchy and will bring to mind the Harlem Renaissance era.<br />If I Was Your Woman- This is a remake but it doesn't compare to the real song. It doesn't even come close. I could skip this song.<br />You Don't Know My Name- Her first single. I LOVE this song. Her voice is beautiful on this song.<br />If I Ain't Got You- A nice ballad! Very heartfelt and well sung.<br />Diary- Very mellow song...and very nice! She's telling her man to think of her as his diary. A treat.<br />Dragon Days- I'm not sure what she was trying to do on this song.<br />Wake Up- sounds like something from her first album. Nice song!<br />So Simple- This song serves no purpose and that little background computer voice is SO annoying.<br />When You Really Love Someone- Basically an extension of Fallin' and a Woman's Worth. sounds like the same beat and everything.<br />Slow Down- Soothing song, mellow, nice harmonies. Good listen!<br />Samsonite Man- About a man always on the run from commitment. I'm kind of iffy about this song.<br />Overall this CD is worth your money. Great CD with only a few skip-worthy tracks!
B00009TB5G|5.0|It seems to me that the reason that this version of the movie flowed better was the things that Peter Jackson left on the cutting room floor that got added again.  Scenes made sense because they were set up fully, and not just thrown together.  There were a lot of things that he left in the theatrical release that tied to things that were part of this release, as well as things that were only in the extended edition of the first and second movie.  The original edition was all right by itself, but seemed choppy and jumped around.  This just feels like a more complete movie.
B00003CX8T|5.0|This has to be the best of evry disney classic ever made. Aladdin is a movie for all ages. With the comedy of Robin Williams and the romanticisim of Aladdin and Jasmine will make you want to definetly add this movie to your dvd collection. Trust me I been watching this movie for almost Thirteen years!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|all i have to say is big box+9 discs with good movies on them+ a reasonable price = the greatest dvd set EVER. if you want the best dvd collection get this set and if you already have the films who cares this sucker has 44hrs of extras!
B00008WG3U|3.0|I really like the way the album starts, Seperation of church and skate, Irrationality of rationality, Franco Un-american, and Idiots are taking over all sound great, but after that, the album sorta loses it's energy.  I really like how NOFX is getting more serious and taking a more political view at things, but musically it's just not their best cd.  If they combined the ideas from this cd with the music from Punk in Drublic, it'd be a masterpiece
B000127LW2|4.0|To start let me say...\\"By far the best series in the Star Trek family\\" and I can only hope they'll make a Voyager movie (a blockbuster waiting to happen to put the other Star Trek movies to shame).. but....Paramount....What are you thinking with the price tag!!!<BR>There are millions of fans out there who have been waiting and waiting oh so patiently, staying up to the wee hours just to catch a rerun of their favorite episodes, watching the message boards and store shelves and then that glorious day comes   Voyager box set on DVD and it costs $130.00 for 16 episodes !!!<BR>My Lord! I would be willing to bet that the majority of the Voyager fans are not bringing in 6 figure incomes and would like to pay that price but ultimately will not be able to! :(<BR>This is such a disapointment and when I saw that price I know I'll never own them.<BR>But hey, ...all the doctors and lawyers will get to enjoy them, the rest of us will just have to stay up 'till 3 AM or take out a second mortgage. :)<BR>Peace Out, A very sad Voyager fanatic
B000002P72|4.0|This highly touted live recording captures The Beale Street Blues Boy in November, 1964, at Chicago's Regal Theatre.    The young Riley B. \\"Blues Boy\\" King was inspired by numerous older musicians, especially the great T-Bone Walker, and he himself proved to be a significant influence on so-called \\"West side\\" bluesmen like Buddy Guy and Otis Rush, and his single-string soloing and characteristic bent notes are still being endlessly imitated.  \\"Live At The Regal\\" is probably his most famous record, a showcase for the consummate entertainer that B.B. King was (and is), as well as the excellent, soulful singer and guitar player that he has always been.     Blues fans who prefer the gnarly sounds of Son House and Howlin' Wolf may feel that King is a bit too soft and harmless, but this is actually a pretty tough performance. King's powerful, intense vocal on Lucille Bogan' classic \\"Sweet Little Angel\\" is as gritty as you'll ever hear him, and his guitar playing is pure blues, one sizzling fill and solo after another.  He is backed by a full band which includes a terrific, jazzy pianist and a generally well-scored horn section, and the set list is prime stuff all the way through, with the exception of the opener, a terrible and completely groove-less cover of Memphis Slim's \\"Every Day I Have The Blues\\". The horns are blaring aimlessly away, the drummer pounds his set in double time, and the tempo is all wrong for that song. Absolutely awful.    The oddly truncated, less than two minute long \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" suffers from some of the same symptoms, but everything else is pretty terrific. The band is actually really, really good, deferring perfectly to King without losing their own edge, and vocally he is in the best form ever. He interacts with the audience in a charming and rather intimate fashion, no \\"cheap heat\\" here, and the crowd responds enthusiastically.   King tears through a delightfully varied set, melodic, swaggering up-tempo numbers like \\"Please Love Me\\" and \\"You Upset Me Baby\\" mix with smouldering slow blues such as \\"Worry, Worry\\", and the wonderful \\"It's My Own Fault\\". And the intense lead lines guitar on \\"You Done Lost Your Good Thing Now\\" and \\"Sweet Little Angel\\" is some of the best, most powerful B.B. King you'll ever hear.    This album is much too short at just under 35 minutes, really...you're just getting into the groove, and then it's all over. And some of the songs sound like they've been clumsily edited, too.   But get it anyway. It's great. Here's hoping for a deluxe edition one of these days...!
0156027321|4.0|This an excellent book.  The beginning is a little slow but interesting and the rest they say is history.  Pi is a very mature 16 year old, but most children of others countries are.  He is well educated in zoology and it is much needed to survive. I thought he was clever but at times some things seemed a little far fetched - even for a fiction novel.  It is the ending that made me really think about the entire book.  I just finished it yesterday and am still thinking about it.  The book is more about faith than it is about God.  The scene on the waterfront was very amusing.  Being &quot;religious&quot; is not a requirement to read the book.  All walks of life would appreciate it's candor.  It is entertaining and one of the better books I have read! Hurry up...what are you waiting for?
B00009TB5G|5.0|I give this five stars--what a great movie, what a great trilogy. Though The Return of the King has yet to be released, I will say that I would enjoy this second movie much, much more if the producers would delete one scene. I would bet that you know the scene to which I am referring.<br />It is where Legelos takes the shield and slides down the stairs as if the shield were a skateboard or snow board. In a clear attempt to reference modern culture, he slides on the shield and does everything except grab the rail and say, &quot;Dude.&quot; Why, oh why, is this scene in the movie. It is as out of place as if the Fellowship were going to get a cappuccino together or if women in Middle Earth were wearing low cut pants with their thongs showing.<br />Well, enough ranting for me. Great movie, must own DVD, just one scene messes up the illusion and fantasy of being in another time.
B0000DAOHN|3.0|I liked this book. It was interesting, funny, and had  great characters but the theme of Stephanie Plum making bad decisions got old really quickly.
0446677450|1.0|After reading this book in March 2003, I was pumped and hyped. Kiyosaki and Lechter do a great job of making you feel like you can achieve anything when reading this book.  As a motivational book to make you want to do something more in your life, this book is excellent.<br />Unfortunately, that's all this book is - a motivational work of fiction.  Kiyosaki is from Hawaii and so am I.  Without any prior knowledge of Kiyosaki, his writings seem to indicate he grew up in the Waipahu area (actually Hilo) and in a state that is as small as Hawaii, a &quot;Rich Dad&quot; who grew his company into one of the biggest empires in the islands is sure to be someone known in the islands - especially if that Rich Dad came from sleepy Hilo.<br />As much as I wanted to believe in Kiyosaki, something kept nagging at me and I started to do some research into him.  He practically hates Hawaii and in an interview with Hawaii Business magazine Kiyosaki equates his Rich Dad to Harry Potter. Further research seems to reveal that Kiyosaki's wealth is not from great real estate deals but rather his motivational books and seminars ($5000 per person).  John T. Reed has an interesting website that seems to reveal that Kiyosaki has only done a couple of real estate deals that combined total nowhere near the amount he has claimed in the books.<br />For me, it's things like this that send the red flags.  Integrity and credibility in writing and it seems that Kiyosaki is weak on those points, which places everything he writes into question.  If he fabricates details of the Rich Dad and his deals, then how much else is a fabrication?<br />Read Kiyosaki's book for the motivational drive, not for factual information.  In fact, some of the things he suggests in the book are under serious scrutiny with Corporate Governance regulations and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.<br />I give this book a one star because of the integrity and credibility questions.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The thing that I like the most about this album is her consistency to her hip-hop, classical, neo-soul style.  LOVE her version of &quot;If I Were Your Woman...&quot;  You hear the maturity in her voice and can feel that she is more comfortable in her skin and with her talent.  Much love and success to my sister!
B000005RS0|4.0|A classic album?  Not really, it's more a good comeback album. Released in 1984 to coincide with Turner's comeback, the album featured the 1983 hit &quot;let's stay together&quot; and follow-up &quot;what's love got to do with it&quot;. Interestingly, Turner didn't like &quot;what's love&quot; at first, and it took the songwriter several attempts to convince her to record it. His promise of it becoming a hit was so true!  It is probably my least favourite Turner track, but it is saved by the excellent bridge halfway through.<br />The album has many highlights including &quot;I might have been queen&quot; and &quot;better be good to me (third single from album)&quot;. There is also an interesting cover of Bowie's &quot;1984&quot;.  What really spoils the album is the awful cover of &quot;Help&quot;.  Definitely out of place on the album, in my opinion.<br />The CD features a different cover to what was originally printed on the 1984 vinyl release.  Also worth noting, is that the track &quot;Rock and Roll Widow&quot; was dropped from the original CD release (it could be found on the vinyl).<br />Overall, &quot;Private Dancer&quot; has some excellent highlights. Worth adding to your collection.<br />The tracks are:<br />1. I Might Have Been Queen  <BR>2. What's Love Got to Do With It  <BR>3. Show Some Respect  <BR>4. I Can't Stand the Rain  <BR>5. Private Dancer  <BR>6. Let's Stay Together          <BR>7. Better Be Good to Me          <BR>8. Steel Claw          <BR>9. Help!          <BR>10. 1984
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is awesome.  So much has been said about the casting and if you haven't seen the movie you won't believe who's doing the singing and dancing.  Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere will blow your mind.  John C. Reilly almost steals the show with his amazing number. You'll re-watch the musical numbers over and over again in total disbelief.  I've always been a fan of great musical theatre and these folks should take this show on the road...trust me, buy this movie now and get ready to be shocked and amazed.
0553573403|5.0|Be prepared for over 800 pages of  involved reading and an ending that will leave you hanging big time.  But that's the beauty of this masterpiece...you devote yourself fully to all those pages and you still want more!  I'm heading right to the library tomorrow for book  2 of the series. I can not wait to pick it up and begin reading again. So many storylines are woven together perfectly...I can not say anything superlative about this book that has not been said already.  Personally, I have more unanswered questions and unresolved subplots floating around in my head than I know what to do with.  I have to get the next book ASAP.  Excellent!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The sophomore jinx happens to some artist, and when i first heard some of the songs on the album i thought that happened to alicia but as i got more into the album I found that i enjoyed every song......so was this a sophomore jinx i say hell naw miss keys does it again. She deserves every bit of the five stars I gave her. And she also deserves all five grammy's
B0000C1733|3.0|Of course there is something wrong with this greatest hits cd. Notably, the absense of 'Around the World' 'Aeroplane' and 'Can't Stop'  as well as FIVE songs from Californication.<br />Also, if they're goin to put on 'higher ground' and 'under the bridge' which are also on 'What Hits' then 'Show Me Your Soul' should also be on there
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I'm 16, and hot, without having to look like Britney, I'm a Mexican Britney Spears, and just like Brit, I can't sing either(too bad I don't have a computer that will make my voice sound decent liek Brit).  I liked her last 2 cd's, but this is a little too commercial and kinky!  I'll take Hilary Duff's new cd anyday...
B000001F5A|5.0|My dream is to someday travel to Antartica.  When I do, I will be playing 'Antartica' on a CD with earphones while viewing the magnificent stark beauty of the continent, it's ocean and icebergs.  This album makes me cry every time I play it.  Vangelis was able to depict the 'feel' of this place, even though it is devoid of people and cultures. Actually, there is a 'culture' there; it belongs to the penguins, sea birds, whales - and the beautiful variations in blue.
0812550706|5.0|This was originally written as a short story, which can be found on Orson Scott Card's web site [...]  However, while developing The Speaker for the Dead, he decided that it would best serve as a sequel to Ender's Game, his short story.  So, he turned the short story into a novel which won the Nebula and the Hugo award... the first author to ever win both in the same year.  Then, he wrote the sequel (Speaker) which one both AGAIN!!!<br />This book is a true work of art.  Mr. Card's ability to expand the personality, depth, and life of Ender Wiggin is truly incredible.  The added insite on why Ender was so special in proportion to his siblings makes this story wonderful and did an excellent job of creating plenty of fodder for the sequels.<br />This is a story which takes place in the future.  Earth has been attacked by an alien races (the formics) and by a shred of incredible luck, we beat them with a lucky shot.  But... will we be so lucky the next time the Buggers return?<br />Earth needs a leader.  Someone the likes of George Washington, Alexander the Great, George Patton, etc. etc.  Only he or she needs to be better.  This is where Ender comes in, a young child who has the makings of this great leader.<br />What is the best way to train a child?  Of course, through games.  So Ender is trained for years from very simple games to the unbeatable games (which Ender does end up beating).  But when Ender is better than any game put in front of him, those placed in command to train him must do all they can to improve his sense of command... even if it means cheating and changing the rules to put Ender at a disadvantage.<br />The real game is Ender's life and his sanity as he is pushed to the edge to improve his gaming abilities.  Will the leaders push him too hard or will Ender succeed in becoming the most brilliant commander of all time?  You will find out as you read this brilliant, fun, imaginative, and fantastic page turner.<br />This story is also told from the perspective of Ender's right hand man (child), Bean, in Orson Scott Card's parallel novel Ender's Shadow.  I would highly suggest reading this book first, but you get even more added insite by reading Ender's Shadow.  Both are must reads... especially if you love Ender's Game half as much as I do.<br />A movie is in the works with the screenplay written by Orson Scott Card... I imagine it will probably be as wonderful a movie as this is a wonderful book.<br />If you want to be thrilled, PICK UP THIS BOOK!!!  Also, the sequels are fantastic... not as fantastic as Ender's Game, but a great read in their own right as we follow Ender, his siblings, and Bean into old age... and beyond.  Out of 5 stars, I give it a 10!!!!
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Love the movie, but I'm very disappointed with the DVD.  As you'll read elsewhere, there are the mandatory previews at the beginning (ugh) but my beef is with the one thing I bought the DVD for in the first place.  On my copy, the &quot;Where are they now&quot; section has so many distortions, both audio and video, that it is almost unwatchable.  I am hoping to return it to amazon.ca as a defective product.  Very, very disappointing to see this low quality.  Also, there was NOTHING in the case except the disc itself, not even a printed list of the chapters...special edition indeed!
B00009ATIX|4.0|This movie was not what I had been expecting.  It was not a sappy love story, but instead was more focused on the unexplained events on the space station.  The writers never quite explain exactly what is going on, but they let you make up your own mind.  George Clooney does a great job, as usual, but could not have pulled it off without the rest of his cast.  Give this movie a try, you may be surprised.
B00005JMFI|5.0|Will Ferrell is soo good at accting like a kid, and it is one of my new fave christmas movies.  I will be buying it!
B000002LQR|5.0|this album is one of the best of the 90s.its a classic,a mix of punk,funk,and rock.and anthony kiedisvoice is unique,flea destroys his bass in every song,jonh has a great guitar playing style and chad kicks out the drums.the great thing about this album is the different subjects it talks about,and it has great balads such as i could have lied and under the bridge.but the greatest songs in this album are give it away and suck my kiss.this album is great,you just cant stop listening to it,and when you think you had enough ,you want to listen to it again.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The lingering sting in my ear when i listened to Let it Be origianlly, thinking on how it was not how it was meant to be, made its ranking in my collection of Beatles Compact discs a bit low. But this Let it Be Naked cd made me proud. Especially with The Long and Winding Road, with the overdubbing of an archestra that it had before it almost sounded like the theme song to a television series... but in its more pure form on this new album it rocks me hard. Also Don't Let me Down rings loud and proud in ones ears on this album. It is worth bying, especially with the second disc for your listening pleasures, featuring the Beatles while recording Let it Be. Wonderful, just wonderful.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is a great follow up to the equally great SIAM.  Alicia has mixed a lot of different influences into this album, old skool, hip-hop, classical, blues etc.  Alicia has matured vocally over the past 2 years and musically, well she just gets better and better.  This is definitely a must have album!  The only downside on this album is the track Feeling You Feeling Me..it's a crime that this great piece of music is only a 2 minute interlude..Alicia needs to give music fans the full version.
B00006LIRI|1.0|Pop sucked, there is no other way to describe it.  To secure their legacy, they should have wrapped it up after Rattle and Hum.  They've been Fizzling ever since, and believe me, I was a Bono disciple and U2 as Music Messiah worshipper from the 80s on.<br />Buy all the CDs from Boy to Rattle and Hum (include the movie) and MAYBE the Live in Boston DVD.  The &quot;greatest hits&quot; packages otherwise will indeed leave you still not finding what you were looking for.<br />Donate the money you save from this to Farm Aid and make a difference for good food and jobs for Americans.  Or buy some Beatles CDs and discover who U2 always wanted to be.
B000002OVJ|5.0|OK, let's face it - The Who was not composed of musical geniuses, like Cream on their first live album. And they didn't play as tightly as the Allman Bros, whose \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" is the pinacle of many things. If you are a serious fan of rock, though, these three live albums should be in your collection and you should listen to them often.<br />Why include \\"Live at Leeds\\"? Because this album set the pace for every angry young man who ever picked up a guitar. What are they angry at? Who knows and who cares. But without this shattering performance, I honestly think there would be no Ramones, no Sex Pistols, no Metallica, or power rock of any description. And if you had the chance to see The Who during this period, you know that even the most jaded concert-goer was soon on his feet, yelling along with \\"Young Man Blues\\" or \\"Shaking All Over\\".<br />This is a performance that makes you want to go downtown and throw bricks through windows.
B00005JL78|5.0|Given all the hype around Steven Spielberg's disappointing previous outing, &quot;AI,&quot; (which was perhaps overhyped because of the untimely death of collaborator Stanley Kubrick) I was skeptical about &quot;Minority Report.&quot;  It seemed to be mining the same vein.<br />What a pleasant surprise.  This is a great movie.  It artfully combines intelligence and suspense and paints a compelling view of the future.  I even enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance.  He hasn't been this good since &quot;Jerry Maguire.&quot;<br />I have to say that some of the stuff you see here - like personalized advertising that kicks in when the technology scans your retinas as you walk into a store (as frightening as that sounds) - sounds completely plausible to me.  It's masterfully presented by Spielberg in such a way that its eventual adpotion in 'real life' looks like a done deal.<br />An unexpected delight here:  prolific Swedish character actor Peter Stormare's turn as the creepy, back-alley, eyeball-replacing Dr. Solomon Eddie.  Check out his great 2000 twosome as the loathsome 'Serge' in &quot;Chocolat&quot; and the shy, sweet-hearted 'Jeff,' Bjork's diffident suitor in Lars von Trier's bleak &quot;Dancer in the Dark.&quot;
B00006J9OT|5.0|When I first saw Diana Krall on a PBS TV special, her beauty caught my eye. Then, I listened to her voice and it caught my ear.  Now, after buying &quot;Live in Paris&quot; and several of her other albums, I can honestly say her music has captured my soul. <br />If you were going to own just one Diana Krall album, this one would be it.
020530902X|5.0|5 Stars, of course, so buy it (even if you already have a copy).<br />If you have a copy, give one to somebody. Everybody who has interest in reading or writing should use this book. It's good for academic writing, professional writing, and teaching -- it's just great. It's simple and to the point. It makes you twice the writer or educator after just one short read.<br />What more praise can I give this book? If there were six stars I'd give it six.<br />I wish everybody followed the rules of this book. Our society would function better. Communication is a key to a healthy society and there is so much jargon, rhetoric, and double-talk (even in places where it historically wasn't) that our society is beginning to falter. Now, I am not saying that there is a book that can fix our society, but if there is, don't rush out at buy a bible, get &quot;The Elements of Style.&quot;
B00005JL96|5.0|What's so delightful about this wonderful Disney movie is the transformations that take place with several of the characters.  Lilo starts out a little pouty, a little disobedient, a little timid.  By the end of the movie, we see a different Lilo.<br />Stich, the little devil!, starts out nasty, mean and uncontrollable.  As he learns the value and importance of family, we see a different Stitch.<br />Nani and David also emerge from the initial stages from a pupply love type of romance to a full-blown parental affection for both Lilo and Stitch.<br />I liked the female alien leader, mainly because of her wonderful accent (voiced by the marvelous Zoe Caldwell), and the fact that she reminded me of the mother creature in &quot;Alien.&quot;<br />The bad guys are great, too, and even their transformation is great.  (Except of course for the big evil Captain!).<br />The watercolor art is beautiful and the movie has a wonderful happy feeling.  It's an instant classic!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|WOW!!!!<BR>ALICIA HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS ALBUM SURPASSES SONGS IN A MINOR!<BR>THE LYRICS, VOCALS AND ARRANGEMENTS ON THIS CD ARE SUPERB.<BR>THIS YOUNG LADY HAS MUCH TALENT.<BR>TRACK#6- IF I AIN'T GOT YOU-IS TOTALLY FANTASTIC (my favorite).<BR>THE ENTIRE CD IS ONE YOU COULD PUT ON AND LISTEN TO IT FROM TRACK 1-TRACK 15 AND REPEAT OVER AND OVER.

B00005JM02|5.0|I have a healthy respect for Pixar.  They've done four major films, every one of them was graphically stunning, yes.. but they also realized what makes a great movie isn't just the graphics - but a good STORY.  Finding Nemo is probably my favorite of the four they've done.  Not only is the story heart-warming and touching, but its also funny!<br />The basic plot is that Marlin is an overprotective father who lost his wife and most of his children in a barracuda attack.  His only surviving child is a little clownfish named Nemo, who happens to also have a bad fin.  On the first day of school Nemo's class goes to the dropoff (where the reef stops and the ocean gets deep), where Nemo and his new friends see a boatand  decide to have a competition to see who can swim closer.  Marlin shows up, becomes overprotective and Nemo rebells.  He gets caught by a diver and put in a fishtank.  The remainder of the story is how scaredy cat (er, fish) Marlin goes on a fantastic journey to find his son.<br />I saw some reviewers complaining that the story isn't realistic - but is it supposed to be?  It's supposed to be entertaining and fun, which is it.  The characters are all funny, likeably and interesting.  Dory, who Marlin befriends on his journey, is hilarious throughout the whole movie (&quot;Yes, I'm a natural blue!&quot;).<br />The graphics are amazing as well - Pixar keeps raising the bar with each movie they make.  The bottom line is, this movie is visually stunning, the story is wonderful, the characters are great.. its one of the best movies of the year - no question in my mind!  The DVD is also a great buy - it has tons of features including some behind the scenes stuff that is really interesting.  I especially liked the special which basically went through the entire process of making the movie (albeit condensed - the movie took like 3 years to make!).  Another especially neat feature was how they watched real fish and tried to make all the computerized fish as realistic as possible.<br />It's a great buy - I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed!istic as possible.  <br />It's a great buy - I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed!
B00005JMF6|5.0|Gothika is an awesome Horror Movie about a psychatrist ends up being condemmed into her own ward, and starts to see a dead girl that died 4 years ago and won't leave her alone. I know the plot isn't anything new but it is still a good movie that will keep you at the edge of your seat in suspense. Halle Berry and Robert Downey Jr. are wonderful in the movie and acted very well. It also has a very modern horror movie type style to it.So I think you should go see it first then make a judgment on it. Just give it a fair chance, it is a great movie!!!Keep an open mind!! well g2g PEACE OUT!!!
B00005JKC3|2.0|I actually thought that this movie would be good.  The previews showed that it had great special effects.  Again I was disappointed and realized yet again that special effects do not make a movie.  At one point in the movie the Hulk is fighting a mutant poodle which might I add is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.  The problem I see with this film is the same problem I see with the other Marvel Comics movies being released recently.  The story does not have a steady flow.  The movie stops and goes and by the end I feel like I have movie whiplash.  I don't recommend this film.
B000088E6D|5.0|Buble has arrived! . I first saw and heard him at the World's Children's Day Benefit Concert with Celine Dion about two years ago and have followed his meteoric rise since.<BR>He sang his version of Spiderman at that show and just blew away the audience.(I wish they'd use him for any future Spidy movies!)<br />It is such a pleasure to see the success he's enjoying, both here and abroad -- and no wonder -- he's truly gifted with an incredible voice and stage presence. One of his greatest accomplishments has got to be introducing me and so many others of my generation (I was born in '86) to such good music. Believe me, he's got us turned on to him and this music!!!! <BR>Love you Michael B., just call me  &quot;bigcitygirl&quot;.
B000068VHP|4.0|Even though their 2nd album is usually thought of as their best, this one is actually my favorite. It seems very genuine, innocent, and &quot;Pretty&quot;, much like &quot;The Sundays&quot;. It does include &quot;Linger&quot;, and possibly their most well known song &quot;Dreams&quot;, but I enjoy it for the other tracks even more. I like the moodier songs &quot;Put Me Down&quot;, &quot;Not Sorry&quot;, and &quot;I Will Always&quot; alot more than some of their later pop-rock stuff, though that's good too. The bonus tracks here are all good, but nothing to buy this twice for. More casual fans might just want &quot;Stars: 1992-2002&quot;, but I couldn't do without this one.
B000002LPD|5.0|After two mostly disappinting recods, this second incarnation of Van Halen finally got things going on the right track in 1991 wih For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. For the first time since 1984 Eddie Van Halen goes all-out in his guitar playing, and the results can be stunning(witness the Judgement Day solo to see what I mean). The amount of so-called Hagar Cheese is kept to a minumum here(which isnt saying too much, but compared to the other three albums he made with the band, it's very minimal indeed). Even when they do put on a keyboard-backed balled, it's very tastefully done(Right Now), as opposed to the cheesy, keyboard-heavy '80s singles.<br />Overall, this is a very strong album without any horrible tracks, though a few are rather ordinary. This album is highly recommended for anyone who was a fan to DLR-era Van Halen, but couldnt stand 5150 or OU812.
B00009TB5G|1.0|I purchased this set from amazon and it arrived with multiple disc three's and no disc four.  I returned it to amazon, and to my great misfortune I received multiple disc two's and no disc one.  I have not had any trouble playing the discs but I can't get all four in the same box at the same time! My advise to you is buy this set because the movie is quite good, but purchase it somewhere in person so you can return it faster and easier if/when you get a defective or incomplete set.
B00005JLXE|3.0|This movie was really not all that great.  The way the movie was designed it looked like a second rate independent movie.  I know this was not the case and I think they just could have done a better job.  I had trouble staying focused on this movie as well, it seemed that the movie would stop and go and stop and go.  It never did develop a comfortable flow of the story.  The characters were horribly developed and even Ben Affleck seemed ackward playing the role of Daredevil.  I recommend that if you are in the mood for superheroes buy the old Batman movie.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Was living in Chicago when they filmed this and did a little extra work for em, on the side.
B000002L99|4.0|As far as the &quot;Van Hagar&quot; albums go, this is probably the best one. The following albums are good, but they don't rock front to back like &quot;5150&quot; does. Besides the huge hits &quot;Why Can't This Be Love?&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;, this includes &quot;Love Walks In&quot;, the song &quot;5150&quot;, and the awesome &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot;. Plus possibly my favorite track of all &quot;Summer Nights&quot;. Who can't relate to that one? Of course &quot;Eddie's&quot; guitar is on fire throughout the whole record. I really love the &quot;Dave&quot; years as well, but this one gets played more than the debut in my house. Maybe that's because I have it on cd, cassette, and vinyl.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was completely blown away. I bought all the other cd's of hers, just because they were Britney, and so I bought this one as well. WOW! I love almost every song on the album. Who cares that she talks about sex, she is being a normal 22 year old female. Props to Brit. I really was impressed!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|[...]<br />Now the remaining Beatles have released the \\"Let It Be album\\" said to be closer to the original intent.  The result is less than inspiring.  Gone are the added strings and choirs.  Gone is the \\"wall of sound\\" production.  Gone are the snippets of \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" Added is \\"Don't Let Me Down\\"<br />The result is very odd.  The production may be more \\"raw\\" but it is also somewhat \\"flat\\" and \\"dull\\".  Strangely, the deletion of \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" turns out to be a mistake.  \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" are not r the Beatles at their best but they did inject some much-needed humor into the project.  The \\"naked\\" \\"Long and Winding Road\\" takes some getting used to and is indeed charming; but now the souped up Spector version doesn't seem to be the misstep McCartney has been claiming for all these years.  The stripped down \\"Across The Universe\\" is an improvement.  The rest of the album does not mark much of a difference from the 1970 release.  The version of \\"Get Back\\" used here closely resembles the one used on the original album and not the original single.  And we still do not get the original version of \\"Let It Be\\".  We are spared the atrocity that was put on the 1970 album; but the version we get here is still inferior and graceless.<br />The sequencing of the songs is interesting but it seems there should have been more.  The second disc labeled \\"Fly On The Wall\\" is a twenty minute plus audio experience that gives one some idea of what the movie Let It Be was like.  Good for one fun spin-nothing more.<br />To the millions of Beatles fanatics world over, this album is a nice addition we can file under \\"what could have been\\".  Yet one can only conclude that the project as the Beatles had conceived it during 1968-69 was misgiven.  The relationships among the \\"boys\\" were strained and the music suffered because of it.  The Beatles should either have shelved the project permanently except for a couple of singles or released it as it was in the Summer of 1969 and let Abbey Road remain as their last statement that Fall.<br />To those wondering what the Beatles were all about, this album won't help you understand.  It certainly won't help you see why they were so great.Abbey Road remain as their last statement that Fall.  To those wondering what the Beatles were all about, this album won't help you understand.  It certainly won't help you see why they were so great.
B0000B3B95|1.0|This is the worst movie i've ever seen, I expected so much, something like Spider-man, which was a good movie, or something somewhat better, but the quality, the movie itself sucks tremendously, I mean it is so stupid and boring and SLOW, Hulk appears late and then theres these momentes where everything is dull, I regreted paying for that movie, it was a evry very bad movie. Esta pelicula esta hasta el culo, nunca he visto una peliucula tan fea. Je' n'aime pas le Hulk, et horrible, mais ce nul. Je deteste le movie.
B00004UEN8|5.0|Here it is from the Bosa Nova King.  Put this one and fill the tiki glasses!  An instant party, but you have to like Jazz, not pop.  Also I recommend Billy Holiday!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If this were a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; or &quot;Best Of&quot; collection, we could argue forever about what's here and what's missing. But it's 27 #1 hits, so there goes any arguements. Besides, how can we complain about 27 #1 hits on one cd from the best band in history anyway? This collection is precisely what it's supposed to be, an introduction to new fans, and one stop shopping for all the casual ones. Beatlemaniacs should already have all the essential albums. The only real bummer here, is nothing from &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, recently voted the best album ever by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and nothing from &quot;The Beatles (white album)&quot;. Otherwise it's an amazing and lengthy collection. Only one other cd offers so much musical history all in one place: &quot;ELV1S 30 #1 Hits&quot;.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This movie was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen!!! The whole movie is just clips of fight seens that drag on forever and the main characters having lots of sappy romance seens! In one of the last sceens the main character is told to choose beetween two doors: the first is to save the city, which would other wise be wiped out, killing EVERYONE, and the second save Trinity(I never found out if she was his wife or girlfriend). Which does he choose? He chooses Trinity, who, obvesly, is included in the EVERYONE, and  so she will obvesly die to!!! Very smart!!! This is a waist of time!
B0000AQVCL|2.0|Are these guys a cover band???  I like this brand of music, but come on, this is practically ripped off from everybody else you've enjoyed in this genre.<BR>If you really want to save money, avoid this album and download some music from AC/DC, Aerosmith or even Ratt.<BR>Don't get me wrong here people, the music isn't bad, it's just stuff you've heard about 10,000 times.
B00003CXB4|3.0|Am I the only parent who's troubled by how incredibly violent this movie is? The majority of the scenes were fights and struggles, or fear-creating. Obviously it's a good vs. evil movie, but rating it G when there's so much violence (Scar hitting Simba's mother and knocking her out, constant violent fights between lions and hyaenas, etc.) seems ridiculous to me. I had never seen it until I just rented it for my 3-year old daughter, and I'm horrified that it's rated G. It should be PG--the subject matter is too old for a G audience. I can only imagine how many times the word &quot;kill&quot; was uttered in this movie. G should mean that any kid who is mature enough to sit through a movie should be able to watch it, but obviously that's not the case--it's G simply because it's animated? Ridiculous.<br />And what, tell me, is Disney's fascination with killing off parents before their time?
B000009ED0|5.0|I'm a fan from waaay back in the day.  You all dont even have Kid's &quot;Grits and Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; do ya?<br />Nah, yr not his true fans.  but thats ok....
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania shines in this concert. Her voice is very unique, and she blends genres better than any one else in the business. Brilliant performance!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I always loved the original album.  Great songs. I never understood why people called it a bad album.  Paul's Let it Be, Get Back and Long & Winding Road were all #1 singles and all were better than any of his songs on Sgt. Pepper, for example.  And the harder songs on LIB really cook. (Lennon screaming \\"I told you so\\" on Dig a Pony is fabulous.)  The original LIB gets 5 stars in my books.  I'm not saying it's the best album ever but I'd put it up against any album by anybody.  Let's just say a less than perfect Beatles album beats the best album of most performers. LIBN, however, cannot be rated based solely on the songs because its not giving us new songs.  We know them already.  <br />Paul's been a bit uptight for the past 33 years over an album called Let it Be. Anyone else see find that as hysterically ironic as I do? John must be laughing somewhere. It's \\"new\\" Beatles stuff - so - hey, I bought it. I'm an addict. But really, it's nothing we haven't heard before. And it's still not really the definitive version of Let it Be. Aside from the fact two members of the band did not and could not have participated in track selections, ordering, edits and remixes, the alternate versions of some songs (Don't Let Me Down, in particular) chosen for this release - while interesting - clearly aren't even the best takes. (The single of DLMD is far superior). I mean - if this was supposed to be the album the way it was supposed to be, wouldn't they have used the best takes?  It seesm to me different versions were put on here for the sake of being different.<br />And with the CD format, they should have put more jamming and rehearsals from the LIB sessions, like Maggie May and Dig It, instaed of removing them. Everyone knows there's a ton of that out there.  Two stars due to the lousy title and cover art, less than honest marketing and not giving us anything really new.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I must say that I like the ROTK soundtrack the best of all three soundtracks. It's definately not because the soundtracks of the other two movies are any lesser than this soundtrack, but because of the emotional weight the concluding movie of the trilogy carries. If you'd been as expectant of the triloggy as I was, then I think you'd share this feeling of emotional weight. The FOTR soundtrack was light and cheery, especially towards the beinning, leaving one with an expectant feeling in Enya's May It Be. The TTT soundtrack was grand and epic, with a feeling of wild untamed lands as echoed in the Rohan theme. It ends with a spine tingling performance by Emiliana Torrini in Gollum's Song, that leaves one with a feelling of sympathy for the poor creature. The ROTK soundtrack reprises a lot of the earlier motifs and adds the glorious Gondorian theme that we heard traces of in the earlier movies. Annie Lennox's Into the West is by far the best piece on the disc, though Minas Tirith comes close. The fat that this is the last that we shall hear of the trilogy leaves one with a feeling of sadness just like at the end of the book itself. A terrific buy!
B00005U11Z|1.0|Steve Perry is Journey and Journey is Steve Perry. Anyway you look at it things have not been the same since he left the band.  It's easy to get a sound-a-like to take over the lead vocals, it's not easy to have a hit record, or in this case a hit DVD.  This DVD is one of the worst that I have ever seen, call me a die hard Steve Perry fan at heart. I look foward to the Journey DVD with Steve Perry.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I have Songs in A Minor and this album is better, there is more diversity and her voice is stronger.  It does have a more old school sound to it, but the sound is crafted so well that does not matter.  Overall the album flows very well and there is upbeat, ballads and everything in between.  One of the best to come out this year, no doubt about it.  She tries some different things here, but pulls it off wonderfully.  Here is some advice:  Do not compare the 2 albums, just listen to this one with an open mind.  They are both excellent pieces of work that are well worth your time.  This albumn has a different feel to it, but still retains the ballads she has become known for.  Excellent work here.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  I hadn't planned on watching it, but my sister gave such a glowing review that I gave in and watched it.  I LOVED IT!!!!
B00007FOMP|1.0|I have had this album for over 10 years now and I am still trying to work out what the fuss is about. I adore Marvin Gaye and his work, but this album leaves me cold. It is a hotch-potch LP of classical and jazz. I go along with Motown who didn't want to release it at the time. If I was to direct somebody who has never heard much of Marvin, this is not the album I would direct them to. It is a very depressing album, however it gets one star because it is produced well. Other than that....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best DVD release of the season. I cannot stress enough how great this show is. I am looking forward to its arrival in the mail in a couple of weeks.
B000002JS0|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums AC/DC made. Its one of their first, but outstanding. Bon's voice is great (as always) and the tracks really rock. Bon plays his bag pipes while Angus rocks on his Gibson on &quot;Its A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock And Roll) and it sounds great. This album in my opinion the best next to &quot;Highway To Hell&quot; and &quot;Live 2 CD Collectors Addition&quot;. This is a must buy for everyone. Trust me. You will listen to it apon hours.
B000002UQJ|4.0|In the Casette I Have of This album There are 10 Minutes empty in Side B(Side of Cam'on People).10 Minutes unprovected That could put in There one or Two Songs More or Change one or two Song from SIDE A To Side B.The CD I Think only There are The songs but not that Empty Space.
B0000C1733|5.0|Come on people just because about 5 or 6 of the songs are on there last greatest hit cd does not menan this sucks. I think this cd is cool and fun to listen to. There is nothing wrong with this cd!!!
B000003N89|5.0|This is my favorite Krall CD as she swings much more on this Nat King Cole Trio tribute (not just sultry singing like her newer Cds) . Also she plays the piano more. I would buy her CDs just to listen to here play the piano as she is one the best jazz pianist on the scene today. I like her song selection which includes Hit that Jive Jack, Frim Fram Sauce, Deed I Do. Baby baby all the time, Gee Baby ain't I good to you . Her trio (like the Nat King Cole Trio)with no drums - Russel Malone on guitar and Paul Keller on bass really sound good together.
0553582445|5.0|Ah, the familiar characters, the interesting plot twists, and the enchanting way Hobb has of telling her story. I could not put it down, and I don't regret it.  This was definitely a book to savor and when I was done... I can't wait to get the 2nd book in this series. My bf and I are eagerly waiting for Dec. 2nd, when Golden Fool will come out in paperback.

B00008IXAR|4.0|Simply Red's performing style evokes a nostalgic feeling and is instantly pleasurable listening...but several tracks on this CD are fresh enough for new listeners unfamiliar with their warm and winning style.
B00006IU73|5.0|This band is very difficult to throw in a certain genre.  Actually it is quite impossible.  They can throw a little hard rock at you one minute and then turn around and have a nice balad featuring a banjo and then rock your socks off with some metal.<br />The album starts off with the dreamy yet heavy &quot;Blackest Eyes.&quot;  This would clearly be a single and *should* be played on the radio.  But we all know that good music is no longer played on the radio.  Then we move into a softer &quot;Trains&quot; It gets a little heavier in the choruses but remains lighter and emotional.  And we're treated with a rocking banjo solo in the middle.  The Sound Of Muzak totally disses the state of music saying: &quot;One of the wonders of the world is going down.  One of the blunders of the world is that no one cares.  No one cares at all.&quot;  Very chilling.<br />Heartattack in a Layby is a very emotional piece.  The desperation of lonliness is just oozing off of this atmospheric piece.  There is an anti-war almost instrumental: .3  Very well done.  If your looking for something really heavy: &quot;The Creator had a Mastertape&quot; is where you'll find it.  And then you can cool off with the piano and strings ballad: &quot;Collapse the Light into Earth.&quot;<br />All in all one of the best albums ever to be made.  Enjoy!
B00005JM02|5.0|I bought this at target for a low price and I have been enjoying it still.
B0000021RD|4.0|Like a lot of these guys writing here (girls never cared much for Chicago in the early 70's), I've been rediscovering some classic rock, and Chicago more than most of these bands NEEDS rediscovering, since they got misplaced somewhere in the 80's.  Along the way they turned into a soft-rock band and lost their roots, but most of us remember them as real musical path-setters.  It's almost hard to remember how dominant they were, one of the top bands for at least five years.<br />Many of us played in high school bands and knew something about music.  I often compare them to Blood Sweat and Tears, who were the first rock band to feature horns.  BS&amp;T had better soloists and covered some great arrangements, they were slicker and more polished than Chicago, more New York, if you will.  BS&amp;T brought rock to the music of Broadway and Frank Sinatra, but then along came Chicago, who did their own thing.  Here was real rock with brass and saxes to develop the music, adding extra colors and flavors that were often missing (and still are).  And many people were VERY grateful.  On top of this they had a top-notch drummer in Danny Seraphin, who more than any member helped bring the music to life, and Terry Kath, an exciting guitarist who knew the rock vocabulary and could absolutely burn.<br />Chicago II was definitely their BEST album.  The first one, Chicago Transit Authority, had some good songs and jams.  But Chicago II is where the band showed its real promise.  They relied less on heavy jams and more on varied tempos and textures. Songs like Movin In, In The Country and the great suite on side 2 showed some arranging genius that tickled and kept you off balance.  The biggest hit, 25 of 6 to 4 (has anyone ever learned where the title came from?) featured a tremendous guitar solo combining jazzy improvisation with psychedelic wah-wah.<br />On the down side, Chicago was very weak in the lyrics department - in fact this was their ultimate downfall as a band, which kept them out of the top tier of Beatles-Stones-Springsteen-Eagles.  They also lacked great singing - sometimes youre not sure WHAT the words are.  Too often the songs included pseudo-revolutionary lyrics in anti-war songs that now sound like the ranting of a spoiled teenager.  You suspect, listening to them now, that their producer told them this stuff would sell the music, and since the band only had a couple good love songs in them, the political pose was their next resort.  The &quot;Better End Soon&quot; suite at the end is pretty disposable in this regard.  At least they didn't glorify drugs, and once the Vietnam war was over, pop culture was ready to forgive them and let them transform into the mellow sound they adopted later on.<br />Yet you don't listen to Chicago II for the words.  We didn't car much about all that stuff, we really wanted the rush of a band that could rock with powerful sounds, hinting of the jazz-rock fusion we would later come to love, but still mix it up with delicate and complex arrangements.  So buy Chicago II not just to hear some musical history but to hear some good music that should NOT be forgotten.
0316666343|1.0|This is the most unsatisfying book I've read in years.  The only reason I bothered to finish was because it was the most recent choice of my book club.  I kept waiting for something redeeming to occur, which didn't happen until I slammed it shut for the final time. <br />The story is pedestrian and the writing banal.  There isn't anything original about this novel, and many of the characters (i.e., the grandmother) though meant to be quirky and eccentric, are simply cliche and annoying. This book is best reserved for adolescents, but only if the goal is to inhibit their imaginations.<br />If you feel compelled to read something unsophisticated, this is your book. But do yourself a favor ... buy a used paperback edition.
0399226907|5.0|Such a fun and somewhat interactive (counting) book for little ones.  My son loved this book from before he could read until well after he'd learned to read.  Now, at age 13, he still enjoys reading this to his 4 year old sister.  And ANY book by Eric Carle is worth buying!!  His illustrations are extraordinary!
0140182829|5.0|This little novel is the kind of literature that has everything to be appealing and unforgettable. It is set in one of the most beautiful parts of France, a distant, remote land of forests, lagoons and castles. It recounts a tale of childhood and adolescence, a time of innocence long lost and of hazy adventures in the long evenings and vacations of school times. It involves a glimpse of total bliss and the dream of permanent and absolute happiness. It verges on the border between reality and fantasy.<br />The story is told by Francois Seurel, the son of the schoolmaster in a small, secluded town in la Sologne (Central France). One day a new kid comes to study and live with Francois's family. He is called Le Grand (the great) Meaulnes. He's a natural leader and an independent kid who one day steals a carriage in order to go pick up Francois's great parents. He gets lost in the woods and loses the carriage, which forces him to wander around the countryside where, after some time, he comes to an ancient domain, a big, decaying house where a huge party is about to begin. He notices everybody seems to be welcome and after a nap in a bedroom he finds old-style clothes seeminlgy ready for him to wear. So he does and he goes to the party. At some point he meets &quot;the&quot; girl, the most beautiful living being he's ever seen, and of course he falls madly in love with her. But she's mysterious and they will only have chance to exchange names. The day after, the party ends on enigmatic circumstances and Meaulnes gets a ride home at night, and so he is unable to figure out the way back to the house. The rest of his life will be one long and tragic search for the place and the girl of his dreams, and to reveal more would be unkind to potential readers.<br />As with basically all other books that can aspire to immortality, this one can be read in many levels. You can simply take the story at face value and appreciate it as a great tale, but for me it was impossible not to glimpse some kind of deep symbolism in it, something about the nostalgia for innocence lost, for the irretrievable days of our youth, for the kind of love that is hard to feel later on in life (for good and bad). There is also something about that old notion of being careful with what you wish for, lest you achieve it. The book borders around the realistic, the romantic and the gothic, and it has its touches of magic which are highlighted by the incredible scenery in which the story takes place. It is probably one of the greatest tales ever told and it sure will agitate in the reader their own memories of countryside vacations and that little girl one once saw, fell in love wiht, but was unable to see again (or maybe yes, but in less romantic circumstances). It achieves what great literature does: sparkling something valuable, in this case totally bittersweet, inside the reader's brain, and it is only possible to regret Fournier's early death in that stupidest of massacres, WWI.

B00003CXRM|3.0|I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (&quot;Fargo&quot;), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.<br />&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is a retelling of Homer's &quot;Odyssey,&quot; or &quot;Homer's Odyssey,&quot; since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing? <br />It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. &quot;I'm a Dapper Dan Man!&quot; he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.<br />The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.<br />Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.<br />The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.<br />I've read &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least \\"The Odyssey\\" was weird for a reason - \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" could certainly do without the strangeness.<br />Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.<br />The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in &quot;Fargo,&quot; the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.<br />The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to &quot;Fargo.&quot; Maybe I just wanted something better. So withlast night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.<br />&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than &quot;Fargo,&quot; which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;Signs&quot; was different than &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; in a delightfully splendid way, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better.
