B00AA9DDSC|5|I luv this mascara .. It's was shipped to me very quickly .. Lancôme mascara is my favorite and one of the best.
B00CBZ8NT2|5|Exactly as promised.
B009CXYVBA|2|I don't understand what this is suppose to do.  Nothing happen at all.  The mask was very moist though.  Moisturized my face, although that wasn't why I bought this one.
B00OP226T2|2|It didn't brighten my hair like the box described. I need to lights it three more times before I get this color.
B0092MCO88|5|My Wife Loves This
B008JSJ9HU|5|Satisfied
B001IM5VT4|4|Great product that compares to oil of Olay but smaller price tag. Used to purchase only oil of Olay now only purchase this one.
B00028PJD8|4|Fabulous natural alternative.  Be careful,  it will leave a yellow stain on anything that is white.
B000ISD4QG|5|This works brilliantly as an antiperspirant, and I love the scent. It's just a light, sweet floral smell. I personally detest the &#34;shower fresh&#34; style scents, but I'm also not fond of really heavy sweet perfumes in deodorants. This is a nice medium - sweet, but not heavy or over-powering.
B000UQDN76|1|Don't waste your time with this product. It's something you would find in a dollar store but 5 times more expensive. It's not worth the strip of tape and ink I used to return it which was immediately.
B000H723LU|2|As a little background:  I'm a middle-aged woman with sensitive skin.  I use Cetaphil facial cleanser and Cerave cream on my face.  Reading the ingredient list:  : Saccharomycopsis Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aqua (Water/ Eau), Sodium Benzoate, Methylparaben, Sorbic Acid. Free of Sulfates, synthetic fragrances, and GMO. was very concerning for me, particularly because SKII advertises as a &#34;natural&#34; cosmetic line.  It looks like a list of preservatives, with the first ingredient being yeast.  I tried it for a few days; it had no effect on my skin and I will not continue using it.
B00385WMK0|5|Work great for my wife using curlers and hot iron. Excellent heat resistant surface.
B000FS05VG|2|I've had this dryer for about a year. I usually use the high speed but now in the middle of drying a section of hair, it's started reverting to the low setting for a few seconds, then goes back to high. This didn't start until just recently so I'm figuring it's about to die out on me. When the speeds change, the lights in my house start flickering. I'm just wondering it anyone else had this problem? I need to find a 3 speed AND 3 heat setting drier since the high setting on this dryer is extremely hot, burning my scalp but low setting is way too low. HELP!
B00GW1HKHW|4|i bought this a while back, never really got around to using it. I have scars left over from my acne, which im always trying to cover up. anyways, i started using the derma roller, on my first go i found it to be abit painful, but nothing that you cant endure, it got easier as i used it more and more and four weeks later im already starting to see the results, small acne scars are already fading and the needles dont bother me anymore.<br />if theres anyone trying to make their mind up, id say go for it ! you've got nothing to loose !
B00778LTDU|5|I got this because of the reviews on here.  I honestly didn't expect much because I've been using Tigi Bed Head products and thought they were the best.  Not when it comes to mousse though.  I have fine,long hair, all one length.  I thought for the price of the Garnier XXL Body mousse I had nothing to lose to give it a try.  I let my hair towel dry itself (left it wrapped up until most moisture was wicked away by the towel).  Then I flipped all my hair forward and down.  I applied 2 \\"blobs\\" of the mousse, making sure to get the roots pretty well.  I blow dried my hair upside down on med heat, then finished it off with the cold shot for a couple of minutes to help it set.  I flipped my hair back and wow.  It wasn't super big volume, but even fine hair is going to weigh itself down at the roots.. But my hair look incredible, and I'm my own worst critic when it comes to my hair.  It had enough volume that I was able to use my flat iron on it (but not the roots!) and I still had volume, and even a bit of a healthier sheen to my hair.  I've read other reviews and have to say, if this product isn't working for you or is making your hair look oily or brittle, you're probably using too much, which is easy to do.  We tend to think more is better, but that's not always the case.  I'm happy to say goodbye to overpriced over hyped mousse.  This is now a permanent part of my 'hair fixin' routine.
B00A2XQWIY|4|Very nice large gold clutch.
B00B0G0FOO|5|Works great!  Honestly, can see a difference with first application!?
B0006PS3KI|4|Worked well. You can get this stuff cheaper at your local hardware store more then likely.
B005F6O2DU|5|I love this wig!  I got it in the 8462 tri color blonde and it's beautiful.  It is almost identical to my natural haircolor and so no one knows I'm wearing a wig.  I got it to wear because I've been losing some hair on the top due to a medical condition and this looks great.  It is not too shiny like most blonde wigs and is very natural looking.  I did trim the front sides to a graduated look to make it look even more natural and I love it.  I highly recommend this wig.
B00IH11RGA|5|Awesome colonge.!
B00GHISXXK|5|Really Beautiful and cheap
B000142KZ8|5|I love it
B00NSCB8MQ|5|perfect for my pimples and works great
B003DKAGJ4|5|Only hair moisturizer that works for my 4c permed hair
B004WDV2XA|2|this product was okay, but it didn't really work in my hair, and the quality was poor because it broke after like 5 minutes &#62;.&#60;
B00AGEWPQ2|5|Bump defense is a great product, it got rid of my ingrown hairs on my face
B00U7YZM3Y|4|Love the colors! You get a wide variety. The lipsticks themselves are so small, so it's not a lot of product. Great for any Haunted Mansion  or lipstick enthusiast. Just be prepared that &#34;mini&#34; really means mini in this product.
B00L49GVHM|5|I ordered these because I use them and they do an excellent job.  My hair is mingled grey.  These products make my grey hair POP with silver shine and I get lots of compliments.  I do cheat and leave it in my hair a bit longer.  A lady with no grey hair said &#34;I want that.  How do I get THAT color?&#34;
B006Z77J6A|5|Fabulous color blush. Product is as promised. Great transaction. Thank you!
B00QJDXBSU|5|This product is wonderful. I used the vinegar with it and my face felt so nice afterwards. I was so excited to get to review this product and now I am even more excited to get to use it all of the time! If you struggle with acne this is a great product!
B0086DORHK|5|I love my Mac Pro pallete! It was a little bit smaller than what I was expecting but it's perfect! I love it and it makes my job as a makeup artist so much easier!
B000W3RJEA|5|I have been using this stuff since high school (a long time ago) and I still find this is the best foundation out there! I have tried them all and nothing compares. I was freaking out when they stopped selling it in American stores, so I was relieved to find I can buy it online...although I can't find the exact color I used to buy, I think they discontinued it, but this one comes close enough. I love that even if you buy a slight shade off, it sort of just blends into your skin within a few hours and looks totally natural, I always get compliments on my skin when wearing this, it makes you look flawless! I hope they never stop making this stuff!!
B0073RQMXC|5|These blades will last a long time and with eight in a pack you are getting a really good value!  I love these blades and the shaver is the best that I have used.  Gets you really smooth, and the hydrating gel definitely helps to moisturize!
B00326GR9W|4|These things work pretty good....IF....you remember to re-fill them.  They dont last forever so you have to keep an eye on them if your don't want to dry out your stash.
B006UET92K|1|It does not twist up and its very waxy.  So seriously thats it. Once that little bit is used up, its done! What a rip off!! Do not. Waste. Your. Money.
B00GTACVU2|5|I've used a lot of clear polish and I like this the best.  It's stronger<br />than any other and my nails have a chance to grow out.
B0014LZIWY|5|best sunscreen ever, mad that I have to order it on line now.
B007ZDZZ14|5|If you are new to the idea of sugar waxing, this is definitely the one to try.  You will never want to go back to regular waxing.  All natural ingredients and better for your skin, this stuff is great.  It is long lasting and even has a pleasant smell.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try sugaring!  Awesome quality product that knocks all others out of the water!
B002JNV8JI|4|Luv this product! My boyfriend couldn't keep his nose out of my hair. A Lil pricey tho. I may have to  shop around for better pricing smd cheaper,shipping.
B000BH5IN6|2|this item was listed as a newer better version of an older razor but it does not even compare. it does not cut any where near as efficient as the older model and takes twice as long.
B000K9CEGO|5|The oil smells very nice - like roses as you would expect from rose oil, but it does fade rather quickly.  While the fragrance fades with time, the moisturizing qualities of the oil seem to last throughout the day.  I use it as a special treat to make it last a bit longer.  I imagine that if I were to use it daily after every shower/bath, the bottle would only last a couple of weeks at most.
B0054Y1YBQ|5|Got it in a timely fashion.
B006K9OQSC|4|It comes with 2 large and 2 small, use the larger one for longer hair.  It is great for really long hair and awesome for a ballerina.
B006S4PHTQ|4|Though the bottle is tiny, the delicious scents that come from it made my wife quite the happy little minx. Personally, I enjoyed the cute packaging that it came in that let me hang it on the Christmas Tree. Oh, Victoria's Secret - you clever little devil.
B00N79XHME|4|I got this product to use for Halloween as part of my Cleopatra costume since I don't have my own bangs. For Halloween, this is definitely a great purchase versus buying a cheap wig. The only downside is, the bangs were too long. Without trimming them, in order for the bangs to fall at the right length above my eyes, the clip would go too far back on my head making it look unnatural.
B0000YUXI0|5|This stuff worked.  Broke my three year old over night from finger sucking.
B005CHEH5K|5|Works good and looks nice for days. I like soft colors. Also Sally Hansen is a product you can depend on.
B009E0RO92|5|great.... It holds lots of things..price is great also..plan to order more
B00720ITUE|5|Use this while I steam my face and follow up by IQ Natural Squalane. My skin feels softer than the south end of a north bound baby!
B00G4SDPHC|5|My skin feels and looks so much better! I've been using this day and night for a week. I'm so relieved my skin is glowing!😘😘😘
B0046VJTX8|4|This concealer has great coverage without looking cakey. This is definitely one of the best drug store beauty face products I've used. I've been using it for 3 years now, and it hasn't failed me yet.
B001FWXIW4|5|I bought this for My wife on our anniversary and she loved it!!!!<br /><br />That's what makes it 5 stars<br /><br />I will be buying her more.
B00IJT0U3G|1|Poor quality, wish I would have returned it.
B00HVNYIFW|4|I love the smell of roses.... and the scent of this soap did not disappoint.  I also love soap that lathers, and this one does very well.  My only critique is that the scent doesn't last terribly long on my actual body.... and the bar itself is rather small.... but other than that, it's great!!!  :)
B0095IMNI0|5|Love the double Pik.  I thought it was discontinued, or maybe it was and came back.  In any case, it is great.
B00GYF65TK|5|Very very pleased with this product.  I never write reviews on Amazon (although I get Amazon pkgs at least once a week!) but I wanted to show my support for this product.  It has a visible effect on the eye area within a few minutes of applying.  My eyes were blood shot, puffy and awful this morning after a night of drinking, heavy makeup and then so much makeup remover and elbow grease to get it off.  I also have had basically no sleep this week and a cold.  Put this stuff on and I all the redness, swelling, puffy, dryness was gone within 5-7 minutes.  Buy this!
B000J2A8BK|5|After the first day of  spring sunshine, my eyebrows fade to a pale yellowish white and stay that way til about Thanksgiving.  Eventually I get a bit of a tan and you can see the white eyebrows but most of the year they just seem invisible.  As I get older, they are also getting a lot sparser. Seems like i used to have bushier eyebrows.....hmmm.  I want a product that will add some color and a bit of volume to my brows.  I'm not a big wearer of makeup so a heavily penciled or powdered brow looks odd to me and the colors are all too dark.  Plus the color seems to wear off quickly or, worse  run in the rain.  NO such problems with Mommy Brow Tint.  its a gel like product that  goes on like mascara , dries quickly and stays on most of the day,  than washes off easily.  The color is VERY SUBTLE though.  it takes a few sweeps for my eyebrows to get coverage but I think that is do to to few eyebrow hairs not the product itself..  I can use the tip to pencil in a few faux hairs if needed. (OK that sounds freakish but for those with thin sparse eyebrows, you know what i mean.  ) Even if I don't wash it off, it doesn't smear off at night it just seems to fade away somehow.  I  I chose the blonde since going from nearly  invisible, pale  eyebrows to something matching my auburn hair seemed too much of a change.  But I might try the auburn  color soon.  Blonde is a bit to taupe for my auburn hair and my slightly ruddy skin color.  I like this product but I a minimalist when it comes to makeup.  I usually wear none at all.  if you want t dramatic dark brow , this is certainly not the product for you.  If you have really short eye brow hairs, this might not be right for you either. It would be hard to apply it.  But works for me and I am psyched to try the auburn color next for a better match to my hair and skin.
B008DWSJ1O|5|excellent service and responsive . great products
B0028Q01Q2|5|I really like this product quite a bit.  Being older, my hair is thinning a little and this product gives it volume and the height that I really like.  I use it on my wet hair and perk it up during the week on dry hair.  Great product.
B003IYRJMW|5|To expensive to continue use. There are other products with growth factors now.
B001FOFI0W|5|LOOOOOVVVVVE this product.
B004CNMI3S|4|So far so good!  With the base coat and the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat my nails stay nice for almost 2 weeks!
B00H8S02Z0|1|Broke after 3 uses. The pin came undone. Also, the clip that I was sent looked significantly different than the picture.
B0002M5JO8|5|So happy to find these brushes that fit my oral b vitality. Was able to buy at wal-mart but thy discontinued them and I have been using my last brush head way past its life expectancy. Love this toothbrush, have had it over tens years and just keeeps going so glad tofind these on amazon
B00CD1QU80|5|This Electric Razor was such a great deal for the price! At first I was Skeptical because I've been a razor man, but I wont be needing those anymore with this!
B00KRINCR8|3|Fairly good conditioner but no colonia scent experience after the rinse out. Much better conditioners for the price.
B00FKHBCX2|2|So far no visible changes, it has been 24 days. I feel that my face is moisturize. I was hoping to see a big difference, but nothing..
B00016XJ4M|5|Great scent and fresh!
B00BK9ZMVM|5|Excellent service. Would buy again.
B00HMEBRKO|4|Only used once but seems to be a great razor. On two nicks! Appears to be good quality and blades are sharp!
B00261JIQ8|4|It does what I need it to do. What people don't understand is that these are not magnetic. I know it says that, but I believe that is just what they're called. They're NOT magnetic. I did not buy them thinking that they were so.. If that's what you want, you wont be happy with these rollers. The only thing that I realized after buying this pack, is that I spent way more money than I had to. Just go to a beauty supply store. They sell the same thing for a cheaper price. I'm happy with this product though.
B000WA6NOU|5|The quality was excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase here again.
B00AHAWWO0|3|I'm torn because they work well but leave my mouth in so much pain
B00M0F8J10|5|Exactly as ordered. They look awesome!
B005UKRRKG|3|The shadows have a lot of fall out. I wish they had more matte shades. It was packaged really safely..no broken shadows
B00MTZUPWW|4|Good product exactly as expected, but took off one star because the hair ties smell really bad like mothballs. Washed them twice, soaked in vinegar, aired out for over a week, put them in the sunlight and they still smelled. Finally I sprays with febreeze and the smell is finally gone!
B0016LY5JE|5|if  you haven't tried this body wash, you are really missing something!  It is absolutely wonderful, I meant to give it as a gift, but just couldn't part with it!
B00819JRNS|5|Out of numerous eyebrow pencils I have tried I find this looks the most natural and is very easy to use. It darkens some of my eyebrows that are lightening with age and makes my eyebrows look thicker. I already bought a second one.
B000QS6W0I|3|I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw there were no &#34;used&#34; ones for sale.<br /><br />&#34;
B00KFQ0GDU|5|Great set.. Must buy! Authentic!
B00I2U96XC|5|I get so many compliments with this half wig. Some thought it was my hair. Great Price too!
B00DWHX6TU|5|Thank you. Was in perfect confition
B000AB3NWQ|5|I am sorry to hear that the other reviewer didn't like this.  This came in my first order of Belle Lucce products and I love it!  It wasn't too harsh, smelled just like coffee and left me feeling soft. It does leave coffee grinds in the tub but every coffee scrub I have ever tried does it too. Just rinse it out and it's no big deal at all. The smell and feeling are definitely worth the effort!
B001PLH58I|5|This stuff smells soooo good. It came in a huge bottle and at such a great price. Once i get low I will definitely order more.<br /><br />Very relaxing, and made my skin feel so soft :)
B0000A1WGK|5|I have bought many straighteners before. I have thick hair and I always straighten my hair at night then again in the morning and still through out the say, my hair begins to kink. But I got this flat iron for my birthday and I love it. I was skeptical at first because it felt cheep, light and that it would suck. I LOVE IT! My hair not only straightened in HALF the time, but it STAYED straight ALL night. All I had to do was touche it up. My hair stayed straight all day. This is well worth 26 dollars. Why pay 100's of dollars for something that will give the same results?    5 Stars!
B00AACBZMU|5|I have sensitive skin, but these agree with me!! I love how fresh and clean my face feels after using them. So convenient and the best price out there!
B002ASTV2I|5|I did know the product before ordering it and like it very much. For me it is a good alternative to mousses or gels and a natural product in addition. Save your Skin Is great, too
B004AM2Q38|5|Best wax I ever used.
B00HBP0PIY|3|Not for everyday use. It she'd of course. You can put heat to it. It tangles very easily. It looks good if braided but not just wearing it down.
B00EOXX5YM|1|I used it once. Just on my lower legs to try it out. Immediately washed my hands thoroughly with soap.  The tanning smell is still on my hands a day later. Very strong smell. The only reason I tried this product was because of users saying no smell at all. And, there is no return label or instructions. Red flag!!
B00JLPM8AK|5|Combine with a Vita 'C' serum for outstanding results
B00JLPM8AK|1|Dissatisfied with this product! No noticeable change.
B005IF6KHE|3|i dont like the fact that they take so long to arrive waiting for them is just anticipating. i hope they are worth the wait when they arrive :D
B00DQ5NFO4|5|This was larger than I had expected, but it works great!  It's easier to mix cosmetic products with this than in the palm of your hand.  Yay, no more yellowing of the nail and skin from mixing vitamin C powder.
B00OI4ANG0|1|It doesn't work at all. Fake advertising and taking more money
B001KYTXQ2|5|Great makeup, would buy this again
B00C3IG8AS|1|I read a lot of reviews saying that the product was great and even lifted black hair! I had very light brown, almost dirty blonde hair that I wanted to lift to a pale blonde, so i thought that this would work for me. Well, I guess I was wrong. I left it on for 50 minutes and followed the directions perfectly. It barely lifted the brown in my hair, and it was very uneven. Some of my hair was a yellow, brassy color while brown streaks went through it. That could very possibly be my fault in not applying the product evenly enough, but this is what gets me,<br /><br />On some parts of my ends, not all, it completely fried my hair. Those areas look white, and refused to take any dye I put on them, even though the dye was darker. I slept in a deep conditioner that's supposed to help repair hair, and the next day after rinsing it out, I brushed through my hair with a wide tooth comb and saw that pieces of those fried ends were breaking off!!! I've bleached my hair before and have had very damaged hair, but nothing has ever broken my hair before.<br /><br />I thought that, because of the reviews, it would be a good product! Now I know to just go to Sally's and pay a little bit more for better products.
B004KATJVC|1|They need to go back into the labs and add something more hydrating to this conditoner, it's completely lacking in moisture and leaves your hair frizzy and feeling like straw. Stay away from this product, especially if you have very curly hair.
B0017WGHRU|5|Wish they sold it in stores.
B0020MMCI4|5|I love nautica cologns etc for men. They arnt overwhelmimg in scent nor price. I like the ocean type scent of floral v fruity that mildly lingers but doesnt overwhelm. Try nautica blue too. Very inexpensive but dont be fooled Ive gone by price before... go by your nose
B00O1ARW6U|5|Got it for my sister she can't stop thanking me ..
B00AD5M50U|5|I love the taste of this toothpaste.  I also need to use the Sensitve style toothpastes, but I can no longer find the Arm & Hammer Sensitive in any of the local grocery, drug or any store that carries toothpastes (e.g. Target, WalMart, etc.)
B004JIY8U2|5|I have been using Peace be Still for many years.  I love the fragrance and keep it in my office and in my bedroom.  It is also one of my favorite gifts of choice for birthdays and other celebrations of life.  You can't go wrong with this product. My guess is that you will instantly love it also.  Enjoy!
B00R42M8OS|5|I loved the shampoo and hair mask, and noticed a visible softness, luster and strength in my hair from my first usage. My hair is falling less, and feels smooth. I have used multiple products in the past, and none have delivered these type of results. This hair care system is just wonderful, and delivers the results you have always dreamt of!
B003N4ST94|5|This has a really nice fruity smell, no chemicals at all. It doesn't clump up or irritate my eyes when I rub them like the mascaras purchased at a drug store do. I am sold and will buy more of their products plus this company's items are all made here.
B0057JCYYE|3|This is a real started kit  It does what it says on the tin.  It would have been nice to have included a colour  in the box as well.
B008IHF26Y|5|Nice and sturdy. Fast delivery. Very stylish, easy to set the combination lock. I bought this case to store my private collection of personal items; especially away from the kids. So far this is just perfect.
B00AG979BS|5|Love the skin care and the color. Live in Florida with iron in the water. Does not stain!
B000PXYADK|4|Like that the directions in the enclosed instructions recommend the heat range for different types of hair.  Found that the curls lasted all day, which was a plus.  Good design, easy to handle and store.
B001KOTRJA|5|It is nice. I like it and my husband likes it. and every one that comes near me likes it.
B009NQKKMU|1|Very poor quality
B000C1W2DK|5|Excelente
B004TXY0TG|5|Excellent product, it's a hundred percent guaranteed. Actually, I recommended Kendal to my friend and sister and their planning to buy this product soon.
B002DPUY2E|5|I love Burt's Bees products and this is no exception! It smells great and leaves my baby's skin soft after bath time!
B001F0QX1E|5|Works as advertised.  I'm down to using it every third day without loss of effect.<br />One day I was wearing  black shirt outside in 90+ degree heat and digging holes and STILL didn't have wet spots under my arms!<br />Just makes me think that something that works this well can't be good for you...but we're all going to die from something...at least I'll be dry!
B0017LDF26|5|I knew this color was vibrant but dang! It faded quicker than I would have liked but a lot goes a long way so I could easily redye my (thick) mohawk 2-3 times with one jar. Plus the shades it fades through are nice regardless - win/win!
B0002TSCZY|5|Well to start with I have to tell you about my hair.  I am african-american woman with naturally thick, dense, coily, kinky, curly type 4 hair.  My hair is not chemically processed with relaxers or texturizers and I wanted to enjoy the variety of having my hair straightened every once in a while.  I did a lot of research on flat irons before deciding the Solia may be the one.<br /><br />Now about this Solia flat iron...I am truly impressed.  What I like about it is the fact you have the option of really knowing & choosing how hot you want it.  I mean this thing goes up to 450 in a matter of seconds.  You plug it in, you put the dial on your desired temperature & in next thing you know the light goes from a solid red (heating up) to flashing (ready).  I recommend flat ironing clean slightly damp or dry hair in small sections that are already detangled & heat protected with some spray or serum to achieve the best results.  I originally tried it on a really low setting (I think like 175) and it gave my hair the appearance of a blown out afro because I was afraid of my hair not being able to revert back to its curly state.  The second time I was a bit more daring & wanted that sleek straight look so I had it originally on 450 (i did a hair test & realized it was too hot...i learned my hair likes it around 370) & it came out beautiful.  I was especially impressed with how straight the ends were.<br /><br />I ranted & raved about this thing to all my friends & family like some cult member.  I even used it on my biracial cousin to show her how amazing this product is (she is converted...my mission is working) whose hair is nothing like mine.  Her hair is much finer, although still thick with type 3 hair.  She especially loved that she can create gorgeous curls like a curling iron with it.  Ironically, she can handle 400+ heat.  Who knew right?<br /><br />If I had to say there are any negatives, I wish the cord would swivel because it can become a tangled mess.  On the plus side, I really appreciate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn't pull or snag your hair & is more able to iron the hair evenly.<br /><br />If you are like me constantly checking reviews, doing price comparisons, conducting more research...just do it & buy it already.  Think of all the great hair days you'll be missing out on because you're sitting here reading this.iate the fact that the plates have give to them so it doesn't pull or snag your hair & is more able to iron the hair evenly.

B000P91E4C|1|These sounded good at the time, but I never really found a use for them.  Wish I hadn't ordered them
B000ALDK1A|4|I grow my own Aloe Vera but needed a more convenient application manner.  It is working o.k. but I was disappointed to learn it is 100% Gel NOT 100% Aloe Vera.
B004UKT2PU|5|Instead of spending $10.00 or $12.00 per week at a barber I cut my own buzz cut with this trimmer in a couple of minutes without any complaints so far.
B00AUVMP1G|5|I knew this watch was for me as soon as I laid eyes on it. It has a fun-funky-retro look to it and it looks great wrapped around my wrist! Feels very comfortable on and the watch face is very easy to read.
B003PXZI2O|5|I took a year debating to buy this product. Finally took the plunge and it is everything and more. It is the best product and it does everything it claims. I love it.  It took getting used to the fact that it \\"DOES NOT\\" make suds. But after three washings I never went back. A defined diffference in my hair and I love love love the product.  It is all the \\"infomercial\\" says and more. Don't wait like me \\"just do it\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00188IFHS WEN® Lavender Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]]
B00BG1ZQ2O|5|Good
B000GCXT46|5|My hair is very thin and fine. It only got worse as I have aged and begun taking medications. Every shampoo I have tried for years, even the name brand expensive ones, has left my hair so limp and clinging to my scalp, it looked like it was either wet or dirty and greasy. Wash and curl is the only shampoo that leaves my hair fluffy and good looking.  I don't like to take time fooling with my hair. When I wash it, I simply curl my hair over my ears in a corkscrew wound around my finger and my bangs, just bent over my fingers, and let it dry. When I comb it out, it looks great.<br />It is hard to find anymore, so I try to buy in advance and keep stocked up.
B00121U0ME|5|I would be lost without this product ...it makes your hair so manageable..can not get by with out it. and the price on this 3 packs is unbeatable ...i buy a bunch at a time , that way i never run out....so worth looking into this product...i spray it on and come it into wet hair and then dry , it works the best that way.
B001AA1TKY|4|They are really easy to put on, come with a very good price and free quick shipping. Very good for beginners. The only thing I would say is I'd like them a little thicker and shorter, but that's just my reference.
B003CTTZQQ|4|I am excitedly looking forward to good results from this product for hair care.  I also used this product for a dry skin patch and saw satisfying results.  Look forward to reordering this product for hair care.
B002A5HIYY|5|I think the original order may have been short (thought now I'm not so sure). Contacted seller and they personally loaded another complete order and sent them off. Received in a couple of days. Tatoos (haven't tried yet) seem to be great quality, a little larger than a quarter dollar (maybe an inch or so accross?).<br /><br />Bought to hand out at Holoween 2013.
B00H8Z614E|5|I just whant to say I love the micro collagen booster.  I start use and in 1 week  friends start ask me if I change the facials product.  I feel my skin more smood, bright and crowns feet going way.  around my eyes I can't believe hows this working.  I have been used facial products for years ago, and this one I defenelly recommend .
B006I6Y3U8|5|Smells lovely
B00JLPM8AK|5|Really Great!
B00SZ2P820|5|I love this mascara as I have short, thin lashes. It really makes them look longer and fuller without being all caked up. What I'm not fond of is that throughout the day it leaves black smudges on my upper eyelids. It's rather embarrassing if you don't check yourself in the mirror now and then. It wipes off easily though.
B00017UYMQ|2|I really enjoy this fragrance, however, this time no such luck. It smelled somewhat like what I use to use(china musk)but it seemed less concentrated. Also, the bottles were leaking and I ended with half filled bottles. Oh one more thing, they were both suppose to be sealed, but with one of the bottles, the seal had a tiny pin hole in it and the other had no seal at all...I will not be reordering or even wearing this...
B000ALIL78|5|Razac hand and body lotion is a product that I have used for atleast 15 years.  The first time I used the product I wasn't sure of how good it really was until other people would ask me, \\"what is that you wearing\\", as if I had on some expensive cologne.  As a man it's important to me to be well groomed, moisturized and smelling good.  Razac covers both, and not only that, it mixes with your body chemistry, so no two people will smell the same.  Compliments, compliments compliments!!  Great product for the price!!
B000NRV00Y|4|This was a very good product for my mature, dry, sensitive skin. The body oil was not greasy and it absorbed well into the skin.  .
B008FOQHF0|1|I have yet to receive anything. But they do look cool in the picture - shiny - colorful - inviting - smooth. I would love just to hold one in my hand. So nimble. So today, once again I will sit patiently at the mail box in hopes I may on day receive my purchase........
B000NE6QP6|5|This stuff is great for all hair, and especially curly hair. My hair has never been so healthy looking or soft.<br /><br />WARNING: If you are used to putting products in your hair, you will probably need to cut way back. This stuff doesn't have sulfates/sulfites/etc. so you don't get that foamy lather, and it doesn't strip your hair. This is a *good* thing. However, if you're used to normal shampoos, and you use product with this, then your hair might feel greasy.
B00ESYFMWU|5|SHORT REVIEW: Ive had no infections after two weeks. The guns work. They come with sanitizing wipes. They each have their own individual protective plastic wrapping that appears trustworthy. On the outside of each one, in yet another protective wrapper, is a small sanitized cloth. Piercing was quick, smooth, only briefly painful. This will vary depending on your pain tolerance. I highly recommend these. Save yourself the time and money.<br /><br />LESS SHORT: It came about a month after purchasing. My. mother pierced my ears, and I pierced my brothers. I ordered 4 individual mini-guns, each gun gives you a single piercing. The pain is quick. I had no pain after it was completly in my ears, even now cleaning it every day for 2 weeks, it hurts briefly when I clean it, and less than a few seconds later, it feels normal again. This hurt less and throbbed less than the piercings  I  received from a proffesional. The closest thing to a malfunction was after my mother had pierced my ears, she had some issues taking it off. If you do not press the gun all the way through untill you hear and feel a soft click, the gun wont come down. After i realized this, my brothers piercings had no issues at all, including no jams. Be sure to mark where you will pierce with a dark pen, and if your target requires you to use two mirrors, have a friend help. The tube that contains the front of the earring often obscures your view of the ear when you position it to pierce, and when you must keep tugging the skin into position, it makes it very easy to pierce too high or too low. My mother, unable to see the dot, went noticeably lower on me, but I'm oddly pleased with the effect. The earring itself is silver,  with a small jewel/rhinestone/stone at its center. I will update again if problems arise. I am inspired to do all my future piercings myself because of this.
B00NLRF054|5|Yes! Just what I needed
B0007CXX82|5|The real deal.
B0032ANCUU|5|I've been using it since 1970 and have had no reason to change.
B004DH1ALY|1|Not the product I received. I received the solid bar, because of where I am located I can't return this.
B0046VJU2I|4|Good pigment quality, applies smoothly and blends (with or without a brush) easily and evenly.  Great basic color needed for any makeup collection!
B000GCLRIG|5|Needed a simple lubricant eye ointment to control itchy eyelids....that weren't associated with<br />disease or infection.<br /><br />Did the job and did not add medication to the eye area which was my goal!
B0015NZ6FK|4|Ordered this for my husband.  A first glance he was disappointed that it is quite thick and that the exterior fabric is synthetic.  He was worried it would be too hot and uncomfortable.  However, he has been using it for about a week now, and it seems to help him sleep better between 3:30 and 6 am when the morning sun is coming up.  He also liked that is was made in the USA.  He doesn't wear it all night, but just puts it on around 3am.
B009IZOWDY|5|This is a fantastic product... can't find this value anywhere else.
B005YVTI30|5|I had purchased one of these a number of years ago and it just quit after many years of usage.  I was disappointed that when I went to get a replacement, that it was extremely hard to find.  I didn't like the current styles that were on the market.  I was very excited to find that I could get one through Amazon.  It was exactly what I expected.  I am very happy to have found this style again and very pleased with the results that I get using it.  Well worth the money.
B0020MMCJI|3|I loved it, just what I wanted
B000QF95G4|5|This is a great product to give ummph to styles.  After I give my limp hair a curl, I add a touch of this to give definition to my style.
B000301YWU|5|Daughter loves it and now wont loose it at school. Came with extra free lip balm
B00VSQK31G|5|Best price for doing my own hair. It's fun and cheap to do. Shipped fast. It's in English and Chinese but can't beat the price!
B009KBMWCY|4|I have to say that I do LOVE this mascara, BUT, make sure you have some time to put it on at first b/c it may take a little practice.  My instructions were also in Chinese, but knowing so many people that have used it, I was able to figure it out pretty well.  I recommend a VERY light coat of your own mascara before starting.  Then, while your mascara is still wet, put on the transplanting gel (which is black so it helps work with the mascara).  BEFORE ANYTHING DRIES, pull out your fibers brush.  Like I said, this is the tricky part just until you get used to it and find the right routine that works for you.  The fibers are loose but they stick to the brush somewhat like dust sticks to a Swiffer.  Take your fibers brush and generously apply the fibers to the still wet transplanting gel - TAKE YOUR TIME!!!  Once you've completed, use your transplanting gel again to seal them or they will shed like CRAZY!! Keep repeating these steps until you have your desired look.  You may need to apply more fibers and keep repeating the steps if you want the glamorous \\"going out\\" look, whereas you may only need one coat for things like going to work.  This is something I LOVE about this stuff b/c I can use the same product to achieve totally different looks. I've seen alot of comments about getting this in your eyes and how badly it would burn, etc.  I wear contacts and have VERY sensitive eyes and although some of the fibers did get into my eyes a little, it was not painful and really I could barely feel anything.  If you wear contacts, you know even an eyelash can feel like someone is stabbing you in the eye - this was NOT the case with these \\"lash\\" fibers.  This really does make your lashes really LONG and glamorous but if you don't take your time, it can come out clumpy.  Also, when applying you may have some of the lash fibers that drop off of the brush onto your face, but I used a q-tip, got one side barely damp and left the other side dry and between the two, the fibers comeoff very easily without removing the rest of my make-up.  If you need lash boosts for volume as well as length like I do, you will probably want to use your volumizing mascara first.  This product helps more with the length than the volume.  Once you're done however and the transplanting gel is dried - your lashes are sealed and I can tell you THEY STAY!!  I went out and forgot to wash my face before going to bed and woke up with still pretty long lashes!!  Everything does wash off VERY easily with baby shampoo or eye makeup remover.  All in all, it may not be perfect, but, if you want long glamorous lashes without having to super-glue fake ones on you need THIS!!!  And these don't destroy your own lashes like the super glued fake ones.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c if you're in a real hurry, you're VERY likely to mess this up and just look like straight clumps.  Anytime I buy a new product though, I make sure I have PLENTY of time to test and try it as like a \\"trial run\\" but once you get a routine down, there won't be anything else to it.
B002LE54P4|1|Agree with some of the other posts, this made my eyes very dry which made the wrinkles appear much worse.  I don't know if this is the real Lumiere product (others on this site have claimed it's a cheap and poor attempt at copying).  Definitely not satisfied and definitely would not purchase again.
B004CNG2XA|5|I am so happy with this purchase!  it fits just right under my counter in my bathroom .... adjustable ht works great.  very nice sized seat and color is terrific and material is easy to clean if needed.  love wheel base and convenience of rolling around!!!
B001TVURXY|4|I like this conditioner for my very fine, thin hair. This conditioner does kill static electricity and add softness and a touch of volume to my hair. It does not make my hair greasy at all. I think this John Frieda works as well or better than many of the much more expensive brands.<br /><br />My only complaint is the fragrance. It sort of reminds me of a pine scent or some earthy/woodsy odor. I can't smell the conditioner after my hair is dry, but I don't enjoy the fragrance in the shower. It's not enough to make me discontinue using this product, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that maybe they will update this product with a milder fragrance.
B003O493FM|5|This is an amazing product that is affordable and it works!  I suggest anyone with scalp issues to buy it and use it once a week for relief.
B0047639Y2|5|This purchase was a great deal. I was able to get five deodorants for twenty-five dollars. This is a savings of at least fifteen dollars. I was pleased with the fast shipment as well.
B001E38194|5|great product
B004BUBROS|1|Soo i bought these they are not nice at all! I have used them once and hair is falling out! I bought brown and it isnt brown at all! I will not ever buy them again
B00BJ69OT2|5|This is the best texture mist I've used in years.  Absolutely love this product.
B00GY96X3E|5|This wasn't available for the longest time (well, at least a couple of years), but now it's back! And it's absolutely the best way to power through silicone lube to get truly clean without the annoying residue. Smells good, gentle on sensitive skin, and just a small dime-sized drop goes a long way, letting you get a lot of uses out of each bottle. This is an essential product.
B002LPC8O8|5|I have had this razor for years and just needed a new blade and new foil!  perfect!
B00JT6036C|5|This is the best cream I have ever used!  It has a wonderful smell.  It makes my face feel so fresh and clean!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that want to try something new!  Thank you for such a good product!
B001FWXIEW|3|I ordered this product due to the low price that was offered and the difference between the price in the store. I was happy with the product except for the fact that the spray nozzle located on the bottle keeps falling off. Due to it falling off it is hard to get the cologne out of the bottle and you have to position it so it does not spray all over. It also leaks out on the bottle when sprayed from the nozzle.
B004BNRQ5O|1|Tried switching to this from an alum crystal product because what's more natural than salt? But unfortunately it doesn't kill bacteria or fight odor for me, unlike the alum, which worked great. So maybe I'll wash it and leave for the deer as a salt lick.
B00C9G4FQS|5|We looked at several models and took a risk on this one. Well when it arrived, my wife was delighted to see so many pockets for her jewelry. Great for travel.
B00CFCP650|5|Love this and it smells amazing
B0056GDG90|3|You are unable to clean easily.  Can't was in water.
B003YMJJSK|4|Good product! Recommended by my dermatologist!
B00KQWBJ5W|5|yes ,I love this product but the scent was just too strong and not a good smelling one for me.  In the future I will try some of the other products they make. Also the money back returns are true 100 %,....
B000E7WHLY|5|long lasting .. cool perfume
B0009OAGZG|5|I love this fragrance. The price matched my needs and the shipping process was fast. Fragrance Hugo Boss original for the most part.
B00Q1BCVKY|4|easy use for my hydrosol mask
B00V6JITR0|5|Product came but its not black. It's a yellow white color; ugly color but the product works fine, sharpens my eyeliner great!
B001CT07Z6|5|Bought this for my Mom. Parfum is so much more expensive than toilette, and this price was cheaper than all the other toilettes! I got a great deal and my mom was ecstatic!
B00ISEOY20|5|very good ! I will buy it in next time.
B006OR4W6Q|3|Not as strong as the one I bought in the store. I feel like it was diluted but still alright
B00763LZWQ|4|It's a toothbrush, what else can I say about them?
B00JJ1W3CO|5|love biosilk but would really like to have the 10 oz spray....
B00MW5B9JC|5|Love this one, it does everything I want it to do, love it, will be buying another one.
B00QXIDW2G|5|I have been trying many beard oils over the last few months. I love the feel and natural smell of the Smooth Viking Oil. It apply's nice and thick leaving a smooth feeling on my beard throughout the day.
B0054L8L1A|5|Fast delivery and as described, but bottle has changed.<br /><br />I have been using this for 3 years. It works great in my hair and is not heavy.
B009DQJ1AM|5|This half wig is easy to wear and style.  It fits snugly. I have already purchased a second wig.  I highly recommend it.
B00GHXH0VQ|4|Love the shampoo. It lathers very well, fresh and thickens my hair.  Not sure if I like the conditioner. It's thick but takes a lot to coat hair. Seems like it soaks right in and you can't tell it's in hair.
B00C3GQN5U|1|ugh
B007RIC79K|5|Only product I can use for sensitive skin. Live it!
B0043T2K7K|5|Awesome dryer!  It is a touch heavy, but I have learned that for my volume of hair and waviness I have to have a more powerful dryer which means a bit more weight.  This dryer gets my hair straighter than any other dryer I have ever used.  It really blows out my waves and give it that super sleek look.  I've been using the same products and boar bristle brush hoping to get that salon blown out look...this dryer finally helped me achieve that look.<br /><br />Can't vouch for how long it will last, I think it had a pretty good warranty so hopefully I will get a few years use out of it.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|Very good quality for the price. cleans way better than you would if you were manually brushing. Definitely recommended. It charges via the stand which is pretty cool and it starts and ends after 2 minutes which is the recommended brushing time
B0009TNCKW|5|Cannot buy this Maxx Factor product in the States any longer!
B0059JS4F0|5|After 2 weeks of this wonderful product i realize my hair is now growing healthy and thick !!<br />Amazing !
B008KSEZLO|5|I have not been enjoying how yellow my teeth are becoming since I can't really whiten with my Invisalign bumps (attachments glued onto my teeth) using my usual Crest Whitestrips 2 hour treatment. I drink black coffee M-F and just life in general helps stain them<br /><br />I stumbled on this product and saw the great reviews and decided to try it out<br /><br />I like that the syringes are filled to order and it's delivered in a timely manner. I would recommend buying this in the colder months since you need to refrigerate these little guys.<br /><br />Some oozed out when i took off the tip but it's not surprising. I think the directions that come with it could be written a bit better and simply as bullet points or something.<br /><br />The pink tip dispensed the gel effectively into my Invisalign but since the trays snap into place, a bunch of the gel got spattered out onto my gums which I immediately felt. I think that just comes with the territory since I put the trays in as gently as I could.<br /><br />I definitely felt sensation (like pins and needles) for about 5 minutes but I have a few areas with receding gums which makes my teeth kind of sensitive to start with. The initial 10 minutes went by really quickly and I felt no pain or sensitivity afterwards. I didn't do such a great job with a few spots missed but I think there's a slight learning curve.<br /><br />My teeth seem a bit brighter and I'm looking forward to seeing the end results once I'm done with all 5 syringes<br /><br />All in all, I think $25 for the amount you get with the effectiveness of the product itself is a total steal!!
B00FRLV5RO|3|Granted, it's a neat picture, that's it.  I personally don't feel it's worth the amount of money it's being sold for.  It's supposed to be luminous.  The cool images in Amazon showing it in daylight and in darkness really got me.  Yeah, it got me.  I tried shining a very high intensity work light on it for a long time, the best I could get was half of the boat would slightly glow along with a very small portion of the boardwalk, that's it, and it only lasted about five minutes, woopdy doooooooo.  It's a neat picture, not a painting, it fits the room I wanted it for, I just won't be telling anyone that it's supposed to glow in the dark.
B001MA0QY2|5|Wonderful product!  Does a beautiful job straightening my naturally curly hair.
B000CEOU3M|3|It's a comb. But good luck getting the color you actually request! I bought a purple one and got a blue one (which is actually way darker than the picture shows). But whatever. It's a $5 comb.
B00BPAO48S|5|Fast shipment, and a very nice product. The TOBS was a very nice summer scent, and again. Fast shipment over the summer. No shaving cream issues with summer heat
B003UGV05U|5|This is my holy grail of hair products. I use it every day before flat ironing my hair and it does a great job protecting my hair from heat damage. I would not use a flat iron without it.
B009U07WE8|3|This is the second time I've purchased this offsite from a salon and each time the shampoo and/or conditioner always leaks from the top.
B00N2PQ25M|5|I have a really small bathroom so was looking for something to hold my hairdryer.  This did the trick.  Easy to install.  Once installed it can rotate to fit whatever direction you need.
B0016ZNWMG|2|My daughters hair still felt like it had a residue on it and the sheen has been lost. It also didnt seem as managable as with other low/no poo lines I have tried. I have been using low poo and no poo shampoos on her hair for almost a year now, so I don't think it is a transition issue.
B0051PLB1Q|1|I am sorry to say this sunscreen did not live up to my hopes. I bought it because it is highly recommended as a natural sunscreen. It is certainly not normal sunscreen, it is more like toothpaste. It is a paste that does not rub in and collects every speck of dirt and bugs that may be flying around near you. I had to wash my face 10+ times scrubbing at it to get this stuff off.
B0041T7BAS|3|Took out some of the perm but not all.
B0012ZS30G|4|It's fine. My hair remained healthy as I used this product. I switched to Moroccan Oil products for a while, but now I'm back (AA with relaxed hair).
B00325D0WK|5|I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I have seen a remarkable difference in my lashes.  I love it and I would  recommend it to everyone.  My friend  just bought this same product and her salon and it was about $20.00 more.
B0012C8TXU|5|Love how it moisturizes your skin. Not sure how I like the fragarance. I have used another kind of hemp moisturizer. I think it was a tropical scent. Loved that too.  I'm not sure if that one is by Autralian Gold or not.
B0019QHUTI|5|Great product, not for wimpy people those, let my nephew try some and he ran back home and showered to try to cool down, this is only for people who have a good base, not for beginners, it is a intense tingle that will stay with you for few hours after, it is better not to use on your face as you will feel flush till it wears down, what some other reviews were talking about heat stroke, if you want to take it to next level get it a try, i tried single package at the salon before i bought it, i paid $6 bucks for like 1/2 ounce and the salon wants more than 2 times the amount you can get it at Amazon for.
B00B43KQ2O|5|Love it!  Comb, not a brush applicator, but I immediately adapted.<br />NO smudging or sticking to areas above or below the eye.  Unlike other brands with fibers, this one does not make individual eyelashes look \\"furry\\" - lashes are shiny, separated and natural looking.<br />I wear it everyday; removal is a breeze with an oil or cream based remover.
B00009RB0Y|5|Another ripped foil, so I finally relented and gave this Norelco a spin.  I'm not sure why I've gone out of my way to avoid this particular razor for the past 40 years--probably because of its dorky looks.  Face it, it's just not very \\"masculine\\" in its appearance--more ovarian than phallic, more like the grail than the lance.  But if you're willing to sacrifice form to function, this razor can't be beat.  It's the first one that caught every single hirsute strand on my neck in a single pass.<br /><br />If you're beardless and unmustachioed, the Norelco is a bonafide no-brainer.  If you've got a number of hedges to trim around, the Norelco doesn't give you as clear a view or precise a cut as a more conventionally shaped Braun, Remington, or Panasonic.  On the other hand, the pop-out trimmer is the best I've ever seen, perfect for weeding out, pruning, shaping those less accessible areas.<br /><br />As for spending fifteen to twenty bucks more for the next higher model (6843XL), the only difference I can see is color (blue instead of silver metallic) and a faster charging time (perhaps useful to those testosterone-rich individuals who require a shave every hour).
B007RIEYGO|5|Great moisturizer!  Have been using it for years.  Very fast shipping.
B000BTO6CI|5|Can you believe the price is so low. I love this Parfum. It smells like Lily of the Valley. It stays on and is devine
B002FBXPJU|5|I LOVE IT!!!! It is one of my favorites. The seller performed very well. I received the items I purchased sooner than was projected and I am very please with my purchases!<br /><br />Thank You!
B00J86HFB4|5|Really works well!
B0089JVEOK|5|My wife loves it!   We would like to order more than 5 at a time and how about free shipping?
B0017WIKBG|3|In Greece you will not find the &#34;pure sport&#34; version of this deodorant these days, only &#34;white water&#34; is sold in the market. I really liked the &#34;pure sport&#34; perfume much more than &#34;white water&#34; that 's why I bought it from the internet. This product is a mix between the &#34;pure sport&#34; I used to know and the &#34;white water&#34;. Better than &#34;white water&#34; but not perfect : 
B001768FK8|4|H 2 ION works so well in my overly processed, thin and fragile hair.<br />Problem is,, it stretches my budget.. the container has malfunctioned on<br />two occassions, making it impossible to get product out of container.<br />This is a horrible outcome for something so expensive.. And forget trying<br />to get replacement or consideration from the company..<br />My search is on for a better customer service situation, so I can<br />at least know I will have product I pay for.. or option for<br />an easy replacement/return.. Disappointed, because this is really a<br />good product..
B002ROMF0A|5|Awesome hairspray - My go to hair product!!
B007152I9S|5|I got this mascara after reading a review on it. It's a really good mascara! I use it, along with another mascara, to plump and lengthen my lashes. This mascara does a really good job at the lengthening part. It has little fibers in it that stick to your eyelashes-- something I hadn't been warned about., I thought I had a bunch of what I call &#34;fuzzies&#34; in it and was wondering how they got there since I wasn't wearing clothing that shed too much. I really like this product and will definitely buy it again when I run out!<br /><br />Also, something else I wasn't warned about: it's water proof, and most asian mascaras and eyeliners are, so when shopping keep that in mind.<br /><br />If your eyelash game is week and fragile (like mine can be), this is not an everyday product for you since removing waterproof eyeliner requires some rubbing and general irritation of the eyelashes.
B00OIUBYYO|3|I've tried both the Forest and Night scents. First, the good: the spray does go on dry as promised. The canister also has a cool design to expose and hide the spray nozzle. The bad: Both scents are extremely overpowering. I prefer the Forest to the Night, but it's like spraying an strong body spray on your armpits. The spray also fills the room and your nostrils, as a result. I also didn't have much luck with this acting as an effective antiperspirant.
B0083KS3FS|4|It was good
B006YI7LDQ|5|Great
B001BBRUTQ|5|I have used this product for years.  It is just the right shade and not too dark.
B0017IE2RG|5|The product reduced my ingrown hairs to an occasional few. I used Oxy years ago and it was pulled off the market.  However, I am thrilled to have reconnected with this wonderful product. Truly an early Christmas present.
B00170MAFK|5|I brought these rollers because I can never find them in the store. My grandmother and great aunt use these to roll their relaxed hair. Best purchase ever. They were glad I finally found these rollers. Best used with hair pins.
B004I7XBX4|5|If you are tired of putting eye drops in all day due to dry eyes, try these. I add one drop every morning. You can use these on other eye colors besides blue. My daughter uses them and she has brown eyes. The whites of you eyes are bright and all the red is kept away all day!
B000JIAO8Q|5|I've been using this cream for a few weeks now and I have to tell you, I really really LOVE it.  I have oily skin and had concerns this product may not work but I've been proven wrong.  It's absorbed nicely into the skin, doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  There's a scent to it I can't quite describe but I don't find it offensive or a turn off either.  I have noticed a difference in my skin in the short time I've used it and it seems to have helped with my t-zone troubles as well.
B008RJGLPE|5|I love the way ProGenius makes my skin feel - so soft, so clear.  I use 2 drops in the a.m. before my moisturizer (need my spf!) and another 2-3 drops at night.  Its results are similar to Nude's Advanced Night Oil they used to have.  There are not many products I would spend $78 on but this? I'll definitely splurge again!
B00B187C9M|1|I received the comb and very disappointed. First of all, it is cracked on the top where two pieces are glued together. Secondly, the teeth are so sharp. It really hurts when I try to use it. This comb tears off my hair due to the rough surface of the teeth. I'm going to return it.<br />But I have to mention that Neem wood has a nice scent.
B008A3YO2Y|5|Love this polish, its the same polish that the nail shop use. the polish goes on smooth apply 2 coats and your good to go. the price is great and the shipping experience was good 2 because nothing came in broke thank goodness.
B00AFMUNJG|5|Wonderful packaging. The scent is really interesting and slightly sweet. It is a tiny bit musky but in a present contemporary way.
B004BUY5RY|5|I really like this foundation. After deliberating, I ordered the white peach tint instead of the creme. I was half expecting the color to be too dark because I'm pretty pale, but it's a great match for me. It neutralizes redness on your skin but doesn't look orange, which is awesome. I also use a moisturizer before I apply this. When it's on it has the feeling of powder instead of a cream or liquid foundation which can sometimes be too moisturizing for me as I have medium/oily skin. I could see how this foundation might be a bit drying for some people with already-dry skin, but it works very well for me. Doesn't irritate, has a pleasant smell and it's much more natural than the high-end toxic cosmetics that I was paying a ton of money for before.
B001FYZTEW|5|For longer natural looking lashes, these are my go to.  Great quality.
B001ET7BZS|5|This is the best scent ever.
B004OEGRD2|3|I have to say the product I purchased via amazon at a fraction of the price I paid at the actual vendor makes sense, it was not of the same quality.  I purchased the lifting moisturizing cream through amazon once or twice now, and I will never do it again.  I am back to paying the full price for the Gratiae line because not only do I love them that much, but I refuse to be fooled and buy an imitation. I will be calling amazon in the future to ask about the credibility of the seller of this cream. As Gratiae strongly advises that they are the only authorized seller of their products and that no other seller is the same, I now know they mean it.  This is very different than the version you pay serious money for, and it also does not deliver like the version that costs a lot more.  It seems diluted at best, and was a waste of money. I used at least four times the amount of the cream from amazon as I did the actual from the Gratise kiosk at my mall. Sorry amazon, it's nothing on you- just the vendor it is from I guess.
B00H7YZ7LO|5|Excellent!!  Hair feels real and bulky unlike the kind they sell at the beauty shops.  Highly recommend and very true to color.
B00008IM9W|4|It works as it says. The only thing I wish it had was a little water to help out the process.  Follow the instructions and it should work for you.
B00PVNEGZ6|5|I was asked to review this make up palette as a promo deal but all opinions are my own!  Wonderful neutral color eye shadows to choose from. Will complement most skin tones. The case is definitely travel size. It easily fits in my little pouch inside my purse. Several shades of lip glosses are in the kit, which I appreciate as I don't love a lot of colors on my lips. The blush had a coral undertone but blended on my cheeks perfectly. Overall a smooth application for all the make up. The promo also came with powder in two colors. A lighter and darker which with help as my skin changes during summer. And wasn't at all cakey. It does come with an eye shadow applicator but I prefer my own brushes and sponges. I let my daughter take it and she loves it. The only thing I had to add was some mascara and my look was complete!
B00NFVHY6E|5|Good
B0045WBARQ|5|Use these for putting crystals on badges. They are the perfect size for it and are good quality, as opposed to some others I have tried.
B006L035LO|5|I bought these for the price just to try and was totally amzed at how easy they applied ... the glue that came with the product was dried out but that ok  i used DUo eyelash glue instead anywyas ... they stayed on all day and i reused them ... treat em nice and u can reuse if u like ... i will buy more soon  great for everyday use.  thanks
B003U8K6M6|5|I've had it for more than four years now, still works great!
B008Q025UE|1|I read all of these glowing reviews, which led me to purchase this product.  I can only ask:  Who are you people, and HOW can you say this product works??!!  It made my naturally curly hair, sticky, kinky, gross and greasy. It also smells terrible!!!  I followed instructions to the last detail.  It is horrible.  I'm running back to the arms of my wonderful Morrocan hair mask, and never looking back!!! Bottom line:  yuk!!!  One star BC I couldn't figure out how to do half star, for quick delivery.
B0026MV5V8|4|To save the time of buying the same sample pack, I highly recommend the BIC brand razor blades.  If you are more curious, this sample pack is worth buying.
B001TBQ328|5|I used Maybelline brow color until the company discontinued the product.  Jane Iredale Pure Brow saved the day.  I have blond brows that do not complement my eyes.  This product is necessary for completing my daily makeup routine.  I love the way it doesn't harden.  It's just the right texture.
B003BQMVO8|3|I must have terrible hand eye coordination because I find this bottle difficult to use on my self.  I prefer the bowl and a brush for application but it's probably just my clumsiness.
B004WSQUSW|5|I've never purchased shea butter before, but have heard a lot about the benefits. What I liked about this seller is that they were doing something for a good cause and that they didn't have a lot of crazy hype about the product. Everything was pretty much straight forward.     The shea butter is pretty smooth and creamy like they said it was, not gritty-and I agree about the label. Lol. It arrived faster than I thought it would. It has a nice smell. I just have to rub it in my hands a little and put it on my face and body. I like it and my wife does too. She said it was good...so I'm good. I would definitely buy from this seller again. I hope this helps.
B0077PG3DY|5|I am extremely allergic to PPD & PTD and have been struggling for a long time to find a product that covers grey hair.<br />I just tried Tints of Nature and couldn't be happier with the results!!!<br />Thank you so much for thinking about the rest of us!!!! I am really excited to find a solution for my problem!
B00HCMRHBY|5|OPI nail products are considered the best by most professional manicurists.  I chose this kit because of the brand, and,the price couldn't be beaten.  I was a little leary of this kit because of the price.  However,  I have been using it for nearly a month, am tough on my nails, and wanted to go with the gel polishes since they don't chip the next day.  I was not disappointed.  The light works as it should and the two colors that came with it are very pretty.
B004GQZX4M|5|[[ASIN:B007RDOWY8 Knot Genie Detangling Brush (Puff of Purple)]]I love this product.  No more tears from my granddaughter when I comb her hair now.
B00373FE76|5|THIS is a must have for anyone who hates plucking their eyebrows. I didn't use this for filling in my brows or drawing brows on. What I did was I took a white eye liner and then matched the stencil to my brow colored my brow white (everything inside the stencil) then plucked everything not colored. I could never get my eyebrows the same trying to free hand so this works great for showing me what and what not to pluck. I have a variety of brow shapes so They dont have to be the same everytime.
B000NL3RJM|5|Love this color!
B005FG4OME|5|I love this nail polish! All of the colors are beautiful and it stays bright and fresh for at least 2 weeks.
B007QZAVU6|5|A small amount to apply goes a long way. I usually go with natural look and this shade is perfect for my skin type.
B0013F8JXG|4|Love the smell and it very unique. It has this classy gentlemen scent. I hope its legit and the real thing but the smell doesn't last as i thought it would.I mean i didn't pay much for it. So i don't want to really complain. but next time I will go to a department store and buy to see the difference if there's any.
B002XQ1VAM|5|Love this. It's my second bottle.
B00MPXP8AW|5|i like it
B00SKQFT4I|5|Love this hair dryer. Dries my hair in no time
B006VDOPPQ|1|i have to say this is partially my fault as i had read the reviews but i went ahead a bought it, the cream did make my skin darker and i am still trying to fix it
B000P250ZI|5|I first received this fragrance as a gift.  I instantly adored it and now has been my go to fragrance for about 7 years.  I always get compliments and asked what I'm wearing when I have this on.
B004ZOR6MM|5|I bought this product from J&R directly as it seemed I could save some processing time , perhaps not true, but it said so. Anyway, I had Wahl hair trimmer for over 8 years now and it is still like new. Fantastic product and it was USA made.<br />This Li-Pro  seems great too, quite and well made. It is Made in Germany and the charger it comes with works on international voltage 110V-220V 50/60Hz (stamped on the charger), which is great; you'd just need a plug adaptor. I couldn't find any written information on that and J&R even told me it is not true, but it is and eventually Wahl confirmed it as well. The device comes with a nice black round stand that holds the oil and the brush, but there is no pouch or anything like that included for the 6 spacers or the trimmer itself. I love the product and recommend it.
B00FMG8OXM|3|Great look but very hard to cut out the individual sections as they are too close to each other on the backer.  Very easy to apply to skin and I actually did apply it over white face make up and it stayed on all night.  They do send 2 identtical Tattoos in the kit which is also beneficial
B008LQSOJO|5|Very cute! Will work perfect for vacations and keeping everything together. Looking forward to using it this next vacation trip
B002PR2GLM|2|Made my hair very greasy compared to other argan oils I have used.
B005WKFS6E|5|Super shampoo and conditioner -
B000UUMXQE|4|My friend accidentally left this at my house and I used it so I bought one more and sent it to her house. I really liked it!
B003U28VJW|5|I originally heard of this product from my dermatologist, but the they want over double the price!  I have used this product of over three years and love it!  It smells great and keeps my face looking hydrated and smooth.
B000P20UCG|4|Pure Turquoise is a clear, clean floral scent, then dries to a woody scent. On the one hand, it's almost like touching a turquoise stone - cool. On the other hand, it seems like an aquatic floral on me. My skin amplifies the white florals - orange blossom, lily, catcus flowers, plus rose. Dries to a vanilla woody scent, but in a bizarre twist, RL Pure Turquoise often reminds me of brandy & coke. I like it but it's too floral in the heart and too weak at the base for me to love.<br /><br />To me, Pure Turquoise isn't the American Southwest, but it does transport me to another place. It's more like a white floral symphony next to the ocean, complete with deep breaths of fresh air & ocean wind blowing in my hair. I can see & smell sand, but it's marine sand not desert sand.<br /><br />Pure Turquoise wears close to the skin with good longevity. Once dried & the florals have had their say, it's close to a second skin on me. I consider it a personal indulgence or an experience, rather than a scent that projects an image, style, or personality. Personally, I like it, but it doesn't always wear well on me. When I don't care for it, it's too white floral in the heart and too weak at the base for me to love. Otherwise, it's 5* all the way.
B00CQD3M0E|4|Actually makes my nice hair clash with my bashed up face. I may do a Cousin It style if this keeps up.
B003L08IKU|5|This is even better than I expected.  I am caring for my elderly Mom who needs it to be 89 degrees in here... this saves my life.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who has any cooling need... especially those of us dealing with menopause!
B00EVFY722|5|perfect fit and durable
B009WJCEMM|2|I bought this for my clients. I figured it was worth a try especially for the price. Sadly the pigmentation is simply not there in 90% of the glosses. Though they all have great shine. It isn't something I would repurchase and I wouldn't recommend it.
B00D879BFW|5|Works! I really like it, takes away blackheads, but a little hard to peel off.
B0064TWUPO|1|Check your machine, we got one and there's no serial # on it. I was mad as it's a Prime product which Amazon should ensure its genuine. I returned it and am waiting for the \\"genuine\\" replacement. Man, that was a surprise birthday gift for my wife, now I guess she has to be surprised again.
B004LPWBMK|3|Had to have something to please my in-laws so it works but I hate covering my tattoos
B002PILRG6|4|I wish they were just a *tad* sweeter smelling, but they are very relaxing and they keep my brother's tobacco smell at bay.
B001ET769O|5|Everything was great. It was the exact original lotion I had been searching for. Thanks for a superb transaction.
B00OMXW9HS|5|Exactly what I wanted at a good price.
B002ZU4T96|5|I don't use waterproof often but I liked the way it went on better than my regular mascara. Had more fibers and my lashes looked fuller. However I layer my mascara and take lots of time to put on. Nice to have a good looking waterproof
B0017JT964|5|Fast shipping. Cologne is perfect,  great price.
B004D93RFO|5|Love these flat irons, enough heat to get the job done. Doesn't burn or dry your hair out. Great buy for the price. Selling for 100+ dollars in stores.
B00N8LSRI0|2|Way smaller than I expected.
B0021EV2C8|5|I started using Crabtree when I was in UK and I still do. I received a sample of Aveda Calming Body Cleanser and it had some plant smell to it so I was afraid of using since it smelled like a light perfume. Finally one day I tried the Aveda Cleanser and could not believe the feel of it. Not only it did not itch my skin, it felt extremely smooth and I have been using it since. Aveda (US), Crabtree (UK) and SebaMed (Germany) are truly fine companies. Aveda and SebaMed keep producing the same product all the time but Crabtree unlike most companies keeps coming up with different scents. Make sure to check prices before making a purchase.
B006D0POUW|2|It says on the back to put on before sleeping but I shower when I wake up so the majority of the deoderant comes off my armpits. After I take a shower I put some on before I leave but the smell of it is really really strong. Try another deoderant.
B000HGIQRG|5|Works as needed, no problems. Cheaper than going to a store and buying individual bars.
B002WVBEH8|4|GOOD ITEM MOUNTED ON WALL LOOKS GOOD A LITTLE LIGHTWEIGHT. I DISPALYED CND AND OPI POLISHES ON IT FIT JUST FINE.
B00OYVZ6UA|4|Took a few days for the conditioner to make my hair soft. I'm assuming it's because my hair was that dry/damaged.  Other than that, great smell and product.
B00B7HCAJ4|1|it does not mean it is a bad product - just not for dry, sensitive skins.  Kind of ironic in a way since dry, sensitive skins are the ones in need of healing...
B0083WFIO0|4|Nice , love the smell
B008RTNSJQ|3|It's not a big deal to me because I knew the product wouldn't be all that great. People, its $4. Not very shape & cheaply made. Doesn't cut through gel, doesn't cut clean. But hey, it's $4 so what do you expect.
B002T7R3AC|5|Very good product.  Quick delivery.  Excellent value ......
B001GSJD30|5|I am so glad I bought this!  It has made me feel 5 years younger as I look more refreshed.  The easy instructions included in the kit make the application process a breezy and have taught me a few useful tricks.  I will never wear makeup without primer again...fine line begone!
B00F51RET4|5|Fantastic for the price, and go the job done.  I used these cotton balls for removing eye makeup and applying skin toner.
B005SPMINY|2|Not impressed. Seems to be runny and not easy to use.
B004Y9GY44|4|This works better than any dark circle concealer I have used.  I still have dark circles but not as bad.
B00KXETUYU|2|smaller than expected.  lights didn't work ever.  returned for full refund.  only sits at one angle when using kickstand.
B000C1VWSG|2|some perfumes get that been sitting on the shelf too long smell and that is exactly how this smelt as soon as i got it. would not buy from this seller again.
B00OJRZJUG|5|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. very nice products! His beard is soft and well groomed.
B005VGOBJY|5|We will see if we need it.
B001E96OUQ|5|You don't have to use this shampoo every day to get great results.  I use it about twice a week and it keeps the buildup off my hair, leaving it clean and shiny.
B005OZH88I|3|This product was great like all the Sigma brushes I have bought, but was too similar to another brush I already have. I returned this brush.
B006KTTGC8|5|Best. Mascara. Ever. seriously it works wonders. gets them super long and not to heavy. doesn't clump either.
B00028QFAY|2|I thought that this \\"crystal body deodorant\\" would be like the last one I bought, which lasted me YEARS!<br /><br />However, instead of a solid crystal that was pushed up by a plastic screw, this item is a roller-ball on top of a bottle of liquid. How is THAT a \\"crystal body deodorant\\"?<br /><br />Moreover, my underarm hairs sometimes get caught in the roller ball, which is NOT a pleasant sensation.<br /><br />Overall, this was a big disappointment.
B00HG1JFXY|5|This product worked amazingly, I suffer from early balding no more. My hair is thicker, stronger, fuller then it has been in a while.<br /><br />Thank You Ultrax Labs
B00CTQBXLS|5|Great product! Easy to use and I can tell a difference in just one week! I like that you can leave it on and sleep in it.
B002ZNJI5S|5|Bought to learn new hair do's for my eight year old she does not want me &#34;practicing&#34; on her This was the next best thing!
B00DG0YII6|4|Love this stuff! I buy it by the case! Washes of cleanly. Does that it's supposed to do and that's wash off the VA. Summer humidity cleanly, and without that soapy slim I seem to get with all these new &#34;moisturizing soaps&#34; for men.
B001L9FZDG|5|Can't say enough about this product.  I'm a guy and I used to have a ton of breakouts.  I have large pores on my cheeks so I end up getting a ton of dirt, oil, and all sorts of build up in my pores.  I can feel the dead skin and dirt on my face at the end of the day and as soon as I wash my face with this Avon Pore Cleanser my face feels so clean and it is so smooth.  My face has never been healthier since I've started using this product.
B00DIIKTOS|5|I choose this rating because the wig fits snug on your head, it does not shed, nor tangle and it looks very realistic.  Ever one is asking me if it is remi hair or even if it is my own hair.  I am so in love with it I wore it every day last week and this week.  It does not have my head hot like some wigs I have tired.  I would definitely recommend this product to every one.  It is not too long and it is very manageable.  I do not dislike anything about the wig only that I wish that it would be sold in a color like burgundy 1B/33 or 1/4 just like the photo being displayed. To this date march 7th 2014 I still have the wig still wears it every day.  it has now started to shed, nothing that you cannot manage.  It is probably by combing and brushing it.  I maintain this wig by putting it is 4 flexible orange rods each night and this gives me curl that last the whole day or even longer.  Try your best not to put any oils on this wig because it was start to come apart.  I hope this review has been helpful.
B003ZW2M5Q|5|Such a beautiful color. I am very pleased with this nail polish. It was just the type of silver color I was looking for. Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed!!!
B0031NP5TO|3|Wave shaper works albeit very temporarily. At least with my hair. Not worth the money. Maybe it would work better if I used even more—but that is NOT in the budget. Too expensive.
B00CXWSYOC|5|I love this brush set! I use them on my clients and the application is beautiful!  No lines from the foundation brush and the powder brush blends seamless for an air brushed look.Excellent quality and I would definitely recommended to other make-up artists or beginner looking for quality brushes at a great price.
B00LVPDBA4|4|It is good , but the noise is a bit bigger.
B000FCY95A|4|It seems all products that block out the sun go on very heavy but at least I have not broken out from this one. I will be testing this cream when I go to Aruba to see if actually does block the sun. So far I like it.
B005SPMINY|1|Caused a horrible skin reaction on my neck, and I mean horrible.  Not attesting to the product, just a warning to be very careful if you have sensitive skin.
B00IZJZRFQ|1|Item does not fit a hairdryer properly and therefore falls off. Unlike the shown picture, the longer tube is blocked off by a plastic mesh that isn't removable. Because of that the hair section doesn't have space to twist to create the desired result. There's a long and thin plastic stick that suppose to attach to the longer tube so strands of hair would twist around it. That stick doesn't fit either.
B004M1BO3U|5|Really like and the price is right.  Like small size and closed brush to base design because easy to keep clean
B003COAFPQ|5|Shocked it WORKS
B008YDXM28|2|I love coconut scents but this smells a little too synthetic. Not very appealing, in my opinion.
B003FSGRW4|5|Since my senior year of college I have been searching for a product that could actually clear up old acne scars. Unfortunately, most products these days focus solely on age prevention. When I finally had some money to try the more expensive products, I immediately thought of Clinique. Even as far back as high school, Clinique has always been known for its effectiveness against acne and the damage that it leaves behind. When I purchased this product it came with a sample of the face lotion of the same name. Applying both products, twice daily to my face, I saw a marked reduction in the visibility of my acne scars after only four days of use. By the end of two weeks, the same scars that had haunted me for seventeen years, were completely gone. What people seem to forget is that the composition of a face is unique to each individual and the same product will not work for some as it does others. That doesn't mean that the product isn't effective. If a person's skin tone doesn't become more even with this product, the most probable cause is genetics. I have used a ton of different products over the years to get rid of these acne scars and none of them worked. Instead of buying it online, I actually went to the Clinique counter in a department store. The only reason I was willing to spend the extra money to try this product is their guarantee that I could return it for a full refund if it didn't work or if I was allergic to it, a problem I have had with many other products. Most online stores will not give the same guarantee, thus if you are not sure about a beauty product, it would be best to buy it from a brick and mortar store. That way, if it doesn't work, you are no worse off and can use the refund money to try something else.
B00PR1BXRQ|5|It's the best product I have ever use to my face,with in 3 days I saw big difference on my face,such as glowness, brightness ,softness,I look 5 years younger,I just love this product,I will recomond for my family and friends ,For sure I will buy it again.<br />Thank you much....
B00SKWG0OK|5|I love this ring so much!!! Super cute, lightweight for a dangling ring, and it is super good quality! I have worn it everyday ever since I got it back in June. Definitely recommend this ring!
B002GEJVVC|5|I love this stuff. Love.  It's a staple. I need it to tame a mop of fine hair that has a life and mind of its own.  It had become abundantly clear to me over the years that I was merely a host, without so much as the modest favour of a symbiotic relationship.  After years of suffering in silence (with the perhaps notable exception of whining to friends), I discovered this stuff.  Game on. I use about a quarter size of this nectar (along with one pump of Pureology Essential Repair in the green bottle - also reviewed...but you know what I'm gonna say - I love that too), on towel-dried clean hair.  After blow drying and flat ironing, my hair is soft, non frizzy and agreeable and stays that way unless there's an extreme gale or Nor'easter in which case, what can you do? Certainly your foul weather gear comes with a hoodie.
B0002Z8IV6|5|This product works very well.  There was no brassiness when I went from brown to blonde, and I was able to do the die job myself without going to the salon.
B0076KAM7S|5|I LOVE this blush SO much. I wear it everyday and I've had it for a month now, and I still have barely messed with the pattern, so you definitely get a lot on here. It's very pigmented, so the color is definitely buildable. The consistency is nice and light and soft, and the color (I got Natural) is very natural looking, but it's still a true pink, in my opinion, and well suited to those with cool/blue/pink undertones...I think. Basically, it looks nice on my very, very pale skin and NOT fake or overdone.<br /><br />I would highly, highly recommend this blush, and it's SO cheap on here, you really have nothing to lose! (Plus, Physician's Formula is supposed to be healthier and all that.)
B003UZTF9E|5|Cleaned my teeth and now I receive more kisses from the wife.
B004VFTNK8|4|It does not completely straighten my hair but it does reduce the curls and friiness
B007BOG8BI|5|This is really a great product that moisturizers and keeps your skin glowing<br />which gives you a very dewy and fresh appearance.
B00MNMQKPC|5|These brushes were super cheap and on top of that these brushes did just as good as a job as my Sigma and MAC brushes! They came in great packaging, no weird smell like one review said. And they came within my 2 day prime shipping. Definitely have to try these brushes.
B00AK5BMRA|1|Careful!!!Product was two months away from being expired when it arrived. Very disappointing! For a little more money, I could have bought the same (AND newer) product from my dentist!
B004VN31JO|5|I absolutely love this nail polish rack. It is an awesome way to store nail polish. Now I know exactly what colors I own. The item was exactly as described! No complaints :)
B000UJZIEY|2|I liked the idea of lotion and being able to use it in the shower - and the stripped-down scifi looks were interesting.  But when it's judged on the basic function of a razor it's less than average, it simply doesn't give a close shave, and the unusual design means that the few clippings it does make aren't captured.    I've had it too long now to return, so it's going to be used for a light trim rather than being my main razor.
B004SO2SVI|4|The pheromone oil in my opinion, was a fairly good product. Very pleasant added boost of confidence, had the price been more reasonable, I wouldve rated this product higher..
B00FZ1CGME|4|Having tried many other products without much success, my doctor recommended using topical Vitamin C.  After using one bottle, I am happy to report my Rosacea has improved remarkably.  I think it's worth a try for those who are seeking skin irritation relief.
B00178RONK|5|I used it once since I purchased it. So far it's been super good. I've always like the vaporizer in the spa treatments so being to be able to do it at home is really nice.
B0058SY1X6|5|I've been using this for years and I love it, both the clippers have not broken down and its been years. Cleans well and is easy to use.
B000PW7K38|4|Chemotherapy really does a number on your nails. My chemo was finished and several weeks later my nails started to shred. It was driving me nuts. I don't even care what they look like, but having them tearing and catching on everything was painful and annoying. The Rejuvacote was just the ticket. They looked better immediately with the product applied and they have stopped tearing. I am very pleased.<br /><br />Note: I have noticed some reviewers complain about pain. I had NO pain whatsoever. If you do have pain, you have a sensitivity to an ingredient in this product and should not use it. The pain is not something to &#34;push through&#34;
B00GIQOUTM|5|The scent is amazing! My boyfriend loves it too!
B004FAJFDO|5|love love love the colors are just as bright as shown they stay that bright when applied and the best part is it was only 10 bucks for all these colors
B00EA6FIHA|3|it's just like buying an eyeliner.
B00DUF76L8|5|Love this color!!  Have brown eyes and layer this with another liner. Just a fun look to try. I did and having fun with it!!
B003ZI01S0|5|This foundation is the best makeup I have ever used hands down.  When I smooth it over my blotchy red and brown age spotted face it is like waving a magic wand.  It blends perfectly & looks so natural that I actually get compliments on my skin.  It does not highlight wrinkles, it stays on ALL day & I can't &#34;feel&#34; it on my face.  It is also a physical sunblock which has actually reversed some of the brown spots & freckles on my face.  I have recommended it to so many friends and they all love it like I do regardless of age, skin type or skin color.
B002HWS9GQ|5|Works great, does exactly what it is suppose to, really like the way the toothbrush will temporarily stop when you are causing too much pressure on your teeth.
B00IA3EJJW|5|I love this wrap! I love how there is an elastic band that attaches to the back of the towel to keep it in place and the wrap is easily washed with my other towels. I bought each teacher a wrap for the holiday season and they love them! Use mine every day!
B00JJQ6YVK|4|Never used a cleansing conditioner before, and I enjoy it. Makes my hair soft and manageable, and I have some very think curly hair. Although I do not use for every wash, I feel as if there is too much build up, so I use regular shampoo in between (every 3-4 washes) then use the cleansing conditioner as a replacement to conditioner, and back to just cleansing again.
B000B9T17I|4|We have used another Mop shampoo....I find this works much better for me.  I have oilier hair than others in the household.
B008PWBRCU|4|Style not exactly as pictured. Needs some tapering to look as pictured. Hair is nice, doesn't shed nor do tracks dislocate or come apart. I would recommend this style
B00KP5TS4Y|1|its just not what I expected, don't get me wrong, it is really good high quality and sterile tools.
B000PWK6D4|1|I was so afraid to try this after so many bad reviews.  You must blow dry the hair after applying the straightener, then apply the nuetralizer. I initially liked the texture but then it just turned all frizzy and worse than my hair would even be without any straightener.  I have used Ogilvi3  for like forever and know it can be hard on your hair, and hope this would be a good alternative.  Remember all straighteners are hard on your hair, but I don't care to be even more frizzer than I was before!
B00LPV1GPG|5|Only used it twice but works well if you ask me But I'm not a professional.
B00354XMH6|2|Small comb, I'm new to growing my beard long. I should have read the detail better, this is a super small comb for mustache only.
B00D8ZOVIQ|5|I am very pleased with this diffuser.  It runs quietly and I plan to purchase more for other rooms in my home and for work.
B004HAH9Y4|5|This stuff is the best.  It took me about 3 weeks to get my skin really evened out, but once it was, this stuff was a dream come true.
B008KMS1BA|4|This soap is non-irritating on my sensitive skin.  It has a lovely fruity scent that makes the bathroom smell nice, but doesn't linger on my skin and it lathers well.  It removes makeup easily, but it doesn't dry out my face. Seems to be a long lasting bar.
B00067YSLO|5|perfect the eqRemington Wet 2 Straight 2 &#34;Wide Placa Wet / Dry cerámica que endereza el pelo ...<br />uipment works well I have not had any problems,perfectly heated much love,I recommend it one hundred percent
B002TH8AEA|5|At the risk of sounding like an infomercial with this overly excited and peppy review, I really really like this wig.  I was expecting it to be decent quality, but when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that it was the quality that I would expect for a more expensive wig.  The wig that I received is a slightly different style from the photo, so if you want the wig to look exactly like the picture, it may require a little bit of additional styling/teasing, but the difference is not worth complaining about and is easily rectified.  The wig has a nice fit, a natural look, and some really nice coloring (it has some subtle highlights and lowlights that make it look more natural, as opposed to a wig that's one solid color).  I'm naturally a dark brunette but this wig worked well for me, even with my dark eyebrows.  It's also a good style for a round face.  I would recommend this wig to pretty much anyone who's looking for a good quality wig for a price that won't break your wallet, especially for use in any theatre productions (it looks great from the stage).
B00444WFW4|4|Love the flat iron, my first time using the Babyliss Pro! I still haven't figured out how to use the curling iron, but it actually straightens my hair pretty well too! I have 4a type hair and it works really well on my hair and I don't even use the highest heat setting either!
B000NJE5JK|3|Inexpensive. Thin but fluffs up after washing. For the price, very nice.
B002N0MZLM|5|Fine quality and great packaging.
B00MOL4AIQ|5|These were great!! They filled the bathroom with relaxing scents, didn't color the tub and the oils left my skin soft so I didn't need lotion. Highly recommend 😀
B00U68N9AO|5|Wow! Such a great value and such a great curler! I am a professional make-up artist where my work is displayed on Television screens and Theater screens and I only want the best for my high profile clients. Highly suggest you purchase!
B004DN8F4S|3|I read all the reviews and selected this mirror as the best I could find for my needs. The design of the mirror is great but the execution is flawed. As mentioned in many other posts, the mirror does not stay on the non-magnified side. Luckily, I mostly use the magnified side because my eyesight is not very good anymore. If I want to use the regular mirror side, I have to find the sweet spot that keeps it in place which is often frustrating.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the switch for the lights. Its a push on/off switch but it never stays on. I have improvised by keeping a small barbell next to it. When I need to turn on the light, I set the barbell on the switch and it keeps the lights on. I should probably return it, but its not worth the hassle. It meets my needs at this time.<br /><br />Too bad Ott-Lite can't seem to get it right.
B005OZF1S2|5|I'm in love with this brush... Great for blending and your brow area!
B001BAROMK|4|This is an OK product.  I am forever searching for the product that will give me luxurious volume.  I think John Frieda products are good and I will always give a new one a try.  But, did it work, not really, not for me anyway.  I hope this doesn't discourage people from giving this product a try.  I do have problem hair, thinning and baby fine and have found few products that can help me.
B00456E93E|5|My girlfriend loved it and is still using it to this day. Boyfriend that doesn't know what to get his girl go with this!
B000VTRJMM|5|omg i love this product i didnt really believe what people were saying about this product because people tend to exaggerate alot when talking about things they like but i decided to try it anyway.i brought the chi keratin mist first and it smelled kinda strong compared to this product but i really did like it, until i tried this product it was great and it didnt smell as strong as the keratin mist and as soon as i put it in my hair and combed it, it just glided through wow, and im a little past my perm date and my new growth is there but this product got my hair in shape all i needed to do was blowdry (i only had to blowdry with the keratin mist to) and my hair was straight now i wish i had brought a bigger bottle    ps. did you know they tried to sell this product in my local bbs for $24.00 and i paid $6.00 and some change for it online puhleeease!!!
B00385WMJ6|5|I love the quality and design on this cap! Worth it!
B00HUDLA3Q|5|Works great on my face to shrink pores and brings a healthy glow to my skin. I have used weekly and each package has the right amount in it. I am over fifty and my daughter in her 20's uses it also!
B00LU1V3JK|2|did not see any difference since I have been using it.. does nothing like it said..Not satisfied at all!
B008P0L650|3|Work's really good
B006L1DNWY|5|this is a great seller. Item as described. great deal. i bought a few of these for stocking stuffers and they were perfect. thank you.
B0045OR410|4|I love it!! Doesn't strip my hair of it natural oils and it leaves my hair so curly and hydrated..
B001NCAHYS|4|this reduces age spots within a week. is silky soft, and reduces lines and wrinkles in a wk. great product, great price. people buy anti aging stuff for face why not body too. - will use again.! im definetly a customer!
B0002RUOJI|5|This shampoo is an exact replacement for the discontinued, Simply Silver, which I've used for many years. I would highly recommend it!
B00517W45G|5|I like the flexible heads and the optional locking feature.  It also &#34;pulverizes&#34; whiskers much better than my old Braun, making it easier to clean.  The trimmer takes a little getting used to, but overall I'm pleased with the shaver.
B004FQGLQC|2|I have used dry shampoo for years. I prefer Batiste, but they havn't really mastered a scent that's appealing. So, I decided to buy a can of this. The good news is it smells nice, the bad news is it's a horrible dry shampoo. It takes so much more spray to do the same job as just a few spritzes of Batiste or another dry shampoo. Even worse, the residue it leaves is really gritty and evident in your hair. Everytime I touch my scalp, I can feel it like fine sand :/ It was such a waste of money but I'm not a waster so I just use it when I won't be out much.
B005FAPIKM|5|Really like this shampoo and conditioner. I live in high humidity. I wash my hair a lot<br />My hair looks healthy and shiny.
B002ZG96HA|4|This is just what I was looking for in a 10X mirror.  Excellent price, good quality mirror without waving.  The stand is plastic but I had expected that.  Would buy again in a minute.
B0066SKVQI|4|I'll wear it on my toes because I like it, but it's too hard to get off my fingernails.
B00DUWZWGC|5|Arrived on time and was exactly as pictured. Just what I was looking for.
B0006NXQF2|5|Timely shipping and Works great! Thank you
B000G1EQ1W|5|When I purchased this razor in January, I read with some concern the reviews that consistently complained about the cleaning solution and its longevity.  I read how Braun was screwing owners over, that the solution lasted less than three weeks, how expensive it was, yadayadayada.      So here we are, the end of August, eight months later.  I JUST replaced my 3rd cleaning fluid replacement.  That's THREE in eight months, folks - with a cleaning EVERY day.  Lessee...at $5/replacement...wow..yeah, that's hitting the ol' wallet.    Whatever.  The bottom line is that I don't have to manually clean my razor, and to me, that's a HUGE time saver.    That said, Braun's statement that \\"you should replace your cutter and screen every eighteen months\\" is total BS.  After six months, the cutter wasn't cutting, it was pulling.  Still, that's three months longer than my Remington cutters lasted, so I can't complain.    Bottom line, this is a GREAT razor at a great price.  Don't listen to the cheapskates who probably can't afford to buy this anyways, so they find a reason to whine about it.
B003HVCUAC|5|I loved the way my hair turned out after using this product! My curls were amazing, soft and manageable. I loved it.
B000NCMMBA|5|Great blades and they shave great.
B005DRXW9G|4|It's just okay.. I will not repurchase. Addendum: I have been using this more consistently and I like it very much.
B00E4PMQAO|2|it works good and doesn't pinch but it broke some reason it has a weak spot on it cheap plastic
B00008DQJP|5|.<BR>This factory re-conditioned shaver is like brand new and comes with a two year manufacturers warranty.<br />The price I paid for this shaver is incredible! ... Thank you Amazon.com<br />First shave took less than 3 minutes and it felt like I used a straight razor .. Extremely soft and smooth .. with no nicks<BR>or tiny scratches.  I do not even need to use an electric razor pre-shave lotion or gel on my face. <br />With a full charge of the internal battery, this shaver will easily give me two weeks of daily use.<br />The shaver is easy to use, gives you a very close shave. The pop up hair trimmer easily takes care of long hair.<br />The Braun 7505 will last a long time if you methodically keep it clean, recharge the internal battery and replace the foil/cutter block after 18 months of daily use.<br />This one is definitely a 'Keeper' and I highly recommend the Factory Reconditioned Braun 7505 Syncro Shaver to anyone who is looking for an outstanding men's electric shaver.
B005DJ25Z6|5|First, I'm updating this review from the original one (you can see the original below).  I'm doing this because after posting the 1st review, I was contacted by the company and they very kindly and respectfully asked if they could replace the first pair as they believed they were defective.<br /><br />Second, I believe they were correct!  They sent me a replacement pair and I can accurately report that they did not tear when putting them on.  (And I gave them a good tug to test them out)  Also, I wore them for several nights and have washed them and they've held up great!  So, my rating has changed to 5 stars!!!  They've been great at keeping the moisture in (as I had hoped for) overnight while wearing them and fit snug, but not too tight, which is good as many are a bit large and fall off during the night.<br /><br />Only thing to note is that if you have VERY large hands, these are probably not for you.  Mine are medium-large and they are snug on me -- but they stay on which had been a problem with other gloves!!<br /><br />GREAT PRODUCT!<br /><br />(Original Review below)<br /><br />I bought this pair of gloves at the same time as another I ordered (see my review of them here:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Earth-Therapeutics-1-pair/product-reviews/B000JF8XEQ/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1  ).<br />While I have larger woman's hands, these gloves seemed a little snug on my hands/fingers, yet they fingers are way long (and I don't have a short hand either).  It isn't a major problem, but if your hands are very large and or you have very short fingers, this may not be the product for you.<br /><br />Also, the first time I pulled them on, I was pulling kind of hard (probably since they're so snug) and the outside seam ripped a few stitches.  Not a big deal as I can stitch it back together, but it was a bit disappointing on top of the fit.  I wouldn't order this pair again, but would order the other ones mentioned above -- and they were about the same price.rice.
B00UM1X6YE|5|Great product
B0080M092E|3|I really wanted to like this product, especially because I saw that Song Ji Hyo uses this cleanser/endorses Banila Co. However, it broke me out consistently whenever I used it. I thought maybe it was other factors so I stopped using it for a while, stopped breaking out, then used it again and broke out again so I had to toss it. But, I will say that it does a very good job of removing all your makeup and has a very pleasant smell to it. Obviously will not purchase again.<br /><br />PRODUCT/APPLICATION:<br />Comes with a spatula (I didn't use it because I prefer to use my skincare products with clean hands). Has a very light, sherbet smell that kindof makes you keep wanting to use/smell it. Product is kindof chunky when you scoop it out at first, but then it melts as soon as you rub your fingers together, which always fascinated me. Easy application, easy to remove. Does not sting your eyes either.
B000YB3OQ2|5|this is a strong comb like the other reviews says it does not Poke your head and you can tell and feel that it will last very long.
B00RGQ36AM|5|I love this hair the texture the body it's great , plus the shipment arrived before estimated date
B0024097TE|2|I was looking for a mild fragrance.  This one's is overpowering; not how I imagined &#34;lotus&#34; fragrance.  Also the sticks are not of small uniform thickness.
B003DZXC36|3|Once I let them know my problem , after a quite nasty text, they resolved my problem to my satisfaction
B009A3RDLM|2|This item is very fragile. Can break easily.
B00264NW7G|5|I have heard about this brush for years but have never tried it before. My five year old daughter does not like detangling time. I wouldn't say this one was NO TEARS, but it was definitely easier and gentler than any comb or brush we've tried before. No pulling, and left her hair very soft, even the knotty section in the back.
B003II53Z8|5|I have used this sunscreen on my 3-year old son since he was less than a year old, and I can't imagine using anything else. Yes, it does make him look a bit mime-like, but he has always been well protected (even while splashing in the ocean), and does not fuss when I put Badger on as it doesn't smell or feel \\"yucky\\" to him. I have used both the lightly scented and this one (the unscented) and prefer the unscented. I appreciate that it does not have added scent, but also find that it spreads more easily that the scented version (though I can't imagine why that is). And yes, my husband and I do use Badger as well, though admittedly we prefer hats to protect our faces since Badger is a bit clown-like for vain adults!
B00CMTRE9C|5|Totally works!
B0027WPJRI|5|I have gotten this directly from DHC before.  This stuff is the greatest for under your make up.
B00KPF3B7O|5|These extensions are so beautiful and very affordable. They match my hair perfectly! I just ordered two more sets!
B00I9K3C12|5|Very good
B000YB60HM|5|My wife was extremely pleased with the scent.
B004NMYSTU|5|Thank you
B00OBRKM24|5|Great product.<br />The wife and I love it
B009LY2GC6|5|I Love my nail art manicure fimo canes sticks and rod gel tips. There so awesome to wear on fingernails and your toenails very easy to cut them i love to cut them thin . I receveid my order very early . I Do Thank You so much .
B0006NYQNI|5|Best product for older skin. Use Day cream during the day with Night cream under eyes.  Visible difference right away.
B0054Y3I24|5|This absolutely works. My hair stylist used it on me once and I told her I just had to have some. I sprinkle some on my crown roots, tease and away I go. It holds very tightly and even the next morning my hair still looks decent. 5stars!
B009D9O87K|4|Works well!
B00H28JKO0|5|I have been a face lotion user since back in the teenage days of using Proactiv. Fast forward a lot of years and in the last year or two my sun spots/freckles stopped going away in the winter.<br /><br />Until this product.<br /><br />I use this after the shower, one thin coat per day, and in a month it helped my skin repair and get rid of my sun spots. It wasn't an overnight thing, so you have to be patient.<br /><br />I don't really have any wrinkles to speak of, but from the perspective of making the skin look younger and free of spots, it definitely did that! Fully recommend!<br /><br />By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing. I occasionally get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who appreciate my way of reviewing and ask if I'll consider reviewing a product for them, with no obligation or cost. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.
B00KYZA8DA|5|The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The mouth guard is nice. A little bit too thick to wear and keep my mouth shut comfortably during the night. It is impossible to thin it yourself.
B003CGN8SA|5|I've Order this Bio~oil to use on my Scar,Just received a New Kidney!!!
B00NBAKXIA|5|I love how smooth this feels when applied to eye area, so far I'm pleased with my purchase...I'm tired of my raccoon eyes! Will continue to use for sure!
B00133HK3I|1|Had good expectations for this.  After all, how can you go wrong with a simple brow brush, right?  Looked good and sturdy too. Well, after only about one month of use (and that means only about a total of 6 strokes a day in the morning on my brows), I was shocked to find that the bristles were falling off.  I got this to replace a brow brush whose bristles were falling off, but only after about 20 years of use!  Unbelievable!
B00JQYJH3C|4|Love the fact that this sunscreen has a bronze color when you apply it instead of the ghostly pale color of others. It can bead up however, if you work it in too much
B002HWS7RM|5|Exactly what I needed. Good price
B001MP0T2Q|1|Too hard to use...didn't like it and already stopped using it.  Don't waste your money on it...walmart had them cheaper if you really want one.
B00XQMIMCM|5|Absolutely the best hair serum that I have ever used and I have used several products. I love the scent as well; it is so refreshing and the scent stays with your hair for a while. I love smelling my hair.  This serum has 12-Exotic Oils and as soon as your put it in your hand you feel the silkiness right away. You do not have to use much and I have long thick hair and just used about the size of a nickel in the palm of my hand and rubbed my hands together and ran my hands through my hair. I then used a little tiny bit more and used that on the ends of my hair.  I have wavy hair and I used my straightener and my hair looked so good.  No frizzy strands and my hair is silky and shiny. I received this product at a discounted price during a promotional period for testing in exchange for an honest review.  This product is salon quality and this price is less than what you would pay at a salon for this quality product. This is my opinion and coming from a person that tries hair products out all of the time and this is an amazing serum that will last a long time because it only takes a little to have your hair looking fabulous.  This girl is excited!
B0009XH6TG|5|have been using now for 2 weeks. good quality, blows plenty  of hot air. the cord winds well into the dryer
B004RK7I2W|5|REAAAALLLY GOOD !! im a 17 year old girl and I was doubting this product but I put it on and went in my pool went swimming for a while and It was still perrrfect! GO KOREA !
B0009MFUPO|5|Shaving is so much better when you have clean, sharp blades.  These are about $5 cheaper than the same product at Wal-Mart.
B000NCMMBA|5|My husband loves these. Close shave and much cheaper than disposable razors. Less waste too.
B00GA9PCJY|5|Stocking stuffer for my daughter.
B008V9JG02|5|Material is good
B004SVM9TW|5|Have only had a couple of ingrowns in the last few months and this little roller lasts a long time!
B0095IMNI0|5|This works it even has 30 second interval timer for tooth brush . Love it!
B002HTI2TI|4|works great
B0074BZP80|5|My hair is very dry and more wavy than curly so I was worried this shampoo would be too heavy but I was wrong. It's prefect, it has just enough lather to feel like your hair is clean but without leaving it dry and brittle.
B00R18D3VM|5|Product as descibed. Works and fits perfect
B00016XJ4M|5|as pet groomer, I always come home to use this stuff! It cleans so well, I LOVE IT!! Hands down the best without drying your face.
B003CP12O8|5|I was given the opportunity to try this product for free from Bzzagent and Crest. This has become a part of my daily dental hygiene and am happy with the results. I have fresher breath, cleaner feeling teeth, and the health benefits of using an alcohol free mouthwash. I didn't experience any burning in my mouth and thought this tasted great.
B000IHC6G6|4|My skin looked HORRIBLE after I got pregnant. It would be super greasy and dry & flaky all at the same time. I also started breaking out like a teenager again. Oh, the joys of hormone changes! Anyways, this stuff smelled a little funny to me the first time I used it. I'm used to it now, and it's actually not so bad. It helps TREMENDOUSLY, however, I can't use it every day. It really exfoliates well, which is why I can't use it daily or twice a day like the directions state. It started to make my face feel very sensitive. So, I just use a face wash gel/soap from Simple which seems to be ok on my days I don't need exfoliating. If my skins starts to look rough with pimples/blackheads and dead skin, I use this, and I look nice and glowy again. I would definitely purchase this product again.
B000WSF41A|5|At first seeing the jar of this i thought something was wrong, maybe a color switch up, because the label was much darker than another tub of flamingo pink that i had ordered before. When i used the color i saw that there was no mix up jus something different about the color of the label. The dye was a vibrant but deep pink, eventually fades into a brighter pink with more washes. Also it smells really good too it has a grape or berry scent.
B00OYVZ6UA|5|Awesome sale! Smells delish and keeps dandruff at bay!
B00GZHBS4O|5|Product as advertised. On time delivery
B00D9NV2D4|4|Doesn't smell very good but my skin is looking much better. Hopefully with time it will treat my stretch marks and acne scars.
B001E11LMU|5|My husband got &#34;addicted&#34; to this soap when a friend who worked at a whole food warehouse gave him a bar.  We can find it at our local co-op, but even with shipping....this multipack is much cheaper.  So I can keep him in his favorite soap much cheaper.
B00005MA7R|5|I bought my GMT200t beard trimmer almost 9 years ago and it's still working well. I use it once a week and sometime's have used it twice a week. I think you just have to treat it just like you would your car, don't abuse it and keep your teeth oiled and cleaned and it will last forever. I've gotten good use out of mine and will buy another one when that time comes!
B001VH6F9G|5|The replacement foil and cutting head make my 10 year old razor cut like new. The only difference from a new razor is that I have to recharge the battery more often than when new, but still only every 1-2 weeks.
B00OXC8ND2|4|I just bought this brush for $8.79 for blending foundation.  It feels hard but when i washed the sponge brush became soft. It works well under eyes,cheeks and around nose. It absorbs well and evenly blends your product. When i use liquid foundation or pancake foundation,either way it blends well. I like this new style sponge on a brush but I still prefer my synthetic foundation brush. I am not convinced on the durability of the sponge lasting long. I was just trying out something new to see if this thing really works.
B00CLILRMY|5|Works really well.
B00TKIW3R6|5|I really like this bowl!  There are a couple of good design feature in this bowl that aren't fully detailed in the seller's description (at this writing).<br /><br />The &#34;swirl&#34; pattern at the bottom has texture to it, and this helps build lather.  The sides of the bowl have a half dozen shallow indents; these also help build lather.  The bowl is nice and thick, which means more mass, which in turn means better heat retention and warmer lather.  I can build a nice lather pretty quickly and easily in this bowl.<br /><br />I've only had this bowl a few days, and I'm already thinking about planting a bonsai tree in my first bowl, which has a perfectly smooth and uniform interior (that doesn't do much to help build lather).
B00V6JMUVG|5|liked the easiness to apllying to eyelid, very smooth application.
B00016RIIA|5|Awesome brush!  It did smell funny when you first get it. I ran hot water over it for a bit and added soap and rinsed three times.<br />Brush now smells like soap
B001EO5WYU|5|I was a little concerned when I ordered Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo from Amazon based on another person's experience of getting a knock off version.  But I've compared my Amazon Nexxus to the same product from CVS and it's the same color, smell and it doesn't take my color out.  IMHO the true test of a color safe shampoo is on red hair dye and Nexxus makes the cut.  I don't often take the trouble to review products because I don't feel I'm that educated a consumer.  In this area, however, I have had years of experience trying to keep auburn on my naturally white hair (yeah, I know it's a losing battle) and Nexxus is the best.  Better than what my salon uses and better than Matrix.
B000BTO6CI|5|This scent is my favorite.  JM has a soft floral, clean scent that makes you feel like you just got out of the shower.  I love it!
B0099SBI2S|3|color is too dark to me
B005PX7CS0|4|Love it. It is feels natural. And give u a heathly glow so happy love it or winter and summer
B000980PGM|5|This exfoliant is amazing.  You will notice a difference the first time and EVERY time you use it.  I use this on clients with sensitive skin (including myself); I have never had a client react to this product negatively.  Great for all skin types. LOVE IT!<br />JA Licensed in FL<br />[[ASIN:B000980PGM Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, 2.6-Ounce]]
B0009UAS8U|5|QUICKIE.   Since I've gotten this I literally cannot stop using it.     Perfect for a quick touch up (hence the name) and very pigmented so a small amount goes a long way.     I have a pale pinkish complexion and a small amount of quickie looks wonderful on my skin.     I have never used a powder blush before (always a cheek stain) but this won me over. So I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a first time powder blush.     Very compact case too so no blush everywhere, and a handy little mirror.
B00J1PXZJ8|1|No difference in my cellulite . I used this brush 2-3 times a day for 3 weeks..... No results. Don't waste your money.
B004Y9LNEK|4|I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND MY FAVORITE...LIPSTICK!!!<br />AND AS A BONUS I RECIEVED IT TWO DAYS EARLIER THAN I HAD EXPECTED.<br />MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THAT OF THE ENVELOPE HAD BEEN OPENED, BUT THE LIPSTICK WAS STILL SEALED.<br />I AM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER. THANK-YOU.
B00CMRZ9N2|5|On of the best serums I've used. I will be repurchasing this product for as long as it will be around. It's great for my problematic, hormonal, skin which is oily, but also gets dehydrated from the weather.
B007JT7AGC|5|This stuff is great. It's the only thing that keeps my husband's dandruff in check. It also makes his hair especially soft and smooth
B00FFH79FC|5|Great buy and really enjoy it. Got lot compliments for the ladies. I WILL REODER WHEN I NEED TO !
B004SGKMA0|5|Consistent shave and affordable.
B00N5A6VZ0|5|Pleasantly surprised when receiving this 9-pc makeup brush set.  The packaging definitely says quality, the design is elegant.  The brushes are not as soft as I want, but over all I love this set.  Definitely one of the best gift sets a lady would want!
B006B6SE6E|5|I love this for my hair. I put a small amount on my hair wet and now its smooth and shiny. Looks and feels so good.
B001DNE3KQ|5|Has a great shave for the money. Batterie life is good around 10 between charges.
B000NRAUPK|5|This is so thick and creamy! I don't feel like I am combing through dry hair after using this !
B003TUYLAS|5|Really nice product!
B003TP9KTA|5|Works
B00GDB3KLQ|5|Fresh Cream is a soft fragrance .  It is good for layering over other Philosophy products.  Strong perfumes give me an instant headache, this one does not.  Spritz any time of day or night for a soft scent. This would be great for a young girl too.  In fact I sent a bottle to my grand-daughter, she loves it.
B002B9DWBC|5|I did some research and chose this as my first bb cream to try.  I LOVE it.  I have combination skin, prone to breakouts from stress and since I started using this five days ago I've completely cleared up and I can see my complexion starting to get noticeably better!  covers better than any foundation (including specific blemish covers) I've ever tried and really LASTS.  I bartend weddings and work up quite a sweat initially setting up my bar/hauling booze and this stayed on through pouring sweat and rain!  couldn't recommend it more to someone looking for great coverage, blemish treatment, spf and long-wear!  this shade is a little light, the light beige is more like a porcelain skin tone.  I'm italian and tend to tan pretty dark in summer, I'm planning on getting natural beige to match my skin a bit better but the light beige with a little bronzer on top works just fine.
B004Y9GYZS|5|Leaves lips smooth and has a wonderful flavor.
B000G686M2|3|The mirror met my expectations.  I give it a passing review, but be careful to clean the surface and wet the suction cups when hanging it.  It sticks to tile or another mirror very well if you do that.  If not...  ...it will take an unwelcome fall.
B001MS7P1Q|4|This costs a little more than comparable products from other brands.  While I do feel that eos products are good, I also feel like a little bit of the cost is simply paying extra for fancy packaging.  So keep that in mind if economy is your main goal.<br /><br />That being said, I felt like this was a decent shave cream.  It was non-irritating and I got a good, close shave.  I don't know that there's anything about the scent that says &#34;lavender jasmine&#34; to me, but I did find this to have a pleasant, floral scent.<br /><br />This did not foam as some shave gels and creams do.  However, I felt that it provided good coverage (not always visible, but I could feel it if I ran my hand over my leg).<br /><br />Here are the ingredients, since they're not currently listed on the product page:<br /><br />Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Stearyl Alcohol, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Petrolatum, Laureth 23, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Gluconolactone, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Oat Kernel Extract, Shea Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Carbomer, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730), Blue 1 (CI 42090), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Limonene, Linalool<br /><br />Unlike with some other eos products, this does not have completely natural ingredients (am a little disappointed to see artificial dyes, for example).  However, the ingredients are similar to those in other products of this general type.<br /><br />In the end, this is a decent shave gel but there is nothing that really stands out about it.  If you like the scent, this will probably be a good choice for you (can always smell it in a store before ordering, just to see).  3.5 stars.
B0026IBSVE|5|Excellent kit, has everything you need. I bough these to make the transition to cutting my own hair and I'm very satisfied.
B000H89GN2|1|These are so thin, they simply crumple up as soon as you wear the shoe one time.  I would never buy them again.
B00028QF9U|4|Sure, a crystal? My first thought was 'These guys haven't smelled ME!'<br /><br />A few years ago a friend of mine owned a health food store and recommended an early version of this product. It basically was, well, a smooth 'rock' vs. a nice twisty applicator. Stubbornly, I refused.<br /><br />Not to be overly personal, but as I was dieting I noticed my stink factor was rising. In fact - and I can't verify this - it seemed the more fragrance-y coverup products I used, the stronger my 'stank' got. THIS is not an attractive trend.<br /><br />First day with Crystal Body Deodorant and my foulness had met its match. Half a star off for a little to much 'play' in the applicator. I made a little cardboard shim to settle it down and it worked great. Lasted a lot longer than I had ever expected, too.<br /><br />People's chemistries differ, so your mileage may vary but I'm happily on my second stick!<br /><br />Update:<br />I'm ready to call this the best value in my medicine cabinet. I just purchased my third since my initial review and I shower twice a day and use this product each time. When I think about how much money I used to spend on some pricey P&G product often, I cringe. This continues to work like a charm as I'm out hustling in my job during the summer heat.<br /><br />Bravo!
B000XEB3UO|5|I was a skeptic and thought this wouldn't be as strong as the Kenneth Cole reaction that you buy in a store but I took it to a shop in the mall and two managers said the smell was identical to their tester in their shop.  It was a great price and got to be in just a few days.  Only thing there was no box, the bottle was just wrapped in tissue paper but that's okay who needs a box anyways!
B00DSZ1QYI|5|This is the same stuff my wife spent a small fortune purchasing at her hair-dresser.  I won't have to worry about the growing collection of &#34;almost empty&#34; small bottles in our bathroom.  Now my wife refill the old bottles and stores the big one.
B0075J4TDI|5|This stuff is seriously the best exfoliating body scrub! It feels so good, and it's even gotten rid of my body acne too! It lasts a long time and smells great!
B000YJ2SLG|4|OK, so I love this lotion for my face, makes it look so moisturized and clean looking, but for my arms and legs, I prefer Aveeno, Aveeno makes my arms and legs nice, sleek and gives them a very nice moisturized look, with Cerave they don't look moisturized at all, just looks like a weird film on my body.
B00K58NEIM|2|not worth it
B0016K8B2M|5|Excellent!
B001MIZMP2|5|This is my favorite body wash by far! I personally use it just as body wash. I have never tried it as shampoo or as a shaving cream.
B00HN1FMFC|5|These are great nails.
B004B4HQIK|2|I used this product as a primer, before applying a leave in product, so I can detangle my hair easier for styling. Then, I blow dry my hair with a round brush, section by section (I now coloring my hair with a dark color and use a mask before using the hairdryer). The issue is that my I bleached my hair 6 months ago and totally damaged my hair even though I did in a salon with a good reputation in town. Now, I’ve been trying to moisture my hair weekly and wait for my hair to grow because my hair is extremely porous and there is no product to fix this (just moisturizing). This whole story is to say that this product may not work in my hair because it is already very damaged and the ingredients may be too abrasive (even though natural) to the state of my hair. I believe it was a bad choice for the the type of my hair right now.
B000ZV0D9W|5|was super awesome for the plates that have the designees !
B005LD5EHA|5|Perfect - like MK
B007B469MG|4|I wash my hands constantly throughout the day. So extra protection from dryness is a must, this was a great cream for me. No greasy feeling, leaves skin smooth, and soft. The price wasn't bad. I usualy use either Aquaphore or Neutragena hand creams and  both are more expensive and work about the same. It's been years since I purchased Avon productrs, I did't know they were still in businness!Well, I'm very pleased they are!
B0027VCNGO|5|great product and an even better price
B003WR3QSG|5|I got a boars hair brush but the badger hair brush works a whole lot better.
B001GQ3GEY|1|I wanted to love this little guy - it had all the makings of an awesome product at an amazing price!<br /><br />I can't recommend this product to people, thus I've chosen 1 star as a rating - I don't hate it, but it needs improvements in order to make it a useful product.<br /><br />I have had this trimmer for a month and it is an acceptable value for the money; however I'm going to return it because it causes more frustration that it is worth.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The plastic guides to put over the wide beard trimming blade are cheaply made. I've bent a few of the 'tines' and it is getting difficult to run through my fairly thick haired beard.<br />2. The blades are rusty - and I haven't used it on wet hair.<br />3. Blade changes are sometimes quite difficult and frustrating. I have found that this is dependant upon the location of the rotating post that drives the blades.<br />4. Hair sticks to the handle causing some minor annoyances while shaving.<br />Cosmetic Quality: The unit is not made well - the top chrome plastic piece does not mate with the black base, leaving an unsightly gap. This is undesirable; however, it has no impact on performance<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. The motor is STRONG! It cuts through my tough hairs like buttah!<br />2. It includes 3 blades and a shaving attachment. The 3 blades are great! (I use a straight razor to cut my non-beard hairs so I have no input on the Dual Shaver Attachment)<br />3. It is highly portable for travel.
B00G5L867C|5|Love all the sticker choices and it definitely makes brushing time easier. When I opened the box I let my son pick out which stickers he wanted and he decorated it and that made it fun for him.
B007R6E5OC|2|I originally purchased this for my daughter along with the moisturizing lotion. She went natural about 15 months ago and we are constantly searching for products that will moisturize her soft, dense, coily curls (hair type unknown). I discovered that she was not using the products and elected to use them on myself (no wasting here!). Myself, I am relaxed, but managing two textures (I relax 1-2 times per year). I wear wigs the majority of time to protect my length and am up to trying whatever products are available at home to soften as well as moisturize my new growth. There is a great deal to choose from in the average beauty supply store (it can get truly overwhelming), but price has a great influence in my book. Having had moderate success with other African Pride products, I decided on this.    The product is okay. I think it would work better for those with finer textures as it is not at all heavy or oily, but more water-based. I use it from time to time in conjunction with the lotion using the LOC method. It is neither watery nor extremely thick nor tacky on my hands. I wouldn't classify it as a butter, either. To me, it is not much different than the lotion. Bottom line, it doesn't provide the moisture I am looking for personally. I will use what I have but most likely would not buy it again.
B000G6NOZG|3|I purchased this hoping for something special, and although I like the unique smell, my wife was not impressed...<br />'nuff said.
B007O74NMS|1|Pump doesn't work and spray has turned yellowish.
B00014EI26|5|I'm a law student and also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. I take medications for my illness but my doctor told me I have to find \\"other ways to cope with my anxiety.\\" My friend suggested this oil. Now, when I'm studying, I always have a bit of the oil next to me on a cotton ball. The company uses quality lavender and is reasonably priced and I find myself calmer and looking forward to studytime.
B00MS9P772|1|No it does NOT meet my expectations. I should have been informed that I needed another item with this. So although I'm going to keep the item I now have to order another item. So I'm not really happy but am still going to try the item and hope it works good.
B00N30SE3E|5|Looks good, heats up quickly and works well. Very happy.
B001E6TZHI|5|I use this product daily along with the Burt's Bees Citrus Face Scrub. Good combination. Great products!! Good value for the price.
B000BKPHSE|5|Good product.  Is helping repair damaged cuticles.  Will buy again.  Excellent price and delivery.  My toes love it,<br />Give it a try.
B003USGM9M|5|I love nice n easy,have used it for years
B00O2SRB26|4|It's good hair....... And people don't use hash products on hair please.
B0039BCT56|5|my favorite spray on tan, I never get globs of wet spray tan on me when using this product.
B005CRJUEI|1|This stuff doesn't smell that great.  It doesn't work well either.  Go & buy some cocoa butter & put it on.  It's cheaper & works a lot better.
B00524WE2Q|1|Product is almost about to expire and it was manufactured in 2007 so I am little disappointed.unhappy with the purchase.
B00EYSNWXG|1|I read all of the wonderful reviews about this eyelash curler...and I received mine yesterday. I want a refund!  The eyelash pads don't line up properly nor does the curler itself.
B00BMLOKHU|2|Didn't work for my wife.
B006IBM21K|5|Well, almost 5 stars. I've only used it once so far and it is still a learning experience for me.  The unit itself is good quality and you can fit two hands or feet in together.  I only wish it had a 30 second and a 60 second timer.  The shortest is 90 seconds.
B004AI5JTU|5|Sea-bond works just perfect. My grandmother loves it. She describes it as a miracle. She uses it all the time.
B000MAT7V6|5|Add a touch of color and best of all conditions my hair. I love it this product been using it for years.
B00005JS5C|5|Bought this for two reasons.  I'm a guy who has long eyebrows, and I set this trimmer on (3) and zap! Perfect eybrow length.  It's so fast and easy.  Second; Both me and the wife like to be neat and tidy with the \\"hair down there\\".  This trimmer is a breeze! Perfect length and not too rough.  OH and seems to be durable.  My wife accidentally dropped it in the toilet while doing some trimming!!  It was a clean toilet thank goodness or I'd be ordering another one.  But it still works fine and never missed a beat!
B00467975C|5|I purchased this product at a medical spa, and I must say that I see a big difference. I use it twice a day. Morning and night. I use 5 to 6 drops over face and neck. I have alot of sun damage and spots on face and it has brightened my face and spots are getting lighter and smaller. It leaves your face with a nice pink glow and looks fresh. The price is a bit high, but if you really want to look fresh and need to brighten your face from that dark dull look, get this stuff if worth it.
B00B7RFSH0|1|These colors range from green mud to tangerine. I can't believe I wasted my money
B001PTEP3I|5|--- Good Shampoo --- :)
B000KOUCQ8|5|I have used this cream for years and it works!  It is the strongest hydroquinone concentration you can find without prescription at 3%.<br />It works even better combined with a retinol cream.  However, Walmart sell for $5.25, which is cheaper than Amazon.
B005JV1YRI|1|worst
B002HK2GN0|4|These scissors are sharp and they work smoothly. Other reviewers commented on the small finger openings, and they are a bit small, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  Right now, they grip the hairs well and I can cut closely where needed.
B008S3UJ52|2|they are very pretty but seem to run very small, and when i bought them it didnt show the back so i thought they were normal underwear. im pretty umhappy with this purchase.
B007L0NWBQ|5|My face was burned and this worked very well in fading the dark mark. I no longer have to cake on the foundation
B00XHB2XYA|4|Love it !!
B00D19NK18|5|Good color, but not outragiously fake looking.  And it can be blurred to look just like you want it.
B00375L900|5|I starting using Freeze 24/7 on a cruise. These prices are so much better for the same product. A GREAT buy!
B000068PBT|5|Popped right in, work great, no issues at all.
B000CNIHF0|5|Omg love this, its the only one i wear !!!!!
B007ONF9W0|5|This hair is beautiful actually this is the second time that im using this hair and it's pretty good for the price and it last for up to two months i will be using it again if i can find it.
B00EEIM0OS|5|I titled my original review as \\"Happy Skin, Happy Me\\", and that is still the fact. It has been several weeks since my purchases of the Original Body Brush, the Face Brushes by Sublime Beauty along with the Travel size Skin Brush. I use all the brushes on a daily basis. I actually look forward to my shower because I know I get to Skin Brush my body and face before showering. I find the Travel size Skin Brush the most useful, which is great for everyday, not just for travel, with the Original Body Brush perfect for my back. The Sublime Face Brush is the ideal size for facial contours.<br /><br />I follow the skin brushing as set out in the brochures sent by Sublime Beauty. I am thrilled to report that I no longer have dry, flaky, sometimes referred to as ashy, skin on my legs and arms. I was tired of throwing money away on creams and lotions. I actually went one day without lotions and creams after Skin Brushing and showering. I never thought it would be possible, but Sublime Beauty Brushes have cured my dry skin by eliminating that layer of dead skin cells that attached to my pants, my slippers, my socks, and my tops. I am 62 years old, and with age comes thinner, drier, and more delicate skin. I can't sing the praises of these brushes without sounding gushy, but when a simple idea, perfect brushes solve my dry skin problem there are not enough words.<br />The brush was as described, soft yet firm enough to feel that it's doing its job of sloughing off dead skin cells.  Dry brushing is easy and simple.  I did not notice a marked response by my skin until AFTER my shower.  My Skin was HAPPY!  No joke! This brush does the job as advertised.  And do remember to drink an 8 oz. glass of water afterward, somehow it makes a difference in hydrating your skin.
B002LFV894|2|I guess I expected a real coppery copper.  This is a very muted color and does not appear to have much of a copper tone.  It does not have any shine to it, but I'm not sure if it's supposed to have a shine.  I was highly disappointed in the color and appearance of this lipstick.  I ordered another color (505); a color I have used frequently.  It also appears to be muted.  I'm wondering if this is a batch of rejects or if I just happened upon a couple of not so colorful lipsticks by chance.  I'll likely try #505 again, but will definitely not purchase this copper color again!
B0009DT39C|5|I've been shaving my 'peach fuzz' for years and this is, hands down, the best little shaver I've ever had. buying a second one now just in case. it gets close to the skin and is very efficient. ladies, if you're looking for something for a similar reason, buy it.
B001PUH0K2|5|Works well
B001G7VMTY|3|My mother cannot stand by herself or walk, so I must transfer her from bed to wheelchair and wheelchair to living room chair and then back again all day long. I was told by a nurse that I should be using a back brace and a Gait belt. For some reason, no matter how tight I make the belt, it always slips up to her armpits (under her breasts) every time I try to use it. My mother's body is very pear shaped, so I don't know how much that has to do with it.<br />The belt itself is very stiff and every time I try to make it real tight, she says it hurts her.
B00HSP9QSC|5|After reading all the reviews i decided to still go through and purchase them. Very happy i did. They came extremely fast. I ordered them late sunday night and they arrived by thurday afternoon. Very pleased with the product. There is a glittery brown, a bright red, a light pink and four shades of bright pink. Very pretty and they stay on well. Worth the price.
B0089QL7B8|5|I love this product! It doesn't rub the skin raw when removing the excess tint from skin. It has a nice fragrance and this bottle lasts quite a while. I highly recommend this product, you won't be disappointed.
B00TUACHFC|5|I will start by saying I enjoy the taste of this powder quite a bit. Recently I have been mixing a teaspoon of the Beauty Dust with a teaspoon of Organic Matcha powder in water and it has been a great mid day pick me up. Im not sure how it has been working for my skin yet but I have some breakouts that I'm hoping this dust will help me banish. Overall it is a nice supplement that I have enjoyed adding into my regimen.
B00KXGRFVS|3|I love pretty much all the products in the Baby Lips line so when I saw these I was soooo excited. In the tube this color &#34;pink crystal&#34; looks like a very bright neon pink. There is tons off little iridescent microglitter all throughout as well. The color looks so pretty in the tube, however, when I applied it I was pretty disappointed. It goes on pretty much sheer. I even layered it on thickly and only got the slightest tint of pink. Also the glitter did not stand out and sparkle as much as I assumed it would. It just looked more shiny, not really sparkly. That being said, there are a few good points too. This feels amazing on your lips and leaves them very soft. If you are looking for a sheer moisturizing product this will be great. If you are looking for color....not so much.
B003AVNLP2|5|I use regularly and think it helps keep my aging skin smoother. Used to buy at Walmart, but couldn't rely on the product being in stock. It's actually cheaper than Walmart, which sells them as individual packages.
B0014CBV10|5|i love these pencils, you can wear it all different ways.
B00LPW0EFS|5|Quick delivery, the smell is tantalizing and sweet.
B001MA0QY2|5|Perfect! I needed to replace my GHD flat iron and decided to look at other brands. I read all the wonderful reviews and decided to purchase this one, and wow, I was blown away with this flat iron. Glad I didn't go spend over $200 on another GHD!
B00GTBZ85Q|3|This is a nice product.  Cleans our hair well and leaves it with a good scent.  Our hair is less tangled after we use this.  For us, it's a little on the watery side.  We wish it was a little thicker.  But, it works well for the cost.  It's a big family size bottle, so will last for a long time.
B004KVBMFW|5|It's the best smelling lotion ever. You don't need perfume with this. I'm also very sensitive to smelly lotions and this one doesn't cause any issues.
B007SBFW3Y|2|Does not have the lovely smell of the perfumed lotion I purchased years ago.  I still had some left of the old lotion and loved the way it smells.  This is nothing like it.  It may as well be something purchased from a 10 cent store and left on the shelf in grandma's bathroom for the last 50 years.  The cap came not working, too - it won't close securely.  VERY disappointed.
B009THOFEC|5|Love this stuff!  Smells like a spa in the tropics.This is the real deal at real savings!
B0049OLZ84|5|good
B0082BX3IA|5|super cute! good quality. my almost 2 year old daughter now has a bow for every outfit imaginable. she has a lot of hair and these are adorable.
B00JX979CQ|5|Excellent Emu Oil. Bought from this seller several times.  It is whitish in color as it suppose to be, very oily, yet absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. I use it for sore neck/shoulders muscle pain and I don't know how it happens, but the aches and pain disappear. I also get itchy palms in the afternoons, and one drop into the palms and the itching is gone. I use it before bedtime on face and scalp, my facial skin is supple and bouncy (I need to lose some weight.) and my scalp is healthy. Only 3 drops for the aching muscles, and one drop for the face and scalp. Amazing results. My only question is, &#34;How do they get the oil from the emu?&#34;<br /><br />I hope the answer is simple, like:<br /><br />&#34;We talk to the emu, she signs a consent, we milk her oil glands gently, about once a week, until we fill out a bottle. The emu lives in our vast gardens and receives massage and pedicure once a month . She has a large family so social issues are not involved in obtaining this oil. The entire family is very happy, they have a beautiful playground for the children, and there are at least 43 emus (and counting) in this particular clan. We cook for them and clean after them daily, and TLC cameras are following this emu tribe everywhere they go, including showing how the oil is obtained. It's all perfectly kosher, and everyone benefits.&#34; If anything, buy it for the emu.<br /><br />My husband says they cook the emu, remove the fat, sell it to people, and eat it. No wonder he has no friends.
B000050B6U|5|I had this curling iron over ten years ago and loved it. I traveled a lot during those years, so it eventually gave out. This is exactly the way i remembered it. I'm not sure why it took so long for me to come back to this iron. It is awesome how fast it heats up, maybe a 2 minutes max. I am a person who is always in a hurry in the morning and don't have time to wait on a curling iron to warm up. However, I will say the using the turbo setting may have limited the life of my previous iron, but I feel it is worth it. Also, the price CANNOT be beat! Love Amazon!!
B002TSA93Y|5|i love dove products. this soap doesnt make my skin feel dried out and stretched when im out of the shower. it smells good and cleans great. all my makeup comes off of my face the first wash, and my body feel refreshed. this is my favorite bar soap from
B000C213ZM|4|I prefer colognes with a more wood smell, but this is a good cologne.
B002LA53V8|2|This doesn't quite just melt off all love my wearing gel liners and mascara. Some wiping and rubbing is needed.
B00CDGR29G|4|I purchased this product for one of my daughters and she really likes the diversity of the stamping options. Among the images are flowers, stars, a cat, coffee mugs, floral patterns, lace, etc. Some of the images do not transfer very well but this problem might be fixed with a different stamper. The stamping plates came inside a white case and are individually covered with thin, blue plastic sheets to avoid scratching. Overall my daughter enjoyed this product and now has a different technique of doing nail art.
B0012Y0ZG2|5|I continually get compliments on how wonderful I smell whenever I have used this product- especially when using it with the body lotion. I bought this product at Bath and Body during one of their annual sales a year ago and now they no longer carry it. However, other dealers have it online for $ 45 and the lotion for $45  up to 95? I don't know why Bath & Body stopped selling it.
B007BLN17K|5|I love that they protected the bristles in shipping with plastic tubes. they are in perfect condition!
B00LG63DOM|5|So far I love how my skin feels
B00L0RNOE6|5|GOOD
B00TB7404A|5|The Crest 3D white brightened my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh and clean.  I highly recommend trying this product.<br />It freshens your breath while making your teeth whiter.  It is especially good for coffee and tea drinkers by keeping your teeth white.<br />Try it today and see for yourself.
B000NL0T1G|5|Tried a Safety Razor with plastic in it prior to this one... obviously was not happy. This one cost more...but is worth the extra $. The extra weight gives a more solid shave. Still looking for best most complementary blades. Happy searching!
B0059856B6|3|Love it!!!!!
B005GS69KG|2|Bad command
B0006HCE60|5|i keep ordering it..so what does that tell you...great for homemade concoctions
B00O30OOLO|5|Love the clean fragrance. Lasts for a long time. Great product!
B000EVIWEG|5|Great!
B005967L7U|5|Feels wonderful! Big enough for larger feet and works good for small ones also! Soothing bubbles feel so much better than the vibration of other foot baths!
B007O0J8RU|5|I'm allergic to 4-5 of the emollients that make bathroom products creamy and hold all the ingredients in nice suspension, so I tend to go for soaps.  I bought these based on the ingredients.  They are my favorite soaps so far.  I take a bar with me when I travel.  Since these soaps lather so well, I also use them for shaving while traveling.  Unlike 80% of soaps which say they are, these soaps are truly moisturizing without pore clogging junk.
B003YJAZZ4|5|Like all of my previous Braun shavers, this 790 performs great-- shaves close and is very reliable. It was delivered several days ahead of schedule and I am very happy with it.
B000FI5WF0|5|Very useful product. Made of sturdy material. For me it won't carry two weeks supply. Good for about 4 days. But, you probably would not want to carry a larger case with you. The cooling packs are good for a day and easily refrozen in a freezer overnight. I find many hotels now have refrigerators  in guest rooms.
B00401DCOQ|5|This is the second time I order this. My husband really likes it and I love the scent. I also got this earlier than the expected date😊
B005F2EVAI|5|This is a my go-to makeup remover.  It has no oily residue, but gets the job done on the toughest of water resistant mascara and foundations.  A pump dispenser makes it even better.
B00A7KLMOG|5|Not a bad deal. Lots of things I didn't want to buy separately. It was nice to just get it all together.
B00162SB8E|4|Good product, fair price and fast delivery.
B003A8AHG6|1|I read about this makeup in a magazine and it claimed that it was good for older skin.  It is very thick and looks very unnatural on my skin.  I  threw it out immediately. I like minimal coverage but if you like thick coverage then it might be what you are looking for.
B0009VIS7M|5|love this stuff, wish they hadn't discontinued.
B00G6SAOSS|5|Best I ever tried. No orange color....easy to use...okay smell and a great look on skin. Does not give you an unnatural looking tan. Highly recommend it.
B000C1VYHU|5|Out of all the colognes I have Tried over the years but have rarely found something I could wear everyday. this product always give me so many compliments about how great it smells. Also the price is just right for the size and for what other stores and sites charge.
B00CQGUT9S|5|This is the first wig I have ever bought and I am VERY impressed. It's nice material, very thick and silky. It isn't shiny like most cheap wigs are which is a huge plus. I plan on buying a red one for an Ariel costume.
B000F6RFX4|3|This soap really is good for people who have eczema. I have had eczema ever since I was very young. However, the past several months my eczema has become very severe, and I actually had to get a shot from the dermatologist to help keep my outbreaks and inflammation down. I am very aware of the different types of soaps/ skin care products that are good for people who have eczema, but my skin is still irritated by a lot of them. This dead sea mud soap has worked tremendously for my eczema, and it has been an incredible blessing.  I have to say, I've tried a few other dead sea mud soaps that are out there, and Adovia has been one of the best. Although I can say Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap has been the best soap for my eczema so far, the price increase is utterly ridiculous. When I first started buying this soap, it only cost around $8 a bar. Now that it's $18.99 + $3.10 shipping, I have to say I can no longer buy Adovia. $8 a bar was already higher than most other dead sea mud soap brands, and one bar goes by so fast (mud soap doesn't last as long as regular bar soaps).  I would rate Adovia 5 stars for the product, but the price doesn't even make it worth it. It's really sad for me, because I thought I had finally found something to help my severe eczema (a skin condition people are born with and has no real \\"cure\\") without having to constantly pay so much money.
B00DI9C986|4|This is a great lite moisturizer. It dries quickly and not greasy. I did not give it 5  stars because I thought it would be a bit heavier. I have very dry skin so this absorbs fast and after a couple of hours it feels like I need to apply more. This would be great for someone with oily skin to use. But for the amount you get you can't beat the price and the pump in the jar makes for great application.
B009XPRZJW|3|Ok
B004G5EEH0|5|I bought this product because I wanted an cellulite solution and read that one of the only proven ingredients against cellulite is caffeine, this product has more caffeine than any of the expensive cellulite creams and works the best. It has a light peppermint sent and feels refreshing and cool on the skin, I even use it on my face to increase blood flow and it feels great, this is a product I have ordered over and over again.
B00AFCP350|4|I really liked this product. I've only used it a few times, but it seems to do as it says. Will more then likely purchase again when I am finished with this bottle I have.
B00OU5LZBO|5|As good as you'd hope, and so cute, too.  I used for homemade mosquito repellant, my grandkids just loved it.  Now all their cousins and friends want some, too, and they all specifically asked for the cool blue jars.  These jars are a big winner.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Excellent product.  Makes you gums feel good and helps keep them in good condition.  I use dental floss, so I don't know how effective it is for flossing, but the massaging feature is definitely a 5 star rating.  It's easy to use and doesn't take much time.
B002YLEQ2Q|5|My favorite mascara, I have long lashes but they get tangled and clumpy with most mascaras. This one does the trick..the want isn't that flimsy flexible crap that most of them are today..those don't grab my lashes like this does. Good stuff. Brand new in the packaging when received.
B00NFFPNKE|4|My wife loves this stuff...if you use it right.  Just a pea sized dab rubbed all over your hands to thin it out and then run through your hair.  Just the right amount of help for her moderately curly hair to look good without using a hair dryer.
B00150LT40|4|I've heard a lot of buzz about this product. It's supposed to stop your nail polish from chipping.  Painted my nails Saturday night and Sunday by bedtime they were chipped.  Meh.  I do like how it makes your  nails dry quicker, though.
B00KVI3ZGC|5|I used Janet Collection Afro kinky bulk 24 &#34; for my kinky twists. The order comes with 4 packs, but my stylist only used two. This hair looks natural. I have type 4 hair. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a more natural look as opposed to the shiny look some kanekalon products have.
B007NNU2WI|5|I'd never even heard of a &#34;pore filler&#34; before I ordered it.  It's not magic, but it's impressive.  I only use it on the bridge and sides of my nose, but it definitely makes a difference.
B00AZGHGQ0|1|The picture shows a full bottle and it turned out to be the rollerball. I admit not reading the small print but I felt cheated as the picture was misused to &#34;lie&#34; about the product. It was a complete rip off!
B002PYLKH6|5|These sponges are great for applying Snazaroo makeup.  They work best when they are damp, not soaking wet.  They are big enough that you can use them to quickly cover a face in a base coat, but small enough that you can use them for blending, detail work, and creating texture.<br /><br />I have been using Snazaroo makeup for more than a decade and have found that for creating quick faces for either face painting at a fair or turning out hordes of zombies for a halloween trail or zombie walk.<br /><br />Also the price is great, it is really nice to be able to use a fresh sponge on each new face.
B000GLRREU|5|The Waterpik works as advertised. I've been using it a month and love it. Take your time increasing the settings as this thing can produce some pretty large pressures. Even directly after brushing my teeth I'm amazed to see lit food bits this thing finds and removes.  Would definitely buy again.
B007A50P4E|4|as expected
B004TSFE28|5|Just excellent
B00T09ZU48|5|These are a great size for samples of body products or for putting in your purse. They also look very professional and seem quite sturdy, especially with the double wall. However, that makes them bigger than other 1/2 oz containers.
B0012K3RFM|5|Does it's job! Will order next time.
B0062IWQVU|4|My husband got this razor as part of the BzzAgent program. He wears a goatee and used the razor and trimmer set to clean up his face and trim the hair of his goatee. It does a nice job. THe razor provided a close shave without causing any skin irriation or cuts. The trimmer offers several adjustable lengths to cut the hair at so he could cut it a little shorter or leave it longer if her wished. The interchargable trimmer/razor top is a great feature. It makes for less clutter in the bathroom cabinet! :) My husband said he would recommend thsi razor/trimmer system. You can't beat it for the price, either!
B000068PBT|5|Bought this for my 19 year old grandson for Christmas. He said that it gives a very close shave and he loves it. He even used it for shaving his chest and stomach.
B002VSVY0O|5|I got some of these as part of a sampler pack.  Today was my 12th shave with the same blade.  I have never achieved that kind of longevity with any other double edged razor blade--very impressive.
B0031Q8NQ8|1|DO NOT BUY - EXPENSIVE RIP OFF!  I have used electric rollers for 40 years now and made a big mistake when I paid $52 for this set from Sally's.  They do not get hot enough, the clips keep falling out, and the little bit of curl comes completely out within one hour.  I am very disappointed and wish I had taken the time to review them first.
B002JIX8S2|4|Other reviews said these were hard to take off, but I found no issue. The recommendation on the package is to wear these only for 4-6 hours or less. I wore once for 5 hours and had no issue taking off; wore another time over night (probably a total 13-14 hours) and it was a little more adhered to me, but not hard to take off. Of course every body is different, and would follow the company's recommendation first.<br />I also felt no residue left on me.<br />I do have sensitive skin, even around my areola I get zits and have dry skin - and this product did not cause me to have any reaction.<br />I am a C cup - never pregnant - and almost 30 (breast still perky). I don't mind my ladies being free, but my nipples are almost always hard, so going bra-less in sheer tops feel uncomfortable. Though this product did not conceal my h.n. 100%, it was 75% better than being fully free.<br />To me, the product is too pricey for 5 pairs; so I won't be buying these often and only use when I really need to be conservative for outfits that don't look right with bras.
B002X9RLZS|5|Gift for the wife. She loves it, so i love it. Brushed Nickel finish matches perfectly our decor. The unit is nice and hefty, wont tip over. LED and should yield long battery life.
B004TQMQQM|5|This is my color and I can never find it. I was told it had been discontinued, so where do I look? You got it, Amazon.com! This is very easy to apply, smooth glide for lining eyes. It came in a 2 pack, but I am wondering if I should get more! A little pricey I think, but tired of looking!
B00T3EDQDC|5|The main reason I was so taken by this product is first,it has a great smell!! And second it feels very light and I could safely say it stays on your skin for more than a couple of hours. Third I have had several comments of how great it smells and that makes a person feel good.
B00BB8ZIRK|5|Awesome flat iron. my last flat iron cost $250 I dropped it last week and broke the ceramic plate so I ordered this flat iron and it is 10 times better than my last one. it does a great job
B001SA5DZS|1|i finish the product but it didn't work at all..i thought maybe by continous using it acne will appear more and will go away after few weeks but instead my face got worse..im so embarrassed to go out ..so dissapointed!
B00DF6KPUG|5|Love it
B00LV21TCY|5|I have used this product for about 6 months now.  It really makes my hair feel fuller and thicker. It has helped my hair grow back after it was falling out due to a medication was taking. I highly recommend this product.
B000FEF1V4|5|Trimmer works great!  Only problem that I see with it, is the vacuum could work better.
B003P5DUAE|5|Thanks!
B00GMXIZE2|4|Love this product...after 2 days my skin looks fabulous!  My otherwise larger pores are minimized and my skin looks smooth.  Still working on the lip lines though.
B000C1Z2J6|5|My husband has been wearing this cologne for the past 22+ years, and it never gets old.  I Love to hug him and breath in that wonderful smell!!!<br />This is the first time I order it through Amazon and was a bit sceptical, but figured that the big savings was worth a shot.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised when I received it and would definitly recommend it to everyone.  Thanks for offering this product.
B00013TQPQ|5|taste great, leaves mouth feeling fresh and new and ready to tackle more crap that i eat.
B00INRBTK2|1|This product is horrible. The heat is weak and the clamps don't fully clamp down so it doesn't reach your hair completely. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B00EB1RQME|5|My Favorite Color.  Love the product
B00DLAY0LQ|5|Worked well for me and my mum. We both have curly hair and there was no tugging whatsoever so we are very happy with our purchase!
B004OG27ZC|5|This stuff is great!!! I have super long thick curly hair, and it tames it without weighing it down :D
B000HF4PE0|1|I purchased this device to help me don my compression stockings. They tend to twist when I insert my foot. They are painful, not helpful.
B000BUFFPO|2|After many disappointing attempts at using a non aluminum deodorant, I came across Burt's bees spray sage oil deodorant after reading about it in an online magazine editorial where the writer tried different ones and ranked them. Bought this at a local grocer for about 7 bucks. So happy I found this!! 2 sprays each underarm and it dries very quickly. The fragrance is light and smells earthy/citrusy as you would expect from the sage and lemon oil mix. I have found the scent wears off after a while but leaves you with clean, dry NON-SMELLY pits for a whole day!!! This has lasted me through intense workouts and runs in 82 degree weather. I have not found anything more effective in a non-aluminum deodorant and this even beats the aluminum Dove I used to use!! Highly recommend!!  Update 4/23/2017: I am not sure if I was still using aluminum intermittently, if all of the aluminum was not out of my body, or if my body got used to this, but it stopped working after a couple weeks and I most definitely started getting BO stink only a couple hours after application. I have been using Green Tidings for at least a year now and I can say THAT is the only non-aluminum deodorant I have found that works for me out of what I have tried.
B000052YL1|2|This is a bacterial soap. Money wasted because it didn't anything as claimed. I could easily buy bacterial soap from my local stores
B00GQJR25A|4|I love this - such a simple idea but genius concept! No more headaches, it's perfect for a bad hair day, &#34;pineapples&#34; at night, the gym, etc. The $11 price tag may be a bit much for such a simple tool but I think it's worth it. My hair is super thick 4a/4b and I use this without any issues or problems. I plan to purchase another one as a backup just in case :-)
B0028AGZVS|4|I have been using medicalia sunscreen for the past five (5) years at least. It looks like makeup and offers the protection I need on a daily basis from harmful sunrays. My only concern is it leaves a residue on your face and MUST be cleaned every night before bed to maintain a clear complexion...... at least for me.... I also use the cleanser and toner!!!! I am very happy with this product.
B005BIF4BG|5|This product is exactly what they stated it is. It is first quality and I like to buy this for my wife. I'm trying to make 20 words here because I really don't want to do a long review. :)
B0002GPHNC|5|Great transaction, received it as stated and it's perfect!!  Thank you!!! I would purchase from Amazon again.  This was my first time and I was thrilled it was as easy as can be.
B0009R14Y0|2|Shipment of 4 bottles was in a envelope and one bottle leaked half its contents. Bottles were not sealed or have caps. Hope the contents is correct.
B008JWW5K4|4|I love the brushes! Very soft and doesnt shed only problem I had was the nail salon smell that came with the opening the set. Not nessicarly a bad smell but I'd prefer not to have it in my bathroom. Great product ^_^
B00068A0AQ|5|This product gives such great shine to my hair and makes it feel really soft. It also gets rid of the fly aways
B004UKSLFC|2|The packaging and the hype on it would lead you to believe that this is the perfect tool for keeping perfectly trimmed and shaped facial hair. I am underwhelmed.<br /><br />It seems exactly like a no-name item I bought a Walmart for about $10 a few years ago that was marketed as a bikini-line trimmer. It is about the size of a large pen and is powered by one AAA battery. It comes with 2 plastic heads that are supposed to allow you to trim hair to a certain length. Without the heads attached, it is a micro-head trimmer that lets you trim close to the skin. It does come with a rather nice, little stand that keeps it upright when not in use.<br /><br />The problem is that the teeth are really too fine to trim my husband's thick mustache or beard hair. Without the heads, it works nicely to trim hair off of ears and to neaten up the edges of his stache and beard, but won't work for keeping his beard or mustache a uniform length. I did use it to trim my 8 year old's sideburns between haircuts and it worked well on his baby-fine hair.<br /><br />Braun usually makes fine products and I own several, but I can't say that I recommend this product for the purposes it seems to advertise.
B00EXJOPWI|1|It tastes like soap, hardly foams at all and is not creamy at all.  I think I just paid for soapy water!
B000052XZP|5|Using this shampoo got rid of my scalp itch.  However, when I left it on too long some of my hair broke off.  Now I shampoo with it briefly and infrequently only as needed.
B000063XHQ|4|This unit works like a champ, but drop it once and it's stone cold dead. I'm on my third one. But they're relatively inexpensive, so one can almost think of them as disposable.
B008A2BE9Q|5|Avlon Keracare Edge Tamer is a wonderful product for curly hair.  I am so glad I tried this product.  It is works so well in humid weather.
B004EMEJKM|5|Great Product! Works great. I would buy again and I use it twice a day. My teeth are really white
B001ADU3IA|4|It's ok just seems to work same as store bought foundation
B0067QXE5Y|3|Although the equipment is made out of serugical stainless steel some of the forceps are poorly cut with a couple of metal splinters. Im a bit dissapointed.
B002F50FYE|5|This product is of way higher quality than another one I bought from an ebay seller a few years back. Comes in a super great case and also with instructions if you need them. Shipping was extremely fast also. Thanks for the awesome product!
B0011NPAI2|5|I've never in my life been stopped by someone to ask what shadow I have on til I got this. I only have the color \\"Shooting star\\" but it's pretty darn wonderful. It is black with swirls of gold. You might not think of using black on your eyes but if you put it just in the creases and and/or on the outer corner this is very dramatic with any other color you might be wearing and not the least bit overbearing. You can also wet the pigment and then line your eyes for a smoky eye look.<br /><br />I get compliments on it because the gold flecks on black in shooting star are just dramatic. It's a keeper and makes my eyes really pop<br /><br />Negative: I wish it came with an applicator or at least a place to keep an applicator. I hate having it loose in my make up bag...but I overlook this flaw outta love. (grin)<br /><br />and it lasts all day.
B001H928HQ|4|I believe the product is great. But I need to learn how to apply it! So, that is my own fault... The brush is precised and the color is chocolate brown.
B001QY8QXM|5|I love these blades and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a close shave at a very insanely reasonable price.  Simply put, these blades are sharp, durable, and at the price they charge, you can choose to have a new blade every day.
B008KNCSIG|5|Just received my molded trays the other day and they fit very well.  They are very flexible and leaps and bounds beyond those trays you drop into a hot water and mold to your teeth.  Those would make me gag if they reached too far back in my mouth and were so bulky.  These you can literally wear them around and it's almost unnoticeable that you have them on.  And because they are form-fitting to your teeth, you can talk  with them on and not sound entirely weird.<br /><br />The only thing I thought was misleading was the picture provided, it makes it appear as if you get a dozen syringes of whitening gel and I received only (2).  After further research though, I realized that they send you either (6) syringes of an oz. each I believe or (2) syringes of 3 oz. each, so those (12) smaller syringes must be 1/2 oz. syringes.  No worries though, if you leave a 5-star rating, they send you (5) more syringes for free as a thank you gesture, and if you don't like something, before leaving a less than 5-star rating, just contact them and they will try to fix the issue for you.  I didn't have to do that, but you can see the many other reviews from people that thought they were quite helpful and customer service oriented.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with this producte, ...let's see if I get those (5) extra syringes now.
B000O2OWF8|5|I have had one of these for about 6 years now, and mine is now just dying a slow death :) I LOVE IT!
B0039OLUDU|3|The main reason I got this is for the scent. I visited the Westin hotel one time and they had this line of products and i was totally obsessed. The reason I only give 3 stars is because of the price and it does't really have any healing properties that I know of, so if you are looking for something to soothe extremely dry skin, this may not be your best bet, but I would still recommend this to a friend
B00016XJ4M|5|This has a lovely, light scent.  A great alternative to traditional witch hazel.
B00A42Q7QK|5|These oils are nice and strong ~ the scents are rich.  The quality is excellent. I love the little box they came in ~ which makes them a great potential gift for someone new to aromatherapy.  (these oils and a book ~ how could you go wrong?) ~ Very nice selection, very fair price.  Item was received quickly and in excellent condition.<br /><br />As the description states, you will receive the following 6 scents ~ Eucalyptus, Lavender, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Sweet Orange and Tea Tree.
B000052YQ2|5|Quality stuff!!!
B0074MNCDY|5|the best face wash I have ever used--I've had moderate acne my whole life and this helps without over drying and irritation. it also has helped with my bacne as well.
B001ET6ZTG|1|It only takes one word....HORRID!!!!
B00D8ZOVIQ|5|Works great.
B00G8SZE3Q|5|Bought another bottle...hair thicker and grew a bit too
B009SNBFRW|4|i bought this wig for roxy lalonde and when i got it i was THRILLED. it's so beautiful and i love how it spikes upwards at the end - i hardly had to do any styling other than the bangs and the curl! my only complaint is that it's shorter than i expected. they put the measurement but i didn't actually expect it to be that short (around my chin). still though, a GREAT wig and i would definitely recommend it to fellow roxy cosplayers.
B004SKUFY4|5|They're colorful and there's quite a variety of color for just the occasion.  They are not perfect but they are great to dress up and to keep your hair in place.  Sometimes, your gets wrapped around the end of the comb, so you gotta watch that.  I've received compliments and I can't wait to share my sentiments.
B00365DABC|3|Ok-- I need a richer cream -this one more like lotion.
B009YE6JDK|5|Excellent
B00SKQFT4I|5|I have never used an Ionic Ceramic hair dryer so when I was given the chance to test this one for quality, I couldn't pass it up.  I have long hair, not extremely thick but with the winter weather here in Indiana, the frizzies have set in.  It has been so bad, I have had to use argon oil on it just to tame it down to a manageable level.  I was so impressed with this hair dryer and here's why:<br /><br />1.  My hair dried in about half the time as with my previous hair dryer.  And that was only on the medium heat setting.  The high heat was too high for me as I have a sensitive scalp.<br /><br />2.  The cord on the dryer is longer than other I have owned.  I was able to move around without pulling the cord from the wall.  It is lightweight and powerful.<br /><br />3.  The shape of the dryer has a longer barrel which allowed me to dry my hair from underneath.  Since it is so long, dryers with shorter barrels don't allow me to do this.<br /><br />4.  No frizzies!  My hair dried sleek and static free. The concentrator nozzle allowed me to dry one section of my hair at a time very quickly. I did not have to use argon oil on it after blow drying.<br /><br />After trying this ionic, ceramic hair dryer, I will never go back to using a conventional one.
B001D2GPS0|1|I bought this after reading what must have been phony reviews, then after ten days was charged $70 for a second jar. I am still trying to get that recovered. If the product was good, they wouldn't have to trick you into buying it using phony reviews on Facebook and tiny print. The cream feels rough, it just sits on top of my skin and won't rub in well. And, zero results. I'm going back to oil of olay. Don't fall for their tricks. Do not buy this product. The rep was so experienced in arguing with customers, you know he's had the conversation many times. Feel like a sucker! Too old for that!
B00O71O8XS|4|Fast delivery, good product
B003A2OWWW|5|I absolutely LOVE this stuff , the best thing that was ever made to get rid of marks & dark spots !
B003Q1EGUA|5|Love the products and the service was outstanding!!
B000UJSEZO|5|This was my first purchase of HerStyler products so I bought on a whim and I am so glad I did.  The shampoo and conditioner smell terrific and leave my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  The hair spray was an added bonus!
B002VECITO|5|I love it
B005973JDY|5|This is perfect set of tools for doing micro ring extensions. They are durable and get the job done. I am a hairstylist and these are great beginning tools for micro ring extensions.
B0084FIET2|4|Easy application, does not dry out lips, lasting color. On me the color is a brick red. I have more natural pigment in my lips than most, so colors are darker on me. This one is perfect. In the red family, but not bright red. Get it!
B0075QVOFW|4|It probably isn't long enough to tell yet , but I believe the large age spots on my face have faded significantly .  I don't wear makeup and have felt self-conscience about them .
B00161DXW4|5|I own the next size up and love them...bought these to travel with, but they<br />are a great size for home also...and work just as great as my larger (and older)<br />ones do.  I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this brand to anyone, and this particular<br />one was a great price!  I gave near to 20.00 for my older pair.  The best tweezers<br />I have ever purchased, and they are at least 4 yrs old, and have never had to be<br />sharpened either...keep your new ones in the case to protect the tips.
B000UULQMQ|5|Very good product!
B005OZLG2W|3|This is my first Sigma brush.  My biggest trouble with eyeshadow is blending...I can't seem to get my eyeshadows blended out well.  So, I thought this large brush would help with that problem.  It works well and I also use it for putting on color under the eye brow.  I think it would be great for applying highlighter, too.  It's not quite as soft as I thought it would be, but like I said, this is my first Sigma brush, so maybe my expectations were unrealistic.  I do have a Sigma brush set on order that hasn't been delivered yet.
B004LTZ0VK|5|Fabulous!  Silky skin that smells delicious!
B0018EJMOW|4|The only difference in the Phat Master Clipper and the Improved Master Clipper is the bottom blade.  The appearance is different too of course. There are NO COMBS that fit the Phat Master. I purchased this because I fade my hair starting at #1 and fade it up to 2.  The top of my hair I use 3 and 4.  I thought the recommended combs will fit the Phat Master.  NO COMBS FIT!!!.   You can buy an Improved Master Blade Set for $25 and change the bottom Phat Blade.  You only have to remove 2 screws.  Only install the bottom Improved Master blade.  Continue the hair cut using combs. Note: The smaller top blades are the exact same.   Or just buy the Improved Master which goes from 000-1 then use combs.  I like the look of the Phat Master and would rather just start my fade out with the Phat blade then switch the out to the bottom Improved Master blade, and use combs.        Noticed the clipper began to get very warm after a 20mins. I adjusted the side screw to what is recommended, It was to tight. Not sure if that has anything with the warmth.     Great cut great appearance. Great blade adjust lever.  Easy fading from #1A to #2!!    I'd give it a 5 stars if it had COMBs that fit.   I don't thing they should advertise \\"Perfect for All-Around Styling\\".  This is more for just #1A to #2 like the box says. NO COMBS FIT!!!
B00KU8FYN0|5|Love it!!!! My hair is getting thicker and shiny
B000ODKH4M|3|They're good enough because I didn't feel like going to the store to by scrubby gloves. They are rough, but I like that for a mild exfoliation. They're not stellar, but they're not terrible either. The only thing is that they're probably not worth the price on amazon.
B003YJAZZ4|5|This is the way to go. I have studied this. Nothing better. Comfortable and clean every time. Do clean it every time. Buy the replacement fluid here on Amazon... best price in all the land.
B007E0FR84|5|I have had frizzy, coarse, wavy/curly, dry hair for all of my life.  I have tried many conditioners and leave-in mousses and 'shiny/smoothing gels\\" but none of them work for more than the time it takes me to walk outside into heat and humidity!  This Keratin hair dryer really does the trick.  Is my hair perfectly smooth?  No but I wasn't expecting it to be.  Does it look almost 100% better than with a normal hair dryer?  Absolutely!<br /><br />I will add that I did not have sopping wet hair but had towel and air dried my hair for about 30 minutes so since my hair is very thick that is only surface layer in the very front dry-ish!
B000VDUOFM|5|This product will definitely grow your lashes and eyebrows. The first time I bought the product I got it specifically to grow back my eyebrows which had been butchered by over waxing at the salon. I figured why not try it on my eyelashes too. The results were really amazing! My eyebrows grew in! No sparse areas! Areas of my eyebrows I was sure would never have hair again, had hair! The eyelashes were just as amazing! Longer, luscious lashes! I am very, very pleased with the results.
B00014FTTM|4|A good product for the money.  There is so many facial firming products out there, but I have been using this one regularly for a couple of years.
B000ALIKAG|5|Very good
B00I3VHKVK|1|These had such a strong smell and my brushes were hard.
B001QY8QXM|5|I enjoy s good blade. Its so sharp that I sometimes cut myself cause I press a little too hard. The glue on the blades from the wax doesn't effect the sharpness of the blades.
B003BF2GC6|5|The best clay mask I ever used besides (remember Mudd back in the day) well this one is awesome, cleans deeply, gets really tight as is dries on your face, and so many people have told me &#34;your skin looks so good, glowing&#34; hands down. I used to purchase it right from the company in California every month, Amazon has at a cheaper price.....a good bang for the buck.
B003TQPRGY|5|awesome !!!!!!!!
B00CJ2UOLM|4|Love this conditioner maes hair sift and repairs it. My hair dresser was impressed with the condition of my hair
B003H8183U|5|First time I used I feel 2 dry my lip.But 2nd time I used I just thinking I put lipgloss,It turn softer my lip in the color is vibrant:)
B001QXBXHO|4|The perfume does smell a tiny bit dough-y if you spray on too much, but otherwise it's a nice perfume to get.
B0018C3V5A|4|It works very well, I just wish it had more variables with the settings.  It has a lot of air (almost too much) or not enough.  It dries my hair quickly and it leaves it in good condition.  A bit expensive, but I did not want something from China I would have to replace in a year.  No good way to store the cord.
B008W8FWCI|5|A great priduct.
B000PKYCJA|5|Good
B000WMYFK2|5|My daughter wore this at her sweet 16. Looked Great! Made very well.
B00B840UKW|4|Lots of varied designs from cutesy to more ornate well etched<br />works well with a varetiy of polishes both stamping and normal polish
B000GLRREU|5|it's the best.  good power to get the job done.  Would recommend this to anyone thinking of buying a water flosser. C.Koehler
B004GWVPI4|3|This is NOT the same as the cream.  It works OK, and is a good alternative to common deodorants; works a couple days and is easy to quickly put on.  The cream lasts for a week and will be what I buy for extended trips away from a proper bath.  I mistakenly thought the two were the same.
B0080CO2F4|4|VERY INEXPENSIVE, LOVELY, HOLDS MY THICK HAIR GREAT AND I GET COMPLIMEMNTS ALL THE TIME, FOR WHAT ITS WORTH, ITS BEAUTIFUL AND I WOULD GIVE THIS AS A GIFT, OR RECCOMEND TO A FRIEND
B0006PLPBC|2|I haven't been abele to do anything with this. I'm better off using finger nails. I'm afraid it sounded and looked more useful then it is.
B000C1W5GY|5|it's great
B000NBQUNW|5|I eat 3 a day and my blood work is within normal limits. My doctor is very happy and so am I. I was on a statin drug and I had horrible side effects. I went off the drug and started using these chews with great results I couldn't be happier. They also curb my sweet tooth! They taste great to me.
B000ORMOYY|5|i chose this rating because my order was just as it was advertised,it was mailed as they had advertised also
B0046MMAZG|2|I used this product hoping it would color my hair brown but it just didn't work. I'm currently blonde and maybe its the reason why it did not take - not sure.
B0053E08KU|2|I think I just got Amazon Prime fever and decided to buy this on a whim. A waste of $5, just use a washcloth! This has very fine bristles that won't extract anything.
B001MA0QY2|5|My sister loves it. Faster and better than the instyler. She couldn't be happier. Gets hot very fast.
B0002AHY6Q|3|I bought it for My sister in a nursing home. She said it works fine.
B0019ZEVZU|1|Bought this hoping to have a reliable, well made product. No such luck. And customer &#34;care&#34; is nonexistent. They dont care if you spend over 110 bucks on a toothbrush and it doesn't last. Better products out there for this price. Oh but wait, they did offer me 15% off my next purchase. Cluelessness confirmed. what a joke. Sonidon't Care.
B002PBACLY|5|I LOVE this line of L'Oreal shampoos and conditioners.  They are thick and rich and work wonderfully.  The rosemary mint smell great, I have tried the other smells and don't like them as much.  I have been using these for about a year now and have finally found a product I want to stick with!
B000A2KJNG|2|The color is not like the original Mac color!  Oh well - that is what I get from ordering it on-line.
B004KS0NIM|5|I just love Sally Hansen Hard as Nails Xtreme Wear, White On ! I got this to do the water marble nails as a base. There are so many different way's to use this ! It works wonderful !  A little goes a long way ....  This will be the only brand I will buy from here on out !<br /><br />Fast shipping , Packed really good so nothing was broken . I would tell anyone to buy this ! My Daugher went out and got her own bottle infact . She didn't want to shair lol !  I feel the price was fair & resonable as well !  Thank you !
B004BCT7A2|5|It looks perfect! It's really easy to apply, blends really well, love the variety of colors and it last me all day long (I use waterproof mascara) so I have no problem with black smudges at the end of the day.
B00P9Q69C8|5|I love love love love LOVE these bags!!!!! I'm so pleased with my purchase! I use the smaller one as a pencil pouch. I have ink joy paper mate pens, bic velocity pens, bic sparkle mechanical pencils, sharpies, and erasers in this bag! It is quite small, but the pens and pencils fit PERFECTLY! I use the big one as an essentials bag, complete with pads, liners, midiol, a travel sized mini hair brush, scrunchies, body wash, earrings, and baby wipes!  I ADORE these bags and they are soooo cute! They match my backpack perfectly !
B00IXX091Q|5|High quality brush. Perfect for putting on powder.
B002VCXIEK|5|Beautiful plate! Unfortunately I did not take a picture of my design before I took my polish off but I am very pleased! This plate was exactly what I was hoping for!!!
B00SX7XEKA|5|Awesome dealer  Great product
B001MA0QY2|1|Can't really rate the iron for it's effectiveness because the one I received has a damaged chipped/cracked plate and I'm not going to snag, rip out my hair on this thing so I have to return it.  But, I ordered a replacement and if this one is not defective I will update my review.
B000KOHTQ4|5|Haven't been able to find this locally anymore and hope that Amazon will continue to carry this product as long as it is made.  I love the highlighting system and this shade is very natural and looks good on.  I'll continue to buy it as long as I can.
B001S2PLNK|5|It solved the mold problem of my brush. Glowing in the dark is a little useless though ? You shouldn't brush your teeth in the dark !!!
B0002JGU30|5|So smooth without making my hands feel slimy. Love the peppermint and it's hard to find!
B00KZDWL7W|5|Great product - I have used oregano oil in the past so was not disappointed, arrived quickly and quickly cleared up the issue...will not hesitate to order from Zane Hellas again - and thank you for the loose oregano sample!
B00KOW827M|5|Very nice!
B00GUOSL10|5|Excellent, exactly as pictured
B00OYEXE1U|5|very good
B0014VTOAQ|4|good stuff
B0019R0V5M|5|I've been using this product for over eight years.  My dermatologist has commented on my skins appearance, and wanted to know what I use.  It has really helped with age spots and sun spots.  I apply daily to my face, neck, and hands.  This is a great price.
B0009OAGY2|5|The perfect gift
B006FJMPZS|5|Fabulous product!
B001EB9JTW|5|Great product.
B006W2SZT8|5|My husband loves this.. Best electric razor ever!
B004MEWOQS|5|This is by far the best SPF lotion.<br />It smells the best and it lasts a good amount.<br />Both wifey and I love it.
B000JMFZQI|5|This is a great candle.  It smells wonderful, but not overpowering.  Worth the price. I will keep buying it as long as they keep making it.
B0012KUW6O|5|Really good!
B0035RE2TA|5|I bought this to drybrush my skin for exfoliation and cellulite reduction and it does a wonderful job. Doesn't scratch like other brushes have.
B003C4AUCY|5|Works well. Leaves scalp flake free after several washings. Contains no fragrance to trigger a reaction. I would recommend with out hesitation.
B006DU3KD0|5|very satisfactory
B001AJ6YS2|5|After using Norelco's for 25+ years now I would have to say: 1. this is the closest shave I've ever got from one and 2. in todays money this is the most inexpensive Norelco I've ever purchased.
B0009Y6RHM|5|great sun product, found out about on youtube and decided to try. Give great nice tan color for my pale skin, i am looking like after vacation! so happy!
B00H3427YI|4|Replacement toothbrushes are fitting in.They do the cleaning job at least as well as the originals.Plus you can`t beat the price
B005W1DZG8|5|This curling wand is amazing! My friend bought me one for my birthday, and it is the only thing I use to curl my hair. It makes perfect curls, and it is very easy to use. It only has one heat setting, so you have to leave it on for a while. I have thick coarse hair, and it takes a while to curl, this iron makes it faster and easier. My curls hold for weeks! If you want something good, that you won't burn your fingers with, this is perfect for you. Don't waste your money on a regular wand, the gloves get in the way, and you can still burn yourself. I have tried curling irons and wands, and this, by far is my favorite! You won't regret buying this.
B005CWWTVE|5|great color,lasts for weeks and weeks. this is the best polish i have ever worn.
B000YBZS0C|5|- Girls, these are the best mood lipstick ever ! ! !  -  It stays on your lip almost the whole day and the color(blue)-is very subtle and light pink color for day or night.   - It just makes you look very pretty and natural. I have been using Fran Wilson for about 10 years. I used to buy from QVC but they are no longer carry it now.  - I am so glad to find them on Amazon.......Amazon has everything that you want to find....Amazon rocks!  - This mood lipstick come with very subtle color/s change that doesn't make you look like a clown.
B001B8OLXM|5|I am in love with this hair mask. It smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft. The shipping was fast as well. Very happy with this purchase.
B00GHK0LGK|3|I was very excited to receive a quick response regarding this line of products. Planning to use this for my 5 year old daughter diagnosed with alopecia areata. Will keep you posted on results.
B00AZOTTPS|1|This are Not good you can not use them for yor nails, they will not stick. With or without glue. Another mistake buying these. i did pay enough so i am not asking for my money back i just will not purchase this again,sorry bad business.
B001EJMUPY|5|This is a heavy sturdy mirror.  It is the perfect size and I highly recommend it.  Great buy!
B008Z8VNFK|5|great product, my hair feels softer after the first use.  nice smell as well
B003XZWEE4|3|This is not the Hairagami brand even though it is listed as such. The metal inside seems to be thinner and the material outside also not as thick. It came in generic packaging and while when I ordered it said I would receive one brown and one black...I actually just got two blacks...which is ok.<br /><br />So basically, is it as good as Hairagami brand? No. Will it wear out faster? Probably. But with all that being said....you could do worse for the price and it is probably worth about what I paid for them.
B00IPOOO8C|5|This fits perfectly in my Travelon cross body bag that I use for traveling. It has so many sections and keeps everything well organized. No more shuffling around in my bag to find items. Everything has its place.
B000WSBYBY|5|It was packaged good, no scratches on it. It is quite beautiful. It was given as a Christmas gift to my daughter.
B003GDKH9C|4|I purchased these because I absolutely did not want to spend $600 on a night guard/bite splint that was offered to me at the dentist.<br />When I am stressed out I grind and clench my jaw while I sleep.<br />They're easy to pop in and they don't bother me too much while I sleep.<br />Some nights I have a harder time getting comfortable with it but this is much better than $600!
B00EV5KRTE|5|It is a very pretty purple. I get lots of complements. Makes my brown eyes pop. Very pretty. I would recommend to my friends.
B00AYCOLMC|3|I have just received the too faced no makeup makeup palette today. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. Although the product was surrounded in bubble wrap, it seems that did not help much. A chunk of the bronzing veil came out and spilled into all the creamy-consistency makeup compartments. The cheap-looking sticker around the mirror is very crinkled and messy from some excess makeup. This product was simply just too expensive to come in this sort of condition. I'm happy with the makeup itself, but disappointed in the presentation of it. Specks of powder makeup are in all the compartments. Ps in the pic I have not touched it, except to brush off the powder on the black surrounding frame. Great product, and maybe this doesn't happen to everyone and it just happened to me.
B00G8SLXQ8|5|I cut hair all the time, this is great.
B000FKHWXS|5|16 dollars goes a long way. Or whatever the price you bought it for. You only want to use a dime size otherwise your hair turns out greasy looking. So in the end it lasts a while. It smells really good, no joke. I have very voluminous hair (especially after showering)  so I just apply a dab to my hair when its still damp and then I blow dry, after I retouch by adding a little more and it turns out perfect and lasts the whole day. I highly recommend this product. Works well with dry hair too.
B004VW2HXQ|5|I am 55 and it's hard to get a blusher that looks vivid enough but still looks natural and not powdery.  I am amazed at how well this blends into my skin as if it's just my skin tone.  It takes very little to create the effect you want and it can be used all over your face to add some color.  This is the best blush I have every used.
B000NL0T1G|5|I had purchased these razors as a gift for my father, grandfather and father in law as a gift. Hands-down the best razor they have owned! Closest shaved and pennies on the dollar for the blades!! Well-balanced and the long handle is truly made for a man's hands.
B000C1Z1HE|4|I love this scent and the price is very affordable.  It's great for daytime when wearing shorts or a sundress.  My only complaint is that the scent doesn't last as long as I wish it did.
B003SZ4C1W|4|Used this on sore and calloused heels.  Seems to work fine,  deducted one star, because it broke in half as I was removing the packaging.  Assuming this isn't normal.  Still works a-ok, though.
B005VEDNO0|5|Used to add a gold shimmer hue to lip balm.  Does the job perfectly.
B004QLOFTG|5|Love it
B0012QK3HG|5|I had bought this at a local store and liked it. It was the only bottle they had and I couldn't find it anywhere else. I found a lot of other Organix products but not this so I went on Amazon to look.  Hurrah, I found it there.  I don't usually use mousse but I loved this product and use it each time I shampoo my hair. I also found an Organix conditioner that I love- pomegrante-green tea and I use it after every shampoo. As I have aged and my hair has turned gray and, believe it or not, become curly, I have had to find new products that work better than those I have been using and Organix products do the trick for me.  I think the medications I am on have had an effect on my hair also and it is a blessing that I have been able to find products that make my hair look and feel good.  Thank heavens for Organix and their different hair products.
B00012NJNC|5|I also just bought this item at Trader Joe's, and was looking around online to make sure it wasn't a discontinued item because they are great!  I got them because we live in an area with VERY hard water, which dries my skin out.  I wanted to get something that would allow me to wash my face with no water.  I've used several of the mainstream brand facial towelettes and have never liked them.  This, however, from day 1 (yesterday) has left my skin feeling soft and moist even without moisturizer for the first time since we moved here.  And I know the benefits of tea tree oil--I have used it for years for many purposes.  A couple of drops in boiling water clear up a sinus headache for me, and a drop or two diluted with a splash of water on a cotton pad clears up my skin.
B000C235E4|4|One of the very best for PE. This is truly a gentlemen in a bottle. Great for going out, or on a date.
B004LGX7XG|5|I am an elective red head. I adore that fresh from the salon color. With Tressa’s Fluid Fire, I get to keep my bold red longer. I still get some fading by the time that my next visit comes up. But that visit is now 8 to 10 weeks rather than the six weeks that I previously had to stick to. My roots show up long before my hair has faded too far.<br /><br />Fluid Fire is for crimson and brick red shades. I would recommend avoiding Fluid Fire if you have blonde highlights as too much can result in pink tones. My daughter has ombr&eacute; blonde to brick red hair. When she washed her entire head, she was left with some pink streaks. They faded out within a few days. Luckily she liked them. Now she washes just the ends on occasion to keep the brightness.<br /><br />I have not had any drying or damage to my hair or my daughter’s hair. I subscribe to the wash hair less camp. Hair washing day comes 3 times a week. I use John Frieda Riveting Reds conditioner when I wash. The daughter washes her hair every day and uses Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Conditioner.
B00F14XI6I|2|Not really happy with the quality but got what u pay! The head band is small and the pearl are not line up equally
B00ACELQQQ|5|great
B000XE0DS2|2|Thought perfume was ordered - Instead received toilette spray.  Maybe I misunderstood advertisement, but was dissappointed when received toilette instead of perfume.
B004XWR2PM|4|It makes a nice primer.  Leaves the skin feeling smooth.  It's not a dramatic difference, but it does seem to make my skin texture look smoother.
B00BHVC0DQ|1|it is too dark on my face and so it makes me look old and ugly. I have to give it to someone or throw it away. I wished I have the sample to try before I ordered this product. I have wasted, unfortunately!
B001T8OEH2|2|I really don't want to spend more than a few bucks on headbands, especially since it's so easy to lose them. I was hoping that the rubbery elastic on the underside would keep these in my hair so I could get off cheap, but they slide off pretty easily. I usually have to fix them 3-4 times during a 30 minute run on the elliptical.
B00ELSBRC2|5|This is a great product. Five stars!!!
B00DS2A6O2|1|Bathing Suit is not at is appears!!!!!!!!!!!! If you think you are getting the bathing suit in the picture you are not!  The fringes don't start until the bottom of the bathing suit.
B001QTW2FK|4|great size, lots of power, perfect size, great price, love the extras, but don't care for pink! Had no choice.
B007A59U36|5|I love it. It has soften my hair so much! I trust smooth and shine products. It is great if you straighten and dye your hair a lot. I like to put it on when my hair is dry and wear it for a couple hours until hard, and wash it out!
B00946GD7K|5|Perfect
B001FT1YPU|5|I bought this product because of my mom's recomendation. She was using and loving it. I am on the third bottle and am very pleased with too. It gives a glowing, healthy look while protecting against UV. The color kind of adapts to your skin and it is creamy. I would recomend to any skin tone.
B00C8G2VLK|5|Good quality.
B004AI97MA|5|I have used this product for several years and I believe that my age spots are less brown.
B00CS7EJQY|1|I did not like the fact that the hair feels like plastic. The wig is more expensive in other sites and I'm glad that I got it for this price because its the the quality that I wanted
B002XO4LDI|2|I have ordered numerous items from Amazon and this will be the first return. AFL Fullfillment has a good track record so I'm not sure what happened. The box and container of cream were both damaged and not sealed. The pump on the small container/bottle was also not working and I could not get a single drop of cream and both my husband and I tried. I understand that this happens and it may have just been defective, but because the box and container were not sealed, I think this was very poor service on the sellers end. There was not a single piece of paper/receipt indicating what I had ordered, which I thought was kind of weird. Frustrating to have go out of my way to find a UPS Store to return something that somebody carelessly threw in an envelope and sealed. I have small children and doing errands such as this could have been avoided if someone took an extra 5 minutes to do their job. I signed up for Amazon Prime so I could focus on more important things with my kids rather than returning items.
B0030HNNS6|5|I just started using this product, in fact I've only worn it for a week. It's the first time I have ever worn a gel eyeliner and was a little scared at first because I've tried liquid liner and hated it. I must say that I am very happy with this and dont think I'll ever go back to using the liner pencel. I made a mistake the first couple times putting it on but this stuff is so blendable, I was able to fix it with no problem. The color is amazing and the wear if fantastic. It goes on smooth and easy and you cant feel it once its on, thats one reasion I dont like the liquid. It might take you a couple trys to get it right but it's worth the time to get to know it. The brush is very soft on the sensitive skin, I wont miss the scratch of wood from not sharpening my pencel first. It's a great product, if your thinking of trying it for the first time or just looking for a diffrent brand - give it a go.
B000NCYZXI|5|Great gift item.  I gave this brush to my daughter.  She loves it.  She uses it a lot in the shower.
B004OYVYMQ|4|good
B001UE7D2I|2|This blow dryer is gold, and looks very unlike other dryers out today.  The comb attachments work great, and help you be able to pull your hair straight while blowing it out.  When it is on, it works pretty well.<br /><br />That being said, this thing shuts off continuously.  It overheats like no dryer with comb attachments that I've ever purchased before.  I thought Andis sold this dryer for a great price, but really, you're not getting at all what you are paying for.<br /><br />I would not recommend this blow dryer to anyone.  Yes, it's cute to have a gold dryer, but cute doesn't get your hair dry.
B00AKFFF2I|5|Very good.  I love it
B0002JKQ9E|3|Still working out the kinks in these for me. I have very long and very thick hair. I decided to order these based on another reviewer's post about the curlers working very well on her long hair. After blow drying, I follow the instructions to use the curlers (I use a mix of jumbo, large, and medium). And leave them in for about 20min after application. Then I blast with cool air from blow dryer and top with hair spray. After removing the curlers, I just have a small 1 or 2 ring curl on the end of my hair and hours after, my curls fall flat :/ Attempted about 5x already.<br /><br />I've always had a difficult time holding a curl, but I figured I would give this a shot with all the good reviews it had. I do like the product, especially the 'less heat' it has compared to irons or hot curlers. I'll keep trying.
B004BPVF7W|5|Great set
B000R94Q5Y|4|I love Glo's pressed foundation its perfect for oily skin. I use a foundation brush as well as kabuki, I love how flawless my face looks when im finished....but a setting spay is necessary or it will move.
B003KLVMOO|5|Good consistency.  Goes on smooth and brush defines lashes.  Does not smear
B004TMOR9K|1|Lotion was too runny I threw it away.
B00006BN44|5|You have to try this to understand how different it is.  It must be a finer grind or something, whatever it is this will be the only Talc I buy
B001S261Q6|4|it works like suppose too but not as great on very thick hair especially if you have a lot of it like I do.....
B0055S4CRY|5|quality cream fo a good price
B00HQ299W0|5|this tinted sunscreen was recommended to me by my aesthetician. she sold a box to me for about $35. I love it but didn't like the price. It smells wonderful and the tint is perfect for my skin. I use this almost everyday!
B008VHGW7Y|5|This color is absolutely fabulous! Opi nail polish is the best, would definately recommend. Got a great deal on this.
B009XHQGY0|3|Not bad, but not great either.  I tried a Super Max stainless and THAT was super sharp.
B003JM4OCG|1|to small for price and not at all like the original very disappointed to greasy and not the true color like the old one was
B00K0LUFIQ|5|Great product.  Highly recommend it
B008A1RRQQ|5|A little goes a long way.  Great for travel.  Actually works.  Living in the southwest can suck the moisture right out of your hair.  Sweat from exercise only magnifies this effect.  Try it in the salon.  Buy it on Amazon.  Thank me later.
B00D3M0CRS|5|excellent quality, excellent price, works as well as any other, and more expensive oils.  Combine with palm oil and its the best you can do for a treatment
B0000691JH|5|I have been looking for a more natural wax, and threw out my Veet wax strips because of the BHA and red dye content. I use this on my armpits, legs and bikini area.  The last 2 months I have jumped on the Brazilian band wagon.  I didn't realize how easy it was to do.  I had waxed most of my bikini area except left a little strip on each side of the lips.  I was even able to do my butt, but not without some struggle I have to admit (and I'm pretty flexible).  I don't have a microwave so I boil the jar in some water on the stove.  I'm pretty fast with my waxing so it doesn't get too sticky or cold, but the liquid-y texture makes the best results I think.  Just make sure the area is clean and dry and only put a paper-thin amount on the area.  Do small areas, not big areas.  Baby or talcum powder is great, helps the wax stick more to the hairs than the skin.  And make sure your hair is at least 1/4' in long before you wax or you're wasting your time.  I've already recommended this to a friend who never waxed.  She didn't like the pain but loved the result so she'll keep it up.
B00KVOR9VI|5|This so good I love it<br />Thank you
B000F7WVHI|5|I Like this bottle of conditioner & the shampoo of  SunSilk. Wish it was in the the stores. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for over a year. It works for my hair. I found it out of town. But I can not find here where I live or surrounding areas.
B001P97U6C|5|I have acne-prone skin. Does not clog skin. Great for sensitive skin.
B000GGHT52|5|My mother has used this product since the early '70s; now it has been discontinued for some reason. She doesn't do well with changing products. Amazon, if you can locate this product, PLEASE make it available for purchase.
B00367NWGI|4|I've been on the hunt for the basic regime that would work for my sensitive, temperamental skin. I have this unbalanced mess of sensitive, acne prone, t-zone, thus dry & oily, photosensitive (redhead) skin that hasn't been working with me very well. I discovered the Yes To line & on a whim decided I'd give them each a try. Although they are all great in their own right, the cucumbers worked best for me. I \\"uncluttered\\" by collection of various topical scrubs, creams, rx's, etc...as I've fallen prey to the notion that I had to use all of these various items to clear & balance up my delicate 30+ face. I was getting sick & tired mostly of the acne. Now it seems this line has solved my problem. I wash with either the cucumbers gel cleanser or the cucumber towelettes (which are excellent for in the gym bag or purse for midday grime, working out, camping, roadtrip, etc...). The entire line smells & works great depending on your skin needs. I will say that the smell has been an issue for some people (in regard to reviews). Smell is subjective. Personally, it's a clean cucumber scent that doesn't seem too heavy or lingering. But that's my opinion. All the products work well with one another. The Yes to Carrots is for drier skin, Cucumbers for sensitive to normal, Tomatoes for oily (which it WILL dry you out if you have severely oily skin-as I can attest. I tried Tomatoes first. A good product, but apparently I mistook acne & unbalanced for oily, when I was just provoking my sensitive skin). There is another line coming out soon, Blueberries for aging skin. As I am in my 30's I'll probably upgrade from Cucumbers to Blueberries when necessary.<br /><br />As I mentioned, they come in this & a 10 count smaller packaging. The 10 count is handy for the gym or purse, etc...I will say unless you are religious about sealing the container(s) you are best to put them into a ziplock of some kind to keep them from drying out. The wipes themselves are thicker than most brands; actually feels like a clothe. There is an abundant amount of the cleanser on it & the towelette itself is large enough to clean your face & neck. Removes makeup fairly well. I personally, with extremely sensitive skin, have not experienced any burning or irritation with this product (using them an average of once a day). I would say if they have there is something within the product itself they must be allergic to. Everyone is different.e a clothe.

B000NLJFNY|5|I received F.A.S.T. in a very timely manner and the product is great.  I use it all the time.  It does what it says.  I started using the shampoo and conditioner approximately 3 years ago.  At that time my hair was @ my shoulders.  Now my it is at my waist.  I receive compliments all the time about how healthy, shiny and long it is.
B00CAW7SD8|5|The reason I bought the 18&#34; Semi-Flex-Reach was to be able to apply sunscreen to my back.  I used it 1 weekend and did not get burned
B00517W45G|5|I've had an old Braun shaver for 15 years I think and never saw fit to replace it.  I tried several newer Brauns over the years but didn't like them.<br /><br />I must say here that I don't need to shave every day and that makes a difference with these electric shavers.  Having said that, this shaver is great.  I wish I had gotten one awhile back.  It does work in the shower and cleans easily.  The slide out trimmer works good also.<br /><br />I would recommend this shaver to anyone that likes a nice dry shave or even a wet one as I tried it in the shower with shave gel and that worked nicely as well.
B00T5FAX6M|5|Whipped Shea butter is different from other unrefined Shea butters, whipped Shea butter is creamy, soft and smooth.  My body and hair has noticed a remarkable and enjoyable difference great.
B004Q9U5CO|2|I have had several steam irons but years ago.  Th is one does not match them but works well.
B00ALV8EJW|5|Trying out this Nexxus conditioner was the first time I've used Nexxus products, and combined with the matching shampoo I found I liked them quite a bit. The conditioning is light and it doesn't weigh hair down at all. It's thicker than basic Suave conditioners, but not as dense as many Pantene conditioners. It keeps hair light and fluffy, and still keeps it smooth enough that brushing through wet hair is easy. The conditioner is white in color and has a very mild, barley-there fragrance. It's similar in scent to the shampoo that goes with it, that a citrus scent to it, with very light floral undertones. The citrus in them reminds me of the smell of lemons. Because of the way it keeps hair light and fluffy and the bright fragrance, I could see this being a great shampoo and conditioning combo for summertime. The fragrance layers well when using the matching shampoo. The two together work well to keep hair light and fluffy, and give it a wonderful scent.
B004SS6IKG|4|Nice color, gets darker after a few days wearing.
B009ASC0UQ|2|You get what you pay for. It smells good, but unfortunately it does sting and doesn't make your face feel moisturized.
B0041E4QRY|5|Arrived on time and as descibed.  Would order again when needed.  Great price also will be ordering again when needed.
B007MEOLHU|4|It's a much, MUCH thicker oil than I expected. It's almost like glycerin. It also has an odor that I'm really not thrilled about at all. It smells like a sushi restaurant in a bottle. That said, my hair LOVES it. The twist out results I've achieved since using this have been night and day. I find that sweet almond oil REALLY cuts the scent.
B004INUWX0|1|Very difficult to use; hair gets tangled up in rotating brush. I was very disappointed with this product. Could be greatly improved.
B00176JZSO|5|I picked up a sample size can of this stuff while on a trip to Germany and I loved the smell and the way it worked. I did not perspire as much and the scent of the spray remained strong enough to cover up any unpleasant underarm B.O. Before leaving Germany I bought a few full size cans to take home with me as I'd never seen this stuff for sale Stateside before. I was very glad to see that this spray is available on Amazon.com. In this reviewers opinion the smell is more appealing than Axe or other popular deodorant body sprays and it keeps odor and perspiration down to a minimum much more effectively. There are a few different scents available from Nivea and each one of them smells and works great. My girlfriend goes crazy about the smell of this stuff, too. I would recommend this stuff to any guy, unless you don't like smelling good.
B0020Z31S6|3|I just received my BB creams in the mail, however, I tested all (I bought 4) and this definitely has a grey tone.  The Skin 79 VIP Gold is medium to heavy coverage and a little dark for my skin tone (I am Caucasian with pale pink skin that tans easily). I am sure once I have some color this will be my summer BB cream, I just have to figure out how to counter the grey tones.  Once I have prolonged usage of this product I will write another review.
B00KL0HV56|5|I like your product. It's great. I'm using for face, hair mask. It's wonderfull !!!!
B00X7D48N2|1|Under magnification these tattoos look ok in ad but are really just globs of color with no feathery appearance.
B00005O0MZ|5|Good item.
B00RFX553W|5|I dont usually have much luck curling my hair with a curling iron. The curls would fall flat or would never last. I have fine, very straight, long hair, that doesn't hold a curl very well. I used this and the curls not only lasted all day, but still looked fresh the next morning. This iron gets very hot so the curls actually stay in all day, and since it rotates itself, it takes almost half the time as a traditional curling iron. It is so easy to use, and it curls my hair exactly the way I want it to. Doing the whole head took maybe 15 minutes, maybe! I am happy to recieve this awesome curling iron to review. I would (and have) highly recommend this to a friend!
B002TPQPEE|4|I would recommend buying this product. the colors are really vibrant and the case is very nice. it was exactly the way I thought it would be. The only problem is that a few of the eye shadows did get damaged in the process, but overall still worth it.
B00FS2N34U|5|I have been using sonicare for a least 10 yrs.  Had to replace old one, because battery went bad.  10+ yrs not bad.  It helps make my dentist visits better
B00HFTM980|3|Good product.
B001I90NL8|5|a traditional product in use by my family for two generations, it is great to know that it can be found in quantity through Amazon
B002KKWVX2|5|Garnier Frct Shampoo is great.  Gentle on the hair and smells great.  The 25.4 oz. bottle will last me for a very long time.
B0025VCFEQ|5|it works better than any others i have tried and the price was amazing!great shipping. i may get another one. i like how it is just the right sharpness.
B00BS9QDW6|5|This controls the fizz. End of story. Nice smell, too.
B007OT1V7Q|5|I prefer to use the nylon hair ties that are like pantyhose.  I've tried to find them at the store, but they are no longer sold there.  These are great because they are not glued together at the ends, so they don't get caught in my hair.  These are my favorite type of hair ties!
B000Q46K86|5|We have tried numerous toothpaste and this finally ended up being our favorite. Our grand kids will use it as well. My only con on this product is, I wish it came in a bigger tube, but I usually order two at a time. Try it you will love it!
B00336EUTK|4|These whitestrips really do make a difference! I'm happy with my results. Although it did make my teeth very sensitive at times. I would recommend switching to a Sensodyne toothpaste while using these to help with the extra sensitivity. Overall, I think it's a great product.
B000EGK55K|5|Works very well:  Will buy again.
B003IAPYKU|5|The bottle of Bond #9 was received on time and packed in the original manufacturers box. I would order this product again and again!!
B000G3H5TK|1|I bought this from my local market because I had ran out of the previous medication that I had, I used it and after 1 hour of it being on my face it became itchy. I look it off and the next day a huge area around the one spot that I used it on was covered in pimples. I wouldn't reccomend this product.
B0086VIA1G|5|I have a rather small mouth and this size brush is so much easier to get into and around the back teeth.
B005F79JG4|3|Nothing special.
B00O3WV85M|5|awesome!!
B00641UCY8|1|I am trying to go more days in between washing. I have 2c/b wavy hair that's color treated. Detangle??? What a joke. This thing stripped my hair so much it felt like seaweed and it became matted!! I had to use soo much of my joico conditioner... It didn't even penetrate my hair. So then I used a deep treatment mask by shea moisture... Even after 5 minutes still seaweedy! So I added some more joico and it helped a little. After I got out of the shower I had to spray, and spray, and spray, and spray, and spray.... Leave in conditioner.<br /><br />Honestly this would make a terrific clarifying shampoo... I mean I don't see how that thing is gentle at all. Might as well throw some pert on your hair and leave that in.<br /><br />I hope I can return this...
B002WZPDMG|2|I used to use Redken Blonde Glam Perfect Platinum to get the brassiness out of my hair and I was always very happy with it. The salons don't carry it anymore, and I found just small bottles at outrageous prices on Amazon, not to mention the shipping on top. So I tried this product instead. The product was not bad priced for a big bottle like that, and for the size of the bottle the shipping price was adequate. However, this product leaves my hair too golden. I don't get the nice silvery blonde out of it like with the Redken products. I give it two stars, because it leaves my hair really soft and shiny. But I will pay the extra money for Redken next time, and get the results that I want.  [[ASIN:B002H3BRX2 Redken Blonde Glam Color Enhancer Perfect Platinum Conditioning Treatment, 8.5 Ounce]]
B001KYOCI6|3|I have very normal lips. So I thought what the heck I'll get this product. I got the clear plump 100. It has a very chap stick feeling to it and I could feel that I had  put it on sec after(tingling). It did make my lower lip Bigger.<br /><br />But! the feeling dose not last long I had to apply more. Also it made my lips redder then they are and it sticks to your teeth.<br /><br />All in all  it seem to be well made I am happy to have got this.<br /><br />-Autumn
B00E9VZC4U|4|I've been using this product for the last 2 weeks so I cannot attest to long term benefits. But for the short time I've been using it, I can see that my skin is soft and supple and my hair is soft and shiny. It is not perfumed and has a mild smell which I like. One thing I like about it is the oily after effects go away immediately unlike other oils. Will update this review after using for a couple of months.
B0088K574S|1|The smell is wonderful and it doesn't leave a sticky feeling. But I was using this at a family reunion and the more I used, the more bugs were flying around my head. We tested it and put some on my husband. He quickly became a bug magnet. I don't like chemicals, but this is one natural solution that simply doesn't work. :(
B00Q2MYYSE|5|This lotion is exactly what I needed. It helps with dry skin and lasts all day. I love it.
B0010VLJ58|5|Love it
B0042APDU6|5|I use all these tools every day and it is so amazing being able to use them and turn them off having somewhere to put them that I am not afraid will burn my house down!
B00A6VN56E|5|Love both the shampoo and conditioner. I use both of them daily! I would highly recommend them as they are both the price they charge.
B00DF6KPUG|5|Love it. No flakes where others fail me
B002TMXV62|5|It's a must have to keep skin clear and fresh.  I've ordered this for many years and it works great every time I order!
B00BAZ39JI|5|the Tweezer is very versatile and works perfectly.
B00NH1EUFA|4|Very close, just not as strong. You just need to apply often.
B00TSSY2KO|5|I am sure by other reviews about the product; I will be happy. I have not had the time to set up the new machine that I also purchased; by Salon Edge.<br />I also bought the cleaner liquid to use at the same time as others have recommended.<br />I can hardly wait to use the machine. It is not a walmart special!!<br />All three products work together.<br />I believe that men and women will find it enjoyable. I believe you could also introduce your favorite scent to the machine as an additional option.<br />I hope this inspires you to look at the other complementing products in your purchase decisions.
B009U9YGB6|1|I was so excited when I got these. They came in the cutest little box. But, to my dismay, they weren't really curved in the box, which made them difficult to put on. They lashes weren't the same length as their mate. Once I stepped outside,  my allergies flaired.  As soon as my eyes began to water, the lashes came right off. They do not stick well and the slightest drop of water makes them slide. In addition,  the lashes were not made for people with tiny  eyes.
B001MW38U4|1|This is the last time I buy discontinued products. The box came in dusty and dented like it was fetched out of an attic. The actual lip color was pretty nasty. It cakes your lips and smells like nail polish. It may not come off when you eat, but it'll chip off like eraser shavings when you wipe your lips or apply the moisturizer it comes with. Also, if you have a small mouth like me, your teeth will catch all the color towards the back of your lips. Never Again!
B00JH3KAKQ|4|Purchased theSe brushes for my Mia. The brushes  are nice and full. They are soft enough to use 9 face. I am very pleased with them and will be buying more to have on hand.
B00HE67BC8|5|Ok... usually I don't write a review immediately upon receiving a product unless there is something seriously wrong, but in this case I'm making an exception (and will likely follow up in a few weeks). I'm still waiting on my oils to arrive, but decided to plug this in and give it a go. Just like some of the other reviewers said, this immediately started putting out mist! The instructions are simple, set up took less than 5 minutes, and it operates super quiet.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />This diffuser is working great! I'm using Eden's Garden Essential Oils (usually I don't mention other products in a review but these are really good). I have had it on every night and have had not issues with the mist, fragrance (I use 4-6 drops), or the auto turn off. It appears that the water lasts about 6 hours and the oils are diffused evenly the entire time. The mist can feel a bit cool if you are really close to it. When the water reservoir gets low you will sometimes here the water (kind of like a very soft sounding ornamental fountain)
B003B2QCK6|5|Arrived on time. Packaged nicely no issues there. As far as the pruduct goes....LOVE THE COLOR!!!  I have very ethnic hair so it's hard at times for me to find products that wont kill my hair. This product smells wonderful and left my hair soft! Lasts long (i do use the color treAtment shampoo and conditioner). I will definitely be purchasing this color again!
B001ET7HZM|4|Ive purchased Earth Therapeutics products before, and have been satisfied.  I particularly like this brush because of the one-piece handle.  There is no wood to crack, so I am expecting a long life from this product.  The bristle stiffness is about right for my comfort.
B00J5N0Y4U|5|The serum is very moisturizing. It doesn't clog my pores and it's very light on my skin.
B000Q5NK92|5|Bought this for my 6 year old niece. Oh boy! All little girls love Hannah! heehe.  Dress-up is always fun!
B00BGAM0FG|5|I love this product.  Works great with short hair.  A little goes a long ways, with the flexible hold and body.
B0019M3IIE|4|Have used for a long time. Applied properly it is effective and light.<br />Hard to find, but this one will last me for years the way I use it .
B0030U1JZ2|5|best lotion ever!
B007ROD09K|1|When I received my first order of this product, I was shocked at the poor quality.  There were black scratches all over it and finger smudges.  It seemed like it had been used before, there is no way it was new.  Then, when I plugged it in, it gave off a terrible smell.  I figured this was just a fluke and returned it thinking they would send me a new one.  I was disappointed when the next one I got also seemed used.  I gave up and have kept it but even after 6 months, my towels have a bad smell to them after warming them up in this.
B008U12YV4|3|Nothing to write home about.
B00BIFWYTG|5|Ok
B000I0VDDK|5|A++++++++
B00EMHZWNM|5|I initially received this shampoo and conditioner as a prize in a blog giveaway. I had never heard of it before, but when I tried it I knew that I had to find out where to buy it.  I have extremely long hair and have always had difficulty finding quality products that are suitable for my hair.  I noticed a bid difference right away after using these.  My hair has never been as soft or as shiny as it is now. I had to make sure I bought more before my first bottles ran out.  I feel confident that I won't use any other shampoo and conditioner again. Oh, it smells really nice too.
B0013F8JXG|5|I'm sure my son will enjoy
B006ZZSL2S|5|Works great! Tried it at a kiosk at the mall and they wanted $100 more then here on Amazon. Works Great even after using everyday for a yr.
B003Z4QHP0|4|Good quality
B002ZNJI3K|3|The hair don't color, eeerrrr!!!, the hair sheds a lot, everytime u comb or maybe pull ur hands through, maybe not be much all the time but this is a manikin, it doesn't grow back, shouldn't be shedding so much!!!
B000CER3TU|4|I have And old ONE i DONT buy my new one yet but for cut hair is good I have a problem only when I try to fade from cero up a little adjustment for that problem may need it
B0014P8L9W|5|This will last me a good while. Thank you!
B000ETJ3WI|5|dad loves it, hard to find in stores,younger generation say what's that.
B00LGZ2E0W|5|Love this bronzer!!!!!
B000VWL9IO|1|Obviously very old inventory.  In one bottle, it has separated into clumps of goo.  Had to throw that bottle away. Second bottle not separated but smell and texture not consistent with the excellent product I have used for years.
B000V9EDV2|1|I use Bare minerals for 3 years now, I really love it. I was thinking that was a really good deal on Amazon, but I can tell that is not the real bare minerals!<br />Bad coverage, even I try to put more on my face, the result is not uniform at all and looks like I don't have any make up on my face. I am very disappointed. I don't recommend to buy it.
B003QLM12A|5|Bought this straighten for my girlfriend she completely loves it, as well as the added crimper basically two hair styler products in one and the price was even more amazing.
B001RPL902|5|Instead of getting burned with wax, this is an amazing little thing.<br />Very useful since it is small, so I can take it to travel.<br />Very happy that I found it.<br />Wife
B003GDKMVK|5|This brush is soft, dense and well-built.  I like to use it to apply concealer on my undereye areas but it doubles as a good eye shadow blending brush as well.
B0020MM8WO|5|Best stuff I've ever used period.  And I don't know the first thing about Raymond Usher  but this cologne is by far the best I've ever tried.
B001NW7QM4|1|This scent smells nasty and nothing like the real deal. I bought 2 colognes from this seller I pretty much got ripped off with this counterfeit bottle. Are all your bottles expired? Might as well go to Macy's and pay that extra dollar but know that you're getting real stuff plus at least at Macy's you can return it here at Amazon you're screwed $70 down the drainwith the 2 bottles I bought. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! Fake nasty scent
B00E7HBZSI|5|If you have fine slippery sleek hair and you want texture and volume, this is your ticket!  However, its is a clay type product which reduces shine.  Best for root boost. I've ordered a couple.
B00A6KN146|5|Great product...kids will only use this brand. cheapest on Amazon!
B00I5X93YS|5|I have been using this spray for the past seven years, and I think it is amazing.  You can definitely feel that it is having a wonderful cleansing effect on your energy field.  It evidently has the right combination of essential oils to get the job done.  I recommend it to everyone.  Don't hesitate to buy it.
B002N5MHLK|5|It Shaves very quickly and clean.<br />unlike the former two blades I used, four blades cover your face tightly. it wont leave one beard.<br /><br />The shipment speed need to be quickened,
B0050ZJ4PC|2|I used to use this fragrance when I was younger. I literally loved it and sprayed it on everything!<br />I just fell that this is a different scent, or it was just sitting around for a long time.<br />It wasn't terrible.... But it wasn't the same as what I remember and it sure wasn't the scent I was expecting.<br />But it was alright.
B00B4VIM86|5|The cream cheek color works so much better than dry blush for me.
B0006GZAKI|5|I have had trouble with both dandruff and rosacea as I've gotten older, and I came to realize that harsher shampoos aggravated both conditions significantly. Products containing alcohol in particular were my personal trigger.<br /><br />I ordered this based on Amazon reviews and I was not disappointed. It cleans well but gently. It has a pleasant, light floral scent. Most importantly, when I use it I have little to no troble with dandruff and my skin doesn't flare up like it did with other products.<br /><br />For anyone who has never tried a sulfate free shampoo, it is extremely low lathering, it takes some getting used to, but that is normal. I use the conditioner as well, and I like it. My hair is straight, about normal texture and dryness, no special needs like curls.<br /><br />I'm buying a bottle of the Camellia scent to try it but I would recommend this product based on my experience.
B00LU1V3JK|5|I'm not a &#34;product person&#34; but I decided to give this a try when I was given an offer to try it at a substantial discount to review and test it....and I LOVE it... I have puffy eyes with dark circles and within a few days my eyes are already looking better... Definitely worth the full price.... thank you!
B004QBIMB8|5|Good quality
B00A3C3N5O|5|The stamper Iis great!!!! It arrived before the expected date. The plates are good quality and very varied designs. The stamp is easy to do and clean.
B0009P4PZC|5|Great product and a lot for the price
B006W2SYGM|5|Great razor, not sure if the cleaning station is worth it. Cleans up fine with a quick rinse of water, have not used the<br />cleaning station yet.
B001W7GO1O|3|The product worked well, but IMO the applicator is a very poor design.  You need to be very careful that the dye does not drip off of the applicator and perhaps end up in your eye.  I was careful; no problem, but it is a poor design.  I will research the other root touch up products to see what they use.
B009IQJTTA|5|really good and convenient to use. no problem thanks.
B004T3K54U|3|Not sure if I like this product all that much. I didn't like that I had to put it on my eye lashes versus on my lash line. Didn't put it on consistently enough to see if it works.
B0049LUI9O|5|This is a no frills, easy to use way to just get rid of nose hair. You put in the batteries, and your good to go. Just put it in your nose, hit the button and in 15 seconds your done.<br /><br />This really doesn't do much for any other spots like your ears or eyebrows, unless you are planning on spending a long time feeding hairs in one by one.<br /><br />Overall it's awesome at the low price point. I have a spare in the glove box since it's so small and I tend to grow nose hair faster than I do on my head. If only it would fall out of my nose too!!<br /><br />Give this a shot. Don't waste your money on some overpriced tool. This is all you need.
B000NMH512|4|Weird at first.  Great later
B0050QJHTO|5|i absolutely love this i actually have a twitter reviewing beauty products, its @beautyreviews10 . anyways i recommended this product to my followers! beautiful curls, more like waves but im sure i just have to get the hang of it to make curls! so many styles of waves/curls you can do with it. it leaves a shiny finish to your hair and i didnt even use hair spray and almost 10 hours later i still have wave. ive even been laying on it for hours while on my laptop. i highly recommend. one of the best hair stylers i have ever used. and trust me, i have used ALOT! although mine sis not come in its original packaging. i suspect its not new but i wiped it down with disinfectant and im sure its fine. love!DOES NOT COME WITH THE HEAT PROTECTANT GLOVE THOUGH. i was alittle disapointed about that.
B000GAXILM|5|This is, in my opinion, the best hand lotion on the market. What catapults it into the top for me are several things: it does not have a greasy feel to it; it is not just unscented but actually fragrance free meaning no scent whatsoever; it immediately soothes and refreshes dry skin, even excessively dry skin; and it lasts. It may not have a fancy name, but it it is the best at what it does. I give this my highest recommendation.
B008TBTAAI|1|I was advertised as 100% Japanese steel. Totally not what was delivered. Made in Pakistan.
B001GQ3GEY|5|Husband loves it!
B003FSGRW4|1|I was patient with this product. I used it for 3 mnths. NOTHING. A waste of money.
B00GW4OVF8|5|Brushes are soft. Little to no shedding.  The carry case/tube can fit more brushes (like small eye detail brushes). Also the little face towels the set comes with are very nice and they also have very little shedding to none.
B005G9E9AW|3|Its a good creamy eyeliner but it likes to break off when u apply it.
B00398EDTE|5|One of the items on my daughter's Christmas list was Britney Spear's Midnight Fantasy.  I had a hard time finding the gift set in my local area, so I went to Amazon and found it.  The price was right in line with what other products of this type were selling locally, it qualified for free shipping, and it arrived with plenty of time to spare.  On Christmas morning I was a \\"hero\\" as she received the gift she wanted.  I was extremely pleased with this seller.
B000J14PR4|3|This will crush pills but depending on how hard the pills are, it can be really difficult to turn the handle enough times.  And even if you try opening and closing it multiple times (which does seem to help) sometimes it gets stuck in the closed position.  I consider myself fairly strong, but am often asking my husband for help to open it back up...  I will look for another version that doesn't rely on my strength to crush the pill.
B00C7DYBX0|2|I am on my 3rd bottle of the hyaluronic acid and was really hoping to see some improvement in the overall appearance of my skin but I honestly do not see any difference.  I used it faithfully every night and applied moisturizer immediately afterwards .  I was really hoping to notice even a slight improvement but i will not purchase this item again.
B00KGKQR2Y|4|I love it. I have very sensitive skin ans this does not irritate my face and leaves it soo clean!
B000KHIQ1I|5|I love this lotion and I higly recomend it if you like fresh citrus fragances.
B0022H6JQI|5|This stuff has totally revitalized my dry, brittle, color-treated hair. It is worth every penny.  I've tried countless argan oil treatments to try to find a more affordable alternative and have never been successful in finding anything that works as well for me as this product.
B001ECQ7G4|5|been using this product for years. It works best for preventing and treating razor burn
B003AYEGAI|5|My kids and I love using this Herbal Essence product. We have been having trouble finding it in the local stores so we were thrilled to find it here.
B002N5MHLU|5|Having used a Norelco shaver for more than 45 years, following the example set by my father,  I never anticipated switching brands.  Typically, I got a good shave from the Norelco's and they were solid and long lasting.  I got a new Norelco a little over a year ago, replacing one more than 10 yrs old, and was disappointed with the shave, the lack of power and the light, cheap feel the new Norelco had in my hand.   When I saw the Gold Box sale combined with a rebate on the Panasonic ES-LA63 and the high level of reviews,  I decided to give it a try.   I can say without reservation that it is giving me the best shave I have ever had,  has plenty of power and I'm enjoying that I can shave in the shower.   I'm still on the first charge so I can't comment on time between charges or battery reliability.    Highly recommended so far !!
B00NPD0ZUE|5|When I saw this flavor i was intrigued enough to buy, it really does smell as delicious as it sounds. Would definitely recommend it.
B00194FV5U|5|love this oil
B00DPVH8CE|4|I think that it is great quality.... granted I have not worn it other than to quickly test it out, as I will be mailing it to a friend in another state... but I do wish they were a little shorter.... I do intend to buy myself some in different colors, but will pick TOP colors I like, because I have to trim them down.... which will cut a lot of the bottom color off. I do not wish to look like I have a mullet! LoL<br /><br />The product is SUPER soft to the touch... I had no problem running my brush through it.<br /><br />Yes, strands will brush and pull out... but that is normal for any hair piece... they are enhancers, not miracle workers.  This is why I brush the hell out of hair pieces before I wear them anyways.  Then I just trim up very uneven areas... this piece IS thick enough to spare some strands.  They are also very fine strands... do not feel plasticy or fake at ALL. :)<br /><br />Someone else said they were too shiny... I saw them to be no shinier than healthy natural hair.<br /><br />I do not recommend for people with shorter hair or thin hair.  I myself have thinner hair and so, even when I tease my hair, the weight of this piece pulls enough that my hair won't support the clips along the edges.
B001GNBW0W|5|i love this mascara and was amazed i could still buy it overseas,, thank you amazon,,
B00UFDHT06|5|Sent a great email with uses for the Clay.<br />Very informative and handy<br />would love to buy from them again!
B000HRVC5I|5|I bought this over a YEAR ago and I am finally needing to get a replacement. I never imagined it would last me this long and am beyond happy with this product! I use it all the time and never will go back to regular crappy makeup sponges again - it truly does give you an airbrush finish and I love how soft and durable it is! I wash mine out with plain ol' hand soap and water before each use, (which is great because I'm not pressing nasty bacteria into my face) and I've found that I get the best results when I use it slightly damp. I dab my liquid foundation onto the sponge and with a dotting motion stipple it onto my face, with a slight press and turn. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and recommend it to everyone!
B005CX4KGA|3|It's okay I like thicker shampoo!
B006UV3OWO|5|I love the consistency.  Not sticky at all.  The color is sheer and beautiful.  So sad this isn't part of their regular line. Love it so much that I bought a couple!
B00185EA8E|4|Being a red head is a lot of work! If you don't have the patience, time, or money for up keep, then choose an easier color to work with! If you put up with all of what was mentioned above to be a sassy red head, then using a color depositing shampoo will help you out!<br /><br />I am naturally a brunette, but have been a red head off and on for years. I only recently found out about color depositing shampoos from my hair dresser, and man I have to say that I wish I knew about them sooner! Now when I get my hair done I always go for a bright and vibrant red. I know out of all the redish choices I could choose from that choosing a more vibrant one is harder to keep up with, but I say go big or go home!<br /><br />So with my vibrant red hair, this shampoo has definitely helped keep my hair noticeably more vibrant than if I had used my normal color protecting shampoos.<br /><br />I saw in some reviews that people wrote that they didn't like how the color gets all over the shower. I don't think this would happen from just this partiualr color deposiiting shampoo, but I've tried another one and it happens as well with the other product. After I first used the shampoo, I realized I just had to be mindful of how I was my hair from now on. I couldn't just go crazy and lather away like normal. This makes sense since after all your washing your hair with hair dye! Now I purposefully wash it and am really careful and nothing turns pink!
B00CBYAK26|1|Ordered product  within the week fell apart company wont repond back
B000BHKBGK|5|I had been using Squigle for a few months and loved it. I ran out and used something else for a while and my gums became inflamed on one side of my mouth. After a few days of using Squigle again, my gums were doing much better. It has a mild taste and my children love it.
B00KQASCDG|5|I love this!! Perfect for making body butter!
B009XY1SKK|5|Pays for itself over time.  Have used the DriBlade for 8 months to care for my Harry's cartridge razor.Works exactly as advertised in all respects. Excellent value for the money. I do an extra step in preserving the sharpness of the blades and reducing corrosion: After rinsing the cartridge thoroughly with a forceful flow of water, I blow through the cartridge from back to front to blast out any remaining water; then dab (don't stroke) the cartridge face on a dry towel. With this step, and the DriBlade, my Harry's cartridges last quite awhile--many more shaves than the Gilette Fusion Pro-Glide cartridges that I used to have.
B003V265QW|5|This wand is amazing. I have never used a wand before, but figured it would be pretty easy. I like both large and small curls and it's easy to get a medium curl and ringlets with this wand. It heats up super fast and stays hot. Some people have said the buttons are easy to accidentally push? You can lock the buttons by holding the &#34;-&#34; button and unlock the same way. A little padlock shows up on the digital screen. Remember that the glove is Not supposed to be used to Hold the wand, it's a protection against grazes and accidental touches. This wand is worth the buy. It's super cheap and easy to use. Just remember to experiment with heats. People's hair reacts differently to different heat. 400 is almost certainly too hot for your hair. I comfortably use around 330, sometimes less if I have more time in the morning. Oh! And remember to experiment with the time your hair is around the wand. Some times will work better than others but you don't want your hair on a high-heat object for longer than it needs to be. Just be patient because this wand is super versatile with hair types. I think wands are BEST suited for someone who wants something to redefine their natural curls BUT it works amazing for my plain wavy hair. Don't hesitate!
B00OYEXE1U|5|THIS IS A WONDERFUL &#34;TRIO&#34;  my face & neck feel clean AND TIGHTER...have been using these for 3 mths now along with a good supply of organic aloe and a natural &#34;tan physics&#34; indoor tanning lotion and have many compliments on my colour and clarity of my young looking face for my age. (68}..I highly recommend these magnificent three...I would get a little extra of the retinol when ordered...its very easy to use a little too much at times of this and the retinol gets used ahead of the other two.
B00DGGG1IU|3|the colors are not the same as the picture
B001FB5HYC|5|good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)
B00502NMTE|5|I love adding this light oil to my regular day and night cream. I live in Colorado and it is so dry here this product really helps. The smell is a little like vit. E oil and maybe something else but, I don't care.
B000C1VYBG|5|I like it
B000EYTEAY|3|I must be doing something wrong but its not a science the places where you wear this oil, and the fact you can use it alone, with your favorite  perfume or in a bath. But i did my research and i follow all the instructions... people are the same nice to me and i see no change, like someone approaching me like unusual. Not sure.
B005SW10YA|5|No more tangled mess under my chin!!!  The 50' hose is no longer a kinked up mess!!!  I am very happy with this purchase!!!  This swivel has made life a bit easier for me....that's what it's all about!!
B0069SQFSI|5|I use this when making my own cleaning products.  Lemon works for so many things around the home and is natural
B002Y26V5K|4|The title says it all.  The kid loves it, the smell is pleasant, and it's a quick all-in-one go to.
B005FLT37K|5|This curling iron is the perfect size for me.  One inch is a little big, so I thought I would order this size and it works perfect for my hair. Finally the right size, it is not to big, not to small.....it is just right!
B009SPD1PY|5|These three items were wrapped so securely, there was no chance they would spill. There's a fresh, healthy scent, and a cool, invigorating feel that leaves your scalp and skin fresh. It's a bit less sudsy than many other shampoos, but that's a good indication that the produce is free of unhealthy chemicals that strip your hair and can be hazardous to your health. A real beauty product that's cruelty free - and a great price, too!
B003ATS2QC|4|The scale requires you to be perfectly still while it weighs you. I must get use to it.They do instruct you to hold on to the wall if you have trouble staying still.
B00BG4418Q|5|Best stuff ever!  Makes your skin baby-butt smooth~!
B0009QZYBU|5|Leaves my 4b/c natural hair very soft and manageable.  I apply a little everyday and there's no build up.  I get super soft manageable hair.
B007P70UEW|5|Everyone wonders 'what's in the air' when I ready my place with this scent, most times combined with lavender.  Oh my....place this in your heated candle lit diffuser, and it's ON!  It's so-o-o relaxing, and it makes you want to take a few deep breaths - before you move on with your day.  Don't pour too much, or it feels a bit medicinal....but if your sinuses need opening (a few drops in warmed water) - and you have a much softer scent experience than peppermint (which if often overwhelming).
B000E7WHLY|5|excelente producto
B00P84VDRC|5|Thx - quick shipper - great products.
B00480FHA6|1|PRODUCT WAS SO OLD THAT IT HAD CONGEALED INTO A RUBBER-LIKE SUBSTANCE. I COULD NOT GET IT ONTO THE APPLICATION BRUSH
B00H4F6MPQ|5|Great hair extensions they are super soft, long and look like actual human hair the color looks the same as the picture they do seem to tangle a bit but great for the price I will def buy from them again :)
B00A839O1U|3|Cost to much!
B008YQM4A6|5|This is my favorite mouthwash. I actually really enjoy the burn, because I feel like my mouth isn't getting as clean otherwise, and it tastes really good. I had no problem with my taste buds afterwards. Actually does whiten your teeth, as well. It's honestly not that bad a burn. I had gingivitis when I started using this, and now I don't, and I didn't change the type of toothpaste I was using.
B002YY3RT6|4|I've used Biore pore strips before and loved them. I didn't use it frequently though- maybe once every month or so. But I just tried to put one on and I couldn't really find anything related to it-- I wonder if it's just me? After I put it on, my nose felt like it was on fire. The strip hadn't dried yet but it felt like I was being burned, so I took the strip off. Anyone else feel this before? ... Maybe I just had a faulty strip...? I don't know. I like the product, but I think I won't be using it for a while, just to be on the safer side, haha.
B001KYQ1B2|5|I wore this for the first time today and even though I did not buy it through Amazon I wanted to leave a review to give the product the praise it deserves! This tinted moisturizer will be a staple item in my beauty/makeup routine from now on. I do not need heavy coverage and have combination skin that can become very oily with some products but also gets dry to the point that it peels in some areas. After all day of having this on the slight redness in my forehead and cheeks is still covered and my complexion looks completely even AND my face does not look oily at all!
B003ZWEW1S|4|You will have to buy extra paraffin for it, but otherwise we like it alot.  The only complaint we have is that the instructions say that it takes an hour to melt.  It actually takes 2-3 hours to melt.  But otherwise this is a great product .And the included hand mitts are a super addition.
B00K7OQNDM|3|I was hoping for a product that lasted all day but this one does not.
B000FEGUIW|4|The product is Great! However, I would DHL delivery service as very poor. To their credit Amazon refunded my three day delivery charge. Next time I hope they ship via UPS!    Thank you,  Charles P Kopera
B00KGO8XY0|2|Was a little disappointed because it clumped my eyelashes and made them look bulky instead of long.
B003U7OYK2|5|Love it, does not irritate my skin.  It's hard to pick anti-aging products with so many choices out there. Knowing that mixing different products can make them ineffective, I like the Olay collection approach, which is a group of products that all work together. In my case it's the Regnerist collection, for us 50+ girls.  So far, all I've tried are good and will continue to use.  The value and service at Amazon makes it more affordable, and I love the ease of Subscribe and Save ordering.
B00YU4MSSY|5|This review is for:<br />Best Bath Brush with Natural Bristles presented by Reng&ouml;ra - Premium Wooden Shower Brush - for Soothing Skin Cleansing, Dry Brushing, & Gentle Exfoliating - Upgrade Your Wet / Dry Body Brush Today!<br /><br />So far I'm really liking this brush. My old loofah was hard and felt too rough on my skin. The bristles on this brush are firm enough to get me nice and clean, but not so tough that it takes off 3 layers of skin in the process. I have some minor mobility issues, and it makes it much easier to reach my back. The handle is a bit slick, but it has a rubber grip at the end that gives you a good place to hang on to it.<br /><br />At first, it's difficult to separate the brush from the handle. What you need to do is firmly grip the brush and wiggle it back and forth a bit until it loosens up and comes off. It's a great tool. It lathers up a lot more than I expected it to. I've noticed a couple bristles came loose, but that was just the first time using it, I haven't noticed any since then. If you're looking for a good body brush or if you have mobility issues and have a hard time reaching everything to clean, I'd definitely recommend this one.<br />I received this brush free or discounted in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. All opinions and experiences are 100% my own.
B00005CDSP|4|This works pretty well, but I haven't used it very much at all because I don't have very long hair.
B003EH23N8|5|This product is absolutely AMAZING!  If there was some kind of freaky law that allowed everybody to have only one hair product, I'd choose Pantene Pro-V Relaxed and Natural for Women of Color. ENOUGH SAID.
B000G1785S|4|First of all, it shaves very well -- not QUITE blade close, but it doesn't me bleed or irritate my skin, either.  I like the cleaner.  The trimmer can handle the longer hairs that can get away from an electric; no problems around my chin and nose (where some electrics don't get it done).  High grades!
B000143C0K|5|great no problems!!!!!
B00BNP2APY|5|I've been using this gel for a couple of years and love it. Despite coming from such a far place the delivery was not that long.
B004VR808M|4|Love the tree hut lotion, it is light fragrance and is nice and silky feeling.  The RS moisturizer is for my son as he likes the RS products.
B001H96994|5|This is the only product I have found that actually covers. It is very easy to use and I love it. Can't be found in stores in our area so I really was thrilled to be able to find it. Shipped very fast and was packaged so it wouldn't break.
B00CCYRB8Q|5|Pretty!! Got lots of compliments on them!!
B000050AP3|5|This product is extremely easy to use, fill and clean.  The water tank on the back has a sturdy handle and pulls right up.  The tank is completely sealed, so after filling it you can carry it back without risk of spilling anything.  It holds enough water for a day or two, which is nice.  The filter is easy to change - lift up the front housing and drop it in.  The motor is quiet - not silent, but it is in the bedroom and we sleep fine.  Dialing a particular humidity is great.  It turns itself on and off to maintain that level - you just dial and leave it alone.  It keeps our 10x18 bedroom at 50% no matter the weather.  Much better than other humidifiers I've used.    October 2004:  Replacment Tank.  I would like to add that recently, I knocked the water tank against the sink - fairly hard (I slipped) - and the bottom corner of the tank cracked, and was leaking.  One call to Hamilton Beach and a new one was on its way, free of charge.  Now *that* is customer service.    November 2005:  Repurchase.  After five years, the old unit was gunked up on the inside beyond cleaning.  The instructions say to store it, \\"completely dry, sealed and in its original box\\", when not used for over two weeks.  I never bothered (who has time for all that?), so it was out in the room permanently for 5 years.  Of course, it collected dust and grime on the fan blades and inside the housing.  It was not possible to disassemble the unit for cleaning - I tried but it looks like once put together, it was never meant to be taken apart by anyone, not even a technician.  With such high-maintenance storage instructions, many owners will have units that stay out and get grimy inside.  They really should make it easy to thoroughly clean all of the internal parts.    That said, I purchased another of these units.  The new one came with a tank made of a different kind of plastic - slightly more rubbery and not so stiff.  Perhaps the old, harder plastic cracked too easily or something.  The new tank isok, but one time after filling it up, the plug came out and I had to sop up a couple of gallons of water off my bedroom floor.  I kept the old, hard tank from the old unit and am using that now.  It works fine.
B000ARWLIM|4|Very good magnification, but reflections blur when mirror is angled. The stand is convenient for free hand zit popping. The light is as bright as a firefly however. I suppose if you needed to illuminate AND magnify something deep in a dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and only had this mirror with batteries installed, you may actually have praise for the light feature. Of course, if you happened to be lost in that deep dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and wanted the light of the mirror to actually help you illuminate anything other than your nose, you would be as disappointed with the light as at almost any other time. Save your batteries. Regardless and overall, it is a good mirror.
B004752C4Q|4|accurate fragrance
B00BDGSOL2|3|Eyes itched as soon as I used it. Will give it a chance. Could be operator error =D Staying positive for great results.
B0061JPJ28|2|I bought this originally for the 48 hour claim, and boy does it deliver. Unfortunately, a week or two into using the first stick I began to develop a painful rash under both arms. I have never experienced sensitivity to deodorant in the past and thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tried another stick after some time for the rash to go away. Same results.<br /><br />I may try another one of the Dove 48 hour deodorants, but this one is looking dead in the water to me.
B000Y1DTRG|5|No issues. Product showed up as described
B0016D4RQS|4|Best incense out there! Long lasting fragrance and great variety of scents. Stays fresh longer then some other brands. Burn it in every room in the house!!
B001MV5Y20|4|I bought this product at Walmart for fifteen dollars!! It is a great product but if you buy it here you are paying too much. Actually helps with my acne by absorbing oil throughout the day. I saw a bunch of posts about the product being lighter than expected but I actually found this a little dark for my skin tone. I'm really pale though (natural ginger with freckles and everything). It is worth the splurge if you want to buy the products separately for a different color. I was pleasantly surprised by the coverage that it provided.
B000TBXPLG|1|I recieved two bottles of this product today. After opening them I discovered that one bottle was a very very light green (so light that it cant really be called green) & the other bottle, which was half empty,  was a darker seafoam green. Both products smell same, so the difference may simply be a change in formulation by the manufacturer or one could be old. Either way, there's no logical explanation for one bottle being half empty, and I am hesitant to use either bottle as I am unsure if they may have been tampered with, as there weren't any safety seals.
B003FBTW7I|5|The price is at a discount. The shipping is fast  It is good to have a spare.  This is my regular brand
B00CNWY1YY|5|I wanted something like this that I could mix with whatever product I chose. I mix it with Jojoba oil and love the way it makes my skin feel. It will last a long time because you don't have to use much at all. Other products that have these crystals are way too expensive.
B008R799G4|5|Easy to use and does the job!
B000068PBT|5|good blades, fitted fine, very sharp.  you can depend on<br />Norleco. Excellent product.<br />will definitely buy again thru Amazon.  like straight from<br />the factory/
B0057JCYYE|5|Great kit, cheaper priced than most beauty supply stores.
B00AVQ0LY8|5|I had purchased this for my husband an d he loved it.  It reminded him of the past, great memories
B004ZBMTPY|2|First off, let me preface this by saying that I have a moderate beard. I need to shave daily but it I would not consider it heavy by any means.  As far as shaving, it does that job for me and meets my needs. I expect the titanium blades to work for the duration of the razor (as was the case in my previous Remington rotaries that last 6 years and were disposed of only because the batteries died). But this purchase left me thinking I should have replaced the batteries on the previous razor and dealt with the diminished aesthetics.  The problems I have with this razor are:  1) The floating head assembly is annoying. It's constantly clicking as it moves with the contours of my face.  2) The razor is very light and seems very cleaply made. The fissures where the parts connect are rough and do not fit well.  3) It did not come with a protective plastic head nor with a pouch/bag.  4) It didn't even come with a small cleaning brush.  5) The converter is on the cord and not in the razor. I'd rather have it built-in as in every other cordless Remington I've owned.  Look, it does the job and I paid only $45 with shipping for it. But the construction and design leave much to be desired. I cannot recommend this and wish I would have bought it locally so that it could have been returned more easily.  It seems that manufacturers are building their products more and more cheaply, leaving out the incidentals that always made a purchase a bit more palatable.
B00B9JTITK|4|This is working VERY well for my daughter's eczema - smoothing out the rough spots and blending nicely.  Definitely worth a shot if you're struggling.
B009H6S2NU|1|Purchased this for a friend of mine.  The wax does not get hot enought, it was extremely messy to use.
B001KYRVSO|4|Like mo3pal said, these are a bit small especially if you wear them around your wrists. I have very thin wrists but they still start to cut off my circulation if I have more than one around my wrist.<br />Nice colors (marroon, dark brown, light brown, black, army green, cream/white)--I gave the white ones to a blonde friend because I have very dark hair and they don't work well with my hair, but all the other colors are great with by black brown hair.<br />I haven't had these long enough to comment on their durability, although in all honesty they look like what you're paying for. not really high quality, but they'll do.
B0033EUIO8|1|The pictures, etc, make it seem that this item is a fairly large clipper which could be used for toe nails.  Actually, it is just the same as the cheap small ones that you can get in any drug store........with a little plastic&#34; jacket&#34; on it.  It's actually worse then the drugstore ones because the &#34;jacket&#34; gets in the way.  Don't buy this you can get the same thing in a drug store for a buck.<br />Jim w
B008LOI2X4|3|Cocobutter is raw and unrefined. At room temperature it is pretty solid and holds up well to fluxuating room temperatures. I bought this to mix with othwr butters and oils for a home made hair and body butter. Once melted and whipped into a creamy butter with the other oils i noted that the butter's scent was very strong and overshadowed the natural scent of shea and mango butters. Price for the quanity recived is well. Packaging was off though. Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The second photo is my mixed butters that I've included coco butter in.  The ones that have a yellowish tone are the ones containg coco butter.
B008Z0SCM0|5|Everything Alterna produces is usually a great product and you don't have to worry about if it gets the job done like it says and this treatment is no different.  Another A+ for Alterna!!
B0019SRJ3S|1|I would not recommend this to anyone. It feels greasy and smells horrible. I stuck with it for two weeks and had no results.
B00JTLZZCO|5|smells fantastic--does the job well
B001ABLKK2|5|It is useful as it described.
B009DU4QYE|5|This is a great product from this new company. The shampoo works great on everyone in my family who has oily hair. Our hair is now less oily and this shampoo has proven to work. We use it every day and it has decreased oil levels in the hair and it has strengthened the hair. We like it also because it is an all natural product. I recommend it to anyone is having problems with oily hair.
B00LYX7ESS|4|I first received this bottle of polish from my mom, she knowing how much I looove nail polish. When I first saw the bottle, it was love at first sight. This is like a lighter pink version of a Barbie color, and has the slightest ribbon of pinkish-peach shimmer that's more noticeable in sunlight or in the bottle. And, you really just need 2 medium coats of polish, then topcoat it with the Gel Topcoat. It allies smooth, but on the first coat, it's a bit streaky. The topcoat will help cover up any mistakes you made. I often use a non-gel topcoat after the gel one cures, for a super-mega glossy shine.<br /> This product also claims that it can last &#34;Up To 14 Days!&#34; but for me, about 8 until a couple of chips got on my nerves, hence on of the reasons why I gave this 4 stars.<br />Overall, I think this is a great investment to an alternative of a gel or Shellac manicure. The nail polish applies well, dries fast, and is super glossy. But, it's WAY cheaper at my local CVS, and only cost about $9.99 with my CVS Extra Bucks card.
B003ZTVDBS|5|Nobody knows how to build a Q-tip like the Q-tip people.  Perfection begins with the 100% (I think) rolled paper wand and concludes with the two delicately and perfectly balanced swabs on the ends.  This, is the pinnacle of cotton swab engineering.  These things can be used on any project from ears to chainsaws and their performance is the stuff of legend.    Don't buy that cheapo knockoff brand that gives you a super flexible, plastic wand and just enough fiber on the ends to legally call it a \\"swab\\".  You need a 100% (I think) rolled paper wand that lets you get some muscle behind whatever it is you're scooping up with those voluptuous pure cotton Q-tip tips.  From crusted ear wax to bar oil laden log dust on your Stihl, you only want to deal with Q-tip brand cotton swabs when it really matters.      Do it right or go hit the dollar store and hope for the best.  Your choice people.  Make yourself proud.
B00CP6I522|5|Purchased this Product in Light and Medium.<br />We are having much Sun, now that summer<br />is here....Lots of hot sun....I will work with a<br />natural tan from the sun...I am fair so am<br />careful in the sun....This product stays<br />put.  I use it everywhere as needed, LOL.<br />Even use it on my face.<br />I ordered much because I was fearful, it may<br />not always be available....Enjoy, I hope you like it.<br />I have sensitive skin and so far so good.
B001F51RL0|1|I've used this growing up since I was probably 7 or 8 years old. It was the only shampoo that took care of dandruff and left my hair feeling smooth. Any other shampoo would leave it feeling sticky and after it dried it would be like straw. Dry and frizzy. I have SHORT hair, so if I notice this stuff it's bad.<br /><br />Now H&S is just like the rest of them. I noticed it and I've just kept on using it anyway because I thought my hair had just changed. Now I see all the other negative comments. :(<br /><br />Time to start mixing my own, I guess.
B0006NAYBQ|3|I ordered the wrong brush and had a less expensive contour brush that works as well.  I will order more of this product though, the makeup is great!
B00OK6YCQ8|3|Cute brought for gift
B004INCW9M|3|On my hair, the Feria colors are brilliant the first day, then fade fast with each washing. Some shades leave residue on my pillow, or more especially my towels. Please use a dark towel that matches your haircolor!  These are GREAT for that special event you want the exact cool vivid color for - it will do the job! but for long-term maintenance I would have to color every week to keep up the day-of brightness. It COULD very well be just my hair chemistry with their formulas. That said, I do love every shade I have tried and I have used several of them off and on for a year.
B0085O7MVI|5|NOTE: I am reviewing many of these eye shadows from the same seller so a lot of my reviews may contain similar or copy & pasted information since they were all bought at the same time but were different listings. But the review applies to all of them.<br /><br />I am not a hardcore all-natural type of consumer and still have non-mineral products in my collection, but recently I decided to give mineral eye shadow a try and I am pleased and will probably go with mineral shadow from now on.<br /><br />When applied with a moist brush the colors really pop around the eyes due to the mixed in primer and I have been able to play around and get some very delicious looks using this eye shadow.<br /><br />The containers have an insert like a salt or pepper shaker and what I do is shake out a small amount into the lid and it keeps the rest of it safe from any gusts of wind or fans that might be nearby. The insert can be removed though if you need to get to the powder directly.<br /><br />The containers are also quite small but if you are a person who only puts makeup on occasionally or just not every day, they may be perfect. If you are a heavy makeup user you may want to find larger containers. They are definitely the perfect size to test out whether or not you like the makeup. I had zero problems with the size of them personally but I have read a lot of reviews on similar makeups complaining about the size.<br /><br />It is worth noting that one of the sets I bought was not sent by mistake, and a different set was sent in it's place.<br />GOOD NEWS THOUGH... I contacted the seller and was sent the correct set without hassle and I didn't even need to ship the other one back! Excellent customer service! I will definitely buy again.
B001S2PLNK|5|I have bought these multiple times! I was sick of the inside of my Sonicare Essence getting tons of bacteria on the inside of it from water leaking in. I had to clean it every time I brushed my teeth. I have used sonic seal for over a year. I put a new one on every time I replace the toothbrush head. I have never had one tear, so I could even reuse them. They keep all the water out and I'm not cleaning my toothbrush all the time! I do wish they came in just clear, but the colors are nice if you have 2 toothbrushes. Buy this product!
B00V44Q4U6|3|Decal designs were not as I expected, and it was a very small package.
B00G6T4U2I|5|Its a great product my thick curly damage hair. Love it.
B00GW1JBU6|4|I just received the Peace aromatherapy spray manufactured by blue river.  It smells so good.  The aroma is very concentrated and very little needs to be used so a bottle will last a long time. I love the scent and the peaceful feeling I get when I spritz it on. This spray will work for a room freshener as well.  I have always been very interested in using all types of essential oils for aromatherapy, body care and medicinal purposes. I will be checking out their catalog for other essential oil products which are all 100% pure.  Oils are hard to find that are made with 100% pure essential oils.  Many oils have added ingredients of alcohol or other filler oils.  I was very excited to receive this item in exchange for my honest review.  I am always happy to try new products that are made with pure and natural ingredients.
B00CXAD8TA|5|The most wonderful hand lotion!  Creamy, without being greasy...soft, subtle smell...not flowery.  Lasts a long time.<br />I see why they call it &#34;Cashmere&#34;!
B008V9PJS0|5|This is a repeat buy from a little house internal competition of leave in conditioners for our daughters super curly, frizzy and dry hair. We tested this one as well as:<br />Giovanni Direct Leave-In Conditioner, Weightless moisture conditioner 8.5 fl oz Bottle<br />Johnson's No More Tangles Leave-in Conditioner, 5 Ounce<br />Nexxus Hyrda Sleek Silken Smoothing Conditioner<br />Lanza Hair Repair Leave In Protector KB2 33.8oz<br />Kb2 Lightweight Protectant Leave In Conditioner By L'Anza for Unisex, 10.1 Ounce<br />Beautiful Curls Leave-In Conditioner for Curly to Kinky Hair -- 12 oz<br />All of which were rated rather well and came at a reasonable price compared to some of the salon products.<br />The Dominican Magic conditioner came out as the winner. It was the only one that was light weight (you can use a lot to distribute in long hair without weighing it down), reduced frizz, smelled great, and provided shine and softness to her hair. We've been using it for 9 months now as the main conditioner and keep playing with other products but so far haven't found one that satisfies us more. Some of the listed products are really heavy, especially the Giovanni, and probably good for short hair. We didn't like the Johnson's product at all. It seemed not very rich but still weighed the hair down almost like a gel
B00ISC9NF0|5|good
B00ENDTS4E|2|I have dark brown/auburn hair and the Dark Brown matches nicely.  I like the product because it's a gel and goes on sheer and light, yet it covers the gray.  It doesn't wipe off on your hands or sunglasses, etc after it dries.  The biggest problem is the applicator.  It's a lovely plush brush that would be great for painting a picture.  However, for putting the product on your roots, it's not so good.  The brush is almost an inch long and wide so you have to pump a lot of product out into the brush to get it to the ends so you can put it on your roots.  I like to touch up my roots as soon as they start showing at a quarter of an inch. But with this applicator you have to use a lot of product to get it to the ends of the brush.  Basically, it wastes a lot and then isn't very precise.  So, I took some nice scissors and cut off most of the applicator brush.  It's not perfect, but it's better.  My suggestion to the company would be to replace the brush with a much shorter one.  It seems easy enough since it just snaps off.  My other problem with the applicator is that the bottom of the bottle is where you press to squirt the color into the brush.  However, you'll find that you inadvertently press the bottom when you snap the top on and when you sit the tube down on the counter.  Again, it's wasting the product, which is a problem for the obvious reason, but also a problem because you can't see how much is in there to begin with, therefore, you'll never know when you're about to run out.  I would love to see the company do some serious repackaging of a great gray coverup.
B00EYSVQS4|5|These are great because they are long and slightly curved. I have curly hair and they slide in without flattening the curls.
B008ND0RVS|5|I used this over a white face paint and it stayed in place really well, even though I was sweating, touching my face, and hugging people all day.
B00JEGSJ0O|5|Excellent product. You will see improvement after a few weeks of continues use. Highly recommend this Growth Stimulator from BioHair-Care.
B004PN4V26|5|I will never go to another product now that I've discovered Intra Force Hair Densifier.  It thickens my hair and makes the style look like it did in the salon.  My hair is very fine; like a child's and has no body on its own.  I love this product.
B00ICPLHCU|4|hi I've been using this product on and off when I remember and it seems to be maing a difference in my skin, its winter in the poconos which can be harsh on a person's skin but I've been noticing I use less moisturizer so yay for this product I hope to feel more of its results when I'm less forgetful about taking it
B005GM3LW6|4|GOOD
B00ENNVDQ0|5|Best Shampoo for silver or gray hair I have ever found. Leaves my hair soft and bouncy without a fake purple cast.
B00JITDVM8|4|good shaver easy to clean ,.charge lasts me a long time
B001V9SXXU|5|A plus
B00COYJ9CU|4|i received my perfume on time and was very happy. the perfume has a nice smell and cute design.Inside the package there were 2 free samples of other Etude products which was a nice bonus
B000YIYCSY|5|I love this stuff. It is very light, but gives me volume in my otherwise flat, fine hair. It also does not fade my color like other products have done.
