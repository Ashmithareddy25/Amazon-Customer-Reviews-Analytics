B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney really surprised me with this album. It's actually very, very, very good. And it's good to know that Britney is finally getting in control with her music. Perhaps that is why it's so good. I can't wait until she works on her next album and once this album gets nominated for all the awards it deserves. Britney seems to get better and better. And to all the haters out there, you're really sad. So yes, it's a good album so buy it!!
6305428522|5.0|Quiz Show and Schindler's List are Ralph Fiennes' best roles.  All his subsequent movies are just a rehash of the tormented adulterer from The English Patient.  The entire cast does a superb job of showing us what makes their characters tick.  The story itself is an interesting look at how the early television industry developed.  A must-see.
B00000064F|5.0|Some consider this 1970 album as a departure from its predecessor, &quot;Five Leaves Left&quot;, but it should be said that &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;, with its jazz-oriented style, presents some of the sadder and beautiful songs ever written by Nick Drake in his too-short career. This was the first Nick Drake record I have listened and it was responsible for my unconditional love for his songs. &quot;Northern Sky&quot; might even be his best song, and the instrumental &quot;Sunday&quot; is surely a masterpiece. This record has that rare ability of changing lifes forever. It's a definite masterpiece.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I discovered John Mayer through the song &quot;83&quot; -- his track on the Serendipity soundtrack. Like that song, this album is defined by an appealingly mellow folk/rock sound, and fits nicely on my shelf next to other male pop/folk/rock artists like Duncan Sheik and David Gray. The lyrics may not be anything particularly meaningful, but they're basically harmless. This is an excellent album for servicing romantically angsty moods.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember is my favorite romance book that I've ever read. I read the book this summer for something to read because I hadn't read much books and all the teen books that I looked at didn't catch my interest. I hadn't heard about Nicholas Sparks until actually last year when my PE class was watching Message In The Bottle and I usually liked books over movie. So I decided to give this guy a shot. The minute I began reading it I was hooked.<br />Landon Carter is a senior about to hit adulthood and is still unsure what he wants out of life. He believes that he's been in love with a girl or two. He and his friends shun the minister's daughter, Jamie because she does good things and loves to read her Bible daily. <br />Jamie is a shy girl, who only wants to do good and be there for her father since her mother died when she was little. She also always is involved in something, whether it be the orphange or the annual Christmas play that she always in.<br />Over the course of the senior year, Landon and Jamie end up going to a dance together because he needed a date. She later on asks him to be in the play with her. From there on, Landon sees Jamie as the person she is and how beautiful she on the inside as well as the outside. Love sparks between the two of them and everything seems to be falling into place until Jamie reveals something to Landon. I won't tell you what, so you will just have to read it to find out. This story is beautifully written and it will definetely affect you in some way. Be prepared for tears though. <br />So cuddle up, and have a tissue box near by and you will be all set.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I have never written an online review about a movie before.  I usually just read reviews from others.  Today, reading some of these low-rating reviews inspired me to write my own review.  Several other reviewers said this was the worst movie ever.  I however, feel it is the BEST movie ever!!!!  Many people criticized Kidman and McGregor for their lack of musical talent.  I have a degree from a hightly-respected conservatory.  I have also taught music lessons.  I have heard the best and the worst.  They absolutely are not the best but let me tell you, I've heard a lot worse.  I think they did pretty well for their first vocal performances.<BR>     This movie is probably greater appreciated by people who love music, art, theater, etc.  Although, if you are not one of those people, you should challenge yourself to see this movie anyway.  This is a MODERN MUSICAL.  Baz is trying to take new things (like the modern music) and marry it with the old in an attempt to reach a new audience that maybe has less exposre to musicals.  The way the music tells the story is absolutely amazing.  If you were to listen only to the music you would be able to feel the emotions of what is happening in the movie.<BR>     I have to admit, when they began to perform &quot;Roxanne&quot; I thought this was a little over the top.  My mind was soon changed.  The anger, turmoil, distress, and conflict of this movie came to it's climax through this song.  No movie has ever made me feel so deeply the emotions of the characters.  The music of this song is so perfectly matched to each increasingly dramatic mini-scene.  It's almost sensory overload!!<BR>     This movie, in addition, does not have the &quot;Happily-ever-after Hollywood&quot; ending.  It's a movie about love and &quot;real&quot; (in a fairy-tale sense) life.  It's raw:  life, love, motivation, inspiration, talent, friendship, fortune, desire and tragedy.<BR>     In this movie the scenes are beautiful; the use of color is astonishing.  Luhrman uses some incredible effects that make you feel like you are living in a fairy tale land.<BR>     An interesting side note is that Director Baz Luhrmann has made this the third movie of a trilogy.  The first being Stictly Ballroom, in which he used dance to tell his story.  In Romeo and Juliet he used language and finally in Moulin Rouge he used music/song.<BR>     This is not the movie for you if you want to critique the actors on their new-found singing abilities or you hate doing &quot;artsy&quot; things.  If you prefer the traditional, middle-of-the-road, happily-ever-after movies, don't see this movie.  <BR>     This is the movie for you if you want to expand your horizons or if you love drama, art, dance, beauty and music.  If you are open-minded at all . . . then open up your mind and your heart and let this wonderfully moving and creative movie in.  It's a movie that makes you laugh and cry.  To me, that's the best kind.
B00005MG2Y|5.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; the best CD I own-and I own a lot of CDs.It is the only one that I can remeber from beginning to end and listen to daily.  It is a great CD and I cant wait for the next onbe to come out.
0553284347|5.0|My counsellor gave me this book and said &quot;I think you need to read this&quot;.  Boy, did I ever!!  I could be reading about me on every page of the book - every emotion, self-doubt, self-loathing, self-disgust and thinking it was all my fault, in fact, everything I had ever felt was there, and suddenly everything made sense.  I had been having great difficulty in accepting that I had been a victim of abuse.  All I kept saying was that I shouldn't be whining about my life when others have suffered worse than me, then I read Toxic Parents, and realised I had to admit that I was a victim too, or I would never get better.  When I first read the section about Confrontation, I thought I'd rather die than rock the boat and confront my father - but a few months (and re-reads) later, I feel that I now have the strength to confront my father and deal with the consequences.  My partner and a few select close friends (who know the REAL me) have seen me grow up and take charge of my life, and they all agree that I am about 100% emotionally healthier now, and it's all down to Susan Forwards' book.  Before reading toxic parents I was marching towards self-destruction, now I am learning to live life to the fullest, I have left behind my emotional baggage, and am free to discover a life worth living.
B000002UB3|5.0|I, as an interesting Beatles fan, love &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, yet I disagree with some of the main feelings some have toward a couple songs in particular.  First of all, I agree that the Harrison songs are amazing and that the Ringo song is very &quot;pleasant&quot;.  Of course, the medley at the end is an amazing finish as well.  Yet I cannot in any way criticize &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;.  That is one amazing Lennon song, showcasing his unmatched ability to say so much with so few words.  For me, and maybe some others, that song represents the ultimate torment one experiences in loving someone who they can never be with.  The feeling is unhealthy obsession for a person (can be lust or even real love) but no matter what, it is a heart-wrenching feeling I have felt that I have never seen so well displayed in a song.  I don't think it's one second too long.  The instrumental buildup at the end shows how one cannot stop beating their head against the wall for a person they have loved and perhaps lost and how their anguish haunts them for so long.  That to me is why the song cuts off abruptly, it shows the pain is really still going on.  Anyway, the only other minor comment I have is &quot;Her Majesty&quot;, which I love.  I think it's a great ending for the album, showing how simple and humorous the Beatles were under all their greatness, not taking themselves too seriously to enjoy the simple pleasures in life.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|I have been a steadfast Prince/Artist listener for nearly 20 years, and admittedly, I am biased in favor of the LPs he created during his \\"Golden Age\\" (1999 to Lovesexy), and various outings since. With that in mind, I do not think Prince's latest effort compares to his other work. \\"Rainbow Children\\" is like many of his post-\\"Gold Experience\\" albums: satisfying at points, musically masterful, but thematically confusing and lyrically muddled.<br />The musical arrangements on this album are the best since \\"The Gold Experience.\\" Prince's new, \\"organic\\" sound - jazzy, soulful, devoid of post-New Jack Swing R & B or rap pretensions - gives me hope for greater things down the line. The title track, \\"Muse 2 the Pharaoh,\\" and \\"1+1+1=3\\" are great grooves, along with \\"Mellow Mellow.\\" His new band is very good. Musically, the album rivals anything I've heard this year.<br />Lyrically, I hate to say it, but Prince has lost me. This album announces Prince's 3rd spiritual post-Black Album transformation <BR>(the first two transformations are announced on \\"Lovesexy\\" and \\"Emancipation\\"). In his interviews, appearances, website messages, and his music, he has trumpeted his newly found Jehovah's Witness beliefs (thank Larry Graham for that). This has marginalized him from his audience, which had been attracted to his spritual themes of independence, faith and hope, and were fascinated by the spiritual struggles conveyed in his previous work. \\"RC\\" continues this unfortunate trend with ramblings about God, kings, evil ones, muses, wise ones and pharaohs. Sometimes, it's hard to tell which of these ramblings are tenets of faith or figments of Prince's imagination. <br />Prince also tries to cram a lot of social statements into the wrong cut at the wrong time. Predictably, a lot of what he says is out of context, and the listener is confused by the actual meaning (on \\"Muse,\\" is he really minimizing the Holocaust or deeming all human suffering evil?). As a result, the positive messages insongs like \\"Last December\\" are lost in the haze. Prince has always been challenging, but some of the views expressed on this album alienate the listeners. That's a first for a Prince LP.<br />Ultimately, \\"RC\\" is a deeply flawed \\"almost-masterpiece.\\" Prince's great \\"statement\\" songs are not funky, terse, and spiritually profound (\\"Pop Life,\\" \\"Money Don't Matter 2Night,\\" \\"Purple Rain,\\" etc.). The message of faith Prince delivers on the first track of \\"Lovesexy,\\" \\"Eye No,\\" is clearer and more powerful than all of \\"RC\\" combined. You want a spiritual manifesto from Prince? Check that out. <br />Prince is the greatest single rock n' roll artist since Hendrix, and can still make a great LP. Sadly, \\"RC\\" is not in that class. While I'm glad I have this album, I cautiously await Prince's next transformation. Hopefully it will produce a truly great LP. Otherwise, we'll have to appreciate the great music he's already given us.
B000002KIE|5.0|You may find this hard to believe, but I love this album so much that I can listen to it every day.  I'm not big on punk rock, especially the new breed, but this is probably the &quot;classic album&quot; of the late-seventies, period.  Yes there were others before the Sex Pistols, but to me they were the first true greats, the first to truly embody the dirty, lowdown, attitude-laden spirit of classic punk rock.  Arguably, a better punk rock album has not been released since.  Why you ask?  Just look how many memorable punk classics the Pistols crammed onto this, their first and only album.  Of course they would never release another album, this one could never be topped and it would be silly to try.  I'm sorry to offend any hardcore punkers but I have more respect for a punk rock act like this that just burned out instead of faded away.  Making more than one album as a punk rock band is silly, you just start repeating yourself and take away from the heat of the moment of the punk rock experience.  This was the ultimate &quot;heat of the moment&quot;.  It is mostly classic songs with little filler.  Not to mention these songs are catchy.  It's funny to see a punk rock band with such poppy hooks, but the combination makes this a unique rock record, well-crafted with such rough edges.  Other punk bands that followed simply lacked the melody and memoribility to be as classic as the Pistols.  So yeah, there are many great moments which I wont bother to mention, all the way down to the passionate shouting of John Lydon which concludes with a mouth-fart of defiance.
B00005R2IS|5.0|This is a true low budget classic. But unlike earlier releases of this film you get such a clear picture that you can see the rope used to pull one of the bikers off his bike. You can even hear Mel Gibson's voice coming from Mel Gibson's mouth. Who knew that they spoke in English is Austrailia? This was like watching the film for the first time. Finally the REAL version for all Mad Max fans out there.
0385505833|2.0|With the talent that John Grisham possesses in his ability to write a great mystery novel, this story is silly and much beneath him and his skills.  I found it a time waster and I regret the money I paid to purchase it.  Mr. Grisham -- stick to what you do best!
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is clearly a masterpiece. Tracks 7 (Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa, &quot;Nice Weather for an Airstrike&quot;) and 9 (Agaetis Byrjun, &quot;A New Beginning&quot;) are among the finest pieces of ambient rock ever produced. Iceland proves once again it rules the music innovation department.
630463949X|5.0|My mom introduced me to Fleetwood Mac when this reunion concert came out in 97. I am 14 now and I must say this is the best concert I have ever seen! Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are incredible. From the first moment on when you hear the beginning of the AWESOME opener &quot;The Chain&quot; you know this concert is gonna be great. I love Gold Dust Woman on here, I can't believe they didn't put it on the cd! Silver Springs, Rhiannon, and Landslide are other high points for our beloved Stevie, while Go Insane and Big Love are 2 songs  Lindsey is incredible on. Buy this DVD, you wont be disappointed. Fleetwood Mac rules!
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have loved No Doubt forever. And despite what some people say... I think it is great that their music changes and evolves as should any band. Would you really want to have a band come out with 5 CDs that are all the same...woo hoo.<BR>I love this CD just like the rest. Can I give it 6 stars?
B00005QDW1|2.0|No Doubt is one of my favorite bands of all time, so it was only natural that I was excited about the release of Rock Steady.But when I heard the songs,I felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of The Wedding Singer...BROKEN.All of the songs are very repetitive and they all sound horribly similar.I deeply miss the feel of Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn,where they show their true feelings in each and every song.But when I listen to Rock Steady,I can no longer relate to the songs in any way.I also think that the rest of the band(not including Gwen)is dropped in the album.Drums and guitars are replaced with computers(keyboards,etc.).<BR>The bottom line:If you enjoyed No Doubt,Beacon Street,and Tragic Kingdom,you will regret buying this album.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I feel that Pearl Harbor is an amazing movie. I must admitt that before I saw it I felt it would be a long, dragged out, and boring movie. But once I sat down and watched it, I was very glad I had. It makes you laugh, cry, and keeps you on the edge off your seat for a couple action scences. It demonstartes what a horrible and terrible tradegy Pearl Harbor actually was. The acting in this movie is very well done. The filming in this movie is great. The special effects are wonderfully done and it makes you feel like you were right in the middle of the bombing. Teenage girls may be attracted to this movie more than others, but it is still a great movie for everyone. The war scences satisfy the hunger for action; the love triangle plot fufills any romantic's need for love. The history illustrated in this spectacular movie is one of tragedy but demonstrates te true strength of america. I suggest you watch it and make your own personal decision, but in my opinion Pearl Harbor is most definatly worht the 3 hours and 3 minutes.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This is the best cd if i was on  a desert island I would take this, if you like rage against the machine buy this it has the best rage against the machine songs on it SO BUY IT NOW or if you hve it GO AND LISTEN TO IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
0385484518|2.0|Basically this is a decent book until you see Mitch Albom on tv and see that he goes against all the lessons he has ever learned from Morrie.  Morrie is a good natured man, but his lesson are too much like things you would read in a Hallmark card.  It was very old to keep reading his lessons because there were so many and they were all the same basic idea.  Basicallyyou could read the first few chapters and still understand the entire book.
6302969352|5.0|First off I would like to rant a little about the people who say this movie is a &quot;kung fu&quot; movie or a ripoff of of The Magnificant Seven.  I would love for people like this to do a little research and even a little brain power before they put thoughts into print.  <BR>Okay, now with that off my chest, on with my thoughts on this movie.  This movie is a classic and is ranked next to Citizen Kane for the top spot for best film ever made.  Excellent character development, directing, acting, atmosphere.  The whole film just radiates greatness.
B00005RYQO|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD IT INSPIRED ME TO JOIN THE IMPORT STREET RACEING WORLD.I CANT WAIT TO BUY THIS MOVIE.AS SOON AS I GET A DVD PLAYER.I AM GOING TO BUY FOR SURE. THERE ARE OTHER STREET RACERS WHERE I LIVE EXCEPT ONE AND HE HAS AN ECLIPSE.
0060012331|2.0|I knew this wasn't meant to be an equal Discworld novel when I first opened it, but nevertheless I was disappointed. This lacks the character and fancy of Pratchett's other books. I kept expecting the plot to take an interesting twist, as Discworld novels often do, but was failed.<br />Also, I was disturbed by a passage in which a rat-catcher strikes the young heroine - a blow so well described that I feel the fist in my own face... particularly distressing to read in juvenile literature.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|&quot;Memento&quot; provides a cleverly executed gimmick, well above current Hollywood standards, but is that enough?
6305648522|5.0|I love this movie. Ive watched it over and over. This movie deserves 5 stars. But I want to see full length of this stunning movie. If you didn't see full length of original movie, you missed some moving moments and reason why they couldn't meet in their past. Try to find uncut version of this amazing tale. You will cry again.
B000005HAU|5.0|Bireli Lagrene - Standards <BR>I could say that Bireli Lagrene is simply the best flat-pick swing/bop jazz guitarist I have ever heard, but there are many others who are great also, for varying reasons. His first album came out when he was only 13 years old and since then he has proved himself to be one of those people born to play the guitar. He is immensely musical and his technique is flawless. His virtuosity is never displayed for its own sake, however: the music always comes first and takes on a life of its own. He is not an innovator as much as simply a virtuoso - and what a passionate player he is. If I was to vote a single jazz guitar standards album as the best ever, it would of course be largely a question of taste - but none could surpass this one. Although other players are more harmonically innovative, his musicality and virtuosity are overwhelming here. (If you can't track this one down, try 'Live in Marciac', which, in my opinion, is not quite up to this standard, but is worth a listen)
B00005U2LM|3.0|This CD is not what I expected. First when I listened to it I thought it was great. But after a few weeks I changed my mind. \\"Enter The Wu-Tang\\" is a masterpiece and so is \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\".<BR>When they released \\"The W\\" in the late 2000 I thought it just was an isolated case. But it wasn't.
B00005QKGM|5.0|My opinion is radically different from the other reviewer's here-below!<BR>This recording is really great as it preserves Behrens' last interpretation of Elektra. She was already recorded commercially by Philips in 1988 under Ozawa. That was an interesting version but far from a reference. Maybe because Behrens still lacked some experience of the character although she already was in her early fifties! Because Strauss' opera interpretation requires incredible vocal demands together with character and experience of singing the role, live on stage. In particular, Elektra is terrifying for the actress has to sing during the whole opera though it is rather short and in only one act but, she must give everything in 90 minutes!<BR>Like Leonie Rysanek that great straussian singer who only dared to tackle the role at 55 and during a recording session, I agree that no singer should try it at an early age without irreversible damaging effects on the voice. Even a Nilsson would start singing it at nearly 50 and after many Isoldes or Brnnhildes!<BR>I must recognize an exciting listening for us would be a firm, beautiful and young tone into the role because Elektra should only be around 25 after all. But which singer could actually sing it with the necessary maturity for the dramatic theatre during 20 or 30 years long?<BR>HILDEGARD BEHRENS is the right answer : because she can sustain the legato line while showing her comprehension of the role although with some edges in the voice that even make us better understand what Elektra has experienced. Further she never shouts and her interpretation is this time supreme and the tone is full and beautiful. I'm fond of older interpretations from Borkh, Varnay, Schlter and Goltz but that Behrens' is the best of them all!<BR>The advantage is that the rest of the cast is equally superior!<BR>Rysanek sang the second role of Chrysothemis for nearly 40 years before she gave up for that of Klytemnestra (after one attempt at recording the title role). I've always found her too mature for Chrysothemis but as the mother she is at nearly 70 simply perfect, surpassing Madeira, Resnik or any other, terrific!<BR>DeVol is from the new generation of singers but very different from a Studer or a Marc. The voice is steady and very stylish indeed. She does not add any useless accents but her interpretation is warm and simple, convincing and vocally commanding without any under-the-note attacks.<BR>The names of the men are rather anonymous but equivalently characterful with the recognition scene particularly moving so that each meeting of Elektra with her sister (three times), her mother, her brother or her father-in-law is like a chess confrontation.<BR>Not to forget is the 5th maid remarkably sung just like Horne at Salzburg in 1957 with Mitropoulos...<BR>The orchestra is a small one and does not sound like the Vienna Philharmonic but exactly gives the right dimension to the drama.<BR>The recording is very vivid, not totally atmospheric but suits well to that opera.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is again one of his master pieces. Enrique only knows how to make the best CDs which takes your mind off everything stressfull. I really like his music, it really calms you.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I'm so disappointed that so many songs are missing.  I've only seen the movie twice, yet there are songs still playing in my head that are NOT on this sountrack.  Marcia Ford listed them, and what about the techno version of &quot;Come What May&quot; that's in the Extras portion of the DVD?<br />I would have MUCH preferred Smells Like/Lady Marmalade, The Show Must Go On, Like A Virgin, the dialogue of Roxanne, etc...to the David Bowie and Beck pieces on this CD.  And I SO wanted Children of the Revolution/The Sound of Music to be on here, not to mention Spectacular, Spectacular.  And &quot;Because We Can&quot; wasn't even really in the film but for a tiny bit.  Go figure.  If another CD comes out, I'm getting it, but I would have preferred a double CD set if necessary, released at once.<br />3 stars for not having the songs I want, but at least some of them are really enjoyable and evoke the movie well.  And I would have liked the booklet to have the words of the songs, not just the titles.  I'm still happy I bought the soundtrack, and my husband really likes some songs too--I was just expecting more.
B000002UCN|4.0|I bought this CD shortly after Mr. Harrison's death. Listening to the sound tracks (some of which I hadn't heard before) was pure enjoyment.  &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; are classic Harrison writings.  I am thoroughly enjoying his music and would buy this particular CD again.
0800129806|5.0|This is an outstanding movie of love, and the disires of love.  This movie is placed in the Camolot, and around King Arthur and the knights of the round table.  Lady Gwenivere has some early trials in the begin of the movie, one such cut of an ambush on her carriage going from her land of Leoness to king Arthurs side in Camolot.  In this chase for her livelyhood Gwenivere throws herself and her two ladies in waiting from the moving carriage, where Lancelot makes his first rescuse.  This is an intising film and it comes highly recommended for all the romantic people out there.
6304082428|5.0|I'm glad I'm not the only viewer that finds themselves suprisingly and uncharacteristically 'obsessed' with this production of Pride and Prejudice.  Frankly, I'm glad to know there is not something mentally wrong with me! (yes, its THAT good.)    This A&E/BBC series is without flaw, and in fact, quite addicting.  I saw this on A&E several years ago and was enthralled, and recently purchased the video set so I could see it again.  It recaptured me immediately!  It is almost impossible to watch just one tape per evening, so have 4 1/2 hours of free time available so you can watch the whole thing.  Be prepared you will find yourself remembering scenes for days afterwards...it stays with you.  It can be watched again and again and will enchant every time.    Colin Firth (Darcy) smolders, Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) enchants, the entire case is perfectly played.  The story and this production leaves you believing these characters actually lived. In fact, I recently saw Jennifer Ehle in another movie and was struck by the reality she is in fact an actress and not really Elizabeth!    The scenery, costuming and music are just as engaging as the story.  A beautiful production all around and an investment that will be rewatched again and again.
0064407667|4.0|I have been hearing about The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket for about a year, and I had heard mostly good reviews about it. I got this book for Christmas, and I whipped through it in about three days. I found it to be quite amusing, mostly because of the author's continuing commentary on just how depressing the book was. The characters may not be the most well-developed or unique that have ever been created, but I found the story just plain funny. One thing I must say I did not like about it was how the author kept defining words in their context in the story. That was unneccessary, and it got very annoying when words that most kids know were defined over and over again. If you have heard that this is as good as Harry Potter, well, it's not. Not many books are as good as Harry Potter. But The Bad Beginning is a good book to fill the time, and I reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good laugh.
B000021YQV|4.0|This is NOT nu metal.  I repeat, this is not nu metal.  This is not to be categorized with commercial creampuffs such as Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and Disturbed.  I can not stand those bands.  I almost didn't buy this CD because I feared it would sound like Godsmack.  This is not nu metal.  This is good intelligent brainy metal. This is heavy and brutal, yet sophisticated in the same sense.  It's a cross of Black Sabbath, The Dead Kennedy's,Faith No More's Angel Dust and Tool.  NOT Linkin Park.  Best songs are The Prison Song, Chop Suey, and Deer Dance.  If you can't stand commercialized junk/rap metal like Crazy Town, and are in need of something real, buy this CD.
0679777547|4.0|I find Perez-Reverte's books to be both diverting and challenging reading.  He fills The Club Dumas with such interesting referentials to Dumas, The Three Musketeers, and books on the occult that one begins to develop a list of books to read (or reread).  The plot is intriguing enough in itself, but I enjoy the challenge that one must be well-read or, at least, somewhat knowlegeble in many areas to appreciate the true depth of the work.  I think the comparison to Umberto Eco is most apt.  The Club Dumas is not a light read, but it was an illuminating one.
B00004XQ83|3.0|I'm a long-time listener of bluegrass, old-country and gospel music since early childhood.  I found this soundtrack to be somewhat disappointing and certainly not as &quot;outstanding&quot; as some of the previous reviewers and critics have said.  How it was voted &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, I'll never know. Maybe because I haven't seen the movie.  It does contain a few of the great, old-timers singing some of their best music, however the rest of the songs are by bands I've never heard of and they don't quite do justice to the songs as the original artists. Most of the music tends to be geared towards prison, death, dying, and heaven. Because of this, it may certainly fit well with the movie. I'm not sure why &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorry&quot; is recorded at 2 separte intervals on the CD, but then, this song is well worth listening to twice. If you're into the movie, you may be into this CD.  However, if you haven't seen the movie, I certainly wouldn't rush out to buy this soundtrack.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is probably the most comprehensive collection of 60s' garage rock ever assembled and my only regret is that I didn't buy it much sooner.<br />If you want to hear some great songs from the 1960s' that you will never hear listening to the &quot;oldies&quot; station, then buy this 4 cd set of homemade rock and roll.<br />&quot;Please don't let them stretch their necks.  To see my little black egg with the little white specks.&quot;  The Nightcrawlers (eat your heart out, Bob Dylan)
B00004T8RK|5.0|I read a review beneath this that said: &quot;The Pearl Jam of Ten and Vs. is dead. Over. Done.&quot;<br />This album is 100% different than they're previous releases. To look at it with any pre-recognition of the songs that made Pearl Jam famous is doing the album a disservice. Grunge died with Kurt Cobain. Pearl Jam evolved so they could survive. Just like the Smashing Pumpkins.<br />But on to the album itself:<BR>1) Breakerfall is an expedient, rock riff that reminds me of Hail, Hail or Last Exit. A great album-opener.<BR>2) Gods' Dice left me uneasy. What are you supposed to feel aside from resignation after hearing this? That's it. Resignation is what they where shooting for.<BR>3) Evacuation, while better live, gives you a feeling of surrendered fate... a finale to the three openers, really. The song about the Columbine massacre gives a sense of desensitized horror. Like a deer in headlights.<BR>4) Light Years, to me, is an 'extension' of Last Kiss, in a way. The feel from it rings of 50s rock, and could easily be a soliloquy to the woman who died in Last Kiss. One of the most underrated songs on the album.<BR>5) when I heard Nothing as it Seems, I had to double-check the CD to make sure I wasn't listening to Pink Floyd. Not only a comment on Pearl Jam's diversity, but their pure technical superiority over most bands today.<BR>6) Thin Air seems almost out of place, though beautiful. The closest thing to a love song PJ has ever done.<BR>7) Insignificance is Eddie Vedder at his best. A song reminiscent of Yield's Do The Evolution. A song full of political commmentary.<BR>8) Matt Cameron and Jeff Ament SHINE on Of The Girl. The best track of Binaural. It shows how much better the band has become in pure skill. Eddie no longer fights for the foreground, but sits back and hums ALONG with the exquisite music.<BR>9) Grievance, about the WTO, is another spot where Vedder shines. His cynical best.<BR>10) Sleight of Hand is almost a reprise of Nothing as it Seems. I wonder if the man in the lyrics of both tracks are one and the same.<BR>11) Soon Forget. Bill Gates just became even more immortalized. This tale of indulgence done with only the bare esentials is ironic and betrays Eddie's subtle sense of humour.<BR>12) Parting Ways is just that. The band saying goodbye. Some will cheer. Others will cry.<br />Goodbye Pearl Jam. Thank you for the windows into our souls.
0385505833|5.0|For crying out loud, can't Grisham have any fun?  This is a wonderful hilarious book about one poor smuck trying to get away with his wife for a 10 day cruise and forgetting all about the Christmas hulabaloo altogether.<br />It is a laugh out loud kind of book and just because it doesn't have 15 lawyers in it, some of my fellow reviewers are criticizing it.<br />Buy it, read it and enjoy it in the spirit in which it was written.
B00004U30D|2.0|If it wasn't for the cinematography and acting, would this be considered a great movie?  I don't think so.  To me it's mostly style over substance, and derivative and imitative as well.  Examples:  A middle-aged suburban guy discovers his life is empty and his job is demeaning.  Wow, there's a new one.  Second, the teenage daughter hates her parents and feels unwanted.  Gee, how original.  Third, the wife is frigid and controlling - there's some imiginative thinking for you!  And the kid next door is a loner and considered weird, but turns out to be sensitive and wise.  Again, what originality.<BR>Most every scene is predictable and hackneyed.  Example:  The retired Marine next door is greeted by his gay neighbors with a welcome basket (fruit, of course).  The SECOND he opened the door for these two gay neighbors I knew the tough-guy, homophobic Marine would turn out to be secretly gay himself!  Trite and obvious.<BR>And what about the similarities with Fast Times at Ridgmont High??  Yes, you heard me correctly.  Examples:  The most beautiful girl in Fast Times (Phoebe Cates) claims to be sexually active, yet is not!  A.B., same story with the luscious blond cheerleader.  In American B., we have an honest, ordinary guy searching for meaning and his place in life (Kevin Spacey).  In  F. T., same role played by Judge Reinhold.  Isn't Kevin Spacey just playing the grown-up Judge Reinhold?  In American B., there's the dark-haired loner dude, who finds true love in the end.  In F.T., same story with the wise-cracking Italian kid!<BR>The only character in American Beauty who pulled me in and made me care, the only character who was unique and intriguing, was the Marine's wife.  What a lonely, defeated woman.  I wanted to know more about her and a lot less about the other characters.<BR>And the ending involves a gun and a shooting.  Boy, that's a first!  No originality there at all - very disappointing.<BR>In American Beauty the cinematography is glorious and the cast is magnificent, but the movie is a beautiful, hollow shell.
6305308659|4.0|What promises to be a piece of post-modern conceptualism a la 'The Truman Show' or 'Being John Malkovich', turns out to be an Allan/Harold Bloomian plea for cultural conservatism.  TV starts out in the movie as a medium of escape from the trials of everyday life, and of transformation, capable of dismantling certainties of time and place.  It ends up being seen as a propaganda machine for a mind-numbingly reactionary worldview, a wallpaper of consensus barely covering fascist mob instincts. In its place, the Great Liberal Humanities, especially Books (including that over-rated whine 'Catcher in the Rye') and Art, are seen as portals of imagination and freedom.  Of course, this is, as usual, the familiar canon of Dead White Males - women may be allowed model for paintings or study books, but it is the men who create.  Clearly, in a nightmare 'Blue Velvet' world of unthinking suburbia, there can be no place for African Americans, but when this world is turned upside down, there is still little place for them, even in terms of cultural influence (beyond token nods to jazz, which seem more like the director's taste than the film's teenagers).  This blindspot becomes actually offensive when the town is divided into monochrome and 'colored' citizens - white people, having appropriated everything else, have even stolen black suffering!  So what had seemed progressive with its satire of small-town mentality leading to bourgeois violence and book-burning, ends up becoming as conservative and misogynistic as the world it satirises, just as in Frank Capra's famous 'liberal' comedies of the 30s - indeed, the final third of 'Pleasantville' is broken-backed by shrieking Capraesque demagogary.  This is because the 'critique' is framed in terms of individual happiness - there is no question in the film of overturning political or economic structures, of blowing up banks, setting up collectives or starting revolutions.<br />I mention all this because I felt the ideology nearly ruined what had been a truly wonderful film.  I don't care what ultimate values Gary Ross gives them - the play with black-and-white and colour is given such an emotional intensity that each blush of pink smudging the prevailing monochrome makes your heart literally skip a beat.  Ross's mise-en-scne and sense of irony prove someonse steeped in the modes of the 1950s melodrama - it's a shame he ultimately fudges their truly radical critique.
0451204530|3.0|This book is a perfect paperback airplane read.  It moves quickly, is entertaining and is easy to put down and pick back up without losing anything.  And that, in the end, is what's wrong with the book.  It is too superficial with character development and secondary plot lines to offer the reader any depth or flavor.  The book seems to be written as a precurssor to a TV movie script.<br />A fun book to read but ultimately you will be disspointed (especially with the hammy ending).
B0000029DD|5.0|'Grace' opens with what sounds like the birth of a voice; and if Jeff Buckley's fragile falsetto-rock can be compared to anything, it is the gyno-country of Mary Margaret O'Hara.  Whereas most songs are symbolic approximations of the emotions they describe, Buckley's ARE those emotions, evey note and chord-change registering some subtle movement of the heart, body or spirit, each song stuttering with the stops and starts of true, lived-in feeling.  The jangling melody of the title track burns into gospel fervour; 'Lilac Wine' is Neil Hannon at his most quietly naked; 'So Real' shudders with squealing intensity; 'Halleluljah' is rapt, reverb-heavy, campfire Leonard Cohen; 'Lover, You should have come over' bubbling Parisian blues.  Sometimes the album slips into Crazy Horse/Pearl Jam bluster (e.g. 'Eternal Life').  Mostly, 'Grace' is psychosomatic, spiritual soul.
B00005NNU4|5.0|TTD/Sananda has played his cards again and come up with another winner. Again, as on previous albums, he follows his own muse with an eclectic mix of soul,rock,jazz etc. Unfortunately, due to public taste, which seems to equate pop music to a fashion show, his music will never reach a broad appeal. Most consumers can't handle musicality, creativity or talent these days. That aside, anyone who is willing to give this album a try will find themselves humming along and marvelling at his amazing voice and catchy songs. Standout track: O Divina, Testify, Shalom and My Dark Places. Sananda/TTD is truly the most underapreciated musician of our time. Check it this brilliant album of music.
B00005R62K|2.0|My GOD!!! What is this bonus track doing in this remaster?? THis is, simply put, the worst thing Ive ever heard by Judas Priest!! A drum machine, I cant believe!! The rest of the album we all know, of course, its classic.
0380778556|5.0|This was literally the best book I have ever read. The characters were extremely well developed and the book takes you through a journey of a woman learning her place in the world and a man learning to trust agian. A truly remarkable depiction of people as they were and are.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is my all time favorite movie! It is an action filled love story. I dragged my husband with me, and he loved it. It is about Two character Rafe (Ben Affleck)and Danny (Josh Hartnett. Two men in the U.S. Navy. At the beginning of the story Rafe ralls in love with Evelyn, one of the nurses. It goes on, but I wouldn't want to ruin the movie. At the time I went to see it I was pregnant with my second son. My first son's name was Ben. I loved this movie so much we even name our second son Josh.We thought they could be named after Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, who play Rafe and Danny. If you have not seen this movie, I highly recomend it.
B0000025D0|5.0|The album is for those of us who have &quot;the notion deep inside that it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive&quot;.<br />It is no escapist notion; It well recognizes that we live &quot;the working, the working, just the working life&quot;; &quot;it's never over it's relentless as the rain&quot;; &quot;your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold&quot;.  The album is infused with &quot;the dark heart of a dream&quot;.<br />But it sees that as the &quot;price you've got to pay&quot;.  It knows that &quot;in the darkness there'll be hidden worlds that shine&quot;.  We don't have to waste our lives &quot;waiting for a moment that just don't come&quot;.  If we are willing &quot;to pay the cost&quot;, when the &quot;time is right&quot;, we can &quot;take one moment&quot; into our hands.<br />I for one, live for the &quot;things that can only be found in the Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple obviously has a ton of talent even though she doesn't seem to get much recognition for it.  I got this CD four years ago and it it is still in the front of my CD case.  Each song is meaningful.  My favorite songs are &quot;Sullen Girl&quot; &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; and &quot;The First Taste&quot;. These songs were never released on the radio but I find them much better than &quot;Criminal&quot; which is the most common.  I would definately recommend this CD to anyone who likes singer/songwriter music.  Once you read the lyrics and really listen to her music it will catch on to you.
B00005QATY|4.0|Great movie-impossible to explain why! Whether or not you appreciate the&quot;Odessey&quot; references, it's very enjoyable. I'm not a big bluegrass fan but loved the music. Great movie to own--and I'm very selective about buying videos, usually rent.Some people love, others didn't get it at first viewing. I think if you're a music fan, a nostalgia fan, or movie buff, you'll appreciate it.
0553712837|2.0|I have really enjoyed all Grisham's other books, including the out-of-character &quot;Painted House&quot;, but if this book had not been written by an already very sucessful writer, it would never have been published.  What is meant to be subtle is boring and what is meant to be indentifiable and comforting is painfully predictable.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|So why only give it four stars? <BR> I saw the movie first and went out and got the &quot;soundtrack&quot;<BR>without even checking the songs on it. The movie is incredible and the way they arranged (or should i say re-arranged)the songs in it is fresh and moving. Listen to Mr McGregor sing &quot;Your Song&quot; is an incredible experience and the &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; is both silly and wonderfully romantic. <BR> But when i buy a soundtrack of a movie that was actually billed as a musical, I expect all the songs.....not just the ones some producer decided would sell the CD better. I really missed the  arrangement of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and also Queens &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;. The orchestration in &quot;Show&quot; was worth putting it on the CD. <BR>And what about &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;? Ok, so Offenbach didn't write the goofy lyrics but its silliness make it worth putting on the so-called soundtrack.<BR>    Still, if you enjoyed the movie, get this cd. Every song on it is a hit.
B000002UAX|4.0|I was pleased with this album. It is one of my favorites. It is probaly one of the stragest ones, but the music is great. If you like their later music you will like this.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Simply the best DVD package you're likely ever to come across! The film itself looks and sounds stunning - surely one of the greats of 2001. I saw the film twice in the theater but have to say I think I enjoyed it all the more in its DVD edition. The smaller screen affords a more intimate view of this film that for all its colorful mania is, at heart, a very touching and beautifully rendered love story. Nicole Kidman is terrific as Satine, femme fatale extraordinaire. But it is Ewan Macgregor's performance that really should be singled out for multiple accolades. He is truly extraordinary.<BR>Something about the sparkle in his eye throughout lets the audience know that he is having the time of his life. I was completely swept away.<br />As far as the added features: the multi-cam option allowing the viewer to change and, in effect, &quot;re-edit&quot; the dance sequences is a helluva lot of fun.  &quot;Roxanne&quot;, perhaps the film's most spectacular tour de force comes alive again and again no matter which angle you choose.<br />My highest recommendation.
0767812166|5.0|This is definately a movie for all you hopeless romantics out there ! It is sad and hopeful at the same time. I loved Jeff Bridges in this. He and Karen Allen make a wonderful team and there is real electricity. I still cry every time I watch this.
0385505833|4.0|This story is only a days worth of reading.  With the humor, and small amout of reflection this books invokes it's worth the time and money.  I wouldn't be suprized to see this made into a movie.
0786867973|5.0|I saw this book on vacation in the UK this summer and couldn't wait for it to be published here. My husband knew and bought it for me for Christmas - a gift that he and my kids will be sure to profit  from. I have already made the winter plum cake and the italian apple and walnut cake and both were delcious as well as easy. <br />This is a great book for any home cook . For  anybody (gods or goddesses)  that wants to bake for their family and friends as an extension of their affection,  it is a delight.<br />I am already trying to decide what to bake next.......
B00003CXDZ|5.0|In all honesty (as you can see by the reviews) you will pobably either absolutely love or completely hate this movie. I LOVE it! In my opinion, the cast did an exceptional job acting AND singing. I think the musical arrangements are brilliant. Moulin Rouge takes you through every emotion. I was amazed by Ewan McGregor...especially in the last scene at the Moulin Rouge. My advice is to watch this movie with an open mind and don't take everything too seriously...if you do that you will probably love it too! (Oh and if you do not really like the first 20-30 minutes, keep watching....I think the movie changes quite a bit after that).
0385505833|2.0|This is my far John Grisham's weakest book.  He is one of my favorite authors, so I was quite disappointed when I finished reading Skipping Christmas.  Although it is a short novel, I took my time finishing it because it just wasn't a page turner as nearly all Grisham's books are.  The book's greatest downfall comes from its complete focus on the negitive aspects of Christmas.  It certainly did not put me in the Christmas spirit.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hanks truly earned his oscar.  Great story
B00003CXGP|5.0|This is one of those movies which does not only convey a story, but an atmosphere much like Fight Club, and the Matrix to an extent. The humour is not obvious; Bateman finds the shade of white on his business card more important than slaughtering coworkers. Some people's reviews have given this film a low rating because 'the film doesn't give them any deep spiritual enlightenment' or 'There's nothing here that an intelligent person who has barely scrutinised the 80s can't get, and there's no reason to sit through almost two hours of tripe to get to it'. Lighten up, it's a film, it is meant to be entertainment not a social economics lecture. I would file this DVD between Fight Club and Phil Collins Live. It is probably best viewed for the second time as the humour relies on knowledge of the story/character. In my opinion this is in my top 5 films.
B00004STPT|4.0|Track 14 (Am I Not Merciful) is almost straight out of Gorecki's Third Symphony, first movement.  Other than that, I appreciate its ghostly atmosphere.
0815411839|5.0|this is an excellent book about the life of norma jeane and then marilyn monroe.  it gives credit to her as a PERSON and WOMAN and it is not trashy at all.  the book also goes into the psyche of MM which dispels many of the myths and explains the circumstances surrounding her life.  i really enjoy donald spoto's work--i have also read his james dean book, rebel, which is very good. his style of writing is wonderful.
6305132984|4.0|Ok, the other night, I was watching the WB, and I accidentally hit channel 41, aka Turner Classic Movies. There was a scene where Tony was singing solo and I thought &quot;hey! it's an earlier version of grease!&quot; so i watched it and it was GOOD. Maria and Tony where the original parts of the movie. I cried at the ending soooo hard cause she (Maria) lost 2 men most important to her in the same night. Out of The Sharks (the Puerto Ricans) and The Jets (the Americans) i think i'd feel &quot;Cooler&quot; as a Shark! You never expect all three guys to die. WHEN WILL THE VIOLENCE END?!? (oops!...)
B00005QK3W|4.0|McCartney's brilliantly raucous collection of fifties covers on 1999's &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; was a delightful yet surprisingly festive effort. Recorded just after Linda McCartney's death, fans and critics alike were understandably befuddled by McCartney's approach to grief: rock 'n roll, baby. Shortly after his wife's death, McCartney vowed to &quot;never sing again,&quot; and any attempt at reconsidering that bitter resignation with yet another record might easily have been bloated with sorrow, darkness and self-pity. Instead, fans received one of McCartney's greatest and grittiest rock albums ever.<br />But McCartney's latest, &quot;Driving Rain,&quot; forces those who thought he was moving on to think again. He is not exactly Roger Waters, but as the album opens with the beating heart of an ominous, lonely base and the lines &quot;I tried to get over you/I tried to find something new/But all I could ever do/was fill, my time/with thoughts, of you,&quot; McCartney's capacity for pathos supercedes his stereotype as the Beatle who went on to write all those &quot;silly love songs.&quot;<br />Ironically, forty years into his recording career, McCartney has turned out one of his most necessary solo efforts. The ruefully titled &quot;Lonely Road&quot; is not nearly the album's only dirge. And so, finally, another dimension to Paul's songwriting is unmasked. The man obviously knows something more than how to write a hummable pop ditty. While a handful of wastefully bland or just plain ridiculous tunes renders the album flawed as a whole, the fulfilling dose of songs that mix compelling writing with a captivatingly morose musical atmosphere pour a few more glimmering stars onto a radiant career.<br />The album's first single, &quot;From A Lover to a Friend,&quot; is masterful in tone as well as in lyric. &quot;Let me love again,&quot; McCartney wails as though begging his late wife to release him from the bonds of lost love. Paul's pain is laid bare across our ears: &quot; How can I walk when I can't find a way/I'm in a dilemna/All I want is to tell me/You're going to take it away,&quot; he testifies as the sorrowful shuffle of drums and piano wanes.<br />&quot;Lonely Road&quot; and &quot;From A Lover to a Friend,&quot; the album's first two tracks, constitute a promising start to an album that is, ultimately, spotted with occasional brilliance, somewhat cluttered with filler such as the mawkish &quot;Driving Rain,&quot; which combines vapid lines like &quot;Something's open it's my heart/if something's missing it's when we're apart,&quot; with bland guitar and drums. An unfortunate number of tunes follow the title track's example. &quot;When I look in your eyes/I can see the sky,&quot; Paul sings on the ridiculous &quot;Tiny Bubble.&quot; Musically, &quot;She's Given up Talking&quot; is brilliantly dark and really rocks, but presents a rather insignificant portrait of a shy schoolgirl. The more I try to embrace silly songs such as these, the more I find myself asking &quot;so what?&quot; in the hollow silence with which they conclude. These underdeveloped songs once again demonstrate McCartney's knack for concocting catchy tunes squandered by prosaic writing.<br />However, rollicking numbers such as the bellicose &quot;About You&quot; and the jangling, sweet &quot;Your Way&quot; rescue &quot;Driving Rain&quot; from failure. The ten-minute epic of a finale, &quot;Rinse the Raindrops,&quot; is fantastically ambitious and laden with attitude, and the live bonus track, &quot;Freedom,&quot; represents a rather convincing attempt at social commentary by way of rock 'n roll. Essentially, a more concise album might have made &quot;Driving Rain&quot; quite a remarkable piece of work. Couldn't you say that about most any Paul McCartney album? Maybe. But the difference here is that &quot;Driving Rain&quot; adds another element to the common division between good pop-rock and silly love songs. It offers fans some of the most riveting songwriting of McCartney's career; on the album;s best tracks, the agony of loss resonates, marking the album with an unusual authenticity.gwriting of McCartney's career; on the album;s best tracks, the agony of loss resonates, marking the album with an unusual authenticity.
0783226845|5.0|great acting, moving story
B000002L82|4.0|This album deserves four stars because at the time it was released it was quite fresh and innovative, and it also represented the band's first step toward self-discovery. However, with that said, it is not in my view the band's greatest studio album; like most debuts or early efforts, it lacks the maturity that would be realized in New Order's later efforts. The lyrics are often quite obscure, and Bernard Sumner's voice is embarrasingly weak; but again, this is the result of immaturity, and not artistic failure. &quot;Age of Consent,&quot; &quot;The Village&quot; and <BR>&quot;Your Silent Face&quot; are all excellent examples of New Order's early work, while &quot;586,&quot; while not inteneded to be tuneful, is a prelude to the band's later mergings of dance-pop rhythm and technology with post-punk musical emotion. &quot;Blue Monday,&quot; is indeed a very important single, but it does seem out of place, esp. right after &quot;586,&quot; and &quot;The Beach,&quot; as the closing number of the album, frankly is a throwaway (it would have been more effective to end the LP with &quot;586&quot;). In conclusion, PC&amp;L is not the best album for first impressions, but it is a jewel for those newcomers who have already been well exposed to the band's more mature work.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|Excellent music, but audiophiles will definitely notice the distortion in a few tracks where the recording equipment was simply driven too hard. It's only in a couple places, and doesn't detract much to an otherwise excellent score. (The very emotional music at the end of &quot;The Bridge of Khazed Dum&quot; and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; are both especially notable)<br />I can only hope a more complete CD with additional music is released in the future - this CD leaves you wanting more :-)
0060278234|5.0|What I love about this book is how all the different stories and characters tie to each other somehow, though, more often than not, the characters themselves don't realize it.  The ending was brilliant... *shivers*
B000002UB3|5.0|I'm 17, and I've been a Beatles fan for 4 years.  This album is quite possibly the Beatles' best, rivled  only by the white album and sgt. pepper.  When you listen to Abbey Road, you don't skip songs (except for Maxwell's Silver Hammer, maybe).  You listen to every song, from the calm bass lines of &quot;Come Together&quot;; to Paul screaming in &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;; to the beautiful harmonies of &quot;Because&quot;; and the meddley of songs that follows.  Abbey Road is an amazing testament to the Beatles' legacy.  Buy it, and while you're at it, buy all the other beatles cds.  You'll thank me later.
0792833260|5.0|Great acting, great story.  One of my favorites
B000002LCK|3.0|I agree very much with the review of a previous contributor: New Order is a fantastic band, but this compilation carries as much bad as good. The disparity between disc 1 and disc 2 is too much to handle; the former is an overall superb collection of the bands' early-mid 80s work, and the latter is a mostly odd combination of early singles and various instrumental remixes. The extended versions of &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; are excellent, while tunes like &quot;Confusion,&quot; &quot;Subculture&quot; and &quot;Shellshock&quot; are good demonstrations of the bands ability to combine heavily produced synths and drum machines with meaningful, emotion-driven lyrics. But disc two just doesn't match in quality...it does contain some early and noteworthy singles such as &quot;Procession,&quot; but its still quite dissapointing...overall, highly recommended for fans, but just not worth the expense for newcomers
B000002BUY|5.0|This was the first Incubus CD I ever bought. It really got me into them. The truths of all the lyrics to the songs are really frightining. But it's mind expanding and it also alters the way you think. And the different sounds for each song are so funky and hard sounding that it just makes me happy.
B00003Q43A|5.0|Do not let bad reviews stop you from seeing this movie on DVD. It is the best sci-fi since Alien. War Of The Worlds with a new twist. I do not understand what causes the overpaid reviewers to condemn so many of the sci-fi films of today and praise so many of the so called &quot;movies with a message&quot;. If entertainment is what you are looking for this is a great two hours of intense sci-fi action. Once again i have discovered what the reviews say is bad, i seem to enjoy.
6304342160|5.0|Three words: Oh. My. God. This movie is just incredible. It's not that often that you come across a film that can pull you straight into it, hold you there and leave you breathless at the end, but this one does. <br />Okay, let's start at the beginning. Corky (Gina Gershon) is a lesbian ex-con who has just got out of prison. She moves into an apartment next door to Ceasar (Joe Pantoliano), a money launderer for the mob, and his girlfriend Violet (Jennifer Tilly). <br />Violet, who is perhaps not quite as heterosexual as Ceasar would like her to be, soon embarks on a fiery relationship with Corky. Gershon and Tilly have chemistry to burn; they play the sex scenes in a wonderful tongue-in-cheek manner, going for the 'fun' aspect of it. <br />This is all out of the way fairly quickly. We've established that they're a secret couple, and now the fun begins. Ceasar has $2 million dollars in his apartment which is being picked up the following day. Violet wants out and the money, and to get it she needs Corky's help. They hatch a plan and get a-thinking, but as always something goes wrong. This time? Ceasar is more intelligent than they gave him credit for.<br />Not only is the twisting plot ingenius and witty, but the whole movie is beautifully shot. Recognise Corky's gun? If the ending doesn't leave you with a huge smile on your face, nothing will. And in the end, how could anyone not love a lesbian-themed movie with the song &quot;I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You)&quot; on the soundtrack?

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I'm the type of person that always finds a lot of those albums on &quot;Top 100&quot; lists always terribly overrated. I went out and bought this album and it was actually my first Clash album.  From the first listen on, it totally blew me away.  I went about a month where I listened to it at least twice a day, I thought it was just so great.  No matter how many times I listen to it, it still sounds fresh and new every time.  There is just something so MAGICAL about this album, you can't really describe it, you just have to get the album and you'll instantly know what everyone is talking about.  If you like music, any kind of music at all, do yourself a favor and go out and get this masterpiece.
B00003CXXS|4.0|What a Sequel Should be. A fun movie that did not Bog down in to  Plot details. If you are looking for Depth go elsewhere, looking for a morality lesson look elsewhere. Looking for a fun captivating movie with Specatacular Special effects this is for you!! The Only problem I had with the Movie is that the Ending kind of fell apart and became cheesy. Otherwise it is a great roller coaster ride.
B000059TPN|5.0|One of my favorite action movies, it has humor as well
0385505833|1.0|The joke is on the reader.  John Grisham shows how secular, shallow, and superficial Christmas has become by serving up a shallow, one-dimensional, formula story.  I read this book in one sitting at the airport, I can't really say it was a complete waste of time, I could have been shopping for Christmas presents for my friends that don't really need or want the gifts, that would have been a complete waste of time.  I can see this becoming the latest Disney &quot;formula&quot; movie that will be popular and make quite a bit of money for the all-consuming entertainment giant, as it has for Grisham and publisher.  Just think of all the people buying last minutes gifts for Christmas, and picking up this book because it looked &quot;Cute&quot;.  I won't recommend this book to anyone, but I give 5 stars to the author and publisher for this most intelligent and well-devised &quot;can't lose&quot; marketing scheme.  The joke is on us, lesson learned well.  Christmas has become nothing but a way for the retailers to grab as much money from us as possible.  I had hopes that this book would end with some deep thought or meaning for the holidays, but no such luck.  Next time I pick up something to read in the airport, it'll be a Reader's Digest, at least there you get shallow stories and jokes.
0440180295|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Vonnegut, and it is one of the best books I have read by any author, although after having read a few other books by him, it is certainly his best work. <br />The book is set mostly in WWII, but it also flashes around to time periods after the war. The flow of the story is similar to the movie \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but the flashbacks are in a logical order that makes sense throughout the book. <br />It is mostly a serious story, but the author has the knack for smacking the reader with some witty comment or antecdote that will have you laughing [...], but makes strong social commentary at the same time. He writes in a way that is very matter-of-fact and he tells it like it is, often giving the reader a new perspective on this world.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I cant decide whether i like this album or not. Britney has matured, yes, but is she a mature artist? No. She's no 'the next Madonna', but she doesnt suck majorly. Some of her songs are kinda pointless, like Anticipating. I cant stand that song. But, i like What it's like to be me. I have to say that it's not the best album, and you certainly are NOT missing out if you dont have it.
0783235968|5.0|a truly great story, one that can be watched over and over and not get boring
B00003CXTG|2.0|With this over-polished, commercial representation of American history, director Michael Bay and his sponsor Jerry Bruckheimer have given us an 'event' picture that is, in typical Bay and Bruckheimer fashion, a mindless, artistically arid film that runs twice as long as its material deserves.  An event as important as the attack on Pearl Harbor is done an injustice when its inherent gravity and drama is stuck in the backseat in favor of a trite, cliched love triangle saturated with gloss and bloated self-importance.<br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; works for the 30 minute sequence in the film's  middle when the Japanese attack, but is mind-numbingly bad for its other 150 minutes, when all attention is placed on the shoulders of the picture perfect, overly beautiful triangle of Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale.  It is all predictable and shallow, and filled with dialogue that is as original and intelligent as a loaf of Wonder Bread.<br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; fails as history, falls flat as romance and drama, and lacks even a drop of intelligence or creativity.  It is well photographed, and technically competent, especially in the attack sequence; but on the whole, it is a monstrous, over-inflated failure.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is the latest in a series of works that have been progressivly better (I own them all) by what I consider to be the greatest power metal band out there right now.  To be completely fair, I'll go over the eextensive &quot;good's&quot; and few &quot;bad's&quot; of Nightfall in Middle Earth.<br />Pros: Where do I begin?  Blind Guardian has suceeded in creating a heavy metal sound that is completely unique and unbelievable.  Excellent musicainship by all members of the band, excellent songwriting, and an amazing sense of fantasy atmosphere make this an epic metal masterpiece.  Andre Olbrich is a great guitarist.  His solos are very well planned out and mainly consist of pre-written melodies instead of improviation.  The sound of Olbrich's piercing guitar, whether it is playing another catchy elf-melody or complimenting the masterful vocals of Hansi Kursch, will be the sound most will associate with &quot;Nightfall...&quot;  Kursch is, hands-down, the best metal vocalist in action right now.  Many will not like this, but he is better than Bruce and Rob, in my opinion anyway.  His voice has an absolutely amazing range!  On top of that, and unlike most power metal vocalists, he manages to give his voice a very scratch, gruff tone that is perfect for metal.  There are also a varied range of vocals on this album; there are times when Hansi will go for a much softer, cleaner tone when appropriate, and nearly every memorable chorus he is accompanied by a back up group of singers, creating a large chorus-like effect.  The songwriting is phenomenal.  Nearly every moment of every song is catchy and great, with never a dull moment.  The utilizaton of acoustic guitars and keyboards/effects creates and amazing sense of grandeur and wonder that is majestic, beautiful, and metal. <br />Cons: I have little to complain about...although the drumming is excellent, I don't particularly like the way the drums are mixed.  I wish I could hear the kick more.  It kind of gets hidden behindall the singing, lead guitar, and effects.  The same goes for the rhythm guitar.  Althought the spotlight is rightfuly on Olbrich, there are times when the second guitar is nearly obsolete.  The largest negative about this album are the interludes between almost every single song.  I know they are trying to tell the story of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Simarillion, but I could really do without the spoken word tracks and sound effects of fighting.  Some are completly random and make almost no sense to an outsider to the novel like myself.  <br />The bottom line: A power metal fan can't go wrong with this.  Neither can any metal fan.  This is just amazing.  If you enjoy this album, I strongly suggest &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side.&quot;
0446677450|5.0|Well written, easy to read book written in a parable form of stories from the author's youth.  The author's father was a successful person who worked and spent money like the majority of americans.  Ultimately, like most of us, he didn't have a lot left over to show for all of his years of earnings.  The author was taken under the wing of his friend's father who was rich.  Through instruction and examples he shows the author why we get caught in the rat race and why we are conditioned to not question it.<br />This books makes you ask a lot of questions about why we make the decisions we do about careers and money.  Our society trains us to get trapped in this work - spend - work - get a raise - spend more - bigger house - work harder cycle.  The book defines the true meaning of an assett and a liability.  The author made his money through real estate.  American's view their home as their biggest assett, when it really is their biggest liability.  The true definition of an Assett is that it makes you money or atleast pays for itself.  Our need for a home in that &quot;exclusive&quot; neighborhood and all the trappings that come with it, can rob us of the chance for financial independence.  Take the advice of this book: Don't get caught in the rat race, set up your income stream and accumulate your money first then you can truly enjoy those rewards and not fear losing them.<br />This book really made me think.
0783225733|5.0|Great acting and a suspenseful, action-packed story
0345404475|5.0|Phillip K. Dick wrote some really mind bendingly weird books and this is one of them.  It is good science fiction that reflects the absurdity of our society.
0385505833|5.0|I thought it was an unusal work for John. It was cute and sweet.  I enjoyed it but somehow the title is missing something.  I wouldn't of called it skipping Christmas
B00003CX8J|4.0|The same as the comic book X-Men with slight variation.  Great movie and well-written but a bit disappointing because it was too short.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a great book. There, like most good books, comes a time when you can't put it down. It is about a group of children who find a mysterious mirror in their uncle's house. Then, the young Lucy steps into the wardrobe. Soon, the White Witch decieves characters, and tries to keep the everlasting winter.<BR>This story is very good to read and is the opposite of boring. If you like this book I recommend 'The Hobbit' by J.R.R. Tolkien. Happy Reading :)
B00005QK3W|2.0|I can't believe a talent of Paul's magnitude, the man who was 1/4 of the most influential band of all time, the man who gave us some of the 70's best pop/rock would turn out something even remotely close to this 'effort'. The majority of this sounds like outtakes that didn't make the rest of his albums. 'Driving Rain' isn't in the same league as 'Flaming Pie' and especially 'Off the Ground'. It's as if he's trying to appeal to the new age, non-melodic loving individuals who are RESPONSIBLE for making the Billboard Top 40 what it is today and has been the last 5 years. Only a die hard fan and perhaps a McCartney family member would find musical value in this release.
B00005RYQO|5.0|I am very offended by the number of reviews that make this sound like a female cannot enjoy this movie.  My best chick friend and I LOVE this film.  We've seen it...well...an obssessive number of times.  It's fun; it's fast; it's got hot men; it's got good music.  Yes, there's some fine ladies in it too.  Why does that mean that women won't like this movie? or just want to see Vin Diesel without his shirt on- BUY THIS movie!
B00004YA66|5.0|You will be at the edge of your seat from beginning to the end.  One of the best action films I've watched in a long time.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This is one of the few films of 2001 that kept me rivited the whole way through at the pics. Most action films these days seem, well, all the same but TFATF was a little different. Unlike Gone in 60 seconds, it had more cars, a faster pace. OK, the story was the usual, an under cover police plot but that's not what the film is really about. It was for all the play station and GT car fans out their. If you can sit and enjoy without picking wholes in the flimsy plot, then this is a must see film.
B00005AQE8|5.0|THIS CD IS THE BEST PAC CD EVER. TUPAC WAS THE BEST LYRICIST EVER AND NO ONE CAN COMPARE TO HIS UNIQUE STYLE. THIS ALBUM SHOWS HOW TALENTED TUPAC WAS. THE BEST TRACKS ARE \\"ALL ABOUT YOU\\",\\"GOT MY MIND MADE UP\\",\\"HOW DO YOU WANT IT\\",\\"2 OF AMERIKAZ MOST WANTED\\" \\"LIVE GOES ON\\"....DAM THE WHOLE CD IS TIGHT. IF YOU DON'T GOT IT GET IT. FOR TRUE PAC FANS YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD.
B00005R8DB|5.0|On Brilliant Corners, the music was as challenging as anything he had done in the past, but now the public seemed to be ready for what he was doing. Many consider this the album to be a masterpiece, and rightly so. Max Roach's drumming on the title track sounds great--tight, and full of impact. &quot;Pannonica&quot; made its debut on this album, and features Monk on both piano and celeste at the same time. Originally recorded on the spur of the moment to fill space on the album, the tender &quot;I Surrender, Dear&quot; sounds like you're right there in the studio. &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; is a bit sloppy, but Roach's tympani playing stands out much more than it did on the OJC version. The only problem I noticed here is a click at the beginning of the title track. Aside from that, it sounds fabulous.

0131103628|5.0|This is THE definition of the C programming language. I read this book three times when I originally entered the Unix industry segment. It is both a tutorial and a reference; the first half is illustration and example, and the second half is the actual ANSI standard. The first half also includes homework assignments! This book doesn't come with finished programs; you'll actually have to write your own. Kernighan and Ritchie do spend time teaching the idioms that you will most commonly encounter in C source code. If you're learning C for the first time this would be best supplemented by a more straightforward study book, preferably one that includes whole programs that compile and run without modification. If you are a professional C programmer, or a professional in technical support, this book is a mandatory cornerstone of your library.
0618002227|5.0|Thsi is a great book for people 11 and up. This book becomes part of you because the characters are so real you feal like you know them. Its is written well. Just get through the first 50 pages or so and it satarts getting good.
B00000099Y|2.0|I first heard about Tool when they released Lateralus and someone told me about Schism. I downloaded it and loved it, the same person told me to get Sober and Stinkfist. I love them too. Other people have told me to get Aenima because it was better than Lateralus. I bought this a couple days ago and listened to it a day later, I'm listening to it now so I can review it.<br />I downright hate this. I started off excited about hearing other stuff like Stinkfist, but was extremely dispointed. If Tool releases a pure intrumental version of this, then I'd like it more for it's artistic value. Unfortunately I'd have to listen to Maynard say f**k every ten seconds if I want to hear the music. Most of these songs I can't imagine being played at a concert. I know you Tool fans out there think I'm an idiot for starting with those first three songs I mentioned. I actually agree, and now to piss off you Tool-fans out there even more, I'm going to sell this to a friend of mine for $10. Even though I still lose money, I think it was worth it to find out how Tool really is...
B00000GJ2B|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese was born and raised in New York City.  It was fitting that the film that launched him as a director, &quot;Mean Streets,&quot; was about the tough side of the tough, competitive city where he grew up, in which the title said it all.  Scorses moves back into that same familiar territory in his 1980 jackpot triumph, &quot;Raging Bull.&quot;  The black and white photography is perfect for the subject matter, a tough, mob-dominated atmosphere and the engrossing character study of a neighborhood product who fights his way to the middleweight championship of the world.<br />Jake La Motta succeeded to a champonship with his successful in the ring fighting, but this film reveals that there was a whole lot more fighting within his psyche and with those with whom he interacted outside the boxing ring, and those experiences were anything but successful.  Robert De Niro gives a masterful performance as the troubled fighter who is riddled by paranoia, especially regarding his beautiful wife.  After an unsuccessful marriage La Motta is in heaven initially when he marries Vicky, the beautiful blonde from the neighborhood and the object of the fantasies of the area's men.  Cathy Moriarity does an excellent job as the tormented wife who refuses to let her paranoiac husband walk over her.  <br />La Motta is driven by an irrational jealousy concerning the beautiful Vicky.  When she merely mentions that Tony Janiro, an upcoming La Motta opponent, is a &quot;good looking kid,&quot; the paranoiac fighter accuses her of romantic designs on his future opponent, and wonders aloud if she has been sexually involved with him.  At another point he accuses his brother, played capably by Joe Pesci, of having sex with his wife.  When Pesci tells him that the question is too sick and disgusting to  answer, De Niro angrily attacks his brother.  When Vicky seeks to intervene, Vicky, along with Pesci's wife, played by Theresa Saldana, seek to pull De Niro off Pesci, he strikeshis wife.<br />One of the interesting aspects of De Niro's Oscar-winning performance is the way he actually packed on the pounds to play the overeating, boozing La Motta in his post-boxing career days.  La Motta looms as every bit the tragic figure he was in his fighting days, but in a different respect.  Now he is a bloated, frustrated nightclub owner in Miami seeking to entertain boozed patrons in 1957 with lines that fall well short of the standards of Miami's most famous comedian, Jackie Gleason.  He is finally revealed in New York in 1964 delivering the same tired, unfunny lines while introducing the busty stripper with whom he is romantically involved long after Vicky has left him.  He has a teary-eyed reunion with Pesci, whom he sees walking out of a New York City liquor store.  <br />This hard-nosed film packs a solid punch.  Scorsese stages the fight scenes with a lyrical, poetic style rather than aiming for the kind of gripping realism which prevailed in fight films such as &quot;The Setup&quot; and &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me,&quot; solid hits, both of which were directed by Robert Wise, and that also merit attention.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is an excellent follow-up to their self titled album. With Serj's vocals, Daron's guitar, Shavo's bass, and John's drumming, SOAD is by far my favorite band ever. Serj's voice control is absolutely incredible. He can sound like a ...... off grown man, but a second later, you could swear he is a little choir boy. He demonstrates this voice control in songs like Forest, or Psycho. SOAD is simply an amazing band. The current singles off of Toxicity are ATWA, and Chop Suey. They are currently working on a music video for ATWA to be directed by Shavo. I (and many others) expect to see very much more incredible music from this Lebbanese- American band. Way to go, SOAD!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Who needs a critic. All they've ever done is bad mouth movies I've ever liked. I enjoyed A.I. immensly and can't wait for the dvd to come out. I enjoyed the story, the special effects and just wanted to add my two cents. See it and bring the hankies.
B00005R62N|5.0|When I first listened to Unleashed in the East I thought it was a bit monotonous and similar to other hard rock/heavy metal that I'd heard - probably because the style here has so often been imitated.  Then after a few years I found myself listening to it more often and more closely until I realized I was hooked.  Now, I consider it one of my favorite albums.  Here's a short list of reasons why:<br />1) The energy and power of the music, which is backed by fantastic riffs and leads that burn a hole in your consciousness.  2) Incredible musicianship.  This includes the previously mentioned guitar work as well as the surrealistically talented Rob Halford on lead vocals and the drumming, which far outclasses that on later releases by Priest.  3) Lyrics that match the complexity and force of the music.  4) The quality of the recording.  The sound has a depth that captures the feel of a concert hall in the way it fills and expands in your ears. <br />Like many other great albums, Unleashed in the East transports you into it's own atmosphere and keeps you riveted by it's intensity.  In the end, you feel as if you've been on a journey.  One that you want to take over and over again.  There's a subtlety to it that might take some repeat listenings to notice.  This includes various little effects and noises as well as the countless twists and turns in the music.  Overall it's a disc that creeps up on you gradually until all the sudden you don't know what hit you.  So put this one in your pipe and smoke it.  You'll soon wonder what the point of living is without it (to paraphrase Running Wild).
630529142X|1.0|This is a dog with fleas!
B00005QB9A|5.0|I saw this movie just last night on cable and I was thoroughly blown away. Tim Roth's portrayal of the tragic pianist 1900 is breath taking. A man with an limitless innate gift for playing piano who can't bear to leave the ship he calls home. The duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton was for me the highpoint of the piece. Just beautiful.
B00005JKT8|5.0|This movie is definately for the romantic comedy fans. Meg Ryan does an outstanding job portraying a bussiness woman working her way to the top with her &quot;crazy&quot; ex-boyfriend still living in her building. He claims to have found a hole in time, and his mysterious and extremely attractive guest (Hugh Jackman) claims to be from 1876. With his romantic charm, chivalry and respectful manner, he changes the lives of three New Yorkers while unknowingly changing history for himself. Although this is definately a chick-flick, it is one that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to leave theaters with their head in the clouds!
B00005MP58|5.0|I wanted to get this dvd because all I had of Pride and Prejudice was a crappy 6 hour tape of it off tv but I was worried when I read all the complaints about it and when I got it a couple months ago, I found it to be absolutely fine. I LOVE it... I love all the little extra scenes that were probably cut from tv. I did not notice anything wrong... i thought the colour was just fine. I don't know... maybe it was because I never got the first dvd, but I definitely recommend it. Colin Firth is incredible and so is the story. I am loving it!!!
B00005U122|5.0|I was blown away by the clarity of the picture and the setlist. This is a must for any Floyd and Roger Waters fan. This was my first concert DVD purchase and I couldn't be more please with the whole production.
B00004YW6I|4.0|this is the first Pj cd I've listened to. I always wanted to listen to her but I always put it off. My sister had a copy of stories of the city so I poped it into my cd player. &quot;a place called home&quot; caught my intrest and kept it there. Other songs on the cd were a real joy to listen to and I'd name them for ya but I don't have the track listing with me. I love this album and it's under heavy rotation in my player. Pick up Pj. She's an amazing musical artist with outstanding emotion.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I had the pleasure of watching Moulin Rouge over the holiday weekend. (The beginning was a little slow.) It has been a while since I've seen a musical that actually kept me captivated. Moulin Rouge is not just a love story, it's funny, and rather entertaining.  I would highly recommend it for all to see, in fact I have.  Again, don't get discouraged by the beginning, it will make sense in the end.  Enjoy!
B00005AAFS|5.0|I've been a fan of Rammstein for a while when I heard they were working on a new CD. I waited for nearly a year for it to come out. I bought it the day it was released. Listening to it in my car on the way home, I was awestruck! Rammstein had evolved into a musical monster! Now there are guitar solos and complicated drum beats! The guitars are featured more and Till's voice is erie as ever! It is by far the heavist, most musical Rammstein CD ever! It is my new favorite. If you have any intrest in hard rock, buy this CD. You will thank me.
0060194995|5.0|It's novels like this that make literature so beautiful. Harper Lee writes one of the best, most touching novels you'll ever read. I absolutely loved it....and to think I would have never read it unless I was forced to in school. This is what makes us so happy to have English classes that force us to read books that we think we won't like. =) &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a beautiful piece of literature, but you have to allow yourself to get into it. Like most other books, you have to get through the humdrum of the beginning in order to get into it. This novel follows the escapades of 12-year-old Jem and his little sister Scout in the 1930's. What they experience in a short period of time will change their lives forever. There isn't much to say about this novel. It's heartrending, touching, and thoroughly engaging, and the writing is among the best I've ever seen in one novel. Harper Lee deserves all the recognition she receives for this moving account on living life and growing up. I definitely recommend that you buy this novel, but the only way you can come to love it so much is if you are patient with Harper Lee's deep writing style and if you allow yourself to feel the human emotions of the characters. It's a beautiful story with a lot of meaning and depth. Well worth every piece of your money, that's for sure!
0446677450|3.0|Having just been this book a bestseller, when I happened to read it I was very curious about the subject. But I have been quite disappointed by its content. Nothing more than a general autobiography, with some use of elementary economics terms (which can be a bit useful to non-english readers), the general level of the book is comparable to what you can find in many web sites. Not a hint can be found about the real problems and difficulties you meet setting up an activity of your own, and the text deals meanly with what people knows yet. However, I have assigned three stars because it is an easily readable item, and its general meaning, whatever trivial, is undoubtedly true. In a chapter, the author affirms to be a &quot;best-seller&quot;, and not a &quot;best-writer&quot;. I do agree with that statement.
6304698658|5.0|This may be blasphemous, but I think this film ranks right up underneath Monty Python's Holy Grail.  It's just not officially Christmas unless I've watched this film.  I'm NOT a big Chevy Chase fan, but he's perfect in this film.  It's impossible to select my favorite scene - the Squirrel?  The unfortunate cat?  The sled?  The turkey?  The pool fantasy?  &quot;Bit of a nip in the air?&quot;  I can't decide.  <br />But for me, anyway, my favorite line is easy to pick. Beverly DeAngelo:  &quot;I don't know what to say, dear, except that it's Christmas -- and we're ALL miserable!&quot;  (You have to be there, to understand.)  <br />Oh! And be sure to take a close look at what Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid are drinking out of when they drink the eggnog -- a little reward for fans of National Lampoon's Family Vacation.  <BR>Get this movie, and enjoy!
6305508550|4.0|The 4 stars is an average of a 5-star movie and a 3-star DVD. It would have been spectacular to have included the animated Milton shorts as well. Perhaps this was a licensing issue.<br />On to the movie: EXCELLENT. If you've ever worked in an office, especially in a tech career, you'll be able to relate. All the characters and the plot line integrate seamlessly into one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Mike Judge is a genius, and one can see why both of his full-length animated shows were complete hits (Beavis &amp; Butthead and King of the Hill). Another thing that I really thought was great is that this is set in Texas rather than your run-of-the-mill California tech company. Adds a little cultural flair to it, in my opinion. <br />This movie will completely sum up all your feelings about bosses, &quot;happy people&quot;, consultants and damned office equipment! You will definitely NOT be disappointed. This is a must-own movie, with almost infinite rewatchability.
0441003257|5.0|... and I'd like to add something to my previous statment:  If you hate a book, by all means it's your right to say so and why, but it's in general really unecessary to continue by insulting everyone who might have enjoyed the book.  The focus should be commenting on the work, not on trying to denigrate people you don't know to make yourself seem cooler.  Thanks, and happy reading.
B00005OM4N|4.0|You have to admit...its a funky CD that you can just bug out to. MY FAVE IS &quot;BOYS&quot;. You can workout to her CD, its one of those move ur body CD's. I am not a britney fan, but I think her new cd is ok.
B000051VWW|2.0|This is the first Sade album I ever bought.  I enjoyed all of the 20-something songs that were and still are being played on jazz stations today, but this album has no radio hits.  &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; is a lack-luster, tedious album to listen to straight through.  Although Sade is one of the pioneers of &quot;quiet storm&quot;, this album is no where near that category.  It has no real beats, no catchy melodies, and no Stuart Matthewman guitar/sax solos.  That doesn't mean that the whole album is a flop though.  There are some songs that I found noteworthy- &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Immigrant&quot;, and &quot;Every Word&quot;, but the other ones had no spark, especially &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot;.

B00005QG9J|5.0|It is a great album. Its one of those albums that you can just put it in and leave it to please your ears. They are different and brandon has that voice that you can't deny. Trust me, it's great. Relaxing songs and there are songs that you just want to get up and dance and SING!!!!
B00005JKHP|2.0|the best STAR TREK films are parts 2,4,6, GENERATIONS &amp; FIRST CONTACT.  parts 3,5, &amp; INSURRECTION weren't so good.  and so does this 1st chapter with kirk and crew.  so i have seen the director's cut of THE MOTION PICTURE on dvd recently.  new special effects have been added that we haven't seen in 1979.  when the film came out december of that year, the movie wasn't even finished according to its director robert wise.  the &quot;finished&quot; product is improved in the fx dept but this is still 1 slooooooowwww ride on the enterprise.  lotta talk, miniscule humor and very tiny action.  wise wasn't a wise choice for this film.  to me, he was never good in making scifi flicks; 1971's THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN  was another snoozer from him.  then came THE WRATH OF KHAN with a better director, nicholas meyer and the film series blasted off from there.  let's see what occurs with the newest trek movie, NEMESIS out late 2002 directed by stuart baird (U.S. MARSHALS).
630518299X|4.0|I am not a fan of Jim Carrey and I find many of his movies too over-the-top to be worth watching (just watch &quot;Me, Myself and Irene&quot; to know what I mean). But Truman Show proves to be the exception to the rule. Intended as a comedy, it turns out to be rather thought provoking and moving. The story follows Truman Burbanks, a 30 year old man who has never left his home town. Unbeknown to him, he lives in a giant studio that is visible from space, was adopted at birth by a movie corporation and is viewed daily by millions around the globe.<br />In the 21st century, television viewers in general have reached the point where they are fascinated by individual lives, a trait as old as gossip. Watch Big Brother if you don't believe me. Truman Show is impressive in that it portrays this new trend three or four years before it emerges (it was released in 1998). TV junkies and couch potatoes have an infatuation with watching other people run their lives, hence Big Brother, Survivor and such other series.<br />Personally, I find this a huge waste of time and was not surprised at the recent drop in consumer spending (and hence economy strength) in First World countries - they're all watching TV! Fortunately for the UK and US, Christmas came and everyone suddenly went out buying presents, so the economy was saved.<br />But getting back to the movie, Truman eventually begins to discover what's happening due to some freakish accidents. A studio light falls from the sky, his car radio changes frequency and begins to follow him around. And there's the mysterious Sylvia who manages to spoil the studio's profits by nearly telling Truman what's up and thus making him more inquisitive.<br />The Show is brilliant, and definitely a worthwhile watch. It is funny in parts, more sobering in others. We realise how completely oblivious Truman is to his world (initially, at least) and, for those who've never left home, makes us wonder if WE might be a Truman (figuratively of course)
B000002O96|4.0|The First track, &quot;Long distance Call&quot; is a classic. The others are kind of weaker repeats , but the whole thing rocks.
6305364613|3.0|this movie must be reviewed as two separate movies. i can think of no other way that would do justice.<BR><BR> FIRST: as a remake of romeo and juliet. as a fanatic of romeo and juliet, and especially the 1968 zefirelli version, i absolutely hated this movie. the scenes were twisted, cut, changed and defiled until it was almost unrecognizable. favorite characters were dropped (such as the nurse who was such an important and lovable character, while in this version she is a one dimensional character who cannot speak english) or altered in horrible ways. (never have i ever pictured mercutio as a black drag queen) the roles were horrifically miscast for the difficult dialogue. this is most apparent in the first scene where a fight breaks out at a gas station. it's like watching people speaking a foreign language that they have been taught to say phonetically but have no idea what the words mean. they try their pathetic little hearts out but the end result is cringe-worthy. as a final opinion: i will never ever forgive baz luhrmann for [...messing] with the balcony scene. not ever.<BR> <BR> SECOND: as a movie of its own. visually spectacular and nothing short of what we've come to expect of baz luhrmann and his fanciful eye for the exotic, the beautiful, the ethereal. let me put it to you this way: even cosidering the above opinions i will still buy this movie and try not cringe-- just so i can see the incredible images he creates. the soundtrack is decent and the acting is mostly passable, the best in the bunch being claire danes as juliet. i may be biased, however, by my firm belief that leonardo dicraprio should never be cast in any role with the possible exception of the portrayal of a buttrock. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of the great american buttrock, i will attempt to explain. in school plays, when you have too many actors and not enough parts, someone will have to provide scenery by getting down on all fours, with their butt in the air, and havea sheet put over them so that they may be mistaken for a rock. voila, la buttrock.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Undeniably the worst film with John Travolta since he made Look Who's Talking.  Not even seeing Halle Berry's nudity can make up for the one and a half hours of my life that I wasted watching this movie and I will never get back again.  Another prime example of Hollywood spending more money on advertising and hype than in the actual production of a good movie.  This is the future folks.  Realize it and have fear.  <br /> This movie looks like it was made straight out of the cookie cutter of other thrillers seen before.  Five minutes into the flick and Travolta's character has already given away the ending.  Nonsence cyber babble permeate the entire film in an age where lots of people know enough about computer technology to recognize the stink of baloney when they're hearing it.  Throughout the film we're given the gratuitous nudity, explosions, and gun play that Hollywood thinks is necessary to draw people into the theater.  I understand that in an effort to make money a movie companies tend to play to the lowest common denominator.  I say that the best we can do is stay away from them in droves to show them we aren't as dumb as they think we are.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I think that Star Wars: Episode 1 was a great movie and the DVD is even better. I love all the special features and Jar Jar is no more annoying than rap or alot of the music today.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This cartoonish 'film' was even edited in foreign markets, to increase sales. In Japan, Japanese involement in this attack was toned down in the movie! This is truly disgusting, a slap in the face to veterans and to history. FDR gets up from his wheelchair? I think he's rolling in his grave.
6304698658|4.0|I do like this film but it is in no way in the same field as the first movie and european vacation. If you liked the first two movies I would suggest renting this first before buying a copy.
0553106635|5.0|I have, in my 20 something years, read a lot of books, including all the Sci-fi/fantasy greats like Feist, Eddings, Williams, Tolkien, Herbert to name a few and also classics like Dumas, in my opinion, however, George R R Martin surpasses them all.  I read each book in the series in one sitting and actually found myself so engrossed with the characters that I was sub-consciously thinking about them in my sleep and whilst I was at work.  I don't know how he does it, yet he makes it seem so easy, there are very few clear cut good/bad characters, every one is a shade of gray and somewhat flawed - this makes you truly care about what happens to them.  This is a an epic classic in the making, I truly believe that if the entire series was written 10 years ago and had the time to be read by a wider audience - it would have beaten lord of the Rings to the coveted title of 'book of the last century'.  If you have yet to read the books in this series - do not delay - this is literature at it's finest and only the most uptight snobs would lable this series a genre piece.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Buy the explicit version, not the clean version. The swearing is very light, so go ahead and buy your kids the explicit version!<br />Now that that's out of the way, lets get on with the review:<br />I seem to find this a very enjoyable CD, but I;m not going to call it a punk CD, nor a pop CD, all &quot;im going to say is that I enjoy it. I always thought this was the most imaginative Blink 182 album, but not quite their best.<br />1. Dumpweed- 10/10- My personal favorite song on the album!<br />2. Don't Leave Me- 8/10- Very catchy tune, but it's way too short and has repetitive lyrics!<br />3. Aliens Exist- 7/10- Gets old really fast!<br />4. Going Away To College- 10/10- Very imaginative song! A nice soothing switch!<br />5. What's My Age Again?- 10/10- One of the best songs on the album. Very different from anything they've ever written!<br />6. Dysentery Gary-10/10- Very catchy and funny!<br />7. Adam's Song- 9/10- Very emotional song, but gets old fast!<br />8. All The Small Things- 7/10- Get's old, but doesn't have the emotion of Adam's Song<br />9. The Party Song- 10/10-Another one of my favorites! Fast and funny!<br />10. Mutt- 7/10- Pretty slow and boring<br />11. Wendy Clear- 9/10- Different...very punkish....<br />12. Anthem- 10/10- Very funny...and catchy!
0446608955|5.0|Alright..I admit it. I would have never stumbled over the THOUGHT of buying this book if I hadn't seen the previews to the movie on TV. This morning, my mother and I went to Marshall Fields and I ran into the bookstore. I was trying to find a good book, but I couldn't think of one. Running my fingers through endless Stephen King novels, I thought of Message in a Bottle. I thought to myself, if this was taken from a book, the author must be very gifted. I automatically thought of the &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; preview I saw on TV and remembered it was also adapted from a book. I asked the sales clerk to help me find it and within 2 minutes I was at the counter, about to pay for the book. Alright..the book wasn't short and down to the point. But that's what I LOVED about it! It went right down to the little details and you truly felt like you were  inside the book, watching everything happen. I just finished the book about 5 minutes ago, realizing that I needed 2 tissues to drag myself to the end. Now I really can't wait for the movie! &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; has now become my favorite book. I am not saying that everyone will like this book. Maybe I liked it because I myself am young and maybe one day I can relate to it..everyone has their opinion. You just heard mine. If you think you might not like it, borrow it from the library. Coincedentally, I found out that Nicholas Sparks (the author) wrote &quot;Message in a Bottle.&quot; What a small world..
0783225970|5.0|Al Pacino, as wooden as ever in Godfather and even in recent fare like Any Given Sunday, casts those doe eyes to terror in the drug trade in this classic.  Perhaps John Travolta feels Pacino was great in the Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon (see the intro to Swordfish, the movie), I disagree more strongly that a pungent fart under grandma's hand-knitted afghan.  Pacino is typically stilted, depending more on icy stares and yelling than on true acting. Can anyone recall Al playing a gentle role, similar let's say to Hoffman in Rainman or Midnight COwboy?  I thnik not.  But alas, the plot is so provocative and tight in this epic drug film, with tension at several plateaus in the movie, that the writing overcomes Pacino's flatness.  A sordid tale, needs to be watched in a single long viewing, of the devisiveness of society in 1980s America, where a star is born if he can make it in petty crimes and trafficking.  5 stars, despite Al.
B000003TAR|5.0|This album is excellent, every song in its own right is exceptional. It my opinion it just pips Nevermind, Muddy Banks and MTV unplugged to become the best Nirvana album; and one of the best albums ever made.
B0000024K1|5.0|Goundbreaking... anyone within 20 miles of any major city must recall well the siren repetitions on this CD/tape from the early 90s bellowing from every hip-hop boom box in town. It was the new mantra of rap; fast, furious and funny.  Pointed yet not preachy.  We all know that Chuck D and Flav bombed out after this pinnacle album (save for Fight the Power for Lee's movie as a single), but in this breakout, Public Enemy truly hits new pavement, tread rollnig, raunchy and raw and speedy and spicy.  5 stars
0385505833|3.0|I've never read Grisham before. I bought this because I like a good Christmas read. My ten year old and my wife breezed through it before I could get to it. Overall, I liked the message Grisham is sending in this book. I think we all get tired of the insane  commercialism and obligations of Christmas. I could easily aspire to Luther Krank's agenda for avoiding it all this one year. As a reader, one does feel sympathy toward the Kranks and hopes they can pull it off. Their spolied daughter is the one that makes you sick in the end. I guess I did not give it more stars because of the creative possibilities that could have been explored if Grisham went another route. It is a very readable book no matter. Buy it to day at Amazon.Com!
B00005JKT8|2.0|I'm really sorry to be the lone voice of dislike, here, but this movie had no color. It was almost like Ryan was saying, &quot;The studio is making me do another one of these stupid romantic comedies.&quot; She obviously didn't want to be tHere, whcih made it really hard for the audience to enjoy viewing her performance. Because she was so colorless, negative, and almost bored with her performance, there was really no chemistry between her and Jackman. He did a wonderful job, as did Schribner as her nutty ex-boyfriend. even her brother lit up the screen. Unfortuately, chemistry is the main ingredient in any romanitc comedy, and this one had no fizzle at all. I could have walked out halfway through, and never missed a thing.
B00005OM4K|3.0|A longtime CCR and John Fogerty fan, I asked my friends to give me this box set for Christmas.  Its comprehensiveness is impressive, but I'm sorry to say the sound quality falls far short of what I would consider the archival recording this magnificent American band deserves.  The problem is what I take to be azimuth misalignment in playing back the original tapes, or whatever the analog source they used to master these CDs.  The result is the distorted \\"swooshing\\" cymbals you hear when such a problem exists, and it mars many of the tracks here, including virtually every cut on Green River.  I DO NOT remember the original LPs having this problem, or even the first generation of CCR CDs of the original albums. I therefore have to say that I am very disappointed with this box set and hope that Fantasy will go back to the original tapes and try this remastering thing again, until they get it right.  Otherwise [it] is a high price to pay for the nice CCR illustrated booklet included, containing essays which have already appeared in previous reissues.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's now 2010, and recent comments attesting to first-class sound suggest that Fantasy, these days under the more enlightened management of Concord Music Group, may have remastered these discs and fixed the problems I alluded to back in 2002.  If so, please disregard my review.  If you order the box and do still hear \\"swooshing\\" cymbals, however, you'll know what I was talking about...
B00003CY0V|3.0|After seeing Kate &amp; Leopold in the theatres, I rented this DVD to get more of Hugh Jackman!  Well it certainly delivered, but I must admit that if I weren't a H.J. fan, I wouldn't have enjoyed it much.  He's really good but Travolta just didn't deliver and Barry was slimy!  The best parts were seeing Jackman in a towel hitting golf balls and trying to pass his &quot;test&quot; with the blond's head in his lap.  The bus thing was too stupid to even believe.  Given all this, I still watched it twice.
B00005QW9V|5.0|Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It has great casting, an extremely good story, and good musical performances as well. I enjoyed it thoroughly time and time again.
B00005QATY|3.0|This movie follows in the footsteps of Raising Arizona and Fargo.  Cult following comes to mind when I think of it.  Either you will love it or hate it.  There are so many one-liners that can be hung on to that it requires rewatching the movie to capture and save them.  George Clooney shows his diversity once again.  Hope you like bluegrass!
6305648522|5.0|Anyone who was a regular moviegoer as a child (probably pre 1980)and who fell under the spell of the movies then - the darkened auditorium, the flickering stream of light from the projection booth, the occasional film breakdowns - an experience totally unlike modern sanitised 'mall' moviegoing, will be enthralled by this movie.<br />Seen through the eyes of a child who helps the village moviehouse projectionist and owner, a magic world is conjured up.   Through his friendship and working relationship with the older man, and his exposure to the romanticism of the movies he helps project, the younger one learns about love, duty, loyalty and courage.<br />Italian movies of this quality used to be ten a penny.   They aren't now, which makes this movie a throwback to a great tradition and a marvellous thing to see !
0684833395|5.0|One of the most phenomenal books in the English language, it is a hilarious, perverse and unsettling trip into war.  This is not an easy read, and should be read with an open mind. With great dialogue, a fun plot, this has to be my favorite book!
6305165912|5.0|This movie is neither thought-provoking nor deep.  It's just damn funny.  To all my friends who said they did not like it, I suggested watching Lebowski again.  All changed their opinions.  The writing is perfect, the characters, while not altogether believable,  are stuffed with traits we notice in other people around us. ..forget it, I'm going bowling.
0385505833|5.0|SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is the best Christmas Fun Read since THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER! When it is made into a movie (and somebody needs to get to work on it for Chritmas 2002), I volunteer my husband for the part of Luther. I'd happily coach the actress playing Nora. Fast and funny, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is a touching and timely story to be enjoyed by the family.
B000002O4X|5.0|I have to agree with the last reviewer &quot;Mags&quot;, from<BR>Jersey Shore, &quot;Let the Rest of the World Go By&quot; is<BR>a wonderfully romantic piece which takes one back <BR>in time... Quite visual!  Another great soundtrack<BR>by John Barry that will be treasured like &quot;Somewhere<BR>in Time&quot;.  Listeners who enjoy these two favorites will<BR>appreciate &quot;John Barry Moviola&quot;, a CD which includes<BR>many of his classic themes.<br />Like Meg, I'm also interested in knowing more about the<BR>music instrumentation in &quot;Let the Rest of the World Go<BR>By&quot; as to who were the artists playing and/or artists<BR>who may have have produced a CD recapturing a similar<BR>music style reflecting this period of time.
079284632X|1.0|When I saw &quot;Last House&quot; the first time, I almost puked...<br />This film is violent, offensive, disturbing, gruesome,<br />sick, bad, and ...<br />The acting is bad, the cinematography is awful,<br />the story is a means to an end and the music is<br />terrible... the whole movie just STINKS!!!!<br />One my list of the worst films of all times!!!!<br />Just bad!
6304057709|5.0|Sense & Sensibility is a wonderful movie. It is based on the classic novel by Jane Austen.<br />It won critical acclaim and was nominated/won many awards. All of the actors do a superb job in this film.<br />I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a chance at a romantic flick and a beautiful story of love, loss, and growing up. Run out to your nearest video store and get this movie!
B00000DFTH|5.0|I know that this is a reunion cd done live so I know that every song ozzy has done with them won't make it on the album. Knowing this fact this album without a doubt diserves 5 stars! A must have for any ozzy and/sabbath fan!
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca was a book of romance and suspense that was very well written. Daphne Du Maurier wrote this very well and showed lots of detail in the book. Like when she told about Manderly she went into such fine detail about the sounds and smells and look of the estate. When she told about how Mrs. Danvers treated Mrs. De Winter I could understand how she felt. This book also showed me how life was in a house like that. It showed how the head of the house kept charge of all the help.<br />  This book was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book. It was well written, good dialogue, and enough detail to help you understand what was happening in the book. And you will never believe the ending so I suggest that anyone who reads this go read that book.
0920236162|5.0|I have loved this book for the last nine years, and given countless copies of it to all the women in my life, young and old.  Elizabeth outsmarts a dragon and rescues a prince, then discovers that he's not her prince after all.  The last image is great, and a wonderful message for all girls everywhere.
0345350499|5.0|i read this book with skepticism of it because it is  a fantasy novel but it is the best book i ever read. It also has a lot of feminist overtones which is another reason why i love this story.
0553712837|1.0|I must agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Durhan, NC - 1 star.  I found this book put me in a horrible mood and at times I just had to quit reading due to the level of negative energy between every character!  I found the whole neighborhood and the whole Christmas thing so over the top !!!  I would have told my daughter, &quot;sorry honey we have made other plans.......&quot; No tough decision there. If you want a good Grisham read - read &quot;The Partner&quot;
B00003CXTG|3.0|O.K...first of all, this is a review of the movie.  I'm not reviewing anything for it's historical accuracy, or anything like that...just it's PURE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE. Now, on to my review : )<br />I'll just say it, the love story HACKED me off...BAD.  Maybe I am one of the few left with some morals in this world, but the whole &quot;my-true-love-just-died, so-now-let-me-go-bone-his-best-friend&quot; angle did not work for me at all.  First off...IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 1941!  By the way the characters conducted themselves, you would think it was set in the here and now. I found myself not liking them.  I wasn't interested at all in that part of the movie.  The whole thing was very predictable. <br />But...the attack floored me.  I realize it may not have been 100% accurate, but I never realized how horrible things must have been at Pearl Harbor that day.  I cried the WHOLE time.  Since we in the U.S.(and actually worldwide) have seen the WTC tragedy, things that have happened in our history have taken on more meaning &amp; reality for me.  It's sad that it took something like 9/11 to open my eyes.    <br />Ok...I'm done.  In summary--the attack scenes were mind blowing, and the love story...well, it just blew.  : )
0446677450|5.0|I will admit that this book definately does repeat itself over and over, however the point is made.  I could be written better but the point is what is most important here.  It brings to light how ancient our educational system is.  I personally refuse to work for someone else, and this book gives me courage to move on with my decision.  Who really wants to make someone else money?  This book made me change my way of thinking and looking at business.  It does not give you an answer - but I think that is the point.  It made me reconsider what I have been doing financially and to make wiser decisions.  I think the best advice in this book is to &quot;pay yourself first&quot;  So simple and yet a scary thought at the same time.  <br />I would recommend this book to people that are tired of the old school thinking and are willing to change their views.  I don't think that this book will help you make money directly but it will make you think of how you can reconsider your current financial status.  <BR>In my opinion, it is a must read for those willing to broaden their horizons and think creatively.
B00005OCMR|5.0|No, it's not an accurate depiction of computers, really, but wasn't it fun to watch?<br />The special effects for its time were outstanding and I still think that they hold up well on its own today, however simplistic it may be considered by today's standards.<br />Jeff Bridge's cockiness accompanied by Bruce Boxleitner's cool, self-assured manner make them seem unstoppable against the evil Master Control Computer!!  It's an old idea of a machine with ambitions of taking over the world, but the simple premise makes the &quot;computer&quot; world exciting and fun to watch.<br />David Warner is exceptional in this film, and he deserves more credit in his acting career than he is due.  David Who you may ask?  You may recognize him as the &quot;heavy&quot; playing alongside Billy Zane in &quot;TITANIC.&quot;<br />Wonderful film, stylish effects, and a &quot;gee-whiz&quot; kind of feel to the story won't disappoint adults who saw the film originally or kids today.
B0000009UX|5.0|As most Elvisophiles know, Rhino recently purchased Mr. Costello's catalogue (including the Warner Brothers stuff) and are re-releasing each title with a bonus Disc.  While Rykodisc did a masterful job at the Columbia titles a few years ago, by the look of Rhino's first three re-releases (My Aim, Spike and Useless Beauty), they are taking EC's discs to a new and expanded level.  The thing about Imperial Bedroom is it is so completely luxurious and the songs FIT togther like they were all written in a single day session.  Listen to the first five cuts (Beyond Belief, Tears Before Bedtime, Shabby Doll, The Long Honeymoon, and Man Out Of Time) and feel the way Beatle fans feel about the medly at the end of Abbey Road.  EC was hitting his stride, frantically releasing at least an album a year until this Opus.  After Imperial Bedroom, he hit commercial success with the silly Punch The Clock and &quot;Everyday I Write The Book&quot;; and while his artistic integrity never waned, he never again hit the same peak as this gorgeous mountain of a masterpiece.  If you get a chance to buy the vinyl, do so if only to get the inner sleave with all the lyrics writtentogethersothatlikethesongonewordflowsneatlyintotheother.
B000001DYY|5.0|I have been a huge fan of tears for fears and I am a bit late with this review. Elemental is my all time favorite TFF album. It proved to us tears for fears was Roland Orzabal only. I am more than convinced curt smith was no more than a backup singer who cared about his looks(fish out of water) more than music. The elemental concert was wonderful, and curt smith was not missed at all. Rolands album Raoul and the kings of spain is a masterpiece as well. I am happy curt and roland are friends again, but I hope roland doesnt put up with him like in the past, because he doesnt need him. We found that out in Elemental.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This film, the story of paranoid schizophrenic and mathematical genius John Nash, is one of the year's best, thanks to a mind-blowing performance by Russell Crowe (I didn't think he had it in him!) and Ron Howard's vision of Nash's difficult life.  The bulk of this film covers the time between Nash's arrival on the Princeton campus to the discovery of his illness at M.I.T, but the power of the movie is fully realized during his struggle to overcome his illness and reclaim the greatness that once resided in his mind.<br />I can't say enough about Russell Crowe's performance - nothing in his &quot;Gladiator&quot; performance comes close to what he achieves here.  As for Ron Howard, he deserves kudos as well for his sensitive direction - even though the audience is likely to shed tears, Howard never goes for the sentimental.  Howard expresses this story with hard, direct camera shots that never flinch from the pain of Nash's distress.  The screenplay takes huge liberties with the real story.  For example, Princeton professors do not offer their pens as homage to a colleague, nor did Nash's illness manifest itself in the way presented (he heard voices).  No matter, though.  Film making is an art form in which visual statements are made.  Without such changes, this story would not have the same visceral power.<br />Because I live near Princeton, where this film opened in limited release, I saw A Beautiful Mind in an audience familiar with the campus, its traditions, and the story of Nash.  Despite the obvious liberties director Ron Howard took with some of the scenes, I could tell that the rest of the audience,like me, didn't care because Howard captured the spirit of the story.<br />See this film for both the story and the acting.  You won't regret it.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Ok, so the singing isn't Broadway, but the directing, cinematography and yes, even the acting, are top rate.  If you don't like musicals, you will probably find this movie campy.  Is it worth adding to your DVD library...yes!
0061040967|5.0|I, like the multitude of reveiwers before me, was absolutely floored by Kidby's illustrations.  I particularly liked his portrayl of Rincewind and Vetinari, Ankh-Morpork, Death (of course!), and the fabulous space views of the Disc.  However, the most enjoyable part of this book for me was actually the writing :-p !  Pratchett uses some of his best one liners in recent memory here!  The plot harks back to the early days of the Disc, but this only serves to highlight the author's development.  It seems that the Discworld is finally on the road to recovery after &quot;The Truth&quot;, in my opinion the only genuinely bad novel yet.  Vetinari in particular seems back to his old self.<br /> What more can I say?  This is classic Prachett writing, matched with unparalleled arkwork, and though it is definitely on the expensive side, I thought it was well worth it.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.<BR>Need I say more.
B000056HOZ|5.0|The very first DVD I purchased and let me tell you it was an absolute hit at Christmas time.  You get all the great videos like &quot;Glory Days&quot;; &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, plus a few concert scenes showing Bruce when he was just starting out.  It really is great.  I suggest that anyone who has a DVD and plans on throwing a party, pick up this DVD.  You will not be dissapointed.  The only thing that could have been better would have been if there were interviews with Bruce himself or The E Street band.  That would have been cool.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Oh, who cares if the director overdid it, or if the stars can or can't sing very well (I think they did just fine, and I'm a professional musician)!  The bottom line is, this is one of the most original films I've seen in years, and  it's a total feast for the senses!  Turn up the surround sound, put it on the biggest screen you can find, and have a great time watching this musical!  I think the constant homages to other musicians and their songs is fun and nostalgic too.  And the one original love ballad really soars!  The DVD has so many additinal features, and even the packaging is the best I've seen yet in a DVD.  Great all around.  Just don't be so serious about it...have some aloha and enjoy it for the fun of it!
B00005JKQX|5.0|Crowe and cast sweep the viewer into the story of a man who struggles to acknowledge, understand, and finally - to honor his limitations.  <br />While driving home, reflecting on the film,  I realized what Crowe and Howard had done. They had taken me into a world where fears are faced, sometimes with great pain. And fears are overcome, sometimes with the assistance of great love and perseverance, as in the case of John Nash and family.<br />Cheers to Ron Howard and Crowe and the rest of the cast for bringing us such an uplifting story - one that champions the human spirit and reminds us all that as long as we can laugh at ourselves, we will always prevail.  How fitting when the film ended, the  audience applauded.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I'm giving this movie four stars because it was done with <BR>brilliant direction from Baz Luhrman and Ewan Macgregor was<BR>so adorable and perfect with his role .Throughout this movie <BR>he looked so in love and had the sweetest most sincere expression I have <BR>ever seen on his face ,and his voice is so beautiful. But Nicole Kidman who I liked in the others has a bland voice that shows no<BR>emotion in it and didn't seem to show a lot of emotion with her acting in return.<BR>So if they had just cast someone else in her part it would be a 5.Please make more movies Baz.
B00005CDNK|5.0|These is for me one of the best ABBAalbums, I got it some days ago,the sound is similar to the 1997 remaster edition, but a diferent art which is brillant and colorful.........
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I thought it was very artisitic.  I think they usedd all the craziness in the beginning for art.  The Moulin Rouge songs and dances were like a curtain being openned on to this love seen.  I thought the scene were Satine and the crew of the play run around dancing and singing &quot; Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;, was a bit dumb but I think the purpose of that scene was to make it appear as though Satine was okay.  The music was dramatic and crazy.  The actresses and actors had excellent voices and sung quite well.  <br />I already own the soundtrack and now I plan to own Moulin Rouge on VHS, when it comes out.  <br />This movie is very dramatic and I actually cried the first three times I saw it.  It was a lot like Romeo and Juliet except sadder.  Those who have seen the movie understand what I mean.<br />*****
068484267X|5.0|This is a magnificent first-hand account of being Irish, Catholic and poor! With his wit and charm, McCourt brings life to a very gloom atmosphere of Limerick, where boys are forced to &quot;interfere&quot; with themselves when there's no oppotunity for a real &quot;excitement&quot;, but --thanks to confessions and St Francis of Asissi!-- they can be absolved in order not to go straight to hell; where fish and chips can also be &quot;licked&quot; up off newspapers; where a goat's head can make Christmas --indeed!-- a merry occasion. <BR>Growing up in a Catholic environment myself, I can empathize with McCourt: making up &quot;sins&quot; for Saturday confessions, burdened by guilt after &quot;interfering&quot; with myself, tormented by fear of dropping the Lord's &quot;body&quot; to the floor while receiving Communion. But unlike McCourt, I was lucky to be accepted as an altar boy -- a oportunity to taste the Lord's &quot;blood&quot; in sachristy! <BR>&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; gives an insight of how (not?) to be a Catholic, and a poor one at that!
B000002GJH|5.0|An amazing album.  Some of Chris Cornell's best writing because it wasn't for Soundgarden, and anyone who has his solo album knows what i mean. It's more of the Beatles/Blues side of soundgarden, rather than the Zeppelin/Sabbath thing they did, which is amazing too.  I wish there was more of eddie on this though, all those harmonies would've been really interesting with that low voice.  Mike McCready is just amazing, plain and simple.  Matt Cameron is my favorite drummer and he does some outstanding stuff, but there are a lot of missed fills that he probably wishes he could do over.  We forgive you Matt, because Badmotorfinger is the most difficult thing I've tried to play.  It is funny hearing Chris Cornell singing Stone's songs, like Times of Trouble....hm...should've been on Ten.  Jeff is Jeff, plays like he always does haha.  All in all, a great cd that kind of got lost in the Seattle shuffle.  Go out and buy this.  These guys should definately try to play again.  hell, now that matt cameron is in pearl jam, chris just has to show up!!
B00005V1Z0|5.0|Exciting and action packed.  I found the movie to have a good plot and moved at a quick pace.  Was sorry when it was over.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes the Indian Jones movies etc.  Very good ... 5 stars!!!!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|WOW I think what surprises me more than anything is the number of GOOD reviews this thing got!  This has got to be the worst piece of &quot;entertainment&quot; I have ever seen!  I never got over the opening credits, when a subtitle tells us the setting is Paris in the 1800s or something.. and then they proceed to sing all these 1999-2001 songs... and i was left thinking.. what the H@LL is going on here!  Are we in a timewarp or what!  My friend kept telling me.. it will get better, just wait.  But after 30 minutes they were doing the same nonsense--singing noisily and I can't see even a vague resemblence of a plot.  Needless to say I watched not another second of this garbage.  As soon as I saw &quot;from the maker of Romeo and Juliet&quot; I should have turned it off.. That was also unbearable.  What I can't get is that some people actually like this guy's style?!?!  All I can say is WATCH IT before you BUY IT!!!  Don't make my mistake.
B0000039PW|5.0|The greatest rap cd of all time. Any rap fan will love this mix of old school rhymes, exceptional lyrical content, great beats, and hooks.  I rate this album a 5+
0345363132|5.0|Richard III is one of history's most controversial figures.  No one, it seems, can form a consensus with regards to an interpretation of the facts regarding him, or for that matter, agree on what the facts really *are*.  Read 3 different (non fiction) books on Richard III, and you're likely to hear 3 different versions of events.  <br />Personally, I believe that Richard III *did* kill his nephews, though I admit that there are plenty of facts that contradict this theory as well. <br />The reason I'm telling you all this is because some readers state that you have to be a Ricardian to enjoy this novel.  You do not.  No one alive today knows for sure what sort of person Richard III really was.  I enjoyed &quot;The Sunne in Splendor&quot; immensely, but I like Shakespeare's &quot;Richard III&quot; as well.  Instead of arguing over which is the more historically accurate version of events, I feel that readers should appreciate the two works for what they are:  stunningly well written stories that have vivid characters and intriguing plots that may or may not reflect what really happened during one of history's most tempestuos eras.  Even if historians learn for certain in the future that Richard III did murder his nephews, I would still recommend this novel.  It's just that good.
0345350499|4.0|Written from the point of view of several, influential women at Arthur's legendary court, Marion Zimmer Bradley weaves a tragic tapestry of intrigue, doubt, and nostalgia. As the characters step into a new world, each one deals with the insecurities created by the shifting paradigm in varying ways. The tale is not just a sweeping, alternative retelling of the Arthurian legend but a more personal story of trying to cope with change: first by acknowledging its inevitability (and the perils of resistance) and then by improvising unique ways to adapt one's life to transition. The author includes enough historical and literary linkages (e.g. references to Beowulf and Oedipus, St. Patrick and St. Brighid, the withdrawal of Rome from Britain with only a few Roman-British warriors to help natives counter the barbarian invasion).<br />The length of the book proved to be a barrier in that some of the plots and information garnered in the beginning of the story receded into the mists of memory by the second half. I found it difficult to keep up with all the support cast. The personalities of the characters were also subject to sudden changes that in a few instances seemed arbitrary, but perhaps the mystery surrounding the identities of the characters inhabiting Bradley's Britain is part of the mists that become a grand motif. Transience of all things and the dynamic flux that controls every aspect of the land and its people are the dominant themes, far outweighing the clash of religions and cultures that visually overshadows the underlying story. One would think, though, that not all Christians were so simple-minded and petty and that many more people would tread the path of Taliesen or Kevin than their more zealous peers. Despite these drawbacks, few and far in between, the epic deserves an equal place next to T.H. White's Arthurian tale.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is a soundtrack that grips the listener and takes them for an emotional ride from the beginning to the end. This wonderful concoction that was concieved by the originators, sufficiently supports and becomes a vital part towards the movie's overall success. I highly recommend this soundtrack, cheers.

B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down are unfairly categorized with the nu-metal genre of music that seems to be popular these days. The reason it is so unfair, is because people fail to realize that these guys have innovated a sound that is theirs alone. You can immediately recognize any of their gems that happen to be on the radio as SOAD. There is never any question. I mean who else could have pulled off &quot;Sugar&quot; and kept it credible. The insanity and depth of the song would have falen apart on an average band, but with these guys the issues and humor are kept completely intact. Their sound is a wonderful cross between Frank Zappa and Slayer with all of the humor, musicianship, and politics that comes with it. All of the songs are hard-hitting, face smashing jams with outstanding vocals and musicianship. These guys are bound to become huge and largely influential in the years to come. I hear Toxicity is even better! I can't wait to get it. They have all of my respect and admiration.
B000002NHN|5.0|I just got this CD for Christmas, along with &quot;The Mask and the Mirror&quot;, and am listening to it daily. Ms. McKennitt's voice is angelic, her arrangements are hypnotic and even the little booklets packed with the CDs are fascinating.  &quot;Marco Polo&quot; completely takes me to the medieval far east; I can practically smell the exotic spices and see the caravan progressing through the strange and beautiful land.  &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is absolutely gorgeous and ethereal.  Each piece is exquisite in its own way, evoking images and sensations that take you to another plane of existence.  I would say this is the stronger of the two CDs, but &quot;The Mystic's Dream&quot; and &quot;The Bonny Swans&quot; are just as enchanting as anything on this CD.  A good deal to get both!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Yes, when I firstly was going to see Moulin Rouge I was quite sceptical - ok, I'll watch it, but only because I watch every movie this theatre shows. The first 15 minutes I was stunned - so much of colors, noise, moving... People, help!!!!! Where AM I???? were my thoughts... But...Well, it went further and further, and I was more and more stunned, this time with excitement. Ewan McGregor has a really unusual voice, very beautiful. Nicole not so strong, but also very cute. Just fits the moments. I can tell that I cried with delightment. This is the best movie I've ever saw. The plot is pretty simple of course, but I think the simplest is the most beautiful. But the only thing. Firstly you have to see it in ONLY the cinema. Because my mum saw it only on video, and she didn't like it as much as me. You can't get that feeling of everything surrounds you;-)
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Word of mouth told me to get this cd. I just couldn't quite pull the trigger until I saw this, of all places, in the used cut-out bins. It was a great buy for what turns out to be one of the best albums of 2001. I haven't heard Dylan sounding this good, with this strong of material in....well, I just haven't heard Dylan sounding this good. He sings like he's got a renewed vigor, but even better he's got an extra hot band of backing musicians with Larry Campbell, Charlie Sexton on guitar, and the legendary Augie Meyers from Sir Douglas on organ and accordian. Thanks to Sexton, Dylan really rocks out here on &quot;Honest With Me&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot;, and the opener &quot;Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dum&quot;. But it's his slower Dylan-like songs that really grabbed me. Especially &quot;Bye and Bye&quot; with Augie Meyers supplying the B-3 on this nice mid-tempo downhome feeling song. &quot;Floater&quot; is a tune that keeps spinning around in my head. It's very catchy, and sounds like something that comes straight out of the south in the 1920's. A great little swingin' number with a violin lick by Campbell that I swear I've heard before...somewhere. Another good one is &quot;Moonlight&quot;. A song that, again, sounds more retro than modern day folk. Dylan's singing isn't as gruffy here, and actually sounds pretty nice on this song. He even does some straight on blues  with &quot;High Water&quot; and &quot;Cry a Little&quot;. I loved the diversity that Dylan gives us on this album. It's a little bit folk/country, and lot of rock and blues with that retro thang goin' on. All I know is, it was a great surprise, and a road I hope Dylan keeps travelling down. As far as I'm concerned, he's never sounded better. From beginning to end, a great listen!
6304508611|4.0|This Brian dePalma smash hit has become a horror classic.  And rightly so!  The story is about a teenager called Carrie who gains telekinetic powers through her harrowing adolescence.  The reason that this movie was so far ahead was the fact that it made the viewer question whether the victims were completely innocent.  Various acts of cruel torture inflicted upon Carrie by her peers are visually arresting, with one being known as the second most famous shower scene in all of film (the first being Marion Crane's death in `Psycho').  Adolescence is shown for the horror that it really is, making us think whether all those popular girls from other horror flicks were as sweet and nice as they really looked.  This certainly sets it apart from many other such movies.<br />The acting is also fantastic, with Sissy Spacek as Carrie and Piper Laurie as her obsessive mother being especially impressive.  We also get to see a young John Travolta in one of his early movie roles, as the boyfriend of the most popular girl in school.  Each character is fleshed out, and it's a credit to the director that the audience feels such a mixture of feelings for every character.  For instance, the kindly P.E. teacher is overheard sneering at Carrie's trauma, a mean girl ends up crying and a popular girl tries to do her best to get Carrie a date for the prom.  Meanwhile, Carrie herself is a mixture of burnt up rage from years of oppression and a secret desire to be a part of the crown that she abhors so much.<br />Plus, if you like your scares, then there are plenty here.  Carrie's mother is absolutely terrifying in her absolute certainty that she is doing the right thing by her daughter.  The end scene especially will make you jump out of your seats and you're constantly left wondering what will happen next.  All that and there's a great score.  It is simply magnificent and a milestone in the horror genre.

B00000DFKF|5.0|Filosofem had some stupid effect on the Count's voice. Det Som couldn't properly follow it up. This is the definitive Burzum. Lonely, yearning atmospheres, hypnotizing rhythms, Varg's best vocal performance. He never matched this.
B00005R2IS|5.0|This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released. <br />Both widescreen and full screen versions are included, but more importantly, the original Australian dialogue has finally been restored. The difference between that and the clunky, awkward American-dubbed audio most of us are familiar with is like night and day (and if you want to find out for yourself, both are included on the disc, so feel free to compare). <br />Rounding out the package is a making-of featurette, several trailers, and a &quot;pop-up video&quot; style subtitles-option which presents various minutea about the film and its locations while you watch.
B000005HLV|5.0|Interestingly, the hype that lead up to this album is only a small part of it's allure. This is an astonishing accomplishment. People often reccomend heavy metal albums on the basis of how &quot;evil&quot; they sound. This is the real deal.
B000001EIA|5.0|This was the appearence that heralded the Reuion tour.  For me, and many other fans; it was a long awaited moment.  I think alot of people were surprised at how well the songs translated to acoustic versions.  The pinacle moment was the introduction of &quot;some members of the family...&quot; I got chills.  I also felt that the version of Rock&amp;RollALLNite with EVERY member of the group past and present was awsome!  I wish we could hear more of stuff like that!  This is one of my most frequently played albums!  It was incredible!
B00004WEJZ|2.0|Given that this film tends to be overlooked by all and sundry, it's easy to bend too far backwards in finding things to praise - thus, the reviews here tend to be either 'this film was dire' or 'this is a flawed gem'. The reality is somewhere in between, and closer to the former opinion, sadly.<BR>The biggest problem is that, despite the presence of Sean Connery and, at least nominally, M, Q, Blofeld and so forth, it doesn't really seem like a 'Bond Film'. There isn't a great deal of action, the film doesn't appear to have had much money spent on it (presumably most of the budget went towards Connery's salary), and as for Connery himself - he seems to have lost the 'edge' that he brought to his first stint as Bond. This version of the character seems too nice and cuddly, and it doesn't help that he gets to wear some terrible clothes (and what appears to be a toupee).<BR>Particular mention must be made of the incidental music, which, curiously, is mostly light jazz / be-bop, even during the action sequences. It's terribly jarring and doesn't work at all, almost as if the producers were trying to evoke a 60's atmosphere, but in a really bad way.<BR>More than this, the core problem - the one that kills 'Never Say Never Again' stone dead - is that this film was done with greater style and flair in 1965, as 'Thunderball'. There's no reason not to buy that, instead.<BR>As for the DVD itself, you get the film and a box and the trailer.
B00005N5VO|2.0|This movie is almost as old as I am, and it shows.  I just don't have an hour to invest in getting interested in a movie.  I just about gave up at the hour mark, but pushed through it.  This is just a snoozer of a film.<br />The ending is just ridiculous, there's no tension, Roy's character barely speaks.  If not for Hackman this movie wouldn't even be watchable.
6305657947|5.0|Summary:<BR>Remake of 1968 film with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway (appears as Crowne's Psychiatrist - conscience).  Great story, script, acting, locations, scenery, music, theme, editing, etc.  Everything is interesting, moving, paced and fits together.  And, the directing must have been great behind the camera because each actor performed at their best.   The DVD has a great Director's Commmetary (John McTiernan) - one of the better commentaries I've heard.<br />Story:<BR>Pierce Brosnan comes unto his own as an actor as Thomas Crowne, a bored billionaire who concocts the impossible art theft to bring excitement into his life.  But, he got a bigger challenge than he planned for when Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) shows up as an art bounty hunter who uses her womanly wiles to catch Crowne.  Dennis Leary plays a regular guy type detective<br />He pulls her along for high stakes fun and games!  The final twists were better than the first. <br />The music is outstanding and the \\"Thomas Crowne Affair\\" CD is a great buy (except its missing a few songs).  On the side, the art theme also generates a new appreciation for fine art.<br />Negative:<BR>Can't think of anything negative, except I wanted more!<br />...
B00004T1C8|5.0|My 2 year old was given a Brio train set and table<BR>from Santa this year and this mountain is the highlight<BR>of the setup.  It is heavy and durable as someone mentioned,<BR>but it also creates an auditory environment for the kids<BR>while they play.  The mountain makes noises when trains<BR>pass through it (owl hooting, clanking from men working, a choo <BR>choo whistle noise) and the purpose of our train table has been to see the trains go through the mountain and up the hill on the other side (add a hill too, you'll be glad you did).<br />This accessory was money well spent for....Santa. If your kids<BR>like train noises, you might also want to consider the battery<BR>run Brio red engine = it has headlights and also makes a real<BR>&quot;choo choo&quot; noise when pushed.  My 2 year old has that one as well and he often insists we take it everywhere.
0345440757|3.0|I have a preemie with a digestive system that's very sensitive. If I had followed her breastfeeding advice to the letter, my daughter would *not* have gained properly-- and formula was not an option in her case, due both to her immune and digestive systems. In the early weeks of breastfeeding, IGNORE HER ADVICE! Once your milk supply is well established... that's another story. But be sure to talk to your doctor, too. Her analysis of cries is very good-- it helped me distinguish between 'gassy' and 'pooping,' but at times her tone can be condescending and annoying to those of us who choose different approaches (after telling readers we can discard the advice that doesn't work for us, she then seems to have little patience for parents who do just that). Not a bad book, but make sure it's not the only one on hand!
B00000INEX|1.0|I just can't believe they put out the same video as Baby Mozart but with a bit of variation and music change. That's marketing.<BR>These videos are great for putting infants to sleep, but not much else.<BR>I recommend the Baby Know It All series.  They use children illustrating activities, a whole range of music, and our baby actually learns while having fun. Great precurser to sesame street. They are hard to find, though.<BR>Seems like the good things always are.
B000002PBL|5.0|On this album, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers really come into their own, thus coming up with a variety of unique musical styles and arrangements. This is evidenced in a majority of the selections featured on &quot;Hard Promises&quot;. The album starts off with a rockin' flurry, courtesy of the first three numbers (&quot;The Waiting&quot;, &quot;A Woman In Love (It's Not Me)&quot; and &quot;Nightwatchman&quot;), then mellows out with a soothing cool down, as noted in the tracks &quot;Something Big&quot;, &quot;Letting You Go&quot; and &quot;Insider&quot;. The CD almost ends just as it began, with the driven-homeness of &quot;The Criminal Kind&quot; and &quot;You Can Still Change Your Mind&quot;. Even though Petty and the 'Breakers left a little of their Byrds and Dylan influences behind on &quot;Hard Promises&quot;, this is still an outstanding effort, for the most part. Petty &amp; crew really proved to the world they could stand on their own ten legs (even with a little help from Stevie Nicks, who provides backing vocals on &quot;Insider&quot; and &quot;A Thing About You&quot;. Petty later returned the favor on Nicks' &quot;Bella Donna&quot; album, released later the same year &quot;Hard Promises&quot; came out [1981]), and it shows in the band's musicianship, as featured on this CD. Bob Dylan would be impressed with Tom Petty's awesome sound-alike vocalization on &quot;The Criminal Kind&quot;. One of your first New Year's resolutions should be including this priceless musical gem in your CD collection. This should be one &quot;Promise&quot; that isn't &quot;Hard&quot; to keep, and thus, is one &quot;Easy&quot; sell!
0783228317|5.0|Who needs a defined plot when the movie is interesting enough without one! A weird, drug-crazed trip through Las Vegas... you just have to see it to really understand. There is no plot, no sub plot, just an odd experience put into film.
B00005QGAX|4.0|Bad is, I think, another Michael Jackson masterpiece.  Critics may deem it as a failure, but I certainly don't.  My favorite tracks are (ps they are also the best tracks on the album, I gurrantee!)<br />Bad<BR>The Way You Make Me Feel<BR>Speed Demon<BR>The Man In The Mirror<BR>Smooth Criminal<BR>Streetwalker...only if you have the special edition!
B00005U2LM|5.0|HOT album! Definately worthy of carrying the torch of previous Wu-Tang albums. Best songs - Soul Power, Uzi, Rules, Babies &amp; Back in the Game.
B00005JKES|5.0|Being a fan of the show when it first popped onto the screen in the eighties I was overjoyed to see a First Season box set release of this innovative and evocative creation of David Lynch and Mark Frost. Although the lack of the pilot episode (due to apparent studio battles) will aggravate a lot of fans, the enclosed booklet outlining the story so far and the 'Previously on Twin Peaks' section on episode 1 should fill in the gaps. The DVD transfer is excellent, picture quality is superb making the whole season have a beauty about it that was perhaps missing on TV broadcast. The sound has also been given a five star treatment offering the choice of either stereo, 5.1 or DTS and this should satisfy all DVD buyers. Top class all round. Buy it.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Since we purchased this in early December, my kids have seen it at least 100 times.  I've had to sit through it considerably less, but I must admit that despite the repitition, this is still one good video.
0140544518|5.0|The students in my third grade class love this story.  They were very interested in finding out what the wolf's side of the story was!  It is a funny way to look at the same event from two different points of view.  I introduced this book as part of a newspaper mini-lesson.  We talked about always finding out both sides of the stoy they are working on.  My students now take this lesson to heart as they write their own newspaper articles.
B00005JKHP|2.0|Having seen the original series of episodes many, many times over the years, and still love it. Including ALL of the motion pictures, I find this movie to be extremely boring. The special effects were very good, and all, but the movie was very slow, and the script was to me, not a Kirk's &quot;Star Trek&quot; script! I would not recommend this movie. I purchased this on VCR when it first came out after watching it, I was let down by what I saw.
B00003CXSP|4.0|After watching SILENCE OF THE LAMBS several years ago, I was &quot;en-grossed&quot; with the brilliance of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.  Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lecter did not dine much in the first movie as he was more preoccupied with Agent Clarice Starling of the FBI and helping her nab Buffalo Bill, Lecter's former patient and infamous serial killer.  SILENCE had enough gore and graphic content, but HANNIBAL makes the former look sheepish.  If you like blood and mutilation, you will enjoy this movie, because it is not for the faint of heart.  On a more positive note, HANNIBAL is a movie with much intrigue and suspense.  You will have to watch and listen closely in between meals or you just might miss something.<br />The real story is set in motion with one of Dr. Lecter's surviving victims, Mason Verger, devising a plan to get his revenge from a previous encounter that forever disfigured his face.  Verger, a multimillionaire, places a bounty of $3m on information leading to Lecter's whereabouts so he can carry out his diabolical plan.  Verger hates the doctor so much that he wants to send him to the pig farm.<br />Meanwhile the celebrated Agent Starling, who cracked the Buffalo Bill case, has innocently been accused for botching a more recent FBI operation with her envious supervisor, Deputy Assistant Inspector Paul Krendler, apparently desiring to remove her from the force.  An internal FBI investigation leads Starling a reassignment to the Lecter case, which she finds fascinatingly refreshing.  Of course, Lecter has become one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted criminals in the world and has ingeniously escaped their clutches for years; therefore, Krendler thinks it will preoccupy Starling's time.<br />This is the point where all the characters and subplots begin to converge, and all eyes focus on HANNIBAL.  Does he like the attention?  I think so, but woe to any that are rude or seek to advance their own cause by using the good doctor.  He states this fact simply, &quot;I don't like rude people.&quot;  Moreover, Lecter (alias Dr. Fell) becomes enraptured that Clarice has entered the investigative fray, for he admires her very much.  Could this be love?  You will have to discover this for yourself in the myriad of gore and bloodletting.  Another observation, &quot;Who is the good guy and the bad guy in this one?  Or should I say, who is the rotten apple in a basket of bad apples?&quot;  It becomes cloudy as the story progresses.<br />Ridley Scott has directed another fine film, of course not the caliber of GLADIATOR, which won him Oscar.  As far as the cast, one cannot say enough about Anthony Hopkins (Oscar winner) who performs wonderfully as the brilliant and deranged doctor.  The character seems to be a perfect fit for him, and one could not imagine another replacing him.  Hopkins is arguably the greatest actor of our time, and performs masterfully in everything he undertakes; therefore, one can simply call him, &quot;Sir&quot;.<br />Julianne Moore put in a top-rate performance as Agent Starling; however, who can replace a superior actress like Jodie Foster?  It seemed Moore lacked some of the intensity and feeling that Foster portrayed as the Special FBI Agent.  In supporting roles, Gary Oldman matches step with Hopkins as Mason Verger, especially having to play the part with a mangled face.  Ray Liotta (FBI Deputy Assistant Inspector Paul Krendler) put in good performance, but I was especially impressed with Giancarlo Giannini as Inspector Renaldo Pazzi.  He played the part of the disheveled detective looking for a break out of his profession by making it big on bounty money.<br />In conclusion, a word of advice when viewing HANNIBAL: Be careful of what you eat before, during, and after the film.  This one is not for children under 17.own cause by using the good doctor.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This was quite a let down when it comes to movies.  The cinematography was wonderful, however it was severely hindered by a poor script that was monotonous, predictable, and overdone.  It was like they made a story so they could have an excuse to charge people for 20-30 minutes of special effects.  Oh well, what else is new in Hollywood?
1558908420|4.0|This is the sort of movie Sylvester Stallone SHOULD have been making in the post- &quot;Rocky&quot; years, before his career got sidetracked into Rambo silliness- simply put: well written, wonderfully acted, and beautifully filmed.  Yes, Stallone can act. (Of course, sharing a bill with DeNiro, Keitel, and Liotta would make ANYONE look good.)<br />For enhanced viewing pleasure, watch this movie as an homage to &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot;  Seriously.  The parallels are quite clever.<br />Enjoy!
0385505833|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was easy to follow and made me laugh and cry, which I don't usually do when I read books.  You will enjoy it too!
B00000J2PH|5.0|I normally don't join the ranks of the amateur music reviewers [...here] - probably because I'm a music major who constantly questions her own legitimacy. Yet I felt compelled to sing the praises of this album, which was given to me at Christmas. I've always enjoyed Carole King's songs, and had recently expressed the wish to buy this classic album. Luckily, my dad got the hint and bought it for me. <BR> Although not generally a fan of artists of the 70's, let alone any popular artists, I find that Carole King's songs are timeless and certainly resonate with any woman, and men as well. Her lyrics, simplistic yet profoundly touching, are swept along by memorable melodies. <BR> These songs are classics, and most of them are recognizable even to the most unfamiliar ear - Tracks 1,2,3,6,7,9 and 12 especially. My favorites: the uplifting \\"Beautiful,\\" the emotional out-pouring and trepidation of \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\\" the witty \\"Smackwater Jack,\\" the charmingly mystical allegory in \\"Tapestry,\\" and, of course, the song every female has either sung or wished to, \\"Natural Woman.\\" <BR> It's a good thing that Dad gave me the CD and not the cassette, because I would surely have worn out the tape by now.
B00005JKES|1.0|My low rating is not for the series itself, but for the way it is packaged and offered.  If you have never seen Twin Peaks, be forewarned that the &quot;Season 1&quot; DVD set does NOT include the Pilot which included the murder and the beginnings of the investigation which was the basis of the entire series.  I don't believe the Pilot episode is even out on DVD yet.  One has to wonder at the thought process of releasing a collection of discs that chronicle the investigation of a murder without releasing the episode in which the murder occurred.  Instead, Episode 1 of this set jumps into a &quot;Previously on Twin Peaks...&quot; segment that loosely summarizes the pilot and puts the viewer into a position of trying to figure out who is who and why side comments between characters should be important, or what they even mean.  Whether or not this series is better than the X-Files may be debatable, but there is no question as to which DVD set is superior.  X-Files offers 24 episodes per set, with 6 episodes per disc.  That would pretty much be the entire Twin Peaks repertoire, which is available here with less than 2 episodes per disc on average.  X-Files also includes TV spots, commentary, documentaries and even games.  I'm not trying to promote X-Files over Twin Peaks, but instead point the Twin Peaks marketing team to an example of a &quot;good job&quot; in the hopes that they can do a better job with the remainder of their product.
B00005JKT8|3.0|I quite enjoyed this, but thought that more careful writing could have made it as good as it deserved to be.<br />Much of the situation's interest comes from how a titled gentleman from 1876 would react to New York in the 21st Century.<br />Much of that is charmingly done--and Jackman himself does a marvelous job.<br />But a gentleman of that time would have been shocked to the garters by Kate's morality. He never would have carried her to her bedroom if he thought of her of anything but a trollop, and she asks him to stay the night?<br />Further his demonstrated &quot;gallentry&quot; in lighting a cigarette for a woman (with a wooden matach) is something he wouldn't have done even for a prostitute.<br />The recreation of 1876 is wonderful. Meg Ryan is wonderful. Everythingh is wonderful except the research.<br />Also, did I miss something. One review said Jackman was Kate's bofriend's grandfather--and there is some incest issue. Maybe I was asleep during that part but I saw no reference to is in the film.
B000003S0I|5.0|This album is just incredible. The first time I heard it I felt like I'd been hit in the head with a baseball bat. There are so many twists and turns throughout the album, and even within single songs, that sometimes I don't even remember where I am because I get so engrossed in the music. When you have a drum-god like Bill Bruford you know you're in for some insane, polyrhythmic, multi-metered drumming. But combine that with the controlled guitar insanity of Robert Fripp, the solid booming bass lines of John Wetton, the gorgeous violin playing of David Cross, and the...weird percussion of Jamie Muir (who apparently quit King Crimson, and music altogether, to join a monestary after recording this album) and you have one rollercoaster of an album. So, if you like interesting, sometimes challenging, and often beautiful music you should definitely check out this album.<br />Suggested tracks:<BR>Larks' Tongues in Aspic part 1 - most people don't make it past the violin solo...I like the violin solo (shrug.)<br />Exiles - Fripp's solo on this song is perfect<br />Easy Money - Weird sound effects and percussion<br />Larks' Tongues in Aspic part 2 - I tried to learn this song once...I can play about the first ten seconds of it.
B00003CXXS|2.0|I'm supposing the DVD is loaded with extras to keep you away from watching the movie itself?<br />The burning question is:  How are they going to manage a plot that gets them back to that island...again?  Well, they pulled one out of thin air and off we go.  The scenery is still beautiful but the aura has faded from this once great idea.  Horrid writing is the worst enemy of any movie.  There were stories that this one was written as they filmed.  It sure seemed that way.<br />Jurassic Park, sadly, is taking the route of the Jaws series.  Steadily getting worse.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Ok, i don't normally buy soundtracks, i think they're usually cheesy, but this is awesome! it really does justice to the book AND to the movie<BR>if you like lotr, buy this
6301942647|5.0|8 visionary interpretations of life through the dreams of a master filmmaker. All are visually stunning with a philosophical message tied to it. Not one episode is a waste of time, but rather an enrichment of the mind, with a pure visual focus of beauty. This ranks as one of the master's greatest films, and one of the most unique, beautiful films ever committed to celluloid. &quot;Dreams&quot; is a collage of powerful messages and images weaved together into a voloptuous storybook of a film.

B00005OM4N|2.0|\\"I wanted to make [Britney] nastier and funkier,\\" the pop princess commented to MTV when asked about Britney, her third album released this past November 2001. Well, don't get too excited. If you're listening for a fresh beat from Britney Spears, don't expect to find it in her new album.<br /> Britney is simply this: a collaboration of typical, but fun pop songs. After issuing her first single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", from her third CD, Britney's music seemed to offer a bit more than her usual syrup. She reveals some attitude- throwing in a few swears; even the synthesized music is much more disco-like, and to some extent unlike the usual Britney. Perhaps that is why \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" was the first song released.<br /> Furthermore, Britney's idea of \\"nastier and funkier\\" is quite disappointing. She sprinkles her trademark mild language with sexual innuendo and occasional musical grooves reminiscent of the seventies and eighties eras; her sassy voice remains largely the same as it had in her first two chart-topping albums, Baby One More Time and Oops...I Did It Again, with no noticeable developments, such as vocal sophistication and tonality.<br />  Albeit this CD does not meet her propaganda, Britney Spears finally makes an effort to introduce some original thoughts into her music. In this album, she takes a hand in the lyrics by co-writing five out of the eleven songs, one of them with music artists, Dido, titled \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\". Throughout her third CD, Britney Spears attempts to tell her listeners that she is no longer a child. This becomes quite obvious in her track, \\"Boys\\", where she says the phrase \\"get nasty\\" at least a dozen times.  Despite her efforts to develop unique subject matter, these songs have a tired de ja vu quality. This princess' act is getting exhausted and old.<br /> Britney's attempt to explore various genres of music is poor. \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\" is Britney's most inferior track; Britney takes a classic rock song, throws in some whines and whoops, trying to remake it into something that it's clearly not- a pop song. <br /> Overall, Britney is just another pop album; the songs are lively and bold, but lacking depth. If you enjoyed Britney Spears' first two multi-platinum albums, Britney is recommended, however don't expect anything unique. The songs in Britney have the same repetitive bubblegum sound that has been drummed into every teenager's head since \\"Baby One More Time\\". You could even say Britney \\"drives me crazy\\".
B00003CWTI|4.0|As a movie, I found Magnolia to be entrancing. Watch it at least for the ensemble cast (including Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Jason Robards, William H. Macy, etc. etc. etc.). Everyone did great, and the premise of colliding &quot;coincidences&quot; makes the movie unusual and entertaining.<br />The bonus disk starts off well enough. An Aimee Mann video and a few short clips of Frank Mackey's sexist infomercials are great. I actually could have watched a half-hour of his product peddling (though the clip runs at just over three minutes... pity.). The only other thing you really get on the bonus disk is a dreadfully boring &quot;video diary&quot; from P.T. Anderson, who comes off as incredibally annoying and self-important. The diary clocks in at about 90 minutes but you'll be fast forwarding through it after about 10 minutes. It's hardly a bonus at all.<br />Still, a bonus disk should be just that -- a bonus -- so I guess I shouldn't complain. If you enjoyed the movie, the video/audio quality is excellent, so I would recommend picking up this DVD. Just don't expect too much from the bonus disk.
6303286542|4.0|The videos on this tape are: Deuces are Wild, Livin on the Edge, Eat the Rich, Amazing, Cryin, Crazy, Rag Doll, Angel, What it Takes, Love in an Elevator, Janies got a Gun, The Other Side, and Dude looks like a Lady. <BR>There is also a few minutes intro to each video showing the making of the video, or some promotional spots they have done in other countries, or an ad for Rock the Vote, and some short interview footage.<BR>It is high quality, and is about 90 minutes long. I cannot wait for their next VHS to be released... would love to have Pink, Jaded, and all their other 'new' stuff on tape as well. Highly recommended.
B00005LANG|1.0|I tried heroically to listen to reggae music, so I went for the best: Bob Marley, and bought this CD. With all due respect to the late Marley, this kind of music is totally boring and repetitive. I didnt enjoy it at all, I passed my CD ahead to a friend of mine. Really weak tunes. To say this is &quot;rock&quot; is a heresy.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|I bought this and sold it back the same day. There are enough people preaching to all of us on a daily basis from many different sources, it's not why I buy music. Really disappointed because I believe one could argue that Prince is perhaps THE most talented artist around. In fact, I can appreciated his talent musically on this release, however it is overshadowed by the lyrical content. And, this offering has no flow. It's like a bad Dead show when Jerry and Bobby used to fight for control of the set; one slow song, one fast one, etc.  I tried twice to listen to this CD in one sitting, and couldn't get through it either time. I think true Prince fans will understand and appreciate the breadth of his talent, but when you're standing in front of your Prince collection, I seriously doubt that &quot;Rainbow Children&quot; is the one you'll reach for, in fact if it wasn't even a choice, you wouldn't miss it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I know this may not be much of a help to many of you. But most of the story would be givin away if I told you the rest. Pearl Harbor is about two best friends named Danny (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe (Ben Affleck) who always wanted, pretended and dreamed of flying every since the were kids. When they get older the both Join the U.S. Navy. Then Rafe falls in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), one of the Navy nurses. Later Rafe volunteers to help fight the war in france. <BR>Sorry I can't tell you any more of the plot becasuse I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. But I can tell you one last thing... If you're like me (totally in love with Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck) you'll love this movie because they look really cute when they were their white muscle tank top and get really sweaty.<BR>I know this wasn't a huge help. But I do hope is help some.
0316286443|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin's books never disappoint.  I always pick up a couple of little tricks here and there that I incorporate into my beauty routine.  If I want to try a new look I try to read through the parts I am most interested in.  Of course everyone loves to look at the transformations that women AND men can go through just by using makeup.  I know I show this book to lots of people and they are always completely amazed at all the before and after shots!
B00003CX5P|4.0|True Star Wars fans must have this DVD.  The movie is not as good as episodes 4-6, but it is still very good.  Leaves you wanting more!
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Have our standards for movies dropped so far that movies like this one can be made... and succeed? What were they thinking, other than &quot;hey, let's make a buck?&quot; Why would Jolie, who's done a lot better roles in her career (even snagged an Oscar for &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;), risk her good name?<br />This movie is a derivative of most every action movie ever made, namely the Indiana Jones chronicles. It's good enough for the eye candy, I guess, but if you want to see a &quot;fun&quot; movie with a lot of action, pick up &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; or even &quot;The Mummy&quot; instead. This one tried too hard to be trendy and will be hopelessley dated in five years.
0446677450|5.0|This book excels in pointing out how our current educational system and many parents fails to teach sound economic and financial principles to kids.  I have several friends who related very much with the kid with the &quot;poor dad&quot;.  They were never taught any type of basic financial principles, and it was evident in their lives.  This book helped to change that around for them, and for myself.  I strongly encourage reading this book!
B000003N7R|3.0|I came to &quot;Duke Ellington and John Coltrane&quot; because of Duke Ellington's &quot;Money Jungle&quot;, with Charles Mingus and Max Roach, another meeting of generations and one of my favorite records. Moreover, I have always loved John Coltrane's music, especially his work before &quot;Ascension&quot; (but then who doesn't ?)  Since the contrast between Duke and his sidemen had worked so incredibly well on &quot;Money Jungle&quot;, my expectations were very high. They were disappointed.<br />Don't misunderstand me: this record is good, and I'd rather hear these two play a little under their usual level than most other people at their best. The problem is not even their playing, which is fantastic, as was to be expected. To my ears, &quot;Duke Ellington and John Coltrane&quot; lacks cohesion.  Trane and Duke do not really connect: they very much play along each other. I hope I won't get too much flak for writing this, but I feel this recording is a lost opportunity.  Anyway, lots of people love it, so you should certainly give it a listen !
B00005JKES|4.0|when i heard that twin peaks was coming to dvd, i was beyond words. the instant i recived a copy i was threw it right in my player. time for episode 1. time for dead girl in the plastic and some killer cherry pie. i sit down with my cup of coffee to see previously on twin peaks. wait a sec, this is episode 1, disk 1 or the first season..... NO DEAD GIRL IN PLASTIC. now they are putting out fire walk with me and some other great lynch movies on dvd. i am sure season 2 will follow on dvd. but where is the pilot. i dont want it on vhs, i already have it on vhs. its worn out over the years of watching it. PLEASE PUT THE PILOT ON DVD!!!!<br />i really give this 3 and a half stars. its great watching it on dvd with that nice crisp picture and sound. much better then my ten year old videos with ABC ads and the such. and the intros from the log lady are a great touch. would have easily been 5 stars if not for the fact that it is missing the most important episode in the series.
6305165912|5.0|i'm not one for the oscars or any awards show, but i can't believe jeff bridges didn't get a best actor nomination for this role. i am a coen brothers fan, from everything from fargo to oh brother where at though, but i have to say this one is my favorite. john goodman does excellent work as well, with mixed up 'logic' and rants his cruel remarks to donny. it's funny that steve buscemi gets treated so badly in pretty much every coen movie.  julianne moore is a perfect, sultry weird artist. i get a kick out of her conception wish. any mood i'm in, 'the big lebowski' will get a smile out of me, and a taste for a white russian.
0525946284|5.0|This is a well scripted book - exciting - and one of the best I have read in a long time. I have been a Follett fan for many years - but have skipped several of his latest books - This one was fresh and new even though WWII is almost forgotten. His characters are great and the excitement is there by the bundle from the first page to the last - it is excellent
B00005B4GU|4.0|Chalk up #4 in a row for Radiohead (1st album Pablo Honey was just mediocre).  Just as good as Kid A.  Best tracks are Pyramid, Life in a Glasshouse, and Morning Bell.  It's great to see a good band in the Billboard Top 10.  However, I don't see  hardly anyone else good in the whole Top 100 album sales.  What else are you people buying?  Do you think Radiohead is the only one making great intellectual music? .... Whatever the case, if you like Radiohead here is a few more bands you should check out instead of Garth Brooks' greatest hits.  Mercury Rev, Sparklehorse, Snow Patrol, Neil Haggerty, Brave Captain, Simian, Air, and the ones who open for them in concert The Beta Band.  Radiohead kicks [it] in concert by the way so if you missed them, check out the live album too.
B000050XEI|3.0|I was introduced to Anya's records in 1993. I purchased three of her records, at least. She is definitely a very talented artist. But, unfortunately, I heard the same elements in every single record. The same arrangements, same musical structure, same sound, same orchestration. <BR>I wish Anya could diversify her directions in the areas of the interpretation and the styles.<BR>It is great to hear the same or almost the same music twice, after that it does not sound interesting.
B00005B4GU|4.0|There are four great reasons why anyone should like this album, and they're &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, &quot;You And Whose Army&quot;, &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot;. I say this because in these four tracks Radiohead really sound like a band, with great vocals, guitars, piano, bass and drums, all playing together. And while these songs can be appreciated individually, and would sound great in any other album or single, the other tracks in this record have to be considered as parts of a project (except for &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot;, which is a good-but-not-great tune, that seems a little misplaced in this album).
0425098478|4.0|The one minute manager is a bit of an anachronism now...when it was first published this book seemed simplistic - with recent research being published you're going to find the notion of 'a minute here' and 'a minute there' is simply not enough for the needs and motivations of different staff.  While the advice in this book is fine and you can only benefit by reading it don't assume that this book has any real answers for real mangement issues.  Any movement beyond docile staff who are satisfied with a one minute word of encouragement or 'feedback' is beyond the depth of this book.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Inida Arie's ACOUSTIC SOUL is definitely one of the most well written and produced ablums that I've listened to and brought this year. Her soulful melodic voice and easy flowing guitar creates a disposition through the album that many artist have not been able to accomplish. <BR> Arie wrote and co-wrote all but one song on the album, which is merely short of amazing for a new comer. Tracks like &quot;strength, courage and wisidom,&quot; along side of &quot;brown skin,&quot; and &quot;I see god in you,&quot; display Arie's musical and vocal ability as well as her artistic side. The hidden bonous track &quot;wonderful&quot;, which gives tribute to Stevie Wonder is also an outstandig track on the disc. If you like soul music and you like to gain some insight and feeling of depth from the music that you hear then I strongly encourage you to purchase this disk. It's merely art and will definitely move you it's simply a TREAT FOR THE SOUL.
B000002JS8|5.0|The idea of reviewing this album is actually pretty stupid.  A good rule of thumb to get through life is not to trust anyone between the ages of 19 and 48 whose arms don't get covered with goose bumps and whose feet don't start rhythmically pounding in time immediately after the opening A-A-A of the title track.<br />It's misogynist, simplistic, juvenile, and a bit proud.  It's also one of the few rock and roll albums ever to successfully capture what rock and roll really is.  Anyone who turns their nose up at this album is missing the point.  Probably responsible for more speeding tickets than any other album.<BR>In short, one of the greatest albums ever recorded, and a must for everyone who ever laughed at anyone in a position of 'authority'.<br />Underrated on the album -- If You Want Blood, You've Got It.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I was very shocked on how good this cd was.Britney surely has done her thinking on how to do a good cd.'Slave 4 u' has a catchy beat that will stay in your head that makes you wanna get up and dance.'Overprotected' has a powerful message that really relates to teen life.'Lonely' is like her old song 'stronger' that u would want to listen to after u have a break up.'Anticipating'is a little to poppy but has a good sound to it and u would listen to this if u were in a happy mood.'I love  rock and roll' is very catchy and has a edgy sound to it..'Bombastic love' and 'cinderella' have cool beats and are also very catchy.'What its like to be me' which has backup from her boyfriend justin timberlake has a rock and roll sound and you would listen to it if no one saw you for who you were.
B00005R87Q|5.0|As an active racer and loving every moment of it....of course its the people like us who will know how it really is. The movie comes close but to bad we dont have every car looking as good as that on the streets here. You have your Supra and stupp but what was funny was there was no Integra as one of the main cars.....the most widely driven import I would guess besides the civic. Anyway....A good movie to watch but you just have to remember, its still a movie.....Oh and um....yeah....Hondas rule... the hell with mustangs.
0553801481|5.0|Robin Hobb returns to the first person in this novel, continuing the compelling narrative of FitzChivalry, farseer of the Six Duchies, whose coming of age was told in the Assasins Apprentice series.  This book is extraordinary.  It has been years since I read the the Assassin's Apprentice yet the intimate first person account of Fitz's journey plunged me back into the Six Duchies like I had never left.  I was eager for more after recently finishing the Liveship Traders Series and could not have been more pleased with this personal story. This is a heart engrossing tale and a wonderfull display of character writing.  Robin Hobb's writing is beautiful but no matter the mood of the reader is never laboured. Any retelling is not awkward but suits the introspection of the main character.  I think I have a weakness for first person but I yearn for the next in this series and hope not to lose Fitz's narrative on the people I love in the Six Duchies.  Robin Hobb keeps the often strampled realm of fantasy blooming for me.  If you enjoy credibility in your fantasy don't miss this book.
B000001F76|5.0|As a boy, I recall when my sister would bring home those old MGM 78's of Hank Williams made of Metrolite.  The bright yellow label with the lion on it. This CD brings back those fond memories of one of this century's greatest singer/songwriters.  All the classics are here: Jambalaya, Hey Good Looking, Your Cheating Heart, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry, Cold, Cold Heart, Lovesick Blues etc.  It tells when they were recorded, released and features a nice booket on the life of Hank Williams.  The sound is O.K., not state-of-the-art, but when you consider most of these records are about 50 years old, you accept the fact that you have a wonderful document of  country music's greatest legend.  Well worth the value and a keeper for life.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|My daughter got this movie for Christmas. She loves it. We like to watch the movie and at the end there is a game that you can play. We love the quality of the dvd. So long vhs. I will pay the extra few bucks and and buy dvd from now on. Snow White is just as good as you remember it. Share it with your kids.
B00005RYQO|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theaters and it was so amazing the story and the graphics were so cool!  Every thing about this movie was great and i was planning on buying the videotape intil i found out it was 70.00$ i think that is way to much to pay for a 2 hour and 30 min. movie but i will be buying it after the price goes down to about 20.00$ this is defintly my favorite movie and if u havent seen it definitly go out and buy it.
1567184855|5.0|Having read several books on the topic of reincarnation, I was curious about what actually happens in the &quot;in between&quot; stage when we are not here physically on this earth. I found this book to be very insightful and thought provoking. I become more and more fascinated the more I continue to read on this subject. I found this author to be very straight forward and easy to read (as some books, like Zukav's, can be very scientific at times). I highly recommend this to others interested in the life &quot;between&quot; lives.
B00005NZBN|5.0|This album is an amazing culmination of over 30 years of brillance by Bob Dylan. Each song has it's own feeling and style, which makes it great to listen to anywhere and anytime. My particular favorite is &quot;Hard Rain&quot; with an incredible driving sound and provacative lyrics. A must own for Dylan fans - new and old alike.
0452282152|5.0|Amazing book. Couldn't put it down!!
6305327084|5.0|The premise is simple enough: a man returns home to go to his ten year high school reunion only to be confronted with the choices he and his high school friends have made. In &quot;catching up&quot; with his once tightly-knit group of friends, he takes a look at what has brought each of them to the point in there lives they are at.<br />One has chosen the traditional path of a wife, kids and a house, one man still lives in the glory days of his high school football career and cannot commit to a woman who seems to truly love him. Another is struggling to be mature and only understands what love is after he decides to let his go.<br />Then there is the main character. He is both an observer and intimately connected to both the town and the insecurities that the rest of his friends have about their lives. He falls in love with a beautiful girl - Marty (who's name is, she thinks, &quot;the bane of [her] existence&quot;) played exquisitely and painfully adolescent by a 13yr old Natalie Portman (Star Wars: Episode 1, The Professional) and he grows in the film to understand that his potential, and hers are the same.<br />All this is brought to the front of everyone's consciousness by a beautiful cousin (Uma Thurman: Pulp Fiction, The Truth About Cat's and Dogs) who is visiting and shakes everyone's reality by just being proud of herself and consistent in her morality. He also comes to understand that it is better to live in the present than in the past, and he makes a choice that we should all remember when laboring over life decisions.<br />This is a very sensitive movie if you look past the mediocre acting of both Matt Dillon and Michael Rappaport. The setting is good (I swear it was set in my town). The script is thorough, if a bit ambitious. The feeling is warm and real, if a bit fairytale with Uma's character as a Fairy God Mother. A good representation of what precedes that fabled mid-life crisis; it reminds us all that Christopher Robin finally did leave the Hundred Acer Wood he called home. He grew up.ndred Acer Wood he called home. He grew up.
0425163407|4.0|i am a fan of all Patricia Cornwells books.  i found this one very interesting and it passed the time by very fast.  i couldn't put it down.  i must agree that Kay isn't the most open with the people she loves but that is her character.  i find it easy to slip into her world where men used to rule and now she is stepping on toes.  i'm very interested in the forensic part and the actual autopsy she illustrates.  i also like how she links actual events into her stories.  for example the oklahoma city bombing, waco texas,and the unabomber.  it gives it a more real feeling.  i love these books and i slip into the complicated and fast paced world of Kay Scarpetta as often as possable.
0440214041|1.0|First and the last Grisham novel I've read. Characthers are unbelivebly thin and shallow. Grisham is a leader of a whole bunch of writers who are making action-packed novels for average guy who doesn't like too read books that make sense. <BR>All of those who belive that Darby Shaw is the most annoying character of all times have a soul mate in me.
B000001FSP|5.0|Marianne Faithfull has got it all; a personal life equalled only by a combination of Shakespeare, Jacquline Susanne, and a musical repetoire more varied and truly exceptional than nearly anyone I can presently think up. This album is, of course, the classic jewel in the crown sort of the thing.  It's incredible to me that that these songs aren't as readibly sing-able as their contemporaries.  Maybe they're too good for that. <br />As I listen to these songs over and over, I'm struck by the fact that they are all more gutsy than anything played on the radio today and probably more shocking content-wise as well. ('why'd you do it' is so much more eminem than he could ever hope to be; it's nasty AND it's smart!)That's saying something, when most songs of past revolution sound so incredibly cheesy to the moderns.<br />But I think what may be perhaps the most interesting thing about Miss Faithfull and her fabulous album is the incredibily current sound the music takes on. SOme of the songs, (Lucy Jordan in particular) are so unusual they take on (forgive me) a Madoonnna Ray of Light type currency. And I'm not talking about money. WHat I am talking about, I'm not entirely sure, but I garauntee you this album's beyond great and I Don't doubt  that you'll adore it. If you're not a total idiot, of course. but who would think that?
0618001905|5.0|This detailed yet accessible history of the colonization of the Congo is exceptionally well-written. Hochschild tells the story of the colonization of the Belgian Congo by providing a thorough biography of King Leopold II and illuminating his astounding greed at the expense of millions of lives.<br />This book was amazingly engrossing. I enjoy reading history, but I think that even a person who is not customarily drawn to history or even non-fiction would find it to be so well-written that they would thoroughly engage with this book. <br />For those of us trying to better understand modern Africa and the legacy of slavery and colonization, this is an essential read.
B0000024JA|3.0|If you're just looking to dub Bring the Pain and be on with it, don't pay full price.  However, if you're more than just an armchair listener, even by an ounce, you'll enjoy this one.  Puff and enjoy the beats and layers, or down some caffeine and hit the punching bags.  It's a great album to listen to prior to a basketball game where you're planning on kicking some major booty -- each shot you block and point you score you'll hear I bring the pain in your head.
B00005JKMO|4.0|The essence and story of Muhammad Ali is undoubtedly captivating.  It sells itself.  The Ali story is a strong framework for any filmmaker.  It can easily allow any filmmaker to grasp an opportunity for achievements and accolades that can rank with those of a movie like \\"Ghandi\\" and \\"Malcom X,\\" if not beyond them.     I naturally love the Ali story and that made me like the movie \\"Ali\\" no matter what.      However, I felt disappointed that after this asseblying an excellent cast the filmmakers ruined a chance to come up with an excellent work.  Wasted opportunity.  They reduced the story to lousy collection of events put together (or glaringly fragmented).  To me, it was just a collection of drama scenes built around lengthy fight scenes.  I still give it 4 stars for the worth of being informative.
B000002UA9|5.0|From  the opening  Paul count off (1 2 3 Vat)on  &quot;I Saw Here Standing There&quot; to the final Lennon screams on Twist and Shout, this pure  is Rock and Roll. It sounded great 40 years ago. It sounds better today. Get it !
0060975768|5.0|I've read alot of first hand accounts of combat and having been involved in it myself, I've got a good idea of what it's like. This book is an absolute page turner, I had trouble putting it down. Some of the scenes described in it are horrific and all I have to say is I'm glad I wasn't there. Read this book.
B00003CXAA|4.0|This set is pretty much a masterpiece but it's lacking a few things.  I think they should have some posters of the movie attached along with an interview with Bridget Fonda.  She is the most amazing actress ever.  Plus, they should of had something like a life size poster of Marlon Brando.  I'm not saying he should have been naked, but a poster would have done good.

B00003CX5P|2.0|...rely on the extensive documentaries/featurettes (disc 2) to help convince yourself that this film has 'some' redeeming value...   <br />the excessive quantity of dvd extras (actually more entertaining/intriguing than the movie itself) tries to dazzle/numb you into forgeting/rationalizing your profound disappointment in the movie...   <br />so maybe it's a rough start, but bringing star wars up to speed with 'contemporary action/sci-fi movie standards' and 'expectation pressures' (especially from the SW over-intellectualizers) is a pretty formidable task.<br />be wary tho and try to ignore the sickeningly profuse lucas kow-tow-ing by his legion of payroll sycophants/workhorse zombies.<br />tho Quantity over quality is the essence of this dvd, how can i turn my back completely on someone responsible for so much of my childhood joy?<br />all starwars fans are forever indebted to lucas for the cherished memories...  it's his story, after all.
B00003XB8K|3.0|I loved the other Enigma albums.  This one is okay, I'd probably buy it again but it's not as sensual and mood-evoking as the others.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Follow the story of Shrek, an dissapointed Orge, who would be left alone. When Lord Farquaad, (Voiced by John Lithgow, sends fairy tale characters (Snow White, Pinocchio,etc) in Shrek's swamp, Shrek is determinded to go to Lord Farquaad, and request that he remove the creatures he dumped into the ogre's swamp. The set contains 2 versions of the movie, fullscreen and widescreen, also with interactive games for your computer (DVD-Rom Drive needed) The only negitive remark I have is that on the Menus the Gingerman's legs break either way (Left= Left leg breaks, Right= Right leg Breaks)
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This isn't about the film that you may have seen in theaters, it's about the new &quot;bootleg&quot; director's cut.<br />This is a must own DVD. For the music fan. For the movie fan. For fans of great commentary tracks, extra footage, etc.<br />It's one of those titles that you'll want to watch when friends come over just to show them the commentary track with his mother, along with the 36 minutes of footage that was seamlessly put back into the film.<br />Having seen the new cut, it now makes my list as one of the best films I've ever seen. I hope it finds the audience in video that it deserved while it was in theaters.<br />I've already sold my Jerry Maguire bare-boned dvd and Say Anything laserdisc in anticipation of the rumored special edition dvds of those two titles. Hopefully Cameron will also go back to Singles and give that the treatment it deserves as well. Vanilla Sky is as remarkable. I think it's about time that audiences go to see his films because he's involved (not because Tom Cruise is in it, etc.)
0385484518|4.0|I read Tuesdays With Morrie, in my 20th century literature class. Most people in my class disliked the book, as I enjoyed it. I love reading true biographies and finding out interesting facts about their life. Mitch was influenced by an old college professor if his, Morrie. The book made me realize that certain people in our lives leave such a huge impact that you don't realize they have.  Mitch was forever changed by Morrie and his &quot;Life's Greatest Lessons.&quot;
0553579908|1.0|A friend recommended this series to me, but after reading the first and second books, I will read no further and will not heed any more recommendations from that friend. This story is a brutally violent, totally unsympathetic monstrosity that I am shocked anyone would enjoy. Recommending this series to anyone who isn't completely prepared for explicit, detailed descriptions of rape, murder of childen, torture, and mutilation is like recommending &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; to your grandparents.<br />Without going into specifics so as not to spoil the story for anyone making the mistake of reading this book, suffice it to say that reading &quot;A Song of Fire and Ice&quot; is like staring at roadkill on the highway. If it makes you sick, you will hate this story. If you look at roadkill and snicker, then this series is perfect for you.
0060278234|5.0|Hmmm... I don't think I spelt &quot;unforgettable&quot; right, but hey - my memory isn't fabulous.  Though despite a poor memory, I don't think I could ever forget this novel.  <BR>In one word: Amazing, and in two: absolutely fabulous.<BR>I can't be bothered giving a whole, massive, in depth summary of the plot - If you want that, then look somewhere else!  This novel was pure magic, for it captured me and didn't let go.  Even after months of not reading it, I'm still reminiscing and considering as to whether or not I'll read it once more.<BR>This novel is a work of art; If you stare at it long enough, then you realise just how intricate it really is.  I loved this book, for everything.  This novel is an active adventure/fantasy that moves at an incredible rate.  It is not necessary to read Sabriel beforehand, though it does give you a better insight towards some of the characters.<BR>I found this a great read, suitable for many different ages, and certainly different people.  A joyride of adventure - I just can't wait for &quot;Abhorsen&quot; - you'll never want to put &quot;Lirael&quot; down!
B00005RDSM|5.0|Disney's \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of their most enchantingly delightful animated features, telling the story of how Peter Pan whisked Wendy, John, and Michael off to his home in Never Land for a magical adventure none of them would ever forget fighting Captin Hook and his ruthless band of pirates.<br />Although the original 1999 \\"Limited Issue\\" DVD lacked bonus features (with the only one being the option to watch the movie in French), fans of the film have been rewarded for waiting with this Special Edition. The movie looks better then it did on any previous release, and that's reason enough to buy this masterpiece. But the extra features -- oh! True, this disc pales in comparison to the Platinum Edition release of \\"Snow White\\" (unfortunately \\"Peter Pan\\" is NOT one of the nine other Platinum Editions to be issued over the next decade) but for one disc I'd say they did a pretty nice job. \\"You Can Fly: The Making of Peter Pan\\" was also provided on the 1998 45th Anniversary Limited Edition VHS, but it's worthy of another watch. After seeing the movie again, start with that, and then see the wonderful 13-minute 1952 promotional featurette \\"The Peter Pan Story.\\" They're even more exellent when viewed together.<br />Next, head back to the movie, but turn on the audio commentary this time. Hosted by Roy E. Disney, it provides some really amazing information on the film I never knew before. Other commentators include Walt Disney himself (pieced together from old interviews, etc.), some of his Nine Old Men, other vetran animators, Kathryn Beaumont (who provided Wendy's voice in the feature), and of course noted film critic Lenoard Multin, among others.  Next, take a few minutes to examine the vast visiual gallery.  Wonderful stuff in there for fans and casuial viewers alike.<br />The bonuses aimed at kids are worth a look too. The best by far was the \\"Following the Leader\\" sing-along, although it looked a bit dull (not being taken from the newly restored version of the film, butan older one), and the Pirate Treasure Hunt game was fun, if too easy. The DVD storybook was AWFUL, though, attempting to create a new story out of the animation that was already created for the original movie. If that sounds confusing, don't worry, don't bother with the feature. Another note: Why couldn't they have put a \\"You Can Fly\\" sing along on the disc as well? There was a Sing Along videotape devoted to that one as the title tune, so a version does exsist. I'dve much prefered it over \\"Following the Leader,\\" but really would've liked both. Oh well.<br />Lastly, there's a new trailer for \\"Return to Never Land\\" (NOT either of the theatrical ones; this one has some really great new footage) that's worth a look before you go see the movie. And if you buy this before March 31, your child will get in free -- as an extra bonus, there's one free child's admission movie ticket for \\"Return\\" inside every Special Edition DVD and video.<br />In addition to all this, new trailers show that among others \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\\" will make it to DVD this year (finally) in October for the former and May for the latter. Great news, I think. Plus there's a really cute Disney TV spot called \\"Magic Happens\\" on the second menu of trailers.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful DVD -- much better then the Limited Issue edition -- and I'm glad to own it. Something you shouldn't miss! ***** (5/5)
B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie captures none of the mythical story that was star wars.  It does not deserve the name Star Wars.  It represents a perversion of one of the greatest stories of our life time.  I don't understand what happened.  Why did he do this?  Oh Lucas!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you have never seen this movie and are a little questionable about buying it, don't hesitate! This is the best movie I have ever seen. The drama and suspence keeps you at the edge of your seat. A wonderful musical and a all in all great movie. The music is the best of our time all mixed together.
B00005JKES|4.0|The biggest fault of this set is the omission of the pilot episode.  Boo to the publishers who force fans to either remember what happened 10 years ago or scramble to find a copy at the local Blockbuster.  What made it worse is that the set was published even though the pilot is not available domestically on DVD.  Aside from that, the show still entertains and has captivated my wife who never watched it.  Now she is crying for more.  I just hope the second set doesn't omit any episodes.
B00000I924|5.0|Simply put the album Who Else! speaks for itself. I don't think there is anyone who has come close to playing a guitar as good as Jeff Beck. To me Who Else is the best album he has ever made. In this album he plays like an alien from another planet. All the songs are awesome. If you are a big beck fan I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend
B00005JKQX|5.0|I just saw &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; today. I was expect a monotonous film about a mathematician. What I saw was a story of a brillant man. Russell Crowe should win the Oscar for this. His portrayal of the troubled schizophrenic genius John Nash is absolutely mind-blowing. Jennifer Connelly is also terrific as Nash's husband. She should get an Oscar nod, which I'm sure she will. I was truly touched by this movie. It was flawless in every way. The acting was wonderful, the writing was great (there were some quite funny parts), and many other things made this movie great. I was touched by this film, and after you see it, I'm sure you will be too. I'm a 14 year old boy and I enjoyed this thoroughly. It was great!
B00005QZWI|3.0|This soundtrack baffled me on a few levels. I wanted it to take me away, and at times it did. However, the greater portion of the score seemed trite and pre-owned if you will. It not only smacked heavily of Williams (kudos to the earlier reviewer's comment regarding &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; - although the argument can be made that any heavy, neo-Wagnerian vocal film score is going to smack of &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;) but it also resembled so many works by other prominent theatrical composers such as James Horner and John Barry. I found that &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; and &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; were the only pieces that really served to create a new sound. They was moving. I only wish the rest of the score could have been so refreshing.<BR>An aside - I appreciate the songs being sung in Elvish. Tells you how absolutely amazing the story is. It actually resulted in its own languages.

068484267X|5.0|It's a miracle that any member of the McCourt family survived their poverty and the rampant diseases of the time.<br />I have been an avid book reader my whole life, and I would include Angela's Ashes in my list of top twenty.<br />I listened to this book on tape, and hearing the author tell his own story was an indescribably moving experience. There is nothing like listening to Frank McCourt imitate the voices of his teachers, relatives and priests. It was impossible to stem the tears when McCourt described the ever-present hunger stalking the family, the useless father, the no-heart grandmother and aunt, the deaths of his sister and brothers. And I laughed out loud as grown-up McCourt inhabited his younger self to report on the always-puzzling behavior of the adults in his life.<br />Even if you have already read the book, I urge you to obtain it on tape.
B00005LC1H|5.0|British television is an aquired taste. From Mr.Bean to Monty Pythin, many americans simply don't get british humor. If you are one of those americans, click the back button and never gaze upon this page again. Fawlty Towers is full of sarcastic Wit, stinging putdowns, and great physical comedy.  THe cast is comprised of a spanish speaking bellboy, a stubborn and quick witted serving girl/maid, a talkative, gruff hotel owner, and her hsuband the ssharp tongued master of improvisation. The whole cast plays their parts perfectly and delivers fntastic dialogue. Similar to the monty python dead parrot sketch, the pace is frantic and actions are spastic. All the while with dialogue whirling by at amazing speeds. However teh episodes do take a while to get to the is point. Most of them move pretty slowly unti lteh story gets set up and things start going wrong. For a big british comedy fan this is fine as the first part of the episodes are still very funny. However for the casual enjoyer, ie Mr. Bean lovers only, then try and catch the show on pbs or rent it before you buy it. If you like &quot;are you being served&quot;, or really like the old &quot;monty Python&quot; series, then go steal this, or buy it, NOW!.
B00000HYXB|5.0|The best (in my opinion, of course) album of Blind Guardian. Most of the action of Silmarillion rewritten in poetry, plus cool power - metal music. That's what the tigers like!!!
6305165912|5.0|This is a Coen Brothers movie which means it is definately not for everyone. If you dislke heavy swearing, avoid this movie like the plague. If you dislike drug use run for your life. IF you dislike nudity/pornography, then you must hate swearing as well ,so why are you still reading this. Any way, this movie is heavy on vice, thats not what its about, but there is a lot of it. You can read a synopsis above so i won't go into that. Instead I'll talk about the disc.  THe movie is very good looking.  the blacks are black and the colors are vivid. THe sound is also VERY good. You can even hear little chunks of tile fall bac kdown after a bowling ball is dropped on teh bathroom floor, great for the ears. Both widescreen and standard are on this disc, so everyone is happy there. Extras- teh interview with the coens is boring. Don't get me wrong i really like the coens, but the interview is very slow and unintersting. other than that there isnt much. But you don't need it. this movie is a masterpiece of character development, scriptwriting, and cinematography. Very underecognized, it is cast perfectly and all the actors do a fantastic job for their parts. Why john goodman and Jefff bridges weren't recognized at the academy awards i dunno. Snooty bastards. Anyways this movie is dark at times, has a lot of drinkign and smoking in it, and swearing, a whole load of swearing. But if you can stomach all that the movie is fantastic. It's got a fargo sense to it, but is mixed with a lightheartedness, like hudsucker proxy or o brother where art thou. If you like the cohen brothers go ahead and buy this now, don't even consider not pulling out your creidt card. Otherwise you should rent this one first. Even if you hate the movie, teh acting is reason enough to give this one a rent, so do it, or else.
B00005OWIU|3.0|I just reviewed another John Williams soundtrack, A.I.  In it, I said that the quality of the soundtrack proved that JW can still innovate with the best of them.  <br />However, although I like this soundtrack, it is very typical John Williams.  After catching part of the music in one of the promo trailers at the theater, I noted to a friend that it was very easy for me to tell that John Williams had written it.<br />It's very much like what he has already written, which, if you enjoyed that, is very good.  It's just that the themes are very familiar.  <br />I think my favorite tracks are Harry's Wondrous World and Hedwig's Theme, but even here, I enjoy them because they are typical, in the sweeping grandeur style of John Williams.<br />If you like that style, however, I would advise you buy it.
B00003CXBK|4.0|This was the first anime movie i had ever seen. I bought it because the cover was bitchn' and it was cheap. So i am by no means a huge anime fan, i mostly just like big robots, but this movie, I like. The animation is excellent; very clean and smooth, no real strange or shaky character animations or over the top anime faces ( ie huge mouths and tear drops over the head). The movie is very interesting if a little confusing at times. In fact I didn't really get it until i'd seen it 3 times. Tho there is blood, a lto of blood by american animated standards, but pretty normal fair as far as anime goes. A few guys lose some body parts as well ,but it's nothing too horrible. The picture is clear and crisp, the sound, while not astounding, is very good. It has a Japanese and English voice track, tho i prefer the english. The voices match the characters very well.<br />Overall the movie is very excellent. The story is well written and enthralling. Not jsut for anime fans by any means.  So if you enjoy fantasy movies, with lotsa action this film is definatelly a winner. Don't let the fact that this film is animated fool you into thinking it's full of mindless fluff and gore. Mononoke is truly a gem.
B00005QZWI|4.0|There are some movies out there where the soundtrack is the best part of the movie.  Having bought this CD prior to seeing the movie, I was afraid that would be the case here, as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the CD -- and then I saw the movie.<br />Now I love the soundtrack even more.  This music goes along with the movie perfectly.  Sometimes a really good soundtrack can overpower a movie.  Howard Shore did a great job of integrating it so that did not happen.  The truly glorious things in Middle Earth were backed by glorious music, and the truly horrible things backed by scary, ominous music.  Simply wonderful.<br />Also, Enya's ending song is beautiful.  Buy this CD and enjoy it thoroughly!
B00005MAM2|4.0|In every genre there is a defining movie. A movie that every person interested i nhat type of film has seen, whether they love it or hate it. Akira is one such film. Probobly not good for beginning anime fans, in other words, once you are aware of more anime than sailor moon, pokemon and dragn ballz go out and rent this [one].  I don't think this movie is as awesome as it gets credit for, but it is certainly cool.... The animation is very bright and clean. Very pretty, the motorcycle chase scenes are fantastic.  The sound is great as well, and i love the soundtrack to this movie. The extras are pretty interesting and you get to see the process of restoring ht efilm and bringing it back to life from the faded negatives. The film contains some pretty graphic violence and light nudity. But overall the concept is very cool and the movie is very well made. It starts a little slow if all your watching it for is huge monster things, but it is well worth a rent. Word of warning the ending is a mind bender type of thing. Its kind of a \\"you interpret what it means thing\\" so if you dont like those then BEWARE. I'm not too experienced in anime so i cant think of anything akira is similar to, sorry. Go out and rent it, or read the comics, before you buy this. If your a big anime fan, buy it straight up. whether you love it or hate it Akira is more than a movie, its an anime institution
B00005JKHP|4.0|Ever need to convince someone DVD is better than VHS?  All you need is this DVD and a copy of the &quot;Special Longer Version&quot; on tape.  Case closed.<BR>I have always liked the first Star Trek movie and now I feel like I have to be a little less defensive about that.  The movie still has a grand scope (the other movies always seemed to me more like expanded episodes... not in a bad way), but it has been tightened up tremendously.  And the sound effects are a real improvement.  I always hated the dead silence on the bridge of the Enterprise.  The new effects are very well integrated into the footage and unless you know what to look for, I don't think you'll see much difference in the &quot;feel&quot; of them versus all the other effects.<BR>The &quot;extras&quot; on the second DVD are pretty lame except for the few scenes of the never-produced &quot;Phase II&quot; Star Trek show.  I would have liked more in the way of documentaries of the making of the movie (and I could have sworn I saw a couple way back when on TV when this movie was first coming out).  Anyway, if you like the movie, definitely get this DVD.  And with the way this movie was treated, I am not going to be buying the other Star Trek DVD's until they are brought up to this standard.
B000021Y77|5.0|A must see. (But only in German with subtitles)  A beautiful young woman (Potente) must save her boyfriend from thugs by coming up with 100,000 dollars.  The catcher of this one is the movie is divided into thirds.  It shows her being a few seconds ahead, a few behind and on time and how just a second or two can affect a persons whole life.  The pace is exhausting and the techno is thumping as you are submersed in a world of multi-angle camera shots, animation and dazzling editing.  Following Potente through 20 minutes (x3) of her world is sheer exhilaration.
1859849296|3.0|Like Hitchens' other books, this one is a feat of intellectual integration, coming at the topic from a direction few might think to take. It has probably set a lot of blood to boiling. Not being one of the &quot;Teresa cult,&quot; and taking a jaundiced view of her flaunting of &quot;humility,&quot; I found it enlightening, though sad. One does want to believe that it is the poor, and not their &quot;helpers'&quot; self-promoting sanctity, to which one is contributing. To find that the former are admittedly a mere vehicle for the latter is depressing--as is the information that it is not the orders' poverty that deprives its &quot;beneficiaries&quot; of antibiotics or relief from pain.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Sometimes things aren't always as they appear.  This seems to be the case for Guy Pierce as he tries to solve the raping/murder of his wife.  His only problem:  He is unable to form new memories.  The people who are out to help Pierce in his quest are Matrix alums Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano.  The genius of this film lies in it's directing.  To get the idea of being unable to hold a memory for more than 5 minutes the story is told BACKWARDS in 5 minute increments.  That way you piece things together just as he does.  The film is flawless.  My only complaint with the DVD is that there isn't a special feature where you can put everything forwards.
6304233639|2.0|You're going to love this movie if:<br />  1) You like explosions<br />  2) Head-butting an alien is your idea of humor<br />  3) You know absolutely nothing about computers or data<br />You'll also probably like it if you're able to completely suspend your thinking processes during viewing.<br />The acting's not bad, and the effects are top-notch. Too bad the story is so inane.<br />It would be pretty stirring if the solutions to the plot complications weren't so ridiculous. Everything was fine for the first hour. The closure to the film was just slack-jaw goofy.<br />I find it hard to believe that there are many people who haven't seen this very hyped film, but if they exist, I recommend you leave this one one the shelf. If you want to see an action movie with humor that is worth suspending your brain for, rent &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Ron Howard made an entertaining film, but opted to change the chronolgy of many events, completely omit others and substantially change facts. There is no mention of Elenor and John Strier, his first girlfriend and firstborn son. He never goes to RAND in California and thus is never arrested in a sting to nab homosexuals. John's trips to Europe and his attempts to give up his US citizenship is never depicted. His son Johnny's battle with Schizophrenia is omitted. His divorce from Alicia is also never mentioned. It is understandable that some changes were made in the screenplay, but the movie only resembles his real life in a vague way.
B00003CWL6|4.0|I thought it would be worth writing about the mixed reception this film has gotten.  Some love it, some hate it.  It generally splits along male/female lines, but there are plenty of exceptions to that, so rule out a simple guy/chick flick distinction.<br />The movie has a number of disturbing elements, and I think these are at the core of the differing reviews.  Consider these:<br />  An older guy with a teenage girl<BR>  A likable character that is also a drug dealer<BR>  The failure of an idealize American family<BR>  A highly materialistic yet unsuccessful real estate agent<BR>  Extramaterital sex from the wife, and not from the husband<BR>  A successful guy in a job quits, despite family obligations<BR>  A young girl who has mastered manipulation with her good looks<BR>  A stereotypical Marine Corp father that you would like to like<br />If you don't like movies with 'bad' endings, this movie lets you know at the beginning that you are in for it.  Add to this a litany of issues that it presents, and there's little doubt some people will simply give up on this film in the middle.  They will not find anything redeeming or even interesting in it, and they may even want to turn it off before it ends.<br />But there's a rub.  There are lots of movies like this, including Gone With the Wind.  And they don't exhibit this kind of mixed response.  And that's where the difference is most noticable between this film and the others.  Its the specifics of the issues that the movie presents that cause people problems, not just the apparent negative overall plot or story line.<br />I think this film simply hits too close to home for some people.  I'm not suggesting that people are denying they are really like these characters.  But this movie more than suggest that what passes for the American dream, that of a good job, with home and family, may not be enough for everyone, not without some serious soul searching.  That's disturbing, and maybe its a message some people won't want to hear. <br />For others of us, its something we suspected or have known all along.  I don't mean that we would pass up a good job, and that  home and family aren't good things, they just may not be enough without some kind of strife.  The movie is refreshing in the way it exposes and acknowledges this, and even though we must endure a spectical of several people that have to deal with loss and change, they generally do find redemption.  And if they don't find redemption, we as the audiance can see they had the opportunity for it.  Because of this, we are uplifted.<br />My suggestion is to watch the movie and don't pass judgement on it until its over.  Then watch it again.  Its best to remember that is just a movie, and not real life.  Real life is boring and you don't want a movie about real life.  Listen to the score, and try and enjoy the better moments of the film, and ignore or overlook those that disturb you.  If you are lucky, like myself and many others, you will get a positive feeling of acknowledgement throughout the movie, and redemption at the end.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Three discs, three hours, four of the world's best musicians joined by an amazing vocalist, a hypnotherapist, and a gospel choir.  What do you get when you combine these things?  You get the greatest live experience mankind has given us.  Dream Theater, the gods of prog., have released their second (or is it third?) live album, and it delivers.  Included in this package is the masterpiece that is &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, in all its glory, duplicated to near perfection.  At times, you will forget that this is a live album, and think that you are just listening to the album.  It's all there, the technical wizardry, the emotional moments, even the narrations.  Perfection.  There's even a guitar solo added in right before &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot;, and a reprise of &quot;One Last Time&quot; added into &quot;Finally Free&quot;, which makes it that much longer, and maybe a little better.<br />After &quot;Scenes..&quot;, it's not over, in fact it's not even half over.  They immediately follow that with &quot;Metropolis Part 1&quot;, and continue with several other of their great songs, including an exerpt of the Liquid Tension Experiment song &quot;Acid Rain&quot;, followed by a medley of &quot;New Millenium&quot; and &quot;Caught in a Web&quot;. Disc 2 ends on an especially high note, with a 6-minute solo from Jordan Rudess.  He is truly a great keyboardist, easily the best in rock, and possibly one of the best since Mozart.  He starts off with some concert piano type stuff, which is just breathtaking, and then he turns on the effects, and starts doing trippier, spacier stuff.  Very cool.<br />Disc 3  may seem short when glancing at the tracklisting, but it is actually over an hour of music.  It includes the &quot;Mind Beside Itself&quot; trilogy, &quot;Learning to Live&quot;, and &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;.  I'd say this is the weakest disc, because IMO these songs (except for &quot;Seasons&quot;, which I haven't really listened to enough) are not their best work.  But, not by any means bad.  This is still great music, just not as riveting as the first two discs.  At the end, one of the members (possibly Mike) sarcastically says &quot;Sorry for the short set&quot;, and with that, the greatness is over.  This album is great, one every rock/metal fan should own.  It is absolutely perfect, rivaled only by Iced Earth's &quot;Alive in Athens&quot;.  The only thing it's missing is a drum solo from Mike, but oh well.  I don't recommend this as an alternative to buying &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, because then you don't get the lyrics with the cast of characters and all that (which is a vital aspect of the album), but once you get it, buy this to see how it translates live, and the reactions of the audience.  Well, I've gone on long enough.  Buy this album, you'll be glad you did.ir best work.  But, not by any means bad.  This is still great music, just not as riveting as the first two discs.

B00005JKQX|5.0|'A Beautiful Mind' is easily the best film of the year 2001.  Spearheaded by a wonderful performance from Russell Crowe, this film is a masterpiece from director Ron Howard.  It is about Nobel prize winner Dr. John Nash, who wrote a Nobel prize winning theory during his college days, but was seriously affected by schizophrenia later.  During all his struggle, his wife (played by Jennifer Connelly) stood by him.  <br />Russell Crowe plays Dr. Nash with consummate ease, effortlessly portraying his youth as well as his troubled schizophrenic days.  Jennifer Connelly has supported him admirably as his wife and Ed Harris is as solid as a rock.  Ron Howard's direction is very good, with the film starting slowly and then the tempo increases and peaks at the ending.  All the supporting actors, especially Adam Goldberg and Paul Bettany, deserve praise for their beleivable portrayals and they make each frame of this film worth watching.<br />Russell Crowe has always been a good actor with excellent performances in 'L.A. Confidential' and 'The Insider', but in this film, he has taken his acting to a newer, more mature level.  It will hardly be a surprise if he bags his second Academy award for this performance.
B000002B7M|5.0|When Ozzy left Black Sabbath, I would imagine that many thought that all was lost.  But, in 1980, two albums relinquished that worry.  One was Sabbath's &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, and the other was &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;.  Yes, Ozzy had embarked on a solo career, and Ronnie James Dio was keeping the Sabbath torch burning.  Regardless of what you may think about the Dio stuff (I love it, personally), it is doubtful that anyone will mourn Ozzy's departure upon listening to this.  &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, the debut of guitar wizard Randy Rhoads.  This guy just had a style of playing that is unmatched.  Some of the stuff he did, you just say to yourself, &quot;How in the hell does he do that?&quot;.  He was amazing, just listen to &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, and you'll know what I mean.  Even the greatest of guitarists would scratch their heads at this song's insane solos.  But, it doesn't stop there.  You've also got other great guitar rock type songs, like &quot;I Don't Know&quot; and &quot;Steal Away (The Night)&quot;, great ballads like the touching &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot;, the eerie &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;, and the epic &quot;Revelation (Mother Earth)&quot;, and even a little acoustic instrumental.  In fact, nearly every song on here is a classic (except for &quot;No Bone Movies&quot;, which really should have been left off).  For the longest time, this was Ozzy's greatest album (I think &quot;No More Tears&quot; is better, but that's me), and every metal fan should own it.  It's just too bad that Randy's life ended.  He had such a great career ahead of him.  Rest in peace, man.
B00003CXTF|4.0|It was an entertaining movie.  The actors are probably better known to the current generation than to those of us in our eighth decade.  Like many movies today, the producers seem to be trying hard to be &quot;realistic.&quot;  The love story is complicated by the erroneous report of one of the hero's death, and so his girl falls for someone else and, naturally, gets impregnated at the first opportunity.  The actual attack on Oahu is depicted as a frenetic two hours in which the Japanese were virtually unchallenged, and their bombs wreaked devastation unparalled in the annals of warfare.  A single bomb often destroyed a hangar or battleship.<br /><br />Roosevelt is played by an actor with bug-eyes who didn't quite carry it off, and who referred to over 3,000 victims lost, when actually the count was nearer 2,000.<br /><br />Actually, the Japanese lost nearly ten percent of their aircraft, either shot down by our planes or with anti-aircraft fire.  It wasn't a walk in the park for them.<br /><br />Pearl Harbor devastated the United States Pacific fleet.  Twenty-one of our ships were sunk or disabled.  However, all but three of them were repaired and recommissioned before the war ended.<br /><br />The actors who are youthful enough to play the parts required in such a movie, based on events that happened sixty years ago, are not qualified by life experience to depict people of that generation realistically.  They don't speak the same language, and they are far too urbane.<br /><br />If war movies are your cup of tea, this was a good one.  The visual effects were startling.  It was generally over-acted, but one expects that.<br /><br />Perhaps it's time to put that war behind us.  It cannot truly be recaptured, except using films made at the time from gun cameras and through the lenses of combat photographers who were there.<br /><br />At least, in this one, they didn't use the standard footage of a flight our good old SBD Douglas &quot;Dauntless&quot; dive bombers, pretending they were Japanese dive bombers as most Pearl Harbor movies do.  Every time I see that, I see red.<br /><br />All in all, it was an impressive dramatic movie.<br /><br />Joseph H.

6305079811|5.0|A great movie for Sci-Fi lovers! It has it all; an evil sadistic ruler from outer-space(Max von Sydow); the beautiful, helpless lady in distress(Melanie Anderson); and the only person that could possibly save the Earth, our hero, Flash Gordon(Sam J. Jones).<br />I loved it. I admit, it's not exactly Star Wars, but it's a good, fun, sci-fi adventure.<br />This movie, in my opinion, speaking as a father, is for older audiences. Contains bloody violence, and sensuality.

B00005QXXO|3.0|Let me first say I am very fond of Radiohead and I believe all their work is deservant of more than a 3 but this live album does not live up to expectations. First of all, this album is too short, it seems lacking by the time you reach the end. And I know its an Ep but for the price of a lp we should get equivelent length. Second of all, and I understand this album is promoting there two recent albums, I would of really enjoyed some older songs but thats is not too bad of a mistake. But perhaps including songs such as  &quot;optimistic&quot;, &quot;pyrimid song&quot;, &quot;How to disspaear&quot; and &quot;knives out&quot; would of been greatly appreciated. But the songs that are included on the ep are mastered well and sound very fresh. It stars out ordinarilly enough with their show-opening &quot;National Anthem&quot; which never seems to get old. &quot;I might be wrong&quot; is iffy but it is relieved by the following &quot;morning bell&quot; and &quot;like spinning plates.&quot; The following version of &quot;Idiotheque&quot; includes an seemenly annoying blip (you know what I am refering to when you here it) but the song has now turned into one of my favorite versions of the song. The much sampled &quot;everything in its right place&quot; and beautiful &quot;true love waits&quot; sandwich what I feel is a weak choice for this album with &quot;Dollars and Cents.&quot; Length though is really what keeps this from being a good represention of Radiohead's amazing live act.
B000021XS0|5.0|As is the case with some of the negative reviewers, I am a music student - theory/composition, actually. The only reason that I can come up with for the number of negative reviews on Dream Theater (and this album in particular) is that any time some people hear extremely fast playing, no matter how much inspiration and musical erudition is behind it, they call it mechanical or robotic - probably because the reviewer can't play something like that with the same facility themselves. Music doesn't have to be \\"imperfect\\" to be human or moving; moreover, \\"perfect\\" shouldn't enter into the picture, as music is an art and not a science. It needs to go somewhere better than a quantitative perfection, and I really do believe that DT has done it in most spots on this album. More on that later.<br />The pianist Arcadi Volodos plays fast... really fast actually. His touch is gorgeous. Would you call him mechanical because he doesn't make mistakes? You have an inferiority complex if you would. One of the things that make these guys great is that they not only know what they want to hear, and can play it, but they hear what everyone else is trying to play, and play that too. Since they have the brains and background to do it, more power to them. I believe that most of these negative reviewers just can't accept that music can be made at this level, in this nether region of the mind, where technical considerations aren't even a question.<br />As far as the guy who said that the music was harmonically boring, go ahead and try analyzing Dance of Eternity. I transcribed it and analyzed it myself. That piece is every bit as architectonic as the first movement of many Beethoven piano sonatas: compression, augmentation, retrograde form, mensuration canon, motivic development, modulation through octatonic scales - they're all there in just that one tune. Unless you actually know what notes are going on, and their significance in the scheme of the form, I think you should keep quiet on thecompositional/theoretical criticisms.<br />To those who contend that this music is uninspired: please give a listen to Bach Cantatas BWV 127 & BWV 133, Mozart Piano Concertos K 466 & K 488, and any Cesar Franck organ work. I think you'll hear the same touch of divinity (especially from the formal standpoint) in DT's songs on this album as those great composers exercised. Hopefully then you'll hear where these guys are coming from. This album is an incredible work of art, and as long as you keep your ears open and your mind inquisitive, it will yield something new every time you listen to it.
B0000508U6|4.0|Now let me say now, I save 5 star reviews for truly great albums. This is not as revolutionary as say an OK Computer, but nethertheless it is still an great album. Coldplay displays their masterery for slow-winding accoustic ballads here with the occasional rocker. The album start with the amazing (albiet TOO SHORT) &quot;Don't Panic&quot; and then continues to the emotion packed and my personal favorite &quot;Shiver.&quot; (Which happens to be one of the few true rock songs on the album, not that thats a bad thing) As for &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot;, they are great songs despite their harsh overplayment. (is overplayment a word?, get back to me on that one) They are conviently layed next to each other on the album for easy skipability. Unfortuatly, they fall short with the songs &quot;sparks&quot; and &quot;high speed&quot; which are obviously filler. Despite these small downfalls, <BR>&quot;Parachutes&quot; is a breath of fresh air after listening to today's modern rock scene and is truely on of the greatest albums of 2000.(Just behind &quot;Kid A&quot;, WhoHoo, Go Radiohead!) I can easily see myself still enjoying these songs for years to come and you should too by listening to this album.
B000001FTA|3.0|Thin Lizzy was okay, a journeyman rock ('n roll) band with a lot of killer riffs that lifted only occasionally memorable tunes. Their big claim to fame in the US was &quot;The Boys Are Back In Town,&quot; which in 1976 sounded like Bruce Springsteen meets heavy metal. The Springsteen comparison gave Thin Lizzy and bassist/lead singer/group leader Phil Lynott momentary cache on FM playlists at that time, but it didn't last and Lynott eventually died at a very young age after several years of alcohol overindulgence.<br />BAD REPUTATION is pretty much generic Seventies arena rock, with two song exceptions. One is &quot;Dancing In The Moonlight,&quot; another Springsteen clone which owes a lot to The Boss' &quot;Spirit In The Night.&quot; The tune swings and it's one of the few instances where Lynott's lyrics actually go beyond cliches and say something. The other is a ballad, &quot;Downtown Sundown,&quot; a folkish (but still electric) song of affirmation that, gender considerations apart, I could hear someone like Roseanne Cash or Gillian Welch pulling off. Lynott himself sings it with grace and a sort of rough compassion in his voice. Again, his lyrics hit home.<br />I don't know if two really great songs is enough of a basis for buying a whole album, but you could do much worse.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I cannot say that I was RW's biggest fan, but I can admit that I am about to become one.  The album rarely leaves my CD player since its release and I can feel RW's genuine affection for this music everytime I listen to it.  It is apparent that he is not trying to be another Sinatra, Sammy or Dean, the album seems more like an outcome of the admiration of a talented man for this great music.  <BR>I also loved the British tone to it.  A big applause for &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, &quot;Me and my shadow&quot; and &quot;Mr.Bojangles&quot; just to name a few.  This is a great chance for the young ones not be deprived of this great music which I've been admiring since my childhood(I am 23)... Congratulations for this wonderful album.  Perfect timing, by the way.
B00005LOUP|4.0|I knew Carey would be the perfect Grinch.  No other actor couldve played that role. The little girl was sooooo adorable I wanted to reach through the screen and hug her!<br />Its plot is a little lacking. Seems like a lot of it is filling in time. But the picture is sharp and colors bright. Reminds me of a Tim Burton movie - Batman returns in particular.<br />Oh did I say how cute the girl is?
B00005JKES|2.0|I love Twin Peaks as a show, but the lack of a pilot, when nothing in the package indicated its lack, was a sad surprise.  However having the next 7 episodes in a single collection is still cool, I suppose...<br />...but the disappointment doesn't stop there.  The menus are counterintuitive and some of the lettering and fonts on the extras are difficult to read and hard on the eyes.  One of the extras is deceptively titled &quot;Introduction to David Lynch&quot;.  This extra is merely interviews with some of the Twin Peaks cast and critics *about* David Lynch; he's not there at all - and when they refer to specific scenes in Twin Peaks or Lynch's other works, they didn't even include clips.  I suppose it's a rights issue but again, disappointing.<br />On the flip side, the extra with the &quot;Twin Peaks Directory&quot; not only contained no spoilers from later episodes on the show, it clearly stated this fact up front.  While I am sure that such a setup will annoy some fans who know the series backwards and forwards, it's nice that the 2nd season will not be spoiled for folks who are new or who have forgotten much of the series.<br />Finally, last and worst, the transfer was soft; I saw a lot of rainbows in the first two episodes, and in places, it seemed out of focus.  This was on a Sony NS400P player too.  I have watched very few DVDs that looked so poor, which is a shame considering that a lot of the power of the series is in its imagery.  sigh.  I love the series but really the only things to recommend this set are the generic statements that DVDs are better technology, and more convenient than tapes.  I hope Artisan does better with the second season.
B00005LLK8|4.0|This film breaks your heart, then fills it up again with the hope that young Billy Elliot can indeed make a better life for himself far from his British mining town.<br />Jamie Bell is an unrefined gem, raw and energetic in the title role, and this film's exploration of gender roles is handled with exquisite taste and sensitivity, gently mocking stereotypes but also offering touching examples of courage and grace from unexpected sources.<br />My only major criticism would be the film's epilogue.  Tacked on, perhaps, to give a sense of \\"closure\\" (complete with all-grown-up versions of several lead characters), this section felt wholly unnecessary, and definitely coloured my perception of the film as a whole.<br />But even the end wasn't enough to mar this film in my mind, ...  Definitely one worth adding to the collection...
B00005J6T0|5.0|This cd is definitialy the best Madonna album to date.  After a disappointing album &quot;Music&quot; which I am not waisting my time to review, this shows Madonnas true talent.  The song &quot;True Blue&quot; is a catchy and original song, the lyrics is average love song, but the music is funny.  I loved this as a little kid:)  although &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was the song that got me into her.  Anyway many people will notice that &quot;Live to tell&quot; show a deeper side of her, and was probably the first time she wrote deep lyrics.  I am not sure what Madonna mean with this song, but it is definitaly a great one, musicially its a ballad. (  &quot;Pappa dont preach&quot; is awesome too, it beginnns with beautiful violins combinied with pop.  Open you heart is another pop classic, wich isnt that great lyricially, but the music video is too funny,and the music is great too, but I feel that I have grown away from it.  One of the best Madonna songs ever is without a doubt &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; and now when I recentley begun liking latin music(mostly rock) its funny that this was the first latin song I begun to like.  The other songs are ok, but in this case I like the singles best.  I wish Madonna could go back to her old stuff.   It was in the 80s that Madonna really showed the world her talent(it begun with this cd.)
B000001GS3|5.0|Despite its unevenness of sophistication, in that it sometimes lurches back and forth between naive barrelthumping choruses (a la IL TROVATORE) and highly nuanced and thoughtful character studies (a la OTELLO), MACBETH may remain my alltime favorite Verdi opera, in that this change of tone is so perfectly suited to the material. Verdi was really trying something new here, and the excitement of his ability to set Shakespeare to music (and perhaps add a different dimension to it) shows throughout . Abbado's recording here is considered one of the best, and justly so: the conducting is very fine and crisp, and the production is genuinely exciting.<br />Just as all versions of the play rise and fall on their leads, so too do all versions of the opera depend on theirs, and there are few finer Macbeths and Lady macbeths than you'll find here. Shirley Verrett may have been one of the greatest of all Lady Macbeths, and she's spectacular here: she's not only terrifying in her Letter Aria but just as equally convincingly attractive (if sternly powerful) in the Brindisi. The sleepwalking scene is perhaps the finest aria Verdi ever wrote, and is in and of itself a miniature lesson in the power of what opera can do to extend pity and terror in drama (just listen to that chillingly accusative English horn rising at the end of each measure!), and here Verrett does not disappoint. Although many other of the best Lady Macbeths, such as Leonie Rysanek and Maria Callas, *act* the scene out more dramatically--gasping, for example, on the second syllable of the last &quot;immaginar&quot;--, Verrett achieves her effects in a different manner, almost entirely by her choice of dynamics. She may be more controlled, but every bit as memorable.
B00005JKES|1.0|Any DVD collection that touts itself as being &quot;The First Season: Special Edition&quot;  damn sure better have then entire first season included.  What studio moron agreed to release this without the pilot?  I mean, if I'm gonna shell out fifty bucks or more on something called &quot;special edition&quot;  I expect it to be special.  There is nothing special about this set at all.  I did better myself taping the Bravo repeats back in the early 90s.<br />The shows are great, this collection stinks.

0783240287|2.0|I was excited to finally find this title on DVD.  I'd seen the show live in Chicago years ago and loved it.  We've had the soundtrack on CD (fabulous) for years and it's one of my daughter's favorites.  Unfortunately, the video version of this production is significantly different than the live show and, in my opinion, the music is not nearly as good (as the show or the CD soundtrack).  Even more disturbing is the addition of several scenes that make this video inappropriate for small children.  I can't understand why these sexual innuendos were added, they certainly don't add anything to the story and as far as adult entertainment is concerned they're pretty lame. With just a little effort this could have been a great family video.
0060925000|3.0|Though it's quite a large book (the biggest single volume novel till now I believe) I for one have really enjoyed reading Seth's novel. It encompasses all traits necessary to keep the average reader's attention. The Stanford economist delivers all...a little comedy, drama, conflict, politics, suspense, and a unique array of characters. It's wonderful how he introduces and goes into detailed lives of all of them and makes them all have a purpose to the story in its entirety. Another big plus for the book is that it's easy to read because it's written in simple English; however, the general diction is a bit archaic. Overall: it was a very fun read.

B00003Q438|5.0|An excellent sci-fi movie that everybody should see.
3111199991|5.0|This video is like nothing I've ever seen before.  There are kids doing amazing tricks on scooters, including a backflip!!  There are also kids doing tricks on bikes and rollerblades as well. The video footage of the backflip is AWESOME!!  The music (soundtrack) is jamming and I loved the bear and rabbit scenes.  They were hilarious.  I highly recommend this video to EVERYONE, whether you like scooters or not, you'll be entertained!
0767803434|5.0|This is one of the best action packed movies I have ever watched. Should defenitely be in everyones movie collection. Plus Harrison Ford kicks butt in this movie!
0471413909|5.0|This plan really strikes me as the best possible way of eating.  I am familiar with a number of other popular &quot;low-carb&quot; plans, and most are either too high in saturated fat and too low in fruit and vegetables, or simply too complicated and full of unusual foods. This book describes what seems to be a very reasonable, tasty, and healthy eating plan based on lean meats, fruits and vegetables, and some healthy fats.  The author explains in simple terms how this is the diet that humans are genetically programmed to do best on. I'm convinced; I'm going to try it!
B00005RYKV|3.0|Since everyone else has already written about how they thought much of the film was formulaic, which it was, or how Kitano transcends the cliches, which he does, I'll just say that, despite some faltering performances by a few of the American actors, the film is very identifiable and enjoyable as a &quot;Kitano&quot; film.  What you should know is that the disc contains a &quot;cleaned-up&quot; version of the film in which many scenes containing violent content have been cropped or had gore digitally removed for U.S. release.  I don't believe it affects the running time much, but it is different from the Japanese release.  Also, if the subtitles (English or otherwise) are enabled, they run on all dialogue throughout the movie.  A selection were only the non-English dialogue is subtitled would have been appreciated.  I watch many subtitled films, but it felt distracting here.
0783235666|2.0|I have to say that I was distinctly unimpressed with this film.  Having read the book, I noticed that the tension and strangeness inherent in the situation did not come across strongly due to sleepy editing and the mere fact that the film dragged on for far too long.  Yes, the acting is decent, as is the script, but it could have been so much better.  It needed to be snappier, more abrupt, perhaps a little less subtle; haunting the viewer in a different way. Admittedly, it must have been hard to make, but I've seen better Hitchcock films.  Read the book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Two Thumbs up for this Breathtaking Kidman and Mcgregor filkm. Don't moan over the fact that its a musical, if you like Elton John, Madonna and Manroe, You'll love Red windmill(moulin rouge)!!! Nicole was lovely, and sang very well followed by a succesfully played role in THE OTHERS. You can watch this spellbinding, heartbreaking film and just melt. Place your bets on Moulin Rouge being up for atleast one oscar. Kidman plays the lovely Satine, head moulin rouge dancer, Diamond collector, who is set up to marry a duke by the hilarious Harry Zidler, and mistakes him for the penniless English writer. This is all made into a play. The only bad thing about this film is it is filmed so fast that you don't get to see the gorgeaus costumes they spent so much money on.    Anyway I highly recomend this movie!!!
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't have an educated ear for jazz, but I know what I like.  And this album cooks!  Simply wonderful, with one virtuoso handing-off-to or trading riffs  with another, the album is so loaded with genius it is stunning.<br />A great, classic seminal jazz album, I think it a good place to start if you, like me, are just beginning to get tuned up to the more modern incarnations of America's music.
0517122707|1.0|For years I have seen this text on recommended-reading lists.  I finally read it.  What are people thinking?  Because of the lack of any character with any redeeming characteristic, this turned into one long tedious reading of a book that starts nowhere and goes nowhere.  Due to the lack of any discernable plot, the protagonist of this text remains untransformed by any of the ludicrous slapstick that repeats endlessly like a needle stuck in a record groove.  With memorable lines like, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; repeated endlessly (closely followed by the equally side-splitting line, &quot;My valve!&quot;) you quickly realize that the author has no clue how to develop the main character into a person with whom a reader could identify.<br />If this isn't bad enough, the book also contains a shallow and mean-spirited depiction of gay sterotypes.  Women come off as stupid and whining nags.  In short, it is impossible for any intelligent person to sympathise with any of this book's characters.  Do not waste your time reading this overrated, fly-blown waste of paper.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Robert Duvall has said &quot;The English have their King Lear and Hamlet. Me?  I'd rather play Gus McCrae any day!&quot;<br />I agree with Mr. Duvall 100 percent.  Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae are classic American roles, and classic American characters.  As complex and well-written as anything I can think of.  And it was our great fortune that two of our best American actors, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall, were cast to play these two characters.  They are simply indelible.<br />Woodrow Call, a small man whose ramrod straight bearing and will of iron and ferocious temper makes everyone THINK he is a big man. Stubborn, terse, subtley ironic, a natural leader, with a fierce guard on his emotions. Gus McCrae, lazy, laconic, romantic, with a constant twinkle in his eye and a joke on his lips,  tough &amp; tender with his heart on his sleeve.  These two are the kind of opposites that make truly great and lasting friendships.<br />These two old retired Texas Rangers decide to take a herd of cattle to the wild and unknown Montana country just for the-hell-of-it, and in this journey much adventure, tragedy and surprises occur that allow us to get to know these two men and their fellow travelers in ways unexpected and profound.<br />A wonderful story, brought to the screen with love &amp; care, resulting in an unforgettable experience. Full of McMurtry's great touches:  murderous &amp; pitiless villains, fierce and merciless hostile Indians, odd &amp; touching characters, women with depth &amp; guts &amp; heart, and  an impossible trek full of surprises and the sudden death so possible in a hard and wild country.<br />The entire cast is first-rate, with Diane Lane a Lorena anyone would fall in love with, Frederic Forest a renegade to scare the pants off anyone, young Rick Shroeder as Call's unacknowledged son, Robert Urich as their neer-do-well Ranger friend, Jake, and Danny Glover, Angelica Huston, and the actor who plays Peaeye (sorry for not remembering his name), ChrisCooper and many many more. Cast with loving care. <br />I dunno, if you don't like Lonesome Dove what's to be done with you? This is a classic American tale, well told, and full of odd &amp; complex characters with great dialogue and plenty of adventure.  Brought to the screen with care &amp; love.  Works for me!<br />If you like Lonesome Dove, you will probably like the Prequel: Dead Man's Walk, and the Sequel: Streets of Laredo.  May take a bit to adjust to the cast changes, but the roles are cast with care, and the writing is McMurtry's and the stories corkers! If you don't like Lonesome Dove, well, too bad for you.
B00003CXZ3|2.0|I watched this movie based on recommendations, and i hated it.  It was supposed to be about someone who cannot make new memories, but nothing in the film really seemed to be about that.  it was more just a repetitive series of flashbacks, each of which disclosed another bit of a dumb story.  don't bother
B00005R87Q|2.0|WOW, THERE IS SOME REALLY BAD ACTING IN THIS MOVIE. NOT TO MENTION THE PLOT. SUBSTITUTE SURFING FOR STREET RACING AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE?--- POINT BREAK! THIS MOVIE WAS ALSO VERY UNREALISTIC, AND THE CARS WHERE NOT EXOTIC AT ALL. IF YOU LIKE CARS, GONE IN 60 SECONDS IS A BETTER CAR MOVIE. BUT IT DID MAKE GET IN MY CAR AND DRIVE VERY FAST. THAT'S WHY IT GETS TWO STARS INSTEAD OF 1. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!
B00005Q66T|3.0|This chronicle of the Material Girl's second decade falls short of IMMACULATE COLLECTION, her greatest 80's hits package---mainly because Madonna hasn't (musically speaking) lit up the last decade of the last century like she did the Reagan Era. By far the best tracks here were for the most part culled from her latest couple of albums, RAY OF LIGHT and MUSIC----including the title tracks from the aforementioned LP's, the Jan Hammer-like &quot;Power Of Good-Bye,&quot; &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl,&quot; the  neo-psychedelic &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; (from the second Austin Powers flick), and &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;(whose beginning still fakes me out).
6300271439|5.0|This movie is great esecially if you like Madonna.  It would make a great gift for a Madonna lover.  I doubt that they have this one.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|Dire Straits first album is considered by a section of fans as the best album the group has ever produced. However I don't agree to that opinion. It has some gems like my favourite &quot;Sultans of swing&quot;, country tinged &quot;Water of love&quot; and blues rocker &quot;Six blade Knife&quot; which comes with extra ordinary sound created by MK's guitar.<BR>Lets spend some time discussing MK's guitar playing in 'SOS', but really can we really discuss? It's something nobody can describe. Yes, he plays with bare fingers ... so much control he has over the strings of that instrument called 'guitar'!!! Sometimes I really can't believe that playing guitar is so easy, you can do whatever you like? I know all the notes played in that song by heart. Who has listen, knows it is hard to beat.<BR>If you want my opinion he is one of the best two guitarists in the world. Other being Eddie van Halen.<BR>But judging the overall content, I would say it is somewhat weeker to 'Making movies', 'Love over gold', 'Brothers in arms' and even 'On every street'. It sounds a bit similar to 'Communique'. Still if you are thinking of buying it, go ahead. Buy it for Sultans of swing. I will give 4 stars to it, so it's not bad at all.
0385505833|5.0|This is a very delightful story....and makes for very funny reading, especially at the Christmas Holidays! I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00000099Y|5.0|It is obvious that Aenima is a bar-none accomplishment of sort, which was created so that the ear would explore lush and vast territorial depths that many cannot complete. Maynard and the boys have really worked themselves to accomplish an achievement like this. I do not think that anybody else in all of musics past has ever created such a diabolical song structure as Tool have proved they are capable of doing on Aenima. Pink Floyd could have possibly came close, but for this generation and for yours trulies ears, Tool is the band who has done so. Tool is without a doubt the mother who provides the breast milk in todays rock scene. You see beyond infinity bands who try desperately to imitate Tools capabilities but any one who has a brain in their skull, knows that they fail. Now if you havent heard a song off Aenima, prepare for a mind altering experiance. Tools music had references to the end of the world, Christs death, selling out, and much more themes one must have an open mind upon listening to. If you object Tool, please go back to your Jars of Clay music and leave real music alone please. tool is the band of the 90s decade, in my opinion. And if they continue to go in the direction they did with Lateralus, then we are in for a big treat in the following years to come.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|When I bought this album and heard all the songs I was so moved. Songs like Escape, Don't turns off the lights,Hero, and I will survive make you want to dance. Enrique is a true talented person. His music is one of a kind. No other male artist right now does not even come close to his talent. Enrique is a original in everything he does. This album is his best so far and a musical treat. His best songs are also in spanish which all <BR>latin people can listen to the power of the spanish language.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I think this must've been the strategy behind the making of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;: some girls wanted to take their boyfriends to a chick-flick-in-disguise. They added a battle scene or two, and voila! &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was born. I got to see this movie first as extra credit for a humanities class; the teacher shouldn't have bothered, because &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; had very little to do with actual history. Most of the movie was bogged down in a sappy, overused love triangle, not to mention the improbability of a downed pilot coming back from the dead. Then, at the end, the Doolittle raid convieniently removed one of the men from the scene. Strange how perfectly things worked out for the other guy... Cliched lines and a syrupy plot make this one to avoid for all but diehard fans of the bushy-eyebrowed Hartnett and cleft-chinned Affleck.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|1.)  Sean Connery's back in the role to which most people best associate him (would \\"Trainspotting\\" REALLY have been as good without the dialogue between Renton and Sick Boy in the park during the air rifle scene?)<br />><br />2.)  Film and special effects technology finally had finally caught up with the series by the time this movie was made.  As cool as Sean Connery was back in the shagadelic '60's, baby, the special effects in his movies were really second-rate.  They may have been a step up from the Godzilla movies of the era, but not by much.  The action in this movie seems to take place in real time rather than in a special effets lab.<br />><br />3.)  The supporting cast are awesome...former Blaxploitation superstar Bernie Casey may be the best CIA Operative Felix Leiter there's ever been; Rowan Atkinson (\\"Mr. Bean\\", to most of us Americans) is good as the hopelessly up-tight Nigel Small-Fawcett, and does anyone really need to be told just how hot Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are as a \\"Bond Girl\\" double-barrelled blast?<br />><br />4.)  THE PRICE!!!  With all the other MGM/UA Bond films weighing in at [price](or more), only Ted Turner himself can afford to own them.  This admitted re-make of \\"Thunderball\\" is not the best Bond movie out there...IMHO that distinction goes to \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" (sue me, I'm a hockey fan and I grew up during the Roger Moore years)...but for the price alone this is worth owning.  True, the classic \\"James Bond Theme\\" is missing, and it is a bit tacky seeing the jet-setters in tuxedoes and evening gowns playing \\"Centipede\\" instead of baccarrat (sp?), but this DVD is the James Bond film anyone can own...and regardless of what shortcomings other reviewers have attributed this effort, none of them fall on Sean Connery's (ample-as-ever) shoulders; give it a shot (with a Walther PPK or a union jack fountain pen)!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Without listening to those who claimed it to be a &quot;girls movie&quot;, my husband and I went together to the movie theater to watch it. And we both loved it!<br />Aside from being very funny, it also has a deep meaning to it. Never judge from the appearance only, things are not always what they look, actually they RARELY are what they look. And this is what Elle Woods, the main character, wants to prove. Greatly interpreted by Reese Witherspoon, Elle looks and behaves like a girl straight out of a blond joke. She sees silly and shallow at first (but extremely funny!), but then you change your mind quickly when you see how she reacts to her boyfriend dumping her because she doesn't fit into his plan of becoming senator, she's too pretty, too perfect, wears too much pink, and she's too... blond. You start really liking Elle when she gets admitted to Harvard, and start being a real fan of hers when she shows how she can gain respect for being smart and a good student even when still wearing flashy designer clothes.<br />This movie shows you that a woman has many resources and that being good-looking and caring about one's appearance doesn't mean one doesn't care about anything else. It will make you laugh, but it will also make you think. And you'll probably want to watch it again!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Oh my God!  This album is totally OFF DA HOOK!  The musicianship iz tight, the funk iz even funkier, and the melodies and ballads R simply beautiful.  But, that's what U get when U buy a PRINCE album.  Not only do U get the bump and grind, love-making grooves, and soaring rock - U also get thought-provoking lyrix & a concept that'll actually take a rocket scientist 2 understand unless U open your mind.  2 those who R expecting the pop-likeness of LET'S GO CRAZY or 1999 4 that matter, let me hip U 2 this:  Prince admitted that THE RAINBOW CHILDREN iz not nor was it meant 2 B a pop album.  I guess those who R satisfied with the album either had open minds or hav read the royal 1's purpose 4 this album.  WHAT U PUT IN2 IT IZ WHAT U GET OUT OF IT!  I simply enjoyed the album and got what I expected, wanted, and needed - great musicianship, great songwriting, and enlightenment.  Johnny B. iz doin' his thang on 'dem drums.  Larry Graham iz truly workin' that bottom-end on THE WORK Pt. 1 (I play this track on my job & often 4get where I am).  THE LAST DECEMBER iz truly remarkable.  Just read the lyrix 2 the song as Prince insert meaningful thoughts in2 your head.  THE EVERLASTING NOW takes me back 2 the medley he and Larry did on the RAVE Un2 the Year 2000 concert.  At times, I almost break my neck when listening 2 the over-powering funk on that track.  MUSE 2 THE PHARAOH might have D'angelo wishing he could've written that 1.  Sorry D., the teacher has taken the torch back from U (it was Prince's in the 1st place - he just had D. 2 hold it 4 him 4 awhile).  SHE LOVES ME 4 ME - this track had my god-sister (who technically doesn't listen 2 Prince now that she's saved) asking me 2 dub her a copy of that track.  U can't tell me that PRINCE has lost it.  He's still got it and gained a lot more.  Ahem!  MELLOW - oh my God.  Has Miles risen from the dead or did Prince channel his spirit when composing this track?  It's totally off da hook.  Najee's flute skills R definitely depicted on this 1.  Common and Macy Gray R mentioned as performers N his videotaped mellow after party.  ...  1+1+1=3 may cause me 2 bust my speakers 1 day.  This tune iz 2 funky 2 play at low decibals.  Where 'dem banished 1's at?  We don't cut 'em no slack.  Think about it.  <br />2 all the naysayers who insist on comparing this wonderful album 2 his 80's hey-day, it seems that where Prince is trying 2 take his listeners iz unimportant 2 U.  Thus, it may seem that U might get off the bus B4 it arrives at it's final destination:  A MUSICAL PARADISE.  But, that's cool.  Remain N the digital garden all U want.  We, The Rainbow Children, will B enlightened and freed.  Plus, we'll still B partying beyond 1999, 2000, 2001, etc.  Basically, eternity (if it's within GOD'S will).<br />The Rainbow Children R rising and will continue 2 rise!<BR>Peace and chicken grease.<br />WCB
B00005R2M3|4.0|This is a heck of a debut English CD for Spanish-language sensation Shakira. A sparkplug of a performer, Shakira has some electrifying tracks here. You've already heard &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; -- the most pop-sensitive single, also sung in Spanish. But there are lots of other little gems here, too.<br />The first four songs alone are IMHO, sure-fire hits -- <BR>1. Objection (Tango)<BR>2. Underneath Your Clothes<BR>3. Whenever, Wherever<BR>4. Rules<BR> <BR>Shakira shows the most guts when she pokes fun at her small breasts, on more than one track. She isn't the world's best singer, but her voice is pleasant enough, and her spirit shines through.<br />Enjoy!
B00005QDW1|5.0|NO DOUBT's roots are in SKA.  SKA is a fusion of Jamaican  rhythm with R&amp;B.  SKA originated in Jamaica and what NO DOUBT appears to be doing with this album is exploring the origins of SKA.  <BR>     Some people might classify this as NO DOUBT selling out but if you look a little bit closer NO DOUBT is actually just broadening their musical minds while paying homage to their true roots.  <BR>     This album IS a different sound for them. It maybe a tad upbeat and catchy for some of you BEACON STREET COLLECTION lovers but it's still the same NO DOUBT (with just a different outlook on life).<BR>     I recommend this album and applaud NO DOUBT for never sticking to the mainstream.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Level 42, Crowded House.... if you loved them and listened to their albums over and over until it hurt to stop.... then this is a MUST for your collection. This CD has played non-stop for the past 4 weeks and I am not sick of it yet. I have it on at work and it is joyful, relaxing and energenic.. and then when you read the words - poetry - feelings that I have felt in the past but was unable to put into words as eloquently as he has.<br />Trust me..... you won't be sorry. :)
B000002OX7|5.0|From the ashes of a failed science fiction project (Lifehouse) comes the Who's best collection of songs. Each song is a classic in its own right. The songs on Who's Next tell tales of love, loss, anger and redemption, each supported by excellent melodies, a totally focused sound and some of Daltrey's most expressive vocals. Listen to the narrator of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" carefully. While the lyrics point to a character filled with rage, Daltrey's voice makes you listen intently to a person whose intensity is frightening with something akin to sympathy. Each song tells its own story succinctly and with passion and power. Townshend begins his fascination with synthesizers on this album; they work well here, adding texture to the overall sound without becoming intrusive as they do on later CD's. (Particularly on Who Are You) Is this a perfect CD? Well, it just might be the perfect Who CD, containing all the musical sophistication and lyrical challenges that the listener has come to expect from this band, but rarely receives for a whole CD. (This review refers to the original recording not the remastered CD)
6305558167|5.0|If you do not enjoy a &quot;story&quot;, then this movie is not for you.  Do not expect a &quot;slice 'em and dice 'em&quot; action packed &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; movie.  This is not it.  This is a wonderful story of a mythical past.  Remember, this movie was made over 20 years ago and the special effects and acting reflect that.  There are no eye sizzling computer animated creatures or scenes.  However, if you get into the story of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Excalibur &amp; the Knights of the Round Table; you will enjoy this film.  I give this movie five stars because I love the legend.
0440234743|4.0|<BR>The Good:<br />Good character development with regard to &quot;Nate&quot;, the protagonist, who deals with his own demons while simultaneously having to trudge through the wilds of South America. The story moves quickly and keeps you reading and Grisham does a great job of describing the Pantanal region of South America and working it into the story.<br />The Bad:<br />There are too many poorly developed minor characters (exwives, kids, lawyers, etc.) to care about or keep track of and it tends to make things a little confusing. <br />The Ugly:<br />The book centers around an epic legal battle in the making that ultimately ends in a quick, uninteresting and unsatisfying whimper.  I can think of 10 endings to this particular plot line that would have been better.<br />Overall:<br />This is the first Grisham book I've read and it's worth reading for the story, but don't expect a big climactic finish or you'll be disappointed.<BR>
B00005JKHP|1.0|I have watched star trek all my life. And this was the worst remake of star trek i had ever seen.  I am becoming an editer, and after watching this, if they are popping out people like this out of USC and UCLA, i am going to have no problem getting a job.  The problem was this.  In the movie there are changes, witch it is ok to change things.  But the edits they change and the places where they cut look horrible.  Also the orginal one also provided mystery to Vger.  In this they just about give the whole thing away, with the new cgi shots that look horrible.  And after listening to the documtary on the second cd called redirecting the future, it sounds like the cgi people hijacked the movie from robert wise and tryed to make it what they wanted to.  The only thing i liked about it was the two other documentaries and that was about all.  And one other <BR>comment. I feel sorry for the cgi people and the other people who worked on the remake, because they could of learned a lot from Robert Wise.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I'm a mid forties boomer with a PhD in the sciences and drive an M3. So to all of those boomers below that say this is for teens only..........too bad, this is a great movie.  It's got lots of action and a mindless plot that really lets you get away from it all.  But please, all of you Civic drivers and other rice burners, you don't stand a chance against an M!!!! Quit trying!!
B00005ATQI|5.0|Let's get one thing straight, the Kubrick film is not, repeat, is not the book. It is a re-invention of the theme under the same title. That being said, let's cut the whining about how different it is from the book and try to judge the film on its own merits.<br />The movie held my attention from start to finish, and geuniunely scared me at parts. Much has been made of the characters, so let's review them. First, there is Jack, a man who was apparently never very stable and, once placed in relative isolation in a haunted hotel, goes completely crazy. This is consistent with the character's history as explained in the film. His &quot;recovery&quot; after breaking his son's arm was apparently only a thin shell that he developed to hide his abberation. As a side note, this is consistent with the Jack in the book, who never sought outside help to help him control his drinking (unlike the miniseries, the first 20 minutes or so of which seemed like Jack doing a commercial for AA). In this film (and in the book) Jack's erratic nature was invisible to his family because they loved him blindly. Shelly Duval's character appears to be just the kind of person who could love a person so blindly, so she gets five stars too.<br />Danny's performance in the movie is also widely criticized as over the top, especially with regards to the &quot;redrum&quot; sequence. Let's not forget, however, that he is a child and something unworldly is happening to him. What do you expect, calm acceptance of his situation? I doubt that even an adult could manage that in his situation. Furthermore, the Tony in the film was largely unseen, like the Tony in the book, which enhanced the effect of &quot;his&quot; role greatly. This is in contrast to the Tony of the miniseries, who hovered above Danny and preached like some cheesy b-movie angel.<br />A lot is made about the elements of the book that were excluded. The things that were lost, however, really made little difference to the plot. The hornet'snest sequence served only to highlight Jack's inadequacy as an exterminator  The topiaries were not missed as they were probably the silliest part of the book (when I read that part remember thinking &quot;what is this, 'Day of the Triffids' all of a sudden?&quot;). The hedge maze was a place of fun turned into a trap that required paradoxial thinking (i.e. walking backwards) to foil. This was consistent with the tone of the movie and enhanced it greatly.<br />Again., I urge viewers to watch this movie with an open mind. Don't criticize it just because it is different from the book. Instead, try to appreciate the creepy atmosphere, shockig visuals and excellent performances.
B00005QDW1|4.0|This band knows how to, as Pink might cheer, &quot;get the party started&quot;!  Gwen has never sounded more carefree and sure of herself.  The rest of the band has fun with the music and thus make a very satisfying record.  &quot;Hella Good&quot; is by far my favorite...right now.  &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is a great alternative to all the other songs currently being played on the radio!
B000000WA4|5.0|For all of their previous accomplishments, nothing could have prepared the world for what the Chicago-based Smashing Pumpkins would bring to the table with their double-album/masterpiece, \\"Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness.\\" Co-produced by Flood (Nine Inch Nails), the set -- which marks the third effort the band -- is as lush as it is intimate, as ambitious as it is focused and every bit as grand as such an affair should be.<br /><br />From the opening swells of the hit \\"Tonight, Tonight,\\" the amount of growth marked between this and the band's previous effort, \\"Siamese Dream\\" is evident. A sweeping ballad that is unlike anything the band had poduced before, it's not only indicative of the what was to come, but also merely a sampler of the wide variety of sounds the album has to offer. From there we are treated to the retro-pop of \\"1979,\\" a nostalgic anthem of sorts that finds the band working with a drum machine for the first time since recruiting drumming powerhouse Jimmy Chamberlin. Bassist D'arcy Wretzky dominates on heavier fare such as \\"Zero\\" (a signature song of the band) and the superior \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth,\\" which threatens to overload and obliterate even the best sound system. It's not all sonic bombast, though, as some of the simpler tracks like \\"Muzzle\\" (which carries the trademark vintage Pumpkins sound) and \\"Thirty-Three\\" are the stars that burn the brightest.<br /><br />From front to back, not a moment on \\"Mellon Collie\\" is wasted. Not only is the band in top form and firing on all cylinders (arguably for the first and last time in their career) but Corgan's songwriting hits an all-time high as well. Unlike many of their fellow rockers, Smashing Pumpkins weren't afraid to embrace accessibility and reach new heights creatively, and to that end, \\"Mellon Collie & The Inifinite Sadness\\" is one of the most competent and most compelling rock releases of the 90's. A true classic that no collection -- alternative or otherwise -- should go without.
B00003XACV|5.0|Did you ever have a cd that you listened to while you wrote because it changed the way you wrote? this does it for me. <br />The music flows from one track to the next and somehow makes you smarter and more introspective. I can't tell if it's because it reminds me of the movie, or if it's the music standing on its own, but the music makes me work harder on whatever it is I'm doing. It's also the most beautiful musical score since &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;. *Advice: Don't confuse musical score with soundtrack-totally different CD's and this is the musical score. Soundtrack has Annie Lennox, etc. This one is for mood.
B00005O5JV|4.0|I rented this movie expecting highly entertaining, enjoyable fluff.<br />This movie was all that -- but also so much more. Legally Blonde is one of the most subversive mainstream movies I've seen in a long time. I would go so far as to call it a daring stab in the back to to the feminist backlash in its assertion that independent, empowered women come in all shapes, sizes and haircolors. <br />This film, on the surface, appears to feed into our culture's stereotypes of women. We pigeonhole and define women by their appearances, and judge them through harsh dichotomies -- virgin/whore, beautiful and stupid/ugly and brainy. Such categorizations help prevent women from uniting and overthrowing the patriarchal establishment. <br />Witherspoon's Elle must work hard to overcome the preconceptions that come w/ her background, appearance and experience, but she eventually succeeds in asserting her intelligence, her independence and her determination to a doubtful student body. The judgement she initially receives from her more traditionally &quot;feminist&quot;-ish fellow law students eventually turns to respect and friendship. Women unite themselves across societally-imposed boundaries, and the result is energizing, encouraging and entertaining.<br />Legally Blonde is comedy at its best -- a substantive message well disguised in the form of light-hearted entertainment.
0671799320|5.0|A lot of what happens in the world today is because of oil. the need for it, the need to sell it, or the need to keep it out of the hands of your enemy. This book looks at history from that perspective from 1800's to the Gulf War. <br />But that isn't why I rated this book a 5 and that isn't why I used this book as the inspiration for my senior thesis in college. This book has enough information in here to teach an oil executive more about his field, and it tells the story on a level that the average curious mind could digest it all. <br />Why I love this book? Because this is the book you give to a cousin or a friend who always had the ability to learn a lot about the world but never did because he doesn't see how it is relevant to his life. This book is the one that wakes someone up. If you can get past the formidable size, you get to a great great story. A great story that, as I said to an 11-year old who I actually sucked into the stories in this book, &quot;a great story and it actually happened - it's a true story!&quot;<br />That's the most amazing part of this book. Yergin can take credit for writing the authoritative account of an amazing story with gainful insight into the way the modern world now operates.
0930289528|5.0|In the early 1990's, Earth has fallen to a terrible nuclear war.  The oceans have engulfed many areas, such as Australia, while other areas have barely managed to survive.  In the aftermath of the war, Britain fell into utter chaos.  In the chaos came the strong arm of the fascist, who marched in with no resistance. The year is 1997, and the fascist has a government in place, and has ruled with an iron fist.  There is no political freedom, there is no personal freedom, and there is no hope.<br />This is the setting for V for Vendetta, a tale written by Alan Moore, also known for his Watchmen series.  The story begins with a young woman named Evey Hammond, who accidentally solicits an undercover cop.  By law, the cop and his friends can do whatever they want to her.  Before that can happen, and man in a cloak and mask appears to save the day.  He calls himself &quot;V&quot;.  He kills one man with an exploding hand, fires tear gas at the others, then takes Evey to the rooftop where he blows up Big Ben and launches a display of fireworks (something that no one has seen since before the war).<br />That's just in the first few pages of this book!  The rest of the story revolves around our mysterious hero, who only calls himself V, and how he slowly dismantles his enemies and oppressive government, all while educating the naive Evey.<br />This book is a fantastic commentary on socialism and human nature.  It depicts a very dark world where fascism is taken to the extreme.  Our hero, &quot;V&quot;, is the complete opposite of all this.  He (or she) wears a mask and pounces around London as if it is his own.  He comes and goes as he pleases and quotes Shakespeare as if he had written the lyrics himself.  He is violent. So much so that this book is not for the squeamish or the young.  Parental Discretion is advised.<br />With the many small plots and overall commentary of the world, this deep book certainly is not for everyone.  The hero (or anti-hero), is not your typicalcomic-book, spandex-wearing do-gooder.  The story reads like a play, where players come and go, and &quot;V&quot; is the star.  The story focuses on Britain, and how one person can change everything.  It is a very interesting tale of Good and Evil, and how the lines are all blurred in-between.  I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for good story that may just make you change your view on life.<br />\\"All the world's a stage.  Everything else is Vaudeville!\\" -- V
B00005KFUM|5.0|Before this album I was not a fan of Muse at all.  I just thought of them as yet another Radiohead cash-in band.  So upon heavy recommendation I decided to order this album.  Hell if I didn't like it, I wouldn't have that hard of a time selling it.  <br />The vocals are better, a lot more range to them than what was showed in Showbiz.  The albums opener, New Born, is one amazing piece of music.  Bliss is just as good, and the epic Space Dementia is too.  The album continues along this pace with only one song I don't really like.  That being Screenager.  All in all I'd say it's around the top 10 albums released last year.
B00005QIPH|5.0|all i can say is, i hope they become rich &amp; famous.  they deserve it.  lathough this really isn't anyhting new (sounds like late 80's/early 90's stuff), it's still really good.  also, they have a sense of humor.  anyway, this is the best albumn i've bought in a very long time.
B00003CXXP|5.0|A. I.--Artificial Intelligence is the best movie I have ever seen.  In it Osment--as a robot boy--is symbolic of children who are &quot;different&quot;.  Whether they have physical, mental, or educational problems, they do not meet parental expectations.  David (played by Osment) is an unconditionally loving, innocent child, but is unable to be what his parents want (in this case, human).  The moral of the story is, though people dream of loving, empathetic children, when some are blessed with them, not only do they not appreciate it, they do not recognize it.
0140186409|5.0|As a reader, I move pretty quick.  I tend to devour books in weekends, or in some cases, overnight.  It took me over two months to read Grapes of Wrath.  And it was well worth the time invested.  I can liken reading it to drinking a fine wine.  You don't gulp, but savor.  Enjoy.  Relax.<br />Steinbeck nailed it.  He captured the flavor, feeling, behaviors, attitudes, societal woes, and speech of that era.  The prose was beautiful, and the ending was extremely profound on so many different levels.  A great novel will educate the reader in some way, or at least challenge their thinking about the world around them.  This book did just that.  I've heard the term &quot;Okies&quot; used a slur several times during my childhood, but never understood where it originated.  Now, I do.  Whenever I hear that term again, I will have an image ingrained in my mind of Americans, our brothers and sisters, searching for not just a new way of life, but FOR survival. I won't soon forget this novel.
B00005R2IS|4.0|I saw &quot;Mad Max&quot; almost a decade ago on local TV, and despite being edited for television, it was a shocking and intense movie.  Besides the simple plot, this film manages to work just as well as when I first saw it.  The violence is this film is rather tame, often cutting away to show something that may be not as gory, but is just as shocking.  The chases in this film are incredible (and the more surprising since this was made before the advent of CGI).  The new DVD release has some rather interesting treats, such as the original Australian audio, as opposed to the dubbed version that floats around on television (the fact there doesn't seem to be a problem with understanding the dialogue in the original track makes me wonder why it hasn't been released like this in the U.S. for so long), plus you can pick between seeing the film in Widescreen or Pan&amp;Scan (widescreen...no contest on how I watch it), a documentary on the film's influence, and a commentary by members of the crew (who explain some of the more startling sequences in the movie).  For the price, &quot;Mad Max&quot; is definitely worth checking out.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I checked this out from my library and have renewed it twice.  I could watch it over and over.  Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke's portrayals of Mr. Rochester and Jane were right on target.  Prior to watching this movie, I had only seen Timothy Dalton as James Bond.  Since I'm not a Bond fan, I didn't get much out of it.  Now that I've seen him as Mr. Rochester, I'm on a quest to see him in everything else that's available on video.  He was wonderful in Wuthering Heights as well but I was disappointed with the way it was scripted.
B00005JKES|5.0|- because Artisan doesn't have the rights to it.  Warner Brothers has exclusive rights to the pilot episode, so Artisan could NOT include it in this DVD release without their permission.  Which, alas, they don't want to give.  If yuo want to see the pilot released on DVD, then write to Warner.  There's no point bitching about it not neing included in this set, because there was quite literally NOTHING Artisan could do about it.  Be glad we're getting it AT ALL, given how long it's been since this series was originally released on VHS and Laserdisc.<br />One of the previous reviewers raised a valid point, though.  The pilot is quite readily available in other formats on ebay, or just about any decent used video outlet.  At least we can look forward to getting the rest of the series on DVD, then maybe Warner will wise up and release a Special Edition of the pilot (ie: with BOTH endings - the original T.V. ending, and the European theatrial ending).  So stop comp,aining about it not being in this set, because it's not Artisan's fault.
0140177396|5.0|Between the haunting characterization and the brilliant story-telling, Steinbeck created a novella that captures the human experience with an eerie certainty. Like Hemingway, the few words used create more power than other authors who can be sometimes accused of over-stating their point.

B000000W5L|4.0|This is pretty murky sounding Stones album, but it contains some incredible songs.  The vocals, typically sung in unison between Mick &amp; others, seem as if they were recorded about 6-7 feet away from the microphones.  I can only imagine how good this album would be if in fact that were different.  That being said, this album does contain some of the best rock n roll tunes ever played or written in Tumblin Dice &amp; Happy, while Torn &amp; Freyed is as good a country song as was created in the 70s.  Overall, the album grows on you, but don't expect the Stones sound you are familiar with.  I would definitely recommend Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers over this one, but Exile is well worth it after you have collected those.
B000002GF8|5.0|Why is it that the best, most sophisticated of rock bands last for so little time? The Beatles, Cream, Genesis (the original Genesis with Peter Gabriel), Dire Straits and the Police to name a few. Those names, though, except for Dire Straits, have something more in common: They are multi-talented bands. It seems that bands that have only one member who is creatively and musically dominant seem to last much longer, maybe because the other members know quite well that they won't make it on their own. Bands like the Beatles or Cream tend to fall victim to the bandmates' egos and to power-struggles. So it happenned that, like with the Beatles, the more sophisticated the Police's music became, the worse their internal relationship was, until finally they disbanded after this, their best and only fifth album.<br />Though the Police's music is usually labeled as 'pop', it never was. Pop usually means mainstream, a definition which fits Sting's solo music (as good and sophisticated as it is), but never the Police, who were by far more sophisticated and original than most anything pop music produced in the early eighties. Their first albums were characterized with a style that was somehow blended from funk, punk and raggae, which was entirely origianl by itself; but in their last two releases they abandoned their trademark style and went off to explore any number of other influences, from latin (Miss Grandeko), fasr-eastern (Mother) and african music (Walking In Your Footsteps) to new wave synth pop (Synchronicity) to swing (Murder By Numbers). Mostly due to the frictions within the band, this album is much less 'Police' and much more Sting, Andy Summers and Stuart Copeland than anything else they've done. Andy's jazz persona surfaces for the first time (his influence on 'Murder By Numbers' is especially clear); and though all three players retained their very unique styles, they now use them in a wider variety of contextes, making a richer, more interesting music.<br />Synchronicity has a very dark atmosphere, a sort of a manic-depressive sarcasm that lasts through most of the songs, especially Sting's compositions, songs like 'Murder By Numbers', 'Walking In Your Footsteps', 'Wrapped Around Your Finger' and - yes, 'Every Breath You Take', though the tune is so drilled into our heads as a love song that we don't give much thought to the lyrics any more (I can't believe they actually play this song in weddings!) There is only one straight love song on the album - 'Tea In The Sahara', and not surprisingly it's the weakest song on the album, even though it's also quite beautiful. Stuart's one entry on the album, 'Miss Grandeko', fails to break the tense, creepy feeling of the whole thing. And it's that feeling, more than anything, that makes this album anything but pop. Most of all, my favorite song, 'Murder By Numbers', a swing track with lyrics by Sting and music by Andy, which brings out the best in all members. A perfect ending to the album.<br />Just a few words about Andy's song, 'Mother': it's really not that bad. It's just not what you would expect to find on this album. Is that a bad thing? True, it's not a pop song. True, it's delivered by Andy's screamy semi-singing voice instead of Sting's beautiful, immediately recognizable voice. It doesn't sound like the Police. But it's a stroke of genius by its own right. I'm not surprised Police fanatics hate it, but pay no heed to them: do not skip this track. Listen to it at least once.<br />Everybody has one Police greatest hits compilation or another, because the Police are best known as a hit-making pop group; but they're so much more. Get at least one Police album, and start either with Synchronicity or Ghost In The Machine.
B00003CXXP|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for A.I., I was very excited about the film. Watching it for the first time was an incredible moment. This is a very visual stunning film with every emotion. It has love, hate, anger, sadness, happiness, etc...<BR>Haley Joel Osment gives an Oscar performance, as well as Jude Law as Gigilo Joe. Teddy also gives off a great performance as a &quot;supertoy.&quot; <BR>I waited and waited for the A.I. dvd to be released, and I still have to wait a few more months for this great film to be playing in my dvd player. <BR>I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to go on a visual ride with a incredible sad, but happy story.
B00005Q45W|4.0|&quot;Ten New Songs&quot; demonstrates that times have indeed changed since Cohen's legendary 1967 debut. Gone are the sensuous landscapes of sorrow that characterized Cohen's folk days. Since 1984's splendid &quot;Various Positions,&quot; Cohen's gradual retreat from spare but stirring instrumentation towards wailing synthesizers, lush background vocals, and torpid drum beats, became stubbornly solidified. There is no looking back for Leonard Cohen. Those days are long gone, ensuring that those early gems--Songs, Songs of Love and Hate, and Songs From A Room--endure as relics of the days when contemporary artists knew how to capture sorrow in song.<br />But now, the year 2002 just born, time's tatters mark Cohen's voice like ink on a white, linen shirt. Even the days of 1988's  brilliant &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; are irretrievable, as Cohen's robust baritone is now just a memory haunting his new, ragged croon. When Leonard Cohen is found turning knobs on soundboards and singing &quot;like a vacuum bag with a smoking problem,&quot; as my friend Justin once put it, it becomes rather apparent that Cohen's generation is that bottle wine, aged over a period of decades, that just won't turn sour. You pop open the cork and your nose dances with the the fermenting odors of time.<br />There are such moments here, on Cohen's &quot;Ten New Songs.&quot; &quot;Then I came back from where I'd been/My room, it looked the same/But there was nothing left between/The nameless and the name,&quot; Cohen sings. He is indeed back in fine form, but the rifts between now and then occasionally slow the album's momentum and conjure memories of what once was.<br />The old joke is that Cohen's albums come with razor blades, but &quot;Ten New Songs&quot;--in music, at least--reveals an unusually balanced soul. This is not to underplay Cohen's trademark morbidity and cynicism, for most of the lyrics are dour as ever, but perhaps Cohen's knack for matching his music to the pathos of his words is waning. That is not necessarily a bad thing, however. As on Bob Dylan's new &quot;Love and Theft,&quot; the apparent irony created between tender music and unrelenting, confessional language is frequently dazzling.<br />The blissful arrangements of &quot;In My Secret Life,&quot; truly one of the best songs of Cohen's career, fades into the kind of authentically moving sorrow and wonder that the music industry offers so rarely these days. Listeners will feel their hearts folding in on themselves like paper fans as Cohen courses gracefully through the fragile soundscapes and concessions of such ethereally tender ballads as &quot;That Don't Make it Junk,&quot; &quot;Love Itself,&quot; and &quot;You have Loved Enough.&quot; While the album as a whole has a flavor distinct from its predecessors, Cohen revisits the haunting terrain of such past masterpieces as &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; or &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; on the harrowing &quot;By The Rivers Dark,&quot; whose seductive cadence makes it easily one of the album's best songs.<br />Many critics note that this is Cohen's quietest collection. Indeed, some of the tracks, like songs on his last effort, &quot;The Future,&quot; are bland and mired in an overwhelmingly austere production. Velvet backing vocals and drumbeats bordering on hip-hop (Boogie Street) dissolve the maundering image upon which Cohen founded a career. The vague delicacy of the music on &quot;Ten new Songs&quot; suggests that Cohen's real interest is in his upcoming, 13th volume of poetry. Songs void of any musical vision such as &quot;Here it Is,&quot; &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; and &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; are left so bare as to be Buddhist chants. A fitting effect, actually, as Cohen Spent the last nine years at Mount Baldy, a Zen monastery outside Los Angeles.is waning. That is not necessarily a bad thing, however.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|After seeing the DVD &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; I continuously played the songs from it over and over again.  I am not really a fan of love songs, but these were so beautiful, and so touching they had to be repeated.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor both sing so beautifully and compliment each other with there individual styles.  I recomend that the movie be seen, and the CD be bought.  It was amazing!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|So what if it's not ska/punk?  Why should the band keep repeating itself?  The bottom line is that this is a CD full of some great songs, regardless of style.  As usual the lyrics are clever and full of references to Gwen's love life.  There are some beautiful songs here, Running, Underneath It All, Don't Let Me Down are my favorites.  It's a great CD and I think you'll love it!
B000002J29|4.0|As much as I would like to give this album 5 stars, as most of the reviewers here have done, I just can't. <br />This CD just doesn't sound as good as it should, especially for one with the &quot;Definitive Edition Remaster&quot; label.  It sounds somewhat muffled:  You can hear the high end, but Mike Rutherford's bass is not well defined and most of Steve Hacket's guitar playing is buried in the mix.  1972's &quot;Genesis Live&quot; had a much more open sound with every instrument given the room to come through clearly and cleanly.  Maybe this should have been a &quot;Definitive Edition Remix and Remaster&quot;.<br />While Phil Collins gives an excellent rendition of &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; (the highlight of the album), I would much rather have heard Peter Gabriel on the other pre-Trick Of The Tail songs.  (He WAS with the band for the &quot;Lamb&quot; tour). Phil does a decent job singing Gabriel's parts, but the songs just don't have the same feel and I could have done without his improvisation on a couple of songs.<br />Of course, one of the reason's I love the band's music so much is Phil's extremely fluid and musical playing and though Chester Thompson does an adequate job on this live album, he is NOT playing the songs as they were on the albums.  There are a lot of intricate fills missing on some of the songs, and to me, they don't sound as dynamic because of this.  <br />Now, the positive:  The song selection is perfect (although it would have been nice to hear more from &quot;Lamb&quot;, and in my opinion &quot;Afterglow&quot; is a weak song), the band plays excellently, and Phil does get to play on a couple of songs.   <br />So in the end, it's a very good live album, just not perfect.
0060977493|5.0|Absolutely the best book I have ever read--by far!!  As an addict for literatue, I have digested a number of different works over my lifetime.  Although many have engaged, evoked and/or even enthralled me, none has ever left a mark as meaningful as this one.  Not only does Arundhati Roy weave a wonderous tale of family, fear and misfortune--the words written on each and every page are fiction at its finest.  ACOLLADES for ARUNHATI!!!<br />As an avid fan of this particular piece of prose, The God of Small Things has been at the top of my recommended reading list for the past few years.  I am currently in possession of my 6th copy due to those (borrowers of the book) who have since felt the same...<br />The God of Small Things is no minimal matter, it's is worth so much more than the mere words mentioned above...a must read!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|One can only speculate about how great a part timing plays in determining whether or not any particular film is a success or failure at the box office.  I suspect that had \\"Pearl Harbor\\" been released three or four months later than it was - in say September rather than June of 2001 - it might have been able to ride the wave of renewed American patriotism that accompanied that other Day of Infamy, the September 11th terrorist attacks - and found itself some true financial glory.  As it is, the film will probably now enjoy a more lucrative life in its home video incarnation than it might otherwise have done under more normal circumstances.  So I guess, in some ways, the film's timing ends up being fortuitous after all.<br />Even from the start, one could see that \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was designed as a bald-faced attempt to replicate the unprecedented success of \\"Titanic.\\"  One is only amazed at how completely it fails.  In both films a simplistic love story has been grafted onto an historic event of monumental tragedy, one that is familiar to the audience beforehand, comes mostly at the end, and offers scads of special effects wizards gainful employment in bringing the episode to life on the screen.  In many ways, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is simply the biggest, loudest and costliest example of that strange hybrid genre known as the \\"chick flick/war movie.\\"  (In this way, I guess filmmakers feel they have the whole date-night crowd covered).  Somehow, one expects to find romance on a cruise ship.  It feels right there.  A romantic story seems somehow less apropos as the foundation for a film on this particular subject.  In fact, the love triangle scenario that makes up fully the first half of this film's enormous three-hour running time is of such surpassing banality that one begins to wonder if anyone bothered to read the script before the actors were pushed out in front of the cameras.  For it is quite obvious that all the creative minds engaged in bringing this film to completion were focused far more on the massive reconstructed sets, elaborate explosions and jaw dropping special effects than on anything so simple and banal as character development or thematic depth.<br />It would be hard to imagine three less interesting characters than Rafe (catch the All-American hero name yet!), Danny and Evelyn to serve as the focal point for a film on this important a subject.  The first two (played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are childhood buddies, now turned bomber pilots, who happen to fall in love with the same beautiful nurse (played by Kate Beckinsale).  Just think back to the complex characters at the core of \\"From Here to Eternity.\\"  In that film, so absorbing and grand were those figures and the situations in which they found themselves that the Pearl Harbor attack actually stayed, for the most part, in the background.  In \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" we are never allowed to forget that the sole purpose for the movie's existence is the attack sequence.  Every moment of the first half is painful to watch - from the awkward and silly first meetings, to the sappy and drippy love scenes, to the inevitable fistfight between the two best friends just hours before they will be called upon to demonstrate brotherhood in action for a greater cause.  Rick, the main character in \\"Casablanca,\\" uttered the famous truism that the travails of three insignificant people don't \\"amount to a hill of beans\\" in the face of events of global importance - and that philosophy has never seemed more on the money than in the case of \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  But then when you are fretting over making back those untold millions you've lavished on your star-studded production, you don't dare allow yourself to entertain such subversive thoughts.  I hate to have to say this but the pasteboard love story that weakly props up \\"Pearl Harbor\\" ends up being an insult to both those who survived and those who perished in the holocaust.<br />What is NOT an insult to their memories, however, is theattack sequence itself.  Here the wretched movie almost redeems itself, for not only is this scene breathtakingly realized in its complexity and scope, but it also captures the poignancy of the devastation in amazingly graphic terms. The gruesomeness of much of the death and carnage put before us makes us fully appreciate, for the first time I think, the enormity of the horror and suffering that accompanied that event.  \\"Pearl Harbor\\" justifies its brilliant excesses by bringing this moment to epic life for a whole generation who has heretofore probably encountered it only as a highlighted study note in some dry high school or college textbook.  For a glorious half hour or so, the filmmakers husband all the resources of modern special effects to plunge us into an epochal moment in our nation's history.  Herr, indeed, is technological excess employed in a salutary purpose.<br />The advantage in seeing \\"Pearl Harbor\\" on video rather than in the theatre is that, in the latter venue, one could only snooze through the torpid first half and wake refreshed when the bombs started dropping and the guns firing.  Now, with the power of the remote in one's hand, one can simply fast forward to all the good parts and leave the sappy ones behind.the attack sequence itself.

B000002UB6|4.0|George Martin's oppinions from The Beatles Anthology perhaps sums it up as did Paul's comments: &quot;We pretty much showed the audience how a band breaks up.&quot; As a result, this isn't too many Beatles fans' favorite (I do remember one cynical reviewer who &quot;hated&quot; the Beatles say it was her favorite).  Still, despite the uneven production and apathy, there are some great moments, many of them from the legendary rooftop concert (their last live performance).<br />It starts out with John's wry humor before he joins Paul on &quot;Two of Us&quot; (though this is Paul's song, both John and Paul shine brightly together, something that happened less frequent in the latter days. George's &quot;I Me Mine&quot; articulates the real dilemna behind the breakup, although Spector overproduces it with unnecessary strings. He does the same on &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (the versions on Past Masters 2 and Anthology 2 are better). While we're on the subject, I agree with Paul that &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; could've done without the cheezy choir! Too bad his request wasn't granted to remove them and tone down the strings. As a result, the movie version is better, with Billy Preston on organ instead of Spector's wall of obnoxiousness.  To be fair to Phil, he is a talented producer (take his work with the Ronettes, the Crystals, and the Righteous Brothers, in addition to his work with John Lennon and George Harrison's solo albums), though he seems to get more in the way here.  I'd love to see a soundtrack available with tracks as you hear them in the movie!  Perhaps that's in the planning (let's keep our fingers crossed).<br />&quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; is another rare example of Paul and John working well together- mixing 2 songs together. &quot;One After 909&quot; is fun and spirted, and Billy Preston's piano adds to it (though the 1963 is superior). &quot;For You Blue&quot; is a fun shuffle by George, with a cool slide by John (&quot;Elmore James has nothing on him,&quot; replies George). <br />&quot;Let It Be&quot; (Paul's ode to his late mother, the &quot;Mother Mary&quot; expressed in the song) has a better guitar solo than the muddy one on Past Masters. Phil, why did you only give us 50 seconds of &quot;Dig It&quot; (the version in the film is longer)? &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; almost sounds like it belonged on Plastic Ono Band. &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; is a catchy and wry love song to Yoko. <br />&quot;Get Back&quot; is fun and catchy, a highlight both on this album and the movie, since it captured the Beatles live on the rooftop. John wryly thanks the audience &quot;I hope we passed the audition!&quot; Don't worry, John- you did. However, Paul's hopes for the Beatles to &quot;get back&quot; were dashed at this point.
B00003CXTF|3.0|The cliched love triangle of the 3 main characters who display all of the depth and nuance of an oak barrel and the action scenes.  The other characters are merely props saying such overused historical one liners such as &quot;Have we awakened a sleeping giant?&quot; (truly awe-inspiring). The movie deserves credit for its fine photographic work and first rate special effects.  If I could rate each piece separately, it would be 5 stars for F/x and 1 star for the story.  It is sad that such an important event in our history was used as a prop to support an incredibly banal plot.  If you waited to see this on video, consider yourself lucky. Finally, the film was far too long.  There was nothing of any significance of any of these characters that should  have taken more than 5 minutes to develop.
B000002UWW|5.0|This album really does capture a good mix of how the Chilis have jumped from punk, funk, and rock and kept fresh. <BR>Higher Ground- Classic cover and only shows how much quality Stevie Wonder had.<BR>True Men Don't Kill Coyotes- good performance song that any band could use.<BR>If You Want Me to Stay- just a good groove song for any occasion.<BR>Under the Bridge- Great song for dawn watching, espeically if you're getting off-work.<BR>Fire- a cover that is decent and shows how they learned from Hendrix.<BR>Show Me Your Soul- good track influenced by George Clinton.<BR>Taste the Pain- A song that could be put in any soundtrack with relationship problems.<BR>Get up and Jump- This is not a depressing song.<br />Other songs that should be put on this in further editions.<BR>Breaking the Girl- good drum background.<BR>Power of Equality- B side, but good stuff.<BR>Soul to Squeeze- a thoughtful song.
B000007OY0|5.0|I was one of the few who went to see this movie when it was originally released in theaters. I think I went back 2 or 3 times to see it again and cried at the end when Morgan (Red) is walking to meet his friend Andy (Tim Robbins) on the beach. This movie totally blew me away. The long length was even better because it made you feel as though you were incarcerated all those years as well. I felt I was an inmate in that evil wardens prison along with Red and Andy. Morgan Freemans narration is so spectacular and right on key that I think he should've won an Oscar just for his narration of this movie. And believe it or not a tear still trickles at the end when I watch this movie on TV. A fine,fine,masterpiece of a movie.Nothing that year or since has matched the greatness of this motion picture.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I can't believe the reviews of this movie were so bad.  This is a great action movie, with or without bare breasts.  It has lots of plot twists and surprises.  John Travolta was great even though they made him look ugly.  Don't look away for a few seconds or you'll miss something.  Even with all the action there is some plot and interesting information to think about after the movie if you are paying attention.

078062999X|5.0|For those who are not very familiar with Shakespere, or do not fully understand the dialogue, this version of HAMLET will be very helpful and educational and VERY enjoyable!  Kenneth Branagh's performance in this film is beyond excellent.  He gives the character Hamlet life.  He makes the character so incredibly believable that you think you are in the movie along side him.  The other actors include Julie Christie (Gertrude), Derek Jacobi (Claudius), Richard Briers (Polonias), and Kate Winslet (Ophelia) just to name a few, are all excellent as well.  The most humorous parts in the movie are between the characters of Hamlet (Branagh) and Polonias).  Their scenes together make you laugh out loud.  The ending is incredible.  It is extremely emotional and draws the viewer in.  I was in tears when the movie ended.  It was that stirring.<br />Patrick Doyle's haunting music is magnificent.  The fanfare at the beginning of the movie is just to die for.  The background music is simply superb.  I highly recommend that you buy not only the movie, but the CD as well.  All in all, this is a must see movie.  Never before have  any of Shakespere plays been brought to the screen so beautifully.
B00005B36H|2.0|This is not a Tool album.  It should have been made under the name of A Perfect Circle.  Technically, this is a very good album.  The sound is high quality, and the musical ability of the band is top notch.  However, it isn't a Tool album.  The songs are much too peaceful for Tool, and almost all the songs lack the haunting darkness of previous albums.  &quot;Schism&quot;, the first radio hit, is about the only song that is reminiscent of previous songs.  A good Perfect Circle album, but a poor effort by Tool.
0393317552|2.0|I was very disappointed by the book.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  Basically, the book reduces human cultural history to a series of accidents: accidents of geography and accidents of biological evolution.  The scope of Diamond's argument is wonderful and I applaud his efforts.  Diamond surveys 15,000 years of human history in terms of plant, animal and germ evolution.  If this is the first time you've seen the way humans are at the mercy of germ mutation, it may take your breath away.  On the other hand, Diamond leaves no role for human character to play a part.  Perhaps it is hopelessly old fashion to suggest individual responsibility exists, but I think we are asking for an ecological disaster if we abandon all efforts to cultivate it. In summary, I was turned off by the narrow-minded materialism.<br />The book is structured as an apologia from a European biologist to a politician of New Guinea. At the beginning of the book, the author introduces us to Yali, a young politician of New Guinea. The politician asks the author why the 'Europeans' have so much and peoples of New Guinea so little. Time and again, the book returns to this simple question.<br />It might have been interesting to question the premise of Yali's question.  Have Europeans really hit the jackpot?  Unfortunately, we don't inquire into the nature of jackpots.  The only measure of success is power and wealth.<br />Diamond's answer is Darwinian: it was an accident.  Europeans just 'happened to be' in the right place at the right time. Geography, weather patterns, and access to species suitable for domestication made European success inevitable.  I won't argue that random events play an important role in shaping human history, but Diamond's answer is simply uninformative. It could be summarized as Europeans got lucky because they were lucky. What does that tell us?<br />I can't imagine Yali to taking this answer seriously.  If you grew up in New Guinea with European tourists blundering through your village taking photographs and passing out trinkets, would you accept an explanation that it was all an accident?  That explanation would only work for the tourist who wants to avoid feeling connected to the people they meet along the way.  Maybe that's why the book seems to go on and on and on without coming to a conclusion.  Diamond is has no answer for Yali, but hopes to put him to sleep.<br />A far more insightful (and controversial) history of the 'human community' can be found in William McNeill's 'Rise of the West' or 'Plagues and People.' Yali would be well served by adding these to his reading list.<br />Finally, the title of this book is misleading. Germs get a fair amount of attention, but 'guns' and 'steel' go almost unmentioned. According to the index, the term 'gun' gets 8 references during the 400+ page book. The term 'steel' gets only 4 references. Germs get about 80. A title along the lines of 'Geography and Germs: how weather and disease shape human cultures' would have been more accurate.ugh your village taking photographs and passing out trinkets, would you accept an explanation that it was all an accident?

B00005OAJ1|4.0|Jack and Kyle are obviously having a ball.  Though clearly self-indulgent, they take this self-indulgence to the level of art form.  Adolescent only in that it is pot and sex driven, this music has a heart and a genuineness that is most certainly art.  While the music and content do become repetitive, one stays truly charmed throughout the album, willingly hanging on for dear life until the next gem presents itself.  Everyone I talk to who knows this album becomes really happy at its mention.  My only serious complaint would be the poor production value.  This music is meant to be played LOUD, but it is impossible to reach the level of satisfaction without the music becoming muddled and unlistenable.  At times the volume levels of the sketches drop off the map.  I hope the boys get enough juice off this to get a better producer for next time.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Unless you're a teeny bopper girl under the age of 15 with no concept and knowledge of ART, MUSIC, and understanding of a world where talent doesn't consist of how good a dancer you are or how good a person looks, this is not an album you want to be near.  <br />I'm sorry, but the music corporation knows how to sell glitz and glamour to children, labeling it music and art when it's closer to something that of smoke, mirrors, and a broadway play for entertainment.  It's a facade in the music industry that brings us lack of creativity in albums like these.  <br />Focusing on this album, it's fallin short of any so-called maturity from teen pop with lyrics only hormone enrage teeny girls can relate to.  Is this the message we want to give to children(teen girls)?  &quot;I'm a slave for you&quot;? &quot;Boys&quot;? &quot;Cinderella&quot;?  I thought we've outgrown this stage in a age of America where individuality and freedom of choice rights are our focus.  The music is formulaic, unimaginitive, with synthecized sounds as generic as any other low quality album.<br />Music is art.  This is not music.  This is not art.<br />This is a broadway play turned teeny bopper.  The smoke and mirrors of the music industry.
B00005OWIU|4.0|John Williams has the ability to do things with music that few artists can imitate.  With every movie score he produces, he is able to put twists and turns in it that leave the listener wanting more.  His latest offering in &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a perfect example.<br />The first two tracks on the CD present quite clearly that this score is going to be something special.  There are times when John Williams' work, as brilliant as it always is, can sometimes be a tad bit boring.  An example of this is his music for &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;  While the music is some of his best to date, there is not much variation and it can quickly bore a common listener.  What Williams does in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, however, is anything but boring.  Williams sounds reenergized here, and there are several tracks on the CD (Track 1, Track 2, Track 9, and Track 19, just to give some examples) that give proof of that.  I have listened to and own many of Williams' movie scores, but I don't believe I have ever heard something like this from him before.<br />Another thing I want to comment on is the look of the CD booklet itself.  Strangely reminiscent of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; CD booklets, if you ask me.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I just found it interesting, is all.<br />One particular track I want to point out is Track 11.  Williams rarely, if ever, does vocal pieces for his movie scores, but Track 11 is a haunting display of a spooky Christmas tune turned on its ear.  At first I thought there was something wrong with the CD, but that is not the case.  This is just another example of Williams trying something new.  One thing you can't deny, and this is evident of all his scores, is that the man is always experimenting.  Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't.  But I admire the man for constantly trying to do different things.<br />Once again, John Williams has done a great job.  It's not up to par with his classic &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, but it's pretty darn close.  I applaud Williams for giving the listener something new to listen to.Jurassic Park&quot;, but it's pretty darn close.  I applaud Williams for giving the listener something new to listen to.

B00005JKT8|4.0|My husband and I saw Kate &amp; Leopold on New Year's Day.  We both liked the movie very much...it was like taking a step back into a time when people were more genteel...more caring, etc.<BR>Hugh Jackman's role fit him like a &quot;glove&quot;..he was perfect for it!  And, Meg Ryan's role as the &quot;non-believer&quot; suited her, in my opinion, as she generally looks like she doesn't quite &quot;get it&quot;..or &quot;believe it.&quot;  (I only wish..and once again, this is in my very humble opinion...that Ms. Ryan, along with many other &quot;stars&quot;... would realize how AWFUL they look with haircuts that resemble a child playing with scissors!!!!!!)<BR>However, all in all, if one is looking for a movie that you don't have to &quot;think&quot; too much, you can just enjoy it for what it is...a nice movie...then I would recommend this movie...and have...to anyone.
0792107683|5.0|This film has a great setting.  Very realistic an unlike most earlier western shoot-em ups has a very good story line.  Beautiful scenery, good acting by all.  As a young man, this is the first western I saw where a barroom fight actually drew some blood. Good performances by Alan Ladd, Van Hefflin, Jack Palance and Brandon de Wilde.  A movie worth watching.

You want to eat them all at once because they are so wonderful, yet you don't want to finish the box because there are no more after that. What a decision! Well...eat the whole box, wait a year and read them all again!<br />We need more writers like Doyle. We have too many politically correct, bubble book softies who want to please society to make a fortune! This alters a person's writing and reduces it to mush. I like the classics because they are uncompromising, original and no where near politically correct. Sherlock Holmes stories are the best!
B00005QG9J|4.0|with the explosion of \\"rock-rap\\", or whatever category you want to slap most of the good rock music of the 90's into, incubus, in my opinion, tried to steer clear of any stereotypes that a useless music critic could pin to them.  with the release of make yourself, the media pushed incubus into a direction of soft-easy listening rock.  unfortunetly most of morning view has shunned the idea of \\"soft-rock\\" incubus.  although maybe 5 of the 13 songs are slow-acoustic songs, incubus' fresh, explosiveness still shines through the muck of average radio-friendly songs.  nice to know you, circles, blood on the ground, and especially under my umbrella scream s.c.i.e.n.c.e. while are you in? reflects the funk (enjoy) side of the band.  anyways, don't let extensive radio play decide for you, get this cd and hear for yourself, incubus can still rock....  and maybe some of you will actually listen to what he is saying and learn a thing or two.  \\"i refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see.\\"
B00005QIPH|1.0|I'm writing this in an attempt to make people save their valuable money.<br />To answer The Strokes' question, &quot;no, this is not it.&quot;  <br />It's very rarely that I, a lover of music, will ever become annoyed or disgruntled at an album on the first listen after everyone tells me...&quot;hey...you've gotta get this album!&quot;  After all, that's how I got into Radiohead, Sparklehorse, etc. etc.<br />Well, this album clearly annoys and disgruntles me.  First of all, every song sounds the same...and it's not &quot;the good same.&quot;  The tone of each and every song is flat and fuzzy, and the vocals are blended into everything else...clearly terribly produced.  You may think fuzz is good...but not here.  Try taking your favorite albums, and turning the tone ALL the way down.  That's what you're getting here.<br />Secondly, they've all got the same uninspiring, annoying chords and riffs...over and over again.  Now, it's one thing if the chords and riffs are catchy and repetitive.  It's one thing if the repetition is catchy...of course this isn't the case.  The lead guitar screeches and doesn't compliment any part of any song, and it makes you wonder if Hellen Keller (if she was still alive) picked up a guitar fir the first time, and randomly put her fingers down on frets.<br />Third of all...and the thing that annoys me possibly the MOST...is that it's not even ROCK, and these guys are being called the &quot;saviors of rock and roll.&quot;  Okay, MAYBE &quot;Last Nite&quot; sounds vaguely like Tom Petty (the instrumental sections sound similar to early Heartbreakers)....which is what I assumed the entire album would be like (you'd assume that a band's first single would be reflective of their entire style, wouldn't you), but everything else sounds like the same crappy punk.<br />And it gives me a headache.  How the hell are bands able to get away with this crap?  Most bands like this haven't even been critically acknowledged...which is a GOOD thing.  This music deserves no praise.<br />This isn't good music.  If you want the TRUE next innovators of music...the true saviors...buy Sigur Rós' beautiful album Agaetis Byrjun.  Listen to that, and you'll laugh at the pathetic idea that people are calling The Strokes the &quot;saviors of music.&quot;
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrmann created a spectacular feast for the eyes, ears, and imagination when he created Moulin Rouge.  Throwing convention to the wind, he managed to give us glimpses into the energy and excitement created by the legendary Moulin Rouge and married it to an engaging fairy tale -- punctuated with pop music. You haven't seen anything like it!  <br />The movie is full of surprises (i.e. the stars doing their own singing), which makes the movie more endearing. The costumes are STUNNING, the set designs, choreography and editing are pure fun. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman affect the right combination of innocence, campiness and elegance to make you want to watch this one over and over. <br />When I saw Moulin Rouge on the big screen, I immediately decided that I'd have to have the movie in my collection.  The DVD gives you enough extras to more than justify the purchase.
0446310786|5.0|The story is set during the great depression of the 1930's, in a small town in the southern United States. Scout and Jem Finch are the motherless children of a lawyer in the town of Maycomb, who spend their carefree summer days with their friend Dill. Their sunny-sweet world is turned upside down when their father is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, who is accused of committing a terrible crime against a white woman. The children are exposed to the narrow-mindedness and hypocrisy of their community, and the discrimination faced by black Americans in their town. <br />This book is without a doubt my all-time favorite, and is easily endearing for many reasons. The characters are varied and colorful, from Ms. Maudie, the children's acid-tongued neighbor, to Miss Stephanie Crawford, the neighborhood gossip, from Mr. Avery, the pot-bellied gainsayer, to Arthur `Boo' Radley, the mysterious recluse who lives in the `haunted' house down the street. Above all, the most engaging characters are the children - innocent, sweet, mischievous and absolutely delightful.  <BR>The thing I liked most about this book was the flow and innocence of the narrative. The entire book is told as seen through the eyes of a young child, making the language straightforward and easy to comprehend. The style is bold and forthright, putting forward debatable issues with a candid frankness.    <BR>While it is a book with a serious theme and a solemn message, the book is interwoven with instances of carefree childishness and subtle comedy. The perfect balance of solemnity and pleasantry make this a hearty, wholesome book.<BR>This book is both emotionally thought-provoking and educationally stimulating. As Harper Lee's first and only novel, To Kill A Mockingbird is a touching story of innocence and humanity that I believe everyone should read.
B00005JKMO|1.0|Even something like Driven was better than this very badly edited account of the life of the &quot;greatest&quot;. <br />I will warn right now that to explain this badly edited movie, I have to reveal many spoilers in my review, so be warned right now. However, it does not really matter, as most people already know the biography of Muhammad Ali anyway.<br />Truly astonishing. How a very interesting life turned into one of the most pretentious and awful movies I have ever seen still amazes me. Before watching this movie, I did not know much about Muhammad Ali besides the fact that he was one of the greatest boxers (if not the greatest) in the history of boxing. What I learned from this movie was not much more. <br />This is probably the most horribly edited movie I have ever seen. While it begins interesting, the story loses coherence as it jumps from one place in his life, to another. In fact, I did not even know the movie took place over a period of ten years until I read the biography afterwards, which helped fill in all the missing places in the movie, and was very interesting, whereas the movie was dull and boring. I did not know there was a 3 1/2 year gap between his arrest and the overturning of his conviction (the movie makes it almost seem like a couple months), they barely mentioned the restaurant chain in the movie, we never actually found out that it was a failed attempt, and most of all, the most confusing parts of the movie dealt with his love life. It was not known to any of us who were watching if the first woman, Sonji Roi played by Jada Pinkett Smith, actually ever married Ali. Because all they showed afterwards was her walking away from him, and then we see him dating someone else, we figured that they were never actually married, when in fact, they were, and the marriage was annulled. We also barely saw the marriage to Belinda the second woman, and then the third, Veronica is barely in the story anyway. We only find out at the very end that he divorced Belinda, to marry Veronica, and then apparently married another person, afterwards. (Are you counting? That's four wives.)<br />I thought this movie was supposed to convey the greatness of Muhammad Ali, and show why he was so beloved by so many fans. All I saw was a man with many troubles in his love life and who was way too cocky. Where is this greatness that everyone is talking about? Surely it exists in the real Ali, but I don't see any of that greatness in this movie. <br />The movie was not enough about the REAL Ali. Most of it was about his troubles with boxing, and the movie showed to us the face that he showed to the press and the outside world. But we do not get any of the real stuff we should be knowing; his dreams, hopes, real troubles...Perhaps it would have been better if they started earlier in his life too. Starting from 1964 when he became the World Heavyweight Champion was not a good choice, as there really is no goal for him from then on except to defend his title - I mean, he already became the World Champion, so the rest of the movie loses its meaning, as all he wants to do is regain it (Remember, 2nd time around is always not as thrilling). Also, if they recounted earlier aspects of his life, we would have more background knowledge of him, and perhaps understand the character a bit more. It would also have been wise to go past where they did stop, and continue through to his struggles with Parkinson's Disease, which would have also been interesting. <br />Another problem I had was the incredibly long parts that should have been cut out. There was a scene several minutes long where he was just walking along and thinking. While a minute of this would have been nice, as it also gives the audience the feeling that he is thinking, and gives us a little insight into his character, several minutes worth of this is rather tiring and pointless. <br />Still, there were some good points. The point where he refused to be drafted, and the recounting ofthat was very interesting, if not because of the actual movie, but because of the real events. The problem with the movie at this point was there was no struggle here. After he got arrested, a couple minutes later in the movie, the Supreme Court overrules it in his favour. We don't see the struggle, or his love for boxing here, as he struggled through those 3 1/2 years, and so we also don't appreciate the magnitude of the Supreme Court's ruling. <br />Jamie Foxx did a very nice job, small as it was, and I also thought Mario von Peebles who played Malcolm X did a great performance, although that role was tiny. Will Smith's performance was excellent, despite the overwhelming incoherence of the movie, which made it look horrible. After reading the biography, I understood his performance much more, and was that much more impressed.<br />Perhaps if it was edited well, this movie actually had the great potential to be one of the year's best. Instead, it is at the other extreme, as one of 2001's worst. <br />And so, I cannot recommend this movie, but rather have to recommend people to never watch this worthless and horrible film. Read the biography instead. It was indescribably much more entertaining, interesting, and moving.
B00005IBGQ|1.0|This CD stinks! I can't believe people are enjoying this music.....It could not be more boring and dull.
B000050XEI|5.0|There has always been something soothing in Enya's voice. Her latest, &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is no exception. The majority of songs on this album are a little more mellow, making the music seem to flow around you. &quot;Wild Child&quot; is the most upbeat song on the album and is definitely worth listening to more then once. &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; seems to have a strong, underlining strength to it, and &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi&quot; is another winner. Then anything she does in Gaelic usually is.<br />Overall, this would be a welcome addition to any Enya fan. People have been complaining about the running time of the CD, and while it is shorter then previous albums, it is no shorter then anything else, really. No matter what the running time is, though, Enya has produced a beautiful work, yet again.
B00004STPT|5.0|You will put in this CD and feel as if you are the gladiator.  It will give you a rush and relax you in the same stroke.  Wonderful.
B00000IONU|4.0|I first heard of The White Stripes when I read a review of one their gigs by an English pop music journalist who claimed that they were &quot;the best band in the world&quot;.  Well, normally, that would be the kind of thing that would send me running several miles in the opposite direction, cause if an English music journalist thinks you're that good, chances are you're crap.<br />Nevertheless, I bought this, their first album, and was gratified to find that even without a bass player, this brother/sister combination from Detroit kicks some serious arse.  Jack White's whiny white-boy-sings-the-blues-voice has surprising power, and his sister Meg White bangs her clearly primitivo drumkit almost as though nobody had ever played the drums before.  My favourite track is &quot;The Big Three Killed My Baby&quot;, even if it (disappointingly) turns out to be about the dangers of modern car design, as opposed to something wilder and weirder, but they make up for it with sheer conviction of delivery.  Jack White's humongously enormous guitar sound makes the need for a bassist irrelevant.  Meg White's drums are thoroughly...uhh...organic.  I've just bought their new album and HAVEN'T EVEN LISTENED TO IT YET - that's how much I trust this band.  The Robert Johnson cover is suitably raucous and sloppy.  The Dylan cover may not be as elegant as the original (how can you top Emmy Lou Harris on backing vocals?) but it has real soul.<br />The trouble with listening to Original versions of the covers on this album is that whole rock-as-Penguin-Classic syndrome.  I intellectually accept that the Stones' original version of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is the best version, but the fact remains that I find the Guns &amp; Roses version more exciting.   Likewise with the White Stripes.  You can tell me that Zep did this sort of thing better - but the Stripes are younger, hornier, more dedicated and less inhibited by a sense of mission.  Also their tracks are a lot shorter.  Whichis a good thing.<br />Listen.  Hear.  Feel.  This is why we like rock.
6302800420|5.0|There have been numerous movies around dwelling on a man slipping into a woman's role. But Tootsie's outstanding. Just the make-up job is terrific and Dustin's so very real after his abrupt &quot;sex change&quot;... It's great laughs and it's great entertainment for the whole family. No sex, no crime, no foul language, yet super fun for all ages. A  must to see!!! And: The fun doesn't wear off when watching this movie again. I must have watched it at least 6 times by now... and love it every single time!
0385505833|3.0|You should read Skipping Christmas, it is a good book.<br />You should not buy Skipping Christmas, it is not a good novel.<br />After hitting a cold spell with the Street Lawyer and the Testament, Grisham proved again that he is an excellent writer with The Painted House.  This short little novel is also well written, humourous and entertaining.<br />Every neighborhood has a family who decorates their house for Christmas in every way possible.  They put up lights and statues and snowmen and everything else.  In Skipping Christmas, those people all move into one neighborhood.  This book is a satire.  Each family in the neighborhood represents a slightly different trait in looking at Christmas.  Luther and Nora Krank represent the desire to not have to participate in all of the meaningless nonsense of parties and cards and decorating.  The novel concludes with a tidy little episode that doesn't quite warm the heart, but does bring a smile to the face.<br />...It is only 177 pages (small pages) and can easily be read in afternoon...<br />...this could have gone directly to movie form, which is obviously what it is geared to.  As mentioned earlier, there are no real characters in the story.  Every single person is a stereotype, from the cops collecting for charity to the office Christmas parties to the boy scouts selling Christmas trees.  Visually, this would make a great movie because there are many comedic moments, but for a novel it is too lightweight.<br />Also, the ending isn't original.  It reminds me of the movie Funny Farm.  While a lot of ideas are borrowed or shared, the ending also is very predictable.  There was really no other way out of the jam Luther and Nora got themselves in.<br />I'm glad I read Skipping Christmas.  It entertained me for a few hours.  I'm also glad I checked it out from the Library instead of buying it.  If I'm going to buy a novel, I want it to last awhile.
0783233477|5.0|A superb film. I was totally hooked. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt are superb. The story is, of course, exceptional. I patricularly liked the engaging way this young whipper snapper (Death) barged his way around in an imperious but strangely charming way with a strong streak of naivite. It was quite funny in many ways. A film to luxuriously drown in!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The cinimetography and visual affects blew me away. I will say though that the movie was a bit &quot;artsy&quot;; it took a little while to get into the rythem of it. If you saw William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1996) and didn't like it you probably won't like this.
B00003CXTG|1.0|It's cornier and dumber that a run of the mill mediocre studio movie from the 1940's but there are still many who insist it's<br />more than just 45 minutes of excellent effects.  Effects that<br />try to be fairly historically accurate and are pretty impressive...but only have impact because we realize this really happened.<br />The film is far too easy to pick on.  Let's I suppose be thankful that a lot of people over-looked the actual quality and worth of the film itself and considered the fact that so much money, time and effort went to remembering and bringing to a new generation a dramatization of what happened oh so many years ago.  If you're going to spend too much money on a film I suppose better they do one that attempts to recreate history.<br />It would really honor the men and women of the armed forces if they had made a better film however.<br />Tora Tora Tora looks like a masterpiece compared to this one, and<br />you really should buy yourself a copy of the infinitely superior<br />From Here to Eternity on DVD.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I own close to a hundred DVDs, and almost none of them have satisfied in the way Fast &amp; The Furious has.  The video quality is as great as you'd come to expect of the DVD format, but what really excels (in my opinion) is the audio.  The soundtrack shifts from treblecharging nu metal to hard-hitting electronica to bass-heavy rap all throughout the movie and never lets you stop for a breather, putting the term ACTION back into &quot;action movie.&quot;  Like many have said already; if you're a home audio enthusiast, this DVD is going to pummel you for roughly ninety minutes.<br />Aside from the feature presentation, the extras have been some of the coolest I've seen yet.  I've viewed far too many DVDs that have a total lackluster collection of &quot;extras;&quot; most of which usually end up being some boring low-quality movie trailers or a few pointless deleted scenes.  With FATF, you get the trailers, the deleted scenes, but also a CG montage, music videos, commentaries, interviews, multiple angle shots of various scenes, &quot;movie magic&quot; spots (which show how some stunts were prepared and executed,) and more.  It's literally a ton of awesome extra material to sift through.  After exploring, you'll wish other DVDs (with the exception of a select few movies, namely Fight Club) had the volume of extra goodies FATF does.<br />The DVD Collector's Edition also comes packaged with a bunch of coupons for racing performance mods and accessories, which is nice if you're into (import) racing, as well as a small leaflet which lists chapter information.  However, it has little to do with the DVD itself.  Moving right along...<br />I recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a fast-paced action movie, period.  Forget the claims that non-racers will hate it, forget the laughable comparisons to &quot;Point Blank&quot; (Patrick Swayze?  Are you kidding?!) and forget the sour apples putting this movie down for &quot;not having enough story&quot; -- how often are memorablestorylines implemented into action thrillers, anyway?  Fast &amp; The Furious is an action movie in its truest form, on all fronts, and is a very impressive DVD package.  Buy it today.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Moulin Rouge almost immediately reminded me of Terry Gilliam's  Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1989).  It's excessively loud, garish, brash theatrical, and full of over-the-top slapstick.  The film also uses the talents of dozens of film technicians to put everything they can afford onto the screen.  The film never quite gets down-right vulgar--but you wonder how far this film will go.  The only clue is that its rated Pg-13... but it seems like it's going to push through that barrier at any moment anyway.  It evokes Keystone Cop slapstick and Allan Carr's (Can't Stop the Music, Broadway's La Cage Aux Folles) excesses sometimes at the same time. It's frenetically edited like an MTV video on speed, but creates such a detailed period opulent fantasy world anyway. It's got the subtlety of a porno-film, but you may just let it run right over you and as you catch you breath decide for all it's faults you like the thing... you really, really like the thing.<br />Moulin Rouge 2001 is a musical by borrowing and twisting,  in sometimes hilariously, sometimes alarming and sometimes unabashedly campy ways, pop music of (mainly) the last thirty years.  What it does with Elton John's Your Song, Madonna's Like a Virgin, Paul McCartney's Silly Love Songs, and The Police's Roxanne is utterly audacious.  If you hold these songs as sacred you will HATE this film.  No, it is not because  all the songs are trashed and ridiculed, sometimes the the tone and attitude of the original song is embraced, though framed differently. Others are definitely turned on their ear.  This idea of mining popular songs to use for a musical is a concept that struck gold in the classic: Singing in the Rain; which only contained a couple of original songs and found several classics to revitalize so successfully as to make them nearly definitive versions.  It's unlikely you'll consider any song performances from this film as definitive versions of the song however.  There's nothing as brilliant as a Donald O'Connor doing the original, Make 'Em Laugh, or as memorable as a Gene Kelly doing Singing in the Rain. Although Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh's Like a Virgin is a number you won't ever forget).  There is however enough energy in every performance and every musical sequence to make you momentarily forget for a while that this film is entertaining but it's an utter mess.<br />The film is a lot like a funny drunken acquaintance whose appeal is infectious if you want it to be, but you know it will eventually wind up tiresome.  There's so much color and cinematic technique on the screen at times you'll feel like Jackson Pollock is splattering film paint at the screen but its not being splattered with hate or anger or contempt.  There's nary a drop of cynicism anywhere in this film and I think anyone who claims the film displays any kind of condescension or contempt for the audience is bringing too many pre-conceived notions into the theater with them.  The movie begs to please the audience in its own giddy over-the top way. Of course the truly cynical will hate it for just that reason.<br />Intentions, energy and spirit are only part of what makes for a successful film experience. Unfortunately for all the go for broke excess and inspired lunacy the film embraces completely in its first hour, by the film's last forty minutes or so, it decides to actually concentrate on its melodramatic plot and corny sentimental love triangle to deliver an overly familiar poignant message about love.  It buckles down and stops throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you. For a little while it concentrates on trying to breath new life into the chestnut of a plot it has saddled itself with by coming up with a couple of minor twists, which feel more repetitious than clever.  The film tries desperately to find a way to cleverly thrust its plot and resolution at us.  We already know exactly where it is going, and pro-longing it doesn't help.  As the film gets quieter, we're remindedhow exhausted we are by what we've seen.<br />Though it's actually a failure this is a film made by people who love not only what they do, but also what film has done in the past. They celebrate their love and passion for film by updating and partially re-inventing the movie musical.  Purists be damned.<br />As over-done as the film was in the movie theaters... so is the DVD.  The image on the disc is impressive, the sound quality a little less than perfect, but the extras are piled on.... and there's even easter eggs to find for even more.<br />You can watch the film with the BEHIND THE RED CURTAIN FEATURE which will reval a series of short vignettes that cover the film's production design and special effect features.  There is even a deleted scene complete with commentary. When a green fairy appears in the corner of the screen, viewers can watch the additional eight segments (which add up to about 23 minutes) and then return to that point in the film when the segment is finished.  It's like the Infini-film features another studio has.  Two feature length commentaries tell how the film was made and then another how it was written.  Exhaustive.. yes... interesting... actually very much so.<br />Disc 2 is loaded with extras of interest to those who truly enjoy this film.

6305313687|4.0|&quot;Get off my f*ckin' court!  This is my house!&quot;  Derek Vinyard is ordering a group of just-defeated blacks off the basketball court, but he's talking about more than basketball.  American History X is the story of how Derek (Edward Norton - Primal Fear, Rounders) tries to break from his skinhead past as well as point his younger brother in the right direction as well.<br />In the opening of the film, Derek kills two black men as they try to steal his truck from his driveway during the night.  His younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong - Pecker, Terminator 2: Judgement Day) witnesses the murders.  With Derek in jail, Danny has started down the same path as Derek.  He has the haircut, the friends, the ideals.  When he turns in a report heralding Mein Kampf, the school's black principal resists the urging of his mother boyfriend (Elliot Gould) to boot him out.  Instead Sweeney (Avery Brooks - TV's Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and Spenser: For Hire) assigns Danny a report on his brother and his influene upon him.  American History X. <br />As Danny writes his report, we learn through flashbacks (black and white) about how Derek bacame who he is; from his father's upbringing to his murder in a poor neighborhood.   We visit the scene on the basketball court, Dereks skinhead &quot;mentor&quot; Cameron (Stacy Keach - TV's Mike Hammer) and a heated and violent family argument.<br />When Derek is finally released from jail after three years, he is a changed man.  His hair has grown out and he sees the wrong of his hatred.  Now he must teach Danny as well.<br />There was controversy surrounding this film prior to its release that goes beyond its content.  For reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, director Tony Kaye wanted his name removed from the film.  Apparently New Line Cinema was releasing its own cut of it, which Kaye described as a &quot;rape, a total abuse of creativity.&quot;  I have yet to be able to figure out what was different about the cuts that raised such an issue with Kaye. <br />The plot of the movie is rather predictable.  What helps raise it above that mediocrity is the acting, particulary Norton.  He gives a performance worthy of the nomination it received for Best Actor in this year's Academy Awards.   As the pre-incarcerated Danny, he is a powerful and vile character.  His skinhead rhetoric is delivered with force and conviction, and the way he kills one of the would-be thieves is one of the most gruesome acts I've seen.  Once he's released, the reformed Derek is portrayed as soft and afraid by Norton, an amazing transformation.   Furlong and Brooks give fine performances as well.  Guy Torry, in a supporting role as a black co-worker in the prison laundry, gives an notable performance.<br />American History X was a very thought-provoking film.  The ideals of the neo-Nazi skinheads are certainly disturbing and the conviction by which this ideals are upheald by Vinyard and the others is overwhelming.  This is an excellent film and only some tweaks in the plot development keep it from being a superior one.  'Til whenever, remember . . . that ain't butter.
B00005Q45W|4.0|The old curmudgeon is mellowing, but he has not lost his edge.  These songs are stripped down and elegant.  Not as raw as The Future or as nicely orchestrated as the Live CD, but omg, who else sings with such soul?  or writes lyrics with such intelligence?  Any serious Cohen fan gotta own this.  Anyone who is not a serious Cohen fan is missing something.  Buy this one just for the beautiful vocal duet on Alexandra Leaving.  The whole album will grow on you in a slow, insidious way, like the depression following a bad drunk.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek is one of the best movies I have seen ina long time. It is funny, has good animation, and has interisting characters. Characters include Shrek, who goes on a quest to get the deed to his swamp back. He has to rescue Princess Fiona (with the help of a hilarious lovable donkey that can talk) from a castle guarded by a dragon so Lord Farquaad can marry and be a king.
0553328255|5.0|Artur Conan Doile's Sherlock Holmes is amazing. I enjoy following Holmes' deductions, made by his incredible mind, based upon the smallest details, not observed by anyone else, leaving Watson behind in his own conclusions.<br />The whole book is based upon Watson's narrative of Holmes' crime solving career. Holmes and he travel to solve the cases which have been abandoned by government officials. Watson describes Holmes' investigations and observations, giving way to Holmes' powerful mind and being lost himself(in the deductions that is). It is incredible how the smallest details become the most important ones in solving an intricate case. <br />The cases are told through the &quot;mist&quot; in Watson's mind. He is never able to keep up and follow Holms' deductive train of thoughts. He is usually left behind by Sherlock Holmes and the reader, of course.<br />Sherlock Holmes can be viewed as a piece of a puzzle to make a perfect human. His calmness and mind trained in some aspects should be an example for many to follow. Disregard Holmes arrogance, coldness, and selfishness,add a few characteristics and you have an almost perfect human.<br />In overall this book is a must read. It is full of adventure and intrigue. Personally, I enjoy this book because yu can actually try and solve the mystery yourself(with enough details given, that is.) Read this, you won't regret the tme you have spent on it.
B00005OWEG|3.0|It's great to own the film on DVD but clearly either they didn't care about the film when they issued this quickly or are planning a bigger budget boxed set similar to the Godfather DVDs. It really would help to have commentary on this as the making of the film obviously is legendary and it would flesh out the Heart of Darkness documentary well. That aside, the new scenes are obviously a mixed bag. I don't have as much trouble as some other commentators about the new material and in some cases, I think it does bring in new elements about the war in general that weren't visible in the first go around - especially the discussion of nationalism and colonialism in Vietnam during the plantation scene. Brando reading Time Magazine is also quite interesting. The bunnies aren't really necessary the second time around, however. But 10,000 extra feet of footage isn't going to help the fact that a) Coppola didn't have an ending and b) had Brando to deal with. The two problems in themselves kept this from being fully framed. He can polish this all he wants but you won't make it the film we all see it can be at its greatest moments - the attack on the beach, the meeting over roast beef - the opening montage, etc. So take it as an interesting exercise and enjoy it for what it is - monumental filmmaking interspaced with a lot of problems.
0140186409|5.0|I first read The Grapes of Wrath about 15 years ago as an assignment in school.  I HATED this book!  I thought it was the most droll, boring, depressing piece of ... I had ever read, at that time anyway.  I read it again a few years ago and was amazed at how wrong I  had previously been!  It may have just been the difference between reading something because I was forced to and reading something because I wanted to, or I may have just been too young and/or naïve to appreciate it back then, I dont know for sure.<br />Anyway, since then, I have gone on to read every other book Steinbeck wrote, and this is by far my favorite!  This is the quintessential American novel and Steinbeck is the quintessential American writer.  His character development, historical knowledge, vivid imagery are amazing, and the underlying sediments of  human goodwill in, granted, often depressing circumstances, should be an example to us all.  The way that Rose of Sharon, by far, the most ego-centric character in the book, winds up committing the most self-less act brought me to tears every time I read this.<br />Anyone who gives this book a bad review is either too young and inexperienced to appreciate it (as I was when I first did), or doesnt know a thing about literature.  Have a mentioned that this is my all-time favorite read (besides also To Kill A Mockingbird)?<br />P.S.  If you do like this, I would also HIGHLY recommend Woody Guthries Seeds of Man, another, much more humorous Okie tale.<br />Also, if your into Steinbeck, check out \\"In Dubious Battle\\", the 2nd best book he wrote.
0440180295|5.0|I loved the positive spin on this book.  The main character is not a typical guy -- through his strange experiences with aliens, soldiers in WWII, family and doctors, he tells his anti-war story convincingly.<br />A very fast read.

B00003CXXR|3.0|The movie is better than the pathetic second one, I'll give it that much.<br />Unfortunately, it does not measure up to the first.

630575067X|5.0|This is the best Star Wars ever.  It starts when Gui-Gon-Jin and Obei-Wan-Kenobi, go on a mission to stop the evil Lord from destroying all good, first they encounter droids, then they encounter droids with sheilds!  With the force, they got away safely in a battle landrover, heading in a spaceship to a planet (Something like that), and meet Jar-Jar, at the a planet.  They get a water car, (I don't know what it's called) and they encounter four underwater monsters.  They Anakin Skywalker, a boy on a desert planet.  After a succesful race on a car of some kind (I don't know the name of that either) and battle the new dark player, Darth Maul.  When they encounter Darth Maul, with his double-lightsaber, Gui-Gon dies, and it's up to Obei-Wan to kill Darht Maul.  I love this story because the fighting is fast and amazing, and because I think it is a nice story.  I still think they need less complicated names.

B00005RFAI|5.0|Missundaztood, Pink's latest release, I feel, is absolutely wonderful. I liked her first album when I purchased it a few years ago, though I thought it had a bit too much pop sound in it. What was evidence of that last comment is totally gone is Missundaztood, where Pink sings, and 'raps', in a totally new voice. There's actually an edge to her voice, and the music is more rock styled than it used to be, which suits me fine. All fourteen of the CD's songs were very good, and my least favorite was actually the first single, 'Get This Party Started.' <br />Track 1: One of the more pop flavored songs, it's lyrics are quite catchy and clever, really dealing with her identity. Overall, in a 5 star rating, I'd give it four.<br />Track 2: Though I feel this could have been named a bit better, as she sings about being a hazard to herself, I really really (etc etc) like this song, though it isn't all that...happy. It has an edge to it, the lyrics and the music both. I think most any teenager (my age group) could relate to the lyrics, though probably adults could as well. Five stars and more, really.<br />Track 3: Another favorite. And another I can relate too. Even more rock-ish than track two, she sings with feeling, as if she really felt the lyrics, which, for all I know, she might. To be warned: the chorus WILL get stuck in your head, but isn't that the sign of a good song? Five stars once more.<br />Track 4: Honestly, this is my least favorite song on the entire album. I don't think it really fits in with the rest of the CD and in fact, wasn't even written or co-written by Pink, as most others are. True, its lyrics are definately catchy, but it's a bit too much pop for me. Two stars I'd rate it, mostly because I find the song annoying.<br />Track 5: If your thinking Aretha Franklin or any other great soul singer of the mid-20th century, think again: it's pop-rap, and quite vain pop-rap. Talking of, well, obviously, respect from guys and expectations from them. This songdefinately needs more than one listening to so you somewhat like it, it's pretty good. Three stars I'd give.<br />Track 6: Wonderful! Not really much of anything genre-wise, probably rock really, this is another favorite, with Pink's strong voice singing about perseverance, is great. And for those wary of the 'f word', she doesn't actually say f***, just the sound of an F. Another five stars!<br />Track 7: Heh, lets see, this will be my fourth favorite. Really touchig, about worries of a split family and her parents fighting, this is another song of which Pink's voice really has feeling. Though sad, it is upbeat-ish, definately not slow, the lyrics are catchy. Five or more stars, once more.<br />Track 8: Not a favorite, but I do like this song. A ballad I suppose, it features Steven Tyler (of Aerosmith) crooning along, making a great duet, but definately Pink is the singer here. I at least found myself singing along more than once. Four stars I'd say.<br />Track 9: Though most people say they find meaning in this song, I don't. It's quite good, rock influenced I believe, and her voice is great, I just don't get a feeling from it. Four stars, though most would give it more.<br />Track 10: Another slower song, I do find meaning in this. Singing of people who are false-faced, just in it for their own reasons, Pink's voice has a bit of feeling. Not the best lyrics, not at all really, I'd give it three stars.<br />Track 11: Though I really don't like Linda Perry's voice, the song is really good, one of my favorites. Once again, I relate, though some people might not, to the lyrics, which deal with self-identity, and the confusion of it all, not really knowing who you are, and contemplating whether your life has really accomplished what you wanted it to, or if it will. Five stars, hands down.<br />Track 12: I don't really like this at all. Definatly rock, her voice isn't at it's best, and the lyrics are rather shallow. Three stars.<br />Track 13: Pretty good, not the best, it's lyrics are meaningful, and sad, talking of leaving death, crime, and other fun things behind to go to a place where things are supposed to be better, aka CA, better than Philidelphia. While her voice isn't being used to her full potential, like I said, the lyrics are good. Three stars or a bit more, I'd say.<br />Track 14: Last track, one of the best tracks. I really like this song, though I find no connection, as people are suggesting, to the WTC catastrophe. I relate to it in a way thinking of life and wanting acceptance, wanting to fix her past mistakes. The drum beats are a great touch (I think) and Pink's voice is clear and strong. Five stars at least.<br />Overall, great CD. Better than most. If you are really into pop music, and liked Get This Party Started only of all of her songs, you probably won't like this. To owners of past Pink CD, this one is quite different, and much better.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I got &quot;Rock Steady&quot; for Christmas. It think it is the best CD No Doubt has put out. For me, the best songs are &quot;Hella Good,&quot; &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Dective,&quot; but all the other songs are really good too. The only one I don't really like is &quot;Making Out&quot;...that song isn't the best, but this CD is definatly (i didn't spell that correctly) worth every cent you have to pay for it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Well, last year's at least.<br />I tend to get a tad wary of over-hyped bands and view them with careful suspicion before casting my usually unfavory -- and often well-founded -- vote.  <BR>Oasis?  Two thumbs down.  Radiohead?  Nah.  <br />Imagine my delightful surprise then to come across one such band which actually deserves the glowing reviews and all-around approving critical nodding and know-it-all chin stroking (No pun intended).  <br />The Strokes, however &amp; believe it or not, are that rare breed of a band.  They probably won't win a Grammy or two, but in my book they're all the better for it.<BR>They also may not be the most original sounding act around, but SONG POWER they got in abundance (which, contrary to popular belief, Oasis didn't have -- they just nicked other people's tunes), as well as that raw ROCK energy and freshness the likes of Radiohead can only dream about these days (Bring back &quot;The Bends&quot;!)  <BR>Oh well, the Strokes' wonderfully disrespectful youth just may have a little something to do with that.  Despise the cliches, but use them to your advantage when it suits you; the Spirit of Punk Rock lives!<br />The Music, you ask?  Well, there's nary a weak track herein -- they're merely unequally excellent.  From &quot;Is This It&quot; (the &quot;sleeper&quot;, opening title track) thru &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; (a closer so impressively electrifying most bands would place it much earlier on the disc), the balance and the way these songs belong to eachother and together is just such a rare treat in this &quot;Modern Age&quot; (Bring back &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;!)<BR>The album's length -- or shortness: 11 tracks in roughly 35 minutes -- also works perfectly.  My only beef with this particular issue here is the exclusion of &quot;New York Cops&quot;; a song vaguely reminiscent of Iggy Pop's (inferior) &quot;Lust For Life&quot;, perhaps understandably, replaced with the slightly weaker &quot;When it Started&quot; after the Sept.11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.  Also, for the prudish perhaps, this issue sports a new and different cover art.<br />But is this it?  Yes, I definitely think it is.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This was an excellent movie if you are fan of the action genre.  The dvd quality is amazing.  Video is crisp and you can almost feel the cars racing by you because of the digital sound.  I am not big into cars at all, but I still thought all the tricked out cars were very cool.  Highly recommended.
B00005R2BG|1.0|What is the big deal with this movie?!?  I've had more fun at the dentist.  I could only stand it for 30 minutes.  I knew it would be a musical- the music is ok.  But the story is not good, the camera shots are bizarre, and it is an overall annoying movie.  It was really out-there like a Clockwork Orange.   If this is supposed to be a great artistic movie, then I am happy with made-for television movies.
B00005JA2B|5.0|When this album was released in 1976, I was in my youthful heyday. It was one of the most popular albums getting airplay at the time &amp; when I went and got that 8-track (yes 8-track), I was further blown away. I remember driving my &quot;66&quot; Chevelle SS and cruising the streets of the small town I grew up in &amp; it was December 76 &amp; it began to snow........Cheyenne Anthem was playing and it seemed to just fit the moment.........and that memory of hearing that song as it began to snow was sort of inspiring I must say.<BR>        But to this day, this is one of my favorite KANSAS recordings. It is crystal clear with all the mixings done to a &quot;T&quot;. It really was their launching pad as far as national and worldwide acceptance was concerned. There isn't a song here that DOESN'T deserve to be listened to. They are all incredible and in my mind......timeless. I just wish they would have continued in this light and made LOTS more albums like this one. Granted... Audio Visions was their LAST go at being an original band without changes &amp; even by then you could tell changes were coming if you listened from &quot;KANSAS&quot; up to &quot;Audio Visions&quot;. It saddened me that such a musically talented, instumental, lyrical, and straight forward band of that time period, was going to change bandmembers and follow a different route when they had the RIGHT mixture all along!<br />      Yes.......this album to listen to even today is exquisit to the ear &amp; will be always......my reccomendation to all....<BR>buy it, put the headphones on, turn the lights low &amp; volume up! This is a timeless album that should get more airplay today than it does besides just &quot;Carry On ....&quot;!
B00005QATY|3.0|I refused to see this at the theater because I thought it would degrate Southerns. Once I saw it at a friend's house I changed my mind.  It's one of those movies  that you notice something new each time.  Now I enjoy it by myself because I don't want to admit to my boyfriend that I was wrong!
B0000009SG|5.0|What a band this was !  If you can handle the satire and the scatalogical lyrics, this album will please.  Remember that Frank used the latter to amplify the former.  This album is solid front to back, filled with classic tunes.  From Camarillo Brillo to Montana, we are repeatedly slapped in the face with reminders of how fickle the human condition is.  If you're not into that stuff, just check out the instrumental excellence - killer guitar solos by FZ and incredible violin solos by Jean Luc Ponty.  What a band.  Essential.
B00005U2LM|2.0|the production on this cd is terrible and so are most of the lyrics, even the dismal W was better then this sh*t
B0000009TT|5.0|Until the arrival of this CD, the only way to get Lather in it's entirety was to search far and wide for the LP box set that currently goes for 800 bucks, or try to find a copy from someone that had taped the radio broadcast back in the 70's.  Frank's legal battles with Warner Brothers were legendary, but so was his tenacity and focus.<br />It may have taken around 20 years, but Lather is now a commercial reality and although I don't want to say that it was worth the wait (I didn't - I searched out a vinyl copy) it is great that it's now available.  This is perhaps Frank's most fully realized work, adequately accessible, diverse and yet fully netted together as a complete package.  Certainly qualified as essential Zappa.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Americans make some of the best films in the world. They are however known for films which do not deal with real issues. Comedies, Action films and Romances are the sorts of things which generally come from American Cinema. <br />It was thus a surprise to see a film that dealt with a serious issue the war on drugs in a realistic and intelligent way.<br />Traffic is not preachy, it is fast paced and engaging despite using experimental techniques such as hand held cameras and processing the film for some scences in a bleached or non realistic way. <br />The issue with the drug was is that the margin on drug sales is such that drug runner can afford to lose half of their shipments and still make a profit. Detecting a high percentage of drug imports is close to impossible so that the long term price of drugs continues to fall and the purity rises. The film shows clearly the mechanics of the drug trade and why it is so difficult to stop.<br />Drug selling also makes huge amounts of money for suppliers. This gives them power especially in poorer countries and one of the films strengths is to show how easily the corruption can flow from the profits in the trade. <br />So many films show the drug war as a battle between some defined villians and Bruce Willis heroes. This film is able to convey a far greater sense of evil than any films of that type. A top notch film that mixes engrossing entertainment with an intelligent discussion of a real issue.
B0000009SY|5.0|This is an incredible work of art, but is no doubt far too aggressive for some listeners.  By this point in his career, Frank was totally fearless and in Joe's Garage, no punches were pulled.  Targets of his wit included organized religion, the government, touring musicians and their groupies, and the prison system.<br />For those willing to sit back and absorb the full impact of this album, the summed effect is impressive.  One can't in general listen to Zappa without thinking differently about music, but this suite of songs tend to be more synergistic than much of his work.  When \\"Watermellon in Easter Hay\\" talks about the last imaginary guitar solo, the bluesy guitar only cuts deeper.<br />Essential Zappa, excellent playing by the band, very good sound quality.  Not for most kids, not for some adults.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I watched this movie at a friend's house today. I am buying it tomorrow. The plot is essentially several layers of subplots that are intertwined, all culminating in the search for an 84 carat diamond. Most of it takes place in England, and thus there are some thick accents. There is a lot of profanity, almost every scene has at least one cuss word. There is also a lot of blood. Everywhere. Coming out of people's mouths, eyes, on the floor, on the ground, anywhere. Do not see this movie if such things offend you, because you will be offended like never before. However, it is a very good movie. Really. It has several memorable moments, a lot of black humor, and a lot of bodies. While there were a lot of characters, and most of their time in the movie is markedly brief, the coolest character is mickey, a \\"Piker\\", or gypsy, played by Brad Pitt. He is the very definition of badass. Perfect muscles, tatoos everywhere, and he can knock the living...out of anyone in a barefisted boxing fight. All in all, an excellent movie from Madonna's husband.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Totally awesome movie! I wish it was a bit longer, and had more scenes with alex in it, but other than that it was pretty great!
B00005R87Q|4.0|The Fast and the Furious is a well made fun ride with a familar plot and a weak ending but still it's really good. It's plot is sort of like Point Break with cars instead of surf boards. With Paul Walker as an undercover cop who gets close to the people that just might be the ones committing high way robbary from truck drivers. Walker has the cocky driver role down right but he doesn't look right as a cop to me, must be the pretty boy look. Vin Diesel is da man as usual the though, he has a real career ahead of him as either just an actor or a flat out kick ass action star. The Fast and Furious leaves you wanting more car chases and more action and I really hope we get more with a sequel.
B00005R2M3|5.0|How can one let this album slip out of their hands?! Laundry Service is a perfect example of a cultural fusion mixed with exotic sounds and pounding, emotional vocals! Wild-hearted works of lyrical art include songs such as the bouncy, tango-happy Objection, the oddly soothing, yet serious Poem To A Horse, and the beautiful, adoring ballads Underneath Your Clothes and The One. However, one mustn't shove aside the easily-craved, Arabic-influenced Eyes Like Yours (the English version of Ojos Asi), or Ready For The Good Times, which takes listeners back to the '80s, and coerces them to slip on legwarmers and headbands to get their grooves on. Fool tells us in an almost sarcastic but equally brilliant melody that the Latin diva has been hurt by the object of her affection, and on Rules, she lists her needs and necessities for a perfect relationship to a powerful, rigid tune. And of course, one must not forget the one that came straight from the Andes, an MTV favourite: Whenever, Wherever. The song is just as catchy as the video, and is unmatched by its ability to make the aficionados want to get up and move their hips!<br />Shakira's pronunciation of the English language is incredibly perfected, yet her Spanish tongue remains to keep the Colombian's flavour alive. In fact, four songs on the album are in her native tongue, including Whenever, Wherever's alternative Suerte, the Asian-inflected Que Me Quedes Tu, the poppy, addicting Te Dejo Madrid, and Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Objection's counterpart). This album is a definite buy, and anyone who is able: I highly recommend purchasing it as quickly as possible. But you know...<br />...It's not her fault that she's so irresistible!<br />Or is it?
0385506244|4.0|When I finished Skipping Christmas I was startled that this book was written by one of America's foremost &quot;popular&quot; fiction authors and yet not a single review I have read has alluded to its subsurface meaning. It reminded of another &quot;popular&quot; fiction author from over a century ago, Mark Twain. When Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn I'm not sure how long it was before people began to decipher its true meaning. Grisham has made a distinct, acerbic attack at popular American &quot;Christmas&quot; culture. Its protagonist, the residents on Hemlock (Socrates anyone?) Street, and the people of the District demonstrate a truly blind religious hypocrisy that is not resolved at the novel's so-called conclusion. I have no idea if Grisham did this on purpose- but if he did than I'm sure he's having the last laugh right now.
B00003CXTG|3.0|If it had been made by Stephen Spielberg or Ridley Scott, this could have been one of the best war films of all time.  Instead it was made by two people who think 30 minutes of fire on a few ships and 2 and half hours of love story makes a good war movie.  It was still an OK movie.  As for the DVD, what's with switching discs half way through?  Sure, put the special features on a different disk, but at least keep the entire movie on one.
B00005U122|5.0|I was waiting for this one ever since I saw on the Roger Waters website that they were going to release the show on DVD.  I went to two of the shows (Detroit and Grand Rapids, MI) when he toured in 1999 and then I went to one of the shows (Chicago) on the 2000 tour and I have to say this DVD is a pretty impression of the concert.  The audio on it is phenomanal.  I was amazed at how close they came to the effect of Dogs live. I wish Amazon had more stars for this one.  Now, when is Roger going to release a DVD of the Radio KAOS tour?
B00003CXTF|1.0|A tale filled with mellodramatic love scenes and horrible acting is not my idea of a night at the movies.  The movie is filled with corny tearjerkers and portrays little of the actual historical value of Pearl Harbor.  Ben Affleck gives one of his worse performances as a man, who, if this movie had any basis in reality would have died in aplane crash.  His monotone, undeveloped charecter does little to boost the already pitiful movie.  The only reason I gave this movie one star is because of Josh Hartnet, who is not only gorgeous, but also a blossoming actor.

B00005JKOV|5.0|Waking Life was so interesting because it brought so many ideas and ways of thinking into one movie that kept you entertained with stunning animation and interesting characters. This movie really has a message, it has tons of them. It's a great break from regular movies. I absolutely loved this movie, definitely worth buying.
6304806426|1.0|Another lost sale. I simply don't understand why this film is being re-released without a Director's Commentary. Anthony Minghella had the time and inclination to annotate Truly Madly Deeply. So much for the notion that  Miramax is more interested in quality than more mainstream studios.
0385505833|4.0|Dear Readers<br />This book is some what different than other from John Grisham. It has that Christmas spirit of having family around and than gone to thier jobs the next day. Its a wonderful read with the familiar characters in Mr. Grisham's Book. It's  a nice read on a plane ride or gift for that law student or college student who loves to read. I'm a middle school teacher, and love history, but i read my book during our final days before school let out for the holidays. One day, one of my student made a comment and asked me why i was always reading. I told her that i was trying to get into the christmas spirit. But sir&quot; Your reading a book entitled Skipping Christmas&quot; I know that what makes it so fun? Enjoy.<br />Ray Contreras
B000002NZO|3.0|Trespass is Genesis' second album and it marked a nice move forward for the band from their poor debut From Genesis to Revelation.  The album contains six lengthy prog-rock numbers that contain the typical mystical lyrics, as Peter Gabriel hadn't yet hit his stride.  The music is superb though as the band really tightened up their sound.  &quot;The Knife&quot; is the best track on the album and is one their best from the Peter Gabriel era.  This album isn't an essential Genesis album, but makes for interesting listening to see the progress of the band through the decade.

B00000IOSU|3.0|I really love Sara McLachlan's voice. It is beautiful.  You can feel her passion for the song when she sings.  I bought this CD and was shocked when a few of the songs had objectional words in them.  Yes, it is stuff you hear everyday at work and school but I don't want to pay money to hear them.  I skip over the tracks rather than listen to them, but it shouldn't have to be that way.  Couldn't she have just chosen some other words?
B00005QZ7U|1.0|A daring film that ultimately fails miserably.  It is painful to watch only partly due to Kidman's lack of musical talent.  There are no reedeming qualities.  The editing will give you headaches.  The side plots are like nightmares.  The movie tries too hard to establish itself as the next Rocky Horror Picture Show or Priscilla Queen of the Desert at the cost of quality.  Don't just turn away from this film, run away and fast!!!!
B00005N9CV|5.0|I am urged to write a review in response to fellow writers who it seems miss the point. These are standard tunes song as only Krall can. Her voice is unique, her interpretations are unique as well. The orchestration is lush and sensitive and with great beat on the bossa nova style renditions.<BR>I have played Besame Mucho on a Latin Jazz and Son Radio Program. The publics' response is enthusiastic. The pronuntiation is totaly irrelevant. She is not a Spanish teacher but a singer that conveys the magnifecent bolero feeling. I have seen her in person: What a beauty and charismatic performer she is. Her dress is most welcome. I recommend this albun highly, it will grow on you as good music always does.
B00004Z511|4.0|I've already reviewed the standard pressing of Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot;, but I thought that I would add a few words about the Limited Edition. I used to own the default packaging of this album, but sold it to a friend so that I could experience the Limited Edition, something I thought that I should own after &quot;Kid A&quot; became one of my favorite albums of all time. First things first--the only difference between this version and the standard version is the album art and packaging--there are no bonus tracks, no digital remastery, none of that &quot;technical stuff&quot;. The packaging is a derivative of the default LP gatefold (something I love for a compact disc) minus the jewel case, except it's much larger--not as large as the &quot;Amnesiac&quot; LE cover, but large enough to keep it out of a standard CD holder. Translation: you're going to have to keep this on a bookshelf or something, and there are many people (myself included) who find that incredibly annoying and inconvenient. As far as the art is concerned, you do get new paintings, and they are of course very lovely. You also receive a short-and-sweet poem about &quot;Nothing&quot; in this version, something not included in the other pressing. The CD is kept in a sleeve on the final &quot;page&quot; of the booklet, and opposite this page is a list of notable examples of &quot;ice melt around the world&quot;. It lists glaciers and other large icy structures which have been melting over the course of the past few years--I guess that this is sort of interesting.<br />And that's it.<br />The long, tall, and short of it is this--I really only recommend that you dish out the extra ten bucks for this record if you're obsessive-compulsive about collectors' editions. There is an extensive amount of lovely artwork from the standard pressing that is NOT included in this Limited Edition, and it's very sorely missed. Personally, I bought the Limited Edition because it looked cool and I thought that there would be some great album art, and there is--but I do not like the way that so much great stuff from the standard release is omitted entirely. To be perfectly honest, I like the art from the standard release more than that which came with this one, and there's actually more of it! <br />I would take the time to quote my review of the musical content of this record here, but I think that my colleagues do a more than ample job of saying what a perfect sonic masterpiece this album represents. And it really doesn't matter anyway, because if you haven't bought this album yet, you really need to head on over and grab the standard copy of this CD (with the computer mountains on the cover). I really wish that I could give the Limited Edition a rating of 3 1/2, but I think that a 4 rating is accurate enough. Once more--you SHOULD really own a copy of &quot;Kid A&quot; because it's a tremendous record. However, you SHOULDN'T be paying extra for this edition unless you're insanely attracted to &quot;gold editions&quot; like this. That's simply because the only difference is album art and packaging, and in that department the standard pressing is the unquestionable winner anyway.

6300213668|5.0|Grease is by far the best musical I have ever seen, I first saw it when I was about 10 and I agree with another women that I didn't realy understand the sexual innuendo that is brought across in the film e.g the scene with Kenicki and Rizzo in the back of his car. I saw this 5 years ago and only been in the last year or so I have fully understood it. It is definitely a brillient timeless classic, John Travolta is on top form, he is just brillient!

0571212689|5.0|Richard Williams is a man who is largely responsible for the revival of the art of animation in the early 1970s. Williams had Disney animator Art Babbitt and Warner great Ken Harris working in his studio in London and training a new generation of animators in the techniques of good character animation, which was not taught at the time in any school or considered an art form.<br />Williams' long awaited book on animation technique is the logical successor to Preston Blair's CARTOON ANIMATION and it successfully updates some of the weaknesses of that book, particularly in handling dialogue animation. He covers a lot of the same ground that Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston did in their now out-of-print THE ILLUSION OF LIFE.<br />There is some history, but that's available in other books. What is unique about this book is that Williams writes how surprised he, an Academy Award winning animator with a successful professional studio, was to learn that he needed to learn just about everything over again from Harris and Babbitt. Fortunately for us he is now sharing these priceless lessons with the public.<br /> The most important thing that an aspiring animator will get from this book is: that animation IS an art form, and good animation has nothing to do with whether it is done on computer or on paper.  Williams exhorts his readers to 'draw whenever possible' and even though there is a computer modelled figure on the cover of the book, there is not a single piece of computer generated imagery in it. The book is about the bare bones, about creating life in art. Animation is the twentieth century's contribution to world art and deserves to be taken very seriously.<br />Buy this book.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Any film that is as simple as the line \\"The Meaning of Life is Just to Love and Be Loved in Return\\" automatically gets credit.  I suspected I was going to be a terribly big sucker for this Baz Luhrmann film, and Christ was I ever.  You might remember Luhrmann's other films, the 1996 stylistic update of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and the early nineties charmer \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" both of which were artistically wonderful to watch.  \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" however, is a whole different ballgame.  One thing that is important to understand before going to this film is that it is a musical - and it adds a bit more camp to his repertoire than any of his earlier works.  Some of the less romantically-inclined members of the audience who were sitting right behind me were not privy to this information - and thus were not the happiest campers in the theater.  None the less, even a few heartless bastards could not ruin this electric film.  <br />The film uses a myriad of different songs - some are original, but most are revamped pop songs.  What makes these songs work in the context of a movie musical is how Luhrmann arranges them, and splices them into his visually stunning backdrop.  To give you an example of what you can expect:  when we are first introduced to the Moulin Rouge (which is a nineteenth century French brothel/night club) Luhrmann mixes \\"Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend\\" with both \\"Miss Marmalade\\" and Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"  This is all happening as Nicole Kidman is swinging high above a cast of hundreds of lavishly-dressed men and women. Glitter is falling from the sky, there are more colors leaping from the screen then you can shake a stick at, and the camera seems to be doing things that no camera should be able to do.  It really is challenging just to catch your breath in moments like these, and this is just the beginning of the film.  <br />The story is simple but endearing - a writer (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge (Nicole Kidman.)  Not all is rosy in la-la land, however, because Kidman's character has been promised to the Duke who funds the Moulin Rouge. The Moulin Rouge, of course, just happens to hold the dreams of many of the characters - including both Kidman and McGregor.  A moderately predictable but tremendously enjoyable romp ensues, giving the audience the right amounts of laughter and tears to fill their dreams for at least the next week.<br />McGregor and Kidman light up the screen with their surprisingly good voices and their undeniable chemistry.  When he would turn to her and sing, and you watched her face light up, it was as if you could actually see them falling in love.  It was this passion that breathed life into the rather clichéd storyline.  <br />The other \\"undeniable\\" in this picture was the truly visionary style of Baz Luhrmann.  The world that he creates in \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is something that I have never seen before - and it really left me awestruck.  From the costumes to the special effects shots, everything in this film fits the world Luhrmann creates for his 1890's Paris backdrop perfectly.  Dipping sometimes into the surreal, and then other times into post modern, Luhrmann finds a way to use many styles in a seamless marriage of visual and sonic genius.  Every aspect of this film dances - and it is all you can do not to dance with it.  <br />thehighchair.net

6300274195|4.0|The first time I came into contact with DUMBO (1941) was in Steven Spielberg's &quot;1941&quot;, where a macho general (Robert Stack) is watching the &quot;Baby Mine&quot; scene.  He starts to shead tears, and the audience uproars with laughter.  When I rented the 50th anniversary edition, I knew why the general cried.  I did the same, and then I started laughing, too.  <br />Here is a movie for all ages.  It hasn't dated over the years, which makes it perfect.  The message is clear - inner strength, friendship, and love conquers all.  The &quot;Pink Elephants&quot; and &quot;Baby Mine&quot; scenes are still classics.  The most touching scene in movie history, of course, is when Jumbo Jr. sees his mother in jail, and the song, &quot;Baby Mine&quot;, is played. <br />Although FANTASIA, SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, and LION KING are much better animated films from Disney, DUMBO tugs more at the heart.<br />Score: 80 (out of 100)

0684867621|3.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a brave attempt by Stephen King to scare us, and yet touch us, with his harrowing portrayal of a little 9 year old girl who gets lost in the woods.  Although he succeeds to some point (Trisha McFarland is a very compelling character) the novel falls short.  We really never feel that Trisha is in any sense of danger, and that takes a little away from the suspense of the novel, and what King is trying to do.  However, he is, after all, trying to tell a story, a routine one at that, but with a little bit of a twist.  The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon isn't King's worst novel of which I have read (Misery) but it also isn't his best work and skill of writing.  Disappointing, but I think we can forgive Mr. King.
B000024D4R|5.0|&quot;Animals&quot; is a great album from start to finish.  Musically it is epic, lyrically it is brilliant.  The theme of the album is more or less directly taken from the famous book &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, but its what is done with that theme that is the best part.<br />&quot;Pigs on the wing&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2 (the opening and closing acoustic ballads) are pretty much about caring for one another, looking out for each other from the &quot;pigs on the wing&quot;.<br />&quot;Dogs&quot; is a hard-hitting song about people who use other people, those who when given the chance will &quot;stick the knife in&quot;, and use anyone as long as it helps them.  Dave Gilmour simply cooks on his guitar, with the fantastic acoustic chord work used at the start, the 3 dueling electric guitars in the mid-section, to the blistering solo.  One of their best songs ever written.<br />&quot;Pigs (three different ones)&quot; is a mid-tempo, more keyboard driven song, that is reminicent of the song &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; from &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.  Essentially it attacks heartless, facist, capitalists (try saying that three times fast), who are only want more and more power.  But as Waters puts so well &quot;ha ha, charade you a-ha&quot; - basically these people are only important to themselves and others like them.<br />&quot;Sheep&quot; is somewhat of a mixed bag.  It starts off with the bleeting of sheep, with some laid back keyboard work by Rick Wright.  Then the rest of the band kick in, and eventually they start rocking off.  The best part of the song is the way the first verse vocals trail off, carried away by a weird synth effect.  The lyrics, however, are a tad predictable, and the mocking of the Lord's prayer is pretty awful, but the music is great and again Gilmour's guitar work is awesome (esp. at the ending).<br />Some say this album is underrated, but with given the subject matter, it is hardly a suprise that this wasn't a huge (by Pink Floyd standards anyway) seller.  It's probably not for the faint of heart, or for those who are new to the band.  However, don't let that put you off, as this is one of their best albums.
B0000041Z5|5.0|No wonder Brahms was shy about his symphonies, being the consummate Beethoven fan.  His reluctance to intro them has been well received since, and I marveled at the richness, character, and subtle, pastoral strength of these four efforts.<br />The Second currently is my favorite, with its serenity and rich reflectiveness.  The tuba addition strengthens the bass lines and adds the depth which this excellent Decca recording does justice too.  The conductor is apt at its skillful scoring and counterpoints.<br />Marvelous set for the quality and at an amazing price.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Walt Disney's highly ambitious venture into the marriage of animation and classical music is part acid-trip, and part experimental indie-film (long before either term was coined). Though flawed with a questionable format echoing a concert presentation and often tedious narrative by Deems Taylor, this often misunderstood film truly shines in DVD format as the crown jewel in the crown of the golden age of animation. Watching with commentary by John Canemaker, Roy Disney, and James Levine provides for a new 'insider' understanding of the film as well as placing each selection within historical context in regards of what was happening in art, film, culture, and music at the time. There is also a seperate commentary of quips from Walt Disney compiled by Canemaker which, while a good idea to put in such a feature, seems a little too patched together. The 'Making of' Featurette provides little new produciton material or drawings outside of what already exists in books and other similar 'making of' films but is interesting nonetheless. The film itself never looked better. Each stipple of drybrush and airbrush reads clearly and the often bold, crisp lines of the cel animation are like no other previous version. The sound, while muffled at times by the 'Fantasound' development of the studio in the late 1930's is the most pristine version of the recording that I have heard. With the additional Deems footage, and the inclusion an actual intermission, it would seem that this is THE version of Fantasia. Get your frame-by-frame button ready.<BR><br />An interesting footnote: Although the box reads \\"Uncut\\", it is apparent in the Pastoral sequence that some editing was done in the sequence where the \\"Centaurettes\\" parade for their suitors. This is due to the appearance of a stereotypical pickaninny female Centaur who tends to the others. In one scene in particular as Bacchus struggles up some stairs, it seems as though she was digitally removed altogether having seen the film beforewhen the same scene was tightly cropped. Whether the elimination of the character by the current studio is sensativity to Black audiences or over-political correctness and a white-washing of history is for the viewer to decide.
157453470X|3.0|Buyer beware! The audio version of this book, formerly prominently advertised as UNABRIDGED, is nothing of the sort. It consists of what the box calls \\"Unabridged Excerpts\\" (an oxymoron if I ever heard one), pasted together by frequent summaries of intervening plot developments. If the experience of listening to the whole long, intricately developed novel is what you're looking for, the abridgement is not for you. Be sure you know what you're buying.
0783225725|4.0|Tale of mysterious stranger who rides into town to avenge past sins of mini-boom town located in isolated california of the old american West.<br />One liners, desolate locale and an impending finale, add up to a fast paced film.  A bit satirical at times, Clint's almost supernatural confidence in the face of the townsfolk's complete (almost) hostility is simply fun to watch.  <br />I personally liked the scene where Clint handed the Indian kids 2 huge bottles of candy, it was hilarious!<br />Get ready for the avenging angel, delivering a personal message from the Master himself, to those who killed his charge.<br />great movie!

6305177473|2.0|The &quot;original&quot; of this film was not the 1961 film made by Walt Disney but a German film made in 1950 called &quot;Das doppelte Lottchen&quot; based on the novel of the same name by Erich Kstner. I recommend that American viewers try to get hold of the superior original version.
0385486804|4.0|I thought this story portrayed the emotions and opinions of the main character Christopher McCandless.  The author, Jon Krakauer, did a wonderful job showing Chris' frustration with his family and his need to be spontaneous.  Krakauer shows how McCandless felt that the typical lifestyle of most of us is just not sufficiently adventurous.  Krakauer demonstrated the way these &quot;hitch hikers&quot; or &quot;tramps&quot; feel by interupting McCandless's story with excerpts from other people that did similar things to what McCandless did.  The excerpts helped reflect why some people desire to live a life of adventure and nature even if it means an unnecessary, painful death.  Jon Krakauer does an excellent job of getting the reader into the mind of Christopher McCandless.

0060934913|5.0|Fascinating and horrifying, Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is actually mostly entertaining. In this autobiographical work, Bourdain recounts seminal experiences in his career as a chef, all the way from an inadequate newbie line cook at a sea shanty restaurant to helping open Les Halles in Tokyo. The hardest part I found in reading this book, was dealing with my judgments of him and the industry at large as he paints it. He is clear from the beginning that (a) his book was only intended for others in the industry and (b) the industry, in his experience, is comprised of antisocial misfits.<br />The experiences he describes here as having molded his personality, and which continue to mold his kitchens, make the book so amusing and both his individual character and the restaurant business at large so difficult to swallow. Fortunately, he does present, in a very well written chapter, a counterpoint description of a fellow, yet civilized, chef's kitchen and restaurant.<br />If your the least bit interested or experienced in restaurant dining, this is a must read: an insider's narrative of a world most of us only visit for a few hours at a time.

This video is not available in the UK with PAL, but as most newer vids in the UK claim to run NTSC, it is now within the grasp of all those of us who have hungered for a copy of the movie, but were unable to see it.<br />There's a half-hour documentary at the beginning, my only grouse is that I would have rather it was at the end, so the film was where I want it.<br />The film itself is just beautiful. The music is beautiful. And, yes - even the orchestra is beautiful!!<br />What can I say? The film should be compulsory viewing for all children? It charts the progress of Hitler's Germany in a way that is totally understandable. The horror that exists is visible, but it doesn't horrify, it works your emotions over.<br />If you've never seen it - you've not lived yet!

Seeing through King Shrewd's eyes, he witnesses the Forging of the town of Siltbay, where lives his childhood friend Molly, whom he's secretly always been in love with. Has Molly been Forged too, is she dead, or alive but in great danger? He has to find out.<br />In Buckkeep, Prince Regal's ambition is soaring, and he will gain access to the throne of the Six Duchies by all means. And King-in-wainting Verity is too busy Skilling in his tower to protect the kingdom from the Forging raids of the Red Ships, and the old king's strength is slowly leaving him. Even with the help Verity's new Queen-in-waiting Kettricken, who decides to take up arms and attack the Raiders, and Fitz's new Bond with a wolf cub, the situation grows more and more hopeless.<br />In this middle volume, unexpected alliances are forged and treacheries unmasked. With the pressure of Regal's treasons building up, the story becomes richer and steadily gathers momentum, and I was compelled to keep turning the pages.
B000002UDB|3.0|When I first heard this album in my teens, it struck me as thoroughly forgettable. My opinion hasn't changed one iota 30 years later. <br />Yes, there are some high spots...&quot;Penny Lane,&quot; for example, is as lyrical as anything the Fab Four have ever written. But anyone who thinks &quot;I Am the Walrus,&quot; &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; or the title track even approach being a good musical effort hasn't been paying attention. <br />While the effort shows some imagination, the fact remains that MMT lacks the cohesiveness of either of its predecessors, &quot;Sergeant Pepper&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;; leading one to the conclusion that they've spent too much time taking acid and prancing around with flower children. Although I also spent a fair share of my youth engaged in &quot;consciousness expansion,&quot; it is NO ACCIDENT that the Beatles quickly grew disenchanted with all that, and for the most part put both the Maharishi and psychedelia behind them in their later albums.<br />All told, a thoroughly forgettable album that would have gotten almost no airplay if ANY other group had written the songs. I give it three stars only in deference to the two departed band members.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore's score for this wonderful movie is a breath of fresh air.  Or Eyre.  Hey, I didn't know Hobbiton was in Ireland!  But I digress.  What you won't find here is bombast and re-hashed themes from other movies.  Shore has succeeded in creating music which accentuates the action without drowning it out.  The leitmotifs of the hobbits, the Fellowship and the Ring are well crafted and used to excellent effect.  Even at the end, when all roads lead into Shadow, the music reminds us that Frodo and Sam carry Hobbiton with them and that their friendship will light them on their way.<br />This is not the best score ever written and there is no one piece that stands out, such as we have heard in early John Williams scores.  Nevertheless, this is a beautiful score suited to a beautiful movie.  Can we ask for any more than this?
B00005IBGQ|3.0|If you like his vocals, this album is stellar.  The craftsmanship, lyrics, and musical composition on this album are superb.  Unfortunately, I *still* cannot stomach his whiney, gnatty voice.  What a pity for me.  This guy is SO talented.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|If there is one thing Prince certainly can still do, and has done, is produce million-selling albums and singles.  One must not assume that this is Prince's goal right now.  The Rainbow Children is an intensely personal art work of self enlightment, fantasy, good will, and intellectual curiousity.  Artists have the right to express themselves personally.  It's sad that so many listeners find his lyrics on this album to be racist, offensive, sexist, and in-your-face religion pushing.  Quite the opposite.  This album is about unity, inner peace, racial harmony, and diversity.  He does address some of the racial atrocities that have occurred in history.  Nonetheless, respect his opinions people.<br />  Musically, the extensive title track sounds like  a Miles Davis-ish jazz track with some impessive guitar work at the end.  Some people may find the deep voices out-of-place, but they bring unity to the tracks as a cohesive work of art.  As others have noted, this is an album to hear in its entirity in sequential order.  &quot;She Loves Me for Me&quot; is a gorgeuos, elegant, radio-friendly ballad of earthy love.  &quot;The Work Pt. 1&quot; should have James Brown in awe.  &quot;Everywhere&quot; is fine, uplifting gospel.  &quot;Mellow&quot; will make your sofa melt as your order up your second martini.  &quot;Last December&quot; is my favorite track on the album.  It weeps, aspires, rises, and comes to a satisfying grande finale.<br />Buy this album.  Listen to it repeatedly with an open mind by yourself.  It's purely a journey.  Don't just pop this album in, think it's weird, and ditch it folks.  Prince answers to no one, not even album standards.  He is an original.  This album will go down in musical history.  It may take time for this to come to realization for many listeners.
6304602979|5.0|This movie is a real mix of action, romance and comedy but I think the key to it are some of the great cameos by people like Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and Val Kilmer.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone ! 5 stars !
B00005QZ7U|5.0|My reaction to the first 15 minutes of this film was, \\"Oh, no.  This is going to be a two hour music video, and from the looks of it, it is going to be like MTV on LSD.\\"  I actually shut it off and went to bed.  I returned the next day and vowed to keep my personal policy never to leave any movie unfinished, no matter how much I dislike it.  I'm glad I have that policy because wow, was my first impression wrong.<br />Baz Luhrmann has delivered us a piece of filmmaking genius with this avant-garde film.  It combines disparate elements that seem incompatible, yet they work magnificently together.  Music video style is combined with the moorings of the traditional theatrical musical to create a piece that is simultaneously revolutionary and old guard.<br />This film is about incongruity.  Modern popular music is woven into a turn of the century story.  The sets, lighting and costumes are designed to create garish color clashes.  The presentation is sometimes camp comedy and at others very straightforward and melodramatic.  Normally, none of these elements work together, but Luhrmann orchestrates them into a symphony of visual and auditory harmony that is nothing short of overwhelming.<br />The story itself is nothing special.  It is an old fashioned tragic love story where true love is pitted against practical realities.  The impoverished writer (Ewan McGregor) loves the courtesan (Nicole Kidman) and she loves him, but the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) desires her and will stop at nothing to get her.  She promises to be with the Duke, and he agrees to fund the \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", refurbishing the Moulin Rouge for the event and promising to make her a great star.  She agrees but continues to dally with the writer behind the Duke's back.  Of course, this leads to a confrontation where she must decide between true love and great wealth.<br />The music is outstanding.  The arrangements of familiar pop songs as well as the original music are fantastically done.  The danceand choreography are Broadway quality.  The costumes and sets are, well, Spectacular.  The presentation is sometimes zany and at other times solemn, but always entertaining.  While Luhrmann may not have redefined the movie musical, he has certainly expanded its limits by a couple of galaxies.  In many ways it reminds me of the kind of effect shows like \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and \\"The Wiz\\" had on theater, taking risks to go to irreverent places and traverse unspoken boundaries.<br />The acting is terrific.  Ewan McGregor continues to expand his considerable acting talents into new and varied areas, and with each new project shows his adaptability and facility.  In addition to giving a gut wrenching performance as the forlorn writer he also shows a reasonably good singing voice.  However, as good as McGregor is, he is blown off the set by Nicole Kidman.  Kidman astounds with powerful vocals of recording artist caliber that literally raise goose flesh.  Her acting is multi-textured with amazing range, handling the comedy, the romance and the tragedy with equal aplomb.  This is by far her best performance and her shining moment.  Jim Broadbent is phenomenal as the over-the-top owner and ringmaster of the legendary night spot.  The entire cast (especially the dancers) delivers a high energy performance.<br />This film is a treat for anyone who loves theater, popular music, great dance and an old fashioned love story.  I rated it a 10/10.  Yes, it is sappy and silly and overly melodramatic, but it is done with style . . . Spectacularly!
B000002LE6|4.0|In case you don't know, all the songs are on ONE track. That's fine if you have 45 minutes to sit down for a &quot;spiritual&quot; experience, but what if you just want to load up the CD changer and shuffle your Prince CDs? You'll have to leave this one out. What if you just want to hear Dance On? It's a good CD other than being on one track.

B00005R87Q|4.0|The cars are fast.  The cinematography accents the film perfectly and gets the blood pumping even faster.  No, it's not the best movie and no the acting isn't top-notch, but Vin Diesel makes the film more than worth watching.  Sometimes movies are made for pure enjoyment and to get the viewer excited.  This is one of those films.  Sit back relax and avoid caffeine, because once the movie starts your heart won't need anything else.  I also recommend that you stay home after watching the film.  Watching this movie almost triples your chance of getting a speeding ticket.

B000002NE4|5.0|If any of you out there know about Nick Cave, you know him either for his frenetic, psychotically energetic lyrical violence (he can be a whirling dynamo onstage, spewing forth anger and hate and exposing the rotten underbelly of emotional intensity), or his subdued, profoundly raw emotion (he can sing a sad, gentle love song better than anyone on the planet).<br />&quot;The Boatman's Call&quot; is a superb collection of love songs. Simple melodies mix with dramatic instrumentation and perfectly-chosen lyrics to expound on emotion that many, many people never experience themselves. There is a power in Cave's words. There is a spirit, a soul, in his melodies. His music is alive and breathing.<br />Some gems on the album:<br />&quot;Lime Tree Arbour&quot; - A simple love ballad with haunting melody and wondrous lyrics.<br />&quot;People Ain't No Good&quot; - Slow, drifting and misanthropic. One of the best Cave songs out there.<br />&quot;Brompton Oratory&quot; - Lyrics are rich in imagery and force a mental picture of the scene described. The complex lyric-melody interaction and religious tone make this a personal favorite.<br />&quot;Black Hair&quot; - Melodic minimalism near its best, this one portrays an obsessiveness that's seldom encountered. The accordion seems to 'breathe' through the song, which drew me closer to the melody, made me consider the song in the first person. Close your eyes listening to this and imagine...it's not simply trivial and pointless to write a song about hair. It's got a lot to show you if you're willing to play along.<br />And once you've listened to this CD, once you think you've figured it out, check out Cave's lecture on &quot;The Secret Life of the Love Song&quot; and then listen to The Boatman's Call again. This allows you to place all of his songs in context, to realize the meaning behind their form.  Once you understand Cave's views on life, the world, people and God, you become wrapped in his genius. His world invades your own and grabs hold, sinking its beautiful but deadly claws into your very consciousness. This, friends, is not music meant to be taken lightly. This is power, pure genius and unadulterated passion.and grabs hold, sinking its beautiful but deadly claws into your very consciousness. This, friends, is not music meant to be taken lightly.

B00000K19E|5.0|A lot of people these days are complaining that the movie industry is falling into a technological rut and that real movies have ceased to exist.  I say that if the graphics and technology used in films has my jaw on the floor like this one did then who cares.  This film was amazing.  The end kind of stunk but I'm not much for the sappy stuff.  I don't even like Keanu Reeves and I can watch this movie every day
B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead.&quot; That's the first line of this film, and sets the tone. But first let me tell you about the DVD.<br />Great DVD! LOTS of features. There are 2 CDs and the second one is purely bonus features. I haven't been through all of them yet. One of my faves is the ongoing commentary from either the production designer, director, writer, or cinematographer, you can turn on while watching the film; and the multicamera angle and uncut dance sequences. This is a milestone in DVD making. It's loaded.<br />As for the film, this is a better movie than I imagined. It sells itself as a colorful drama, but it's a musical through and through. It's officially a TragiComiDramaMusical, or that's what the critics call it, but it gets to your heartstrings and senses and kicks them.<br />Baz Luhrmann had a theory for this film, that music and razzle dazzle and color will create a heightened experience, and it worked. People may pay more attention to it for it's astounding technical abilities, but I was mainly captivated by it's music, acting, and it's storyline. Not to say I didn't like the color and razor sharp editing, quite the contrary. I was purely amazed at what they achieved. But that they could go over that and send a clear cut and emotional story with superb acting, is something you rarely see in any &quot;super charged&quot; films.<br />The story is loosely based on the Greek Tragedy about Orhpeus. It revolves around the young Christian (Ewan McGregor) who enters the world of the Moulin Rouge and Montmarte to become a great writer. He befriends some strange Bohemians and is assigned to write a show for the MR called &quot;Spectacular! Spectacular!&quot;. He has to recruit the courtesan Satine, but falls in love with her. Eventually they both become enmeshed in their love for each other, the dirty and treacherous goings on of the MR, and the making of the show. After betrayal and intrigue, the film ends with a tragic ending you knew was coming from Christian's first line: &quot;This story is about love...the woman I loved is.....dead.&quot;<br />The acting is much better than I expected. People had been talking about how Kidman could get a Oscar nomination for her performance in this, but I had thought &quot;Why? It's a musical. There's no such thing as good acting in musicals.&quot; Nicole shines. She goes through several stages in the film and is always believable at the level she chooses. Especially in her TB scenes, where she plays sick, she does a very unglamorous and ugly portrayal of the disease. She does comedy and seduction and heroism in one role, and it's not at all cliche. McGregor particularly surprised me. I had known he was a good actor, but not as good as he is in this film. He also goes through stages, and pulls it off with his ability to act completly natural. He's by far one of the best natural actors I've ever seen, and some of his body language and facial gestures do the role a great deal of good. It's hard to act &quot;innocent&quot; without getting terribly annoying, and he's never annoying, but maybe because he's more of a decent and kind character than the stereotypical &quot;innocent&quot;. Supporting characters shine, and John Leguizamo deserves a thumbs up for a particularly painful but strong performance (if you hear how they shortened him). Jim Broadbent, who plays the enabling and sweet pimp Zidler (it's tough to call him that, but that's what he is), is fantastic, and Richard Roxborough who plays the Duke, is notorious and does a wonderful job at being completely and one hundred percent devious.<br />This movie shines, and it addicts you. Many people have said you either love it or hate it, and I'd say it's true. It will either overwhelm you, or you'll like it for all it is. It's supposed to be overboard. It's supposed to have that &quot;If it exists we'll use it just because.&quot; That's the whole point. It's a beautiful film, and it's very true, it follows how life works. There are people who'll be bad to you, and people who will love you, and not everything works as you want it. It's supposed to be an experience, not just a date at the movies.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film but am always willing to give Angelina Jolie a chance.  No the film wasn't great but it was a heck of a lot better than I expected.  The cinematography and action scenes were original and interesting.  The site locations for the movie were beautiful and different.  The acting was pretty good.  If you are having trouble figuring out what to watch, check this out.  It's not great, but it's far from bad.  I think you'll be surprised.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I heard a lot of good things about this album. Honestly, I'm very disappointed: it's bland, boring, lacks energy.<BR>I wouldn't recommend this album if you want to hear &quot;something different&quot; in the current rock'n'roll production. Go check White Stripes instead: garage sound, tons of tunes, amazing stuff.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I almost didn't write a review for this because I have yet to meet a person that has not seen the movie.  This film is genuinely funny.  The humor is perfect for kids and adults.  The adult humor is just far enough over kids heads that they won't get it.  This makes the film that much more enjoyable for adults because they are finally getting one over on the kids.  The graphics are amazing.  The plot is great, the music is great.  If you enjoy cartoons or have kids don't bother renting the movie, just buy it.  This is a top-notch film that you can enjoy over and over again.
B00000DGUG|4.0|In 1995, Alanis dropped jaws and emptied wallets with her mega-selling, mega-menace Jagged Little Pill; an album filled with beautiful ballads and done-me-wrong-anthems. But during introspection in India, the singer seems to have gotten that chip off her shoulder. She hasnt totally gone soft on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. The album is quiet and composed in some places, raising the roof in others. The first single &quot;Thank You&quot; is an ode to all things that made Alanis happy as a clam, and its an okay song; but we couldve done without the video. Jagged's edge pops up every once in awhile, in such songs as &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot;, &quot;I Was Hoping&quot;, and &quot;Joining You&quot;, which all pretty much have different stories and messages behind them. Love, Lost love, and on the pro-therapy tune &quot;The Couch&quot;, the its-ok-if-you-have-problems-message. Love Letters &quot;Unsent&quot; make for one of the standouts on this album, with a great harmonica-closing reminiscent of the Pill days. Overall, Supposed is a decent followup to its predecessor; despite the awful album title and the embarrasing dance song &quot;So Pure&quot;. Wasnt dance Alanis's former career music? Anyway, The album is worth a looksie and definitely not lurking in Jagged Little Pill's shadow.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The idea alone of making a trilogy and then making the fourth movie in the set the first is genius.  The technology won't seem as amazing as it used to because we have come to expect it, but this movie is a good beginning to the explanation of how we got to where we started in the 70's.  I was expecting more out of the fight scenes but the characters made up for where the fights lacked.  It's Star Wars!  How can you go wrong?  I can almost gaurantee that you'll end the movie and find yourself doing Jedi impressions.
B00005R87Q|3.0|ok ok, i am very young but i can still say this movie made no sense and the only way it got better was the cars.<br />Skylines, Civics, Integras, RX-7, Supra, S2000, GS300, Is300(if u missed it), and dodge Charger.<br />the cars made this movie, NOT the actors.....<br />WAtch &quot; Legend of Speed' by Ekin cheng and &quot; Full Throttle&quot; by andy lau...REALLY GOOD racing movie ..o and &quot; Thunderbolt&quot; by Jackie Chan( Eclipse Vs SKyline in this movie and LOTS of actions)
B00000JMQC|4.0|Though I liked The Wizard of Oz starring Judy Garland as Dorothy better I did also like Return To Oz starring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy and though Return to Oz is very different it is good in it's ownright and not a terrible movie at all, I guess it's one of those movies that you either like or hate but I really liked it and I recommend this movie be watched and enjoyed and admired for it's own merits instead of being compared to A Wizard of OZ which was just an entirely different kind of movie. Retun To Oz also has given me a appreciation for the mandolin the unusual looking stringed instrument that Mombi played which another reviewer said was a piccolo but even though it's probably of little importance to anyone and probably being nitpicky but I wanted to point out that it was a mandolin and not a piccolo.
0385505833|3.0|This book reads as if it were written by a first-time novelist. The story line is dull and the characters are flatter than paper dolls. I got the feeling Grisham wrote this one in a hurry. The saddest part is that the two main characters, weary of the commercialism and chaos of Christmases past, decide to completely skip Christmas. The story would have proved much more compelling had the characters tried to skip the commercialism but find a more meaningful and spiritual way to celebrate the holiday.
B00005O3VC|5.0|It is well-known that the Pythons themselves believe &quot;Life of Brian&quot; is their best movie.  In terms of production value, it probably is, but it's not nearly as funny as &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;  Made on a shoestring budget and played absolutely straight by the troupe, it is hilarious and intellegent at the same time, as well as being charmingly rustic (due to the low budget).<br />The late Graham Chapman plays Arthur, and is perfect in the role.  He is always dignified and noble, even while taking insults from ludicrously-accented Frenchmen.  All the other Pythons have multiple speaking parts - a special highlight for me is Terry Jones as the whining prince.  The Pythons are at their pseudo-intellectual best in this, their first feature film.  My favourite part is Arthur's argument with the peasants making up the anarcho-syndicalist commune (&quot;You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!&quot;), followed closely by the opening scene of the film, where it's revealed that Arthur is not riding a horse but has a servant following him making horse-noises with a coconut (&quot;Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?&quot;).<br />The DVD is packed with nifty extras.  There are two making-of features, one made while the film was in production (by the BBC) the other made just recently.  The latter features Terry Jones and Michael Palin travelling through the country reminiscing and visiting the old locations (don't worry - it's better than it sounds!).  Most importantly, the DVD looks fantastic, and the sound is good as well, and if you're still trying to figure out what the characters are saying, you have several subtitle-caption options.  There are numerous other extras, including a version of the song &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; with animated Lego figures - hilarious!<br />For Monty Python fans, this DVD is an absolute must, and I recommend it most highly to everyone else!
0425105709|3.0|When Poirot's dentist turned up shot in the head less within hours of treating the Belgian detective, Poirot was not satisfied with the apparent lack of motive, and got even more curious when the motive was helpfully provided later in the form of another patient of the dentist dying of malpractice.<br />Amidst the array of witnesses; those who had been present on the scene at some time or other on the same day, Poirot tried to piece together a puzzling picture; who was, or is, the intended victim ?  How were the persons of Blunt, a most influential figure in the world of British finance who remained largely in the background ?  Or the rebellious Raikes who was in love with the niece of Blunt ?  Or the retired civil servant Barnes ?  Or the mysterious missionary lady Seale who inexplicable went missing soon after?<br />Red herrings abound in this story, with numerous twists and turns.  The time interval was long, with weeks or more passing between chapters, making one marvel at how Poirot managed to keep the right focus on the murder even though he must have attended to numerous other affairs in the meantime.<br />Unhappily, when all was revealed, what the book lacked was a credible motive for the murder of the dentist.  Given the resources available to and the intellect of the culprit, the killing seemed most unnecessary.
B00005RYKU|5.0|The only reason I loved this movie because Leelee Sobieski is so damn hot in it!  I've never seen her this hot in a movie before.
B00005RFVL|5.0|While on holiday in Amsterdam, I saw Robbie's concert live from the Albert Hall, and thoroughly loved it.  I've got every one of the CDs he's done that are available in the States, and was thrilled to learn that this is the top selling CD in the UK, so when I went to Scotland to visit friends, I bought it right away.<br />His cover of &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot; with Nicole Kidman is lovely, and Robbie was clearly moved when given the honour of singing with Sinatra on &quot;It Was a Very Good Year.&quot;  Jane Horrocks was a delightful accomplice for &quot;Things,&quot; and &quot;room mate&quot; Jonathan Wilkes teams up for a lively &quot;Me and My Shadow.&quot;<br />Clearly, Robbie has great respect for this music, and it's a terrific collection.  I'm sorry to say that he won't perform it in the US because of his paralyzing stage fright.  If the video of this concert becomes available (are you listening PBS, VH1 or MTV?) it's a must-see.  This is a must-have album for anyone who loves Jazz.  While Linda Ronstadt's renditions of standards with arrangements by Nelson Riddle were charming, Robbie Williams puts this tribute to Sinatra over the top.<br />Bravo!  Another hit for the Brits.  Let's have another invasion, and Robbie Williams is the leader!

B00005R87Q|5.0|I would say this is a good date movie but then I might just be the only girl in the whole world willing to sit through an action movie. It's got action for the guys and hottie's for the girls. my friends and I went to see it three times. Rookie cop Brian (Paul Walker) gets pulled in to the dangerous and illegal world of street racing after being assigned a case to find out who is robbing semis of jewelry and electronics. Brian gets more then a tough case, he finds a friend in Dominic (Vin Diesel)Leader of the top street racing gang in L.A. He gets accepted into the gang which includes several of Dom's friends his sister and his girlfriend. Brian winds up falling in love with Dom's sister and gets pulled deeper into the family secrets. When he finds out that Dom went to jail for assult and battery he learns that Dom would kill himself before he goes back to jail. But with all evidence pointing to Dom and his gang Brian must decide if he can turn in the man who had become his friend,and leave the only place that he has ever belonged. The special effects on this movie were great and the car chases were awesome!! Buy it,rent it,see it, but whatever you do don't miss it.
B00003CY0V|4.0|I tend to be easily swayed by reviews so I'm glad I watched this on DVD before reading the many negative reviews of this film.<BR>The special effects in themselves are worth price of a rental.  <BR>Mayhem is the key word in capsulating the movie.

0385335482|5.0|If you have ever known the allure of buying something you didn't need. Felt the yearning for a pair of shoes, a skirt, sunglasses, or purse &amp; had to have it no matter what the cost. Like to shop in stores with a SALE! sign in the window just because there's a sale, you will absolutely LOVE this novel. It's a hilarious story about a financial journalist named Rebecca Bloomwood and her addiction to shopping. I have to say it's the most amusing book I've read in a long time. It had me laughing out loud. After reading the first few chapters, I was captivated &amp; had to finish it the day I got it from the library. Then, I went out and bought it for 2 of my friends who also love to shop. Don't miss out on this witty read, it will have you rolling on the floor.
0385505833|1.0|Big waste of money and time. Most shallow treatment of a good idea I've seen in a long time. When I was about three-fourths of the way through, I found myself wondering if maybe he knocked it out in about 2 or 3 days. Research pretty much nonexistent. No way this would've ever been published if he wasn't John Grisham. I found several implausibilities and at least one inconsistency that must have been an oversight on Grisham's part. It also contained a few typos, something you wouldn't expect to see in publishing at this level. Seems even the publisher just threw it out there as an afterthought. I want a refund.
0380817683|4.0|Great book. Read it on a trip and hated putting it down. Really excellent light treatment of addicts and their side of the story -- and that takes true compassion to accomplish without making it a Bell Jar! Kind of an Emma-meets-Sex-and-the-City-goes-to-Rehab story. Rachel's story is told with such a sweet lightness as it takes you deeper into the truth about the tangled web, and how she dealt with it. Didn't feel I wasted a minute!
B0000067X1|5.0|I just discovered Can and I fear it may be one of those once-in-a-lifetime event type discoveries. I still almost can't believe that it's for real.  Tago Mago was my first Can album, and I was left in complete awe. To think that this was done 30 years ago!  After this I heard Monster Movie, Future Days, then Ege Bamyasi, and can I say, &quot;How, in all my years of record collecting, have I never heard of this group -- Can?!!&quot;<br />The music on this album not only precludes, but out-performs so many of today's musical genres, and it does it in incredibly groovy, irresistable way.  The grooves are insane, the beats: exciting and entrancing, hooks galore, and the mind trip can't be matched.<br />Tago Mago pioneers the deep, relentless rhythm seen today in nearly all forms of electronica, ranging from trance to industrial to acid-jazz, dub, and even drum n' bass. The diverse guitar and bass concoctions, as well as the array of singing styles that Suzuki explores, have influenced players across the spectrum of rock and electronic genres.  Clearly Radiohead must have been learning from Tago Mago's minimalist textures and jagged vocal delivery while working on Kid A and Amnesiac. The raw, mad vocals of Suzuki may have inspired the likes of Jesus Lizard's David Yow, or Butthole Surfer's Gibby Haynes, while his more subdued performances are clear inspirations to a plethora of others. It seems that the variety of jam-rock bands, and even ancestors Phish and Widespread Panic, may owe their free-form &quot;jam&quot; roots to more than just the the Dead.  And as for the experimentation of creating such soundscapes... nearly all forms of ambient music ranging from ambient dub to Einsturzende Neubauten might have been getting ideas from this stuff.<br />Who knows? Maybe they've been keeping it a secret from me this whole time.<br />But somehow the truth got out and I heard about it, and I'm sure many others have and will.  All the Radiohead and Tortoise comparisons in interviews will get the word out, and I predict very soon people will be re-discovering this group -- Can. The hipsters will be a little sore, because their diamond of a secret had just been given away, but the world will be done a favor by knowing the truth. To entire genres of contemporary music, In The Beginning There Was Can. Can owns music. Can rules.
B00004XQ83|3.0|I've noticed that every review of this soundtrack saying the original recordings of this stuff are far better than anything you'll find on this CD have gotten loads of \\"unhelpful review\\" votes. I wonder if that means people prefer the merely average over the superb? I think they don't realize how heartbreaking it is to hear this album where some of the best music on Earth is played by musicians who are considered downright frauds by much of the industry. <br />I gave this 3 stars because of the variety and it is a good quality album overall. On the other hand, so many others do these songs in a much richer, more interesting way, that I can't help but recommend anyone to just get albums of the Stanley Brothers or Bill Monroe and ignore this altogether! Flatt & Scruggs, the Stonemans and the Osborne Brothers blow this album out of the running any day. Unfortunately, this is bluegrass dumbed-down to a great degree. No wonder so many used copies are up for sale! If you're not sure what to buy a good album instead is \\"Will the Circle be Unbroken\\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, where they have many old-time stars sitting in.

0312954468|5.0|I've been obsessed with Ancient Egypt for years, and when I read River God I was able to imagine what life during this amazing age must have been like. Smith has written a fabulous novel which focuses on the actions of the eunuch Taita and his love for his mistress Lostris and her beloved Tanus. <BR>Taita is one of those chracters you cannot help but love, and you feel all of his emotions as if they were your own. <BR>I have read the following books in the series, The Seventh Scroll and Warlock, and while I did enjoy them a lot, the latter more. They never had the same magic that River God did, for this is truly Smith's finest work. <BR>If you wish to be taken into a world of intrigue, beauty, love, as well as pain and suffering, then take the time to read this novel.

They evolve from album to album and impress every time.  If you like a band whose music has a connection that makes you dance, swoon, and feel what they are feeling, this album is a great way to go.  Try their other stuff as well, they are great all the way around.

B00005O3VC|5.0|I must begin by saying that I'm preaching to the converted in this review. If Monty Python isn't your cup of tea, you won't be reading this review anyway.<br />So, is it possible to top one of the funniest movies ever made? Yes, if the original team does the DVD, which happily has happened here. The whole Python crew has teamed, in one form or another, to bring you the same manic joy that inspired their infamous 1975 movie. Among the gems that kept me laughing are: the &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; musical number, reenacted by Lego figures; three &quot;sing-along&quot; features to accompany the &quot;Knights&quot; and other musical numbers of the movie; some highlights of the movie, shown in Japanese (with English subtitles); and the fact that the DVD of the movie actually begins with a different, sub-standard British comedy before the &quot;projectionist&quot; decides to &quot;change reels.&quot; This is the kind of comedy gold that DVD's are born to reveal.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Warning: Anyone expecting ear-candy music go buy the Harry Potter soundtrack, others interesting in a dark, heavy and ethereal musical score that parallels the films epic journey proceed forward...<BR>For those comparing this soundtrack to John Williams music I have the following to say... Harry Potter is light and playful, LOTR is dark and menacing (Although it has its light moments with the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; piece and its following leif motif repetitions troughout the score). This score is Thematic, if you listen carefully there a leif motifs (Musical signature that accompanies a recurring character or object) the most obvious being what I call the Power of the Ring leif motif (track 3 &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot;) and the Hobbits leif motif (Track 2 and 5 and a variation in 17)... The battles' choral accompaniaments have been compared as copies to the Phantom Menace's &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; but I tend to disagree. Listen to Poliderius &quot;Conan&quot; and Horner's &quot;Glory&quot; and you will realize that maybe John Williams didn't invent this kind of musical movement. If you want to go to the root of this kind of Choral bravado buy Griegs &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; and Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; Symphonic scores from the beginning of the last century.<BR>LOTR is Wagnerian in scope, with lots of brass and percussion, but at times the score becomes very light and melodic. There are heart-breaking string movements followed by the haunting celtic flute sound and a Child's voice like in track 17 &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;. I rate this CD as probably one of the best Fantasy/Adventure soundtracks, with Poliderius' &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and James Horner's &quot;Krull&quot; running 2nd and 3rd place... BTW..Harry Potter fans, I liked the HP soundtrack, I own it, but I prefer things a little heavier, don't flame me...
B00005QY5Y|4.0|If you like mellow but rockin' seventies style music, this is a great album. Ryan Adams, who was given the responsibility of being Alt-Country's savior, much like Cobain was given the responisbility of being Alt-Rock's savior, never asked for it. In fact, he sheds that responsibility in much the same way that Jeff Tweedy did with Wilco. On this album, which is much more consistent than \\"Heartbreaker\\" (and has some shining moments as well), Adams gives us a taste of Van Morrison in \\"Answering Bell\\", chugging rock in \\"Nobody Girl\\", and a taste of the Stones in \\"Rescue Blues\\". The hit, \\"New York\\", is merely a story of a relationship in NYC, is a decent rocker, and is no way related to the whole 9.11.01 tragedy. Don't even think about the cover and it's inverted American flag. It doesn't have anything to do with the tragedy. Overall, it's my second favorite album of 2001, after Lucinda William's \\"Essence\\". <br />If you wanted another Uncle Tupelo album, or another Whiskeytown album, forget it. This ain't it.
0395925037|5.0|I would have to say this is one of the best books I have ever read. It uses interspersed ideals to explain a complicated but heartfelt belief.  It is actually a really sad book, when you read between the lines.  What could be sadder than the anguish of a tortured mind in a world of people with no understanding?<BR>(And by the way - the reason that the text seems so rambling is that Hitler dictated it to Rudolph Hess so it really would work better as a speech.)
B00005JKQX|5.0|A film for mind and heart - about the reality of mental illness and the tenacity of love.  Superb performances, but this is much more a journey into understanding than it is entertainment.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is, for me, the single greatest Rock album ever made. The variety alone is amazing, and the seemingly warped transitions are a harsh change to and from ABBY ROAD. As a musician, I can tell you that changing one's style is difficult, but the Beatles do it a number of times on this album (something Pink Floyd was unsuccessful at on THE WALL). Packed with classics, I was surprised (and am embarrassed to admit) that I'd somehow forgotten HELTER SKELTER. Also, the far more bluesy and rather acoustic version of REVOLUTION is actually, in my opinion, infinantly better than the electric rock virsion we hear so much today.
0679460063|3.0|I listened to Cornwell's earlier Cause of Death and Unnatural Exposure on tape and Unnatural Exposure is better.  ...  Cornwell has created a first class nail biter that is flawed because of artificially created tensions, some poor characterizations and inconsistent philosophy.<br />The mystery/thriller works pretty well on that level.  The plot follows Cornwell's heroine Kay Scarpetta initially through a serial killer's dismemberings to a possibly contagious disease outbreak.  There are twists and turns although the ultimate outcome is no great shock.  Unnatural Exposure follows a standard path although most stories of this ilk have a premature solution that turns out to be false. I.e. the wrong person is arrested or found dead.  In this one an innocent person is arrested but the reader knows it's a false arrest from the word go.  There is also someone found dead but it's pretty obviously not the guilty party.  Along the way we get graphic and gory forensic details of autopsies making the novel unsuitable for reading around mealtime.<br />There are several problems with the novel aside from the mystery.  Cornwell's agenda gets in the way sometimes and she has fillers that detract from the story.<br />Earlier in the story Scarpetta receives pictures via email that are described as gif files.  All the pictures I receive are jpgs.  Maybe this is an indication that the novel is becoming dated.<br />I had a problem with some of the artificially created tensions.  In particular, I found it offensive that airport security people would be portrayed as boobs for doing their jobs.  Scarpetta shows up at the airport with body parts and hazardous materials and the security people and flight attendants are made to look like fools for questioning her the way they do.  It seemed to me that she was the one who deserved the criticism for not notifying them in advance.  Scarpetta also keeps quiet long enough to create confrontations instead of diffusing them and she's supposed to bethe heroine.<br />The characters are generally poor.  Benton Wesley, her sometime lover, is non-descript.  Merino, her friend and sometime foil, has some character.  However, her niece Lucy is really obnoxious.  Cornwell portrays Lucy as being the victim of discrimination because she's a lesbian.  Actually someone this obnoxious is unlikable regardless of sexual orientation.  <br />However, the real holes are in the philosophy that Cornwell puts in.  Essentially, she has a new age non-judgmental philosophy which is fine if it's consistent.  For instance, she refuses to accept that there might be legitimate principled opposition to some of the views that she holds dear.  People with opposing views in Unnatural Exposure are invariably jerks if not crooks.  How judgmental is that to portray those with contrary views in a very judgmental light?  Another problem that I had is Cornwell's dismissal of Scarpetta's affair with the previously married Wesley.  The reader is told that Wesley's colleagues blame her for his marriage's failure when in fact it was Wesley's ex-wife who ran off with another man.  Cornwell ignores a number of things.  First, whether or not Wesley's ex-wife ran off in no way makes their adulterous affair acceptable.  Second, perhaps if Wesley hadn't been fooling around with Scarpetta and had spent more time with his wife then maybe he would have been able to save his marriage.  Third, Wesley should have disabused his colleagues about the cause of his failed marriage.  Allowing Scarpetta to be viewed as a Jezebel seems inappropriate and inconsiderate given Cornwell's non-judgmental tone.  Yet another problem is the penchant for male characters in the novel to approach tears or come to tears under duress.  In particular, why does she portray the gay men in this way?  If as is obvious in the novel she is trying to portray gay people in a positive light and argue that they are just the same as straight people, why don't the gay men \\"take it like men?\\"  Ireally found these logical inconsistencies got in the way of the story.  Cornwell would have a better story if she wasn't trying to preach or if she needs to preach then she should be consistent.<br />Overall it's a good mystery but the non-mystery problems take it down a notch.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Everyone told me this movie was B.A.D. That there was no plot, and AJ changed clothes as often as possible.<br />Well, they were right about her changing clothes a lot. However, this film was no worse the any Indiana Jones film, the only difference being a female lead. It was a video game to start with, emeshed in fantasy and si-fi. Why anyone was surprised by the results eludes me.<br />First of all, AJ certainly became Lara Croft. You see it not only the extras but in the film. She is probably the only actress in Hollywood who could have carried the additude off alone, much less the physical techniques. <br />This movie is a visual delight of special effects, Girl Power in your faces magnitism, and a blantant mix of every adventure film out there.<br />If you don't buy it, I at least recommend you rent it.
B00005QDW1|3.0|At first listen, I thought huh?  Where are the hits like ex-girlfriend and simple kind of life.  But since I spent 17 bucks for Rock Steady, I made myself listen to it and it eventually grew on me.<BR>You gotta appreciate track 12 &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, a collaboration with the almighty Prince.  Track 5 is vintage No Doubt with the Ska sound.  In the end it's not No Doubt's best work but it's worth getting the CD....used on Amazon.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|When I buy a DVD that's just loaded with extras, I get excited. I think everyone does. Behind the scene outtakes, interviews, how everything's done...Interesting.<br />While Shrek was a really good movie (one of few I can watch with my neice and nephew), the extras just plain stink. I spend half the time selecting the wrong thing, can't get out of the menu, and the &quot;trivia&quot; has to be read. There's no real &quot;extras&quot; on this DVD. Unless you want to talk to the screen, press a button, and get an answer. I've got an 8 BALL for that, thanks.
0743216458|5.0|Ok, it started for me when I watched the HBO series: Band of Brothers.  Back around October of last year (2001), I eagerly watched every episode and got a small glimpse into the world of Easy Company.  If you are a military or WWII buff and were not fortunate enough to watch the movie then you have to get the book.  I have read a lot of &quot;military novels&quot; and for the most part they tend to be over technical and lose the reader with details that only Tom Clancy would want (sorry Tom).  Ambrose writes Band of Brothers from the facts drawn from the actual Easy Company men and delivers a fantastic portrayal of the historical battles Easy was apart of.  From the D-Day operation eliminating the German guns barreling on the beaches to the Capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest, Band of Brothers captures it all.<br />A great read that you wont want to put down.<br />Thumbs Up.<br />As per the last lines of the book: &quot;...my grandson asked me if I was a hero...I told him no but I was surrounded by men who were.&quot;
0790731940|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since it was released in the theaters, and I happened by it while shopping. On a whim, remembering that I liked it (and am a Jodie fan) I got it.<br />I forgot how hilarious MAVERICK was, and how much of that was because of Foster. Her nack for timing and physical comedy is truely inspired, and her and Mel Gibson's chemistry is outstanding. The innuendo was both hilarious and constant.<br />And, honestly, who saw the end coming?<br />Concidering how many shows are being made (badly) into film these days, MAVERICK stands far above the rest. In being the first to do it, and the only one to do it well. Light hearted, sexy and funny, it's sure to entertain.<br />I definantly recommend MAVERICK for some light hearted fun.
6304711875|2.0|Nowhere near as clever as some movie reviewers and studio hype would have you believe. More a mildly effective black comedy than a horror movie.

0385505833|4.0|I never read a John Grisham book before until my friend gave me this to read last week. I got it done in one night and enjoyed it. I felt like I knew the characters and how they reacted to certain incidents very well. I would read it again around Christmas time next year.
B00004LN16|4.0|After reading the reviews on this disc, and although i agree with most of them, the one thing that no one has mentioned about these songs is the &quot;GROOVE&quot;!!!  AC/DC as far as im concerned lost their &quot;groove&quot; after the release of FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK.  Releases since that album have rocked, but not all the songs were that great.  This album Rocks, it Grooves, and it has great songs.  If i considered it a classic i would have given it 5 stars, but those 5 stars belong to BACK IN BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK.  Every song on those albums were killers. This one comes close.
B00004YYDI|1.0|Leon pinches liberally from John Cassavetes, a man with more than a superficial interest in the nature of love, the film in question being 'Gloria'.<br />Gary Oldman spends the film taking what I can only presume to be acting pills from a tin box in his jacket. He convulses and his body rejects them.
B00005QK3W|5.0|After hearing this record, I loaded up the CD players at home, work, and in the car with Beatles and Wings music.  Everything Paul puts out is held up to the Beatle legacy, and there will certainly be critics who drill Mac for once again failing to produce the next &quot;Revolver&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  Paul has made some great music since the Beatles split (and to be fair, a few less than stellar records, too), but his worst sin of the last 30+ years is that he's not John Lennon.  No solo Beatle has made a record that even comes close to anything the Beatles did, but Paul gets less forgiveness than the others.  One talented and innovative fellow, try as he might, will never be as great alone as he was with three (four if you throw in George Martin) equally adept bandmates.<br />On &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, some of the Beatle magic is recaptured, in songs like the rockers &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, &quot;About You&quot;, and &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; and ballads &quot;From A Lover to A Friend&quot;, &quot;I Do&quot;, and &quot;Magic&quot;.  Wings fans will like the smooth pop of &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot;, and &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot;.  None of the songs are bad or sound like filler.  The live version of &quot;Freedom&quot; is a nice addition at the end of the record.  Some have balked at its inclusion, but I say thanks for saving me the four bucks I would have spent on the CD single.  If you like Beatles and Wings music, get this album.  It evokes memories of Mac at his best, with and without the fabs.
B00003CXTG|2.0|The first half hour of this film is written as almost slapstick comedy. Now why couldn't 'Saving Private Ryan' treat the war in the innocent way it was meant? We also learn that the poor put upon Japanese were victimised by the USA with an oil blockade. Now why would they go and do a darn fool thing like that? No doubt the gospel according to Jerry would explain Nanking over their failure to lend the imperial army a cup of sugar. Alec Baldwin runs away with the cornball dialogue like there's no tomorrow and seeing as the atomic age was just dawning we can't fault him.

B00005K3NY|3.0|Perenial cult favourite that's like The Man From Uncle, only without the jokes. It does have it's own Mr Waverley though, in the form of Patrick McGoohan who wastes no time in getting down to some serious slow method mumbling. Pretension and McGoohan are old friends. He mumbled nonsense throughout 'The Prisoner'. He directed the most pretentious episode of 'Columbo' ever which featured a giggling, existential sea captain (yes, they exist) and last, but not least, acted in the queen of pretentious movies 'Kings and Desperate Men' (the king of pretentious movies abdicated after seeing 'Scanners'). <br />McGoohan complained that on most days there was no script. It shows. A black assassin seemingly killed next to a giant head turns up in another scene at a Scanner refuge. Despite his wacky ideas, Cronenberg's film making style is thuddingly traditional and there are a lot of lazy howlers too. After the conference fiasco, the doctor so blatantly injects his own hand instead of Revok's that the guards would have needed to be blind not to have spotted it. A long shot of the conference hall after the exploding head shows no body and a clean desk. Revok sets out to protect his brother by having a van his brothers sitting in get shot full of holes by about fifty shotguns. Vale and Revok are meant to be older than the other Scanners but Pierce looks ancient and there are a few old duffers at the Scanner refuge too. Kim's no teenager either, she looks the same age as Vale. As for the science, oh dear. Why didn't vale read Ruth's mind in the first place and get all the facts? I would. How can a drug that creates Scanners, calm them down? It should make them climb the walls. The traditional ending of good conquering evil also defeats the whole ethos of mind altering drugs espoused during the film's running time. Drugs are neutral, so morality should not have been an advantage in gaining the upper hand.<br />I Like the whole cold wave feel though. Everyone speaking as if readingfrom a telephone directory. Corporations fighting each other with the police not even getting a look in. Just like where I live, only without an accessible corner shop.
B00003CXCK|5.0|Why isn't this film out on DVD???<br />Speilberg makes me wonder sometimes. A film with this much impact should be on DVD. Come on, now. I've been waiting for this since DVD's came out.
B00005JCAA|2.0|If death takes a holiday shouldn't everyone in the world stop dying? Now that would be an interesting premise for a film. Death, it seems, is not a socialist. He admires and wishes to learn from a rich, successful capitalist rather than someone who has foresaken worldly goods in the service of the poor, for instance, or a prisoner of conscience in some gulag somewhere. The wine list is terrible in those places and anyway, death knows what 'The Stranglers' know, that is, it's only the children of the wealthy that tend to be good looking. Although they put it in more Anglo Saxon terms, if memory serves. The industrialist is played by Anthony Hopkins who obviously seems to view himself as an elder statesman to such an extent that he barely appears to be in the picture. He is smug and avuncular and you expect him to break out into a royal wave at any moment. Rather than lend a hand to some poor peasant whose about to have their land taken away from them by a tyrant, death lends a hand to a walking dollar sign in a less than scintilating boardroom battle that is supposed to have us laughing and cheering. Death is a bit repugnant, it seems.<br />Slow and long, the director fancies this as his 'Being There', only you get Pitt instead of Sellars. Pitt is gorgeous but looking at that face for three hours is like gorging on a box of chockies. Too much of a good thing makes you want to throw. Death bends his own rules and let's a very good looking man go on living, presumably because blood on such a sharp suit may ruin any future job interview as a male model. We can't have that, can we? As the fireworks explode and the camera pulls back on a scene of outdoor opulance, we are reminded that it's a hard life for the privileged in letting go. No longer will they be able to watch films which make them feel good about being American. I mean, death loves America. He loves low cut dresses. If I should meet Joe Black, I'll know what to say. &quot;Lend us a fiver, Joe, the lights havegone out and I need to feed the meter.&quot;

This CD is her best yet. I love every single song that I can't choose favorites.  Her CD is awesome and you love it even more after you go to her concert! Britney is an AWESOME performer!!!!! And &quot;YES&quot; she can sing! (Go to her concert and you'll see).Her concert was even reviewed as being better than Madonna's ( and it is).For all the haters.... you know deep down inside you envy Britney and her success, and to the people who don't get I'm not a Girl, Not yet a Woman...if you would listen to the lyrics of the song maybe you would understand it. Bottom line stop hating on Britney she's just trying to make a living doing what she loves! BUY THIS CD!
B000007638|5.0|Yes, I like my other McCartney fanfriends broke down the other day and purchased the England EMI import version. Tired of waiting around and listening to &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; on our classic rock station. Disc one sounds different from disc two, maybe two different sources were used. The five stars are for the performance of the band. I would purchase this only if you can't wait for the domestic. Capitol, please put some effort into the remastering and packaging of this classic. I know you can do it - look at the reissue of &quot;Band On The Run&quot;!!!
B00003CXXR|2.0|JP 3 was no match for the previous two in the series.  I did enjoy several of the scenes and the plot wasnt terrible, but the big villian dinosaur looked like a big whimp even though he kills old t-rex. the story with the son is impossible and you would have to be some sort of idiot to go on a trip without the check in hand.  The end was so stupid and way to sudden. they step out of the forest and boom. the end is dumb and the movie was too short. it was probably worth a rent but definately not one of the greats of 2001.
B00005NWM3|3.0|Not a bad second album but I still really prefer their first record.  &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is, of course, a high point, but I was a little turned off by the heavier use of thrashing guitar.  I did appreciate the in-your-face attack on domestic violence in the first track.  Well done.  The album still retains a &quot;Nickelback sound&quot; but the heavier guitar brings it closer to a hundred metal groups.
6304509154|5.0|Next to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film THE SHINING, POLTERGEIST is one of the very few horror films from the 1980s that has any business being called a masterpiece.  This parapsychological suspense thriller from co-writer/co-producer Steven Spielberg and director Tobe Hooper (of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame) offers plenty of chills, thrills, macabre humor, and superlative special effects.<br />Like a lot of Spielberg projects, POLTERGEIST involves a middle-class suburban family--in this case the Frelengs (JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson), who live in Cuesta Verde Estates, a Southern California development built by Nelson's real estate firm.  One night, however, they discover that their home has been invaded by poltergeists, or noisy ghosts.  Their young daughter Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), a clairvoyant, seems to be in contact with these ghosts, whom she calls &quot;TV people&quot;, because they eminate from the family television.  Then the ghosts abduct her from her bedroom via her closet door, spiriting her away to a netherworld somewhere between life and death.<br />This forces Williams and Nelson to seek the help of a team of parapsychologists, led by Beatrice Straight and Zelda Rubinstein, to somehow get &quot;in touch&quot; with O'Rourke.  The unconventional means used to get O'Rourke back from this ghostly storm involve tying a rope around Williams, who ventures right into the middle of &quot;the light&quot;.  When she comes out magically through the living room ceiling, she has O'Rourke in her arms.  The house is &quot;clean&quot;, or so everyone thinks.<br />But in the finale, the ghosts return to exact an even more terrible vengeance on the family.  Earlier, it was revealed by Nelson's boss (James Karen) that all of Cuesta Verde was built over what had once been a massive cemetary.  The climax has tombstones jutting up out of the ground and the swimming pool, plus skeletons and corpses.  Nelson and Williams manage to flee from Cuesta Verde alive, butthey are now homeless.<br />The alleged behind-the-scenes artistic conflict that took place between Hooper and Spielberg does not seem to have affected the quality of POLTERGEIST.  Although some scenes are gruesome enough to jeopardize the film's 'PG' rating (originally, it nearly got an 'R'), the film mostly avoids the worst gory excesses of the slasher movies of the 80s in favor of suspense and special effects.  The greatest element involved is the presence of a family unit an audience can believe in.  Special credit must be given to O'Rourke, whose performance here is one of the best ever put on by a child actor in any movie.<br />Hooper's excellent handling of the material is matched by the special effects work of Industrial Light and Magic, as well as the superlative music score by veteran Jerry Goldsmith.  Although followed by two vastly inferior sequels and a TV series that had absolutely no connection to it other than the name, POLTERGEIST remains one of the most effectively scary films of modern times and thus comes strongly recommended.

0385505833|5.0|I wasn't sure how I'd react to a non-lawyer, non-thriller book by John Grisham.  After all, I like the lawyers. I like the thrills. But, I received this book as a Christmas present, and I thought it looked interesting.  Turns out, I like accountants too.  This book is hilarious, bringing out a wickedly funny side of Grisham we only saw hints of in previous books. I actually laughed out loud, and more than once.  This book will be a new Christmas classic. And I'll never look at a plastic snowman the same way.
B0000027KU|5.0|To help consumers get it straight, Led Zeppelins first album and basically the group Led Zeppelin were a spin off of the original Jeff Beck Group. this album was recorded a full year before Zeppelin set foot in a studio together.Fortunatly for Jimmy Page his parents were rich and afforded Page and crew unlimited time to expand on the Yardbird/Beck phenomonon.Yardbirds back-up guitarist Chris Dreja stated in his book that Pagey would spend hours vomiting before a show while the Beckmeister would completely dismantle his Strat clean it a re-build for the gig.<BR>Sorry posers,if you want the real mcCoy,Beck is it!
B000059XUO|5.0|Words can't describe just how great this movie really is and at last they have released a collectors edition dvd of this fine film, it's a two disk set and it stacked out with fantastic extra's for die hard crow fans. It will always be remembered as the final movie Brandon Lee ever made (he was killed under suspicious circumstances on the set of the movie) they were just about to wrap up filming and only had a few shots of Brandon to get before he died when a blank bullet was shot off at close range leaving Brandon dead, as they were so close to finishing the film was still able to be completed. The movie is a touching story of love, death and revenge. The movie is complete with great fight scenes and a touching moral to leave you grabing for the tissues. I can't recomend this movie enough, In your life you will only see a few films that change the way you look at the world forever... This is one of them, Check it out!

0553573403|5.0|I learned of the 'Song of Ice and Fire' series by George Martin from a friend who claimed it was better than the 'Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn' trilogy by Tad Williams, which I considered the best fantasy series for quite some time. He even claimed Martin could easily match up with Tolkien, though Martin would write a completely different style of fantasy literature. Wow, quite some accolades.<br />Now after having read A Game of Thrones I just can conclude: My friend was absolutely right. A Game of Thrones starts slow, describing the main characters of this first book of a wide span epic series. But from the first moment you appreciate the details Martin uses to introduce his main cast and also the setting of Westeros. Martin's approach to this fantastic world is a more political one. Several factions are scheming against each other, and magic - the essence of fantasy literature - is only for a nanny's tales, but as the machinations unfold also the intensity of the novel rises dramatically. With the culmination of events Martin also raises the stakes of his main characters. Unlike many other fantasy writers Martin doesnt hesitate to sacrifice leading personas, even the 'good ones'. In fact Martin has a knack to make his main characters suffer in a way that the reader feels and aches with them. I always appreciated such excellence to involve the reader in the fates of the characters in a fantasy novel. Some of them you love, some of them you really hate. And there are a lot of both types in Martin's book...but you never know what fate will befall anybody.<br />This creates an enthralling atmosphere of compassion as Martin takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions and when A Game of Thrones reaches its climax at its final pages, you're as eager as anyone to learn how the forthcoming events will go on in the following books of this series. That's what I call masterly art of writing, when the book you read catches your attention from start to end, yet still leaving you anxious to the next sequel.<br />One side note: There are quite many characters readers will feel attached to. Jon Snow, the Starks, Danaerys, and many others. But, goddam, Tyrion Lannister is likely one of the most complex, yet most likable/admirable rascals you'll ever find. You can clearly see who is Martin's most favorite char. So, look out for more heart-wrenching hardships, extreme challenges but also surprising victories for Tyrion. And never forget: A Lannister always pays his debts!anxious to the next sequel.<BR>One side note: There are quite many characters readers will feel attached to.

B0000542D2|5.0|If you've never seen the first Beatles film, then now is the time to treat yourself to a real feast! This film is a classic for so many reasons, but the most important in the genuine humor and natural innocence of the early Beatles. All of the songs are wonderful, and it is a joy to see John, Paul, George, and Ringo running around having so much fun.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Here is a movie made by the numbers--stock plot scenerios--that is saved by the racing of high performance cars. Only in the movies would an undercover cop risk everything to solve a case, and then once he has done so, let the suspect not only walk away, but provide the means to do so. Just like in &quot;Breakpoint.&quot; But this is all a big &quot;nevermind.&quot; This movie hardly needs a plot. The whole purpose is to show ten seconds worth of racing.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|There's a musical sequence in the movie (can can) that is very, very impressive.     And then there's 80 more minutes of stuff.     I found myself completely bored after about 45 minutes. I really couldn't figure out why until I realized I'd almost been duped by all the shiny objects, which were desperately trying to cover up the extrordinarily dull script. After a bit over an hour it seemed that the director, and the film, simply ran out of steam, and were just trying to wrap up the film in such a way as to not call attention to the lousy story. The actual direction, once the really big numbers are over, is pretty awful. Every single time something \\"heavy\\" or dramatic happens he resorts to a blurred slo-mo of the characters in question. After seeing this same trick 5 times I was officially sick of the movie. Blim, blam, zim, zam, at the end of it all it's smoke and mirrors.    As a spectacle it works fine, but then \\"COPS\\" is a spectacle too. As a film it's severly dull.
0679879269|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of fantasy and the His Dark Materials series and this is my all-time favorite.  We join Will in his search for Lyra, and after finding her, their adventures in the many Worlds.  Lord Asriel is still preparing for the Great War and Mrs. Coulter begins to doubt herself and her position with the Authority.  Dr. Mary Malone finds a mysterious creature race, and all of the characters find something out about themselves.  As I said before, this is my ultimate favorite book and all should read it.
0736041850|5.0|This book is one of the best book I have found in this subject. I been working out for more that 20 years and studied every major book in this subject and never found anything that comes close to this book. The clarity and illustrations are the best that I seen. Don't get me wrong book such as Arnold's Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding are fine and very informative, but they concentrate on explanation (sometimes confusing) rather than Illustration which get the point accross. I HIGHLY recommendt this book for anything body who is interest in exersice and weight lifting. This book is a must for any serious athelete or fitness person. This is best for men and women as well (I never seen such a well illustrated book about women exercises). BUY IT AND ENJOY THIS JEWEL...
B000003CMB|5.0|There isn't much that I could or would want to add to the volumes that have been written about this recording and that ought to say something itself. I won't try and argue for any particular point of view or preach to the converted but I will <BR>relate a personal anecdote or two. If this helps, great. If you<BR>want a traditional review, read the others here which are good.<BR>  This album was the rosetta stone for this listener.

B00000253N|2.0|Im not a die-hard dylan fan so this review comes in that context. That said, this album has some incredible moments, especially if you understand what its like to see a relationship die. I first heard the lyrics in &quot;simple twist of fate&quot; it made me cry. generally the lyrics on the album are deep, symbolic and touching.<br />But the problem is really the music, and dylans delivery. It can be perfectly folky and distinctive, then other times grating and tedious. <br />By the 5th time you hear dylan whine &quot;eeeeyodiot wind&quot; in the plodding &quot;idiot wind&quot; you've had enough. This is supposed to be dylans &quot;mean&quot; breakup song, but it comes off as dull when you compare it to some of his other more sophisticated lyrics. if music can express emotions, does this song actually convey that? no, its just a bunch of chords dylan threw together. then dylan blows wind through his mouth singing this dirge.<br />When I hear the line &quot;I can change I swear&quot; in big girl now...it really moves me because I know exactly what that means, but then later on when dylan tries to rock out on the harmonica in that song I cringe. <br />lily, rosemary, and the jack of hearts in one of the most unbearable songs in the history of music, clocking in at 8 minutes.<br />meet me in the morning is a not so remarkable blues number. dylan cant really pull it off and it gets annoying quick.<br />shelter from the storm is a great song, a classic of course.<br />the playing on this album is pretty unremarkable. granted a folk song is not about music chops, but there are plenty of folk musicians who you can appreciate.<br />I give this 2 stars because most people gave it 5. This is by no means a masterpiece, and if it was once, it has not stood the test of time. There are some great great songs but overall this is not a great album.
B000003TAW|5.0|It seems that I had forgotten about good old weezer until recently. I pulled out the blue album and gave it a listen. It makes me remember why I liked the band so much around 94 and 95 when I first heard them. Songs like the world has turned and left me and my name is jonas are classic punk-pop songs. Their singles like say it ain't so are excellent but are just as good as the other songs on the album.
B0000024RQ|5.0|Dylan's sophomore album marks a big step for the then 22 year old singer/poet/songwriter.  On his first album he had covered many songs by his heroes and this one showed everyone that he would be a visionary poet for many years to come.  Songs like &quot;Blowin' in the wind&quot; and &quot;Talkin' world war three blues&quot; are obviously war-based but the album is well-balanced.  &quot;Girl From The North Country&quot; and &quot;Don't Think Twice It's Alright&quot; are inspired by women, love and various other things.  The arrangements on this album are more simple than his subsequent works.  Most of the songs have just Dylan picking his guitar, singing and blowing on his harp in a simple but moving way.  I like this album because it has some classic Dylan songs, that other artists have covered (Masters of War-Pearl Jam, Hard Rains gonna fall-Eddie Brickel and the new Bohemians) and it also has some more obscure songs that everyone SHOULD here.  The poetry in the songs are meaningful and they show a young man with a searching and independent mind.  Freewheelin' is a promise of many things to come.
B00005R2IS|5.0|It's about time we Americans can finally see this classic with the original Aussie accents. The dubbing on the US versions were terrible. This DVD makes me wonder how I put up with the dubbed version. A great movie that finally gets it due. It is already one of my most cherished DVD's.
B00005N9CV|5.0|When I first experienced the music of Diana Krall I was surprised at how much emotion she can show with her voice. Not only because she is a confident and able singer, but also because it is obvious that she is very much involved in her music.I bet she loves singing. The musicians are very good also. Excellent album!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie, you will probably like the soundtrack as well. I bought it only a few days after I saw it, and was very pleased. Howard Shore has done a great job capturing the different emotions of the story with each song, and it also features Enya. If you are a fan of either of them, or just thought the battle scenes were cool, buy it.
0385505833|2.0|If your looking for a typical Grisham novel, think twice before buying this one.  The story is very dull, not much depth.  The story would have been cute as a 5 page short story in a magazine.  I read it, hoping it would get better but it remained dull and boring.

0780626966|5.0|This collection is the best box set on DVD as of now.  I have always loved Freddy and now that all seven classics are together it makes it so much better. Personally part four is my favorite. It has good thrills and funny moments all in one. Many dis part two for many reasons. If you just watch it and just see how much info ths one gave us it would make mor people appreciate it. His past was exposed and made me a bigger fan of the series.     Now this set gives you all of the info on the stars and it gives you some light on how Freddy was made up. The eight DVD is a fun gme. There are all kinds of cool interviews and behind the scenes material. I hope you all love this set like I do.

0399103422|5.0|How do you rate a classic like The Godfather???  And how can you realistically award it less than five stars?<br />Well, paradoxically the three-installment movie is better than the book, if you are looking for pure entertainment.<br />However, if you are looking for insight into how the real world works, _The Godfather_ is a manual that can serve as a base from which you can build additional knowledge.<br />Use it as a spring-board into Holden's _Powerbase Selling_, for example.  Or juxtapose it with _The Bible_ and learn that nothing has ever changed, that Human Nature is essentially evil and pragmatic -- and always has been.<br />Or contrast it with Niccolo Machiavelli's _Discourses_ and _The Prince_.  You won't learn how to become successful and wealthy overnight.  But you probably will learn why you already aren't and never will be (thank God!).<br />Home truths all.  Thoroughly unpleasant to the taste, yet the real thing.
B000001FA4|2.0|The songs on this CD are just not as captivating as on other releases such as Achtung Baby.  The rhythms are fairly interesting, however the song structure relies on a simple chord structure.  Therefore, no matter how creative The Edge may be, the songs just are not well developed.  The title track, Wire, and Bad are probably the strongest tracks here and they are not overly fabulous.  Promenade is a bit incomplete and Fourth Of July sounds like mere filler.  The tone is a bit too angry for me over the course of the CD although others might not mind anger too much.  For my money, I'll choose Achtung Baby.
0790731452|5.0|A wonderful pastiche on the campy and cheesy B-grade sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's, MARS ATTACKS! features a pin-sharp script and a star-studded cast.<br />Heading the lineup are Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening and Pierce Brosnan, but there is also the game support of Danny DeVito, Sarah Jessica Parker, Lukas Haas, Natalie Portman, Rod Steiger, Martin Short, Michael J. Fox, Lisa Marie, Tom Jones and the veteran Sylvia Sidney.<br />The whole plot is, of course, Mars attacking Earth after a seemingly bungled translation job.  The President and First Lady (played by Nicholson and Close with aplomb) and their young daughter Taffy (Natalie Portman) are taken seige in the White House when the aliens nuke the entire House of Congress.<br />The key to the alien's downfall belongs to the senile yet lovable old Grandma Norris (Sylvia Sidney).  I won't spoil the surprise for those who have yet to see this hilarious film.<br />A fantastic DVD transfer is given here, with a fair few extra features.
0671688782|1.0|I read this book because my child's other parent and stepparent decided to use this therapy as a disciplinary measure. When he returned to my home and told me about it, he was in great distress. He said he would not go back to their house as long as they were doing this. H said that he hated it, that he felt like he couldn't breathe, that the more he struggled, the tighter they held him, and that if he struggled too much they wrapped him tightly in a blanket. He said that they were doing this to &quot;bond the kids and the parents.&quot; He hated hated hated it. <br />Now, maybe if they kept doing it every day for a while, he would have softened and stroked their faces? Maybe. All I saw was a very saddened child, who felt that the adults in his life were forcing something on him, and that he and they were both out of control... <br />I also read &quot;Let Me Hear Your Voice&quot; by Catherine Maurice. She met and worked with Martha, and did not leave the experience with positive feelings. Please check out this side of the story before proceeding with this method on your child.
B000003BF4|5.0|Hmm, The Allman's at the Fillmore is probably better, but this is right up there. It hits hard right off with &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; and doesn't let up (even on the slower tunes). If you're even a casual stones fan, you HAVE to get this!
0671027344|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" was an amazing book.  The writing style is very creative, and clever.  The story is simply magnificent!  I suggest every person read this, boy or girl.  I cannot reccommend it more that this, what can I say it's a fabulous book!

Enid and Seymour beings an unlikely friendship and a lot more than that but it`s slowly hurting the Friendship of Enid and Rebecca.<br />This is the first time, i realize after watching the film, it was closer to Real-Life but the thing, i find sad about this film is it was, i didn`t want to see the world of Enid to End. Based on a Comic Book by Daniel Clowes, he also written the Screenplay with Director:Terry Zwigoff (Crumb). Which Clowes and Zwigoff are Oscar Nominated for thier Best Adapted Screenplay.

B00005QDW1|4.0|This is a very good CD.  Perhaps not quite excellent, or a classic, but still worthy of one's CD collection.  Throughout musical history, the bands that survived were those that were willing to adapt and try new things.  Well No Doubt have shown that they are in this for the long haul by releasing a CD that is completely different than their earlier works (which there was nothing wrong with, but really, was Return of Saturn really that much different than Tragic Kingdom that you need both in your collection?  Maybe not.)  The overall quality varies from track to track, but there are definitely winners.  &quot;Hella Good&quot; for example, is the best No Doubt song I've ever heard, and probably worth the price of the CD right there.  Undoubtedly, the punk/ska purists will despise this CD, but for everyone else, it's a good addition to your CD collection.

There's an excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (Lost Souls), who should've been Nominated for an Oscar also. This is an instant classic. Grade:A+.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Ok... I admit it... I am a new Incubus fan, and I was only interested in them after hearing \\"Stellar\\" and \\"Drive\\" on the radio. I was expecting less when I heard this album, I was expecting a kind of top 40 ...collection of \\"rock\\".<BR>And it hasnt left my CD player since I bought it. Brandon Boyd (and yes.... he is gorgeous) actually SINGS the songs, unlike Fred Durst and others, who try to cover up the fact that they have no talent. He is loud and rebellious when he needs to be, and soft and gentle when he needs to be, but always keeping his voice at just what the song needs. Right now, my favorite songs are #11, #13, and #6, but all have equal grace and beauty. <BR>The lyrics are incredibly introspective, and require one's own interpretation. These guys are musical geniuses, and its sad to see that someone like Britney Spears outsells them. But I can tell you that Incubus will definitley be around for a very long time.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A trio of Herion Junkies (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans) trying hard to survived thier habits but going down and been pushed Rock-Bottoms in thier serapate ways.<br />Oscar-Winner:Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist) is heartbreakingly wonderful as a lonely boob-tude addicted widow sucking down on Diet pills. Burstyn recieve an Oscar Nominated for Her Strong Impressive Performance (She did Win for Best Female Lead in the Independent Spirit Awards). The film win for Best Cinematography at the Independent Spirit Awards. It was also Nominated for Best Director, Best Feature and Best Supporting Female:Connelly. Cleverly Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Based on the Novel by Hubert Selby Jr. Screenplay by Aronofsky and Selby Jr. This Film is Not for all tastes. Grade:A.
B00005JKES|2.0|All right. I loved Twin Peaks. I wanted to share the magic with my husband who has never seen one episode. I was sooo disappointed last night when I popped the DVD into the player, clicked on Episode one, and heard &quot;Previously on Twin Peaks&quot;...Previously? What the heck? Where's the REAL first episode? Artisan make a HUGE blunder by not including the pilot on this DVD. It's a shame they had to ruin this DVD collection by not including the very first episode -- without the pilot, it's hard for somebody new to catch up.<br />I'm tempted to return my copy back to Amazon.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Leonard `Lenny` Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who has a short memory spam, the only thing, he could remember seeing his wife being murderer and ever since, he can`t remember the next day and even the next few minutes before. He tattoos his body for clues or things, he doesn`t remember. The closer, he`s finding the murderer, who killed his wife, the more it`s gets worse.<br />Directed by Christopher Nolan (Insonmia-Remake) shows as one of the most promising new directors out there. The film receives Two Oscar Nominations from Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay-Written by Christopher Nolan from a Story by Jonathan Nolan. Memento did win Four Independent Spirit Awards including:Best Director, Best Feature, Best Screenplay and Best Suppporting Actress:Carrie Anne-Moss. It was nominated for the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Cinematpgraphy. This is a well written mystery suspense thriller. DVD`s has a sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and Clear Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Some might find this film to be uneven, because the film is told in backwards (Expect for the Black and White Flashbacks) and it`s not for all tastes but Still, this is a one of a kind movie. Alternate Verison of the Film tells the story foward, not backwards (as a Hidden Feature on Disc 2). Panavision. Grade:A.
0385484518|2.0|Tuesdays With Morrie was basically a story of Mitch Albom feeling sorry for some old man. While morrie's views on life were insightful, Mitch's outlook on him self and morrie cancel out the good things about this book. Page after page was constant contradictions and examples of Mitch's enormous ego. I found it weird how Mitch didn't bother looking morrie up until he saw him in poor condition on TV. Mitch only thought to visit morrie because morrie made him feel good about himself. Mitch made it sound like he was the only thing keeping morrie alive.<BR>I would only reccommend this book to someone who likes to disagree with people's opinions and actions.
B00005JKED|5.0|When a narc Rookie Cop (Ethan Hawke in a Oscar Nominated Role) starts his first day with his first partner (Oscar-Winner:Danzel Washington).

DVD`s Extras are:an good Commentary Track by the Director, Two Music Videos, Deleted Scenes, Alternate Ending and More. The Top-Notch direction by Antoine Fuqua (The Replacement Killers, Bait, Tears of the Sun), His best work to date as a Director and Screenwriter:David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, U-571, Dark Blue) wrote a terrific film. Don`t miss this Well-Made Thriller. Panavision. Grade:A.
B00005JKQX|5.0|For anyone who appreciates a film that is character-driven and, in this case, dominated by an exceptionally strong performance, this movie is for you.<br />The film does make stylistic film choices that may border on the sensational, but it does so in order to illuminate a character's inner emotional and intellectual turmoil. It is debatable whether a film can fully succeed in telling the story of such an illness as schizophrenia or not, since the subconscience is so interactive with the conscience that a film representation cannot take into account the other senses that are manipulated. However, the attempt is admirable.<br />Russell Crowe is the central pivot around which this movie twists and turns, and without his nuanced performance the movie would not have succeeded half as well.<br />It is nearly impossible to capture all of the complexities of John Nash's life in a theatrical film release. True, the film does leave out ommisions from what is an unauthorized biography. These ommisions are not grave errors. In Nasar's book, Nash's sexual proclivities practically disappear during the last forty years of his life and even though Alicia Nash does divorce Nash, she remained in close contact, eventually living with him once more until their remarriage. Would including these details in the film have added more dimension to her story? Definitely. Yet, it might have shifted Nasar's essential three act story of Genius, Madness, and Reawakening (Note: Nasar was a consultant  on the film).  <br />What is not left out of the film is the complexity of John Nash, the character. We see in Crowe's performance the arrogance, conceit, unpleasantness, awkwardness, bitterness, humility and intelligence of this man. <br />For any plot development that is left out by the filmmakers or sentimentality left to linger in its final minutes, it is Crowe's performance that fills in the details.<br />Recommended.

Catherine Keener received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress as the Rude but Arractive Maxime. DVD`s has an clear anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and An fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD could`ve used more extras like Director`s Commentary and Deleted Scenes. But this is an Instant Cult Classic. Grade:A-.
6304082428|5.0|For a wonderful book, such as Jane Austen's PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE, to be made into such an incredible movie as is this five hour adaptation is an amazing accomplishment.  The BBC/A&amp;E production of PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE brings to life the classic love story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in such a breathtaking manner that viewers will be spellbound, and wish for it to never end.<br />The acting, to say the least, is superb.  All of the characters are well performed, and seem to be exactly as they should.  Too often a movie adaptation of a beloved book will break up the original images of characters formed in one's mind by the author's writing.  This, luckily, is not the case in BBC/A&amp;E's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, in which each actor seems to have been put on earth specially for the purpose of playing their part in this wonderful movie.  Special note should go to the characters of Mr. Collins, who is as odious as one could possibly imagine, and of Mrs. Bennet, who will make viewers cringe every time she speaks.<br />The costumes are wonderful, to the extent that I wish I had the guts to wear the same style of clothing to my high school.  Oh well.  Daydreams will have to suffice.<br />Set it all on the backdrop of lush, beautiful England, add some great instrumental music, and the end result is not to be missed.  Definitely worth the five hours of one's time that it takes to see the entire movie.  Any fan of Jane Austen's novel PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE will love it, as will probably almost everyone else as well.<br />Enjoy!

For him, it's a clear thing - he wants to whack East German agent Mundt who destroyed his career even if that means he will end up six feet under ground too. Leamas is man-gotta-do school, and he doesn't realize that he is just a pawn in a chess game that hasn't nothing to do with killing Mundt.<BR>Masterpiece of characterization and suspense, this book has my deepest recomandation.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever made!!  Who could have imagined that it could possibly be better than the original release?  It's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?!  The most amazing thing about this release is that it floats in water!!  So therefore it must be made of wood!  Black Knights, killer rabbits, necromancers, shrubbers, and even so called Arthur kings can appreciate this new release.  Pie lesu domine!!!
B00003CXXI|4.0|Sometimes you read a review and wonder if the writer is talking about the same version of the film that you have seen. A case in point is Shrek - how anyone can give this film one or two stars escapes me completely (unless they have round, black ears, that is!)<br />If you thought Antz was funnier and more hard-hitting than &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;, then you are likely to appreciate this more than Disney's computer-animated product like the Toy Story series.<br />Before I had seen Shrek, I was rather put off it by the publicity artwork, which made it look cartoonish and basic. In fact, nothing on the billboards prepares you for the vibrancy and sharp grown-up humour of this film. And have you ever before seen a cartoon in which the heroine had (in the most tasteful possible way) a genuine female sexuality?<br />I was told I would like this film, and watched it against my own prejudice that told me otherwise. I was delighted.
0471413909|4.0|The book is a great overview of the human body's natural diet. Dr. Cordain does a great job explaining in detail the concepts of a Paleolithic Diet and how it translates into modern day eating. I agreed with most of Dr. Cordain's concepts except when it came to eating fat. Fat, and more specifically saturated fat, has been unfairly villainized by modern paradigms and this book does nothing to clear this misinformation. There is some evidence to suggest that our ancestors preferentially ate the fat from the animals they hunted. Cordain's diet seems to skirt this issue and combine a true paleo diet with a modern day, politically correct, low fat diet.
0380002930|5.0|I recently read this book, and I have to say that it is one of the best works of fiction I have read in quite a while. Most of what I think are the outstanding features of the book seem to have already been mentioned in the reviews already posted. However, I will discuss some of the ones that particularly appealed to me.<br />Richard Adams manages to create a completely self-contained and credible universe for the rabbbits who are the central characters of the story. <br />Clearly he spent a lot of time researching the lives of rabbits, (he mentions his debt to &quot;The Private Life of the Rabbit&quot; by R.M. Lockley in the Acknowledgements section). For me, the point that most clearly shows the care that Adams has taken is the very careful and enjoyable outline of the mythology of the rabbits. They even have their own Creation Myth!! I also liked the occasional telling of the mythical exploits of El-ahrairah the Prince Rabbit at various points in the story. Adams manages to build a totally beleivable rabbit mythology.<br />It has been said that the inclusion of a map in the front of a fantasy book is a bad sign, as it usually means that you are going to be dragged into every part of it at some stage, whether you like it or not. However, in the case of this story it mercifully proved to be not so. Indeed, the maps assisted the story rather than distracting from it.<br />The plot is well thought out. One tiny quibble I have with the plot is that the central characters dont realise that they will need some females to populate their new warren till they have actually reached Watership Down. The getting of females forms the central plot of the second (and most exciting) part of the book. However, this is a minor quibble and it is necessary to sustain the story.   <br />The characterisation was good as well. (I particularly liked General Groundwort and Keehar). I'm starting on Shardik in a week or two. I hope it's as enjoyable.
B000021XS0|5.0|Metropolis part 1.  Probably Dream Theaters most recognised song, while not their best (A Change of Seasons of course) it was amazing, plus that part 1. to it.  Of course fans expected a part 2 someday.  Non of us expected a whole album devoted to part 2.  Not only did we get our sequel but it also turned out to be Dream Theater's best work yet.  Not only does the band showcase their jaw dropping skills but also, the songs don't seem to wander around with the jamming they used to do.  They are the perfect length, I can't imaging the epic Home being any shorter, or longer for that matter.  And I also cannot see any other songs at any different lengths.<br />Like most prog albums, this has a great idea behind it.  A murder mystery only Dream Theater could create music for.  LaBrie's vocals are outstanding, nowhere near as over-dramatic in the past, but they seem just right when they come to.  Instrumentaly, the album is simply amazing.  But any Dream Theater expects that, and they do not dissapoint at all.  The addition of Jordan in the keyboard department was great.  He's a far greater Keyboardist than any of the other former DT keyboardists.  He has seemed to put the life back into the band after the dismall Falling Into Infinity.  Plus his work on their next album (yes I've heard it already) makes the album that much better too.<br />If your a prog fan and you don't have this album, what the hell are you waiting for?
0803723865|5.0|With kids ages 4.5 and 2.5, I've read a lot of kids books lately. This one has a catchy rhyme, interesting pictures, a great tale, and a good moral. It's my favorite!
0871137380|5.0|This book is right on the money.  I found only a couple of [very minor] inaccuracies.  I was in Mogadishu during this period.  I was not a Ranger however, one of the guys mentioned in the book later transfered to my unit. Not only was Bowden able to recount a very accurate account of what happened over there, he put it in such a way that places the reader in the gunsights of the Somali thugs that were causing us so much frustration.
B00005OM4N|4.0|OK- I am not a big fan of Britney, so when my lil sis bought this album, I was ready for more of her typical talentless, whiny-voiced crud, but I was totally surprised. This CD is definitely the best thing Britney has ever done!!! I love &quot;I'm a Slave&quot; b/c it's so fun and different, but I also liked &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;What It's Like to be Me&quot;, both of which are just great, catchy kind of songs. I'm a dancer + let me tell ya- the people at my studio are gonna be hearing this CD for a long time to come.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch has got to be my favorite movie.  I bought it on VHS almost 2 weeks ago, and i watched it about 10 times and never got tired of it.  About one week ago, I bought the DVD for all the extras.  The VHS is wonderful, but the DVD is even better.  On DVD, you have behind the scenes (with the actors and special effects), deleted scenes, pictures, filmographies, comments.. just great stuff, especially if you like the movie.  The only thing I would change about it is the fact that it didn't show enough Benicio del Toro.  But that's my opinion.  The movie is still completely AWESOME and everyone should go buy it now, its worth it. <br />(the effects are great, the plot is great, everything about the movie rocks, plus brad pitt has his shirt off in a few scenes -- don't worry though, this is NOT a \\"chick flick\\".. thats just a bonus) .. *AND this movie is HILARIOUS -- clever too, not stupid like Dude Where's My Car?*<br />PS: The SOUNDTRACK to this movie kicks [butt]!!!!
6302732778|5.0|Some people I know didn't like it mainly because they couldn't understand it. I didn't quite understand it when I first saw it as a teen, yet that's what held the greatest attraction for me. I've watched it again and again--usually waiting a year or more between viewings--and sensed it maturing like a fine wine (or has it only been my mind?) to the point where I now savor it completely. A delicacy of a film based upon the intriguing novel of PK Dick, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?. Watch it again. Feel the cold rain on the overcrowded streets. Look up at the hovercars gliding by amidst towering concrete decay. Watch Harrison Ford's perplexion grow as his character, Deckard, finds himself caught in an emotional warp of half-truths and ever-imminent danger. If you don't love it, you just haven't seen it enough.
B000003GBN|3.0|First the sound quality is just satisfactory!coming to the performance it is fairly straightforward and good.nothing more than that.Better performances are offered by Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic for both these symphonies.as for the seventh my favourite is the MAGNIFICIENT performance by the legendary BRUNO WALTER and THE COLUMBIA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA-Walter's pacing and buildup with subtle changes to the tempo and dynamics is just masterly-Full of Power and Joyous abandon.The Sound quality is quite good with Sony's 20 bit mapping.
0061053147|5.0|I fell in love with the film some years back, and with every fresh viewing find it ever more intriguing. This book answered some of the questions I had concerning the film and Dick's book Androids, and also opened my eyes to a few little-known facts and unused ideas concerning the film. I loved the photos and sketches and easy style the book was written in. A must for any true Blade Runner or PK Dick fan.
B000002MUQ|3.0|This album is definetely a dissapointment after the coherent sense of purpose created on the Carnal Knowledge album.  It took four years for this album to come out which is far longer than usual for this band.  It sounds like the bandmembers were probably spending far more time with their families than they were with each other.  It's like they threw some songs together on a trip to Amsterdam, and said &quot;Wham Bam&quot;, there you go.<br />&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, is heavy like &quot;Poundcake&quot;, but unfortunetly not nearly as good.  You want to like this song, but it just sounds too serious for VH.  &quot;Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, is a bonafide pop hit with good lyrics.  As a ballad it's very upbeat, but not in the same league as &quot;Love Walks In&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot; (5150), or &quot;When It's Love&quot; (OU812).<br />&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a decent rocker which preaches about the importance of freewill.  Nice guitar solo.  The song contains what seems an obvious mention of the 1994 shotgun suicide of Kurt Cobain: &quot;Ain't gonna tell you what's right for you/I've seen the damage done/Down with the shotgun&quot;.  Here Cobain is cast as a christ-like martyr.  &quot;I get down on my knees and pray/Now I'm saved by a higher voice/Givin' up my choice&quot;.  As on, &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; (OU812), and, &quot;Judgement Day&quot; (Carnal Knowledge), Sammy thus reveals both his preoccupation with religion, and his ambivalence towards it.<br />Ed's chops are nice on &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, but the song just sounds like an advertisement for how you &quot;don't have to worry bout the man&quot;, when it comes to marijuana in Amsterdam.  As such it's sort of an embarrassingly cheesy topic for a song.  On the hyper-boogie tune, &quot;Big Fat Money&quot;, Sammy just babbles in a breathless rap-scream.  The song does appropriately convey the insanity of American life where people often drown in material things they've no time to enjoy.  The awfulballad &quot;Not Enough&quot;, manifests a definite staleness.  Van Hagar's well of power ballads seems to have dried up here.  &quot;Aftershock&quot;, is built on a good riff, but makes a bad song.  The first guitar solo at least has a moment of pop brilliance.  The second guitar solo also rocks.  &quot;Baluchitherium&quot; is a powerful instrumental which evokes images of olympic gymnists gracefully striving to push themselves to unprecedented levels of skill and endurance; A great song to work out to.  &quot;Take Me Back&quot;, features good dynamics:  Acoustic guitar verse, electric verse, and then a crunchy chorus.  Ed's guitar playing is more interesting than the song itself though.  The chorus riff on &quot;Feelin'&quot;, has a great crunch to it as well, and there is a wild hyper-speed solo part.  But with lyrics like, &quot;grow it long, shave it off/life is hard, never soft&quot;, whatever Sammy's feelin' just doesn't seem very genuine.<br />This is perhaps the worst VH album.  Yes, even worse than VHIII with Gary.  With Sammy pushing 50, the strain in his voice was quite apparent and no doubt contributed to it being his last with the band.  Many of the songs sound too screamy, like he was substituting bluster, for passion.  If you only have one or two VH albums, pass this one over until the others turn you into a VH freak like me.
B000002IZM|5.0|At the time, I didn't realize my New American Orchestra version wasn't Vangelis' soundtrack. I'm glad to have them both for the slight variations of some tracks and the blatant, uniquely Vangelis' own cuts which take this version far beyond the scope of the latter. Enter a dark and dreamy futuristic world which often feels cold and lonely, sometimes steamy and hot, with this somewhat bluesy/jazzy new age electronic masterpiece filled with bittersweet imagery and dialogue from the film. Even if you never saw or liked the movie, you'll be hard pressed to resist the sexy, saxy love theme everyone should have in their music collection. Brooding, mysterious, hopeful, energizing Vangelis brings you one of his all-time best collections under the title of Blade Runner.
630512762X|5.0|the plot for this movie considering what it was might have faltered but Cage and Travolta's performance work nicely to fit the sequences. John Woo at his best in this film. Plenty of bullets fly!
B0000029GA|5.0|This is one of the best albums to come out of the mid 90's when rap was still an art of the ghetto and not an MTV marketing tool. Nas along with Mobb Deep and the whole WU-tang are a last of a breed of rappers that came up in the midst of east coast west coast drama that can still get people to purchase records today. This era, although very ignorant and inconspicuously violent(SUGE KNIGHT) was hands down the best era of rap. Ten years from now when I am thirty I doubt I will be listening to as much rap as I do now, but ILLMATIC will not be too far from my cd player(that is if they do not come up with a new format to play music on by 2012).It paints a picture of the mid nineties so clearly that it is like a window to my childhood. Jay Z knows that Nas and Mobb Deep have produced two of the most influential albums to come out in what he thought should of been his time to shine and it is haunting him. He knows that he will be remembered as the Karl Malone or Roy Jones of rap because he came 2 little 2 late and even if he is the best in 2000 he was not the best and wouldn't have even ranked with the greats of the mid 90's when it counted.<br />MOST INFLUENTIAL ALBUMS<BR>     OF THE 90'S <BR>   <BR>-in release date order-<br />-Preditor, by Ice Cube<BR>-The Chronic, by Dr. Dre<BR>-36 Chambers, by Wu Tang<BR>-BDFU,by Onyx......can't sell now <BR>-93 til infinity,by Souls of Mischief.....cant't sell now<BR>-Doggie Style, by Snoop Dogg          <BR>-Illmatic, by Nasty Nas                <BR>-Ready 2 Die, by Biggie Smalls<BR>-Me Against the World, by Tupac<BR>-The Infamous, by Mobb Deep<br />........by the time Jay Z came out these rappers were already on thier second or third albums that over shadowed a brilliant and shamefully underated &quot;at the time album&quot; -Reasonable Doubt-. The Tupac and Biggie deaths also overshadowed this remarkable album.<br />    I have not said much about Illmatic in this review and that is quite simply to prove the point. Illmatic is implicit, It is deeply rooted in hip hop and so is NAS. And that is why Jay Z was defeated in NEW YORK over the airwaves because any real person who ever tried to write a whole rap song from 95 onward plays Nas or the other albums I listed above in the background. And this tears Jay apart because he knows NAS does not have to say another rap in his life after this album.<br />                     HE WHO DOES NOT FEEL THIS ALBUM <BR>                     DOES NOT EXIST, SO POOF VAMOOSE!!!  jay-z
0446677450|2.0|This book makes some good points about money.  But,the book seems more reared toward children age 8-17 that any adult.  Yet, im sure many adults could learn from this book. overall this book was a little boring; and seems very fabricated at times.  I probably could have written a better book about money over a bathroom break.  The book seems to stress that education is not very important, entrepreneurs are rich, and everyone is poor and useless.  I disagree!  Being a budding entrepreneur myself i see the benefit of a formal education on a daily basis.  The networking, social skills, and basics in all aspects of business(which every entrepreneur should know...accounting finance etc.) are gained from formal education.  Sure, common sense is not.  On that note i must agree with the author.  But to condemn education so, i find it hard to digest.
B000002UUX|4.0|This is a great album, very fast and very technical, but it isn't quite perfect.  It does have its merits.  It's very progressive, much more than any of their other albums, and it showcases their musicianship like no other album they've put out.  I already knew that Dave and Marty were great guitarists, but there's also very technical drum and bass work.  I had greatly underestimated Nick and David's skill levels.  So, a fast, heavy, progressive album, what's not to love?  Why not five stars?  Well, as great as this album is, it is not without its flaws.  For one thing, Dave's vocals are a bit shrill and thin.  He's not that great of a vocalist anyway, but his vocals are greatly improved on later releases.  Also, there's no real hook here.  It's good music, but I just don't feel like I'll be listening to it over and over.  But hey, like I said, it's good stuff.  Those who put this album down for not being &quot;thrashy enough&quot; are, for one thing, wrong, it's pretty thrashy, and plus it's more of a progressive album anyway.  Just listen to all those instrumental passages, and that little bass solo in &quot;Hangar 18&quot;.  Mixing thrash and prog. is a great idea, I just don't think it was done to perfection here.  Listen to Iced Earth's &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, or Dream Theater's &quot;Images and Words&quot;.  Both solid albums.  But, I hope I'm not turning anyone off, this is still worth checking out, all the way.  It's as heavy as any Metallica album, and much more technical (I love Metallica, but I'm not sure they're even good enough musicians to make an album like this).  It isn't Megadeth's best, IMO (that would be either &quot;Youthanasia&quot; or &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;), but it's still very good.  Highlights are &quot;Lucretia&quot; and &quot;Hangar 18&quot;.  Megadeth is one of the few thrash bands staying true to their metal roots today, so do support them.  They deserve it.
014028009X|5.0|Books in the past I've loved, but rarely do I find a book that i truely cannot put down. An easy read, Briget Jones's Diary gets into the mind of a thirty-something frusterated english woman with a roller coaster life. Through cheating boyfriends, pyscho mother, gay best friend, workplace flirting, and not the mention the ever halarious weight issues, Briget always has something to write. Kept me laughing out loud (literally). HIGHLY reccommended.
B000001FTD|4.0|You know, it's albums like this that really make me wish I'd grown up in the 80's.  As a high school senior, I am steeped in the &quot;Korn-Limp Bizkit generation&quot;, and I hate it.  I have no interest in that kind of music, whatsoever.  The 80's were a golden age, when bands like Metallica, Slayer, and Iron Maiden were putting out one great album after the other.  Of course, it wasn't popular, that would be hair metal, but even that stuff was better than the numetal and rapmetal today.  Anyways, in that golden era, this album was one of many to come out.  &quot;Among the Living&quot;, an album replete with crunching, head-banging rhythms, technical skill, and even some melody.  Scott Ian is one the top rhythm guitarists (up there with Jon Schaffer of Iced Earth), Dan's solos are great, Frank and Charlie are both superior on the drums/bass, and Joey Belladonna is probably one of thrash's better vocalists (but I wouldn't compare him to Bruce Dickinson).  All in all, a good album.  So, why only four stars?  Well, the reason for that is that this album is just a little too &quot;punkish&quot; for me.  I have to give the band credit for trying something new and not sounding exactly like every other thrash band, but I just cannot stand punk, and all the shouty choruses just get on my nerves.  It kinda brings the album down a bit.  But oh well, it's still far better than any punk band I've ever heard.  One thing that Anthrax has on other thrash bands is that you can actually hear the bass.  Metallica and Megadeth had two of the greatest bass players of all time, but half the time you couldn't even hear them, and I can't think of a single moment in a single Slayer song where you can hear the bass at all.  But, Anthrax always has audible basslines throughout, much like Iron Maiden.  So, anyway, this is a very good thrash album.  I wouldn't put it on the same level as &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; or &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, but if you're like me and you feel like throwing your radio against the wall every time that stupid &quot;My Way or the Highway&quot; song comes on, this is a good album to buy.  Long live thrash!wing your radio against the wall every time that stupid &quot;My Way or the Highway&quot; song comes on, this is a good album to buy.  Long live thrash!
B000002KAT|5.0|Perfect. An album to go to sleep to and wake up to. And for all those moments in between when you want to chill - and be moved.
B00005RYKV|5.0|Brother was the first Takeshi Kitano film that I saw and I loved it!  The great thing about this film is that it is not the typical Hollywood garbage that you are so used to.  It is not a neat tie a ribbon around it, and stick a pretty bow on top type of film.  This beautifully filmed, riveting crime drama is a must see! It is very refreshing to see a film from a non-western perspective. Kitano's presence is extremely charismatic and engaging, though he says little and his filmmaker's eye is unmatched. A+++++ film.  <br />My only problem is that the DVD did not have any special features about the movie.  This is a travesty for such a wonderful film.
6300214753|5.0|this is the greatest movie ever. period.(and i dont even think that i was born when it came out) it always puts me in a great mood. cameron is the coolest guy ever and almost as funny as ferris himself. the begining is probably the funniest but its still an awesome movie.
B00005QB9A|5.0|I cannot believe that this picture did not get more recognition upon its release. The story is truly original and heartwrenching while the quality of the cinematography is magnificent. I personally feel that Tim Roth should have recieved higher praise for his portrayal of 1900. His acting is understated, and he is pathetically precious as 1900. I wanted to give my heart to this tragic and beautifully pained piano man. Such a response must be some indication of this film's calibur. Beautiful, romantic, and tragic. I could not have loved this film more.
1587990717|5.0|This is a relentlessly logical examination of the age-old question &quot;If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?&quot;  With acerbic wit the author examines the wealth of the dumb, and forces the reader to examine very closely the difference between skill and luck in one's own life.  Taleb is clearly obsessed with introspection of his own life, and has humbled himself before the altar of chance -- his sincerity shines through, despite his pomposity.
0783226004|3.0|Sneakers is the simple story of a man whose past catches up to him.  This could be high-drama, and yet that isn't the overall mood of this film -- instead, it seems like the movie is going for a sort of Butch and Sundance in high-tech-land, without Butch.  In place of a second lead, Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) gets four friends who just happen to also be his employees in a firm that essentially investigates businesses security systems.  These friends are played by really fine actors, including the superb Sidney Poitier.  Unfortunately, some of the characterizations are stereotypes, and most of these excellent actors are not given enough screen exposure.  The story centers around Bishop/Redford, and at times it seems like there are almost too many additional characters, good guys and bad guys.  This takes focus away from the plot, which is a cute story of high-tech intrigue that is more entertaining than exciting.  To draw in a female crowd, Bishop/Redford has an ex-girlfriend that, in the midst of some dangerous times, he decides to woo into returning to his embrace.  Maybe he should have handled his dangerous problems first?  Oh, but he is Robert Redford so he does get the girl, wins at the intrigue, turns into the hero and gets some pro-liberal Democratic political messages into the script as well.  I found that this film was actually lots of fun, despite its drawbacks, until a scene came up that threw me.  Bishop is kidnapped and locked into the trunk of a car.  Transported, he only knows his location by the sounds he has heard along the way.  Once safely returned, his friends pick his brain to determine what the sounds were, including a cocktail party he said he heard which turns out to be a geese farm with lots of clucking.  This is nearly a word-for-word rip off of an old Rock Hudson film, Blindfold (which by the way was a lot more exciting and a lot more entertaining).  Sneakers ends, too, with a rather ridiculous segment where everyone is negotiating withthe NSA (played too briefly by James Earl Jones) for their fantasy toys like a Winnebago in exchange for turning over the stolen super-duper mystery decoder that was at the heart of the plot.  I suppose it was all played for laughs, and some of it was amusing.  On the whole, the technological antics are quite dated, looking rather feeble in comparison, say, with the Lone Gunmen of the X-Files.  Mary McConnell does an admirable job as Bishop/Redford's girlfriend, and refreshingly, she is mature enough to come off as being close to his age (films pairing older men with much younger women are getting pretty boring by now).  Ben Kingsley plays the bad guy, although he is never all that menacing.  I was sorry to see him in a film like this after he did such a fine job with the far more meaningful Ghandi.  You will enjoy this film if you like light-weight mystery and intrigue or if you are a fan of one of the stars.
B0000524E5|5.0|Coyote Ugly may not be the ideal family movie but it is excellent.  it tells the story of young female musician whose only dream is to have someone like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey sing her songs.  After moving to New York on her own she is forced to find work in order to remain living in her apartment.  She meets up with the Coyotes and finally finds her dreams through them.  Excellent movie with a great cast.
0141301104|5.0|Witches by Roald Dalh  is a great book for all ages because it is a non-fiction fairy tale. It is interesting how the  witches think they can turn the kids into mice. It is also amusing how the witches have square feet, blue spit, claws instead of hands, and bald heads. They hide there pointy claws with white gloves and there baldness with wigs. How they find kids is by sniffing them out with their long noses. Witches is a great book especially if youare supersticious.
B00005O5CM|4.0|This movie is great for all you teenage girls out there.  Other viewers will enjoy it too, but it was obviously made for the female teenage audience.  The story tells of a college girl who tries to get into law school after she finds out her ex-boyfriend is going there too.  It really proves to girls that no matter what people think about you, you should never give up on a goal.  Reese Witherspoon plays the role perfectly.  This movie is great!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a conundrum and a masterpiece; it is a truly original musical, even though all but one of the songs or snippets are well known, previous pop/rock hits.  Kidman and McGregor are fabulous.  The day after I watched the DVD and 4 hours of extras, I bought the CD (which could have had more selections from the movie).  I hope this isn't the last we hear of Ewan McGregor's singing--WOW!!  Also, I now have a theory of why Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are divorced; there are some VERY convincing fireworks going on between Kidman and McGregor.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Its also great for guys and girls.  For the guys there are tons of war scenes and Kate Beckinsale.  Also for the girls there is the romantic twist and Benn Affleck aong with his co-star new hearthrob Josh Hartnett.  Together these three bring to life the story of December 7, 1941 when America was attacked at Pearl Harbor.  It has many true events mixed in with lots of great drama.  This movie is for everyone!!
B000055XMF|3.0|I have been waiting for someone to put Quadrophenia to disc for YEARS!  Finally someone (Rhino) did.  The movies is still awesome.  Unfortunately, the producers of the DVD fell way short. They attempted to &quot;restore&quot; the film.  They did a lousy, cheapy job of it.  Using a device called a Rank to enhance/color correct the film, it failed miserably.  The Rank is good but you cannot stop there, you must DRS (Digital Restoration System)the film to remove dirt and scratches.  Merely using the Rank is the poor man's way out.  The disc allows you to see a split screen of the old and new.  The old looks better most of the time!  You can tell they didn't &quot;restore&quot; the film by looking at the very first shot of the movie, when Jimmy is on the cliffs.  There are more scratches on the film than on my old Quadrophenia vinyl LP from 1979!  Truly hideous and disappointing.  They should have fixed this.  <BR>The sound is equally weak.  First off, in the professional world, they don't use Protools for mastering audio, especially 5.1 audio (more shocking that they even admitted it right there on the disc). Another lame attempt to consumers into thinking they &quot;restored&quot; it.  When you switch from original stereo to 5.1, it sounds like you gust turned the volume up a few notches, sot to mention all of the pops and cracks that are still present in the sound.  Obviously they must have had poor elements, or would/couldn't attain original source audio.<BR>The menus are also weak.  Here was a chance to do something really creative, but all they did was pulled some images from the film, made them different colors and threw them onto the screen.  Unfortunately, they did biography menus too that were all static and boring as well.  The WORST was the &quot;pop up video&quot; feature.  Almost always worthless trivia having nothing to do with the film!  They could have hit a home run with this feature, but they didn't even make it off home plate.  Rhino has also included a photo-gallery of old press photos, and continuity pictures.  This also could have been cool but they are so small and poorly digitized onto the disc, that they aren't worth looking at.  The producers should have cleaned them up and enhanced them or not included them at all.  By far the best thing they did was to get the director to do a commentary.  It was great.  Worth the price of the disc just for this.  But I have to ask:  weren't there any other actors in the film?  Perhaps some of them could have participated on the commentary track, I know that most of them are available.<BR>The bottom line is that the film is always going to be great and the DVD version blows the old VHS away, but the people at Rhino fell asleep on this one (though I still bought two).
0684800713|5.0|I am quite surprised by some of the negative reviews.  But I suppose Hemingway is not for everyone.  I am certainly glad that I bought the book and read it.  It is one of the best books I have read in a long time!  And I read a few books each week.  The book is a masterpiece, in my opinion.  And I will read it again after a few months, and definitely get more out of it during the second reading.  It is that type of book, if you know what I mean.  There is a lot of depth in the story, in the dialogues, in the characters that is easy to miss if you simply read the book on the surface.  I highly recommend this book!<br />I personally bought this book based on one of the reviews I read.  I simply remember that the reviewer had written that after reading the book, he continued to still think about the characters and reflect upon the story.  It amazed me to consider that a book could be so intriguing.  So, I bought it and just finished it.  The book is amazing.  Normally I read fast-paced mystery or suspense novels.  But it was more difficult for me to put this book down, and there was certainly no suspenseful plot!  <br />Mr. Hemingway's characters were brilliantly portrayed.  They really come to life on each page.  I wish I could tell you all of the wonderful things, but it would be better for you to buy the book and discover them for yourself.  Mr. Hemingway distinctively reveals each character while not taking away from the odd comradeship among the expatriates.  <br />I am an American who has lived in Europe for the last 9 years.  So, I am very acquainted with the lifestyle among expatriates.  And I think he very accurately described it, even though it was so many years ago.  I especially like how he shows the instant comradeship among expatriates (even as they meet for the first time), and yet how they can still lack any serious or deeply intimate exchanges.  It is very realistic.  Perhaps that is the best description of the book:  it is very realistic, while intriguing.<br />Many expatriates I know living in Europe bounce around from bar to bar, or cafe to cafe, drinking probably more than normal.  Keep the story in the context of expatriates living in Europe.  If you try to associate it with normal American life, it will not make very much sense.  It is the reason why the good qualities and the defects of certain characters really stand out.  Everything seems to be accentuated when you are living in another culture.<br />Also, Mr. Hemingway really amazed me at his eye and ear for detail.  I never once got the impression that I was overloaded with detail.  In fact, I was amazed at how much detail he could put within a few sentences.  I think all of my senses were activated through his descriptive writing.<br />Long story short:  I highly recommend this book!
B000002KON|5.0|absolutely fantastic album, i am a rabid kinks fan, (i have 30 or so of thier cds). this one to me is good enough to go with dark side of the moon and abbey road. i am just amazed that 22 people have reviewed this album, and not 1 of them mentioned the most incredible, hard rocking, social commentarys ever recorded. oh well, i guess that just showes how different kinks fans can be from one to the next.   ps the song is called brainwashed.
0684800713|5.0|I am quite surprised by some of the negative reviews.  But I suppose Hemingway is not for everyone.  I am certainly glad that I bought the book and read it.  It is one of the best books I have read in a long time!  And I read a few books each week.  The book is a masterpiece, in my opinion.  And I will read it again after a few months, and definitely get more out of it during the second reading.  It is that type of book, if you know what I mean.  There is a lot of depth in the story, in the dialogues, in the characters that is easy to miss if you simply read the book on the surface.  I highly recommend this book!<br />I personally bought this book based on one of the reviews I read.  I simply remember that the reviewer had written that after reading the book, he continued to still think about the characters and reflect upon the story.  It amazed me to consider that a book could be so intriguing.  So, I bought it and just finished it.  The book is amazing.  Normally I read fast-paced mystery or suspense novels.

B00005R87Q|4.0|Although there were many holes technically in the movie, it still delivered visually with more impact than expected. It also accurately depicted the SoCal street scene to my surprise. The reasons why I didn't give it a perfect score were that they needed a little help in the technical advisory department as well as suffering from somewhat &quot;corney&quot; acting among a few of the performers. But hey, the love of street racing made me forget about the cons! Overall, this movie rocks with many props going to Cohen for its creation. I've waited a long time for the &quot;Millennium edition&quot; of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; to hit the big screen. Definitely worth to have in your DVD library.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I am a Nicole Kidman fan.  I like the soundtrack to Moulin Rouge. However, I must say this is the most ill-directed, ill-conceieved piece of trash to come out of Hollywood in the past seventy-five years.  The &quot;plot&quot; is assinine.  The characters are weak.  What passes for cinematography is at best wretched.  Don't waste your money.  Don't even waste your time.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I feel kind of sorry for the Strokes - there's no way in ten Hells they could have ever lived up to the massive hype dumped on them by the media. It's not their fault (well, maybe it is, considering the members' well-placed media connections). And sure enough, Is This It is fairly disappointing. This is a pretty darn modest record for a bunch being proclaimed the saviors of rock 'n' roll. It's not at all bad, mind you - some of the songs are knockouts. Most of them, however, sound exactly like each other, with little distinguishing characteristics other than a few decent hooks buried under a repetitive drone. The Velvet Underground and/or Television (the two revered rock icons to whom the Strokes are most often compared) this ain't. And if the singer is so good, why does he hide behind vocal processing for the entire record?<br />The Strokes are a band of great promise, and they may yet turn in a fantastic record a few years down the road. But Is This It isn't it. Saviors of rock 'n' roll? Try the BellRays instead.
0425107469|5.0|Watchers was the first Koontz book I read, except for his Ace Double SF book published in the 60s, which I still have).  This book impressed me so much that I started buying all of his books in hardback, something I had not done with any author until this book.  It is one of his best and is equally loved by men, women, older children, and most smarter dogs.<br />Don't miss it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Haven't heard anything like this one in the last few years. Got me listening to it again and again.
B00004U2G4|5.0|_Truth_ was the eagerly-awaited solo debut from Jeff Beck, who had first hit the scene as a Yardbird. This album pre-dates Led Zeppelin's debut by several months and features some of the same feel - heavy blues songs and some impressive lead fretwork. Re-arranging older material results in some first-rate tracks, including a strident, pyrotechnic version of the Yardbirds' hit &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, a nice &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and the album's grand finale, a wah-wah drenched take on &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot;, usually considered to be one of Beck's best moments ever. Another highlight is the instrumental &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot; co-written by Jimmy Page. Jeff Beck is here supported by a lot of side talent, including Rod Stewart (vocals) and Ron Wood (bass). Simply put, _Truth_ is one of those essential guitar albums of the 60s.
B000002KHH|5.0|Yes, despite the fact I consider this album to be the second metal album ever made(the first I consider to be Sabbath's self-titled debut), I think this is possibly metal's ultimate masterpiece. I don't understand how some reviewers said that Sabbath's music lacks complexity and craftsmanship. Sabbath introduced a new style of music--heavy metal. Probably _Paranoid_'s only metal rival is another Sabbath great, _Master of Reality_. Every song exhibits amazing creativity, lyrically and musically. Of course the guitar work on &quot;War Pigs,&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; and &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; is creepy, brilliant, and yet catchy and groovey; the drums on &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Rat Salad&quot; numb the mind; and &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; and &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; just shows how weird and talented these guys were on here. I think &quot;Rat Salad&quot; and &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; are the only songs that haven't been covered by other bands. Sabbath introduced a morbidity and social commentary and opposition unprecedented in music, with their doomy-yet-aggressive sound and lyrics focusing on subjects the mainstream wished not to talk about--the horrors of war, insanity, and drug addiction. Speaking of drugs, I find it crazy to think these guys recorded this stoned out of their minds and all in one shot over a period of three days. Talk about musical genius! Now, if you don't have this album, get it now, and all their other stuff, too. You won't be sorry.
6305342776|4.0|Like many of these 70's sci-fi movies, this one had been crying out for a new release, especially with DVD coming along. The transfer is very good, with a good digital soundtrack, but the widescreen version is not anamorphic in the current edition which is a pity.<br />There is a lot of good special effects work, and some very impressive sets. The sombre tone is very effective, and Professor Rheinhart comes across very well. However, in my view the stilted dialogue and wooden performances by the other actors (and robots) come close to spoiling it. I tend to watch it with an ear closed to most of the talking.<br />These films are unique of course, and it's good to know they're better preserved now.
0805066691|5.0|As a traveller from N.Ireland who visited the &quot;great plains&quot; this year, including several of the battle sites mentioned in the book, my only regret about my trip was that I hadn't read this work, before my visit.  Having recently begun a study of the Native American people and history, I believe that this book may possibly be the best starting place for such search.  The story of the white conquest of the &quot;wild west&quot; has never had so much meaning for me and the Indian viewpoint and perspective has opened up a whole new way for me, of looking at the anthropology of the USA.  In short, it's a &quot;must&quot; and a darn easy read too.<br />  In conclusion, I'd have to recommend that anyone wishing to investigate the truth of the clash of cultures and the real history of the formation of the USA, should make this a top priority.  Furthermore, anyone planning a trip to take in the history of the &quot;wild west&quot; must, just gotta, read this first, I wish I had.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Like many hyped-up movies, I didn't go to see it on release because the hysteria generated around it was going to make it difficult to enjoy properly, if enjoyable it was.<br />I got the DVD as a Christmas present, so I got to watch it with an open mind, not having paid for it.<br />The animation is lush and colourful, especially the scenes in sunlight, which make you feel like going there for a little break (especially when you're in Scotland in the wintertime!)<br />Shrek's Scottish accent is fairly well done but of course I couldn't say exactly what part of Scotland he's from.<br />My criticisms are of the plot, which I find too predictable, and also the motivations of the villain weren't very well explained - maybe they can't be - WHY does Farquad want the fairytale characters locked up? For a &quot;clean&quot; world?? This makes me slip gears and lose speed, though the quality of the animation carries it along alright.<br />The toilet jokes do go along with the ogre/swamp theme, so are appropriate.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This CD is more than I could have imagined.<br />Being the sentimentalist that I am, this CD touched<BR>my very soul.  I can't say any of these cuts are better<BR>than the others.  They're all so melancholy and smooth.<br />When I listen to this CD, I sit in an easy chair, sip<BR>on a fine, dry, burgandy, and get lost.  Most beautiful<BR>music!
0671027573|4.0|This is my first Linda Howard, and I have to say, I am disappointed.  I freely admit this is my own fault, my expectations were way off.  I read all of the reviews, and was expecting a romance novel.  <br />When I read romance, I look for a fantasy.  I want dialog between the hero &amp; heroine that is inspiring and makes me want to fall in love too.  I want to know about the 2 main character's past and what draws them together and more than anything else; I want a reason to BELIEVE that these 2 people will have a happily ever-after ending.  What I got was a mystery novel.  Granted this mystery has some hot sex and interesting characters, with funny dialogue, but it is still a mystery.  <br />Janie has a group of friends who while enjoying drinks with the girls, stir the interest of a killer.  When things start to get dangerous, Jannie seeks the help of her next door neighbor, Sam the cop.   <br />The story is captivating and held my interest.  Overall the book is a very good read; it just was not the romantic novel that I was expecting.
B00005QAPH|3.0|It is oportune to mention that Criteron does not always produce excellent products but this one deserves 5 stars. However after watching the film this one just isn't as good as the average of the people says. Some day I going to watch it again and compare my thoughts.<BR>2 1/2 is ok because of the excellent transfer quality that makes the film viewable.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I suppose that I probably carry a little bit of prejudice to this album.  It just so happens that I had encountered Cibo Matto before this album, and I have recently discovered that I'm partial to Del tha Funkee Homosapien, so it's probably pretty safe to assume that I'd like a collaboration between all these individuals.  Fortunately, I don't think that my take on this album is all attributable to my personal lean.<br />Gorillaz is probably the most interesting new major market release that I've heard in a long time, which is a welcome event in the overproduced, bulk music environment of today.  While I hate the concept of the album (postmodernism is a beast that should never have reared its ugly head in philosophical circles, and expanding the notion to music is just offensive), the music is superb.  I won't try to categorize the songs on this album, essentially because that'd be quite a trick to perform.  Clint Eastwood (and all the other tracks where Del plays a major role, for that matter) play with various mixtures of hip hop, while Latin Simone sounds like a remix of something off Buena Vista Social Club.<br />Ultimately, there should be something on this album for everybody, regardless of their peculiar interest, and I'd venture a guess that most people will be able to enjoy the music here.  Cartoon character bands don't have the best history (Alvin and the Chipmunks anyone?), but maybe Gorillaz can turn that trend around.  Collaborative efforts like this aren't famous for lasting, but as long as they're here, Gorillaz can offer just about anybody something to listen to.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I wasn't into UFO during their heyday, even though I'm 41 and both could and SHOULD have been.<br />Where the heck was I in 1978?!?!?<br />When Strangers in the Night was recorded (1978), I was 18 and fully alert. Yet, I don't even remember UFO touring in Michigan. They simply weren't on my radar screen. (I know there's a joke about UFOs not being on my radar screen in there somewhere, but I don't know where it is off hand; maybe I've been watching too much X Files lately...)<br />Perhaps in 1978 I was so into groups like Rush, Kansas, Yes, Genesis and Angel that I was a musical snob to anything that didn't seem deep and progressive. In other words, straight ahead rock and roll bands just weren't flipping my switches. (Of course, in my defense, disco was starting to rear its ugly head about that time and managed to kill off entire radio stations and drive many rock bands into hiding.)<br />Thanks to a dearth of great, melodic, well-played, distinctive music available these days, I've spent a lot of time re-discovering lost masterpieces. <br />Like Strangers in the Night from UFO, for instance.<br />I've gotten into UFO in a big way during the past 6-8 months. I started small (with Essential UFO and Lights Out), but quickly built up steam to acquire Walk on Water (a classic!), Strangers in the Night, The Best of the Rest and -- get this -- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR NEWLY REMASTERED CLASSSIC CDS AVAILABLE VIA AMAZON.<br />And why have I done that? Because, quite simply, UFO is magic. And nowhere is this more evident than on Strangers in the Night, their 1978 live album featuring all of their very best classic tracks from the Schenker-era '70s.<br />This Remastered, &quot;Expanded&quot; CD version of Strangers in the Night includes two tracks (&quot;Hot 'N' Ready&quot; and &quot;Cherry&quot;) previously omitted from earlier version of this album. (And previously only available on the expensive Japanese import; so now you don't need to buy that.)<br />My favorite tracksfrom Strangers in the Night include &quot;Cherry,&quot; &quot;Love to Love&quot; (one of my all-time favorite songs from ANY band!), &quot;Out in the Street,&quot; &quot;Mother Mary,&quot; &quot;This Kids,&quot; &quot;Doctor Doctor,&quot; &quot;Lights Out,&quot; &quot;Rock Bottom,&quot; and &quot;Too Hot to Handle.&quot; Which is just about every track on this CD.<br />If you're a fan of melodic hard rock, featuring one of today's most impressive guitarists (Michael Schenker, still WAY too ego-centric for his own good) and distinctive vocalists (Phil Mogg) and a ton of catchy, clever tunes, then UFO should be in your CD collection. And you could easily start with Strangers in the Night as your first purchase.<br />There are a few bands I regret like crazy not seeing when I was a teenager. Angel and UFO are two of them.<br />But, thanks to the miracle of remastered CDs, and vibrant, brilliant performances like those found on Strangers in the Night, I can now pretend I was there. <br />Front row center, of course. :)
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay waltz onto the music scene with Parachutes, an intense and introspective album that is reminescent of Radiohead mixed with Pearl Jam.  The high-energy love song Yellow will blow you away; the lesser known songs provide a strong and breath-taking backdrop for the popular singles.  Get this album as soon as possible if you like brit-rock; hell, get it if you like MUSIC at all.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I purchased this both for my young kids and for my wife, who had never seen the whole movie.  Well, that was a win from the get-go, but the real icing is how well the DVD is stocked with extra features.  Disney did an excellent job transferring this classic to the DVD format, but they didn't stop there; filled with witty and charming bonus features, just having this film on DVD is an experience in itself.  This is a DVD that could make believers of those who have considered moving from videotape to digital video but needed something to convince them.  If only you could edit Michael Eisner out of the small introduction to Barbra Streisand's version of &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; it would be perfect.
B00005JKT8|4.0|Guys, read the title. Women will enjoy this movie, because it is romantic, and has Meg Ryan (The Queen of the chick flick), and is downright &quot;cute&quot; in its entirety. Thrown in for good measure is newcomer Aussie Hugh Jackman (X-men's Wolverine and a top  contender for James Bond after Pierce Brosnan retires) as romantic lead Leopold, a real life duke from the 18th Century. <br />This movie will keep guys interested too. Though romance is the key element here, there are doses of comedy, physical comedy, and science fiction. Leopold is from another time, brought here (ironically) by Kate's ex-boyfriend, who happens to be a genius inventor. Their is no time machine here to bog down the story. Time travel is broken down as a simple theory and is beautifully handled here. <br />Supporting cast including Myer Breckman (Rat Race) as Kate's hilarious actor-brother who thinks Leopold is a method actor who just won't break character, Leiv Schreiber (Phantoms/Scream 2-3)as Meg's ex-boyfriend, and film veteran Phil Bosco in a deliciously understated cameo as Leopold's trusted servant Otis, all turn in strong performances. <br />A great couples film with mass appeal.<BR>  <BR>Keep your eye on Hugh Jackman. This guy really is the next Mel Gibson.
B000002WYT|5.0|I got this CD for Christmas, and once I started listening, I couldn't stop. It's still in my CD player and isn't leaving any time soon. Dave Matthews Band has never been a band to disappoint, even though it's quite different from most bands that are popular today, between the violin, saxaphone, and many other instruments and styles. Some of the best songs are Too Much and So Much To Say, but I really love Say Goodbye, it's just a beautiful melody. Crash is also a great ballad-like song, and always reminds me of a certain friend. I would definitely recommend spending the $.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Yes, we know. EVERYONE has been listening to Incubus since &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; and everyone is their number one fan, but that's not really important. What IS important is that &quot;Morning View&quot; is probably the best rock album released in 2001. <br />For my money, Incubus is the most original rock band since the grunge era of the early 90s. And originality counts these days, considering every new rock band sounds like an offshoot of Korn, LimpBizkit, or the rest of all the rap-rock groups that have come out of the woodwork. &quot;Morning View&quot; is just a shining example of the creativity Incubus has and virtually every other band lacks. It's an album that is not only unique compared to the rest of contemporary rock, but unique with the beginning of each track. They experiment with new sounds consistently throughout the record to achieve a tapestry of music that is downright daring.<br />The best element of Incubus's musical magic, however, is Brandon Boyd's vocal poeticism and knack for imagery. Whether he's describing an isolated beach or an apartment bedroom, the setting is embedded in your mind's eye as the song plays. And he has no particular need for making his lines rhyme, which gives him a freedom of expression most songwriters deny themselves. The result is a body of lyrics that match the melodies so well, it sounds like the words were written first.<br />The combination of refreshing riffs and Boyd's imaginative libretto makes for a completely satisfying listening experience. For those of us longing for something a little different, &quot;Morning View&quot; is an unexpected treat. In fact, I'd venture to say if rock music were candy, Incubus is the new Willy Wonka.
B00005RYKU|5.0|Ever since I first saw THE GLASS HOUSE at my local cinema, I have grown a new appreciation for suspense movies. I see how everything is important in making the audience scared (the atmosphere, the lighting, the music, etc.). It certainly is an entertaining and scary movie, and now it has a great DVD edition to go with it.<br />Honestly, you couldn't have picked a better cast. As she has proved many times, Leelee Sobieski is one of the best young actresses in the biz. Diane Lane &amp; Stellan Skarsgård are great as the ruthless Glasses. Trevor Morgan is fun as Rhett, Sobieski's brother in the film. There are also several amusing appearances by Bruce Dern, Kathy Baker, Chris Noth, Michael O'Keefe, and Rita Wilson (who, for some reason, is not billed in the credits).<br />Daniel Sackheim (director), Alar Kivilo (d.o.p.), and Christopher Young (composer), as well as the cast &amp; the rest of the creative/productive staff, all worked very hard to make THE GLASS HOUSE an intriguing, suspenseful, and beautifully-made thriller.<br />DVD Special Features: director and writer commentary, deleted scenes, exclusive filmmaker interviews, trailers, filmographies, production notes, and scene selections.
B00005U122|5.0|Brilliant picture. Unbeatable sound quality. Great performance. What more could you want from a concert DVD? Oh, I got something: Roger Waters visuals. I saw the Pro's/Cons tour (the second one without Clapton) and Radio KAOS tour, which were beautifully supplemented by a triple screen presentation of visual effects. I haven't seen Reg since then. And from the DVD I wouldn't really be able to tell what he had going on behind him because the camera was constantly focusing on the audience (thanks for showing me the fat woman in the white pullover 15 times!), people I don't know. That's the only fault I can come up with and it's not worth kicking off a whole star, because really, I've got to say that this DVD is fantastic!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Lasse Hallstrom has a magical, deft touch with his films -- the stories are clear and the tone is often mystical in some fashion or another. CHOCOLAT is a lovely example of this, moving from the &quot;Once upon a time&quot; opening to entrancing and seductively charming the viewer into caring for all the characters, even the difficult ones. Each character is, in my opinion, beautifully and caringly cast, and each turns in lovely, nuanced performances. Notable are Lena Olin, Alfred Molina and, of course, Judi Dench. Both Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp are marvellous as well; Depp's character Roux has depth as well as surface charm. The location in southern France is gorgeous; makes you want to live there, too. Have some chocolate nearby as you watch! The cooking scenes will make you crave it!<br />Oh, and by the way, the DVD version of this film is very lovely.  They have a couple of documentaries about the making of the film that are almost as charming and interesting as the film itself.  Good stuff.
068484267X|4.0|The memoir &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a compelling life-story of the author, told in colorful (or drab, as the case often is), witty and refined descriptions.  McCourt offers insightful, painful and clever excerpts of his life growing up in Ireland.  The book is both depressing and uplifting at the same time.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I'm not much of a Russell Crowe fan, but went to see this movie because I had heard so many good things about it.  I knew this movie was a true story about a brilliant man, but I didn't know anymore than that.  I instantly got sucked into the story, which made the movie so enjoyable.  I laughed, I cried, and I felt every emotion in between.  I have recommended this movie to everyone I know.
B00005RYQO|5.0|Oh my god this movie was the bomb!! A total guy movie though. This movie hit the spot when it comes to action, especially the racing scenes. Anyway wait for this to come out and buy it and really get a bargain.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I took my nephew to see this movie.  What a piece of garbage.  I thought it was bad seeing all these little twits driving around the cities in their rug burners, but now they make a movie about them.<br />Unless your under 18, don't rent, buy or borrow this movie.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'm not a Britney fanatic, but I do like her. I thought this CD would [stink]..., but it turned out to be REALLY good! It took awhile to really get use to all the songs. If you like upbeat songs, this is the CD for you.  There's only 2 ballads in this CD: \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" and \\"That's Where You Take Me.\\"<br />My favorite has to be \\"Bombastic Love\\" and \\"Cinderella.\\" They both have a nice beat to it.<br />\\"Anticipation\\" reminds me of Bewitched's \\"C'est La Vie.\\"  I wonder if she stole the rhythm to that song.  <br />Anyway, just buy the CD, you'll love it!

Granted, the remix on the second dvd isn't here...This is still a fantastic cd with memories of the movie for you to cherish and relive over and over.<BR>There has been a loss of the movie musical in the last 20 years and this has taken a lot of the loss and put it into an amazing story of love.<BR>First, Nicole Kidman...her voice is light and easy to listen to and her sweet sound is complimented highly in &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot;, &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; and &quot;Come What May&quot;.<BR>Next, Ewan McGregor...his voice is fantastic...who knew?  &quot;Your Song&quot; shines as his moment in this movie that will make anyone fall instantly in love with him.  &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; and &quot;Come What May&quot; showcase his talent of harmonizing.  Bravo, Ewan!<BR>Lastly, the song &quot;Come What May&quot; is probably one of the best love songs I have heard in years.  The dance remix is outstanding and if you get the dvd, you can listen to it.  Fantastic song!  <BR>All in all, a good cd with a lot of songs that remind the listener of a fantastic movie.<BR>Too bad that they skipped a lot of them in the process of making the cd, but here is hoping that there will be a companion cd to go along with the movie...soon!
0156528207|5.0|I have lost count over how many times I've read this book.

B000002E5J|5.0|I've been a fan of Shakira since 1995, and out of all her albums &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; is the one that means the most. Her beautiful lyrics reach to the very soul as she sings about times in a teenage girl's life when the transition from childhood to adulthood is difficult. Songs like &quot;Se Quiere, Se Mata&quot; about abortion, and &quot;Pies Descalzos, Suenos Blancos&quot; about women's rights are not only beautiful they are poignant. I urge people who love good music with a message to buy her albums. COLOMBIA TE AMO!!!! Thank you for showing the rest of the world how beautiful Colombia is.
B00000IUP4|5.0|We received this engine in a starter set about a year ago.  It worked fine for a while.  Later it would only work in reverse, and then a few days ago in quit working all together.  I think my 2-year-old daughter stood on it, and messed up the internal gears.  Knowing it was probably my daughters fault I didn't think the warranty would cover it.  I went to the toy store with a year old broken toy, no receipt, and no box.  Needless to say I fully expected to buy a new engine.  To my amazement the toy store didn't ask any questions or have me fill out any paperwork.  They just handed me a new engine, and that was it.  Brio may be expensive, but I think a no questions asked return policy is worth the money you spend on Brio Trains.

B000053V7Q|5.0|I just got this DVD at Christmas time and it was the first audio or video recording of Elvis that I have ever owned... or even sat and watched or listened to.  The Elvis mythology is obviously deeply ingrained in our culture and you feel like you know a lot about the King, but I was surprised about how I felt like I was watching something I had never seen before.<br />About the movie:  I have to think that this is the best concert footage that exists anywhere of the King.  And I like how it starts out with the &quot;behind the scenes footage&quot; that builds up to the concert.  You really get to see the human side of Elvis and I really liked the guy.  You get the feeling that he always goofed around but movie-producing types back in those days didn't like to show it.  The concert footage is amazing.  Elvis seems on top of his game and his voice is amazing.<br />About the DVD:  I have heard a few comments about the audio not being that great, but I thought that it was fine.  It is at least as good as anything else that was filmed in 1970.  I have also read that some people didn't like how the film was re-worked since it first came out.  I didn't see the original version, but I am not to interested in watching interviews with Elvis-fans, I wanted to see the King himself, doing what he did best.  The Patch It Up documentary was fine, it didn't really add a lot - I think that documentaries about documentaries are never going to add much.<br />If I have one complaint about the movie and DVD, it is that they were too short.  I would have liked it to be longer - maybe by about 3-4 more songs.<br />This will sound corny, but this DVD alone has really turned me into an Elvis fan.  I have gone from not knowing or caring much about him, to wanting to know a lot in less than 2 weeks.  I enjoyed the music and singing, but I guess that is what I expected.  What I didn't expect is to find out how normal Elvis seemed back stage and what a great entertainer he was on stage.  I think that he was the King because he was the King of crowd pleasing.<br />The last thing I want to say is that this movie led me to purchase the '68 Comeback Special and Aloha from Hawaii DVDs.  I have only watched them each once, but my initial impression is that I am disappointed.  The '68 Comeback Special seems too hokey and tries to cover too many genres of music - psychadelic, gospel, etc.  In Aloha from Hawaii, Elvis seems too subdued.  Those two DVDs show the Elvis that I was expecting to see before I watched That's The Way It Is.  Any way, I will have to review those DVDs separately after I have watched them a few more times.  My point in bringing them up here is to say that, by comparison, That's The Way It Is is MUCH better and if you are like I was - you are kind of interested in Elvis and you want to see him at his best - you should start by buying this DVD.<br />Jeremy
0066620996|5.0|As you read the book, you realize (again!)how simple you can turn trully important things when you master something, as Collins does in this easy reading book. A lot of people will be shocked by the facts that appear in the book.....a lot of mediocre people. This is a &quot;level 5 must read&quot; masterpiece for everyone who wants to try his best, in any discipline (Im an Orthopaedic Surgeon myself).
B000002E5J|5.0|I've been a fan of Shakira since 1995, and out of all her albums &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; is the one that means the most. Her beautiful lyrics reach to the very soul as she sings about times in a teenage girl's life when the transition from childhood to adulthood is difficult. Songs like &quot;Se Quiere, Se Mata&quot; about abortion, and &quot;Pies Descalzos, Suenos Blancos&quot; about women's rights are not only beautiful they are poignant. I urge people who love good music with a message to buy her albums. COLOMBIA TE AMO!!!! Thank you for showing the rest of the world how beautiful Colombia is.

0060930349|5.0|This is one of the definitive works on American history.  It goes much deeper than other general American history books by exploring not just events, but the mindsets of the people making the history.  This makes the book not only informative, but interesting and provocative.  It shows that our history is much more than just dates, facts and figures.  I'd highly recommend this for anyone who wants to gain a much deeper understanding of how this country evolved into what it is today.
B00005QEO2|5.0|Excellent 2 disc set from a time in Aerosmith's career that may have been short, but cant be denied and the 2 disc format fits perfectly.  More balanced than Big Ones, (you get all of that disc plus so much more), Young Lust updates the Geffen era with better sound, more songs and great cover art.
B00005OB0A|5.0|the best album of 2001! kylie is the true queen of pop. this is the best electro/disco romp in ages! for starters you have the infectious 'can't get you out of my head', the subtle 'fragile', the saucy 'more, more, more', the thumping 'in your eyes' and my personal fave 'love at first sight.' kylie always outdoes herself. ever since 1994's 'kylie minogue' she has just released some of the most amazing material of her career. and would u believe this album is actually going to see the light of day in the us!??!! don't pass this one up. catch the fever...
B00005K3LW|5.0|Die Hard 3: With a Vengeance, is the second best of the Trilogy.  This movie shows McClane as an even more flawed individual then the first.  He is having problems with his wife again (who we unfortunately never see), he is back in New York, on suspension, fighting alcoholism as well as a new set of criminals who seem to have it out for him from the beginning.  This movie is as clever as the first in its own way.  The more you watch it, the more you discover.  Once again, you have McClane fighting against terrorists, this time we find out there is a connection to the first movie, this is not a random terrorist act.  McClane is forced to pair up with Zeus, a semi-racial Harlem store owner.  Zeus helps McClane at the beginning and from there on, they are forced to travel through New York together as they are constantly toyed with by the nemesis of the movie, this time played by Jeremy Irons.  Once again, McClane must use his wits, as well as his toughness, to get through the day.  The racial tensions that come up between McClane and Zeus are very believable and show aspects of both sides.  This movie was directed by John McTiernan, the same man who directed the first one.  His skill with direction is made obvious with his balance of action and emotion, although not so much as the first one.  The claustrophobia of the building created a greater tension in the first movie, whereas this one takes place all over New York city.  It lends to giving this movie it's own style and helping it seperate itself from the first one, but something still gets lost.  Don't fret though, this is still a great film with great action and truely clever moments.<br />With the extras that are included in the Special Editions and the Five Star Collectors pack, any fan of all three movies would not hesitate to buy it.  If you don't feel you should have all three, at least buy the first movie, it is definitely worth it and may get you to spring for the other two, or at least the third.<br />\\"Welcome to the party pal!\\"
0446608955|2.0|This is a good book to pick up if you're on your way to a long plane flight, a week of sunning on the beach, or an extended time on the throne. It's a fairly quick read, with no deep concepts to grasp or difficult vocabulary. (Which sometimes, I must admit, is exactly what I need. Kind-of like the book version of the musical CATS.)<br />If you want to ponder something, though, and figure it out, and wonder what the characters might do next, don't pick this book up. I'd say it's strictly lazy summer reading.
0399143904|3.0|I would have prefered to see a larger portion of the book describing more missions for Rainbow rather than pages of tripping through the amoral mind of eco-nuts.<br />If there are two weaknesses in Clancy's writing style they are (1) long, monotonous sections describing technology in painful, excruciating detail, and (2) long, monotonous sections describing personal thoughts in painful, excruciating detail.<br />If you're looking for anti-terrorism Marcinko style, stick with Dick.  If you're looking for Marcinko meets The Sum of All Fears, this is your book.
0345413377|5.0|This book was the best book in the series and the best series i have ever read in my entire lifetime... The religious and political aspects are there. I can see it and quite frankly it is those viewpionts and opinions that make this book special. The opinions are not pressed on the readers and they are not at all extreme. Most, if not all, of the younger children who will read this book will not understand the subtle political and religious aspects. Those who do see it will be smart enough to make their own conclusions and make what they will of it. There is one very strong religious point of view, I must admit. The book seems terribly anti-God. But those who read it must understand that these people are doing evil things behind the name of God and all he stands for. They say they represent God and all of his glory. This is not new and even looking back on the history of our world, there were horrible things that the church did in the name of God. Even today people are killed in the name of divine figures. This is the truth and everyone should see and know the truth, especially young readers. <br />    On the positive side, this book is phenomenal. Its two predecessors were exceptional and the ending was no disappointment at all. I refuse to give away important information, but just to let you know, you will cry. I cried throughout nearly the entire ending of the book. It was sad, yes, if that's what you're thinking. But even more so, it was a more beautiful and bittersweet ending that has yet to be bested by any book. The description and ideas are there. The drama and suspense are there. The emotion is there. The closure is there. The feeling afterwards of postivity is there.  <BR>    The love diplayed is ungodly strong, so pure and so unreal.<br />    This book holds so much emotion. solace, peace, love, hatred, sadness, loneliness, and hope. You will finish this book and the series a different person.
B00005K3LU|5.0|\\"Yippie Kye Aye Mutha...\\" Well, any fan would know the rest.  If you don't know the rest, and you like good solid action movies, then you need to buy this Five star collection.  Now before you blow this movie off as a mindless violent movie, let it be known that Die Hard was the action flick that changed everything.  Before this one, actions films usually had heroes who were all muscle and no emotion.  Bruce Willis comes off in this movie as an everyday guy.  Yes, he's a cop, and a smart cop, but it is his portrayal as a troubled husband and father with marriage problems that really hits home.  He's not perfect.  He's stubborn and unobjectionable, and that helps us relate.<br />Willis plays John McClane, a New York detective who travels to California to visit his wife at her company Christmas party.  She has moved out there to successfully pursue her career, an idea that an old school Irish cop such as himself is probably not used.  He comes from a family who is most likely holding to values that the wife should be taking care of the kids and not working for a multi-million dollar company.  McClane is not against her working, but he probably holds reservations about it.  They are separated, but it is obvious they miss each other, too.  In a turn of events a group of `terrorists' take control of the building where the party is taking place.  The lead terrorist is played by Alan Rickman, also changing the role of the villain for all time as well.  Rickman plays Hans Gruber, a smart, slick and highly intelligent criminal who does not gloat with evil laughter.  He is single minded and professional.  What happens afterward is a sharp game of cat and mouse as Gruber tries to figure out who this monkey wrench in the works is and McClane gathers information about the terrorists and tries to get help from the outside.  Interestingly, his first ideas are to get help, not take everyone on all by himself.  He constantly stays on his toes and the title of the movie becomes veryapparent as McClane takes injury after injury but keeps going.  Add in some humor, some emotional conversations between McClane and a beat cop who he contacts outside the building, and some moments where the fear in Willis' character become very clear, and you get a movie that is so well rounded and entertaining, it's no wonder it's a classic.  Enough said, buy it.<br />By the way, I say it's a guys Christmas movie only because it takes place at Christmas time.
B00005R2IS|4.0|I saw this movie when i was a kid and loved it.  I still like it as an adult, but the dubbed dialogue takes alot away from it.  Hearing the original Aussie accents take this to a new dimension.  Very Cool!
0316776963|1.0|I received this book and, given all the positive publicity, was anxious and excited to read it. However, I put it down after struggling through half of it, vowing not to finish it. Why? Because hidden beneath Sedaris' sarcastic, cynical approach to humor appears to be a bitterness against people, the world - life in general. Sure, if you like laughing at others, I suppose you would enjoy this book. He reminds me of a cynical, sarcastic Woody Allen. Using humor to basically say &quot;See how smart I am? I'm making fun of YOU, the AVERAGE person, and you don't even know it!&quot;. Bitterness is not funny - it's just plain ugly.
B000002GGU|5.0|When I bought this record, I was looking for the Bryan Adams duet with Tina Turner &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; but as I listened to the rest of it, I found an album that was so great, I'd think a Greatest Hits album should be called something like &quot;Reckless +3&quot; because Reckless had so many songs that became staples of Top 40 radio. <br />&quot;One Night Love Affair,&quot; &quot;Run to You,&quot; with its driving guitars, &quot;Somebody,&quot; and &quot;Summer of '69&quot; themselves would each make great reasons to buy the album. But put the whole package together, and you get a rarity of recent music: An album that you can play straight through without skipping songs.
B00005JKT8|4.0|Gave it 4 stars for the male actors in this movie.  They really did a superb job!  Meg Ryan was fairly bad in this movie.  definitely worth seeing at some point.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I watched the movie. I'm glad I saw it, but it's a hard one to recommend... because it's different. I liked the story, although I'm not a huge fan of musicals, this one flowed nicely with the story. AND THE MUSIC, well, it was WONDERFUL! I rewound the tape and listened to Ewan McGregor sing &quot;Your Song&quot; 3 times. It gave me goose bumps to hear it in the movie and that is why I bought the CD. If you liked the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. I can see the scenes of the movie as I listen to this soundtrack. Nicole &amp; Ewan do great on &quot;Come What May.&quot;  &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; is also good. See the movie.... relive it on CD.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i came across John on accident and I'm glad that I did. This is the most amazing cd. I listen to it constantly. I would reccomend it to anyone. Go out and buy it and you will most definately love it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is one of those CD's that creeps into your life.  The first time you play it you don't realize your fingers are tapping along.  You are oblivious to your humming on only the second time its in your stereo.  This CD is infectious: you'll  find yourself singing outloud whether the CD is playing or not. Go ahead and by a few copies of Room for Squares, you'll want one by you desk, in you car, by your bed, in you walkman, in your living room...
0679428887|3.0|I'll cut to the chase here....<br />This books starts out great and Harris paints an accurate and strong portrayal of modern day Russia. He also does a pretty good job from a historical perspective when dealing with Stalin. This novel could have been excellent had a different approach been taken and had the plot not taken a turn for the worse. Towards th end the book really goes downhill and ends up borderline ridiculous. Had a more subtle and realistic approach been taken by Harris, it would have made the read much more enjoyable for me. For the first 250 pages I was hooked and that's why I am giving it three stars.
B00003CXAA|5.0|These movies are Beautiful. Pure, pefect art. Great Music also.
0380973650|3.0|I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan and enjoyed this novel, but after reading his earlier novels, short stories, Sandman and other works I found that this novel often walked over ground he's covered better elsewhere. Some of Gaiman's vignettes work better in the context of a serial (such as Sandman) than a novel.<br />Much of this novel reads like a road diary of a foreign traveller visiting the US for the first time. Most of the conversations are in cars, airports, motels and fast food joints. If you like travelogs you'll like this book, but after a while you feel like you've been travelling for a very long time without actually getting anywhere.<br />The novel is divided into three main sections. The setup is excellent. Gaiman is one of the best at drawing a reader in. The second section remains entertaining but Gaiman's interest seems to wander and he throws in several stand-alone pieces that might have worked better as short stories as they don't effectively advance the plot and instead disrupt any sense of suspense that might have been building.<br />The final section ties up most of the loose ends but a bit too abruptly and neatly. Again, it seemed like Gaiman was losing interest or being pressured by his publisher to wrap this up and get on with it. Granted, it is difficult to offer much closure in a world where death has very little sense of finality.<br />Given a tighter focus and more aggressive editing this novel might have worked better. Gaiman is capable of working at a higher intellectual and emotional level than he presents here. To experience Gaiman at the height of his powers read &quot;Stardust&quot; (the original edition illustrated by Charles Vess) or the Sandman series. Still, his prose is a delight to read and his sense of whimsy is delightful. I look forward to reading Neil Gaiman as he matures as a novelist.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Visually brilliant throughout, wonderful eye candy. Every other aspect of this film is shockingly bad. Several scenes were laugh out loud awful. The 1st disc has several nice features. The 2nd disc never entered the player. I forced myself to finish the film and almost stopped several times. I was pulled along just to see how much worse it could get and was not denied.
B00005Q66T|4.0|There's nothing new or exciting here.  If you like madonna then you'll like this because you probably own all the songs anyway.  However, some of the bigger hits are replaced by lesser hits but the lesser hits are bigger crowd pleasers (I was so excited to see the inclusion of the bjork penned 'bedtime stories', one of my favortite madonna tracks). So no disappointments there.  The liner notes are cool but we've all seen the pictures many, many times before. <br />I think this could have benefited greatly if: <BR>A)some or all the tracks were remixes<BR>B)all the tracks were continuously mixed or<BR>C)there were at least one or two brand new tracks<br />In any case it's madonna so you know what to expect.  Buy this only if you're a madonna completist and MUST own EVERYTHING that she releases or if you're new to madonna (is that possible???).  Odds are you either own everything on this disc or you already have the singles you like from this release.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Pixar knows what they're doing. They have created yet another unforgettable picture. Toy Story 2 - well, I want to say it's better than the first, but out of sentiment I can't. The script is hilarious to adults and children. You know, you'll laugh because you get the joke, then kids will laugh because you're laughing. It's a funny, touching and remarkable piece of work.
B00005JKMO|2.0|Aside from a few wonderful performances by supporting players (that warranted the 2 star rating), namely John Voight, Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles, this is a very boring flick.  The film is too long and the cuts are way too quick in a lot of instances.  But, isn't that the case of the movies nowadays.  Everything is filmed and edited like a music video these days.  Just cause that kind of thing works on television doesn't mean an audience wants to sit though that much assault on the senses.  Plus Will Smith was the same variation on almost every character he plays except with a bad Ali impersonation.
B00005JKHP|1.0|First of all I am a trekkie, and I owned all the Star Trek Movies on VHS through Generations at which time I stopped waiting for their DVD release.  I eagerly awaited the Director's cut first movie.  Now there is the rub, how many Directors' cuts actually are shorter than previously released versions.  This edition has deleted the 11 scenes inserted in the enhanced VHS version, sure you get them and other deleted scenes on the second DVD, big deal, I want them in the movie.  You get the impression the Director never wanted the scenes after all it is his cut.  Unfortunately, those scenes are important in explaining about Deltas and Decker's relationship with the navigation officer.  The improved special effects were nice, but to be honest its been 10 years since I had sat down to watch the original version and I had to go back to find the improvements.  If I had only seen the original unenhanced version, I would give it 4 out of 5.  However, I enjoyed the enhanced version and feel cheated by the deletion of all those scenes, so a charitable 1 of 5 is more than it deserves.  I give it this because the DVD version is supposed to be special and to me this does not mean put the extras outside of the movie, put them in where the director originally had intended.  There is a growing trend where studios now put the wide-screen and pan and scan versions on sale separately, where they both were on the same DVD before.  If this trend continues, it could turn many of us off.
068484267X|4.0|Wow! What a book. Omitting the fact that the lack of quotation marks made the reading slightly more difficult than usual, this novel was one of the best I have ever read. Upon finishing this, I immediately seized 'Tis, the second book of Frank McCourt's life. The two books take you through a detailed recount of the author's life as an Irish-American immigrant, including many of the humorous tidbits experienced throughout his life, his views on women, work, teaching, and school. If you buy this book, you must also read 'Tis. I recommend it highly.
B000003TAL|5.0|This is one of them there top ten desert island albums.  The whole angst and joy of classic Americano punk wrapped up into one noise party.  If your tastes run harder than Mariah Carey, you gotta gotta get this.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I'm a big fan of electronic music - Depeche Mode is my all time favorite band.  So if I want to listen to electronic music, I reach for them first.  I never thought I'd have to put No Doubt in the electronic music category of my music collection!  What did the other members of the band do on this album, sit around twiddling their thumbs?  <br />I own all of No Doubt's previous albums because they rock!  Or should I say &quot;rocked&quot;.  I've always admired Gwen especially, because she's one of the few women in current, popular music today that really rocks.  But if they keep heading in this direction, there will be no more women rocking on MTV anymore, just rap and pop music acts.  I was really disappointed when I saw the ad for Rock Steady on CDnow.  It said &quot;Goodbye Ska, Hello Hip Hop&quot;.  How can No Doubt just abandon their sound of 15 years so easily?  Is it all in the name of record sales or jumping on the hip hop bandwagon to acquire more fans?  Maybe Gwen is feeling threatened by the four or five Britney Spears clones floating around the air waves these days.<br />Rock Steady is fun in some areas, but for the most part it is over produced and over programmed.  Half a dozen or more producers gives the album a &quot;too many fingers in the pie&quot; feeling.  True fans of their original sound will be disappointed.  I hope they return to form on their next outing.
0736041850|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone intersted in their body.  The illustrations are excellent.  They show exactly what muscles are used in what exercises.  You can zone in on a problem area or make certain you are covering all bases with this book.  I'm buying two more for friends.  I've been looking for this for so long!
0312243022|4.0|This book was very enjoyable.  Easy enough to read in one long evening, or as I did in bits and pieces over three days.  Cunningham does a wonderful job weaving three plots together to create a very complete work of fiction.  The subject matter was contemporary, yet built an interesting bridge to the early 20th century at the same time.  Years from now I will probably have to read this one again to bring back the richness of all of the characters, this isn't one that will stick with you for a lifetime, but it sure was enjoyable and very worthy of 4 stars.
B00000JCOV|2.0|Like GWAR, KISS, and Marilyn Manson, Slipknot is yet another band which prefers style/trend over musical quality. The trend of Slipknot is that their fans are &quot;maggots&quot; and anyone who doesn't like them is gay. (Of course, their fans repeat this). What the heck does &quot;Sicness&quot; supposed to mean? See, just a trend. Boring.<br /> I would like to note that Slipknot is NOT a death metal band. While the &quot;vocalist&quot;, drummer, and guitarists try to make it sound like one, it all amounts to nu-metal based on the production and sampling...Here are the three main elements of death metal:<br />1. There is no such thing as gangsta-rap death metal, country death metal, or pop-death metal. Death metal was given its term because it consists of slick but simple production values with little or no mastering. (Although Swedish Death metal bands tend to use organs/keyboards/theatrics, but that commonly turns to the category of &quot;black metal&quot;.) <br />2. The topics are brooding and gratuitous and usually about evil, pain, horror, gore, death, or suffering. There's not a single death metal band about youth alienation.<br />3. The singer *dictates* the lyrics, very loud and very fast, (with a voice that sounds like Darth Vader with strep throat, for comparison). There is never a time when the singer goes back to his/her ordinary voice, raps, or becomes even slightly intelligible.<br />Thus, Slipknot is not death metal. (So please don't call it that, OK?)<br /> The masks do nothing but hide the fact that they lack talent. Even one of the members of Insane Clown Posse brought up the fact that their face paint made them popular. You want a good masked metal band? Get Mr. Bungle's first ST. If you want heavy, get any Slayer, Carcass or Sepultura album, but steer clear of Slipknot. They're the bubblegum pop of today's nu-metal.
B00005RDAF|4.0|&quot;Britney: The Videos&quot; is equal parts satisfying and frustrating.  While it does give us a healthy dose of Britney strutting her stuff, one can't help but feel that this DVD package could have been loaded with so much more.  After the sensational package put together in her previous video and DVD, &quot;Britney Spears: Live and More,&quot; this latest offering is almost a snub.<br />Here are the good things about the DVD: 1) You get three of her actual music videos; one of these is from Britney's second album, and two others are from her third album.  2) You get two commercials that Britney has done; one is her Pepsi commercial, and another is an ad for her HBO special.  3) You get Britney's performance at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards.  4) You get Britney's &quot;Overprotected&quot; video, which features outtakes from her upcoming movie, &quot;Crossroads.&quot;  Incidently, this same feature is also available on her latest music CD.  5) You get Britney posing for a photo shoot.  And 6) You get a behind-the-scenes look at the making of &quot;Crossroads.&quot;<br />Here are the bad things about the DVD: I am very surprised that with all the videos and DVDs out there, not one of them has had Britney's video for &quot;From the Bottom of My Broken Heart.&quot;  I was most definitely anticipating that video to be on this release, but I was disappointed.  Another thing that is troubling is the lack of things that were included on this DVD.  We only got one live performance, for example; you're telling me that the makers of this DVD couldn't have gotten a few more of her performances on here?  What it feels like to me is that the making of this package was rushed.  And what I mean by that is this: somebody thought it'd be a great idea for Britney to come out with a music CD *and* a video/DVD at the same time.  So it was thrown together a little hastily.  &quot;Britney: The Videos&quot; had the potential to be the best offering out of the three &quot;Britney Specials&quot; on the market; however, it only come across as slightly above average.<br />&quot;Britney: The Videos&quot; is a sharp-looking package; there's no denying that.  But it could have been better.  It should have been better.  Die-hard Britney fans will no doubt pick this one up.  But for someone who has done so much growing in her three years in the music business, you would expect that videos/DVDs of Britney would grow as well - not get shorter.ials&quot; on the market; however, it only come across as slightly above average.<br />&quot;Britney: The Videos&quot; is a sharp-looking package; there's no denying that.

B00005JKMO|1.0|If I had know my husband was as bored with this movie as I was, we would have walked out.  Something I have never actually done, but have wanted to.<br />I did think the acting by Will Smith and Jon Voight were outstanding, and they both deserve awards.  I also thought this movie was dragged out.  There are so many unanswered questions for me with this film.<br />I would think coming out of a biographic film that one would have knowledge about the subject. I learned a few things, like how Ali had avoided the draft, and that he knew Malcom X, but the greatest listen learned was that I should've saved that $8.75 and seen &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; twice.<br />I fell asleep twice in this movie as it just wasn't keeping me interested and it was my bedtime after all.<br />This movie did nothing for me, nor my husband. If you are a HUGE fan of Will Smith, you will appreciate it for his acting.  If you are a HUGE Ali fan, you might appreciate. I was just the average film goer, taking a chance.  I do like Will Smith alot, and thought he was amazing in this. Hard to believe this is the same guy who rapped about his parents not understanding and playing &quot;the fresh prince of bel air&quot;.  He has come a long way...
0451528018|4.0|i've read a fair chunk of sherlock holmes's adventures, and i must say, doyle is at his best when he's writing short stories.  although this book has it's merits (it's still classic doyle about classic sherlock holmes) it's too long and doesn't pack the punch of his shorter works.<br />to whom i would recommend this book:  to real sherlock holmes enthusiasts, who have read pretty much everything else by doyle about him and want to finish up the last few still-nutritious table scraps.<br />to whom i would recommend avoiding this book:  pretty much everybody else, but especially those who are new to sherlock holmes.  you'd be much better off reading &quot;the adventures of sherlock holmes,&quot; &quot;the memoirs of sherlock holmes&quot; (though the ending of was weak weak weak!) or &quot;the return of sherlock holmes.&quot;<br />happy reading, and if you happen to stumble upon this book before reading any of the others, don't worry, it's still pretty good!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'm still speechless when it comes to this movie.  Just watch it and you'll see.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I was hugely disappointed with this CD. She keeps moving farther and farther away from her jazz roots. I would have never believed that she would start doing Burt Bachrach tunes with schlocky orchestras arrangements. If you had only heard this CD and none of her earlier releases, you would never guess that Miss Krall is an excellent piano player. In fact, you can barely hear any piano at all. I saw her in concert weeks before the release of this CD and she only played one tune from it. I can see why now.<br />The only positive thing I can say about &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is that she looks smoking hot in the artwork.
B00000634J|5.0|I have long been a Beatles fan, and always liked all of John Lennon's solo efforts as well.  At least the more popular songs like, Imagine, Woman, Watching the Wheels, and Starting Over.<br />Then, while visiting a friend, I saw this compliation.  It is without a doubt one of the best c.d.'s of the compliation category.<br />I didn't hear the whole thing til the day after Christmas, (It was a gift), I am so happy with this c.d.  You usually can't go wrong getting the greatest hits, and this is definitely &quot;the very best of John Lennon&quot; as the cover of the disc states.<br />There were a few songs I didn't know, but with each listening to this c.d., I seem to enjoy the whole thing more and more.  It is a great tribute to the genius called John Lennon.  I believe he is one of the greatest songwriters I have ever had the pleasure to hear.  It's so sad that he had to be taken from us so soon..<br />TO YOU JOHN, You'll live forever through this tribute.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Every now and then music needs a good kick in the rear-end. Nowadays the general public is bombarded with boy-band crud and fred friggin durst and his brand of pseudo rock. The timing behind this release could not be any better. Aside from Radiohead, music isn't very exciting today. Echoes was intended for a broader audience accustomed to TRL and its bland offering.<br />Even the most hypercritical Floyd loyalist can appreciate the fact that a new generation of music lovers are drawn to the sonic beauty of this album. Remember how you felt when you first heard the Dark Side of the Moon?
6305546789|3.0|I was just watching t.v like usually browsed through some horror channels and saw it listed for 9:00, So I bought a video and got ready to tape this. I was expecting alot more from this film. First of all the music in this film was way,waym over-played, anyone can see that and don't say it wasn't, allmost every minute of this film, was that same music time after time, even when someone was just walking down the street! This movie had no gore! I expected alot, and what did I get? Almost nothing! It is a creepy film at times though that's for sure, but the end was very, very stupid. Stop reading if you don't want to know. Myers gets shot several times, yet he still has the power to get up and leave, what is that! He is a human being, not a monster, people need to get that through their heads, this is not Jason Voorhees! Set aside the rest of that it is a creepy flick.
B00005RYQO|1.0|&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is supposed to be about import-car racing.  Import-car racing is a phenomenon started by Asian American auto enthusiasts, and it's still predominantly Asian American today.  Also, this movie was inspired by an article written by an Asian American journalist.  <br />How does &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; pay tribute to the sport's Asian American heritage?  Why, of course, by whitewashing the story with white and Latino main characters and by making every Asian character in the movie either a villainous gangster or a moll.  What a smear job!  Even outright anti-Asian movies like &quot;The Year of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Rising Sun&quot; at least made the pretense of being evenhanded by including some &quot;positive&quot; Asian supporting characters.  &quot;F&amp;F&quot; doesn't even make that puny effort.  <br />Imagine a Hollywood movie about jazz where all of the jazz musicians are white -- where the art form's black heritage is completely ignored -- and where all of the black characters are the irredeemable villains we're supposed to hiss.  Maybe you'll get an idea of just how egregiously anti-Asian &quot;F&amp;F&quot; is.  What's especially disappointing about this movie is that it's directed by Rob Cohen, who also made the laudable &quot;Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story.&quot;
B000002H33|5.0|Every Metal artist has that defining moment where it is just the heaviest thing they've done and also the one that people consider the best, one that's also a fine honing of songwriting.Megadeth has Rust In Peace and Slayer has Reign Of Blood.This is Metallica's.<br />Battery:Just like Ride The Lightning, this album starts with an acoustic passage on guitar with an spanish flavoured rhythm.Then bang, the song kicks in to overdrive into one of the fastest riffs ever.Dimebag Darrell said James Hetfield was the king of downpicking and he's right.<br />Master Of Puppets:The title track and a definite fan favourite.The main riff is a great exercise into downpicking.The track runs for awhile and midway, there's the greatest interlude/solo I've ever heard.And it still kicks off from there being just as heavy as it did when it started.<br />The Thing That Should Not Be:This also has a very cool riff and is featured on their &quot;S&amp;M&quot; record which I think, IMO, is better than this one but this is a great song nonetheless.<br />Welcome Home(Sanitarium):Like One and Fade To Black, this is the heavy ballad on the record.This has a great chorus and has a great solo including the ones Kirk plays at the beginning and after the first chorus.<br />Disposable Heroes:Starting with a heavy riff, it's roughly 8 minutes of pure metal and also a great exercise in picking speed.<br />Leper Messiah:Along with Master Of Puppets, this is the funnest guitar song I've ever heard.Has an awesome sounding interlude.I'd start with this song if you wanna learn something from this album.It's really a surprise song that grew on me when I heard it.<br />Orion:If there's one thing this band excels at his from a music standpoint and to have an instrumental is just a great thing.Starting with a bass riff, the guitars come in which leads about 1:40 into one of the greatest ever.Simple in it's nature but comes off as a great sounding riff.Halfway through the song is the greatest bass interludes you'll ever hear.This song was played at Cliff's funeral and for good reason.To Live Is To Die is probably an ode to Cliff because it has a very melancholy feel especially starting around that 4:30 to 6:00 range.<br />Damage Inc:Starts with volume swells from Cliff(best bassist ever)leading to an extremely heavy song which after it ends, you've heard 8 songs of pure gold and why I consider them the best at Metal regardless of all the other heavier bands people will tell you about.
6304493681|3.0|The Good: Simply put, Ghost in the Shell, in its manga form, raises many questions about life, has amazing action sequences, and memorable characters.  Also, from a technical point, particularly for an &quot;early&quot; anime DVD, the video and audio quality is excellent, even compared to many new releases.<br />The Bad: The movie loses a good chunk of the political intrigue and philosophy that the books contain.  Thus, the characters feel flat, and the story is often rushed and disjointed, as though the only things kepts intact were the action sequences.<br />The Ugly: The English dub features some very poor voice acting in spots, and some fairly major changes in dialogue.  The Japanese dub &amp; subtitles however, are excellent. Note: I can generally live with English dubs, and watch them as often as the japanese dub with subtitles, so that should say something about this particular one.<br />Conclusion: An excellent DVD...but an average movie that could've been much better re-edited and/or longer.
0385505833|4.0|This is a well written story that basically makes fun of American Christmas traditions in a subtle way.  It doesn't directly make fun of them but makes you think about them and ask yourself if they are really all that important.  In the end though, the ultimate Christmas lesson is learned.  It is entertaining and a nice break from Grisham's usual story lines.  It is also easy to read, taking no time at all.  It is enjoyable the whole way through.  I didn't find myself at any time struggling to get through a &quot;boring&quot; part to get on with the plot.  It doesn't have to be Christmas time either to get the feel of what is going on.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it was just &quot;entertaining&quot;, not enthralling.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|First let me say that my actual rating for this movie is three and a half stars. Now judging by the reviews posted on this site for this movie you either love MOULIN ROUGE or you don't. I would not go so far so to say I hate it but of course I don't love it. I'll skip the opera like plot since probably mostly everyone knows it. The movie is filled with tons of kinetic energy, hypnotic sets, costumes, cinematography, editing, and choreography as well as leading and supporting actors which appeal to everyone. And don't forget all that music and dancing. Baz Luhrman has directed opera before and many remember his avant guarde interpretation of ROMEO AND JULIET so one would think he's perfect for this job and he is. The operatic performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor suit this movie very well. Now the reason why I did not think this was a perfect movie: when it doesn't have any singing or dancing (and even while there is singing and dancing) it reverts to unabashed kitsch. This becomes very tiring after a while. The majority of the kitsch comes during the second hour. It is made up of over-the-top sentiment which this viewer could not seem to get used to. There will be people who will embrace it for it's kitsch and those who will not. It all depends on you. But in terms of it's artistry (the singing, sets, etc.) one can't deny it's an accomplished film.

6305313687|4.0|I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone 16 and up...as a matter of fact, it is a \\"need-to-see\\" for ages 16 and up. The ending of the movie climaxes idiotic and pompous racial violence that exists in American cities today, and worldwide. This movie provides the viewer with a look into a highly racist situation in California, but the location doesn't matter. The themes of the movie play out for any and all racial violence that has ever occured. I take away one star due to the heavy language, heavy violence, and sexual/racist themes that only an higher-aged teen could relate with or understand.

B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby marks U2's impressive transition from the 80's most earnest rock band to the more exploratory, layered, and eclectic sound they have demonstrated since. It also marks the transition from primarily political topics to far more personal revelations, as in such masterworks as One and Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses. For me, it was such a departure from Joshua Tree that I vaguely recall not liking the album on first listen, though it quickly became my favorite.<br />The Zoo TV tour that followed this album struck me as anathema to the recording's unprecedented level of personal sincerity. The tour set up the band members as demi-gods to be worshipped, appealing at once to the masses who do, and to the more thoughtful fans who recognized the game as a sort of contempt for their hero status. It reminded me of John Lennon's more-popular-than-Jesus-Christ comments that were spoken in dismay, but got him into such trouble.<br />In all, this is the only album that I would compare to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper in that it marks (though in the opposite direction) the successful transition of a phenomenal band into an entirely new era and musical direction. This is perfect pop, easily digested, but uncommonly rich with (relatively) grown-up emotion and a brilliant, original tapestry of sound that pushes the limits of the traditional rock instrumentation.
0380788624|5.0|I didn't know too much about this book before diving in, outside of what I read on the back cover. The analogies to Pynchon were what sucked me into buying it, and there are certain similarities (funky character names, strange synergies, etc.) that Pynchon fans will see. It's a quick read, though, compared to Pynchon, and doesn't have the depth of Gravity's Rainbow (and that's not necessarily a criticism). The characters, for the most part, are very nicely developed (excluding, perhaps, a priest who ends up talking like a 15-year old American boy), the ending is very satisfying, and the multiple plot lines converge and overlap in constantly enjoyable ways. All in all, a great read.
B00005JKQX|4.0|After three days, I am still heavy with a certain fullness of the mind and heart that an intelligent movie sometimes leaves in its wake.  Russell Crowe was spell-binding as John Nash, demonstrating a Hoffman-esque range well beyond his pretty-boy contemporaries.  The world around him was well-stocked with convincing, albeit occasionally two-dimensional, offerings from a host of both rising and established actors.<br />The based-on-a-true-story plot was clearly carved into a more palatable form to suit this medium, as well it should be.  Although omitting significant areas and portions of John Nash's life, biography is often about deciding *which* story to tell, and the screenplay has a certain admirable economy of structure.  A tip of the hat to the trailer editors who didn't spoil the substance of the film.  Plot developments, unexpected twists, and mysteries that could fall either way propel the storyline, which is refreshing in this movie year of well-worn fairy tales.<br />After all is said and done, we have shared in both the beauty of genius and the anguish of mental illness.  This is a Hollywood film, sugary and self-censored, but smarter and more genuine than I've seen in recent memory.
B000002N3N|4.0|Her first three CDs: The Celts (aka Enya), Watermark, and Shepherd Moons are truly inspired. You simply don't want to miss a single song on any of them.<br />More recent are The Memory of Trees and A Day without Rain, which are also very good.<br />You could buy Paint the Sky with Stars, which contains music from her first four CDs. It is longer and therefore better than any one of them, but you would then realize that you have to go out and buy all four anyway.<br />Her music is often ethereal, but I think its real secret is that even her most joyous songs tend to have a dark element. For example, if you like music by U2, REM, Rush, Pink Floyd, Supertramp, etc., then you will like Enya.

B00005RYKV|1.0|Colors are not to be changed, they are to be left to their original tint or brightness. <br />Today I bought Brother at Best Buy. I was happy to find that I got the last copy of the 2 shelves of them. I was suprised, so I bought it. When I got to opening it, there was some nice cover art on the disc, and no freaking collecters booklet on most Sony discs. I popped the disc in to my new \\"Panny\\" RP56 and set down to watch on my Phillips 16:9 HDTV. Never have I seen a film murdered in front of my eyes. It's a movie about blah, blah go to Internet Movie Database and search under Brother to find out. <br />Aniki's(main character) world is not exciting, and somewhat gloomy. There is an occasional color flair(rare) to hint at a character's persoanlity. Blacks are deep and accurate, there are tons of gray, blue is on the dark side, green is in some scenes dark and other scenes light, finally red is crimson, and sometimes darker. All of this is representted accurately on the two DVD's I have previously watched(UK and Japan) and seen in a THX certified theater. The theater I saw the movie was dead on, and the picture quality was unbeatable. <br />All of the above is thrown out in the Sony Pictures Classics version. Gray is subdued and no longer prevalent. Blacks are ruined which killed a couple scenes. Blue is no longer dark or a little dark, it's plain blue. Green is a neon green in some scenes and now is a bright. Red is pushed, but just enough that the color is a bit lighter. <br />The beginning scene is ruined by the Sony version. Kitano standing waiting for the cab is supposed to stick out, and the background is covered in the back with a thing gray, to make him prevalent. Instead the Sony version completely takes out the gray, and the scene is then butchered. The scene where Kitano murders the Latino drug dealer the blacks are deep, the colors subdued. The Sony version, pushes the flesh tones the blacks are off, and the green door to the left of Claude Maki is now a bright neon green, whereas the other versions had the door dark green or a light pine green. <br />There also to seems to be a fairly large quantity of edge enhancement, which is absent on the 3 other sources. <br />What doesn't help the Sony Pictures Classics version is that its edited. The movie begins with a Sony Pictures Classics label pasted over the Kitano label, with the background music still there. This tells you that, you are about to watch an inferior version. There are various edits to the movie digitally. Such as painting over brain matter on walls from gunshots, and time and gore edits. The stark emotion of the Hagakure scene is also killed by the editing. <br />The features? Just some ...trailers for some movies that remind me of the word 'crud' The audio is okay, but with the lack of DTS,...
B00005KHJR|4.0|The extra scenes don't fit in terms of film quality, and harm the flow, but are fun to watch.  Watched it again after about 2 years, and the 2nd time was diminished, (I already knew the ending), and by the observation that it was more obvious than I had remembered it.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I liked a lot this movie, it is amazing what Tom Hanks had to put up with in order to get realism to his character. The airplane crash scene is spectacular.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I will not damn this movie with faint praise, the movie just plain sucks.  Although not the worst I've seen, I only suffered through it by fast forwarding (to see skin). It will be one of the ones I remember- to compare movies to.  Their attempt at humor isn't, and gets worse after 300 repetitions.  There are adult scenes, situations, violence, and drug use.  Bad &amp; boring.

B00005QW5X|5.0|With material that stretches the mind, but rocks you on the way, this movie encompasses everything that prove that filmed entertainment has surpassed novels as the most important artistic form.  The making of documentery is especially rewarding.  This disc is not for the young or faint of heart.  There are mature scenes- but little nudity, violence, and the language is relatively clean.  Most of the adultness of the scenes concerns sex / gender identity- which are explicitly dealt shown and dealt with, in the context of the movie.

B00005QDW1|1.0|I love No Doubt. I guess I might have seen this one coming, but I never could let the notion sink in. Tragic Kingdom was the first CD I've ever bought for myself. Collecting little bits of money wherever I could, I bought the disc after hearing Spider Webs and Just A Girl at summer camp, my first summer away from home. It took a very long time for them to follow up the success of their first big hit, but when they did, I was there within seconds, buying copies of Return Of Saturn, not only for myself, but for my friends as birthday gifts. It was a tough act to follow, but I was not disappointed. Bathwater, New, and a few other notable tracks made it worthwhile, despite the repetitive X-Girlfriend (but catchy) and some lackluster songs in between. Then, the ever-talented Gwen Stefani sang backup for Moby on South Side, my favorite song off his excellent album Play (favorite before being overplayed, but I still love it). Then, to my great surprise, and severe dismay, Let Me Blow Ya Mind was released with Gwen singing again. Was this an act of letting fans know No Doubt was on its way with more music and a means of satisfying them with something for the meantime? I seriously hoped not. The song was an R&B/rap/pop success that I was aching to eliminate from my memory, however, the face of Gwen on its media pervasion had me worried whether that would be possible. Well, now, finally, it's here. Rock Steady is out and I'm speechless. What kind of redundant, pop, non-instrumental, regression is this? The release of Hey Baby as the first single caught me offguard with its nonexistent lyrics,... charged implications, and dreadful tune. Now Gwen graces the covers of more magazines than ever, her video is on MTV non-stop, and she plays at billboard music awards next to Britney and Justin and Lil Bow Wow (not to mention her classy performance, wearing skimpy clothing and sandwiching herself between two sweaty male dancers, seemingly humping!). Where is the band in all this? I don't know and I don't understand, but I can only guess, reaping the benefits along with her from behind the scenes. There is no denying Rock Steady is No Doubt's most breakthrough commercial success. Congratulations!
0553712837|4.0|This is a Christmas story in the same vein as Dickens' Christmas Carol; in fact, the comparisons are quite striking.  We have a Scrooge/Krank who decides that there is little value to the traditional Christmas celebration replete with extra expense and frivolous celebration.  We have Marley's ghost/the daughter who &quot;visits&quot; the main character and reminds him of the reason for the season.  We have a rallying of good will from friends, neighbors, and strangers that brings the novel to its happy conclusion that sometimes the best holidays are ones that herald the unexpected and still retain familiar elements.  I liked the book.  It is leisure reading, but so was Dickens.
B00005QDW1|4.0|just so you know the ones that are writing a review of this album, and are stating that all the songs are 15 second loops, didnt actually purchase the album.  They are talking about the songs from the album that are in the popular file sharing networks.  The songs that are distributed are exactly that, 15 second loops.  The real album is not even close to what these people are talking about.  So in the future, before you write a review, either purchase the album, or make sur eyou download the correct version of the song.  Who in their right mind would release 15 second loops for an entire track????....
B000002BUY|5.0|S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is simply one of the best albums ever conceived/written/recorded. At the time when this was released, Incubus sounded like no other band. They were not \\"the next...\\" anything. They were the \\"first.\\" Now, of course, there are legions of imitators, not that that's a bad thing (imitation, afterall, is the highest form of flattery), but ya gotta stick with the true original. <BR>S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is quite a bit more raw and unrefined than their more recent releases, but that's part of what makes it so great. Not that what they're doing now is less good, but from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. you really get the best sense of the guys' true creativity and total genius. Often times, more involved levels of studio production tend to hide or strip away such qualities from any band. You get the distinct impression this record was crafted by a group of guys who just really love playing music...without any boundries, restrictions, or limitations... the way it should be. They're just doing their own thing and having a great time.<BR>...and if all that's still not enough for you, know this:<BR>It ...ROCKS! HARD!!

0066620996|5.0|Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics - This does not apply to this book despite the extensive use of statistical techniques to arrive at conclusions.<br />The second classic from Prof. Collins comes out with specific dimensions (like Level 5 leadership, Hedgehog Concept, First Who; Then What etc with a chapter devoted to each) on the transformation of good companies towards becoming great. One is sure to come across surprises in each, since findings from the data analysis of several hundred companies (from which the 11 great companies finally emerge), is much contrary to commonly held perceptions and beliefs. This makes it a great experience to read this book, page after page.<br />I have read &quot;Built to Last &quot; (Co-authored by Prof. Collins) twice; once when it was published and for the second time in Q2-2000 wondering what the &quot;New Economy&quot; was for the &quot;Old economy&quot; Visionary Companies that were &quot;Built to last &quot;. In my opinion &quot;most of the visionary companies would succeed in any kind of transformation in the marketplace...Dot Coms may kindly note.... &quot; (Read my review on Amazon.com- published May 9, 2000).<br />Given this insight, &quot;Good to Great&quot; is certainly a must read to see if anything has changed since then. I looked at the similarities and differences between these two research studies. In my opinion, it is hard to separate the two. By the time one finishes reading the good to great concepts, the similarity is striking. It would be wonderful to see companies that are great and ALSO built to last. Prof. Collins devotes a chapter exclusively to bring out the synergy between the &quot;Built to last&quot; and &quot;Good to Great &quot; concepts. The equation is:<br />Established Company or Start-up + Good to Great Concepts -&gt; Sustained Great Results + Built to Last Concepts -&gt; Enduring Great Company.<br />It is interesting to note that these concepts in the author's opinion can be applied for achieving greatness of any Organization, provided one is convinced that these principles can be applied. <br />The research methodology, selection criteria, rigor in data collection, data analysis and conclusions and the innumerable examples supporting each dimension is of the highest academic standards. The notes at the end of the book will prove useful for any student pursing research on similar topics.<br />The book opens with the words &quot; Good is the enemy of Great&quot;. Probably I need to change my vocabulary after reading this book!<br />Highly recommended.

0345451325|4.0|The Fall of Reach is a prequel telling the story of humanity's war against a technologically superior race called the Covenant, a mysterious race on a religious crusade to destroy humanity. The story focuses on the hero of the Halo Xbox game and his fellow Spartans, enhanced human beings bred as soldiers for humanity's military and the best chance the humans have for victory in the losing war against the Covenant. The events in the book directly lead into the events in the game.<br />Even without playing the game, it's a pretty good book by itself. The sci-fi universe created by Bungie (the makers of the game) which Nylund expands on is detailed and believable. Nylund's descriptions of space battles and futuristic militaries are excellent, as well as his portrayals of the human military strategy and tactics while fighting against a superior enemy. The book flows well and is an easy read.<br />But the book is raised to a new level if you play the game alongside reading the novel. Nylund's otherwise average character development and background instead become outstanding insight into the life of the game's hero and opens your eyes to the bigger picture of the Halo universe. You become truly immersed, which makes both the book reading and video game experience that much more rich.<br />Sci-fi nitpickers will criticize some of the technological aspects of the Halo universe (for example, it is 500 years in the future where humans have mastered faster-than-light travel and true artificial intelligence, yet soldiers and ships still use solid ammo as their primary weapons), but those issues are minor. Nylund is still able to suspend disbelief. And it doesn't hinder the overall good story.<br />Overall, good book by itself. But I recommend you play the game as well. If you enjoy the game, then this novel is a must read! I can't wait until the sequel for both!
B00005JKHP|5.0|Having listened to critics and fans bash this movie for so many years now, I was very happy to see it finally live up to its promise in this &quot;Director's Edition&quot;. Warning for non-Trekkers: the added information about the production- from director Wise to a seemingly nonplussed Shatner- is EXTENSIVE to say the least! For Trek enthusiasts it is a gold mine of behind-the-scenes footage, describing the minutae of costume design, storyboards, and yes, the development of the show's true star, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; itself. Newly created scenes flesh out some of the original sequences, from giant Vulcan statues to &quot;Vejur's&quot; exterior. Whether you are the kind of fan who dons pointed ears or the kind who doesn't admit it, this guilty pleasure runs long with lots of information...and is well worth the price. Thanks to Paramount for giving the ol' Enterprise some respect at last; she's made them quite a bit, and it's long due.
6305633177|5.0|In regards to the 1-star review obviously didn't bother to read anything about this DVD before purchasing it.  It clearly states in \\"EVERY\\" critical review that this is \\"NOT\\" a professional recording; it's a compilation of bootleg footage shot by Metallica fans during Cliff's 3 1/2 years with the band.  Bootleg footage, almost by definition, is guaranteed to be sub-par quality at best.  After everything I've heard about the crappy video quality, I have to say this DVD looks a helluva lot better than I was expecting, and it deserves nothing less that 5 stars!<br />But be warned: anyone expecting quality on par with Cunning Stunts or the S&M show should not buy this DVD.  Anyone who loved the Cliff Burton era of Metallica, or just wants to check out Metallica in the old days, pouring their heart, and soul into every show should pick this up in a heartbeat.<br />To quote Jaymz: \\"The quality in some places ain't that happening, but the feeling is there and that's what matters!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of the more entertaining films I have seen in a long time. Although a kids film, Shrek is a bit like Bugs Bunny cartoons in that it has been designed to be have a number of levels of humour which attract all age groups. <br />The reason why it is so good is the plot density. Each scene is carefully built up not only to keep up a narrative flow but to develop a multitude of jokes and parodies. At any point there will be a number of ongoing jokes which mean that your attention is continually engaged and you are never bored. <br />It is difficult to speculate but probably with a film using real actors the writers don't have to be as continually inventive. An audience can engage in either an adventure or a romance with real actors with reasonably limited dialogue. With an animation you probably need a lot of dialogue or action to distract an audience's attention away from the fact that the cast are animated figures. <br />Anyway this is a classic film. All of the actors who do the voice overs, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Carmen Diaz are brilliant. The plot is inovative altough it has some parrallels with Wagner's ring cycle.

In the book there are three children who lose both their parents in a fire that burned their mansion. So they live with a mean relative named Count Olaf.Cout Olaftreas them badly and yet wants something from them. The book  is written so young children can easily understand it.Had my father not sent me to bed I would have finished it in one sitting. The book brought alot of sad thoughts in my head and yet I found it quite interesting.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|For any person who knows a little about WWII history this movie is pure torture to watch.It is not so much that the whole plot is fantasy(the capture of the Enigma machine was done by the Royal Navy in very dangerous,but by far less spectacular, circumstances than the one depicted in the film)but that the whole atmosphere of the film is wrong.Pure common sense is affronted in many scenes as are historical facts(a few men man a submarine in an altogether impossible attack?a german destroyer and figther plane in the North Atlantic in 1942?Give me a break!) <BR>This film is a simple action movie in the way a 007 James Bond film is.If Hollywood wanted to make a film about the U.S submarine force in WWII it could have chosen many good stories from the Pacific theatre,like the one about the USS Wahoo.<BR>As it is this film is a travesty of a war movie.Want to see a good WWII submarine movie?Get Wolfgang Petersens DAS BOOT.
0380733358|5.0|This is perhaps the best book you will ever read.  It is fast-paced, and doesn't take forever to develop.  It is my personal favorite, and is recomended to everyone, particulary those who are interested in war-time England.
0345448898|5.0|These books are the best books I have ever read in my entire life. If you are a spiritual person, you'll especially love these books. It's not only for kids, although I do highly reccamend it for 12-16 year old boys and girls. It's a fantasy trilogy about a girl named Lyra Silvertongue and a boy named Will Parry. They each are on are there own inspiring quest full of adventure as they travel between many different worlds. Each book represents one of the awesomly powerful items that Will and Lyra get: The Golden Compass (Alethiometer), The Subtle Knife (Aesahaetr), and the Amber Spyglass (no name). VERY INTELLIGENTLY/CUNNINGLY WRITTEN. It has amazing detail, the best I've seen. I've read many books and these are probably the best I've ever read. Just make sure you read them in order, or else you will lose the complicated plot. I do not recomend His Dark Materials to young readers because of violence and completed reading.
B00000612P|5.0|Every Picture Tells A Story is a great album from the &quot;Victorian&quot;<BR>artistry of the cover to the folk-rock sound of the songs.<BR>from the hard-rock autobiographical title track, the story of a ill-fated romance in &quot;Maggie May&quot;, to the country twanged &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot;, to my favorite, the closing track, Tim Hardin's <BR>beautiful, &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;. This is a good album for those who think Rod only wrote &quot;poppy&quot; type music, it is worth a listen to. I recommend it highly.
B00005JKHP|5.0|This is the best of the Star Trek movies and it is a great adventure. The other Star Trek movies doesent have the quality like this one has. The special effects are really ground breaking and in most part better then Star Wars. Robert Wise is a great director and he really wanted to work on this film. The story is large and a celebration to the original series. If you compare this movie to the others in the Star Trek franchise, then this is a masterpice. Jerrys theme is legendary and the actors are great. This is Star Trek, this and nothing else.
0553277472|3.0|I've read about a third to a half of this book, and...<br />1. The author/narrator is very grandiose. Always looking for what's 'wrong' with this or that, and having no answers. The problem is that his 'what's wrongs' are pretty sophomoric. <br />2. Add to that that he is a very meticulous/rhetorical guy, and you get a lot of droning.<br />3. Throw in sappy storytelling of the kind... 'well this is where my pen landed, it has to be included'... and you may just find yourself annoyed fairly often.<br />What's good? So far his classic/romantic constructs are pretty interesting. But there's a lot of times he's flaking out in his way and it's not fun.
6305897786|5.0|Roman Pulanski's Ninth Gate is an enjoyable psychological occult thriller that follows in the footsteps of other great films like Rosemary's Baby and Angel Heart.  This is no blood and gore slasher flick.  The film follows the dark quest of rare book detective Dean Corso, played wonderfully here by a mousey and rumpled Johnny Depp in one of his most enjoyable roles.  Corso has been hired by wealthy publisher and self-styled demonologist Boris Balkan, played by a genuinely creepy Frank Langella, to authenticate his newly aquired copy of &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot;, a 17th century Satanic tome reputed to possess the ability to conjure the Devil himself.  The most enjoyable aspect of the story is how Corso's character changes over the course of his journey to the darkside.  He begins as a shady, self-centered mercenary, interested only in his share of the profit.  He himself seems to be a disgruntled bibliophile who now buys and sells rare volumes without care or affection for the people he works with or the books he swindles from unsuspecting collectors.  By the end of the film, however, Corso has himself become won over with the burning desire which consumes his employer Balkan in his drive to possess the very powers of Hell. A beautiful Lena Olin plays the equally obssessed former owner of the book who desperately wants to re-aquire it from Corso and will stop at nothing to do so.  What results is at times a slow but darkly entertaining tale of brooding mystery as Corso finally discovers the true power of the book and the secrets it contains.<br />There is a truly creepy feel throughout this film that compliments the subject matter quite well.  It does not rely on cheap quick scares or bloody axe murders which has become the bane of lesser films in recent history.  While I enjoy a good scare and plenty of good old fashioned gore, at times it is refreshing to find a movie that is intelligent enough to weave a good story and leave you wanting more.  The film leaves many questions to ponder as we follow Corso's quest to authenticate the Nine Gates.  What role does the Green-Eyed Girl, played by Emmanuelle Seigner, really play here?  Is she Corso's protector or the agent of his doom?  Is she the devil incarnate come to ensure the success of her satanic chosen one?  And what role do the Ceniza brothers, the old twin bookbinders from Spain, have to play in this?  Are they simply what they seem, helpful and knowledgeable about the book and it's unfortunate author Aristide Torchia?  Or are they also more than they appear...agents of the Devil perhaps?  This theme of being more than appearances runs throughout Ninth Gate, reflecting the fact that the Devil frequently works through seemingly innocent means and that appearances are often deceiving.  It reenforces in us the notion that evil and darkness surround us and are always watching, and that Satan is always looking for a few good men.more.

B00004TVV1|5.0|The styles of these two masters blend remarkably well on this collection of Ellington tunes performed with a combo of Ellington's rhythm section and Louis' Allstars.Duke's elegant playing and arrangements stand out and Armstong's blowing is as strong and direct as ever. Somehow it all adds up beautifully. Every track offers something unique. The masters seem to energize each as well as the other featured musicians. Anyone interested in Jazz who doesn't already own this should not hesitate.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes are just plain fun, and British Press Releases that claim them to be a great band are wrong.  The Strokes are way better than that, and their authenticity hydroplanes through dark alleys of sellouts, posers, and &quot;seemingly fresh music.&quot;  But the Strokes may be some of the only fresh alternative of 2001.  Despite Weezer's geek-rock triumph, Tool's clatter and clang rock-opus, and Pete Yorn's telling soliliquy festival, The Strokes hearty brand of New York rock is a reaper to its competition.  If the first single &quot;Last Nite&quot; doesn't have you in an all-out tap session, then stellar trip-hops like &quot;Barely Legal&quot; will.  The Strokes are unavoidable, irresistible, New York rockers with a sound sure to get the party started.
B000002HD5|5.0|When I purchased this album back in 1993, I wasn't sure what I'd be getting. Over 8 years later, I'm still not 100% sure what I got. That is the depth of meaning and passion that Greg Dulli and the Afghan Whigs put into this album. It is by far their strongest, most powerful effort.<br />The lyrics are...passionately disturbed. The songs reek of dysfunctional relationships, marred by substance abuse and physical violence. \\"What Jail Is Like\\" is a powerful description of being trapped between guilt and visceral pleasure. \\"Debonair,\\" their minor MTV and radio hit off of this album, describes the dysfunctional roles that we take on in our relationships and the power that we can wield over one another. My personal favorite off of this album is \\"Fountain and Fairfax.\\" \\"Fountain\\" is a painfully powerful song about lies and heroin addiction, about codependence and desire. It's lyrics are haunting and true.<br />The Afghan whigs struck gold with this album. It's a disturbed, mysterious piece from front to end. I highly recommend it.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Bob Dylan's voice is no popular catch, in fact his music sits shakily in with the rest of the crowd, but Love and Theft is proof that Dylan can still write songs that matter.  His 43rd album could be his best work since Blood on The Tracks and the production style is the perfect accomplice.  &quot;Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum&quot; is just one example of Dylan's signature goofball classics.  For those of you looking for easily digestible rock albums, Love and Theft is the polar opposite of what you should be listening to.  But for those of you who have room for some Dylan, he's back, he's strong, and he may have the best album of 2001.
0062502182|3.0|If you'd like something light to read to provoke a little thought about paths not taken and goals not pursued, why not try The Alchemist as an easy first step toward evaluating your own life?<br />Santiago is a shepherd living a fairly ordered existence, yet intrigued by a recurring dream of a child playing with his sheep, who then transports him to the Pyramids, and shows him a spot where a great treasure is hidden. He seeks out a dream-interpreter, who agrees to tell him the meaning of the dream for one-tenth of the treasure. Santiago then sets out on a journey toward the treasure.<br />The journey is long, and involves many hard decisions between action and safety, and whether to trust his instincts or to do the \\"responsible\\" thing. He makes mistakes, gets sidetracked a little, and finds more than he bargained for on his journey, which makes a great fable about persistence and seeing priorities.<br />Okay, it's a fable - you have to be pretty forgiving to glean any hard tips about pursuing dreams from a story about a shepherd. Anthony Robbins it's not, but it's pretty well written, and uplifting - I don't know that a book that you can finish in one afternoon can be held to that strict a standard. This book can be a kind of relief if you have some soul -searching to do about what you're doing with your life. In a time and economy where every iota of common sense dictates no unnecessary risks, this simple fable can help to reframe much of the fear and uncertainty we all have as we see some of our dreams retract from us due to neglect or every day life.<br />This type of book won't offer the same type of guidance as the bullet-pointed self helpers littering the Bestseller rack, yet reading books like The Alchemist can give you the inspiration and the emotional energy to keep on keepin on - which is nothing to sneeze at. If you read Illusions, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, or even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, you'll find something in The Alchemist.
B000002JR8|4.0|Heavy metal can quickly turn into a genre that throws senseless punches at society's glum faults, but not Pantera.  Far Beyond driven is a sister to earlier classics like \\"Reign in Blood\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", and \\"Black Sabbath.\\"  Phil Anselmo's [gutsy] metal bark puts the finish on a band ready to win the no mercy challenge.  Vinnie Pauls strong double bass kick replies to Darrel's rip n' roar guitar snatches, and Rex's sinister bass lines call to mind Jack from Cream.  Songs like \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" are a sure-fire bomb-shell calling for success.  The album ends apropriately with a cover of Sabbath's failure \\"Planet Carvan\\" and turns it into an unyielding work of musical subsistence.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Holy...this is a great movie. The speed, and the action is so awesome, you won't even have time to blink! You'll love this movie especially if your a guy (though i disagree with the people who say it's ONLY for guys, cuz it's not.) get this now!
B00005QDW1|1.0|Well I bought this album without hearing a note based upon their <BR>last album Return of the Saturn which was an excellent album. What comes immediately to mind is what were these guys doing putting out an album this bad? I mean c'mon it sounds like bad 80's retro music meets Hip-Hop. They even bring in Ric Ocasek to produce 2 songs that sound like bad outtakes from Heartbeat City.<BR>This album is bad bad bad.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I think that John Mayer is an amazing guitarist/singer/songwriter.  Every song on this album seems to be written with such heart and emotion...as a matter of fact most people are instantly taken in by Johns music.

My fave song of his is (as usual) Your body is a wonderland!<BR>J
0525946284|5.0|I go back to The Key to Rebecca and The Eye of the Needle with this author. He is at the same level with this story of WW 2. Some may see the story as trying to curry favor with the feminists among us who believe they could be running everything if only we could reverse some historical pronouns. Actually, the ladies that attempted to sabotage the Nazi phone system in France, just before D Day had help from within their numbers by a male from within and without their numbers. This is really a well told story of the life of the times by an author who does his research and presents as compelling a story as he has ever written I could recount the outline of the story, but others here have done it well. My report is that Ken Follett is at the top of his game with this offering and that is well worth the purchase of this book. You will savor it!
B000002JSN|5.0|This album has so many of the greatest Zeppelin songs, that it would be ridiculous not to add it to your collection.  \\"Custard Pie,\\" \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"In The Light,\\" \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" \\"The Wanton Song,\\" and \\"Sick Again,\\" could all conceivably fall into a person's list of top 10 Zeppelin tracks.  Not surprisingly, these are the only new songs written for Physical Graffiti.  The rest were leftovers from the previous studio efforts.<br />These leftovers do add a nice flavor, though.  The Hawaiian-style guitar on \\"Down By The Seaside\\" and the very melodic \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" give us a glimpse of the softer side of the band.  In contrast, \\"The Rover\\" shows us Led Zeppelin at its very harshest.  \\"Night Flight\\" is probably the strongest of the leftovers and is one of the most emotionally arousing Led Zeppelin songs.  The only weak spot is \\"Houses of the Holy\\" with its annoyingly immature lyrics and average guitar work.<br />This album is essential for anyone who likes Led Zeppelin or classic rock.  But get this album after II and IV.  Although Physical Graffiti is better in many respects, it's more for listeners who are already fans of the band.
0679720200|5.0|The main character in the novel (hero or anti-hero) is someone that its not attached emotionally to the world or anyone in it. He is more concerned with himself and his physical sensations. At the beginning it may sound just like a selfish person, but when we start to understand his nature things get so clear that we start to wonder about the way we lead our lives.<BR>The hero(?) doesn't believe in God, the end is the end, so why live this life, which is the one we are sure we have, thinking or acting in behalf of some after life that might as well not exist? Why be attached to people when they all will die? Why not live fully and try to get the best for us and us only? Why worry about details when the final plan (death) is already laid out? These are all questions that we seem to ask, and in the end the character in neither strange nor selfish, but in a way a reasonable human being with a naked view of life - what turns out to be mind boggling.<BR>He is a stranger in the sense that he doesn't quite follow society's \\"games\\" or predetermined line of conduct, he is truthful with above all - himself, and does not bother in justifying his actions or telling lies. And off course he has a huge lack of interest as if he were only a spectator of his own life (in a sense aren't we?) so his decisions really didn't matter. In the end he is judged by not (re)acting as he is supposed to, and things that are at first looked rather without importance are turned into a question of life or death...
0525946284|1.0|A predictable thriller the purpose of which seems to be to sell the movie rights. You can just SEE the special effects. Oh yes, plenty of gratuitous sex at regular intervals to broaden the appeal and assure an R rating.  I'm not a frequent reader of this genre, but the plot borrows wholesale (with no apparent attempt to repay the debt) from &quot;The 7 Samurai&quot;. Can't hold a candle to &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;.
B000002NIW|4.0|This is getting out of hand. I'm not sure what's worse; our nation settling for less when it comes to music or heavy metal cynics telling people that they ... [aren't any good] and need to grow some tastes. I've tried listening, I've tried being nice, and I've tried avoiding stepping on people's toes. You know what, ... BEING NICE! I enjoy this thoroughly and there's nothing you can do about to make me change my mind!<br />Immaturity aside, I think there is a lot positive to say about Around The Fur. Yes, its a little basic. Yes, its a bit repetitive. Does it make it any less compelling to listen to? Not at all. Since most of the songs are of the straight forward bombast variety(or lack there of), its easy to get pulled into this CD and not lose interest. Chino's voice demands attention because just the moment he lulls you into a silent moment, a violent hook tears you back in. Abe may not be the greatest technical drummer around(that title belongs Danny Carrey, Josh Freese and Tim Alexander) but he does have some great moments hand certainly is competent(I play drums so I'd like to think that I have some knowledge of these sort of things) and if anything else, signature. Steven plays guitar heavy and it stays that way for the rest of the album. Not alot of hooks or variety but certainly keeps things moving(you have to admit, the Be Quiet And Drive riff is pretty memorable). Though Chi is less than audible, he is still a decent bass player.<br />My only complaint is that it's a tad on the repetitive side, but since it can hold my interest to the very end, I'm can't say that's all bad. Certainly could do a lot worse. I say buy it if your in the mood for a nice, heavy, thick wall of noise with some anger thrown in for good measure. Sure its not quite as heavy as most death metal but at least it's a more compelling listen.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have only held a mild interest in the band Radiohead. Critics have been raving about them for some time but when I listened...I thought them as partly interesting but nothing great. I bought Kid A because many proclaimed it to be the best of the year. I listened to it a few times and came to the conclusion it was a cheap rendition of something along the lines of Fripp/Eno and was placed on the shelf with the many other cd's I own. I recently saw Vanilla Sky and recognized the song from the Radiohead vocals which are very distinct in sound. I decided to pull back out the cd and attempt to listen to it with a new attitude. Wow!!! What a great cd. From beginning to end, the vocals and techno(for lack of a better term) sounds put you into a trance which makes you feel like you are on some sleepy mind trip. The cd is now in my regular rotation and I must admit it is truly a great compilation of songs, probably one of the best ever which is more than I can say for the movie. If you own a copy of the cd, give it another try and listen to it again. If you buy it, listen to it many times before forming an opinion. It is truly a cd unlike anything you have heard before.
B0000009RX|5.0|How can a record be bad when it implores you to &quot;Take our Clothes Off When You Dance&quot; ?  At the ripe young age of 12, this collection seemingly peeled back the protective skin on my forehead and injected my brain with the fresh breath of reality.  It didn't just offend the hippies that thought they were the greatest thing since sliced bread - it attacked nearly every segment of 60's culture and asked us &quot;Are You Hung Up&quot;?<br />I think Frank Zappa was a very misunderstood artist, which relegated him to the status of a cult legend.  But people are still listening and some are learning that he was one of the great musical geniouses of the last century.  This disc might not be the most accessible place to start, but if you are looking to expand back into the early part of the catalog, you must find a place for this disc in your collection, if only to find different ways to look at yourself.  As Frank said:<br />&quot;What's the ugliest part of your body?<br />Some say your nose, some say your toes<br />But I think it's your mind.&quot;

B00000634J|5.0|I love John Lennon.  I still miss him and mourn his death.  What he was as a person seems even more meaningful now than when he wrote and sang these songs.  But to me, his solo albums often lacked cohesiveness and suffered from inconsistency of quality.  Still, he managed to write a couple or more gems per record and when you asemble them together, as in this set, we are reminded of his incredible genious.  The more I listen to his work, the more I realize just how right he was in perspective.<br />&quot;Imagine&quot; was overplayed to death back in the day, but it is still one of the most powerful pop tunes in history.  Likewise, &quot;Mother&quot; is so personal and intense that it still causes me to tense and look inward.  When I hear &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;, I once again wonder if the right people are making the important decisions in the world today.<br />Timeless music by a man with a golden heart.

B00005R87Q|1.0|I knew when I rented this movie that it wasn't going to be an intellectual tour de force, or an excercise in brilliant writing or Oscar nomination material. <br />I did however expect some exciting and well done chase scenes. Instead what I got were a bunch of cluttered, ill defined shots of what used to be good cars chasing each other needlessly, recklessly and carelessly by a bunch of no good kids who need a dope slap, a real dose of reality and some honest work.<br />This movie showcases what is wrong w/society and values today. To make matters worse, it glamorizes and endorses dangerous driving, terrible music and anti social behavior.<br />I could forgive any of this had the movie been filmed well and realistically. The editing was terrible, there was no continuity within what was supposed to be the same chase. <br />Also, I'd be fascinated to know how each of these cars managed to get a seemingly unlimited amount of nitrous. Don't they come in small bottles and last for about 30 seconds each? Wish my car had the fuel capacity these third world slot cars do.<br />Save yourself some money, some time and rent a movie that has interesting people, interesting cars and superb chase scenes. Bullit, The French Connection, and What's Up Doc are three that come immediately to mind. With those movies you get a bonus; decent acting, professional photography, and a good screenplay.<br />The Fast and the Furious needs to come in for a major tune up, tear down and a frame up restoration. It's too bad that the screenplay wasn't stolen with the contents of one of the trucks.<br />Save your money and play a similar arcade game. You'll have more fun, and get a bigger rush.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is so much more than a music CD, it also covers so many aspects of Britney, her feelings, faith, as well as her past and future. I don't like the hip-hop edge that has crept in because I am not a fan a that sort of music. This didn't spoil the CD for me because of tracks like Overprotected and Bombastic Love, which are more like hr old style.<br />I think that this Cd proves that Britney does not fall into the manufactures and 'fake' catorgery. I think this because if she was simply a puppet she would have produced music that is a replica of ...baby, because she know's that it sells. She is taking a real gamble with this CD because she may lose fans who only like poppy music.<br />I really respect her for this because it means she is doing what she's always wanted to do, Write and perform refletive music that means something to her, that people enjoy listening to, and that is successful in the charts.
B00002Z88D|2.0|Metallica has some pretty cool songs, but most of them aren't on S&amp;M. I prefer listening to Unforgiven II and the song from Mission Impossible, those are my favorite Metallica songs. If I had to recommend one Metallica album it would be Ride The Lightning.
6304712936|5.0|This is one I can never get sick of! The music sounds magical (especially on DVD) as one would expect. Yet the best thing to me about this is F. Murray Abrahams performance as Saliri...just plain brilliant! This movie weaves history, comedy, drama into an unforgettable masterpiece! Check it out!
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease is one of my favorite movies and the soundtrack is one of my favorites I never get tired of either and I very highly recommend both the movie and the soundtrack!
B00005R87Q|5.0|Paul Walker as an undercover cop, and a street racer was a very exciting role. He did a great job by being the snowman, or the guy who at first was not respected. The movie ending to most people would be incomplete, but was truly amazingly thought up. This movie, other than the fact it may influence young watchers to try these wicked stunts, was an amazing creation. With no doubt, I would definately give it five stars.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is definately the most varied album yet from Radiohead, which is saying a lot. With a little tinkering, all the songs could have gone on at least one of their previous recordings. It's not a large step forward, it's more of an album to let us catch our breath from the artistic leaps and bounds they have made with each previous album. As usual the songs feature amazing musicianship, vocals, lyrics, production, track order... the list goes on and on. This marks the 4th straight album to have such incredible depth- you are not going to find any filler here, and neither will you find a top 40 single. Stick to this album, it can not be fully appreciated with only a token listen. After this album, I have no idea where Radiohead will go with their sound, which is very exciting and not something you can say about any other rock band today.<br />Best moments: &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; is an instant classic radiohead ballad to go with Creep, Fake Plastic Trees, High and Dry, etc. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is a beautiful experiment with vocals only Thom Yorke can attempt safely. &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; has The Best Colin Greenwood bass line, ever. <br />Drawbacks: &quot;Knives Out&quot; gets old real quick. No, it could not have been on The Bends. &quot;Life In a Glasshouse&quot; grows on you, but personally I can't stand horns in my songs. It's a personal preference, I know people who think this is the album's high point.
B00005K3NR|4.0|&quot;Carrie&quot; gets the royal treatment here: great print, lots of extras.  Especially recommended to those who have seen only the edited network-TV version of this classic.  Wait'll you see the punch this original cut packs in terms of adult content and scares.  Say what you want about De Palma, but the man is daring and refuses to bore his audience.
B000002TPS|5.0|This is my personal favorite Megadeth album.By all means buy it.
0385505833|4.0|Join Luther and Nora on their hysterical journey as they decide to give up the commercial trappings of Christmas, save their money, and go for a Carribean cruise. I laughed, I sympathized, I was angry, I was sad, and finally I cried tears of joy for the Kranks and their neighbors. This is a wonderful departure from the usual courtroom drama for John Grisham. I hope he'll write more books like this one.
B00005JKT8|5.0|For anyone that enjoys trashy romance novels, this is a movie for you.  I have read 100s of romances and it was great to actually see a movie that had a male character like the ones from the books.  Of course, Hugh Jackman's Leopold makes modern men look completely lacking.  But then, so do the romance novels.  =)  Definitely a chick flick.  I can't imagine any guys liking this movie, so gather some girlfriends to watch this one.  Hugh Jackman made this movie great.  Meg Ryan almost became like a supporting actor rather than the main character.  A great movie to watch and fantasize about the perfect man.  Is there really anyone like Leopold out there??
B000056K04|3.0|I so loved &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; that I was really looking forward to &quot;Everyday.&quot; Having heard it, I'd almost say I'm disappointed.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is pleasant enough, but definitely lacks the magic and the pull of the earlier disks. I was expecting something great.<br />I'll be interested to see what DMB does next.  Hopefully this is just a brief lapse.
B00004Z459|5.0|I heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the radio after i bought this CD.  I actually had never played it, but now I play it so much that the bottom is scratched all over!  It still plays.  Well anyway, the album is very very good for nu-metal fans.  The songs are rated below:<BR>     <BR>     #1: Papercut:  Intense start, emotional finish, rapped throughout.  A great song, powerful intro.  (9/10)<br />     #2: One Step Closer:  The hardest song on the CD.  Free of rapping.  Very intense; the second best on the CD.  (10/10)<br />     #3: With You:  Very rythmatic, with a lot of beats and scratching in the background.  Nice song.  (8/10)<br />     #4: Points of Authority:  No raps except the beginning and the 2:15 mark.  Great work. (9/10)<br />     #5: Crawling:  Awesome work, I think its about some mental patient.  3rd best. (10/10)<br />     #6: Runaway:  Not very good for their standard, but still a good song; all about betrayal.  Nice.  (7/10)<br />     #7: By Myself:  A sleepy rap, nice job, with what seems like a crash in the background  (9/10)<br />     #8: In the End:  DEFINITELY THE BEST!!!  One of the best nu-metal songs ever.  Rapped and rocked in various spots.  (10/10)<br />     #9: A Place For My Head:  Mostly rapped, very rapid fire style,  about being used by people.  (8/10)<br />     #10: Forgotten:  A hard rap about tough times.  (9/10)<br />     #11: Cure for the Itch:  Record sampling all about rythyms and beats.  No singing, just the DJ at work.  (8/10)<br />     #12: Pushing Me Away: Lighter rock, only a little rapping.<BR>This is the 4th best.  (10/10)<br />    This was an awesome CD that you just don't want to stop playing.  If you even remotely like to listen to rock or nu-metal, this is the Cd that will get you listening all the time.  It is a great album and worth every last penny you pay for it!
B00005RYKV|5.0|For example, the young lady who played Marina was wonderful in her role, and brightened up this darkly humorous Gangster Noir film.<br />Watch this clever film.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; on Q101.  It was one of the best songs I had heard in a while, and is the best song on the CD.  These guys earned their success by playng loud, heavy rock and playing that formula though all the songs.<BR>The tracks did all soung familiar, though, so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  When completely summed up, it is loud stuff that metal and hard rock fans will really like.  It is definitely not nu-metal, and it is free of raps, which is a very nice change in rock these days.
0385505833|4.0|I read this book in about two hours and laughed at loud several times throughout the book.  The only problem I had with the book was how the neighbors treated them which I feel was a bit outrageous; however, the ending of the book makes the rest of the story digestible.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I preordered this DVD long before it is released. I like it so much. The first episode is classic and the 2nd episode is even <BR>better. Robert De niro is quite charismatic as the growing mafia<BR>boss and the different scences intervened together quite well. <BR>The third one is not as good as the first two. However, it is still pretty awesome to watch. The extra disk is not worth that much. I think that only crams more stuff in one dvd box so that the customers may feel they have got more than they should have with that price.

B00004WGC4|5.0|There are not many videos to which I would give a blanket recommendation regardless of one's tastes, but this is one of them.  No matter what type of humour you like, you will thoroughly enjoy this series.  Indeed, for the person who has yet to experience the sheer enjoyment and utter satisfaction that only well-crafted British comedies can provide, this is the place to start.  It was, in fact, the series that provided my introduction to British comedy just over 10 years ago.  My only regret was not discovering this series (and this genre) sooner!<br />The boxed set contains all twelve 30-minute episodes.  As a point of interest, it took John Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth six weeks on average to write a single episode--a fact which should come as no suprise given the quality of the episodes, for there is not one that is anything less than a masterpiece.  Indeed, with skilfully interwoven subplots that progress with mounting speed towards an uproarious climax, this is without a doubt the most masterfully written (and certainly one of the most consumately acted) comedy series the world has ever seen.<br />John Cleese stars as the highly-strung, incompetent, socially-inept (not forgetting hen-pecked) innkeeper, Basil Fawlty, relegated to a life of penance in the form of marriage to the capable but overbearing, domineering, and brassy Sybil (Prunella Scales).  Throughout the series, the Fawltys are assisted (or hampered!) in running the hotel by their employees.  Firstly, there is the calm, intelligent, and extremely competent Polly (Connie Booth), a combination waitress, chambermaid, desk clerk, and general saviour without whom the hotel would surely collapse into evern greater chaos.  Then there is Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a Spanish immigrant whose unfamiliarity with the English language and customs results in some of the most hilarious interchanges of dialogue.<br />In addition to witty and comical dialogue, the series is loaded with the most side-splitting slapstick I've ever seen.  Manuel, for all his blunders, is usually the &quot;butt&quot; of numerous very realistic-looking kicks, whacks, and general manhandling by Basil.<br />In conclusion, there are plenty of other well-written, hilarious British comedies around, but Fawlty Towers stands at the pinnacle.  It is the yardstick against which all the others are inevitably measured.  It is, in short, representative of the very best comedy (British or otherwise) ever to be seen.  Extremely highly recommended!<br />(By the way, for those interested, October 2001 saw the UK release of a very good, beautiful quality tribute book entitled Fawlty Towers Fully Booked by Morris Bright and Robert Ross.)
B000001FS3|5.0|In 1987, a Rolling Stone reviewer called this album, &quot;unforgettable&quot; and certainly if it is not just that, it comes damn close. U2's &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; is a modern rock classic.  <br />That said, it is a bit difficult to put a finger on what makes this album so spectacular because it is not groundbreaking, it didn't introduce a new sound to the masses, and it was done by a band that was already getting some notice for its previous works, War, October, and Boy, respectively.  Likewise, from such a definition, there seems nothing atypical or notable about this recording that would make it stand out from the rest.  <br />The reason this album is spectacular is because it is so cohesive, honest, and beautiful. The album yielded four singles that blew up on album-oriented rock radio (&quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;, &quot;With or Without You&quot;, and &quot;In God's Country&quot;) but in truth, this was not a singles album at all.  U2 got it right on this one, and wrote eleven spectacular songs that flow easily from one track to another, and are all pristine and notable in their own right.  Specifically, &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; features a soaring 55 second guitar solo courtesy of the Edge, &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; features some plaintive Bono crooning, and final track, &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; is simple, subtle, and beautiful.   <br />Spiritual, uplifting, dark, introspective, and honest all at once, U2's &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; is in many ways the group's swan song, the album that brought their music and  politics to the masses to stay for good.  It is an unquestionably a modern rock classic, and an album that belongs in everyone's music collection.
6305910103|2.0|ST2 is an enjoyable adventure marred by a miniscule budget.<BR>The budget was so small that they re-used effects from the first film,used a television film crew,re-used the bridge set 3 different times for different ships and didn't have the money to finish the Eden Cave effect which was over-exposed.<BR>The ship's power source(which Spock repairs)looks like a giant salt shaker on a disco dance floor,hardly the large power source that it should have been,due to the tiny budget of 3 and a half million dollars(the real budget reported at the time).<BR>On the plus side,the battle scenes are eccellent,although the nebula looked a little fake at times,and the Kirk/Spock/McCoy interactions are fun the watch.<BR>After the slow STTMP,it was good to see the relationships and humour re-ignited on ST2.<BR>Nicholas Meyer's direction is good and the music by James Horner is a highlight.<BR>So,if you like an entertaining B-grade film then ST2 will entertain you.
0385505833|4.0|For anyone who has ever thought about giving up all the &quot;nonsense&quot; that makes up the Christmas experience, this is a must read.  Although it is a bit exaggerated and the family is wealthier than most readers, the book captures the &quot;If it can go wrong, it will&quot; reality in many of our lives.  Readers may recognize one of their own family members or a neighbor in one of the characters, making this a fun read.  With just a few hours of time, the reader can imagine, just once, what could be, and then be glad for what is.  Read this book during the Thanksgiving or Christmas holiday period and be ready to smile.
1558216847|5.0|I've re-read this story several times, and I still can't put it down each time.  I'll agree that some of the areas are very difficult - if not impossible - to believe (especially surviving the desert trek), but I've wanted to give Mr. Rawicz the benefit of the doubt.  His story seems sincere enough, and I figured that there had to be some significant details left out (probably by the editors), so I started doing some digging.<br />I learned that Mr. Rawicz is still living in England, and answers his mail.  I've met - through the internet - a good group of others who are interested in finding out more about this story, particularly to confirm the validity of these events.  Some have already been in touch with Mr. Rawicz, and have filled me in on some of the missing details - such as collecting rainwater in their jackets during the few rainstorms they received in the desert.  There is talk of turning this into a movie, and if this story can be confirmed to be true or at least possible, I believe it should be made into a motion picture.<br />To help in this effort and to search for verifying information, we've started building a website to share what information we have so far, and to ask for help from those who could contribute to the research in any way (even if it's a disputing point - for which we've also set up a newsgroup linked through the website).
B00003CXXR|2.0|Let me tell you this first, I loved the first two Jurassic Parks.<br />Then came Jurassic Park III.<br />The basic point of the movie was so somehow they could make up a storyline believable enough that people would come and see it and the producers could make some money.<br />This movie passes by too fast, your sitting down and putting the first popcorn in your mouth and WHAM! it's over.<br />Bottom line -<br />Unless your into a few fake dinosaurs, one old Jurassic park character (Goldblum wasn't in this one :(), and a short film...<br />BUY IT<br />otherwise<br />Go and see something good, like Lord of the Rings or the old documentary Hoop Dreams
B00004Z4WR|3.0|The movie is excellent, Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie play awesome parts in the movie. I just can't stop raving over the special effects. The story is brilliant. But it is recorded in a 16-9 TV format (widescreen tv's). Now if you have a Panasonic or Sony DVD Player you could have some problems with this DVD. I'm not bangin the movie it's just the DVD could have been recorded better. Later.
6304936303|4.0|Back in 1991 there was still only one way that studios could sell Bruce Willis and that was as various incarnations of his Die Hard hero. Even Eddie (Hudson) Hawkins had similarities to John McClane. Joe Hallenbeck is a sort of mix between McClane and a stereotypical hardboiled private eye. Watching him mumble and grunt through various near-deaths and close shaves makes for much fun.<br /><br />As a private dick Hallenbeck scrounges for work wherever he can find it. So he takes up a job protecting a stripper named Cory and soon finds himself in a lot of trouble with the men who are controlling Pro Football. Bad guys are trying to get him left and right, and his bratty 13-year-old daughter tagging along doesn't help much.<br /><br />Tony Scott's style of direction is best suited to this type of action flick. The flashy, exotic editing and cinematography techniques lend a lot to the witty script and compliment the seedy back alleyways and pretty Los Angeles vistas. Shane Black has also written dozens of one-liners and riddled the script with funny dialogue and exciting situations. It's no surprise that this was once the most expensive script ever sold in Hollywood.<br /><br />Some people say that this film is too violent and misogynist but I honestly cannot understand what they are talking about. I guess it was just a little out of the norm back in 1991. But still the tone of the film is so light and enjoyable you begin to wonder how this never made up for it. Check it out for yourself and I am sure that you will enjoy.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and is remastered in Dolby 5.1. Love that opening song, man
B000002GF8|4.0|The one thing I miss is the reggae feel they had on their first albums. But this is a fine piece of work and the last decent piece of work Sting did, or probably ever will do. He's recorded the equivalent of Muzak on his solo albums. So do yourself a favor and listen to SYNCHRONICITY instead.
068485015X|3.0|Dr. Peck is an acute observer of human nature, and backs up his case with powerful case studies.  His points about love being an act of willed generosity and attention to another still resonate twenty years plus after the book's publication.<br />That said, it could use some updating to incorporate some social changes off the last twenty years.  There's a particularly discordant note struck about midway through, when, unless I'm misunderstanding something, Peck suggests that the moment &quot;the passive homosexual gathers the courage to ask a girl on a date&quot; represents some kind of courage.  This is at odds with the book's message of self-acceptance, honesty and getting together the guts to live your life.
B00004XONN|5.0|If this album had been released 30 years ago, such a statement could not have been made and been true because modern music was in its heyday. In today's Britney and 'Nsync obsessed world however it's incredibly true. The consumer public has come to the point where we expect catchy hooks and catchphrases with our music but we never expect the actual music to be of any merit. Radiohead makes a bold slash at that statement. Kid A is an album with 10 music-based gems. The mood is different for each track and each track evokes a different image. This CD is not one that is easily grasped in one listening. Listen more than once and perhaps you'll hear the melancholy in &quot;Kid A,&quot; feel like your in a big cavern like I did with &quot;Treefingers,&quot; or perhaps you'll love the sweeping music of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot; It's easy to say that Radiohead is trying to be overly pretentious and artsy-fartsy with this album, but why shouldn't they try and be artsy? Without new innovators we'll be stuck with Britney for another 10 years while we wait for another &quot;Kid A&quot; to come out. Buy this album and listen to it a couple of times. There is beauty hidden under those bleeps and blips. It's well worth your time to find that beauty.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Back in the mists of the late 1970's I found a scratchy vinyl discard of Songs of Love and Hate at a library sale, and then spent many a long night in a cheap apartment with a bottle of scotch and the record player, imbibing the songs along with the liquor.  So many songs since then have been poured down the gullet to the soul and now Here It Is, 2002.  These new songs are a rare and rich VSO.  Drink up!
B00005OM4N|4.0|I'm shocked that folks would be giving this CD a bad review... I'm not a hard-core Britney fan and didn't really care to purchase this album, although at the top spot of the charts.... However, I immediately ran to the store - the video, the song... the sex!  I couldn't resist any longer.  I'm sorry, but this girl has it going on!  no, she doesn't have the strongest voice, yes, the music could get a little more original... however, she has exactly what Madonna has going for her: she's a STAR.  We could debate how cruel the world is that someone like Christina Agueliera will be gone in five years, although she has a magnificent singing voice &lt;as is the case with Deborah Gibson and Tiffany&gt;, and that Britney will still be here in 20 years... but what's the point?  I'm settling in for the long haul with this girl. and with no complaints!  keep those hits coming Britney!!!  She's a Superstar, there's just something about her.  But one thing, please oh please oh please do a cover of &quot;Crazy For You&quot;.  That would be the ultimate.   in the meantime, can you, can you, can you handle it?
B000002J09|5.0|Not much more can be said about this CD, which i rank as the best album of all time. There is not a bad song on it, and virtually all the songs get daily airing on classic rock radio. Not to mention that includes the best song of all time, &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; People may say that song and this album are overrated. True, but there is a reason for it: it's that good. From the acoustic &quot;Stairway,&quot; &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; and &quot;Going to California&quot; to the raw power of &quot;Black Dog,&quot; &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;When the Levee Breaks,&quot; this is the most enjoyable CD I own. Buy it today!!!!!

0345440757|2.0|The realization of motherhood was pretty scary to me.  I hardly had any experience with infants and desperately needed some guidance!  When I heard of this book, I immediately rushed out to purchase it with the hopes of learning the many aspects of infants' needs and how to basically establish a daily flow to our new lives together.  Although some of the basic concepts are helpful, this book did not offer me the overall 'guide' I was in search of in order to establish a daily flow, including feeding and sleeping routines.  Instead, I found that the book 'On Becoming Baby Wise' was the exact resource I needed!  It is wonderful and has been a lifesaver to me!!  Although it is less expensive than 'Secrets of the Baby Whisperer', it is worth far much more!
B00005JKQX|4.0|If you like Ron Howard's brand of feel-good films, and I typically don't, then this movie is for you. I am a fan of Russel Crowe, and I think he did a solid job considering the material he was given. But I came away from the movie feeling that something was lacking. There was no information about John Nash's past, and too much time was spent on showing the effects of Nash's illness on his life. The scenes about his illness tended to get repetitious. And, the major plot device in the movie was taken straight from The Sixth Sense (probably an attempt to get people to see this movie again). Overall, this movie was disappointing--certainly not worth all the rave reviews it is getting now. I would have given this movie three stars, but I had to give it an extra star because of Jennifer Connelly. She stole every scene she was in, and her beauty is simply incredible.
6303921248|5.0|This film truly transports the viewer into Jane Austen's world.  We are swept away into the breathtakingly beautiful 19th century English countryside, to a time where one's &quot;breeding&quot; is above all else in importance, where a woman's every fiber is bent and effort spent on a shrewd marital match, and genteel propriety (or at least the appearance of such) is a characteristic highly regarded and fiercely protected.  <br />The scenery is fantastic, as well as the costuming, and it seems that great attention was paid to even the minutest of details.<br />The actors play their roles superbly, and I believe the casting director must be a genious (although I found Mrs. Bennett almost too annoying altogether.)  Austen's fans will be pleased, I think, at the production's faithfulness to the novel.  Very well-done and enjoyable.
1558807381|4.0|This movie was really quirky.  Before Tom went all Top Gun on us, he was in this.  Although it is a little patched together, I truly agree its a very underrated film.  I remember it being a really cool little ride.  Tim Curry is always good.<br />I must say though, that what me and my friends say really is true, this movie has a lot of errie similarities with the Legend of Zelda.  Think about it, Young Elf boy going to save his princess from the clutches of a beast of a man, and does so through survival. <br />In closing, the acting could have been better, the story could have been more polished, but all and all it was an enjoyable movie.  Very good.  Its cool to catch Link..I mean, Tom Cruise in an early role such as this.
B000002UAX|3.0|This album is okay...but it's no their best.  Check out \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", and \\"The Magical Mystery Tour\\".
B00005RFQ5|5.0|The level of emotion that this album produces among listeners, both good and bad, must mean something.    I can't think of too much wrong with this CD.  I grew up listening to P-funk and their rambling madmen, George Clinton (using various voices and personalities) and Bootsy Collins.  If you are familiar with any of their spoken word craziness, I assure you, none of Prince's voice enhanced rants will cause you any alarm.  Same thing on regarding his views on women.  I mean dayum, as much [junk] as the hip hoppers are talking about women, to give Prince any grief about what I see as his interpretation of his religion, is just really crazy. Is anything he says any worse than P-funk's classic Mothership Connection song, \\"Handcuffs\\"?  I don't think so.    As a practicing bassist, I gotta call it like I see it.  This is his best effort musically in a LONG time.  I am especialy impressed with the recording quality. A very clean and open, not digitally enhanced.  A good example is the first song, \\"Rainbow Children\\".  If you listen closely to the instrumental breakdown at the end you can actually hear Prince call out for the other musicians to come in.  Normally, he would never allow such \\"live\\" accidents onto a studio album.  As everybody else has said, John Blackwell is the BOMB on the drum kit and the album is worth it just to get hipped to him.    I counted two tasty keyboard solos, at least four happening guitar solos and a bass solo by Prince.  Lost what? Certainly not his musical gifts.  You can only complain about this album when you start comparing it to other Prince releases, and even then it still ranks up there.  It is so head and shoulders above any other R&B release this year that it is comical.    Personal highlights include:    \\"Muse 2 the Pharoh\\" and \\"Mellow\\" - a little something to let the \\"neo-soul\\" ... like Bilal and D'Angelo what the real deal is supposed to sound like.    \\"The Work\\" and \\"1+1+1=3\\" - classic funk.  The former is in the classic James Brown style, the latter is vintage 80's style Prince, with the keyboards and everything.  Just like you like it served up to you.    \\"Everywhere\\" - I just love this song and I don't care if he is talking about feeling God everywhere.  Great singing from him and the background vocals and a KILLER drum riff by Mr. Blackwell.    \\"She Loves me for me\\" - a tidy, spare love song. He plays a nice clean \\"strat\\" style guitar line which gives the tune a \\"Little Wing/Castles Made of Sand\\" feel to it.  Simple and pretty.    Every song has something musically in it that I find interesting.  But then again, I am a musician so I am not bound by the normal fan/hero thing that some people get into.    Finally, the references to Miles Davis are interesting.  I have always considered Prince to be the Miles Davis of the genre.  Think about it.  Miles Davis was always being asked to play his old [stuff]and always telling people to, ..., that is old music, I already made it.\\"    You wanna hear Prince sound like he did in Purple Rain?  Go buy Purple Rain then. You wanna hear where Prince is at in 2001/2?  Buy this one.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks marked a very special time for TV. It is a very rare moment when the medium actually delivers on the promise. The first few seasons of the X-Files, the entire run of Babylon 5, the original Star Trek and the entire series run of Twin Peaks. This release would be perfect if only the 2 hour premiere were included. I still give it a five star rating because we fans finally get to see the series in vivid digital quality with 5.1 surround sound. Just one question--when is season 2 to be released? I want the entire series on DVD and I want it NOW!!!!! Including the pilot episode---please?????
B00000INEX|3.0|This is the first tape in the series that I have seen.  I was not at all impressed with the sound quality on the tape.  The music really vibrated through the speakers, even at low volume.  The makers of this video went out to a novelty gift store to buy the props for this video (lightning ball, rainbow strobe, back-flipping dog, etc.), which made it seem cheap from an adult perspective.<br />Fortunately, my 3-month-old baby has not yet developed very discerning tastes.  He watches the video quietly and seems to enjoy it.  As long as cost is within your budget, then I would recommend this video for kids under a year, though other reviewers seem to think other tapes in this series are better.
B00005RIKD|5.0|I personally have a very eclectic taste in music.  My collection includes such artists as Barbra Streisand, Creed, Miles Davis, John Williams movie scores, and many more, but I have never bought an album by Sting- until now.  I have always admired his voice and held out for an album to strike a personal chord with me.  This one did just that!  <BR>I don't much care for live recordings because they usually sound so distant and cold, and the aplause can be too overpowering, but this one is so personal and makes me feel like I'm in a jazz club hanging out with Sting and his team of musicians.  What an amazing album!  I am especially impressed with Sting's versatility in ''Moon Over Bouron Street''- what talent! In the few days I have had it, this album has quickly become one of my all-time favorite albums.
0553106635|5.0|I would have to say without a doubt that A Storm of Swords is the finest fantasy tale I have read in the entirety of my life.<br />The story is grand, the characters realistic and likeable, and the world is so complex.  Not only that, but the story isn't the traditional fantasy formula where one hero uses his magical powers, or his magic sword to defeat legions of evil beings, but it is a bit more realistic.<br />Armies battle, heroes die and strange things lurk in the darkness =)<br />If you like fantasy at all, do yourself a favor and read this series.  <br /> I wish A Feast of Crows (4th book title i THINK) would hurry up and come out, I hate being left hanging!

0553712837|1.0|This book by John Grisham was described to my wife and myself by her stepmother as &quot;uproarious&quot; and impossible to put down. After Christmas, armed with a gift card to Barnes and Noble, I noticed the book in the store, and, reminded of our conversation, decided &quot;Why not?&quot; and purchased it.<br />My wife and I decided that, since it was a fairly short read, we would read a few chapters to each other before bedtime, looking forward to the fun promised. I have to say I was disillusioned by the time I got to the middle of the book, and the &quot;No man is poor who has friends&quot; ending, which began with &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and is perpetuated by people searching for the true meaning of Christmas without having to find something original did nothing to save the book.<br />The protagonists are Luther and Nora Krank, whose daughter, Blair, has just left for Peru and the Peace Corps after Thanksgiving. Luther is an accountant, and after totalling up the prior years' expenses on useless cards, presents and party expenses, decides that he is tired of blowing a good chunk of his salary every year for nothing. Since Blair's gone, he figures there is little reason to stick around, and he talks his perpetually naggy wife Nora into agreeing to take a cruise to the Caribbean over Christmas with him and to &quot;skip Christmas&quot; this year.<br />Luther's neighbors are a self-important lot, concerned more with appearances than with the actual meaning of Christmas, and, once word gets out that there will be no annual Krank Christmas party, and that they will not be putting up their Frosty the Snowman statue on their roof, thus screwing their neighborhood out of winning the neighborhood Christmas decoration competition, things rapidly go downhill.<br />Without trying to give too much of the plot away, let me just say that Nora, who agrees to the cruise in the first place, is a &quot;fly in the ointment&quot; throughout; a constant worrier who is, like the neighbors, more concerned with looking good, as far as her Christmas participation is concerned, than with being sensible. Lest this review be considered &quot;sexist&quot;: if Luther had been portrayed in the same fashion he would have annoyed me equally.<br />The neighbors activate a networked campaign to alternately stalk and harass the Kranks for their non-participation in their street's Christmas activities. This did not make me smile but, rather, made me think that if this sort of behavior occurred in the real world rather than in a book, most of the offending neighbors would find themselves in court defending themselves.<br />I didn't find ONE character in the book, from the Kranks, to their neighbors, to their daughter, to the police(who should have been ending the neighbors' harassment but instead aided and abetted it)that was likable or memorable.<br />Sometimes books written by a well-known author are taken as masterpieces simply on the strength of the author's name. This book was simply unfunny, and while I can take a joke as well as the next guy, I spent the WHOLE book looking for at least ONE &quot;uproarious&quot; section. I failed in my search.<br />From my perspective, you would do yourself well to avoid the herd mentality, save yourself a few bucks, and SKIP &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;., like the neighbors, more concerned with looking good, as far as her Christmas participation is concerned, than with being sensible.

B00005LC1H|5.0|I'm a huge fan of British sitcoms.. this is probably tied with Father Ted as my fave.  I received this set for Christmas - and I've watched it countless times already... I just wish there were more than twelve episodes. No show has ever made me laugh this hard.. especially the final episode.  I was in stitches the entire time...  Definitely don't miss this set - this show is a classic!

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Wow, what a movie.  I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD...  while it was at the theater I kept saying it didn't look like my kind of movie.  For some reason - a whim, I guess - I decided to buy the DVD... I watched it twice in a row that night.  I fell in love with this movie... The music, the acting, the scenary, the costumes, everything...  I watched it about four more times that weekend.  It's become one of my absolute faves.  Never have I felt such awe while watching a movie.<br />When I told my best friend about it, her immediate reaction was.. &quot;No no, not my kind of movie.&quot;  I just grinned and told her that's exactly what I thought too before I watched it.  We'll see if I turn her into a fan...
0375703764|5.0|A metaphor that comes to mind when describing this book involves Chris Tucker from the movie Rush Hour.  That's right.  Chris Tucker.  He stands, like the reader, braced for a fight with fists cocked when his is struck by an unidentified assailant.  Disoriented, he asks, &quot;Which one of y'all kicked me?&quot;  This scene is a little like  reading this book, equal parts, funny, disorienting and somehow, very realistic.<br />  This is a book that is truly awful in the original etymological sense of the word.  It is a work that is full of awe and inspires awe.  Awful.  I found myself hurtled through its pages, bounced back and forth through its copious footnotes as I watched the book itself unfold, violently rejecting categorization or description, demanding to be held at arms length, defining itself in terms of itself as truly alive and truly novel.<br />  I am reminded of another book as real and powerful (complete with different colored print and fully engaged character who reads a story and becomes part of the story) Michael Ende's Never Ending Story.<br />  Many of the reviewers here have decided this work is unoriginal, but I have to say that even if Danielewski has not invented the form, he excels at it and uses it to tell a horrifying story, convey some great essayistic points and to tell several great stories which are ultimately synthesized into one great book.
B00005RFAI|5.0|When I first saw Pink a few years ago, I dismissed her as another bubble-gum pop sensation that would likely end up on cheesey venues with Britney Spears, NSync, etc.  And that was certainly Pink's worst nightmare.  &quot;Sorry, Pink&quot; :)  For Pink is definitely not in that category by any means.  Her gutsiness reminds me of how Madonna used her pop skills in the early 80s to later emerge as an artist who expressed herself with integrity as an artist, yet amazingly had the capability to do this in a bold, accessible, fashionable, intimate, irresistible way.<br />This album is not another R&amp;B album like her debut.  It's really quite difficult to describe, but I would say it has more of a rock format.  It definitely has a modern, fresh feel to it that reminds me of a new-millenium Aretha Franklin.  She's gutsy and bold.  She comes through with integrity and sincerity in her lyrics that are quite admirable.<br />There really isn't a disappointing track at all on this album.  My favorites are the super-ballad &quot;Eventually,&quot;  rock-infused &quot;Eighteen Wheeler&quot;,  &quot;Respect,&quot; and the bluesy &quot;Going to California.&quot;<br />Folks, this album is a treat.  Feast yourself for Pink in 2002.  For she has a very bright future ahead of her.  We love you Pink!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|In her third album &quot;Britney&quot; she expresses for her need to show the world that she is not a sissy. In her first album she sort of gives herself pitty through songs that are slow but enjoyable. Now don't get me wrong, I loooved that CD. But in this album she is blowing everybody away with her upbeat up-to-date album. All of her songs are great, stupendous, reaching for the sky kind of songs with the exception of a few.<br />1.i'm a slave 4 U - great song has one cuss word but it is'nt really one: h***<br />2.overprotected - shows everyone that Britney Spears is not a little kid anymore, she is not even a teenager and that she doesn't need so much protection from people and the world. This song has the second and last cuss word: d***<br />3.lonely - O.K. good but not that good. I can't really describe it.<br />4.i'm not a girl, not yet a women - Again saying that she is not a child any more, she is not a teenager(well sort of) but she is not a women. She is saying that she wants to be set free into the world but people keep on telling her that she is not an adult yet and that she is not going to be pampered like a girl so she is trying to show her inbetween older teenager emotions.<br />5.boys - has a good beat, O.K. <br />6.anticipating - great song,teriffic lyrics,great rythm/beat.<br />7.i love rock'n'roll - great remake of the earlier edition<br />8.cinderella - showing how she does not want to be bossed around any more, showing self expression. one of the best rythms (the beggining shows why it is called cinderella. it sounds like her going down the steps to meet somebody's needs)<br />9.let me be - good lyrics, great beat<br />10.bombastic love - showing that she wants somebody to love her so much that it is like in a movie<br />11.that's where you take me - has a good beat, not many words though<br />12.what it's like to be me - bad beggining but Britney makes up for it near the end. In the way that the first few words are said, they sound like NellyFurtado saying his?/her? name in &quot;GET UR FREAK ON&quot; on the Tombraider Soundtrack (If you have heard it)<br />     All in all this is a great CD and it would be wrong to pass up the chance to buy this CD.
B00004Z459|4.0|Although they don't have a chance at beating U2 they got a Grammy Nod! Amazing
B00005JKES|2.0|I would sooner go back to see a movie at a later date than to miss the first five minutes of it.  When I sat down to watch my most eagerly anticipated DVD since I have owned my player, I was almost numb with disbelief.  How could &quot;Twin Peaks-The First Season&quot; be complete without the singular most crucial element, the pilot episode?  I own hundreds of DVDs and this is, without a doubt, the most botched ripoff on the market today.  If there had been a warning that this mockery of a 'first season' did NOT include the pilot, I wouldn't have bought it.  I can't even bring myself to watch it, I am so infuriated.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This film examines the street racing subculture and provides ample thrills for the 25 and under set.  Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.<br />The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.<br />The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload.  Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience.  There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on \\"Miami Vice\\", has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.  <br />Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.<br />Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate.  Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.<br />The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\", the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's.  Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.<br />If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his characterin a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.<br />Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\", is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.<br />This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets.
B00005ATQC|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut is a haunting experience. As to if you like it or not... you certainly wont be forgetting it too soon. Its imagery was perfectly framed, the music bold and appropriate, the colour was very obtuse and the acting impeccable. The sex in the film is never truly erotic, rather always concerned with danger, risk and confrontation. Kubricks visual style has never been so vibrantly alive. His elegant tracking, zooming and lengthy shots all create an atmosphere of complete frustration; everything is slightly off centre. Thankyou Mr. Kubrick for not handing your film to us on a silver platter, as so many directors do today. Thankyou for respecting our intelligence. This is Kubricks true indent on the history of film and it is matched only by David Lynch. The two leave us - the audience- to fill in the gaps, to hem the story ... This is the greatest film-audience relationship a director can create. When Cruise and Kidman were lost, we the audience were lost with them. What an achievement. It is a dissapointment this film wasnt recognised come Oscar time- I guess its a statement in itself of the franchise that appears to be gutting the spirit out of Hollywood. This is Kubricks best since &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;

B000051S3H|2.0|This version of Jane Eyre was not the best.  First, I had the distinct impression that George C. Scott played himself.  He really did not get the essence of the character that he played.  <br />Second, the movie seemed more like a remake of the Orson Welles version than a fresh telling of the story.  Many of the elements of this one were clearly taken from the Welles version.  <br />Overall, if I had to choose a version of this story, I would probably take the Timothy Dalton version, which although the male lead may not look the part, is the truest version to the novel in terms of acting and atmosphere.<br />This one was ok, but only just.

I read this book while on vacation at our cabin. It was a perfect summer read, or beach read. But I would get it from the library instead of spending your money on it.

B00003CXXJ|4.0|SHREK is a computer-animated fairy tale.  It is a computer-animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers.  It is a computer-animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers, and not a Disney production.  It is a computer-animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers, not a Disney production, and is proud of it.  In fact, it is a Dreamworks Production, the company started by what's his name---you know---ah yes---Steven Spielberg.  The movie is based on the book by William Steig.  SHREK is directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson.<br />SHREK is unlike Disney in the sense that this story is a fractured fairy tale, while Disney has a more serious tone to its pictures; nevertheless, SHREK is supposed to be fractured.  The viewer can assume that the tale will be fractured due to its two leading fractured comedians, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy.  It is interesting to note that all through the movie, Dreamworks takes potshots at its rival Disney with cutting remarks and jokes, as well as fairytales in general.<br />The story line reveals SHREK living peacefully in the woods and content to stay that way until a band of outcast characters ---many of which are Disney---invade his swamp.  When SHREK discovers that the characters were evicted from the kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), he makes haste to the castle for a conference with the king.<br />In the meantime, Farquaad has been frantically searching for a wife, but not any wife.  He must have a princess, someone of royalty; therefore, he consults the Magic Mirror from Snow White who gives him a choice of three available princesses.  In this humorous scene, Farquaad settles on Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful young lass, living high in a castle tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon; therefore, it becomes  SHREK's mission to rescue her and return her to Farquaad.  Assisted by his crazy sidekick, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the story takes on some interesting twists and turns, infused with sharp wit and humor.<br />THE GOOD...  This is a funny movie, full of one-liners aimed specifically at the adult audience.  There are flatulent faux pas for the male segment, especially for teenage boys, who love this sort of thing.  However, SHREK (Mike Myers) appeared to give up his seat in the humor section to Donkey (Eddie Murphy), who was rambunctiously funny, but nothing close to Robin Williams' performance as the Genie in Disney's ALADDIN.<br />The animation is similar to that of ANTZ, a very good computer-generated work of art, in which DREAMWORKS specializes.  This makes it a very entertaining film for all.  As for a moral to the story, there is one, and it gives meaning and substance to this fractured fairytale; however, this must not be divulged by the reviewer.<br />THE BAD...  One really needs to pay close attention to the humor, some is inappropriate for young kids, but with all the animated action, children will more than likely not be attuned to it.it and humor.    <br />THE GOOD...

B000001FTQ|5.0|This album has one of the best live recordings of the song &quot;Bad&quot; from the Unforgettable Fire.  I really began to appreciate U2 when I started to listen to their live performances.  Live at Red Rocks is a better album, just becuase of the impact it had and its timing.  But, this is a good buy for any U2 fan.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I started watching this movie by chance when it came on TV and by the end i was so shaken up i turned the TV off and ran upstairs to the safe confines of my room...and I`m almost 30! Everything about this movie makes for a great horror film from the inspired casting of a leading lady you actually care about and the spine-tingling direction to a genuinely chilling finale. Trust me..this is the scariest slasher movie of all time and in my opinion will and can never be bettered-what more can i say-just buy the DVD!
B00005B36H|5.0|With easily their most melodic, emotionally powerful album, Tool is back with Lateralus.  This album is not as angry or in your face as previous works, but seems to radiate a different level of emotional intensity.  The songs are rich, compelling and epic in proportion.  They seep into you.  It's really an amazing piece of art.  There's some nice synth work, woven in with the complex song structures and moving vocals (as always!).  Highly recommended!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Although an incubus is an evil spirit that creeps up on sleeping persons, like a nightmare, the band Incubus is nothing of the sort. &quot;Morning View&quot; is an excellent display of their talents both lyrically and musically. It seems that after two years in the dark since their last record, Incubus has better crept up on us with this more mature record. The songs are well put together. The lyrics are meaningful. And Brandon's singing has improved. &quot;Morning View&quot; is very different from Incubus' last album, &quot;Make Yourself,&quot; yet it seems more mature and diverse. Listen to &quot;Morning View&quot; by Incubus. Hopefully you'll love it as much as I do.
0553106635|5.0|When I started reading this book, I could not put it down. The best thing about it is that you really don't know who is going to survive. In this book alone, many of the main characters are killed off, and most of them came as a complete surprise to me. It has left me waiting anxiously for part four to come out, so I can find out what happens to my favourite characters.<BR>And that's another brilliant aspect of the book. Even the enemies are likeable in a way. I don't want some of them to die, expecially the character called Littlefinger!
B00005NW02|5.0|This album is mind blowing and beyond increadable! The album is captavating and seeing them in concert is more intense than imaginable!
B000000OU0|5.0|Well, this is an awesome CD whether or not your an Eagles fan or not. If you are, there's no doubt you have to get it. But even if you're not wild about the Eagles and like '70s soft rock, I would give this a try. Almost all of the songs are better than the originals. My favourite is &quot;Learn To Be Still&quot;. I also love &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, &quot;In The City&quot;, &quot;New York Minute&quot;, and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, the last one unfortunately didn't get released on the cd. I suggest getting the video as well, it was incredible to watch. These guys just rule :)
B00000099Y|5.0|Wow is all I can say after listening to this album many times.<br />I had to change this review because I had spoke of this album as being bad and overrated. I was wrong.  When I first heard this album, I hated it and immediately got into bad moods.  I tried listening to it again to see if I'd like it and wow, I found many great songs: (Stinkfist, Eulogy, H, and Aenima.) ....but I still felt in a bad mood after listening to it.  After a thousand more listens, I finally found the genius in the album.  And wow, I was amazed, and finally liked ALL the other songs: 46 & 2, Hooker, jimmy, Pushit, (Yes, I know the appropriate name.) Third Eye, and even Dier Eir Von.  <br />And wow, I'm amazed at the deepness of the album.  Drumming is godly in this album, and the music itself is amazing and it now puts me in a good mood rather than a bad mood.  The lyrics are great yet they don't \\"change my life\\". <br />All I have to say is that wow.  This album takes a lot to access, but after you do, it is amazing.
0385505833|3.0|As I look through the reviews of 'Skipping Christmas' I understand why the response is so mixed. My feeling is that many readers have expected a typical Grisham-style book and have ended up with less than they had hoped for. Skipping Christmas is NOT typical Grisham. John Grisham has taken a light-hearted look at the reactions when a couple decide to give Christmas a miss and go on a cruise instead.<br />Where the story falls down is in the detail. We are told that Luther Krank is only skipping Christmas to avoid the cost (not because Christmas is humbug). Why, then, would he avoid placing a Frosty on his roof? Why would he not go to the (no cost) firm's office party? There are lots of other details, too, that don't fit into Luther's original 'plan'.<br />Though Skipping Christmas is just a short, light-hearted read that lasts a few hours, I didn't find it particularly satisfying nor, despite the potential, did I find much humor in John Grisham's execution of the plot. It's marginally amusing but not much else.

0345413377|5.0|When reading this series, I was continually surprised and amazed at the depth and scope that Pullman takes on. In this retelling of Paradise Lost, Lyra and Will go on a journey that takes them to the ends of reality and the reader loves every minute of it!<br />This whole series is simply magnificent and the best books I've read since Dune. A good way to compare this series is a combination of Alice in Wonderland/Dune/CS Lewis. These are the best books I've read in years and am not just recommending them to all my friends, I actually purchased Golden Compass for all my friends and family for Christmas this year!
B00005NWM3|4.0|First of all I must tell you this is not a great album, certainly it won't be remembered after the &quot;How you remind me&quot; fever fades away. Some of the things that make this album fail are:<BR>1. Songs sound pretty much alike.<BR>2. Lyrics have a serious lack of creativity.<BR>3. It's not up to date, it seems like an 80's record sometimes.<BR>Other reviewers have stated the arguments above in previous reviews. But to them and to myself I reply &quot;So what?&quot;<BR>Sometimes we just need to stop analizing the music, sometimes we just need to stop trying to &quot;feel&quot; the lyrics. Some albums are meant to make a difference, to innovate, to make you think, and some albums are just meant to make you have a little bit of fun.<BR>I am not a fan of &quot;hard&quot; rock, in fact what made me buy this album was (what a surprise) &quot;How you remind me&quot;. The first time I listened to it at home I thought that it was a waste of money. The next day, however, I popped it into my car stereo and then I heard track 1 &quot;Never Again&quot;. Within 2 minutes of the song I was trying to sing along. This album is just fun and it makes you wanna drive fast. It may not be creative, but it sure can make you have a good time. Other highlights include:<BR>1. The singer can really scream in a very cool way. Just try to sing along in &quot;Never Again&quot; like he does.<BR>2. Great gitar riffs, specially on &quot;Money Bought&quot;<BR>3. &quot;How you remind me&quot;<BR>So the singer has a really bad haircut, again so what? You are not buying a poster, you are buying a CD. <BR>The bottom line is, if you are into banging your head and singing along without worrying if the song's message is deep or the singer's hair is fashionable, buy this album.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is a story about the journey of a man as well as a light review on the workings of Rome. I watch it over and over, and even my most &quot;action movie&quot; fearing friends love it. The power of Russell Crowes character is moving even in its 15th viewing. An unbelievable circumstance is made highly believable primarily because of his performance.<br />I took the opportunity to rent a similar story, Spartacus, recently. I expected that the thing that would make me like Gladiator more would be the special effects and exciting battle sequences. However, it turned out that the sheer believability of Crowe's Maximus just made Kirk Douglas' Spartacus pale miserably in comparison.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm a girl and I heard some great stuff about Linkin Park so I got their Cd. Never had I heard such great music! From the moment I heard &quot;Papercut&quot; till &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; I was totally mezmorized by their songs.I lisen to the CD almost every day and I never skip any of the tracks (except #11 which isn't really a singing track to me) They are definatly the best out there right now so I recommend this CD to everyone!!!!!
068981528X|5.0|The three little wolves and the big bad pig tells the classic story of the three litttle pigs and th big bad wolf, with a few twists. Instead of three little pigs, three little wolves have to contend with the treacherous big bad pig. The wolves also use nonconventional methods to build their houses, and the pig uses it's modern ways to knock them down.<BR> The antics of the wolves making houses out of brick, cement, and metal, as well as the pig destroy their hard work with a sleedgehammer, pnuematic drill, and dynamite, controls most of the comical antics of this story. The zaniness of the events that occur will leave the reader laugh and imbued with happiness.<BR> While containing many modern elements, the three little wolves and the big bad pig still contains classic yet crucial parts of the original tale. for instance, in the beginning, the three are told to go make a life for themselves by their mother, as well as the huffing, the puffing, and blowing the house in. <BR> From page to page, this well-written book will make you think you know the ending, but surprise you with a totally different one! The story won't keep you on the edge of your seat, but rather on the floor laughing at this hilarious book.  Enjoy!
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen's greatest album should be the guide to how to be a rock band. Like the Beatles, Bowie, and in some ways, like Led Zeppelin, Queen pushed their skills and style. Bob Dylan did it too. I wish today's bands had the guts to avoid the rut of writing for a demographic, and wrote such variety and quality.<br />As you click through the samples, you'll remember a lot of the songs from the days when FM radio played real music and not just the short pop songs.<br />The rock is solid, but they crank through more than a few power chords. The melodies behind &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;I'm in Love with My Car&quot; are delicately woven, yet don't lose the fact that they are rock tunes.<br />&quot;The Prophet's Song&quot; is an incredible multi-layered song competing with &quot;Bohemian Rapsody&quot; for articulating intense images amid a storyline.<br />And &quot;Bohemian Rapsody&quot;... simply one of the greatest songs ever.<br />I fully recommend &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; by Queen.<br />Anthony Trendl
0385335482|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I know you know the plot from all the other reviews so I'm just going to say how I felt about it.  I'm the type of person who enjoys artistic, deeply thought out books and movies.  This is not one of those books - but I loved it anyway!  I felt like I was there with Bex, like she was my friend.  I walked her through every chapter, and laughed out loud and all the situations I found her in.  I let my mother borrow it, saying she absoultely HAD to read it...my mother is not a reader, but she loved this book.  When I went to London, I found myself in all the places I read about in the book, and throughout my stay I made sure to look for the places I missed in the beginning.  I read it again on the flight home, simply because I had so much fun the first time.  It was just as much fun the second.  Lay back, read it, and throw your head back and laugh from the heart.  It just feels good.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I have to give credit to the marketing guys at Capitol. They did a terrific job of promoting this two-disc career retrospective of the ultimate album-oriented band. When this came out, I immediately bought it. Why? Good question. After all, I already owned the box set Shine On. I already had all of their albums through 1994's The Division Bell. [I passed on their two post-Waters live albums, however--and nothing from either of them is included here.]  I guess I'm just a sucker for any repackaging of any of my favorite artists from the Sixties and Seventies, and Pink Floyd is certainly one of the best.  While there is nothing new here, it is a great overview of the band from 1967's Piper at the Gates of Dawn (&quot;Bike&quot;) through 1994's The Division Bell--obviously David Gilmore had a big say in getting three of his tracks from that album on here. [Only Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall or more represented with four tracks each.] There are a couple of omissions that keep this collection from being truly complete.  There is nothing from either of Pink Floyd's soundtracks, 1969's More and 1972's Obscured by Clouds--&quot;Free Four&quot; would have been a great addition from the latter.  Two other albums not represented are 1969's Ummagumma and 1970's Atom Heart Mother, although the album art is deeply indebted to Ummagumma. Overall, this is over two-and-a-half hours of prime Floyd, and if you don't mind hearing these tracks out of the context of their original albums this makes for great listening. Sit back and let Barrett, Waters, Mason, Gilmore and Wright take you on an amazing journey. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005IC2H|5.0|This ranks right up there with anything by Radiohead as far as an excellent headphone experience.  Absolutely otherworldly!
B00005RYKU|3.0|It looks like a chick flick, and it is a little. It was a good story though, well thought out, creepy and even chilling at times. Leelee is a little hottie and Stellan Skarsgard is always a solid actor. 3 1/2 stars actually.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I purchased the Limited Edition solely for the lyrics to the songs (I confess, I'm the sing-a-long type!) and I am thrilled with this CD.  My one problem is PROOFREADING; apparently no one at Reprise Records has the time to proofread.  As a result, some of the lines are gobbledygook but it's nothing that a pencil can't fix.  I would also have liked a guide to Elvish pronunciation, but just by listening to the track a couple of times you can get the hang of it.<BR>The music itself is breathtaking and gorgeously performed; Shore's score wraps you in its simple yet majestic beauty.  It's difficult to tear yourself away from the CD player!<BR>Regardless of whether you buy the Limited Edition (comes in a leather folder thingy) or the jewel case version, you won't be disappointed!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I totally love her new album! I don't usually buy a single artist cd, because I usually will regret it. So I usually buy various artists albums. But Shakira's new single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; is the reason why I brought her cd...and I haven't stop listening to it! I am now actually finding time almost everyday just to listen to her cd! The music and the lyrics of the songs, are just..wow! Track #2 &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot; is my next favourite song on her album. Very touching and emotional. And Track #11 &quot;Eyes like yours (Ojos Asi)&quot; is just great to dance to. Also, some recognition to Track #9 &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot;; very meaningful. Except for the 4 Spanish songs on the album, which I have no clue what the heck the lyrics mean. But even though I don't understand Spanish, I still listen to them because I love the rhythm and the music of these 4 Spanish songs. I actually have tried to sing along with the Spanish lyrics in my hands! It is that good! And I don't know why some people are comparing her to Britney. Britney doesn't write her own songs! Don't compare Shakira to Britney just because Shakira dyed her hair! In my opinon, Shakira is better than her!
B00004XONN|2.0|Certainly a band deserves credit for exploring new styles, and deviating from what they may be &quot;expected&quot; to play.  Bearing that in mind, Radiohead's Kid A is a noteworthy, if unsuccessful foray into &quot;electro-minimalism&quot;, or whatever you want to call it.  It sounds to me like Radiohead changed direction simply because they were afraid of trying to top the incredible and more unique OK Computer.  While the &quot;new&quot; sound is successful on certain tunes, others suggest that Radiohead possibly hurried the ideas onto tape under the guise of minimalism.<br />If you liked Kid A, or even feel that it fell a little short, try some of these artists (and realize that Kid A isn't the unique masterpiece some will make it out to be): Aphex Twin, Brian Eno and Bjork's &quot;Vespertine&quot; are generally conceptually stronger than Kid A.  Or go further back into electronic's roots and listen to Kraftwerk, Neu! or Suicide.  Those not averse to classical music might find Philip Glass rewarding.
B00005OM4N|4.0|It took me awhile to get into Britney.  I wanted to hate her for her annoying pop sound and sugar coated songs (see the first album).  Then Opps came out and I started to like her.  This album, however, is by far the most fun and mature.  A lot of people don't like it because its not the same sugar-coated britney that they were used to.  Its different but its really good.  I think that if this hadn't been her third album it would have sold more than the other two, but the audience is changing and she's changing and the two might not be going in the same direction.  its a lot of fun if you give it a chance...<BR>she's not mozart, she's a pop star, let her be.  bombastic love, anticipating, boys, and what its like to be me are probably my favorite songs on the CD.  she lost a star for doing &quot;i love rock n roll.&quot;
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have seen in quite some time.  I am a big Russell Crowe fan and if he doesn't &quot;win&quot; an Oscar for this movie, something is very wrong.  The story is moving and beautifully done by Ron Howard (who should also walk away with Best Director).  It is not only a story of illness, done with compassion and humor, but a love story unlike any I have seen.  Don't miss this movie.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This film is the best film of 2001! It is a must see for anyone even remotely intereted in cars. Excellent!
B000002LCU|3.0|Where this late eighties recording was a vast improvement over much of George's later solo work it is still not a particularly brilliant recording. There are some truly terrific compositions both clever and well written. The problem lies primarily in the production. Jeff Lynne's heavy hand dominates the sound leaving this potentially strong effort rendered light and poppish.  It is also a pity that George's guitar playing had grown so rusty. He was a truly unique, creative and passionate guitarist. There are but faint glimmers of his former brilliance. Restrained perhaps by an aging hand but still tasteful and expressive if not fluid and involved. Worth owning perhaps, but his finest period is to be found  in the early 70's recordings with All Things Must Pass (a masterpiece) through Extra Texture. Where E.T., Dark Horse and Living In The Material world all contained the occassional weak cut there were plenty of soulful and moving tunes. Beatle or otherwise George's unique voice was once that of genius....Simon
B00003CX5P|5.0|The Trade Federation has formed a blockade around the peaceful planet of Naboo.  Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are dispatched to negotiate.  When the Trade Federation begins landing an invasion army on the planet the Jedi realize that there is more at stake than a simple trade dispute.  With the Queens (Natalie Portman) life in danger they must hurry back to the planet and warn her and the people of Naboo.<br />Star Wars is finally on DVD and Lucasfilm and Fox have put together a great one.  This is the first film released in Dolby Digital Surround EX.  It is the best Dolby Digital mix that I have ever heard.  The surround speakers are constantly active so crank up the volume and enjoy.  The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The picture looks amazing, the only fault is the occasional edge enhancement.  With that aside, this is still a reference quality disk.  There are several special features spread over the two disks.  The highlights are seven deleted scenes, \\"The Beginning\\" documentary, five featurettes and an audio commentary by George Lucas and Company.  The audio commentary was excellent and I really like how they spread each persons voice to a different speaker and also used subtitles so you knew who was talking.<br />When I first saw The Phantom Menace at theaters I was a bit disappointed.  But I was expecting quite a lot.  After several viewing at home the film has really grown on me.  Even if you hate the movie you can't deny that this is one of the best DVD's ever produced.  All the special features are great and I can't remember the last time I watched all the features more than once on any other disk.  For the Star Wars fans who did not like the film, they may enjoy the supplements so go ahead and give it a try.
B00005MAM2|4.0|I was extremely excited about the release of the &quot;special edition&quot; of Otomo Katsuhiro-san's &quot;AKIRA&quot;! I was also looking quite forward to the &quot;new English dubbing&quot; -- but therein lies the problem, and the reason why I (and many others) feel that it falls short of the coveted &quot;Five Stars&quot; it so legitimately deserves.<br />Although I am appreciative of the fact that the new overdubbing is more faithful to the original Japanese dialogue, many of us (myself included) were introduced to this spectacular film years ago with its American release in theatres, and most if not all of us have some very cherished memories of the film's original English dubbing. One of the things we had all looked forward to and hoped for with the release of &quot;Akira&quot; in DVD format was not only the &quot;new&quot; English dialogue, but also the *inclusion* of the &quot;original&quot; English dialogue so many of us are familiar with!<br />Sadly, this was not to be. I somehow suspect that the decision to do this was made intentionally-- as sort of a DVD version of the &quot;Old Coke/New Coke&quot; scam --in an attempt to rake in a few extra bucks from all of us old fogey stogies with the fond memories. If that is indeed the case, then I am ashamed to admit that I will be one of those who will be first in line plunk down my hard earned bucks to relive the memory.<br />The &quot;original&quot; English dub, though less literal and somewhat more paraphrasical in its delivery, actually &quot;connected&quot; better with an English-language audience more so than the &quot;new&quot; version, while still remaining faithful to the overall sense of the original Japanese dialogue.<br />One of the things I DO like about the new dubbed version, which some others will likely disagree with me on, has to do with the re-assignment of voices to the &quot;Numbers&quot; (Takashi, Kiyoko, and Masaru): The little child voices, statures and mannerisms are nicely contrasted against the aged hair, facial features and frailties they possess.<br />Final recommendation for the &quot;special edition&quot;?: Buy it, Rent it, or Bum it off of a friend, but by all means SEE it! -- And make every effort to do likewise whenever Pioneer decides to get around to producing the new &quot;enhanced visual&quot; version with the old &quot;original English&quot; dialogue.<br />P.S. -- Be sure to check out the special feature regarding the &quot;Music of Akira&quot;; It is a very informative and a very enjoyable piece.ed against the aged hair, facial features and frailties they possess. <br />Final recommendation for the &quot;special edition&quot;?: Buy it, Rent it, or Bum it off of a friend, but by all means SEE it! -- And make every effort to do likewise whenever Pioneer decides to get around to producing the new &quot;enhanced visual&quot; version with the old &quot;original English&quot; dialogue. <br />P.S. -- Be sure to check out the special feature regarding the &quot;Music of Akira&quot;; It is a very informative and a very enjoyable piece.

B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD has really shown that Britney Spears has matured.  Her other two albums were good, but this one was definetly the best. She has matured a lot more with her voice, style,  and way of thought. I bought this CD the first day it came out and I was really surprised and satisfied. I listen to this CD almost every day and I love it. I gave it five stars because it a a truly fun and enjoyable expeirience to listen to her and her amazing voice. Buy it!

B000002JSP|5.0|it's a shame that zep's last two studio albums, Presence and In Through the Out Door, are so overlooked in the shadow of graffitti and their early achievements. Out Door is an exceptional piece of music, showcasing a new angle with john paul jones's direction. people complain that his synth was too prominent on the whole album, but page is still hot on guitar, plant still belts, and bonham still thunders. unlike the beatles or pink floyd in their latter days, led zeppelin was a group that worked on all songs with all four members contributing. there was no true leader in the studio, except with page as producer.<BR>'in the evening' is a hellraising opener, saturated with distortion. 'fool in the rain' is a georgous upbeat piano song with one of page's more distinct solos. a largely underrated song, 'carouselambra' is a synth ride through ten minutes of raunchy rock. 'all my love' is plant's attempt at redemption of his son karac's death. all in all, In Through the Out Door is a wonderful album, the last image of a legendary band beginning their run to rule the world in the 80s with a brilliant and exciting and lush new sound. with bonham's death, however, the world would never see where they would go. this album is exceptional and should not be overlooked. brilliant.

630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady, one of this last big budget musicals of all time.  Adapted from the play Pygmalion, this is the rags to riches story of Eliza Doolittle (played marvelously by Audrey Hepburn). Watch this poor 'gutter snipe' be transformed into the talk of the ball by speech professor Henry Higgins (played to the hammy peak by Rex Harrison). The sets are breathtaking, the costumes are remarkable and the cast superb.  Audrey Hepburn would be proud of this DVD.  All the hard work of voice lessons for this movie are now paying off.  As if My Fair Lady wasn't perfect enough, now you can hear Hepburns very own voice implemented back into the movie for a couple more songs.  This alone would make it worth buying.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie and its soundtrack as well!  It is definitely not your typical love story or musical but it is wonderfully made.  Vivid colours, great dance sequences, creative use of song.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Danes/DiCaprio version of Romeo &amp; Juliet and anyone who just likes a good, original musical with modern music.
6300215814|5.0|This film is loosely based on Truman Capotes book.  Audrey Hepburn not only stars, but makes this movie her own.  She plays Holly Golightly, a misguided farm girl who is trying to avoid being pinned down in life.  Hepburn's grace and beauty are the perfect off-set for the sadly alone Golightly.  George Peppard adds to the mix by playing Paul Varjak, a writer and eventual love interest.  The interaction by the tragic Hepburn and the near-fatherly Peppard will grab your eyes and hold your heart.  You'll even be singing the simple but melodic 'Moon River' by the end.  This all around winners charm may forever be unparalleled.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Yes, this album is good to listen it on your car when your driving and watching a beautiful sunset on the horizon, but there are some songs and albums omited. What happened with More, Ummagumma (specially Careful With That Axe Eugene), Atom Heart Mother and Obscured By Clouds??? <BR>  I don`t agree that the title album song, ECHOES, was cutted in SEVEN minutes, that`s very bad!!!!!<BR>  But the real thing that we need is another LIVE RECORDING!!! as Is There Anybody Out There?. I`ve got some bootlegs with old stuff from Atom Heart Mother to Momenatary Lapse Of Reason tours and they are really cool. <BR>  Please EMI and Pink Floyd, edit some old live recordings for the fans, we need it!!!!!
078401213X|4.0|Darren Aronofsky's brilliant debut is this black and white indie picture.  It stars Sean Guilette as a hermitted mathematical wizard who believes that numbers hold the pattern to everything.  The pattern that continues to illude him is the patter of Pi.  He soon finds that there is a pattern to it though, a 216 digit number.  In figuring this out Guilette gains more than he bargained for.  Two groups of people are also after this number:  A set of Jewish extremists and a set of vicious Wall Street brokers.  Then the race is on to see who can control the pattern of Pi.  Aronofsky's cinematography is remarkable, the angles and character development are also very in depth.  Now see the debut that earned him top honors at Sundance.
B00005LB50|5.0|I have been waiting over 30 years for this, and it's fabulous, a must for anyone who loves CSNY, Poco and of course Neil. My only critical observation is that they included some songs twice...sounds like same versions.....On The Way Home alternate sounds as close as you can get to hearing them live.....Hollywood Palace shows with intro by Tony Martin left out here.....But it's really fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a must for younger fans to find some of the roots in the rock and country sounds of today

0441172717|5.0|Dune.  The original.  Much has been said about it, most good and deservedly so.  Some have called it the best Science Fiction book of all time.  I'm inclined to agree.  Herbert has actually created a world with different cultures and religions and ways of life.  The characters are well drawn, if a little cold.  But that's the way of the world in which they live.  In which Houses come before love and people seldom matter, except to a few.  However, as usual, the good guys are easily identified, as are the bad.  <br />The world of Dune has a life of it's on, one that seems seperate from the rest of the known universe.  The Fremen are one of the most remarkable culture of people ever put to page and one of the most fascinating.  You are drawn into Paul's story and his destiny, of which these desert dwellers are a part.  The other characters are great as well.  Just can't get enough of Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck.  And Duke Leto is about a noble a character as you can get. <br />I was introduced to Dune by the mini series and the prequel novels by Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert, all of which were vastly entertaining, but this book is easily levels above those works.<br />I really don't have a lot to add to what has already been said, but to encourage you to believe the legend.  Dune is THAT good.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I dont own this album and wouldnt be sucker enough to buy it. Based off the sound of the one single i have heard, I cant even remember the name of it, its so forgettable, the strokes are pure NYC retro garbage. it ust goes to show you the age of most music critics when this record showed up on like every top 10 list for album of the year. If you want to hear this type of music, buy a stooges record or the velvet underground, two truly great bands. The strokes unfortunately are about 30 years behind the times. The strokes are truly the great rock n roll swindle.
0679809015|5.0|I bought this book for my eight-month old daughter.  It is her absolute favorite book.  The size is small enough that she can turn it over and over in her hands, open the pages and the flaps.  We read it to her several times a day.  I would recommend this for any parent with small children!
B00004X01U|3.0|(I may sound a little bit critical to the worlds most famous star, but she doesnt write her own songs..)<BR>Madonnas music CD are good but the famous songs were I a little bit tired on when I bought this CD, but i realized that first when I came home... The other songs are a little bit bad written but they are fun to listen to! Ok, lets start with track one:<BR>1.Music - Ok, I have heard it so many times on the radio, but IT IS good...<BR>2.Impressive instant - I like this song kind of much, its a little much of electric instruments in it and sometimes Madonna gets a electric voice...<BR>3.Runaway lover - I REALLY like this song!!!<BR>4.I deserve it - A really good slow song<BR>5.Amazing - Is really AMAZING!!<BR>6.Nobodys perfect - The beginning is really bad but the rest of the song is soft and very good(one of my favorites)<BR>7.Dont tell me - NOOOO, I dont even think I have listened to it since ive bought this CD, because ive heard it so many times!<BR>8.What it feels like for a girl - One of my favorites again!!!<BR>9.Paradise (not for me) - No, no, no This song is not for me, I really dont like the beginning!!<BR>10.Gone - A very, very good song, no data voices or anything! <BR>11.American pie - I dont want to be so negative so this song, (as I hope youve heard)you must judge yourself<BR>(But I think it is ok, but the first version was better)<BR>OK, thats it! <BR>You have to buy the CD if you are a huge Madonna fan, but im not, so you would might love it!!
6305165912|5.0|My personal favorite of the Coens' increasingly brilliant body of work, The Big Lebowski is the story of Jeff Lebowski, The Dude (Jeff Bridges), and the disruption of his pleasantly mundane life by a couple of thugs who pee on his rug, punch him in the face, and demand money.  They've mistaken him for another man of the same name (the Big Lebowski), and, as one might imagine, things go downhill from there.  The film has a terrific cast, including John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and even Tara Reid as the Big Lebowski's pricelessly slutty wife.  Add to that a couple of musical numbers worthy of thirties Broadway adaptation, and you have one of the funniest, most original movies in recent memory.  And yes, that really is Kenny Rogers singing &quot;Just Dropped In.&quot;
0385505833|4.0|This is a cute story, and well written, as are all of Grisham's works.  If you're looking for something short and sweet, particularly around the holiday season, it does the trick.  I found the plot a little farfetched at times, though, and do wish that I'd gotten it from the library rather than as a free literary group selection.  I was anxious to read, but now feel like I wasted my choice, and should have gotten a more substantial and thought-provoking book.
B000002KN8|4.0|I recently bought this CD for a little trip down memory lane (I had it on vinyl back in the 80s). It's a fun bit of history, though some of the songs are almost unlistenable nowadays because they are so incredibly cheesy and low-tech techno.<br />Some of the songs still strike me as very good, minimalist techno -- for instance, &quot;Nodisco,&quot; &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and &quot;Puppets.&quot; But other, more fluffy-pop songs, like &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; and &quot;What's Your Name?&quot; are almost embarrassing to listen to now (even by myself!).<br />Still, it's a unique recording, and it's interesting to see how much DM has changed over the years. You just might find yourself skipping past some of the songs (much easier on CD than vinyl, thankfully).
0380817683|5.0|What a wonderful book! I had been wanting to read this book for some time, since it had been recommended by so many people in one of my book groups. I read \\"Watermelon\\" by Keyes 3 years ago, and found it a little too light for my taste, but was simply blown away by this book. I could easily see it being made into a movie. If you want the story to be a total surprise, and would rather not hear anything about it ahead of time, then stop reading right here, or just skip the next paragraph - I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone.<br />The book relays the experiences of Rachel, the younger sister of Claire's that was barely mentioned in \\"Watermelon\\". I found the book to be stunningly insightful, not just about addiction, but rather so many basic topics surrounding self-esteem. I really feel that this book has a little something for everyone - that might just be my awed opinion, but if you didn't care so much for Watermelon, don't let it discourage you from reading this book. <br />I was thinking that everything I had heard about \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" must be hype, and that I would be disappointed, but I definitely was not. I was actually very impressed with the author's research into this subject matter, and the great readability of the book. Don't miss this one!
B00005JKQX|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; directed by Ron Howard, is a biographical film based on the life of eminent mathematician John Nash. As the film begins, we meet Nash (played by Russell Crowe) as a brilliant, but eccentric and somewhat anti-social, college student. He eventually attains a plum position at a prestigious institution and falls in love with a beautiful young woman (the luminous Jennifer Connelly). But after a series of encounters with a Department of Defense agent (a menacing, intense Ed Harris), Nash's life begins to spin horribly out of control. Ultimately, he faces a long struggle that forces him to walk a line between genius and insanity.<br />If you aren't familiar with the real-life story of Nash, you will be in for some shocking plot twists and revelations which I will not spoil. Overall, &quot;Mind&quot; is a superb biopic which achieves a true epic sweep. It is a moving, suspenseful, often harrowing, and ultimately inspiring film. Crowe is in nearly every scene of the film; his portrayal of Nash over a long time span is truly remarkable. He captures both the transcendent genius and the vulnerable humanity of this amazing individual.<br />Crowe's performance is well complemented by a fine supporting cast. If you were impressed by Connelly's daring, painful perfomance in Darren Aronofsky's shocking &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; you will find her in equally strong form here. Harris is solid as usual, and I really enjoyed Paul Bettany's performance as a school chum. The story is well complemented by strong production values, a fine musical score, and some subtle but effective visual effects. Overall, I highly recommend &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;; it's one of the year's best films.
0553213105|5.0|If you enjoy British 19th century literature, you are sure to like this book.  I read it for a book group selection, and am so glad I was able to get a copy of it.  The dialogue is so wonderfully witty, and full of meanings that are not immediately discernable to American readers that are less familiar with this more formal manner of speaking, as I was.  I still enjoyed it, as the story is a romantic comedy that I feel has a little something for anyone that enjoys a good romance.  It is definitely more subtle than the kinds of things one reads these days, but that seems to be a good thing.  The BBC televised version with Colin Firth is also very good.
B00005OWEG|2.0|I'm one of the few Vietnam vets who actually liked Apocalypse Now.  Most vets hate this movie because it isn't realistic.  Those vets who hated the original are REALLY going to hate this version - and those of us who liked the original are going to be disappointed.  The added scenes increase the unreality of the movie without enhancing it's deeper qualities.  For example, when Willard steals Kilgore's surfboard and Kilgore then pursues Willard with a psy-ops chopper, asking for the board back, I found myself shaking my head.  Coppola has chosen to try and make war appear insane by having his people be insane - and those of us who were there are bound to resent that.  Worse, it distorts what was a valiant, but failed attempt to show what war is really like.  Some of the added scenes might have been enhancing, but to use them effectively Coppola should have trimmed some of the more offensive (to vets) scenes.  For example, in the original we see the villagers living a nice peaceful life right before Kilgore's battalion attacks.  In the background, we see the North Vietnamese flag flying in the square.  The impression is the NVA and VC were helping the peasants have a wonderful life until those nasty Americans screwed it up.  Clip that out, and put in the French plantation stuff. Using Heart of Darkness to portray the human impact of war was brilliant, even if the attempt failed in the original.  It really fails in the revised version. The nice thing about the &quot;Redux&quot; DVD is that the added scenes are listed, so you know which ones to skip to get the original back.
B000002LCU|5.0|This CD is surely George Harrison's best work in the decade prior to the Traveling Wilburys.<br />    &quot;That's What it Takes&quot; is mystical and inspiring.  &quot;Fish on the Sand&quot; is a catchy love song.  &quot;Just for Today&quot; is a slow, melancholy song.  It is about trying to overcome depression and the hardships of life.  &quot;This is Love&quot; is an upbeat song with a fast tempo.  &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; is the best known song from side one.  It is an excellent look back at Beatle days.  Appropriately, Ringo plays on the song and appears in the video.<br />    &quot;Devil's Radio&quot;  is a fast and catchy song which is primarily social commentary.  &quot;Someplace Else&quot; is a slow, sad song about trying to escape the sad things of life.  &quot;Breath Away from Heaven&quot; is a haunting song about a mystery woman.  The lyrics describe her effect.  &quot;Got My Mind set on You&quot; is of course a great remake.  It led to, perhaps, Harrison's best known video.<br />    In the &quot;Special Thanks&quot; section of the CD Harrison pays tribute to John, Paul and Ringo.  He also thanks Olivia and Dhani.
B00003CXXS|3.0|I waited in anticipation for this film, and was disappointed! I agree with what others have said here, I miss Steven Spielberg as director. I loved seeing Sam Neill again, but what happened between him and Lorna Doone? That's never explained, like so much of the film. Is Billy his son or are they just close? And yes, Tea should have been eaten, the way she runs screaming through the film!<br />The behind-the-scenes is probably more interesting than the film itself.<br />Still, it's worth one watch, just so you know you didn't miss anything!<br />I preferred the Widescreen version, even though I have a square TV, that way you don't miss any edges of the scenes.<br />This was a shockingly short film, with no thrills and fewer dinosaurs.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I would of gave this 3.5 stars but [Amazon.com] don't do halfs. This is a good and different album that I have. At first it took me a long time to get into it and when I had heard it about 4 times I started to like it more. Nice To Know You is a future hit as that standed out to me with a mellow verse going into a stronger chorus. Circles isn't one of my favourites as I had downloaded the song before I purchased the album and didn't think it was anything special. Wish You were here - Everyone loves that song and have heard it so much, I never get tired of it because it is so brilliant. It was at number 1 in the most wanted chart on mtv2 for about 1 month!<BR>Just A Phase is a weird song as the singer does'nt say anything for about 2 minutes, When he does though it starts to get quite good and the chorus is different. 11am may be another future hit too, gets started quickly with some good lyrics. Can't be arsed to get the album down to see the other tracks! but I will say \\"Warning\\" is probably one of the best songs, a definate future release. Number 13 is 7 minutes long!
B00004STPT|5.0|I would have to say that this soundtrack is the best I have ever came across. It holds your attention throughout the whole CD. After listening to it you'll find yourself humming the tracks throughout the day. When I listen to it I find myself repeating track 3 \\"The Battle\\" over and over again because it's so gripping.  This soundtrack is perfect weather you're doing the dishes, homework, working, or whenever you feel in the mood for a great score!<BR>        <br />      I also reccommend the soundtrack to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"
B00005R87Q|5.0|This film is my favourite film of all times it really appeals to young people actually perhaps under 25, well i'm 16. i mean theres loads of cars with the engine over exaggerated, i didnt actually think about that at the time at the time i just thought wow does this really happen in life ( i know i sounded niave but hey who cares).  Its so unpredictable whats gonna happen next which is very original and inventive, but i guess the title kind of gives it away anyway.<BR>After watching this film its not only a guys film but also a girls film too with all the fit guys in it such as Paul Walker.<BR>He's gorgeous,a typical and a perfect surfer, with a brilliant body. <BR>Which this film is definately worth watching which ever sex you are.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best I have come across.  It captures your attention with every song whether it's just delightful and fun like track 2,&quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; or heroic and exciting like track 13, &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot;.  After you listen to this CD you'll catch yourself humming the tunes throughout the entire day.  This soundtrack is perfect for listening to while your doing dishes, working, doing homework, or just whenever you feel in the mood.  Take my word on this: If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!<br />     I also reccomend the soundtrack to Gladiator.
B00005QW5X|2.0|John Cameron Mitchell's stage show was infinitely better than this poorly directed version. It's self-aggrandizement to the nth degree. What do all the meaningful looks actually mean when one character sings to another? What is Andrea Martin as the Agent doing in the movie? Her character's actions make no sense. Why should we care about Hedwig? At least with the stage show you have the raw excitiment of live theatre, and you develop a rapport with Hedwig; however, here, it feels as though Mitchell just wanted to toot his own egohorn. It's just plain bad storytelling.
0856610798|5.0|This book really sets a very high standard and we can only hope other parts of the world's tropics will get similar guides in due time. The plates are just about as superb as one could possibly wish for. When you compare this book with the new field guides that have recently come out for South America, it seems like there are two worlds! Just compare the flamingos, the osprey, or the parrots with the pictures you find in &quot;The Field Guide to the Birds of Peru&quot; and you know what I mean! There is also an excellent lay-out, with helpful concise text and useful range maps all neatly placed together. And the book is still amazingly compact.
6303022901|5.0|Even though I'm not Asian, I'm a pastor and I worship with and minister to Asians here in Chicago (mostly college students and young adults).After seeing this movie, I can really understand the struggles Asians go through, especially young ladies. This movie has really broadened my horizons and has been helpful to my ministry. I think every Asian-American parent as well as their kids should see this picture. Tamlyn Tamito, Rosalind Chao, and the rest of the cast should be proud. They've done an excellent job of rpresenting Asian culture and the struggles that go with it. God bless all of the cast and crew!
B00005JKT8|5.0|Just like the Hepburn and Tracy romance comedys of yesteryear, Kate and Leopold hit the mark with just enough humor, tenderness and fantasy.  I absolutely adored it!!! I'm going again and will definitely add the DVD to my library when it's released.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|When I heard that Howard Shore was scoring &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I immediatly became apprehensive.  The only Shore score I owned then was &quot;The Cell&quot;- and after giving it another listen, I became quite frightened.  Was the LOTR soundtrack going to be full of brash, chaotic middle-eastern and celtic instruments playing melody-less masses of notes?  Don't get me wrong- I thought that &quot;The Cell&quot; score was quite good, but that style just wouldn't work with LOTR.  I hurried and ordered the soundtrack on amazon.  On Nov. 19, the score arrived at my door.  I listened, and all doubts subsided.  The score is beautiful, flowing, and most of all, intelligent.  It would have been easy for Shore to create a soundtrack that was pleasant, but insipidly cliche.  I was waiting for a Horner rip-off, but upon hearing the score, I felt quite ashamed for doubting.  This score does things musically that (at least!) I didn't expect.  There are a few harmony changes during which I sped the track backwards, saying to myself &quot;really?  Did he just do what I thought?!?&quot;  The &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; track is one of my favorites- it moves from a small, quaint theme played by only a few instruments, to large, sweeping orchestral themes, and then back again as easy as it came.  Beautiful!  This is a must-own!
B00005R87Q|5.0|If you like real cars going real fast, you have gotta see this.  It is filled with fast action scenes, beautiful women, and is accompanied by a surprisingly good plot.  I'm a car fanatic, but even if I wasn't , I would give it a 11 out of 10 just because of the special effects and action sequences.
B000002VMH|5.0|When in the world is she going to put out another cd?  This is almost 10 years old and I still listen to it regularly.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Let me start out by saying this: I know a lot of the ideas in this soundtrack have been used before, and I know it is pretty cue-specific.  However, let me also say that after coming out of the theater on December 19 from my first viewing of Fellowship of the Ring, Howard Shore's excellent score was what stuck with me the most.<br />So what does this CD have to offer?  Many memorable songs, for one, including several very inspired choral sections that, IMHO, put even Duel of the Fates to shame.  Most notable of these would be the chanting in Bridge of Khazad-Dum (in fact, my biggest complaint with the entire soundtrack is that the chanting is toned down to background noise in the soundtrack, where in the movie it was the main focus of the song), as well as the well-used boy's choir in In Dreams (part of the Breaking of the Fellowship).  In fact, it is hard to find a single track on the CD where the human voice is not put to good use, which brings me to Enya's contribution.  To my knowledge, her beatiful voice can be heard in the Council of Elrond theme, singing (in elvish!) the theme of Aragorn and Arwen.  More notable, however, is May it Be, the obligatory vocal track during the credits.  The lyrics, composition, and performance of this song are all spot-on, and I wouldn't be surprised if it takes an Oscar this year.<br />There are also a few notable themes in the soundtrack that do are purely instumental, however.  Concerning Hobbits is an extremely strong theme, and is developed well in that track and echoed throughout the rest of the soundtrack.  The main theme of the movie, although a bit cliched, conveys a sense of heroism qnd is used to good effect everywhere from Elrond proclaiming the formation of the Fellowship to the Fellowship fleeing from a horde of orcs in Moria.<br />Although it is true that the music is cue-specific at times, the majority of the songs stand on their on very well.  Although it might confuse someone who has not yet seen the movie, I personally can't speak to that viewpoint as I purposely held of listening to the soundtrack until after I saw the movie.<br />Overall, despite the use of a few cliches, Howard Shore and Enya have both done some very nice work here, giving us a memorable score to a memorable movie.  I think anyone will enjoy it, and here's to hoping Shore does the next one as well!
B00000BKDS|5.0|This album is not much like Maiden's other stuff, aside from maybe &quot;Killers&quot;. Beware kids, this is RAW!! I don't know why Maiden dumped Clive Burr after &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot;. I think he's better than Nicko. It's weird, I don't remember ever hearing of him playing in any other band after Maiden. Maybe he just became a cab driver lol! Alright, now onto the album. Dennis Stratton has a different lead syle than Adrian Smith. Paul Dianno is great, but he's not Dickinson. Can you imagine if Maiden continued on w/ Dianno? Would be interesting, but at least half of the listeners would not like them as much as they do. Best songs are &quot;Prowler&quot; (2nd best song ever), &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Running Free&quot;. Recommended.
B00004U8P9|5.0|A wonderful craetion, a movie to be admired with a massage that is still relevant til this very day. Watch it in a group and follow the orders of &quot;cround participation&quot;.
0553106635|5.0|I was a bit disappointed with Martin's _A Clash of Kings_, which I found to be inferior to his incredible _A Game of Thrones_. _Storm of Swords_, though, is a masterpiece. <br />Be prepared to feel hate, love, fear, pity, guilt, despair, and a myriad of other emotions towards these characters. Yes, you'll care about them. And be prepared to gasp in surprise when the unexpected suddenly hits the page you're on. Martin can do that with the turn of a phrase, having earlier slipped in unnociteable setups behind your back. _A Storm of Swords_ is that kind of book.<br />It's not without its faults. Some of the POVs are dangerously dull in the first 450 pages of the book, and Martin's strataegy of ending almost every single chapter from a certain point of the book on with a huge cliffhanger can be exiting but also frustrating at the same time, since it could be 300 pages or so before you actually reach the same POV again.<br />But those are small faults. _A Storm of Swords_ is just too good to be true.
B000021XS0|5.0|I have nothing to say. This is just TOO excellent.<BR>I only have a couple of albums that I can SERIOUSLY rate 5 stars...and this one is definitely one of them!
0380796090|5.0|Smart, funny, motivational, highly entertaining - if I could give this book more than five stars, I would.  It is really that good.  Basic plot summary - James tells Claire the day she gives birth to their daughter that he's leaving her for another woman.  Naturally Claire is devastated and goes home to Ireland to recoup. The journey (and I'm not talking the physical travel) she takes, from London to Ireland, and back, is a wonderful tale.  Any woman who's ever dealt with men will relate to this tale.  Claire is someone I'd like to know in real life.  Do yourself a favor and get this book.
0380973650|5.0|American Gods is the rarest of creatures: a literate, witty, mordant, and moving contemporary fantasy novel. Yes, its pace is studied rather than frantic, its tone cool and thoughtful rather than histrionic, but the patient reader will be amply rewarded by Gaiman's carefully plotted and beautifully written tale of Old World dieties struggling for survival and relevance in 21st century America.<br />Gaiman has taken the essence of his gemlike short stories and blown it up into a genuine epic. Much more so than the entertaining but somewhat sparse Neverwhere, American Gods uses the novel's length and format to build power, even as its structure allows Gaiman to deploy a handful of strking short tales within it.<br />Anyone who has enjoyed Gaiman's previous work, or the contemporary fantasy of Clive Barker, Tim Powers, Roger Zelazny, or Kim Newman, is likely to enjoy this excellent book.
6305657947|5.0|Pierce Brosan and Rene Russo team up in this Oscar Caliber performance about a man who takes his life to the edge and loves to take risks. His objective: Infiltrate a high-security art museum in broad daylight, steal a prestigious painting, and get out without any suspicion from the authorities. Rene Russo investigates Crown and finds out that he is more than what she first believed him to be. The Thomas Crown Affair is a romantic, sexy, suspenseful, sleek, and intelligent movie that will leave one in awe. As far as DVD feautures go, I give it my highest ranking. This DVD is interactive, and loaded with special features that add to the excitement. Definetly consider adding this DVD to your collection today. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Alternately dubbed rock messiahs and lightweight throwbacks in the hype-saturated months surrounding their debut release, The Strokes respond with a stirring serving of urban grit that straddles the chasm separating resignation from exuberance in mainstream music.  Is This It repels the label of derivative product by introducing elements of vulnerability and catharsis within the three-minute pop song structure that the band's most heavily cited influence, The Velvet Underground, seldom captured in their seminal releases.  Singer and songwriter Julian Casablancas' vocals bear the indelible mark of Lou Reed in the album's disaffected title track and The Modern Age, but the 22-year-old's cocksure charisma manifests itself in guttural explosions to create a style that ultimately conveys ennui and despair in an original manner.  <br />The majority of songs on Is This It document relationships in various stages of disrepair.  Casablancas sees himself as the irreverent catalyst for breakdown in the bounce of Someday (&quot;You say you wanna stay by my side/Darlin', your head's not right&quot;) and its upbeat counterpart, Last Nite (&quot;'Oh baby, gonna be alright'/It was a great big lie/'Cause I left that night&quot;).  Trying Your Luck finds the vocalist trading roles as he pursues a perpetually inaccessible partner.  In his dejected contemplation, Casablancas declares &quot;The signals don't seem right/They last for just one night, and then/I'm sorry that I said/That we were just good friends.&quot;  Guitarist Nick Valensi punctuates the intensity with a stinging solo that weaves through the song without disrupting the cresting momentum.  <br />Decadence bubbles to the surface in the form of insidious drug experimentation (&quot;Tried it once and they like it/Then tried to hide it/Says, 'I've been doing this 25 years'&quot; from Soma) and sordid, sexual encounters (&quot;Lisa says,'Take time for me'/Dropping him down to his knees&quot; from Alone, Together).  The disillusionment evident in &quot;'You drink too much'/Makes me drink just the same&quot; exemplifies the tone of brutal honesty that is nevertheless alarming for its portentousness.  <br />Is This It's sole fault results from the removal of New York City Cops in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The substitution, When It Started, is noticeably inferior to the predescessor.  Cavilling with the strongest release of 2001 is an exercise in futility; allow The Strokes to assault your senses with equal portions of style and substance.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Sure, there's a lot of hype behind this band, but it's for a good reason. This is one of the most talented gothic/hardcore-rock bands out there. It's one of those bands that the preps and posers can never have, so they bash it. That doesn't make it bad, they'd just rather listen to N Sync or something like that I guess. Anybody like that has no business writing a review anyway. (This may sound like a rant rather than a review for Slipknot, but it's part of the band's image, so whatever, eh?) Anyway, if your're into hardcore stuff, this is for you.
079213690X|5.0|That's one way of looking at &quot;Braveheart&quot;, with Mel Gibson playing the Scottish national hero, William Wallace. Like Spartacus, Wallace was also a real-life person. Like Spartacus, he strove against a mighty oppressor nation that was destroying the liberty of others. And like Spartacus, Wallace died for his cause in a brutal fashion.<br />I saw &quot;Braveheart&quot; after I returned from a moving trip to Scotland, where I learned of the brave hero from countrymen who still love and revere him, centuries after his struggles for their liberty. I heard in advance from them where there are inaccuracies in the story (the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge, for instance, not a plain), but still and all, I found it a moving depiction of man's fight against injustice. Mel Gibson turned in a great performance of Wallace, and Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward of England was wickedly good as well.<br />If you're found of Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, then you'll be very happy with Mel Gibson's epic, too.
B00005R87Q|3.0|This movie was obviously made by people who truly do not know the import scene.  Yes i know the director asked some people in the import scene to give his insight, but he obviously didn't do alot of it.  First off, how come all the main cars in the movie are all painted.  The real import scene does not do that, they keep it clean.  And now CRX or 88-91 Civics?  That's a joke.  <br />If you just want to see some fast cars and good action, this movie is pretty good.  But if you want to get an accurate interpretation of the import scene, you are in for a bad surprise.
0786867973|5.0|At first I thought Lawson was referring to some 50s TV housewife with her title, and I was happily proven wrong on the very first page. This book is a delight from word go, and the recipes I've tried so far--a rhubarb cordial and a batch of cupcakes--have been excellent. Lawson's writing shows plenty of wit and intelligence, but there's a warm sense of causualness in the pre-recipe notes that makes me feel I'm jotting down kitchen tips from a hip friend. While simplifying the art of baking tremendously, she also manages to infest a baker (or wannabe) with a terrific sense of accomplishment and pleasure. Not only do I plan on eventually trying every recipe in the book (they all sound so good!), but I have every intention of buying a copy for every baker I know.
B000002NIW|5.0|It is a sweet sound to hear.  The screams of lead man Chino.  The stuff is intense but melodic in it's ways.<br />Starting with an underground success like Adrenline, their sophmore venture needed a bit more.  Calming down the intensity a little helped get their music on underground and college radio.  After they released this CD, they really set out to make a name for themselves.  Touring relentlessly, performing everywhere they had to be, and securing themselves another CD (White Pony) helped build the foundation of a band that will be talked about for sometime.<br />The songs on the CD are excellently matched.  Everything flows together so well that it is like a never ending song.  My only problem with the CD is that the hidden track &quot;Damone&quot; is 32 minutes after &quot;MX&quot; (pronounced 'Max').  It is a great song, but you have to sit there fast forwarding through the silence and a small little segment that I have no idea what is said.  Besides the small little flaw, it is a historical CD.<br />Bass, drums, and guitars are played perfectly and you are able to hear each one perfectly.  The screams of Chino are well timed and his voice is incredible.<br />The only thing better than this album is hearing some of these songs live.  I found a website a while back that had a live concert before the White Pony CD came out and it was amazing.  Look around for live stuff and also check out a demo or two of the Deftones before they were big.<br />Mostly, this CD is amazing in it's presentation, the lack of airplay, and the raw energy that the Deftones give off.  Listen to this over and over again.
B00004XONN|5.0|It is difficult for most people to choose their favorite Radiohead album. If you were to ask me, chances are I would say &quot;Kid A&quot;. There are so many reasons why. Basically, all of the music on the album is incredible and the sequence of tracks somehow creates a flowing, coherent journey of sound. Sure, the music varies over the course of Kid A but it all comes together. This is in sharp contrast to the seemingly piecemeal compilation of Amnesiac (Kid A's twin brother released in 2001).<br />Right off the bat, track 1, &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;, gives you an immediate indication that Kid A is not another OK Computer (1997) and is in an entirely different galaxy from The Bends (1995). This impression is reinforced on the next track, &quot;Kid A&quot;. Here you find computer-processed Thom Yorke lyrics among strange synthesized effects. At this point it's hard to decide if the album is too weird to be good or too intriguing to be bad. But then you jump into &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, a guitar-driven song that concludes with blaring trumpets. Yet still it's given time to cool down and pretty much faid into the significantly downtempo &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot;. This type of volume rollercoaster goes on through the end. Yet Radiohead masterfully harnesses the coherence that defines Kid A as the masterpiece it truly is. This probably explains why no singles were released off of Kid A. The whole is less without its parts and vice versa. Even &quot;Treefingers&quot;, a very slow, meandering track would be seen as boring and pointless on almost any other album. But here it has its place.<br />To me, the music on Kid A feels distant and impersonal. It's almost as if you're looking from the inside out at the music and it's on the other side. In fact, Thom Yorke once described the &quot;theme&quot; of Kid A as being something like that and it was captured perfectly. Kid A soothes and intrigues me. Listening to it is like taking a voyage to a far away place for 45 minutes. This is most definitely one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. Undoubtedly 5 stars.
B00005B602|5.0|I have not seen this movie, but listened to samples of this CD in a record store.  I couldn't wait to get home and listen to it over and over!  The music tells a story of it's own, with a distinct &quot;French&quot; sound.  Yann Tiersen is remarkable, and has a talent for making magical music that will transform you to a different place. This music is a must if you've seen the movie, but again, I highly recommend it even if you haven't!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Should viewers have seen this production in the movie theatre, I strongly urge you to own a piece of this DVD which provided you with so much insight about behind the scene actions, the creative process, the production process, the background research that brought Moulin Rouge onto the silver screen.  I found the whole experience highly enjoyable (watching both the documentary &amp; the movie itself) &amp; got to learn more about Baz, the whimsical Director who was able to connect with his audience by introducing contemporary pop culture into a story that was set back a century ago.  Baz shared one similar sentiment with Peter Jackson, the New Zealand director who brought us Lord of the Rings, that the essence of going to watch their movies was to allow viewers to escape from the real world just momentarily &amp; thus, the movies were never meant to be taken seriously but as feast to the eyes.  Moulin Rouge exceeded my expectation &amp; I'm too certain that you wouldn't be disappointed.  All the extra features in the DVD are highlights in their own rites
0375431624|2.0|Grisham's vacation from writing legal whodunits is costing him his fine reputation, at least with me.  He's been one of my favorite authors ever since I read his first book years ago, but he won't be long at the rate he's going. I'm hoping for better fare soon. &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; was predictable, unimaginative, colorless and, while short, was too long. One of the first rules of writing is to write what you know about; apparently Grisham knows precious little about skipping Christmas, daughters who go away, and the reaction of neighbors. I wondered what he was doing, except trying something a bit different, when he wrote &quot;A Painted House,&quot; but it turned out to be interesting at least when listened to on cassette. It was a diversion for sure, but interesting and somewhat realistic. But &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;?  No, Mr. Grisham, it is in no way up to your usual standards or mine. Writing the umpteenth book about legal eagles probably is more than a bit challenging but you can do it.  I'm waiting for my copy of &quot;The Summons&quot; with great anticipation.
0385505833|1.0|This book was boring and a waste of time.  I only finished it because it was so short.  The majority of the book deals with a family and their days before Christmas - nothing unusual or exciting.  The ending was a little better than the majority of the book.  If you must read because it is by Grisham, do not waste your money and get if from the library.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was one of my favorites.  I loved all the characters, the two lead male characters were amazing!  I also liked the two lead female characters a lot!  This will continue to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00005BJC7|4.0|What can I say good about Radiohead that hasn't already been said? Not too much. It seems everyone loves these guys. Or at least I havent met anyone who dislikes them. It would be difficult to formulate an argument for the latter. I don't know of any other band making music right now that has released four successive albums of material that is about as close to flawless as music gets. Radiohead is on the forefront of the musical landscape as we know it. Maybe not of all music, but certainly Alternative Rock at the very least. <br />The rules of your typical 5-piece band do not apply here. Computers and a piano have just as much influence on Radiohead's music as the guitar, bass, and drum. In fact, two songs off Amnesiac feature a complete orchestra. Styles range from the thumping beats and processed lyrics of &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot; to the beautiful simplicity of Thom Yorke and his piano on &quot;You And Whose Army?&quot;. Oh yeah, and those two songs are back-to-back on the album. This fact and other similar occurences over the course of the album have caused a bit of a debate. Some claim Amnesiac sounds more like a piecemeal collection of songs rather than a cohesive track listing. I would tend to agree with this, especially when you compare it against its earlier released twin brother, Kid A, which is possibly the most masterfully arranged album I've ever listened to. <br />I feel a number of the B-sides from Amnesiac's singles would have filled in quite nicely in place of some tracks I feel didn't deserve to make the cut. If you haven't had the privilege of hearing the Amnesiac B-sides, I reccomend you buy the singles or download them from your favorite music-sharing client. Some of the weaker Amnesiac tracks as I see it are &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot;, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot;, and &quot;Pull\Pulk Revolving Doors&quot;.<br />However, there are so many moments of brilliance that far surpass any disappointing track. &quot;Packt Like SardinesIn A Crushd Tin Box&quot; is certainly one of the more upbeat releases from Radiohead's later work. It gives you the indication immediately that Amnesiac isn't the same spacey, distant album that Kid A was. It's more accessible and more personal. &quot;Packt...&quot; moves right on to &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;. What an amazing song. At one point Thom's voice and the orchestra playing in the background come to a chilling crescendo that still blows me away after having owned Amnesiac for several months. Other standouts include &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot;, &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;, &quot;You And Whose Army?&quot;, and &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;.<br />The fact that 3 out of 11 songs seem subpar to me and the peculiar track listing are the two simple reasons for me giving Amnesiac 4 stars rather than 5.<br />With such a refreshing variation of sounds and instrumentation, Radiohead almost always manages to get it right. The fact that after 1997's world-acclaimed OK Computer Radiohead produced enough good material for a 5-star album (Kid A) and a 4-star album (Amnesiac) just attests to their brilliance. Furthermore, Radiohead's ability to generate such avant garde music and still enjoy mainstream success confirms their place as a pioneer of modern music.
B00000AOUD|5.0|There is no finer album of the rock era. This recording has more episodes, idiosyncracies and nuances than Rabelais' &quot;Gargantua &amp; Pantagruel&quot;. Hummable ditties plucked out on the Martin guitar, heavy freak outs, and turns of phrase that keep you chuckling and happy. Don't be daunted by the 45 minute song...one's attention and amusement are maintained by constant shifts in melody, lyric, and instrumentation. I've been listening to this album more consistently than any other for the past 20 years. It saddens me that popular music no longer hangs its hat on such originality (and Tull was nowhere near good-looking enough to make a buck in todays MTV/VH1 world), but I'm grateful that one can hang onto artifacts such as this to be reminded of the spirit of creativity and individuality of eras gone by. Stand aside, pretty boy...I'm carrying this beauty straight into the Promised Land.<br />One can only hope that when Chrysalis gets to the &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; reissue (they've just re-released versions of the first 3 Tull albums) that the remastering brings this recording into the 21st century (and hopefully includes outtakes from the era, such as &quot;Wondering Again&quot;, etc).
B00004STOQ|4.0|This album is the best of her career. In terms of material and performance. Bright and original. A testament to Ms Turner's talent as a performer.
B000002WAD|5.0|I used to have this tape SO long ago- when I was still playing with Barbies! I had, somewhere in the years, misplaced it and was SO happy to find that Amazon.com had it. I LOVE this guy. His songs are amazing. Upbeat. Great Great Great songs, that you never tire of. My husband made fun of me for buying this since the cd itself was so many years old, but I think he actually enjoys some of the songs when I force him to listen to it! HA
B000002GK1|5.0|of &quot;Seattle grunge&quot;, that punk-metal phenomenon of the early nineties, Badmotorfinger displays all the aggression and angst of that movement, and deserves a place among the greatest albums ever recorded. Deep and brooding lyrics, heavy mesmerizing riffs, and the patented &quot;Cornell wail&quot; are all on display here. Of course &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot;, and &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers&quot; are standout cuts, my own personal favorites are &quot;Holy Water&quot; with its spiritual theme and &quot;New Damage&quot; with its slow melody and incredible vocal performance.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is an incredible album.  TOOL consists of truly amazing architects of music.  Every song is constructed in a unique, non-traditional manner and taps into multiple levels of emotions.  It is impossible not to feel inspired and grateful that their compositions exist.  They are on another level completely.
0471413909|4.0|Dr. Cordain has written an excellent book for the general public.  I would have like to see the book cover more of the technical aspects of Cordain's work as there is considerable &quot;data&quot; supporting this diet.  <br />This book makes an important distinction between high protein diets vs. high fat diets.  Atkins, Protein Power, and Zone can all be paleolithic diets but in practice are probably not.  The protein intakes are too low in most cases.  They may be too low on Atkins as he recomends fatty meat.  Protein Power recommends minimum intakes that would be too low and if someone has free choice of fat intake like on Protein Power that may feel full on lower protein intakes.  The Zone would provide sufficient protein if someone were to ignore its 1200-1500 calorie recommendations.  The zone usually becomes a high fat diet as protien and carb intakes stay the same if you follow Sears recommendation to use fat as a caloric balast when you don't wish to lose more weight.  <br />In response to the question of protein intakes  by another reviewer here.  The 55% represents aminal intake, not protein amount.  However, protein intake on Cordain's diet is up to 35% of total calorie intake.  <br />Cordain's diet is not a starvation diet like the Zone and the carb intake is much higher than most low carb recommendations This should prevent ongoing ketosis and potassium losses so commonly found on Protein Power and Atkins.

B00005QZWJ|5.0|The songs in this sound track convey what you are feeling when you see the movie perfectly. You almost woudln't have to see the movie to know exactly what is going on in every song. The songs are loaded with feeling and they transport you right to Middle Earth. These songs convey every aspect of the story. You can picture the beautiful scenery of New Zealand (where the movie was filmed), you get to know the elves, dwarves, hobbits, and Gandalf, and you feel the immense evil of Sauron. This is the type of music that you listen to and feel it flowing around you and in you. One song, in particular is so sadly sweet that it makes you want to cry. 'The Breaking of the Fellowship' is especially breathtakingly lovely:), but all of the songs are absalutely beautiful. So, as you can guess, I would definitely recommend this cd.:)
B00005N9CV|2.0|The blame for this poor cd must rest with Tommy Lipuma and Klaus Ogermann. They ovewhelm Ms Krall completly with syrupy one paced arrangements of beautiful songs, on her previous album at least there were sparky trio and quartet tunes to stop it being too sweet. Get a new producer and go back to the small group format, it's what you do best.
B00005QCVT|5.0|Daniel Aranofsky's follow-up to Pi is a much darker tale of the dangers of drug abuse and addiction. Some may say that Aranofsky goes to far in showing us the vile debasements that go along with a drug problem, and for many people Traffic or Blow might be sufficient. But what makes this movie stand out from all the rest (aside from a fantastic cast) is the way it conveys the romanticism associated with drugs in our culture today.<br />I believe that this film is one of the most powerful anti-drug messages ever created, but it doesn't deny the fact that there's an allure to drugs, be they over the counter medication or illicit substances.<br />Artistically, the movie is terrific. The soundtrack is just perfect, and the split cameras are something rarely seen.<br />All in all, this film is fantastic. But if you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, steer far clear.
B00005QEO2|5.0|What surprised me most was that Aerosmith acutually released 2 cds in the same year, albeit one was a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation but still it hasnt been done since the early 90's. (remember those). <BR>Anyhow, on with the review.  I feel that the song selection was better than the original Geffen greatest hits, &quot;Big Ones&quot;.  But since every track from Big ones is on Young Lust it propels it that much further.  Overall it does a good job of collecting such great B sides such as &quot;Hangman Jury&quot; and &quot;Heart's Done Time&quot;,from Permanent Vacation or even the addition of a cover of The Door's &quot;Love me Two Times&quot;. Impeccably done by the Boston Boys.  Plus if that wasn't enough to have you streaming to the nearest record store it has 3 new studio songs, so if the math is correct there was a total of 15 new Aerosmith songs in 2001.<BR>Overall opinion, run out and buy this cd.  Its worth it.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|Barry is straining a bit, and the the audio isnt as nicely seperated as in Eagles's dvd, but! this is the BeeGees! I'm just glad they still perform, to give us the oportunity to enjoy them with today's great home theater electronics!<BR>it's amazing how good they sound.
067101756X|5.0|Corso discusses his career in caretaking the original Roswell files and the ongoing coverup of alien-human interactions by the US govt.Corso claims that many in Roswell were paid off, threatened with violence to them and/or their families, or made to look mentally ill if they discussed what really happened in Roswell.<br />Corso also goes on to say that individuals charged with investigating alien technology later funneled through government contractors as discrete patents from reverse engineered craft technology were or have been in constant danger of murder by government personnel in other agencies. Corso claims to have been a high ranked intelligence official at a time when the US govt itself was highly compromised by hostile foreign governments.<br />If true, much of the technology boom we have seen past 50 yrs is result of copying or modifying alien technology. And the US govt has declared war on these aliens because of analysis of their 'intent', and not an ongoing dialogue.
B00000K0DT|5.0|Not sure that I can add too much to the other reviews that have been posted here, but the Usual Suspects is just a top-notch flick. Few movies are as successful at keeping the viewer in suspense, and even fewer have such a fantastic cast. Gabriel Byrne and Benecio Del Toro were great, while Kevin Spacey was tremendous. One of the best films in its genre.

6305558167|4.0|Pretense knows no bounds, apparently.  When exactly did folks like alexislounor (really?) lose the ability to be entertained for the sake of entertainent alone.  This film is nothing more or less than the Arthurian Legend for the masses, and a great story is still nothing but.  If a film review by ANYONE claims that the Arthurian Legend has not been treated &quot;realistically&quot; (see alexislounor), do yourself a favor and run screaming in the opposite direction.  This is a well-made film by an underrated director.
0385505833|4.0|I've read several of Grisham's novels, and have enjoyed them all, Skipping Christmas, is no exception.  I never knew he had such a flair for writing a comical, whimsical story, the main character, Luther, is a very funny study in what happens when one gets to overwhelmed by the holiday.  I recommend this to anybody who has got the bah-humbug spirit, it may change your outlook.

B000002UAI|5.0|&quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; has long been my favorite release by the group.  Friends would say &quot;What about Sgt Pepper or the &quot;White Album&quot;?  While everything they did stands as a classic, I have a weakness for their earlier stuff.  Everything on this album is a standout (a personal fave is the underrated &quot;What You're Doing&quot;) and with all due respect to Chuck Berry, John rips &quot;Rock And Roll Music&quot; like no other man could!  Although the mono sound of the CD detracts from the enjoyment (I suggest fans seek out underground stereo CDs imported from Japan &amp; Germany to truly get the impact) the album will always stand large in my Beatles collection.  A masterpiece!
0380796090|4.0|You will be sucked into this book from the first page.  Immediately, you are introduced to Claire, who speaks to the reader in first person.  Claire has just given birth to a baby girl, and her husband subsequently arrives and tells her that he is leaving her.  Immediately upon release from the hospital, she leaves her London home with her new baby, Kate, and goes back to her parents, who live in Dublin.  <br />You will find that you really get to know Claire as she goes through so many emotional states- depression, anger, and love for her new child.  Claire tries to fill the void left by her husband by dating again, and she finds that she is very attracted to Adam.  The problem is that Adam is friends with her younger sister!<br />The only thing I did not like about this book was Claire's sound off near the end of the book regarding abortion.  No matter how you feel about this hot button issue, I did not think it was appropriate for Ms. Keyes to interject her opinions in the way that she did.  This book is supposed to be fun, and this particular section distracted me.  <br />However, I'm not holding it against this book!  Read it- you will love it!
0385505833|5.0|I read this book in one day.  I could not put it down I wanted to know what happened next.  I read it about a week before Christmas and I laughed and cried all at the same time.  It really will touch a nerve if not your heart.  I bought 2 more copies and gave them as Chrismas qifts.  I will be buying more copies for gifts next year.  I hope he writes another book like this one.  Maybe a series.
B000059HCN|5.0|Acting, filming, music, writing -- everything fit for a unified vision.  The actors and the direction made me feel what was occuring in these people's lives. One of the best films I've seen.  (although there are other good movies in the same genre such as Trainspotting) <BR>Requeim for a dream is about people who have hopes and dreams and feel like they stand a chance in life.  But by the end --- each of them is alone -- mother from son, boyfriend from girlfriend, and friend from friend -- and none of them can help one another even though they love each another.  Beautiful and heartbreaking.
B00005JKT8|3.0|Kate McKay(Meg Ryan)cringes at the sight of her colleague engrossed in a Christine Feehan romantic novel. That's probably the reaction of the cynics in the theater watching the impossibly romantic time-travel movie Kate and Leopald. Overdosed with escapism and fluttering fantasies, Kate and Leopald is a date-movie with an uninpsired plot about Leopald ( Hugh Jackman), Duke of Albany unwittingly crosses a portal from 1876 to the present while chasing his great-great grandson (Liev Schreiber) who discovered this time passage.<br />Soon a comedy of manners and culture-shock manifests as Mahattan executive Kate is charmed by the gentlemanly Leopald. She falls in love hopelessly, struggling with realities in her job and convincing herself that Leopald remains a pedestrian. But when she finally surrenders to passion, Leopald returns to his time to await for the revelation on his new bride...<br />Director James Mangold (Girl, interrupted) shrewdly avoids the complications of time-travel and swiftly dishes up the romantic journey with precision. The obsolete plot is salvaged by the impeccable casting of Hugh Jackman, whose charming portrayal and luminous screen prescence garners him a Golden Globe nomination. Meg Ryan returns to what she does best as in You've Got Mail. Addicted to Love, chalking up a mediocre performance. Though entertaining, it remains at best a light charmer on love and fluffy romance on wings that may fly out of your mind as soon as you are out from the theater. Timeless romance it isn't.
B00005O5CM|3.0|Maybe I'm too picky.  Maybe I was looking for something totally different.  It could have been my mood.  I just didn't enjoy this film as much as I expected.  There were moments when I laughed out loud, but I couldn't tell you now what I laughed at.  The moments I do remember are the ones that made me not like the movie.<br />Reese Witherspoon gives a likable performance.  Having very blond roots though I was expecting to see more analysis, not just tricks pulled out of a hat when you just need to know how permed hair is treated to win a case.  I wanted her to succeed, and was glad when she did, but I never quite made it to what I'd call cheering for her.  <br />The relationships in the film also fell flat.  With one exception. Watching her help the manicurist first get her puppy back and then bolster her courage to get the man she wants was the best relationship in the film.  <br />After all that complaining you might wonder why I bothered to give &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.  The fact was I did enjoy watching it.  I just don't feel that it's one for the keeper shelf.
B00005R87Q|5.0|First things first. This is a guy movie. There is close to nothing that will peak the interest of women in this movie. There are no sappy love stories, no people traveling around the world to win back their lover's hearts. No, instead there's pulse-pounding action, unbelievable stunts, lots of high-tech racing cars, and LOTS OF WOMEN. Girls making out with each other and lots of skin makes this movie that much better. If this is your kind of movie, get it. You won't be disappointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd is by far one of the best cds i have perchesed.  unlike limp bizkit there is no cussing.  this cd is worth every penny u pay for it.

B00003CXXJ|2.0|Shrek (Mike Myers) is a big, green ogre who lives alone in a swamp and wants to keep it that way.  His beloved swamp is soon overrun with fairy-tale folk who have been evicted from Lord Farquaad's (John Lithgow) kingdom and must now settle in the swamp.  Also invading his privacy is a smart-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) who is determined to make a friend of the ogre.  In order to rid  his swamp of the fairy-tale creatures, Shrek pays a visit to Lord Farquaad, a diminutive, nasty man who has schemed to get the deed to Shrek's swamp.....and succeeded.  Farquaad agrees to give the deed back to Shrek if the ogre will rescue the fair princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the tower of a dilapidated castle so the lord can marry her.  The castle is protected by a fire breathing dragon but Shrek and Donkey outwit the dragon and rescue the princess.  On the journey back to Farquaad's kingdom, Shrek and Fiona fall in love but Fiona is set on marrying Farquaad thinking that \\"love's first kiss\\" will dispel a curse that she has fallen under.  But true love wins out in the end.  Pretty predictable ending.<br />I was very disappointed when I saw this movie for the first time.  It fell way short of all the hype!  This is not appropriate for very young children as they will not be able to follow the storyline and the movie does have adult humor.  Older children will probably enjoy the \\"potty\\" humor but I really don't think this movie should be viewed by anyone under 15/16.  Call me a prude if you want, but I don't think a movie aimed at children should have any adult humor in it and I'm not necessarily talking about the potty humor.  The only things I liked about this DVD were the computer animation, which was wonderful, and the bonus features on the 2-disc set, which were fun.  But I will admit that my 28-year old son thought the movie was hilarious.  He said it was the best computer animated movie he had ever seen and he has watched it again and again.
B000002KDM|5.0|Others say James Taylor's third album, Mud Slide Slim, surpasses the excellent and more popular Sweet Baby James, and I fully agree.  Mud Slide Slim is loaded with depth, creativity, and beauty.... James gives his audience every penny's worth on this classic recording.  Taylor's voice and guitar work are tremendous on this effort, plus the accompanying musicians do a fine job.  <br />My favorite songs include You Can Close Your Eyes, Mud Slide Slim, Highway Song, and Long Ago and Far Away, and Hey, Mister, That's me up on the Jukebox.  The reality is, however, they're all great tracks on this one.<br />On Mud Slide Slim, James Taylor speaks to people who have suffered, feel the difficulty of living, and willingly confront the bittersweet quality of existence.  He touches and consoles the listener with his songwriting and musical talent. This album showcases his considerable artistic capacity a young man, but   the content is still relevant now (30 years later).  Mud Slide Slim is worthy of a special place in your c.d. collection.

Well nevermind started the anti movement of glam rock to breed out a new kind of sound. Nevermind's songs are original and important. They tell the story of Kurt Cobain (my icon)and his genius about ideas and experiances in the world. Nirvana today will be hailed as the gods of rock and roll and nevermind set them off to be rock and roll gods.

I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series. <br />I was weary at first and the Japanese chain of command was a little baffling in the beginning, however once the novel got going I could not put it down.
B00004STDN|5.0|This movie is incredible. it`s got all you can expect from an action movie, You can really feel how your stomack is twisting when the lady falls in the opening scene. i have seen a lot of movies and this one is really great<br />Jonas Kjoeniksen
0060273224|5.0|A great book! I had gotten this book for Christmas and I wasreluctant to read it. It looked like a long boring book. I smiled and said thank you, knowing that it might sit on my shelf for a long time. I decided to take it on a trip up north and I was in for a BIG surprise! I was by the fire and I started to read it trying to get it out of the way. I started it, and it was a little slow at first but it got faster. It turned out to be a book I couldn't put down! Intriguing characters, that are wonderful and believable! Also, Sabriel wasn't always mastering every challenage high above standards. I finished the book and went straight out to Borders (sorry Amazon) to buy the second book in the series, Lirael. The main plot constists of a girl whose father, the Abhorsen (a necromancer who fights the evils of other necromancers), has fallen into Death and needs help getting out. Sabriel has to take her father's place as the Abhorsen, try to save him, and try to save the kingdom. A great book in all!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The story behind this movie is not very original as has been pointed out. This is a deliberate retelling of La Dame aux camlias or Camille by Dumas, a story which has been portrayed more often than it is possible to count. This is however the most original version based on that theme in a long while (since Verdi's La Traviata in my opinion). In fact this is one of the most visually and musically splendid films I've seen as well as one of the funniest. For instance when Zidler started speaking the lyrics from Like a Virgin the theater erupted in laughter (as on many other occasions). <BR>P.S. My experience after seeing it a few times with different people is that those who are not well acquainted with the (mostly well known) songs and lyrics beforehand are not quite able to appreciate the humour and irony of this movie. However everybody I know has been able to enjoy it as a great musical.
B000001FOL|3.0|Nico's contribution to modern music is undeniable.  Drawing from medievil organ sounds and classical European orchestration, two of her albums (&quot;Desertshore&quot; and &quot;The End&quot;) were ingenious collections of songs that owed nothing to any musical trends that were happening at the time.  &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; is Nico's first album after the Velvets, and while good in its own right, the songs here are so far apart from her later work that I would be surprised if fans could stomach listening to it.  Nico's voice seems to accompany the 60's folk melodies nicely; &quot;The Fairest of Seasons&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot; are a wonderful opening for the album, but everything afterwards felt a bit awkward.  Her voice is sometimes overpowered by the constant violin stabs and flute playing.  Bob Dylan's &quot;I'll Keep it With Mine&quot; surprisingly fits however with Nico's singing and the instrumentation isn't as overblown as some of the other tracks.  The album's highlight is the title track, which is insanely beautiful and dark.
0395873460|5.0|There is no question that J.R.R. Tolkien's story of The Hobbit is outstanding literature, so I will keep this review strictly to specifically the Alan Lee illustrated hard cover edition.  Many people feel that the only high quality hard covers are leather bound.  This book should quickly prove this to be false. Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth covering with a beautiful gold dragon in the lower right corner (non other than Smaug himself).  The pages are crisp and bright white, not a hint of yellow.  The illustrations, scattered generously throughout, are both in color and in black and white and intermingle beautifully with the story.  Alan Lee has truely captured Tolkien's characters better than any of the other artists who have tried.  The detail in each illustration was enough to hold my attention for quite some time and definately added to my enjoyment of this timeless classic.  Whoever feels pictures are for children needs to purchase this book and find the child in himself again.
B000002UZ4|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys are among the key synthesizer players of the 80's, along with Depeche Mode (which later turned to guitars), Kraftwerk, Eurythmics, Human League, and others. But this twosome is the definitive synth group for the dance hall. The duo started with various kinds of beats with very melodious riffs and tracks, until they settled with techno. In fact, one can consider this group one of the masters of techno. <br />It is good that they put in all fast songs save one, which is in my favor. Upbeatness and speed make very lively music, and when you combine them with synth sound, you have otherworldy beautiful music. 17 cool tracks dominate this CD, and you should have this if you are a serious definitive 80's music connosieur.

0312932081|5.0|Of course, I will always be a bigger and better fan of Bean and his 'adventures' (bleh) in Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon, you can't read one without the other. Insightful, heart-tearing, honest and fun, this book is everything other science fiction books AREN'T!
0767802659|4.0|I'm honored (I think!) to write the 500th review for \\"Starship Troopers.\\"<br />I'd almost passed it by because of the mixed and negative reviews. Glad I didn't, because it's a gloriously nasty anti-war/anti-fascist satire.<br />\\"Starship Troopers\\" is scripted as a parody of World War II war flicks, and (except for the over-the-top government broadcasts and recruiting ads) played absolutely straight by the writers and the director.<br />This doesn't keep the film from being hysterically funny. The sequence in which Dizzy is attacked by an arachnid and dies had me rolling on the floor in laughter. (If you don't \\"get\\" the humor, write me and I'll explain.) It's almost as good a send-up of the \\"I'm dying -- go on without me\\" scenes from war films as Doe Dante's parody of 50's scifi/horror films in \\"Matinee\\" (also recommended).<br />The satire is so subtle it's not surprising slow-witted reviewers saw the film as a glorification of mindless patriotism. One easily missed point comes near the end when the psychic contacts the brain bug and announces -- to universal cheering -- that the bugs are frightened. The obvious next step -- using this ability to communicate and end the war -- doesn't occur.<br />...<br />The DVD transfer is one of the best I've seen -- detailed, razor-sharp, and vividly colored, with little or no overshoot or ringing.<br />Strongly recommended to every adult viewer, even if you can't stomach Paul Verhoeven's obvious glee in ripping people in half. Definitely worth viewing with your children, so you can discuss the film's politics and Weltanschauung.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Well, here it is, after about ten years, we finally see the sequel to Thomas Harris' novel and Jonathan Demme's film Silence of the Lambs. To me the Director Ridley Scott hasn't captured the exquisitly written essence of Thomas Harris' novel. It's set a few years after the silence of the lambs, where the facsinating Dr. Hannibal Lecter ( who else, but Anthony Hopkins) has escaped to italy from the US. He has found a new residence in beautiful florence, safe from the horrors of his previous dungeon in baltimore. All of a sudden everyone seems to be out for his capture, which leads to a cat and mouse game with his love, Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, who came in because Jodie Foster stayed away from the sequel). <br />To those who have read and enjoyed the book, the film may seem rushed. To me'Hannibal'(the film) seems to hurry along with out ever stopping to admire itself in the mirror. Ridley scott described some of the deleted scenes in the DVD as taking too much time, but i felt the film needed lots of slow movement to get the tension going, which was done so well in the silence of the lambs. <br />'Hannibal' has few, but very strong scenes of 'violence' (one of them could be better described as 'dinner'. For those who havnt read the book and are very squirmish, be warned.<br />The DVD does packs in a huge amount of features which does the film justice. On it, are the deleted scenes, the making, commentary from ridley scott, and much more. If you have a DVD player, and have enjoyed the VHS version, then this is a must.<br />Overall, 3 for the film,4.5 for the DVD.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Like Peter Jackson who saw this project to fruition, Howard Shore shocked so many by 'hitting it out of the ballpark.'  I was concerned and yet piqued by the prospect of Shore scoring the LOTR films, yet it proved to be an absolutely correct choice by Jackson for the project.  It was said that Jackson was also considering Wojicech (Bram Stoker's Dracula) Kilar, and you can really hear the emotive quality he was after that could support such a possibility--this score has gorgeously eerie layered choruses, exciting percussion, evocative strings and majestic flute and brass.  The music both compliments the cinematic action to perfection and stands on its own brilliantly...I play it on repeat and it refuses to tire me out (I even like the doggone Enya tunes)!  This is no 'one trick pony' either, manipulating sonic emotions through assault or obviousness...it is a score of subtletly, complexity and richness.  Even my Star Wars/John Williams-junkie friend admits that this score moves him to tears, especially &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship.&quot;  I can hardly wait to see and hear what PJ and Maestro Howard Shore have in wait for us in THE TWO TOWERS and the climactic RETURN OF THE KING!  If the Academy does not give this the Original Score Oscar, they are deaf as well as blind.  I fully expect that AOL-TW will also cash in and release a second soundtrack CD or an expanded edition in the future, for the movie holds something like 2 1/2 hours of music cues of which this is only a highlights sampler.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Hearing that opening line from Parallel Line's Pretty Baby I'm  reminded of why I love Blondie so much: they represent pop music at it's most unique and intelligent. Debbie Harry and Chris Stein were pushing 40 back in the glory days of Parallel Lines. They were old enough to have established points of view and pretty much stuck to them. They were slightly retro, girl group and sci-fi obsessed New Yorkers. Their success came when they teamed up with L.A. based producer Mike Chapman (who also produced most of Pat Benatar's best work). In his new and enlightening liner notes Chapman explains how he tamed Blondie.  <BR>This album is full of high energy, hook filled, infectious pop. It includes the now classic Heart of Glass in it's hit version as well as in an earlier less polished version. Other highlights include Fade Away and Radiate, a sci-fi pop dirge (by this time a Blondie staple) with an incredible guitar solo by Robert Fripp and Debbie's James Cagney inspired vocals on One Way Or The Other, where she states that she's &quot;gonna getcha getcha getcha&quot;.<BR>My only complaint is that this reissue does not include the lyrics as the original album did. The remastering is brilliant and brings out the wonderful arrangements enabling you to hear the strong contributions by all the band members, especially the keyboard playing of Jimmy Destri.<BR>By the way, the CD's opener is a cover version of The Nails' &quot;Hanging On The Telephone&quot;.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Not that some of these songs weren't great by their original artists, but Baz Lurhmann's usage of them in telling the story of Moulin Rouge makes these songs more fun and even more powerful. I am usually not a huge fan of Music Theater, but Baz's attempt to bring it back to the cinema is a worthy artistic try.<br />The movie itself is overall great, at least original and contains great art direction. I personally prefer the first half of the film, and I feel the same way about this Soundtrack. All the excitement and extravagance is all in the front. Unlike some musicals (ie:RENT), the album itself does not tell the story alone. Most of the music must be thought of in context of the film's settings and dialogue.<br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor may not be the best singers, but there is a nice \\"real\\" quality to their voices that will soon have you singing along. The \\"Elephant Medley\\" is wonderful and always a fun montage of pop love songs to hear (its the only way I can stand listening to \\"I will always love you\\"). Lady Marmalade is the cut you are familiar with from the MTV video, but not the mix that is in the film.<br />What I am sad to see missing on this Soundtrack that is wonderful in the film is the more whymsical numbers such as \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\"/\\"Sound of Music\\"/\\"Freedom\\"/\\"Children of the Revolution\\" medlies from the boho's (\\"the Pitch\\" and the Green Fairy), and the hilarious \\"Like a Virgin\\" number. I'd prefer if they left out \\"Fly Away\\" by kidman in exhange for one of those missing uptempo humourous songs. But alas, overall this is a great album to have in your collection for at least its uniqueness and pop-culture fun.

B00005N5S5|5.0|This special edition DVD is very well done, with surprising special features, deleted scenes and an excellent transfer. It is a pleasure to watch this classic with such clarity and stereo surround sound. A must for Schwarzenegger fans.<BR>    The Terminator, is a time capsule of Arnold at his very best. This movie is most likely responsible, for the 15 year action star movie craze that hit the US in the mid to late 80's and dried out by 2000. Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Segal and others have all been successful in this genre, but all pale in comparison to Schwarzenneger. The combination of his gigantic muscles, Austrian accent and strong screen presence, have carried him much further than his mediocre acting alone could ever have. <BR>    The Terminator is probably Arnold's most memorable performance, due to a groundbreaking director (James Cameron), coupled with Arnold being near his physical peak. This is why the movie has become a cult classic. It's not very often you see a director take an action/sci-fi movie seriously enough to do a brilliant job. Cameron is a master at this. Both men would go on to work together in future films, in which all would be extremely successful. But this is the one that started it all.<BR>    As the popularity of the action stars have waned in the last few years, Arnold appears to be one of the last that is still remotely successful. In his fifties now, with his aging physique and the public interest turning toward new genres, his popularity has faded considerably. As Arnold may get older, this movie does not. To see the worlds greatest action star at his peak, all you have to do is watch this classic. &quot;I'll be back&quot;
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica totally kicks butt with the release of the DVD companion to the incredible CD S &amp; M with the San Francisco Symphony.  Metallica is one of my favorite bands (if not the favorite) and I love how they completely reinvent themselves every couple of years.  The Black album was a complete departure for them from their earlier stuff.  And yet, working with Bob Rock they produced a great album in my humble opinion.  Every since the Black album, they've been constantly evolving as musicians and I think this DVD is another step in that evolution.  Never afraid to try new things, Metallica gets together with the San Francisco Symphony to create magic.<br />This is a MUST OWN DVD for anyone that likes Metallica.  Several of my friends that aren't nuts about Metallica love this DVD.  Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Symphony do a great job in working the Metallica making instant classics out of these songs.  Starting with the Ecstasy of Gold (The Gold, Bad and the ugly) to some of the old favorites including Master of Puppets, Sad but true, Battery, One, Enter Sandman, For whom the bell tolls, Devil's Dance to the new songs No Leaf Clover (my favorite) and Human, this DVD is non-stop action that will have you singing and moshing along.

B00005U2LM|5.0|People need to stop harping on about 36 Chambers.  That was 1993 and its over.  I dont want to hear another 36 Chambers because I already own a copy.  I want to hear new Wu and this time Rza really brought it.<br />This is an excellent album, close to classic proportions.  The production is tight on every song and the lyrics especially from the Gza, Method Man and Inspectah Deck are superb.  Even the much-maligned U-God comes correct with some funky vocal delivery on 'Soul Power' and 'The Uzi'.<br />The beats on these songs are severely head nodding and very different to what we have previously heard from the Wu.  Only 'Y'all Been Warned' and 'Iron Flag' carry that traditional Wu sound.  On the other hand Rza really brings the noise with a Public Enemy style noise attack on 'Radioactive' and the highly charged 'In the Hood' is an exciting start to the album. My only complaints really are the RnB singing on 'Chrome Wheels' and 'Back in the Game' although I think it works really well on the compassionate 'Babies'.<br />Time to stop judging the Wu on ancient history and to recognise the quality of the New Wu Order.  This album may be hard to get your head around at first but it is seductive and will suck you in.  Its a good thing they brought the glock so they can use it on those babies who keep whining about 36 Chambers.
B00005RIKD|5.0|An absolute jewel for anyone that loves Sting.<br />...All This Time by Sting is the live album recorded on Sept 11 of all days.  In this album, Sting revisits a lot of the classics from the early days and re-records them.  Sting is an incredible musician and he takes a lot of the great Sting and Police classics and reinvests them with a very jazzy twist.<br />My favorites in this collection have to be `Fields of Gold' and `Fragile'.  I always loved Fields of gold and I just love this simple new version.  Fragile is another beautiful song that just stays with you.  In a nutshell, this is a great album and a must for any Sting fan.

B00005QK3W|5.0|This album blew me away the first time I heard it, and it just gets stronger with each listening. Yes, I know, lyrically it's so-so (&quot;1-2-3-4-5...let's go for a drive&quot;) but who cares!! The title track quoted here is &quot;feel-good&quot; music by one of the greats. The album covers a range of emotions while at the same time it gives us die-hard Macca fans the melodic beauty we've always expected from him (and usually always get). I think it's far better than &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; in its range; while FP is a good listen, there are some slack spots within that album; &quot;Driving Rain&quot; seems to have more overall ENERGY. &quot;About You&quot;, &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again&quot;, &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, and &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; are highlights, although the whole album in general is strong.  My only quibble is with &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;....it goes on juuuuuuuuust a tad too long....(sometimes less is more, for maximum impact). But hey, it's a minor quibble. This is Macca in the tradition of &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and the second side of &quot;Tug of War&quot; (we used to have vinyl records here in the states for anyone who wonders what a &quot;second side&quot; is!) All in all, it's my favorite solo Macca album since &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;, and far better than his mid 80s tripe a la &quot;Pipes of Peace&quot; and &quot;Press to Play&quot; (even to this day I don't understand the point of &quot;Talk More Talk&quot; from that album...what on earth was THAT weak track all about??) But I'm getting off the topic. Get &quot;Driving Rain&quot; today. You won't be disappointed.
0446364495|1.0|This book is essentially worthless drivel. &quot;He moves like a gazelle..&quot; ?!? Is the author serious? To say the book is cliche ridden is an understatement. The writing is sophomoric and the characters are developed not in action, but in ridiculous cliched descriptions like the gazelle simile.  The saddest thing is that this could have been a great story. The plot has potential. A long lost forbidden and passionate love affair, discovered after the two main players are deceased. The woman's children having to figure out what happened years ago based on their dead mother's diary. This book could have been brilliant and instead its like a bad passage from the Song of Soloman. Don't waste your time reading this rubbish.
0792846338|5.0|there is some superb acting here in this classic film. Not just from Kathy Bates, whose performance is stunning, but also, James Caan does very well as Paul Sheldon. There is also a very good performance from \\"Buster\\" (no idea of the actors name). <BR>The suspense here is unbelieveable, you can practically taste it. I've yet to read the book (although i do own it) and if it is anywhere near as good as this film, i will love it. <br />The plot is rather strange, but you learn to expect that from things by Stephen king.<br />It is a very powerful film, and there are some moments from it that will stay with me forver (for example, the sledgehammer incident)> the way Bates character is slowly exposed as a psycopath is very, very, well done. At first you're thinking \\"what a nice, kind woman\\" but then, as you gradually see a different side to her, the character is chilling. <br />The ending is very good, showing Paul Sheldon using his brain. However, in King's book, On Writing, he tells of how he had had a different ending in mind....

B00005OWIU|4.0|Good God!!..John Williams this soundtrack is fantastic. Buy it!! Track after track it is unbroken in quality. When up against other pieces of John Williams work such as the 'Star Wars' music, this really is something to love over and over again! My personal favourite tracks are tracks: 3)The Arrival of Baby Harry 4)Visit to the Zoo and letters from Hogwarts 16)The Chess Game and 19)Hedwigs Theme. Those tracks are magnificent...so energetic, loud and atmospheric, they really do suck you in and each of them lasts for an incredibly decent length of time just like all the others. With a maximum of 19 tracks each 5mins minimum and the extra bonus CD ROM this is the ultimate movie soundtrack, classical album and movie clip companion. Well done John, it it remarkable!!

Not in my family, nor any of the other hundreds of other Irish families I knew growing up, and still know.  This book is a disgrace to any ethnic group.

1558216847|1.0|This book enjoyed a great vogue when it was first published in the U.K. However, it wasn't long before it was exposed as a work of fiction, notably by Peter Fleming, Ian's explorer brother, in an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Fleming knew much of the area well, and the only detail from his critique I can recall after 40 years was the striking omission by Rawicz of his having crossed a road in the Gobi desert, lined with telegraph poles, and carring regular traffic.<BR>Gripping yarn, pity about the facts.

B00005QDW1|4.0|After reading several reviews I bought this cd.  At first I wasn't sure how I'd like it, but I loved Tragic Kingdom so I went ahead and purchased it.  Well, I think it's a great cd.  It's more dance style beats like Tragic Kingdom was.  If you're looking for a cd with deep lyrics, etc. then don't buy this cd, but if you want a cd with cool songs that aren't boring to listen to, then this is the one for you.
0316776963|5.0|Although I will say right away that Sedaris's humor is probably not for everyone, if you like his brand of sarcasm, this is the book for you. &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; had me and my husband snorting with laughter as we tried to tell each other our favorite lines from the chapter. And Sedaris's stint as an inept writing instructor will be appreciated by anyone who has sat through a writing workshop and wondered about the person teaching it. Wonderful, hilarious, intelligent. Can't wait to read his other stuff.
0446608955|5.0|I'd heard of this book a while before. It grazed the shelf of my favourite bookstore for sometime before I finally gave it a second glance. And I never looked back. Not only is this book written with style, and class..but its pure bliss to read. Its a love story..but not a Romance Novel. Something, that i'm sure numerous people can relate to. Definatley a book I'll be reading again in the soon future.
B00005R2M3|5.0|if you look past the color of her hair, and what language she's singing in, and forget about the comparisons to all the flavor of the week chick singers that are out today and just listen to the music, you'll find a wonderful artist who will be putting out great songs long after brittany spears, cristina aguilara, and alanis morrisette are in the cut out bin at the local record stores. <BR>laundry service is a great album with a nice variety of songs and styles, the musicianship is first class and her voice is great. i couldn't ask for much more!
B00003CX9S|5.0|&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; is the ultimate David Lynch...that's a given.  But this DVD packaging contains not only this stunning black and white film but also some excellent retrospectives of the camera work, the acting, and the make up.  This compilation is a fine example of the contribution that DVD presentations make to the art of film.
0788811355|4.0|Well, so much for the days of &quot;if you can't say anything nice....&quot;.   I don't mind people disagreeing with me, (as one reviewer wisely said, &quot;Your review reveals a lot about your tastes&quot;) but when one needs to lambaste a film that is, by all accounts, well produced, I simply must Re-act.  Trying to compare this film (or any other film for that matter)  to others is like trying to compare animal species.  Some may look similar but they ARE vastly different.<br />This movie on its own should be commended for its lush cinematography, brilliant actors, sweeping muscial score and fine war-era costumes.  Since this film was  publicly unpopular, it of course won 9 Academy Awards, just like in years past.  I believe the Academy got it Right.  <br />To those who (or know how to) care, give this near 3 hour movie a try.  True, the main love story is adulterous,(I enjoyed far more the story of Hana and Kip), but the entire cast, including the desert, kept me involved.     Lastly, I have yet to read the novel, since being a former drama student, you learn that different mediums  require different approaches, so to compare book and film, for me, is without merit.   The English Patient, the movie, however, is worth while and worth seeing.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Currently my all time favorite CD. This one deserves a Grammy!<BR>Diana's sensual voice with the lush orchestration lifts me up and makes me feel so good! Thank you Diana for this beautiful album.<br />When I read the cover and saw the names Klaus Ogerman, Tommy LiPuma and Al Schmitt I remembered them from some of my previous favorite CDs. The Look of Love is impeccible and timeless. In a word, perfection! Every song; including Besame Mucho!<br />...It seems evident to me that Diana is evolving and growing as an artist in a natural way that is clearly the result of pure talent and not the result of pressure from the marketing department!
B0000027I6|4.0|Very good album, very good! Much better IMO than Final Cut, but I prefered Radio KAOS, it had a story narrative very appealing to me, but Amused to Death is a very good album, it should have done a lot better in selling point that did but...
0385484518|5.0|I have terminal cancer and when I rented the movie &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; I fell completely in love with Morrie and Mitch became my son. In watching Morrie go through his journey and Mitch through his own, my journey is now calmer, less painful and a lot more loving.<BR>There is no reason why anyone would not enjoy and gain from this book. I believe even the coldest heart would be warmed after reading this book or simply seeing the movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|What can a person say to describe Moulin Rouge? I have heard many hardened critics say they were &quot;blown away&quot;, or that the Spectacular cinema spectacle was the best movie of the year. The acting is top class, with Nicole Kidman, Ewan MacGregor and Jim Broadbent particulary impressive but, with this impressive movie to fall back on it would have been easy for the DVD to have been released with minimal fuss and effort, as if any a movie could sell itself this would have been it. But, as seems to be the case with him, director Baz Lurhman didn't feel content to merely release the film by it's own, so he came up with a 2 disc DVD extravaganza!<br />The first DVD features the film, as well as the commentaries and other hidden features but the second disk is filled with nearly 2 hours of additional footage including an impressive making of the movie, interviews with the stars, trailers, music videos, cut scenes, extended dances with multi-angle viewing capability, early script drafts as well as photo galleries and a whole host of other extras. This DVD is by far one of the best I have seen and I would honestly reccomend this to anyone: to put it simply; no DVD collection will be complete without this modern classic in it. Buy it now!!
B00003CXDD|1.0|Anyone old enough to remember the world before Star Wars should avoid this movie.Although it contained state of the art FX (like JP III), it's script is one boring rip off of many classic fairy tales , retold badly.It's the primer for how not to use &quot;Great FX&quot; to stop the story from engaging the audience.If you are an FX fanantic and really want to check them out just fast foward through the un-&quot;dramatic&quot; dialogue.
B000002U9W|4.0|On 1970's Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd displayed their wry sense of humor. The band teamed up with television score-composer, Ron Gessin for two lengthy, somewhat smirky instrumentals: the title suite, a swirling composition so intricate and high-flying I almost suspect that Floyd and Gessin were parodying the trend of classical-infused, progressive rock and \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,\\" a gentle composition that revolves around sound effects of Pink Floyd roady, Alan Stiles, preparing his breakfast. The three songs sandwiched between the opuses, \\"If,\\" \\"Summer '68\\" and \\"Old Fat Sun\\" are the most coy and clever (in the cute popsong sense of the word) the band released since the departure of psychedelic song-smith, Syd Barrett two years prior. Needless to say, Atom Heart Mother is not exactly Dark Side of the Moon or the Wall. Still, the album's complex humor does not fall flat. If you uphold a methodical enough approach to music, this colorful, imaginative album is a radiant hoot.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|DVD extras are all very well, but they are meaningless without the movie itself--and here Disney's remastered, restored, and digitalized SNOW WHITE lives up to every bit of the press it has received.  Even now, some seventy years after it was first seen, this simple version of the famous Grimm fairy-tale can still cast a spell through storytelling pure and simple.  And the DVD formatted film is astonishingly beautiful--brilliantly colored--incredibly clear--so beautiful that no matter how often you may have seen the film in the past you will feel that you now see it for the first time.<br />The extras are enough to fill out a second disk and include everything from background art to timelines to trivia games.  Some of it is very interesting indeed; some of it I found rather tedious.  But... so what?  The important thing, the thing you're actually buying the DVD for, is SNOW WHITE, right? And with this DVD release, she remains the fairest in the land.
B000003BDJ|4.0|Very few bands in rock history can seriously be said to have released a string of hit singles as extraordinary as those of the Rolling Stones during their prime between 1964 and 1971. Stones songs from those years did much to define rock and roll as we know it today. Hot Rocks is a seminal collection of the band's finest hours. The first disc features their early work as rowdy, racy pop rockers. R&amp;B sensibilities, killer riffs and bad attitude loom over succinct, rollicking classics like \\"Get Off My Cloud,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" and \\"Satisfaction.\\" On the second disc, the band expand their sound with gritty honky tonk (\\"Street Fighting Man,\\" \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and the hilariously culturally insensitive \\"Brown Sugar\\") and daring epics (\\"Sympathy of the Devil,\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and the so-good-it-hurts \\"Gimme Shelter\\"). The only interruption of Hot Rocks' succession of bona fide rock classics is inexplicablely included, sluggish live version of \\"Midnight Rambler.\\" Still, the set is well worth purchasing. It is not every greatest hits package that features a hot streak as golden as this.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie was really good! I enjoyed it. I got it for Christmas and so far, I've watched it maybe twice a day since then. It grabs your attention. Probably more if you're a guy, but whatever... Reese Witherspoon is such a great actress, and she brought the movie to life! This review may be hard to go by, but if nothing I said helped just keep this in mind : Every movie gives off an atmosphere, whether it's funny, sad, dramatic, scarry, etc. They are the keys to a good movie. Legally Blonde has it all! Romance, comedy, some mystery... it's really worth it.
0345350472|4.0|In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, the title question symbolizes the moral conundrum of its protagonist, Rick Deckard. Deckard is a twenty first century cop who searches for and \\"retires\\" complex, lifelike androids who have permeated the population of a dusty, post-WWIII Earth. After experiencing feelings for Luba Loft, a robotic opera singer, Deckard becomes uncertain of the virtue of his job. Other characters who fuel his moral queries are Phil Reash, a fellow bounty hunter who takes sadistic pleasure in his work; John Isodore, a simpleton who feels useful for the first time when caring for a group of fugitive androids; Rachael Rosenberg, a robot with whom Deckard attempts to test the limits of his feelings for electronic creatures and Wilbur Mercer, a technicolor messiah who encourages him to disregard his feelings and simply carry out his job, acting more robotic himself. Throughout the novel, Dick never exactly settles any of his complex inquiries, but merely leaves them carefully set out for his more pensive readers to contemplate.
B00005RYKV|5.0|Though it lacks the subtle emotional resonance of Fireworks (Hana-Bi), Brother is nevertheless one of Takeshi Kitano's best films. It is certainly the most briskly paced, one of the best acted, and one of the most violent films in this master's oeuvre.<br />Kitano's brilliance lies in showing you things in unexpected ways, often by means of excluding parts of the action that would be considered essential in conventional editing. But the boldness of his choices, the stunning photography, and the sure-handed editing all combine so that his unusual shot selection seems perfectly natural, a result of economy and artistic conviction, rather than unnecessary quirk or a desire to show off. His is one of the most distinctive narrative voices in cinema today.<br />Kitano remains the perfect actor for his own directing and scripting. In Brother, as in Boiling Point, Kitano often takes the story away from his own character to explore supporting characters. But unlike in Boiling Point, here we have a supporting cast (headed by Omar Epps, who adapts into the Kitano style of comedy fluidly) thoroughly capable of holding our gaze, honororary mention going to Kuroudo Maki for his doggedly persistent portrayal of Yamamoto's younger half-brother Ken, Susumu Terajima as loyal (but also very funny) lieutenant Kato, and Masaya Kato as psychotic henchman Shirase.<br />The title Brother has a broader application in this film. The Epps-Kitano chemistry is enormous, surprising because it usually consists of only a couple of small gestures and a few lines of deadpan dialogue. Given its meaning in both Japanese gangster-speak (\\"aniki\\") and American vernacular, it's a brilliant choice for a title. And Kitano shows that he can make a film with American actors without sacrificing any of his distinctive style. A must-see for Kitano fans, to be sure, but also crucial viewing for all cinema lovers who relish seeing a master at his peak.
