B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Downloaded for kids and they all love it.  Lots of fun along with plenty of laughs.  Good for young kids.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Game is challenging and flawless.  Timed games are for you to beat your scores....and earn stars.  So many games that you will never tire of them.  Colorful backgrounds too.  So many nice features that work great on my kindle fire hd.  Would recommend this app to anyone.  And it's free.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I know everyone loves this film, but we found it very difficult to follow.  Reviewing the previous films might help. Also, the music track overwhelmed the voices which was very annoying and contributed to the confusion.  WHY do film makers run the music so loud???
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Everyone in my family enjoys this musical debut. Glad to see they are up for a Grammy.<br />Can wait for their next album.
0345529057|5.0|I bought these because I couldn't wait until the HBO show caught up.  You won't be disappointed with the outcome.  Lots of twist and turns.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|It was funny, compassionate and purely Clint Eastwood!!!  It will be a sad day when he retires the big screen no longer shines with this classic actor!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|great sound quality. the price was nice. the songs are great. if you like sarah and xmas buy this cd.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie...  Maybe I related too much in spots :-) but Meryl Streep seldom lets me down.  It's humorous and poignant in all the right places.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The product Worked well<br />I Would recommend<br />I Would buy again<br />Arrived on time as stated online<br />Very Cost effective
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is a guarantee that you will like to read a great historically set novel.  Blending real historical people with his &#34;cast of ccharacters&#34; shows he knows what he writes.  As a history major and an complete nut for well-written historical novels and factual fare, I was enthralled.  Having lived through WWII and the world today, I know the history.  Follett made it easy for me to relive those days.

B002NC8JEC|5.0|This Christmas classic speaks for itself, and the re-release containing additional tracks and personal holiday greetings from each of the boys make this the disc to get if you don't already own it. Is it worth another purchase if you have the original CD? If you are a big MJ / Jackson 5 fan, it's indeed a no-brainer purchase. For the casual fan, I would say it's not a must buy. The original disc is fine.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so addicting and so much fun. I love all the mini games you can unlock. But I wish there was a way to win more coins instead of downloading or having to sign up for thing s
B0052GACNM|5.0|Some of the best recordings I've ever listened to.  Saw a PBS special while they were recording this album...  utterly awesome, which made me order the album immediately!!!!!!!!!!!!  You don't know what you're missing, if your a Tony fan!
B0053O89JM|5.0|is the best serial is a form of life very interest i saw all serial complete he said very good words and very inteligent
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I'm a bit of a Luddite and don't need 20 different ways to watch a movie. This set was priced right and fit the bill for all my viewing requirements. Good price, great service, on-time delivery. Who could ask for more?
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Found this one to be challenging.  Really gets to be interesting when the blocks seem to fade into the background.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I bought this for my fiance for Christmas. We've listened to it several times and really enjoy it. Try it!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Don't like this book ,,, I rarely don't finish a book, but I can't get into this one.  Maybe it's me.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A good storyline that gives further creedance to life after death that was written by a cynical doctor with good humor.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product is wonderful during an ice storm. We were able to charge four phones during the ice storm. The product allows you to charge with a wall outlet or laptop.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The suspense was killing me to see how the packaging was going to be distributed...<br />I was pleasently suprized 3D cover of the three  and the overall packaging....<br />Awesome job and the movies were great with a soild trilogy...<br />Or is it a time to bring in robin ???
B00122RQKM|5.0|Of all the Genesis albums this 1 is by far my favorite, without Phil Collins no less..  As a matter fact this is the only Genesis mp3 that I own. Highly recommended!
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Todays porn wrapped up in a r rating. Disappointed in McConahey and Leo for even wanting to be part of this. The trailer makes it look like a good movie and there werer no terrible reviews and then the first five minutes of the movie I needed my eyes seered out. Full frontal female nudity in the opening of the movie. A woman who needed a bad trim walking around with no bottoms on and what was the camera focused on while she was talking even? I would want my money back and feel I need to be paid to even consider trash. A huge disappointment.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Could not stop turning the pages! Highly recommended / / / / / / / / / / / /
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love thr connectivity it gives me to old friends, new friends, and family. I love the political news and ideas and Information it provides.  I do not love the way it always changes format...
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is really fun but the money is a bit confusing but I guess that's just me. It is a way to just kill some time. I like multi tasking so this is just a easy to do so
B0091REZMW|3.0|its an ok game its slow but fun it is free I don't know why people said it wasn't free
B001W2D4XA|5.0|Tonight's the night is one of the three best Neil albums ever.  Along with on the beach and everybody knows this is nowhere this has anything and everything anyone and everyone that lives Neil is looking for.  He ventures into some exploratory ground and the sound is so funky and the lyrics so real.
0316228532|4.0|This is a book that needs time.  It is not that it starts slowly or is not interesting in the beginning, but it takes time to sort through all the characters and develop bonds with them.  Once you do, the book is hard to put down.  This is not something to read over a period of time...there are too many characters and plots to walk away from it for any length of time.  Do yourself a favor and give yourself a long weekend to totally immerse yourself in this novel and you will be greatly rewarded.<br /><br />That being said, it was a fantastic read.  This novel has the ability to run you through the gauntlet of emotions, all depending on what characters to relate to and align yourself with.  One page you feel triumphant and the next you are shocked and saddened.<br /><br />Having never read any of the Harry Potter books I had no idea what to expect, but I was not disappointed.  When I finished this I moved onto an Ann Patchett novel and 253 pages later I wish I were reading The Casual Vacancy again.
B001NOQI3U|4.0|The quality of the film was a little scratchy in parts but otherwise very good.  I am not sure about the extended cut since we didn't watch the original cut.
B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|I didn't enjoy reading this in college and I decided that now I was older I would have a better appreciation for the work. I know I'm &#34;supposed&#34; to love the classic literature of Jane Austen. I just really don't. This is one that is better in film IMHO.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|First, let me say this.<br /><br />I absolutely love Metallica.<br /><br />I turned 40 last year and I still listen to Metallica's first 4 albums with the same rabid enthusiasm I had when I was 14 years old and my best friend played his brand new \\"Master of Puppets\\" LP for me.<br /><br />The cracks started forming 5 years later in 1991.<br /><br />The \\"Black\\" album was good, I just wasn't on board with the newer \\"radio-friendly\\" sound. I begrudgingly accepted the lameness of \\"Unforgiven\\" because there were so many other worthwhile songs on that album.<br />Then, in 1996, \\"Load\\" was just that, A giant turd.<br />If they had done nothing more than release a single of \\"King Nothing\\" I'dve been happy. Unfortunately, it seemed like they just didn't respect their own music anymore and were just going through the motions.<br /><br />When the whole Napster fiasco came about, I really lost respect for the members of Metallica. They seemed to care less about making ear-splitting, mind-numbingly awesome music and more about making money. I took the whole thing like a giant middle finger to all their fans and gave up on everything new they did afterward.<br /><br />Until a few weeks ago that is...<br /><br />I resisted buying or even listening to this album for a LONG time (didn't buy it until 12.2012).<br />Several of my closest fellow metalhead friends raved about how this album was different from the last several, about how it was a return to what made the band great. So I swallowed my offended pride and condescended to give it a listen.<br /><br />I have to admit, with this album, I've gone through the same evolution I went through with the \\"Black\\" album.<br />After the first listen, I didn't like it. I couldn't put my finger on why though.<br />But I was determined to give it a fair chance and after several more listens, it was starting to grow on me. There were a lot of great riffs and it was hard to resist the temptation to do a little head banging.<br />Unfortunately, however, just as before with \\"Black\\" and everything since, the more I listen to \\"Death Magnetic\\" the more mediocre it seems to me.<br /><br />Is it worth buying? Sure. If you're considering it, you're obviously a fan and this album doesn't suck, it's just not as good as I initially thought or hoped. It's definitely not as good as it's been made out to be by so many others.<br /><br />If I had to rank it along with their other albums, I'd rank this one #6. Better than anything they've done since 1991 but still nowhere near what came before.<br /><br />Sadly, I guess I'll just have to crawl back under my rock and continue pretending like Metallica stopped putting out albums 20 years ago.<br /><br />The truth is, in my opinion, with the exception of a handful of tracks since, the first four albums are the only ones worth listening to and maybe... just maybe... Metallica should've gone their separate ways when Cliff died.owever, just as before with \\"Black\\" and everything since, the more I listen to \\"Death Magnetic\\" the more mediocre it seems to me.<br /><br />Is it worth buying?

B003VTZTU8|3.0|This is another book I would rather give 3.5 stars to. It's interesting and informative; however, it's a bit dry. I can only read a little at a time. Still, the subject is interesting.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A brilliantly concocted plot which kept me entertained on every page.  The main characters adventures with major world figures was beautifully done.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Such a great book. Historical fiction at it's best. The real events were blended so smoothly into the story as to be seamless. Captured me from the beginning and ran my emotions all over the board. Put this one on your 2013 reading list.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I have seen this movie several times over the years and am always amazed how much I enjoy it each time. Audrey Hepburn is fantastic in the title roll. I just finally had to add this to my collection.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a good game and I really enjoyed playing. The one flaw about this game is the food takes a long time to cook and its not free when you want more coins or gems so keep that in mind when downloading this game.
B0009VSB06|4.0|We have not used it yet but i think it will be good for what we will do with it.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|Love the movie and sound. Picture is pretty but grainy. Could be that is was shot in 70 mm but I think bluray is a bit overrated.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. I bought it for my mom for Christmas.. the thing I hated is how he can beat her back side.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the Christian Grey series. This book was a lot less risqué but well written. I would've liked a little more BDSM scenes but nonetheless I enjoyed the vanilla sex and romance.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I got really addicted to the game and then the game starts freezing after awhile and then it stops working all together.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love using this app for workouts. I find that having something timing me provides focus that I don't have when I workout on my own. The large library of exercises with added video clips to show how each exercise is done is very helpful and adds variety to otherwise stale workout routines. Very useful for people who don't have a ton of time and just need a good thirty minute workout squeezed in to a busy daily schedule. Definitely a recommended app.  There is also a free version available for those who prefer to try out an app before shelling out money, so check it out.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Incredible game with a large set of challenges for each plague. When I first saw this game i thought i<br />might as well give it a try.Ever since I got it i have always spent some time of the day playing. I suggest this for anyone who likes strategic kind of games.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew aged 17.  As soon as he opened it he gathered his cousins and brother and they went to my dining room table. They range in age from 11-17. His mother sent pictures to me later showing that it was a big hit at 2 different new Year's celebrations her sons attended as well. I need to buy it for my grandsons for their birthdays. They seemed to all be totally enthralled with the strategy and we were so grateful for a game that held their attention without monopolizing the tv area, no sound effects or screeching musical accompaniment! A great board game for all ages!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is good enough that four chapters in, I had fallen in love with Peeta and cried for Rue and Thresh.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|This book came highly recommended and, to say the least, it left me incredibly dissatisfied and disappointed. The plot was so basic and predictable I continued reading in the hope it might get better. It didn't. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|AWESOME! This book is about a secrets agent kid who must save the world from an evil organisation called Scorpia.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works like a charm and is fast like I have never had before on a wireless tablet device! If you want the best way to keep in touch this is it!
B0055S348W|1.0|Could not gat this app to work, and could find no way to cancel.  Hve just wiped it off my device and chalked the loss up to experience
B009738XXM|5.0|Fun songs and I love to listen while at work!  Great for the whole family.  Upbeat and fun songs here!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had the perfect touch of rebellion and love in all the right places. I couldn't put this book down!
B00A12VJZM|5.0|Awesome, defining retrospect of an iconic Rock Band. Listen to this and you'll understand why this band made Rock history.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It sucked. It was just a bad movie! I tried to like it but it had too much Seth McFarland all over it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is awesome because I love drawing stick people, but on this game you have to draw the adventure epicly (of course) . The reason I personally gave it a 5 star rating is because I think the author thought hard to make sure kids made their own people and draw their own stuff, but most importantly used their imagination.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game! Could have had more substance though. Game time was short. I could have played for many more hours.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  As long as you're not someone who is too &#34;mature&#34; to have fun, you will love this movie.  It is so funny, crude sometimes, but funny!
B005G5PPGS|3.0|I'm not a baseball nerd, just a nerd in general. I haven't seen the movie, and I know that seeing it after reading the book will make it more objective, enabling me to distinguish the intent of the writer vs the dramatic licenses movie directors always give themselves.<br />An interesting read, even for me, someone who stopped following baseball years ago. Puts things in perspective in a similar way Malcolm Gladwell 's books do.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This is one of those great horror films that never gets old.  It is so freaky and every time I watch it I get scared.
0679809015|4.0|I got this for the newest member of our family to start his book collection going. I was hoping for something a little bigger, but it will be great for travel.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|The first one was the funniest movie that I have seen in so long, this one was okay, but I was expecting so much more.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved it!  Can't wait for the next season to start!  If you've missed any of it this is a great way to catch up!
B004FV1ESW|4.0|Fast-paced, kept me interested, great actors, good story.  My Dad, my boyfriend, and me (33 year old female) all enjoyed it, so it must be good.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grishoms novels and have loved all of them.  Never disappointed.  I am reading the Racketeer now and am almost finished and all I can say is it is a page turner - hard to put down.<br /><br />A. Dougherty
B008DM4OTA|1.0|I downloaded this for my preschooler nephew and he lost interest in it in less than a minute.  I'm just glad it was free download that day.
B00ADYY7MA|4.0|I have only listened to this album once while in bed falling asleep so I didn't want to give it five stars as I didn't really hear it all!  But I'm sure if what I didn't hear is as good as what I DID hear, it would be a 5-star rating!  I love the music on the TV show so it's got to be great!
B007SGM084|4.0|I read this because of the hype and the first book, which was what all the hype was about was an S&M horrible book (unless you're into that).  I do not understand why women loved the first book - it was awful, really sexist, and made the woman lose her sense of self.  I didn't want to waste my $, so I kept reading and the next 2 books were so much better - they actually had real plots (aside from S&M) and were romantic and lovely.
B00ARAO720|2.0|I wasn't crazy about the ending. The antagonist was a horrible z-list actor; other than that, the movie was okay.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I could not wait to see this film and as soon as we left the theater, couldn't wait to find the soundtrack.  While it's moving, well recorded and a delightful addition for movie lovers, I found the soundtrack incomplete.  I was disappointed that \\"Lovely Ladies\\", \\" a Little fall of rain\\" and \\"Dawn of Anguish\\" were not included.  In the film, the young man playing Gavroche had such a powerful voice, I would have loved to have heard his songs.
B001EBYM62|5.0|It is a great picture and brings back great memories. I would recommend it to anyone who likes song and dance shows.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's an simple and fun game kind of addictive after a while very good way to kill some free time.
B004GJYRKA|4.0|It works perfectly, I may get more of these movies as gifts for friends and family members, who also love bruce lee, so better stock up
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I bought this for our son. It only took a few days to get here. The seller was quick in shipping and protecting it in shipment. Our son Loves this far better than the PG-13 version. He said it has a lot more war seens and action in it, plus it comes with 3 other discs, a book and some other memorabilia that makes the set all worth it. I tried to buy it from Best Buy but they were out of stock and besides, they wanted 32.00 for the same thing. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to see the movie to date about Pearl Harbor.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The latest installment in the Harry Bosch noels did not disappoint! I love Harry and his quirky ways. I did feel that the end was wrapped up rather quickly. But it was still right on the money with the other Connelly novels.
0972169504|5.0|Our son is working on his PhD so this made for some great reading to see a little of what his life is like.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun time waste it works best at the dmv when you really just want to curl up and cry from boredom
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Rarely do I write a review but this one, well, it took my breath away.  This was the first time I've read one of her books and  I want more!  Hope her other books are as good as this one was.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just a android solitare game cheap free i guess get it if you need a solitare game on the phone
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|The game is frustrating. After completing the second level it returns you to do the second level all over again with no changes in the level. Why? I stopped there. If I do the second level again and it brings me right back there a third time I will come back and give this app one star!  My five inch display is too small to draw the tiny figures that this game wants you to draw to play - including the stick figures. It would be impossible to play this on a smaller screen. I also tried drawing with a stylus and could not get a decent figure drawn - much less the tools, etc. that you must draw as you play.  Perhaps a ten inch tablet is what the designer intended this game for. The puzzles are not easy - this is not a game for younger children. If you have a large screen and very tiny fingers to draw and you like puzzles that have no obvious solutions, you might like this game. I do not and I am glad that I got it as the FAOTD and did not pay for it. It will be deleted.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is just a classic movie I enjoy watching. The blu-ray makes the scenery at the beginning of the movie just spectacular! I haven't had a chance to view all the extras but I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />I bought this as a Christmas gift to myself because it was on sale; I waited to open it until Christmas Day. All the extras inside the box were great! The books complement the movie and the whole box just has a special feel when you open it.  Definitely a great buy!
B001AQR3IU|5.0|It is amazing that this movie came out five years ago and I don't believe I ever heard of it.  For those of you who like adventurous love stories, this is a good movie.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays the evil witch, Robert De Niro plays the captain with a fearsome reputation, Charlie Cox is the young man trying to win the girl of his dreams, and the absolutely beautiful Claire Danes plays Yvaine, a fallen star.  I don't want to spoil the story, just watch it.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Well-written, and perfectly cast.  This compelling series tells the stories of the gentry &#34;upstairs&#34; and the staff &#34;downstairs&#34; and how the lives of the principal characters of each are interwoven. So glad my daughter introduced me to this show!
0071762345|5.0|I have been involved in social media for some years, but decided to give this book a read after stumbling upon Likeable Media on Facebook.  Whether you are a beginner looking to get into social media for your organization or an experienced marketer seeking a leg up, this book will give you what you are looking for.  Kerpen uses fun language and tons of real world examples to make the book easy to follow.
0756933935|5.0|i like the printing quality of this book. i used to read the kindle version. i love the novel so much. so i have to get the hard cover book to make it one of my collection.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Keeps me amused for hours. Now I have more than 100 new puzzles to do, even has Christmas backgrounds and music.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book keeps you on the edge!  So much drama and twists. Can't wait for the next book to be released!!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|An absolutely wonderful story about the adventures and mis-adventures of Santa and his family and helpers on a cold Christmas Eve night.  The animation is quite nice, the characters are believable. This story will enter the company of Dr Suess' Grinch and Frosty et al.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 12 year old son and I really enjoy playing Flow together, switching back and forth after every five puzzles.  We time ourselves too.  Great app for challenging a bright young mind.
B001DJ7PQ4|2.0|I am an avid fan but when I purchase something I expect to get the real thing, not a bad reproduction with all kinds of typos, incorrect titles. Contacted the seller and was very happy with the end result but not from the original person he didn't seem to care. I had to repurchase them so now I am happy.
B003B02O14|3.0|Grisham is GREAT on story telling but weak on character development. They do make good airport and airplane reading though. Fast and forgettable.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I am always happy when I get another Doctor video, the price was great. I was upset because didn't realize it was 2 day shipping. Would always recommend these. Can't wait to get the sixth one.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|While reading I felt like the story was so predictable yet I was constantly being surprised and couldn't put it down!
0061733199|5.0|This is a great survival handbook.  I've reviewed several similar handbooks before, but none of them compare to this survival handbook.  It describes situations and survival techniques you can apply nearly anywhere.  I especially liked the detailed instructions for starting a fire from ice.  Check it out!  A perfect manual to have in your 'emergency&#34; pack, and another in your car, &#34;just in case.&#34;
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a great book if you like video games and grew up in the 80′s.  Basically it is the future and of course it is a total mess, in fact things are so bad people would rather spend their day playing a game rather than live in the real world.  But OASIS is more than just a game it is VR to the next level with full immersion  everything we wanted the Lawn Mower Man to be but it wasn’t!  Schools, jobs, relationships, vacations, and just about everything is based here in this video game.  The creator of the game dies in the beginning and offers a huge reward of $250 Billion dollars and the title of owner of GSS systems which runs OASIS.  So you just have to find the Easter egg in the game and you win.  So everyone’s sole mission in life is to find this egg and become rich.  Of course the owner of the company was obsessed with the 80′s so everyone studies it hoping they will find the secrets to the game to win the main prize!<br /><br />This book fallows the adventures of 5 Gunters (full time OASIS Egg Hunters) and their battle against the Sixers who own a competing company that want to win the competition so they can turn OASIS into a business model rather than the free entertainment and education program it is today.<br /><br />The 80′s pop culture references are amazing here.  The main character Wade’s log in to the system is the theme lines to The Last Starfigher!  I highly recommend this book and you will have a hard time putting this one down as well!
B008SMURG4|4.0|Kyla L.<br />Good price for this set. The panels are a little difficult to get into place. They don't snap in, instead they are held in place by tension. Once in place though they do add extra support for making bigger things. This is a good add on set, but it wouldn't be much fun on it's own. My 7 year old loves these, and so do I.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|We needed to add to our Halloween collection of movies and this is a must have.  The best part is the zombie survival list, we were skeptical the first time we watched it but fell in love with it quickly.
0205313426|5.0|The Elements of Style book arrived as requested.  excellent condition, great price!  thank you so much!  brand new and perfect!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I heard about this series about a week before I saw the movie preview, thanks to my mom.  She mentioned that Tom Cruise would be a horrible cast for this role and after reading the first book I would agree.  Jack Reacher is tall, thick, rough around the edges and fresh out of the Military Police in the Army.  Not the images I have when I think of Tom Cruise.  Anyways, this was a great read and moved along super fast.  Essentially Jack is a nomad traveling around the US after he is honorably discharged from the Army.  He ends up making a bus stop at this little town outside Atlanta Georgia because he remembers a story about a singer that his brother told him about from that town.  The town is 14 miles away from the highway and has sort of been forgotten.  While in this town Jack is arrested during breakfast for a murder he obviously didn’t commit.  He then finds out there is a whole lot more going on in this little town then he thought and wishes he never stepped off the bus in the first place.<br /><br />There are something like 19 books in the Jack Reacher series and it has made my short list of quick books to read that are action packed and written well.  I did enjoy the character development and had no problem visualizing in my mind what was happening in the story.  I also love Jack’s attitude it’s great.  Highly recommend this series for anyone who likes Dirk Pitt, Isaac Bell, Tyler Lock,  or any other of the action based series that Clive Cussler or  Jeremy Robinson has become known for.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love love loved this book. I have lost many hours of sleep because I could not put it down. I read it in four days. I laughed, I cried, I felt every word. This book is a must read!!!!!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The way it is written was a little different, essentially it is written from a journalist point of view of the war with the zombies.  So he goes around all over the world and interviews people before, during, and after the war to get the best idea of what it was like.  This book takes a serious (as much as it can be) look at what a war with zombies would be like.  It does bring up some good points like zombies don’t need food, weapons, leadership, clothes, tools and the only way you can kill them is to destroy the brain.  So our typical books of warfare don’t apply here because there are no supply lines to cut or generals to assassinate and they have no problem recruiting or getting new members. It goes through and talks about all of our weapons work to kill only living people not the walking dead.  This is because to kill the walking dead you need weapons of precision and a lot of our weapons of mass destruction just cause a lot of damage and kill people by bleeding out or something and that doesn’t work for zombies.  Plus when we lose a battle to the zombies their numbers get bigger while our keep dwindling<br /><br />A good read and a little different, don’t know if it’s on my must read list but I wouldn’t tell anyone to not read it.  Interested to see how the movie works out with all the stories they had in this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Handy it doe's what it is suppose to do. BOTHER AND SISTER PEOPLE it is good.  SINCE AT 69 years of age math is lost in my mind this saves me problems every day. I can see the large numbers also!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|So after a slew of bad books, that I didn’t finish, this was the first one I couldn’t put down and almost finished on a single round trip to Texas.  This is a great book and goes to show you ideas like what LOST tried to do can actually work if you close out the story and give it some context.  The story line here is a Secret Service agent is in a car accident in a small perfect town called Wayward Pines.  He awakes to find himself bruised from the crash but is having troubles remembering what happened or how he ended up there.  He continues to investigate the town and try and find out what is happening but things are not right and he soon finds himself in more trouble then he should be.<br /><br />Loved this book and highly recommend it.  Great writing and very hard to put down, it’s frustrating to read because you want answers and they eventually come out in the end and in a good way.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I found myself really relating to the main character of this book, except for the twist at the end. It was a great book with an unusual style of writing through letters. I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I read it in one day.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Actually my wife was the one who suggested this book after watching the show Stars and Stripes and hearing about this guy.  This book talks about Chris Kyle going through the Navy and becoming a SEAL then becoming a sniper.  It was interesting to read, for once, about a war that I have been alive to know about.  Although the book talks about places like Fallujah, Ramadi, and Sadr City of which I have only heard of one of the three.  This story is amazing and brings great realism to war and what it is like to be in it as well as come home.  Chris’s wife contributes to the book about her point of view with 2 children while Chris went on 4 deployments to the Middle East.  I am very humbled by this reading and amazed and think Chris would be an awesome person to meet in real life.<br /><br />Some chapters and things he mentions in this book left me with my mouth wide open and just shaking my head about how removed 95% of Americans were from how bad it was over there.  Also about how most of us take for granted the loyalty and dedication our armed services have. The stories about his friends which became his family while he was deployed was great.  Really gave a face to the soldiers that have fought our wars.  I had no idea really what a SEAL team did other than the occasional bad ass movie! It was interesting to hear how they tend to work across multiple armed services (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force).<br /><br />Highly recommend this reading for anyone and chances are you will never watch another SEAL movie the same way again.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|If you are a fan of Supertramp, this is a must have. I have been a big fan of Supertramp since 1974. Have seen them a few times in concert between 1974 and 1979, and their performances were always amazing. This DVD brings those great moments back to life.  They were always such a tight band and you see all this amazing talent shown at this Live Concert in Paris. This period of time was very special for Supertramp, they had already gained stardom, but were very down to earth and grounded, and really wanted to please their fans with their performances as always. This was a really special tour and this special night in Paris was something to behold.<br />All the songs they picked for this show are gems, the sound on the DVD is great.<br />The video is a bit grainy, but what do you expect from tape footage from 1979.  However they did a great job with the video on this DVD and their are great angle shots as well.<br />This will be a DVD that you will enjoy playing again and again.<br />Do Not miss out on this DVD!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you in. Interesting plot and great love story. Emotional swirl and fairy tale ending. Can't wait to read book two.

0316077046|4.0|If you are familiar with this series, then you know it is told from Ethan's point of view. I am almost always a fan of YA books with a male narrator, since there doesn't seem to be enough of them out there. The Caster Chronicles is unique because it's a paranormal romance/mystery that is told from the boy's perspective. Not your typical teen boy book, in my opinion.<br /><br />This time around in book 2, Ethan actually sounds like a boy. He does digress from time to time and starts sounding like an over emotional girl when he pines away for Lena, but at least he is showing typical boy emotions now. He ran the spectrum from anger to jealousy to lust. That is much more believable than a boy describing how hair smells and his feelings.<br /><br />The plot continues to develop in this series. It's rather complicated at times and a bit drawn out. Each of these books come in at just over 500 pages. That's a lot of words! The size of the books may scare off a few readers, but know that around page 300 or so the story does start to move rather quickly. You just have to make it that far.<br /><br />Also along the way are new characters and repeats from Beautiful Creatures. New super villians are introduced and some are redeemed. Or are they? (dun dun dun) I have to admit, Link's interesting situation has me intrigued, but that will have to wait until book 3 (Beautiful Chaos) to be confirmed. Ethan continues to grow, and now has a new understanding of his place in The Order. Good for him. Lena is still Lena: confused, stubborn, overly dramatic. She wasn't in the majority of the book--except as glimpses in Ethan's visions-- so it seemed rather rushed that her outcome developed the way it did and had so much emphasis in the final 30 pages. Whatever. I knew what was going to happen there long before I reached the end of the book.<br /><br />Finally, I want to mention that the southern characters didn't seem as ignorant this time around. The small town folks were limited, with the main emphasis being on Ethan and his motley crew of Dark Caster fighters. That helps with the level of stupid for sure. I also want to go ahead and mention my thoughts on the upcoming movie since that's why I'm reading these now. I am not happy with the casting and the cheesy Southern accents. Am I the only one that pictured Ethan differently and didn't think Lena or Macon had southern accents? I also didn't imagine Ethan with one either. Tacky. And what is up with Lena's eyes? With all the emphasis on green and gold (and her ever changing colors), why does she have brown eyes? Hmm??<br /><br />Anyhow, if you enjoy this series, have a go at book 2: Beautiful Darkness. I'm one of those people that has to read the entire series before a movie adaptation hits the big screens because I want to know how badly they muck things up (or not) in the movie. So, I will be continuing with Beautiful Chaos.e main emphasis being on Ethan and his motley crew of Dark Caster fighters. That helps with the level of stupid for sure.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very enjoyable and addictive game and it comes at a great price, too....FREE!!! Try it, you'll like it. Once you start playing you won't be able to put it down.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Being a HUGE Pride & Prejudice fan since I was a small child, and having watched this film literally a hundred times (it got me through college and long nights of unbearable studying and roommate drama), I decided to buy the blu-ray version for my mom for Christmas - since this is our \\"bonding\\" movie. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch this on regular DVD ever again. The digitally remastered, HD gorgeousness that is this film is just eye-opening in so many ways. My mom and I spent the entire time just commenting on all the intricate details of the clothing and the setting that we had totally missed before.<br /><br />As for the actual film itself - in my humble opinion, this is the superior rendition of one of Jane Austen's most beloved stories. The acting is superior, the characters and story are more fleshed out, it's more \\"accurate\\" to the period detail wise than the newest version... it's easily one of the best book-to-film adaptions I've ever seen. Ehle is the best Elizabeth Bennet I've come across - she can be flirtatious and witty without coming across b*tch like, which is fantastic to behold.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE this miniseries and totally recommend the blu-ray version to anyone and everyone who already loves it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great acting , spectacular scenery and wonderfully authentic period costumes. You really felt for the characters, although there are so many, it took a little while to get to know them. Couldn't stop watching.
0545265355|5.0|This series, I swear... Look, I'll admit. I'm a late comer to the Hunger Games series, but despite the hype (that made me hesitant to read it in the first place) this series is actually very good. Third book was a tad on the disappointing side, and this is DEFINITELY (in my opinion) not meant for the kids that have been obsessing over it, but it's enjoyable and even thought-provoking at times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely adore this app. Its one of the most addictive games ever! Once I start playing it, its soooooooo hard to stop!!!!! I recomend this game to everyone!!
1402238843|5.0|one of my ALL-TIME favorite Heyer books. Got this for a friend who has been listening to me rave about Georgette Heyer for years and now she finally understands what I've been talking about. You can't go wrong with this woman! She is fabulous!
B0040JHL18|3.0|nice looking shoes.  got them to help my plantar fasciitis.  comfortable BUT they squeak when I walk.  I hate that!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|this show is a guilty pleasure for me, so of course I'm going to give it a rave review! Actually, all things considered, this show is very well done. Granted, it can get a bit cliched and frustrating at times, but it keeps my attention and drags me in every week there's a new episode. The cast is fantastic and this is one of the few instances that I can say the &#34;movie&#34; (or in this case, show) is better than the book.

B009VLX8FS|4.0|First things first, I don't understand why Taylor Swift keeps insisting that she's country because this album sounds anything BUT country (unless this is the direction country is taking); but that picky-ness aside, this album actually grew on me the more I listened to it. My first listen, I was actually disappointed with the new sound and direction Swift was taking but having listened to it several times through now, I actually appreciate the growth she's undergone and the chances she's taken, because most of the time, they totally pay off.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|This novel makes me dream about technology that sounds impossible for current standards but that does not sound completely impossible and how humans at the end become... well... better read it.<br /><br />Totally recommened

Yes, it is totally worth to buy it even if you have already seen the tv series.<br />The paper quality is.. according to the price it cost. the finishing is very reliable. The box came with a few dents, nothing terrible. Highly recommendable if you want to read the story and are low on cash :D

B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper is a Science Fiction gem. Writer/Director Rian Jonson's personal passion project possesses one of the rarest traits in today's film industry, originality (apologies for all the p's). I really liked Looper a lot when I first saw it in the theater, and I loved it the second time at home. I loved it because it drew me in. Not only the story itself, or the plethora of rich characters, but also the dark dystopian future world that Johnson created. I totally bought into everything I saw, and it made the story feel more personal to me.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite young actors working. He brings a charisma, and a maturity to the screen every time. He's uniquely great here because of the Bruce Willis impression he is trying to pull off, meanwhile still adding a personal touch to his younger version of the character that he and Bruce share. Not only are they great, but also the supporting cast which consists of Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, Emily Blunt, Noah Segan and great kid named Pierce Gagnon who does one of the most intense creepy looks. He's truly a good find for the role he plays.<br /><br />I will avoid any sort of plot description, because one of the greatest parts of the film is discovering everything as the plot unfolds. What I will say that the film is complex without being complicated. It's nice to be able to think and analyze while watching a modern Sci-Fi flick. That's not as common as it used to be. As for the Blu-ray treatment, it's top notch.<br /><br />The disc is practically reference material. The picture quality is sublime. Detail is sharp, and colors are rich. The audio definitely is, it's sonic. The sound design is sure to rumble some home theaters. As for the extras, they are pretty good as well. I am a sucker for commentaries, especially on personal projects like this. Johnson delivers a fascinating commentary during both the film and the deleted/extended scenes.<br /><br />The featurettes are fairly short, which is the biggest drawback, but there should be enough here to satisfy most who even bother to venture into the special features section of the disc. I do not have much else to say about this film, because my gushing over how great the film is would probably grow tiresome, but I can't recommend it enough. Quite simply, Looper is an original time-travel thriller with heart. Must Own.iggest drawback, but there should be enough here to satisfy most who even bother to venture into the special features section of the disc.

B0091THRCU|3.0|I ordered this case thing about a week after getting the 5 and really loved it at first. (2 WEEKS OR SO)<br /><br />I thought it was a pretty 'nifty' little carrier until I started noticing strange scratches on my phone screen/back. They weren't long drags or anything, but more like imprints that weren't going away. Thankfully I have the the zagg screen protector on my phone so no permanent damage was caused. I also disliked that you could fit one card and ONE card only in the little pocket. Anything past a credit card/id and a bill was out of the question. Also just recently I noticed the threads coming loose.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to a friend... I'd give them mine :p

B001EZ2T7W|4.0|I normally do not watch Stargate shows.  We had guests over that wanted to watch it and we obliged.  The show was a good science fiction and I would watch others.  I do think this series should be watched in order so that there is continuity to the plots and characters are developed in a chronological order.

Does not work for me at all.  In trying to write it is not consistent and you end up with portions of your writing.  Seems you must press straight down and very firmly which does not lend well to my writing style.  Sticking with Wacom's Bamboo and just ordered some replacement FIRM nibs -- maybe I just wore mine out ;-)<br /><br />I like the size and feel of this stylus but it just does not work for me at all.

I just love it. It's a hardcover, old-style bound in brown fabric, with a neat hologram on the cover. The pages are thick and luxurious with a tonne of full-page photographs, and couple of very insightful and interesting interviews with the people who were closest to him, giving a peek into the prodigy that was Alexander McQueen.

0312360258|3.0|Enter the dark, magical world of the House of Night. A world very much like our own, except here vampyres have always existed. Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird has just been Marked as a fledgling vampyre and joins the House of Night, a school where she will train to become an adult vampyre. That is, if she makes it through the Change--and not all of those who are Marked do. It sucks to begin a new life, especially away from her friends, and on top of that, Zoey is no average fledgling. She has been chosen as special by the vampyre Goddess Nyx. Zoey discovers she has amazing powers, but along with her powers come bloodlust and an unfortunate ability to Imprint her human ex-boyfriend. To add to her stress, she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers: When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite group, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny-with a little help from her new vampyre friends.<br /><br />  I have seen several negative reviews about this book. I have to say that is not what I am doing. This book was a little slow at the begining, but turning out I fell in love with the main characters. The story is an unusual begining for a vamp series, and I am very intrigued. Great descriptions, love the humor, loved how easy it was to read.<br /><br />  \\" \\"Zoey Montgomery! Night has chosen thee; thy death will be thy birth. Night calls to thee; hearken to Her sweet voice. Your destiny awaits you at the House of Night!\\"...........He lifted one long, white finger and pointed at me. As my forehead exploded in pain Kayla opened her mouth and screamed....\\"
B007N5YIUS|3.0|very popular game, well taken for all ages and good to kill time with, recommended it a lot and for all ages
1416955070|5.0|When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder--much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tatttoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing--not even a smear of blood--to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?<br /><br />  This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...<br /><br />  A must read!!! Such an original story, I am in love!! Clary and her adventures throughout this book is so addictive! Cassandra Clare did a fantastic job at creating a new line of  \\"super-heros\\" per say. I was addicted from the first page and it was extremely hard to put it down. So I kept it with me and now I have to move on to book two!!!!!! Excellent!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|can use some improvment for the graphics, otherwise this will be a great game to play, need more choices as well
B0053O89XI|5.0|All I can say is Blooper reel! Worth getting if you're a BBT fanatic. Prefer the Blurays for the features and would make a great present as such an affordable price.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|if you like animals, this is not the game for you, if you hate pigs, this is also not the game for you
0316069434|5.0|Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down. When I received the book, it looked brand new...as though it had never been touched. I recommend the book to everyone who enjoys reading Michael Connelly books.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a wonderful game, but I do wish that you could move up in levels easier. Overall its coolio.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Since I read it on the Kindle app, I guess we have to call it a \\"page-tapper,\\" but however you phrase it, this is one of those fast-paced John Grisham stories that is hard to put down. Some familiar plot devices are present, in particular the delight of having tons of money to be wired to off-shore accounts. A double-double cross, a bit of romance, revenge, murder, wrongful arrests, and a wonderful treasure hidden in obscure brand cigar boxes provide the ingredients for the kind of adventure we expect from Grisham.<br /><br />I went through a period of disoriented confusion when the protagonist started searching for Nathan Cooley, whose name had not been mentioned previously, but it's all explained in the end, so just keep reading and enjoy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I don't usually enjoy hidden object games on my Kindle Fire HD, but decided to give this one a try.  I'm glad I did.  Playing the free version lets you get about halfway through, but I wanted to see how it ended and bought the full version.  This game is engaging, and the hidden object scenes are very nicely done.  No problems with objects being too small, but has the option of zooming in.  I only used it a few times.  I'll be playing this one again, maybe on higher difficulty than casual.  No crashes, and it looks great!  Thank you for getting it right!
0385536828|5.0|I found this novel to be interesting on many levels -- engaging plot with unexpected twist at the end, interesting characters who keep secrets from each other while trusting the wrong people, neatly summarized short stories embedded within the story and used to move it forward, commentary on historical, cultural and political developments in the UK during the 1970's, commentary on writers and writing.  The plot kept me reading, and the ending made me go back and re-read to find the clues that were planted throughout.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's Facebook on my phone, not much more to say. It works but I don't really use it too much.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|How they can top this season is beyond me!  John Lithgow as a murderer almost as depraved as Dexter makes for a season that simply can't be topped.  Mr. Lithgow manages to raise the performance of an already stellar cast to mythic levels.  Never having missed and episode, I consider myself a fan but this season is the only one I own for the simple reason that TV just doesn't get any better then this!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Love to have this movie to watch with my family and pass down to them. I the movie is full of wonderment.
B005LAII0I|3.0|A contemporary spin on a familiar tale and a glib sense of humor make MIRROR MIRROR an entertaining film.  Julia Roberts plays the Wicked Queen with a devilish cynicism and narcissistic flourish.  Lily Collins is both demure and flirtatious as Snow White and Armie Hammer is a fine Prince.  Nathan Lane is delightful as the Queen's bumbling aide and Mare Winningham is fun as the baker lady.  All of the seven dwarves/bandits are perfectly cast, each having distinctive persomalities.  The movie is visually impressive, capturing a mystical fairy tale landscape.  My main complaint is the movie's over use of lengthy sword fights, which seemed to serve as padding.<br />Overall, MIRROR MIRROR is a fun diversion with a wide appeal.
B001AW156U|1.0|they popped off in the first 5 minutes of playing.  if you dont squeeze the controller they wont break.  but if you dont buy it it wont break either.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved seeing the film in the theater when it first came out. I knew that I would purchase it once it was released on dvd to view over the years to come. I loved loved the music and when the cd was released did purchase it immediately. Loved listening to it on my garden patio all summer long as the music was very special as well. A wonderful funny,sad and touching film. Stellar cast,a real &#34;feel good&#34; film that I will now enjoy for many years to come.

B00846REIS|1.0|This book had some great sex .... but thats about it! Sylvia Day stole somr ideas from E.L. James. Book irritated me more than anything else. NO originality at all.
0670026182|4.0|...The food looks delicious!<br /><br />I did not give 5 stars because for ME the text layout is difficult to read in some places.<br /><br />The book seems to be more a \\"lifestyle\\" book rather than a comprehensive instructional reference cookbook, which I can appreciate.  It makes me want to cook and is inspirational in that many of the recipes seem to be conducive to improvising and customizing.<br /><br />MOST important to me though is do the recipes work?  I just purchased the book yesterday and have not had the opportunity to cook from it.  If the recipes taste as the pictures look it will be a winner!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this one!  Shows Ana and Christian as grown ups!  Love the marriage theme and how they navigate through.  My favorite of the series.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|My son wanted this DVD for Christmas and was very happy when he got it. I myself think that it was the best of the trilogy. DVD got to me just in time for Christmas. I give seller A++++++
B007W7P5L8|2.0|It is purple the color I chose but, it is not the stand I was expecting.  I see no way to bend it. And nothing to catch it on if it did bend.
0765326353|5.0|I think Brandon Sanderson is one of the greatest fantasy writers of all time.  I can't wait for him to write another Stormlight book.  It's a pity he started working on the Wheel of Time series because that series is sooo boring compared to Sandersons typical work.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|My 7 year old son and I love this game. It is hard to put down. I have not been able to sign in and visit friends, this has been annoying.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I love Whitney Houston, she was a true gift to music, sad what happened. That being said, if you love Whitney you will want this cd. I found it to be more complete then the 2007 release of her Greatest Hits. The 2007UK import  one disc Ultimate Collection has all the real hits on one cd and none of the remix stuff that is crammed onto the 2007 US release of her Greatest Hits. To be fair though the 2007 US release of her greatest hits does have one thing the Ultimate Collection does not. That is Whitney singing the Star Spangled Banner. If you want that and it's no remix, you will need to buy the 2007 US release of the Greatest Hits.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is perfect for school I highly recommend this app. plus its free! this makes my classes easier and notes are easier to take!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the book. However, be prepared for depression city. It's beyond sad and deep. If you want an easy good feeling read this is not it. It's a good story line and the characters are well developed.
B003WKFABY|3.0|I consider myself a Yes fan, and I'll concede the fact that this is as much a Yes album as any of the Yes West albums are Yes albums.  I'll add that I have the studio CD of ABWH, and enjoy listening to that.  Overall, this CD has some aspects going for it that merit mentioning.  The quality of the recording is very good, among the best that Yes has mustered over the years.  The choice of tracks is also good quality, everything from Close to the Edge to solo efforts from Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson, to AWBH vintage.<br /><br />I was unable to, however, give this higher than a 3 star rating.  There are two reasons why.  The first is Bill Bruford, and the second is Chris Squire, or more specifically, the lack thereof.  First, Bill Bruford.  There's no doubt that he is a good drummer, and did a fine job on the first few Yes albums.  One can hear quite clearly that he has improved a great deal compared to those years, based on his performance on this album.  Unfortunately, he chose to use electronic drums, which in parts, I found extremely annoying.  There a section in Long Distance Runaround, about 3:18 into the track, when they do a slice from Heart of the Sunrise.  His snare drum (or at least I think it's a snare drum) just sounds silly, almost like machine gun fire.  Now, I've got nothing against machine gun fire, but I do like it separate from my music listening.  This snare drum sound occurs in numerous sections on several tracks, and it makes it almost unlistenable.  It's a shame because Close to the Edge is nicely done for the most part, except for the drumming, which again, to this listener, is almost unlistenable.<br /><br />On to the bass.  To me, a big part of the Yes sound is the bass.  Chris Squire's unique sound and style contribute in large part to Yes.  And the lack of that contribution is hopelessly apparent.  On top of that, the bass is buried completely under the mix, almost as if it were done on purpose.  The few time I can hear the bass, it sound fine.  Jeff Berlin obviously knows how to play well, but I really wish I could hear him better.  And the addition of another keyboard player and guitarist only serves to bury the bass deeper behind the mix.  And while the background vocals are competent, again, Chris Squire's unique blend with Jon Anderson is sorely missed.<br /><br />Overall, if one can get past the electronic drums and lack of bass, this is a good album.  But not one of Yes' best.s, it sound fine.  Jeff Berlin obviously knows how to play well, but I really wish I could hear him better.  And the addition of another keyboard player and guitarist only serves to bury the bass deeper behind the mix.  And while the background vocals are competent, again, Chris Squire's unique blend with Jon Anderson is sorely missed.<br /><br />Overall, if one can get past the electronic drums and lack of bass, this is a good album.  But not one of Yes' best.
B002722R64|2.0|Movie - Good<br />Quality of HD video =  awful!!! I do want a refund, but I was not able to find where to as for it. Quality was worst that VHS.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|I was really expecting a re-hash of a Glee episode, but this one surprised me - my 15 year old theatre kid loved it as well.  My only complaint was the HD version I downloaded did not come in with Dolby Digital sound through my surround sound system.  Any ideas as to why it only came in as stereo?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|One of the better point and click adventures. Interesting concept and excellent graphics. There were some false hints, ie kept pointing at the safe when there was nothing to do there, but just go elsewhere and it works out.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Just wish I would've watched it before the hype. I enjoyed it but was mildly underwhelmed due to the amount of hype it received.
0784011710|5.0|A powerful story and portrayal of mental illness and its' victims, both the afflicted and people intertwined in their lives. My motivation for reading the book and later viewing the movie was to better understand the wounds of genocide and discrimination. The history was my priority but quickly learned the lasting effect of traumatic events on the mental health of all affected.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|When I first saw this series (the first 3 books) at B&N's I suspected that it would somehow connect to Harry Potter and his way of magic.  After all, Nicholas Flamel is the wizard who owned the Sorcerer's Stone in book 1.  So I was expecting Flamel to have a wand just like how Harry and his magical peeps have.<br /><br />But as I've started reading this, it's perfectly clear that Nicholas Flamel doesn't hail from Harry's world.  For one, they don't have wands.  The other dead give away was that Flamel lives in San Francisco, Ca.  Not England.<br /><br />I like this story though.  It's quite intriguing.
B00633W614|5.0|i LOVED THIS BOOK, i WAS WONDERING IF THE STORY CONTINUES. i RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. GREAT .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I luv this app and my lil brother luvs playing it 2. I bearly learned how to play it 3 days ago!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|This case arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It is attractive and fits well with the Kindle Fire. My only complaint is that the stand is a little wobbly, but I normally don't use it for that, so as a basic cover it works fine.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I found this app was not for me. It _took_ from the Facebook experience as it did not resemble 'browser' Facebook at all. Too limited in scope. As a newbie tablet user, I was dismayed by the fact that seemingly all apps desire to take over every aspect of your device, and add to and delete from storage and SD chip, your phone habits, location and other privacies. This app took it further, demanding that it be allowed to record both live audio and video from cameras and microphone. There is no one but me and my wife and family need to know that much information. I know  I may be in error or misread it all, but that's the way I see it.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|I really enjoyed seasons 1-3 of Lost and then once I got to season 4, I started losing track of what was happening; things got really confusing, and they never explain any of it!! That being said, there's still a lot of great action and suspense that carries you through to the end.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read. Maybe not the best in the series but I enjoyed it. It is worth the time reading it.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|It worked fine. My daughter was finally able to connect her I-phone to the dock while it is in it's Otterbox
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I got app when it was free. Now that I have played it I would definitely have paid the five bucks for it. Would suggest that if you play it you will know the true meaning of OCD. I can't put it down, so I'm having trouble Keeoing my phone charged.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wonderful game. It has enveloped my children since they downloaded it to their Kindles. Building is a big part of it from what I have seen while my children are playing this game.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I was waiting for this one for a long time and glad I did. It's amazing that she has accumulated so many hits in such a short time. She is one of the greatest artists of our time and will be looking forward to Volume 2.
B009AHWLHE|4.0|I think this animated movie is better than the previous animated resident evil movie &#34;Degeneration&#34;.  If you liked R.E. Degeneration you must go se this one!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was simple and easy to read.  It does have some homosexual aspects to it, but it was just mentioned briefly.. The reason I titled this buyer beware is that this book ends in a cliff hanger.. It left me wondering what is going to happen next.  The good news is that the next book should be out at the end of January according to her face book page.<br /><br />So if you looking for a good read for a rainy or cold day.  I would recommend this book.  I finished it in one setting which is rare for me.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie great actor great special effects! I want to hang out with all these guys even Hulk;)!<br />What more needs to be said? Except if you haven't seen this yet GET THIS DISC AND SEE IT!!!!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Super sexy voice (in my opinion) and incredible debut album.  Not one song on here that I don't enjoy.  Best of luck to you Phillip!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I recently received it and it didn't work properly. Both joysticks fell out so i tossed it. Very unimpressed. :(
B008B3GP2A|5.0|And Adam Levine.  Many great songs on this album, nice to hear the variety in Adams voice and style. Love!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Was really enjoying the especially since it was &quot;free&quot; . Should be noted though,  after a short play through it turns out this game is not &quot;free &quot;, but I do think it's worth the 2.99 . Perhaps though a heads up would be nice. Just saying.
0060589280|3.0|I guess I just don't &#34;get&#34; Paulo Coelho's books.  This was recommended to me by a friend. I tried to read The Alchemist and just couldn't get through it.  Eleven Minutes was a descriptive read with a fairly unique storyline: a young country woman is attracted to adventure in the &#34;big city&#34; and is drawn into prostitution.  The main character is somewhat annoying: she has an attitude and considers herself quite worldly for someone who had never left the town she was born in until she leaves for the Big City. She has many justifications for her new profession. But her haughty persona does not make her particularly likeable. And some of the story line and her train of thought was laugh-out-loud ridiculous in places. I think some of the storyline seemed to be lost in translation along the way: simplified and dumbed down but because of that the original meaning was lost along the way. I read the book, liked it up to a certain point, but I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone else. I could see where it would be recommended reading for a bookclub or and English Literature course but if you are looking for an engaging, fun, light read this is NOT it.
B0038ZITHK|5.0|Its of a very good quality, you would thing its a new copy of the movie. The quality of the picture is fantastic
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent, as to be expected from Nelson DeMille. He never fails to deliver interesting and exciting page turners. More than worthy buy and read.
B001O1O71C|5.0|One of the nest books I have ever read in my entire life. You can never predict what is going to happen next.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|A great book well worth reading. Cornwell once again delivers a well written story covering only a few days of time, which is a nice change.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This Diary of a wimpy kid was pretty funny but it was not what I thought it would be. I mean I thought that it would be really, really funny like the other books. In the beginning I thought that I would have been laughing like all of the other books in the series.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Little one goes crazy over this. I rented it so many times I had to buy it. Lesson learned. We're waiting for the second one coming up soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just could not put it down!<br />You must read it!!!<br />I'm about to start catching fire!<br />Even though I've read all three books...
B001T6PXFG|5.0|Exciting, inspiring, based in a true story, with excellent acting by Gregory Peck and a great cast. The beautiful setting of the city of Rome and the twists and turns of the storyline make for a thrilling movie without needing the graphic violence of many contemporary  movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was pulled into the story immediately and I couldn't put it down! I stayed up all day & all night for 2 days straight because I NEEDED to finish this book. It's a must read!
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Loved it! It was a classic when I first saw it as a teenager. It was a classic when I read it back in school, and again when I recently read it. And it is still a classic. I love Gregory Peck as Atticus, he was perfectly cast. Great all time classic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|To be honest, I struggled a bit through the first half of the book and almost set it aside several times, but once you get to the halfway point, all the earlier annoyances begin to make since and you literally at put this book down.  A great read.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I thought this was fun and creative. Predictable ending, but great approach. The cast was what drew me to the movie, and it was worth my time.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|This sucks!!  Having fun on my kindle until I got stuck because one of the objects is under the menu tab. Not thought out through.
B002361MJC|5.0|Must read for everyone.  A classic for health.  I recommend this personally tomany people.<br />Many other ooks use the study results
0374214913|5.0|Deightful -Bright -Fun - Different<br />A \\"real\\" story with \\"Great\\" ideas.<br />Mr. Robin Sloan you have written one \\"heck\\"<br />of a wonderful book. I  Love this book.<br />It's a Must buy!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Too much fun! So far this is a blast. Already hooked on Mahjong, this is great fun. Graphics are good so far. I just downloaded this game. Expect to have many hours of enjoyment.
B00009R86L|5.0|Absolute perfect for carrying bags. Normally my Messenger/Photobag/Trombone Gigbag are slipping of my shoulder, but with this shoulder pad that is history!! I saw this shoulder pad on a Trumpet Gigbag of a friend and i had to buy it. But unfortunately i couldn't get in in germany and still you can't get in germany! But thank's Amazon and the www i got it now directly from the US!<br />It is the best buy i did the last Month's
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I thought it was a really cool book! There were a lot of surprises, and it was super funny.<br /><br />P.S<br />Best book
B004NOCCEG|5.0|You will be spitting mad by the end of the film.  The director/producer made the excellent decision to give a straightforward presentation of the events of 2007, letting the people involved speak for themselves.  The interviews of the academic economists are particularly revealing, and quite amusing to see the inflated self-regard that these people have for themselves punctured so thoroughly, before they even realize what's going on.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|it would be!  The watch is handsome and functional, although the font size in the manual is too small to read efficiently.  Still haven't managed to get the second hand to work, but it still tells time.  Will know more when we go to SCUBA lessons this month.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Really enjoyed the cast. Fun overall. The ending was a little odd and abrubt - but overall really enjoyed it.
B002R27J1W|4.0|Wonderful movie, despite the claustrophobic feeling.  Audrey Hepburn is a walking advertisement for Weight Watchers, or something or other.  Incredible.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the series with Pendergast.  I hope this isn't the last of the series as I would really miss this character and his friends.  I was surprised at the major plot move so early in the book, but loved everything that came after.  I don't do spoilers, so anyone who loves a great mystery with super characters and plots that make you think, do the entire Pendergast series.  For those of us already hooked, I loved this book!
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|this game takes  a long time to load. but it is a reslly fun game to play. i like the game.
B009X01FJS|1.0|The case has some nice features but the Kindle will fall just opening the case. Thinking of using Velcro as I mistakenly dlscarded the box and paperwork durning the Christmas rush.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Addicting!<br />Couldn't put it down. One of the best series of books I've ever read! I can't wait for the movies!
B009HELT3C|4.0|I liked it, I'd seen the other 2 and this one keeps the tone, humorous without filthy language, very entertaining...if you enjoyed the other 2 this one is as entertaining
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|This movie was ok, it had some a,axing dancing in it and the acting was good enough but like the last one they are just doing too much. The first two were awesome because it wasn't stimulus overload or ten thousand camera tricks it was just the people and the dancing.
B004LX0D36|5.0|Very happy, it is the best value for the price, the shipment arrived on time and works great.  Thank you
B005DZIML6|1.0|Because &#34;I&#34; wasn't careful & busy I didn't look at the regions & these only play overseas. They REALLY should have something that alerts you to the region though. Maybe, b4 the transactions complete, open a screen w/ that information for people. I can't dog on the service. I suppose by it coming all that way, it wasn't late. I hate it b/c I really wanted to watch those movies. I guess the store is okay :/
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I can't believe the way they put this cast together and made it all seem like Ted was just a part of things. It's a great watch!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recommend this Bible. It is a great resource.  I own several translations but, it is convenient to have them in one place.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is a really cool game I have played it on computer before and it's even more faster and more fun on this game.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bought this cd for my husbands birthday. He thinks it is a great cd. I would recommend to everyone. Sell shipped fast and it arrived on time.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|This game kept me busy for several days. Very challenging and fun to play. Graphics are decent as well.  Cant wait for the next one!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is one of the best book adaptations I've seen. Sure, the casting isn't 100% what I imagined, but they do a good job with it, and it's a beautifully shot movie that generally sticks very closely to the book's storyline. I would definitely recommend this movie, even if you love the book!
B007NU54H4|5.0|A lot of kids movies nowadays make me want to gag, but this is truly a cute and entertaining one.  It is pretty short but held everyone's attention!  Tink has a sister...who knew?
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I fully expected this movie to be terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised by the plot, Halo universe tie-in and special effects.  As a Halo nerd, I give this movie two thumbs up.
B0019GO58C|5.0|This is a great movie from the 1980's when the story lines used to be original.  Meryl plays a woman just going through the motions of life with an average marriage and sometimes job until a chance meeting with someone who turns out to be made for her fills her life with passion and excitement.  While I am NO fan of adultery, this movie is a little something different and makes us all long for the true feelings of love that I feel you cannot fight no matter how hard you try!  Robert DeNiro is excellent in this movie and looks so young!  I am so glad this came out on DVD!!!!!
B005LAIHSG|2.0|There wasn't a booklet with the dvd and the person I gave it to was disappointed and wondered if it was used.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|only can get to level 48 and then it goes to level 1 again.  please fix it good game otherwise.
B008WOULPK|3.0|I worked at Conde Nast many years ago so was interested to hear what Coddington had to say but 3/4 of the way through I'm a bit bored frankly. Perhaps it will get better as I progress but I'm not overly optimistic.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I downloaded and read all of Eckhart Tolle's works available on Amazon (for Kindle) in the last 6 weeks of 2012. I read them in the order they were published. This book was an Oprah pick a couple of years ago and I believe she also did a 21 day workshop of some kind on her program. I was not aware of that and I'm sorry I missed it. I was not even aware that ET was a living author/philosopher! So, I read 3 other books first, then this one. This is definitely an easier, clearer read than the others, especially for anyone not familiar with metaphysics. I have been drawn to metaphysic for 40 years and this book expresses its message. I was absolutely enthralled with The Power of Now. Tolle offers you and explains to you how to experience the flow of God energy in your own life. You do not have to live on a mountaintop for years. You have to stop listening to distracting chatter of your own mind and then enter the Stillness there. I cannot report that I have had that direct experience myself (it is not so easy to stop listening to that chatter) but it is nearer to me than breathing. This book is a must read for anyone searching for answers in their own life, seeking Truth, anyone who has ever wondered what the purpose of their own life is. Your answer can be found here. I am forever grateful to Oprah and this author, Eckhart Tolle.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|As soon as I downloaded Amazon Cloud on my Macbook Pro I was unable to download pictures on Ebay.  The Apple support assistant told me this plug in interferes with this process.  We tried all the other troubleshooting before we discovered it was this download that caused the problem.  I don't know if it affects PC's but if you have a Mac and use Ebay beware.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck is not known for his coherent and beautiful. This one is. These Ballads are woven well with his mood. The music mix<br />is extremely listenable.<br />Listen to &#34;Paper Tiger&#34; and &#34;Round the Bend&#34;. Shawn Phillips watch out!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Pretty disappointed with this. I thought it would be more than a series of short stories.. more in depth characters.. better connected stories.. or at least have a main character through out the whole thing. So far, I'm having a hard time reading through it because it's just several descriptions of what was happening. Some are not even an entire story.
B000LC55F2|5.0|If you want a movie that breaks the mold and keeps you hanging til the end this is it. There are NO weak characters in this one.<br />Watch David Bowie as Tesla, it is a gas!
B003VANOFY|5.0|It's pretty simple; buy these if you're looking for the best.<br /><br />I'm a huge gamer/music nut and I needed some wireless headphones because the corded ones get caught in my chair and just annoy the crap out of me. Plus, I couldn't go more then 4 feet from my computer.<br /><br />These alleviated all those problems. Greatest sound ever (surround sound is so amazing), the 40 foot limit is perfect, and the features that come with the headset that allow for configurations is simple and easy to understand. I absolutely love these headphones.<br /><br />So, as I said, it's pretty simple; buy these headphones.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I found myself anxious to finish it.  Now I'm going back to play the other levels.  This is a game I would let my kids play.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This was one of the most creative Christmas animations that we have seen for a long time!  It was really worth the time.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I almost called in to work the first day I got the app! Graphics are fabulous and it makes you think. Try not to use the hint button too much, though, I think there should be more of a limit on it's usage. All in all, very good choice, highly recommend!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love using Twitter on my Kindle Fire! It is a great app. and it is really easy to use!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good game. It is challenging,  and very fun.  Really glad I got it as the free app of the day.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great! It's addicting, and challenging but not to the point of discouraging you. It definitely makes you think!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Started off somewhat slow, but one it started I was clinging for more on to the next Grisham book. What's next...
B000FC1MCS|1.0|Terrible book! Couldn't even finish it! Writing was pathetic but the story was just plain stupid so don't waste your time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so good! I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who likes exciting books! It is definitely worth the money you would spend on buying it! Great job Suzanne Collins!
B007SGM084|1.0|An imature book that seemed to be a tweens fantasy of falling in love with a rich guy. Didn't even finish the book and its not often I do that!
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Elysium has familiar themes but also has fresh approaches to them.  I can listen to them over and over and still hear something new or provoking.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I liked this book, but it seemed to wrap up a little too neatly for my liking. A good read.
B0027MJU00|4.0|A really taut murder mystery and family drama rolled into one. Grimly amusing, sometimes heartbreaking, always unexpected. Very realistic character.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I didn't enjoy this one as much as the other 2, it had a different feel. It's still worth a read if you liked the first in the series though.
B0001EFTVA|4.0|This movie is based on the Hollywood film The Three Godfathers, where John Wayne and his cronies find a dying woman in the desert after giving birth and agree to take care of her child.  Traveling through the desert out west, they argue with each other over the child's care and curb their own criminal impulses in order to deliver the child safely to the nearest town able to take the infant.  In this story, the characters are homeless citizens of Tokyo, one a cross dresser, one a woman and one a man who have fallen on hard times over the years and eventually took to the streets.  Realizing their behaviors aren't conducive to raising a child, they attempt to mend their ways and face the society they have left.  With the Christmas season in the background, the idea of redemption and goodness abound.  A very sweet Christmas film, from Japan!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Nice to be able to watch this series with no commercial interuptions! I can't wait till they deliver seasons 3 & 4!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have only used it once so far, but the pinseeker option works great!  It is extremely simple to use and I never had any issues with incorrect results.  I like the 5x power, but it does make it a little difficult to hold it still while pressing the power button.  If I have any problems, I simply brace my hands against the golf cart top frame to hold it steady.  I highly recommend this product!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Nice to be able to watch this series with no commercial interuptions! I can't wait till they deliver seasons 3 & 4!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. The character of Jack Reacher wasn't too macho or 1 dimensional. His reasoning and inner thoughts were 'normal' not just 'military', which I appreciated. Made him seem more human and therefore relatable. And the plot just kept going. Everytime I thought I had worked out what was going to happen next, another twist would come up (and I'd have to stay up later and later reading!) making this book hard to put down, even for a coffee break. Can't wait to read the rest and see how the character of Jack Reacher develops further.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The first half of Fifty Shades of Grey had some interesting and intriguing parts.  The second half is too repetitious.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Read several pages of it in Amazon cloud, now can't find it nor can i get it back from Amazon without paying for it again. lost in the system somewhere
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read the entire \\"Wool Omnibus\\" this afternoon, which says a lot for how good it was considering it is nearly 600 pages long. It is an interesting, mature dystopian novel, which is refreshing in a genre overrun by YA books right now. I really enjoyed it, and if you are a character-driven sci-fi fan, you will enjoy it too. It was a nice break in my reading repertoire.<br /><br />The basis of the plot is fascinating. I only wish we got to learn more details about the people pulling the strings of the whole operation. That would have made the story a tad better for me. My only other complaint is that the book seemed a bit long-winded at times. I felt like a couple of the books in the omnibus could have been compressed and the story cut down by 100 pages. Still, it felt wonderful to read a quality sci-fi book and I highly recommend it.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is letting me catch up for the next season, really great TV! Still looking for the parts they said we didn't get from PBS first time around. I do remember some abrupt sceens on the original PBS presentation that I'm not seeing in this UK version. The story just flows beautifuly. Well worth the money!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Just another mindless, meaningless, pointless, killing spree from Hollywood with absurd and violent story and nothing to tell... Don't waste precious time on this garbage. Another flop from Hollywood desperate for good story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and play for hours. It's fun to master the dozer and see how many prizes I can get.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very challenging and fun.  I love it, it keeps me on my toes.  I would recommend this game to anyone that loves a challenge.  Can get interesting at time with the missions but it is a very fun game to play.  It is great for all ages, I play my husband and my children.
B00006RG9K|5.0|This is a brilliant memento of their 1993 tour.<br /><br />I love that they included every song from the concert, this is not a highlights package.<br /><br />The band are so tight and the accompanying visuals during some of the songs are great.<br /><br />As a Genesis fan this ticks all the right boxes.
B003WWZ148|5.0|Bought for son, he likes it a lot, sounds great . Will purchase more at another time thank you very much can't think of anything else
B000TGCR38|5.0|I've been a Verhoeven fan for close to 20 years, and I think this is one of his best films, certainly the equal of Flesh + Blood, Robocop, Soldier of Orange, or Total Recall. The Dutch Resistance movement is a fascinating aspect of WW2 history, and anyone who's interested in the subject should give this film a chance. Great acting, great action, and an excellent plot.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A good King novel.  Would you go back to change the past if you could?  A real thought provoker even though that was probably not his intention. Definitely a good read although a little long.  I wanted to get it done to see how it would end.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|I only listen to instrumental music when I write, and I like evocative tracks that inspire my imagination. This soundtrack does just that, just like the music to the three LotR movies, and with two disks, has enough music for well over an hours' worth of listening. A great purchase.
B006H5120E|5.0|EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.<br /><br />RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR ES BASTANTE RESPONSABLE
B0058BI896|5.0|I really enjoyed this episode of The Big Bang Theory.  Overall the writing for this series is fantastic.  Every single episode I've seen has given us many good laughs.

B008QYT7DI|5.0|When we grow older we forget the innocence and beauty that surrounds us.  Children see through different eyes.  They find truth where we least expect it.  The Little Prince showed us the important lessons we grown ups had forgotten.

B008GWOVB8|4.0|Really, what's not to like about a cool, young John Travolta singing and dancing his heart out over a teenager's first love?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire definitely left me hanging! Glad I waited for the trilogy to be written and published so I won't have to wait in suspense for long!
B006O7XOOW|2.0|Well, it claims to be great for pulling up and creeping but it is so light it topples over on top of my child.  I asked for this as a gift for him and now I feel like it was not a wise decision.  The toy itself is sort of strange- weird music, no challenge to the child...  I would not recommend.
B002YVAT72|4.0|was a gift for another. seemed to enjoy it.  have not tested the mp3 option, but everything else was fun and spot on described
B0091W4PRC|5.0|Best sports movie EVER!  Great for the entire family. I can watch this one over and over.  If someone doesn't like football, they will after seeing this movie.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I was expecting more of a comedy....but it was pretty sad. As a mature woman, it did give plenty &#34;food for thought.&#34;
B00A2AU314|4.0|Not your typical Clint Eastwood, but I liked it. Plot was a little thin, but Eastwood carried it well as always.
1423140605|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK, THIS IS SO HEART WRENCHING, SO DRAMATIC, SO AMAZING, WHY DOES RICK RIORDAN KEEP LEAVING A CLIFF HANGER AT THE END? I CANT WAIT FOR THE HOUSE OF HADES!!!!!!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I've yet to hear anything by these ladies I didn't like. I have several of their previous releases and will continue to collect their music.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great movie,supporting cast pretty much caries movie but made it complete. Good ending for this particular series. Will tell all my friends.
B00003CY5J|5.0|for me this is the great movie I love both of the actors in this thriller for me it was exciting and I recommend you buy
B00526ZKYS|5.0|The story captivated me. I just couldn't stop reading hoping for the best and experiencing everything with the characters. Amazing read
B0031RS7X6|5.0|If you are after something light and humorous you will enjoy :)<br />I found it to be as good as &#34;I've got your number&#34;
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I don't understand how they charged me 2.99 yet I cant download it! RIP OFF! my 4yr old couldn't wait to play this too!
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|I will b  honest that I ha  no clue what was happening  in North Korea. It is hard to believe that people can treat others in this manner!  I gave the book three stars as I did not love the writing  style  of the author but I am glad to be more informed as to the conditions in North Korea.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait to see season 3.  Loved Season one and season two.  Downton Abbey is the best show I have seen in years.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app. Works perfectly. I can't see any way to improve this. I use this app all the time now and have no other alarm clock
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife loves it and I find it entertaining. If you are into Zombies this is very well done with great acting and plot.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is great. I don`know how someone who doesn't know halo would react, but for a halo nerd like myself it is necessary to read this book to gain back knowledge on the entire halo story line from first contact in 2525 to the \\"end\\" in 2552
B009SJ3H8Q|1.0|The first season was really good. The second season the writers lost their way and went beyond the normal balance between horror, reality and good taste. After seven episodes turned it off and cancelled my subscription.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because you can get powers and more money and you can get more people for you
0762434279|1.0|did not realize this was a miniature addition since it was the same price as the regular addition. Lesson learned - pay attention to detail.
0062068423|1.0|This book fails to catch my interest.  It jumped around in time at the wrong place and messed up the story line.  It took too long to get to the point.  This is no Stieg Larsson.  Boring.
B001ISN0F0|4.0|I bought this book for my wife.  It arrived in good time and in good shape.  Very good service.  As usual, 4 Stars because only God is Perfect.
0425252868|5.0|Over the years I've read perhaps a hundred books dealing with World War II, most I will admit have had to do with war at sea.  I can honestly state that I'd never heard of the incident between American 2nd Lt. Charles Brown and German 2nd Lt. Franz Stigler over the skies of Germany on one fateful day.  I'm not sure I would have believed it.  But, I've read the book and the story is true.<br /><br />A Higher Call by Adam Makos and Larry Alexander is perhaps the greatest book about WWII that I've read and that's going some.  A Higher Call is an emotional taffy machine.  It will influence your attitude about the German combatants that faced the allied soldiers.  Instead of all being the monsters we've learned to hate over the years, A High Call provides us with an intimate glimpse into the German ranks, admittedly on a limited basis.<br /><br />If you chose to read A Higher Call, hold on.  Use the chapter breaks to catch your breath.<br /><br />I highly recommend.<br /><br />Semper Fi.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'AM REALLY ENJOYING THIS GAME!  The only downside is knowing when to stop.It can become quite addictive.So have fun playing.
B0062P332Y|4.0|Enjoy the 3 action stars  playing off each other. Supposedly based on a actual story. Would highly recommend it to an action movie fan.
0385535147|2.0|My most favorite part of John Grisham books is the suspense.  I kept waiting for it.  Never got it.  Wondering if this is the first of a sequel and the suspense will come in book 2?  I listened to this on Audible and I did like the narrator but I was disappointed in this novel.  The first half of the book was a good build up but the second half didn't give me what I was hoping for.  May not buy his next book so quickly.
1419702238|5.0|it was a gift for my grand son, he was very happy with it and so I was very happy also
B0085YNML2|4.0|Fun times playing this game!  Occasionally I have to turn it off and come back to it.  I like that it makes me think!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|it was a gift for a friend they were very happy whith it and so I was very happy also
B007V2UGPE|1.0|Right from the start glu tries to dig deep into your wallet. Eventually all upgrades require gold, so don't bother with this game.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|boring .  rather play other games. rather a dumb game. maybe for my 4 year old grandson. just<br />to young for an adult female.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I gave it as a gift so I did not read it myself.  However, the recipient was delighted with it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|THe usual Clancy book.Kept me engrossed from page to page.He is a great story teller and this book again proves how good he is.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing. Couldn't put it down. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series. Loved the characters. Amazing!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter is a Fabulous, well written show. Riveting, keeps you on your seat, I will cry when it ends for sure
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This set of dvd's was sent in a timely manner and I couldn't stop watching the episodes.  Great series and I can't wait to own season 3.  I am sharing them with my family and friends.  Thank you
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I bought this cd because I especially like the song &#34;Viva la Vida&#34;. The cd arrived in timely fashion and in excellent shape.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|VERY user friendly and easy way to store all those photos we all take from our phones. Easy uploads, easy to access from the computer when you want to print or use them and just a really neat program
B006LSZECO|2.0|Starts out solid, gets even better in the middle, but I was waiting for an exciting ending, and instead it just peters out. The characters stop being believable and the end is just weak.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great movie. Humor, action packed, and plenty of references to the game if you're paying attention. The soundtrack is perfect.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It's like a quicker version of LoL.<br />No problems so far. So worth giving a try.<br />I really don't know what to say it's just what I would expect to find in this kind of game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just finished this book in two days! I couldn't stop and put it down! It's a must read! But it's also different from other Spark's books.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I see all the negative reviews in here about thus game and they dint make sense .....thus game rocks on my kindle fire hd ......would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting r p g
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|I loved this documentary - overall it was elegant, minimalist storytelling that let viewers get to know the man, his associates, and his craft without heavy-handed narration and without the filmmaker protruding into the story. There were a few parts where an odd musical arrangement or inconsistent focus (maybe too shallow a depth of field - Jiro kept fading in and out of focus) distracted me, but I enjoyed this thoroughly. I have no idea if I would love it as much without already liking Japan so much...maybe I'll read other reviews to see.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Love Amy Adams in anything ! The acting was believable and it had a great story line. A feel good movie in times when there is so much violence.
B000IDGDPA|3.0|Fairly intriguing.  Enjoyable.  A happy ending proving once again love is forgivng and still had conquering powers for those who have kept the faith.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Will be buying more. Handy, great little things for easy use of microSDs. Have gone through (either lost or given away as gifts) many of these so far.
1455527475|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband after he had continually complained that he was not making any money in the stock market.  He has begun reading it and he seems to be enjoying the book.  This is basically a whistle blowers book on how the stock market investors are controlling the market.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not a bad game.  Fairly easy to play. I like the zoom in feature. Makes it easier to play on a small device like the Kindle Fire.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a very interesting game, ease of use is greatly enhanced from previous versions I have used. I am looking forward to other games!
B001EBWING|4.0|Romantic movie setup during the nazi time. Keeps some suspense till the end and has a nice ending, full of love.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Clear, easy to read, relevant to apply. This book offers a reminder to take responsibility for making our community and our world a better, more peaceful, more productive & positive place to live and grow.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I just started it but so far it is good. I have not yet figured out how to bookmark my page.
030759565X|3.0|This was a requested gift.  I do not know what the receipient thinks of it now that she has it.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|VIntage Asimov! A must read for all Asimov fans. I have read all of the Robot series at least twice. Wish he had written more. Makes everyone want a robot like Daneel.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This powerfully gripping story kept my attention from the first page!  Jodi Picoult's writing style has always been my taste, but this novel in particular was both touching and heartfelt.  I would highly recommend this story of family, friendship, love, and truth.
1449410243|5.0|great book, my and my family laughed a lot reading it, and the drawings are great. recom​mend for all cat owners, it will have you in stiches
B008CFN95I|5.0|One of my best reads yet. Hope he writes again very soon. A must buy for anyone. Interesting background on the IT industry
B009FB3XTA|2.0|Well having all the album soundtracks from twilight I can say this was the worst one !!<br />Its not at all like  New moon and Twilight it don't have that rushing beat like the previous ones<br />I don't know if its because I am a rock fan or not.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|the setup was quick and easy. not much in the help menu. I have 14 pages of juck scrip pending to print that I can't delete.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have the hardback but it's so heavy to hold on to that I decided to get it for my Kindle. So far, I've read it twice and I expect to read it many more times. Inventive, charasmatic hero, well written. I also have the sequel, Day Two which I also love.
B004UPANAI|2.0|Maybe it's what i get for going back in time to get a action film but it wasn't like it came out THAT long ago, but the special effects seemed a little hokie and the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Also, it was rated PG-13, but the language and violence warranted an R rating in my opinion.  Not really worth your time and definitely not worth your money.

B005WYFLNU|5.0|I love how these are resuable!  My daughter is 4 years old and she thinks these are just awesome!  Be aware there are some little stickers in here so they might get lost.  I recommend you take off the OUTSIDE and IN BETWEEN of the stickers so your child and put the stickers back on their sheet where ever they want.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|I began reading this book with high hopes because it was made into this great film. Having read it I still feel the story is interesting and relatable, but the actual structure of the sentences, paragraphs, and book in general made it difficult to read without having to reread page after page because you got lost along the way. Overall I was hoping for a little more from the book, but after all the teenage angst and constant crying, I feel like I walk away from this book rather unchanged...
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Love this movie. Good to watch every-time has something for everyone in the family.<br />My sister is ecstatic every time she sees it playing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have not enjoyed a period drama like this ever.  The language, mannerisms and costumes seem to be spot on!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Came in good condition but the movie itself was found to be slow. Captain America is much better in the Avengers but alone is not that great.
B000TU16GS|4.0|I recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a good spy adventure book.<br />P.S. I am not as conceded to say me me me all the time.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This movie, when I was finally able to view it, was powerful, it gave a point of history that I wasn't aware of.I thought I knew most of England's history with Wallace Simpson and the abdication, I was not aware of the newly crowned King George speech problems. Fine acting, exciting to see a little of what it might have been for Queen Elizabeth as a child. Try to figure out how to play the movie, put it in your library, there may end up being two, try each one, one will play, or call customer service they are excellent at solving video problems. They are a great , friendly group of people. I love my Amazon!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book. It was a really good book because it showed how a different kind of kid dealt with high school.
B007THA4FI|3.0|While I knew JK Rowling was venturing into adult territory with this book, it was a bit weird to read for someone whose a fan of Harry Potter. It's not bad, but at times it was hard to take so much of people who aren't very likeable. I kept hoping someone would redeem themselves but that never happens. Also, I think it goes on a bit too long. Could have ended about 40 pages before it does. I'm glad to have finally gotten New material from Rowling, but next time, can it be  Potter prequel? Her fantasy world is just so creative.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely phenomenal. I loved it and it really tapped in to how real teenagers feel while they're living their actual lives. After reading this book, I feel infinite.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I've had this for about 9 months now and it's finally completely dead.  I quit using it as much as I did when I first bought it because the battery didn't hold a charge well.  I work a lot of hours and use the mouse a lot.  Rechargeable batteries usually last a week or so.  This thing sometimes craps out in the middle of the day after charging all night.<br /><br />I've read every forum on this thing and follow methods to the T.  Powered USB ports, not placing it on metal... everything.  I contacted support about 4-5 months ago about the short time the battery lasts and they would only respond with insulting emails like \\"check if it's plugged in\\".<br /><br />Trying to get a replacement now... but their support system really sucks.  It's most likely not worth the time it will take to get it fixed/replaced.<br /><br />So Don't BUY this product.  It's a bad company, that's makes a so so product.  It's a great concept just doesn't really work.<br /><br />A better idea would have been to make a pack like they have but be able to put your own rechargeable batteries into it.  And make the battery casing metal.  Not cheap plastic.

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Really good movie. Had me entertained the whole time. It's nice to know that people can still make good movies in a generation of remakes.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|i purchased this book thinking it would be a good fantasy, having just finished joe abercrombie's books (the first blade trilogy and the three subsequent stand alone books - i very highly recommend all of these).  in my opinion, this book is terrible.  it seems as though it is written for a child in middle school, but it was not advertised as such.  I may have actually enjoyed this book when i was about ten or eleven but it does nothing for me now.  i must warn you that i only read about a quarter of the book and then had to put it down.  i wanted to put it down after the first page but figured i would try to give it a chance since i had read a number of good reviews, but i could not bring myself to keep going.  i willingly admit that it may have gotten better throughout the second half, but this book is really not for me.  if you enjoy other popular fantasy novels like lord of the rings or a song of ice and fire, i do not think you will like this book.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have always loved this movie. When I was young and in high school I was a singer. I sang nearly everysong in this movie at some event and even a talent contest.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I'm a Courtney Milan fan so I read all of her books.  This series kind of snuck up on me.  I read the DUCHESS AFFAIR and absolutely loved the characters.  She excels at creating interesting people outside the norm of historical romances.  It wasn't until the end that I realized this was the intro to a new series.  I couldn't wait for it to begin.  So far, I've not been disappointed.<br />Keep them coming, Courtney!

B0084TWN9K|5.0|Enjoyed every single story, each one different and surprising. Sometimes disturbing and unexpected but that is life, as Alice Munro opens it up to us. I first read Munro in \\"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\\" and liked her peculiar sense of humour that isn't always comfortable. I was looking out for more of this in this book when I bought it, I suppose, and I wasn't disappointed.
0062202081|5.0|Christmas present for my daughter.  She is a big fan of Justin Bieber and asked for this book for Christmas.  Out of the huge chunk of change we spend on her at Christmas, THIS BOOK was her favorite gift.  Lots of pictures and enough about Justin to make you feel like you know him.  Well done!
B005UWGRIC|5.0|Have to admit, I'm more of a Robbie fan, than Take That fan - the concert started pretty well with just the 4 of them, but I was blown away when Robbie came on stage - it almost seemed like Take That were his openers.  When all 5 came together, the concert was great, fantastic lighting, dancers, video screens though I did think the concert ended quietly.

B0093LFGMO|5.0|I think what I admire Robbie for the most, is having the guts to keep on truckin' and releasing new and different stuff.  I think I'll always love his earliest tracks the best, but his newer albums are inspired - for example, Rudebox was inspired. Other bands have a tendency to release same-old, same-old on every album over the years - Robbie however, likes to ring in the changes each time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved reading this book. I can not wait to read the next one. This was just really good reading and normally I do not like to read
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I didn't know if I was going to get into this book but the more I read it the more I wanted to read on. It's an interesting book about how the human brain works to build habits and how those habits are put to use.

B003QP4BJM|3.0|I bought this book because it sounded like me. I'm a serious optimist that always sees the glass half full. However, this was really just a history book. While it made good points about how we have come so far and improved so much, it just got boring at times.
B001706I5I|5.0|I wantch this movie every year (and sometimes in the middle of July) because it is just such a great adaptation of the classic book and cartoons. It is perfect for the whole family. Plus now that I am older I get more of the jokes and that just makes it even better.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The title says it all: Highlights from the Motion Picture Soundtrack.<br /><br />This album does not have ALL the songs from the movie, most notably (SPOILER ALERT), not the song when Eponine is dying...<br /><br />There are definitely some slip ups, pitchy-ness, and throaty bits from the actors/singers in these songs, but I can appreciate it because it makes them seem more human, to me anyway. Just knowing the music is uncut and undoctored makes it all the more impressive when those magical melodic moments do happen. I think everyone can agree that Ann Hathaway's performance of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; is both Oscar and Grammy worthy...can she get a Tony too?
B00006G8K0|5.0|From 1958 to 1976, the longest Dracula series was made. The official series only lasted until 1974 but the series main star, Christopher Lee did not like the treatment that the classic vampire was treated and starred in two unnoficial entries. He actually only starred in 7 out of the 9 official installments. He was replaced in one of the entries and the other Lee/less Hammer Dracula film did not feature Dracula at all but one of his disciples. Depsite Lee hating the Hammer films they have become beloved among fans and that is why today we are going to look into this classic Dracula franchise.We will be looking into both official and unofficial installments.<br /><br />Horror of Dracula. The original film directed by Terence Fisher is a classic of the genre. It is the first notable Dracula film to feature the  trademark fangs after Carl Leamlle had deemed them to shocking for 1931 audiences in the Bela Lugosi version. Altough it is based on the Bram Stoker novel it ommits several details and creates a plot almost of its own. This and the fact that it is named Horror of Dracula could make it feel as tough it is a loose sequel to the Universal series which was more like the stage play. The acting is great with 3 unparalleled actors leading the film. These are Peter Cushing, the underrated Micheal Gough and Christopher Lee. I actually think that Lee, while playing the title character, is the weakest, not because of his performance because of the script which gives him a small amount of dialogue and limited screentime. This does not work against the movie but just raises the tension as you know that Dracula could have struck anytime. The film was a big succes even tough it was panned by critics of the time who tought it was just a showcase for splattering blood. However nowadays it is considered a classic, it s popularity even rivaling the Lugosi film and even tough it is tame by today standards, it shows more of the expected Dracula goods than the Universal movie.<br /><br />Brides of Dracula. Ironically, the first Dracula sequel did not feature the count. It was about Van Helsing hunting down the disciples of Dracula. Apparently the producers where afraid of the paycheck that Lee would demand. It seems like it would be a disaster but it turned out to be a classic vampire film. In my opinion the sequel is superior to the original with a more gothic atmosphere and the return of Terence Fisher. The structure is similar to the previous film in which the  first act is about a minor protagonist visiting a strange castle, the second is about the vampire killing people and Van Helsing recruiting allies while he investigate and the third is a climactic confrontation with the vampire. The producers made some stange marketing choices, with posters that looked nothing like the film but more like a visit to the underworld of greek methology. But the most profitabe move was the casting of a younger actor, David Peel, as the vampire, similar to the portrayal of Frank Langella in the 1979 version. However, this being Hammer they where not afraid to disfigure him in the ending! The only way to get this film alone on DVD is buying it in region 2, which is normally more affordable when it comes to Hammer Dracula films<br /><br />Dracula Prince of Darkness. Christopher Lee returns in the 3rd entry in the film series. The plot of this film will be quite common to todays audience because of the over abundance of young people take a wrong turn films. There is even a series called wrong turn. Another feature similar to modern films is that the monster is mute. Unlike modern films however, this film has an interesting monster because of a varied and monstrous performance instead of the dull acting of modern slashers. Sadly this was director Terence Fishers las Dracula outing as he chose to focus on Frankenstein films. He goes out with a bang because this film is pure fun. Also, it shows two concepts from the novel that where not seen in the unfaithful Horror of Dracula. These are the famous Reinfield, altough with a different name, and the scene where Dracula cuts his chest to feed his blood  to the heroine. Peter Cushing is missed but with a brutal ressurection scene and Lee and Fisher making a perfect blend, the film works.<br /><br />Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. The 4th Hammer Dracula replaces Terence Fisher with Freddie Francis, a less appropiate but still qualified director. By now the series had stopped using Bram Stoker material altough it still had a lot to cover. So this movie went with the concept of faith. Its hero is an atheist. He is very likeable as his girlfriends uncle is a priest and he is outraged when he finds out. Unlike the previous films which where fantasical from the star, this one is more about the effect that Dracula has to the pedestrian population. This makes our characters more relatable as we know more about their common day activities. It sort of reminds me of the 4th Hammer Frankenstein. I felt that Dracula did not have enough to do because of his over reliance on servants. The hunters attempts to kill him are spectacular with Dracula barely caring about stakes. The beggining in the church feels unnecesary but it quickly catches up  and this film is still a solid and toughtful Dracula film<br /><br />Taste The Blood of Dracula. Unlike many fans I prefer this film to the previous entry. It has a more original story to tell, even if that story is very removed from normal Dracula territory. It is about the sins of the father and a social satire of victorian England ethics. This is actually the first time the series visite England as the other movies decided to stay closer to home. The metaphor is interesting even if Dracula feels forced, he has such a small amount of lines that you van count his words and the reasons for his traditional revenge feel contrived. The only thing we need to know is that Dracula is after 3 evil men who all have mistreated their children. The head man of the group is a worse than Dracula and you feel happy when he bites the dust. It is also a very well done death. Surprisingly, Lee is upstaged in this movie by Ralph Bates. Bates palys Courtley a completely insane servant of Dracula who is both manipulative and crazy. His performance is so good that I wished that he got to play Dracula himself. Originally Courtley was to return as a vampire instead of the count. I would have preferred that to Lee's frankly dull performance in this movie, where he seems to have flunked grammar as he only speaks in short sentences. Frankly, it is Lee's Dracula at it's worst. The distributors demanded that Dracula be in the actual movie. Those distributors always seem to ruin certain aspects of the series. Also the ending with the hero, who has the same name as the one from Dracula 4, having to save the girl seems forced but I liked that Dracula was done in by his own arrogance. While I watched this movie I really wanted Hammer to do more Dracula films as it was my first Hammer Dracula. I may be giving it too much credit because of this but I still believe that depsite the meddling distributors it is still a fun and original entry.<br /><br />Count Dracula. We have gotten to the first unnoficial installment in the series. I congratulate those readers that are still with me after my first five reviews and hope you will get to the end of them with me. I have a lot to say about this one as it has a fairly complex production history. Basically, Christopher Lee was tired of being shafted in the Hammer Horror movies. He loved the Bram Stoker novel but he felt that Hammer did not care about faithfully adapting the book. After hearing about a adaptation that would follow the novel closely he rushed out to audition for the part. Because of the production's low budget he signed on with a small salary, in the hopes that his  dream adaptation would be made. The studio wanted Vincent Price to play his nemesis, Van Helsing, but Price was not so content about the low pay. Hammer had tried to get him to play one of the 3 amoral men in that year's Taste the Blood of Dracula but had been met with the same response. The director,schlock master Jesus Franco then wanted Dennis Price, but had to settle for his third pick, Helbert Lom. In the end the film was not as faithful as it promised, but we're not here to analyze the faithfulness but the films themselves. The first half hour is actually very faithful and Lee seems to relish speaking dialogue taken right out of the book. Throughout the Hammer series he tried to sprinkle frases from the novel in Dracula's rather limited speeches. The other actors do not fare much better except for Herbert Lom and Klaus Kinski, who gave a masterful but silent performance as Reinfield. He is really as versatile as Lon Chaney. However the acting is not bad just sort of bland. This is a problem with the lovers in Dracula 1931, and that is still a classic. The vampire Lucy is handled well and really effective even if she wears a black dress instead of white. Talking of appearences, the Dracula in this movie looks rather different from the Hammer films' more traditional Dracula and is arguably, the closest to the book's description in that he has a long and thick mustache, which Lee manages to pull off rather well, gets younger as the story unfolds, and uses a cape infrequently. Other features are that Christopher Lee has longer hair and his teeth are more canine, seeming longer and easier to see, giving some suspense to Harker's journey. The directing is very unique and manages to save some of the movie's more dull moments. It is weird with many close ups, establishing shots and a more realistic and grainy look than the Hammer films. It reminds me of the popular and fun Santo flims from Mexico. The score by Bruno Nicolai may seem bizzare alone or with any other movie but it fits with the insanity of this fim. The most insane moment is a scene where disected animals seem to come alive but only make strange sounds and make the stars shudder. It does have a creepy feel to it and I really like it. Because of it being more faithful to the novel it feels like a different tale than horror of Dracula and, because of this it is Christopher Lee's favorite of his Dracula movies. When viewing you must remember that this is not Bram Stoker's novel, it is Jesus Franco's Dracula.<br /><br />Scars of Dracula. This has got to be one of my favorite Hammer Draculas. The gothic horror is perfect. It features some similarities to the novel such as Dracula's Spider/Man like wall crawl and Dracula acting like a nice host to one of the main characters. This gives Chris Lee more to do than in many previous outings and an acceptable amount of screentime. The story is cliche and not all that interesting but the way it is presented is masterful. The ending is epic and I will not spoil it. Dracula also starts acting like a slasher villan in some instances. The film is noticeably the goriest of the Hammer series with some gruesome bat attacks on display. Many people say that it is low budget and it shows, but it feels lavish compared to Count Dracula and is on par or better to everything after Brides of Dracula. Chris Lee's makeup is a little bit more white than usual. This would continue until The Satanic Rites of Dracula, and returned with The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. It was supposed to be a reboot and was released in a double bill with Horror of Frankenstein in 1970. Being the third Dracula film that year, after Taste the Blood of Dracula and Count Dracula, it was ignored and the only critics who reviewed it hated it, even Christopher Lee seemed to ignore it even tough it gave him more things from the novel to do, because of his excitement about Count Dracula, which at it's time was the closest to the book. It is time that we pay attention to this classic and give it the reputation it deserves.<br /><br />Dracula a.D 1972. After the muted response to Scars of Dracula, Hammer went back to the drawing board and created another reboot. This one was set in modern day to make it more accesible to younger audiences. This may sound like a great idea but it terribly dates this film. It feels more like a time capsule than anything else, with hippies running around and lame 70's bands playing bad songs. Hammer was to afraid to put Count Dracula in this surroundings, so he spends the entire movie in a gothic church and makes the minions do all the work after Scars of Dracula had made Dracula seem competent again. Let me state this, this is not a good movie, it's a bad movie, but it has this unique flavor of entertainment all it's own. It marks the return of Peter Cushing to the saga after he left in Brides of Dracula. 12 years have passed and the years have not been kind to him. He looks frail but still manges to turn in an A plus performance. You should watch it for Cushing and Lee, if nothing else.<br /><br />Satanic Rites of Dracula. You should know that this is the only Dracula film to fall into the public domain. That doesn't sound good. I hate to sound like a broken record amongst the many reviews but this movie is the worst of the series. It feels more like a spy film than horror, the plot is convoluted and Dracula feels more like Dr. Doom than the king of the vampires. Come on, destroying all mankind with the bubonic plague, does that sound like Dracula! At first it doesn't even feel like a Dracula film, it's more like a mystery with supernatural overtones. Dracula's demise is laughable and makes him out to be a bumbling fool. Van Helsing does not seem much smarter as he uses a tiny gun and has only one silver bullet!Where's Hugh Jackman's armory when you need it!Still, Peter Cushing's portrayal is much better and Chris Lee gives an epic portrayal of Dracula. They should really get him to play a Marvel Comics supervillan. Regretably, that does not save this movie from mediocrity and sometimes being downright boring.<br /><br />Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. After the terrible SRoD, Hammer could not save their series'dignity but they could still make a fun movie. Christopher Lee did not think so and after reding the script he backed out from the film, vowing to never don the cape again.Too bad for him! This movie is a total blast with or without him. After the martial arts boom, Hammer teamed up with the Shaw Bros. to create a new sequel. Maybe Chris Lee backed out but another Lee did indirectly have a great influence on this movie. Yes, Bruce Lee probably inspired the producers to make this movie because of his popularity. The film makes an interesting mix of traditional and chinese vampire legends. The chinese vampires feature allusions to several myths such as that of the hopping vampire. From the traditional myths comes Dracula. Since Chris Lee did not want to be involved they hired John Forbes Robertson to play the count. He makes a good count, but not as commanding as Chris Lee. His performance is offputting because of his makeup. I mean he looks like a clown. Peter Cushing manages to keep his dignity. The Kung Fu is awesome because of the gory reactions. The bad thing is that Dracula's death feels anticlimactic. This was the last official Hammer film however Chris Lee returned for another unofficial rumble. I wonder how they made him return.HMMM<br /><br />Dracula and Son. First of all I bought my DVD at Ebay with the dubbing actually being provided by Chris Lee. You might ask why I'm talking about dubs. The last Chris Lee Dracula film was made in France and in French. The VHS on sale here has a bad dub, without Chris Lee's voice, and a shortened run time. I have not seen it but I've read the reviews. With the version I have, the film is a fun, smart comedy that sort of slows down by the second act but is funny again by the end. You may be wonderig how did they get Lee back. They didn't. He was told that this movie was just a father and son vampire comedy. That's why the name Dracula is only in the title. The only bad parts which slow down the film are the parts in the son's apartment. Dracula actually becomes a movie star. This is the part where Dracula gains his cape, because  previously he used a more french suit. The most hilarious parts are Transylvania and especially a part where old Drac tries to bite a woman in her bed. It may seem like a strange wayto end the series but really it's a heartfelt comedy where Dracula is not as reformed as you'd think. This is the end to my long review series. Goodbye, I hope you got trough it and enjoyed it.t only make strange sounds and make the stars shudder. It does have a creepy feel to it and I really like it. Because of it being more faithful to the novel it feels like a different tale than horror of Dracula and, because of this it is Christopher Lee's favorite of his Dracula movies. When viewing you must remember that this is not Bram Stoker's novel, it is Jesus Franco's Dracula.<br /><br />Scars of Dracula. This has got to be one of my favorite Hammer Draculas. The gothic horror is perfect. It features some similarities to the novel such as Dracula's Spider/Man like wall crawl and Dracula acting like a nice host to one of the main characters. This gives Chris Lee more to do than in many previous outings and an acceptable amount of screentime. The story is cliche and not all that interesting but the way it is presented is masterful. The ending is epic and I will not spoil it. Dracula also starts acting like a slasher villan in some instances. The film is noticeably the goriest of the Hammer series with some gruesome bat attacks on display. Many people say that it is low budget and it shows, but it feels lavish compared to Count Dracula and is on par or better to everything after Brides of Dracula. Chris Lee's makeup is a little bit more white than usual. This would continue until The Satanic Rites of Dracula, and returned with The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires. It was supposed to be a reboot and was released in a double bill with Horror of Frankenstein in 1970. Being the third Dracula film that year, after Taste the Blood of Dracula and Count Dracula, it was ignored and the only critics who reviewed it hated it, even Christopher Lee seemed to ignore it even tough it gave him more things from the novel to do, because of his excitement about Count Dracula, which at it's time was the closest to the book. It is time that we pay attention to this classic and give it the reputation it deserves.<br /><br />Dracula a.D 1972. After the muted response to Scars of Dracula, Hammer went back to the drawing board and created another reboot. This one was set in modern day to make it more accesible to younger audiences. This may sound like a great idea but it terribly dates this film. It feels more like a time capsule than anything else, with hippies running around and lame 70's bands playing bad songs. Hammer was to afraid to put Count Dracula in this surroundings, so he spends the entire movie in a gothic church and makes the minions do all the work after Scars of Dracula had made Dracula seem competent again. Let me state this, this is not a good movie, it's a bad movie, but it has this unique flavor of entertainment all it's own. It marks the return of Peter Cushing to the saga after he left in Brides of Dracula. 12 years have passed and the years have not been kind to him. He looks frail but still manges to turn in an A plus performance. You should watch it for Cushing and Lee, if nothing else.<br /><br />Satanic Rites of Dracula. You should know that this is the only Dracula film to fall into the public domain. That doesn't sound good. I hate to sound like a broken record amongst the many reviews but this movie is the worst of the series. It feels more like a spy film than horror, the plot is convoluted and Dracula feels more like Dr. Doom than the king of the vampires. Come on, destroying all mankind with the bubonic plague, does that sound like Dracula! At first it doesn't even feel like a Dracula film, it's more like a mystery with supernatural overtones. Dracula's demise is laughable and makes him out to be a bumbling fool. Van Helsing does not seem much smarter as he uses a tiny gun and has only one silver bullet!Where's Hugh Jackman's armory when you need it!Still, Peter Cushing's portrayal is much better and Chris Lee gives an epic portrayal of Dracula.

B00A0SJWQU|2.0|Why do we insist on destroying the movies that I loved as a kid. This movie has some great looking special effects - as does every movie made at this point. There is waaay too much Kate Beckinsale in this movie. She is a horrible actor, and this would have to be one of her worst roles. Colin Farrell was OK I guess, but still can't make up for this utterly ridiculous plot. At least the 3-boobed woman made an appearance.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator fills the screen of my Kindle Fire, is fast, clearly visible, and convenient to use.  Its always just a finger tap away.  I take it with me when on a photo shoot, and because its a Kindle Fire app it sits right next to all my other apps that I use when on a shoot.  I don't really expect much from a calculator so none of this is ground breaking news to any of you.  I try to travel light and eliminate juggling equipment.  In this regard it eliminates another piece of hardware I have to keep tract of and look for.

B001P06GX4|5.0|I ordered this game based on the other reviews and am pleased to say we love this game as well. We try to have a board game night once a week but finding games for two people isn't exactly easy but this game fits the bill perfectly. It can be played equally well by two or four players and it lasts long enough to take up an evening...Note: keeping the two colors straight as to order can be difficult if you have more than a beverage or two :)

0452273331|4.0|I've only had the book a couple of weeks or so.  It's a thousand pages of tiny print.  It will take me a year to read, but I have high expectations as to the content.<br />The book itself is very nice, and I received it very quickly.<br />As for the content, I'll have to let you know later.
B005LAIHGI|2.0|Just a very silly comedy. One those too stupid comedies. I rather watch a real one. There was a dumb plot. Stupid doesn't make it funny. SMH
B0086213XW|2.0|Odd, you know Seth Rogen's character is the only one that isn't two-dimensional.  I would have given it one star were it not that the film does illustrate a good point, underscored by one of the supporting characters lines: \\"New things get old\\".  If your happiness depends upon others, you are most likely headed for a long road of disappointments and despair.<br /><br />One other note I'd make is this film has a strange feeling toward the end that despite being overly long, a lot of important stuff has been edited out. You may walk away feeling like did - as if I had just drunkenly run over someone's trash cans, wondering where the hell did they come from, and what am I doing out here anyway?

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really loved this book.  I do realize the author was limited in certain ways with what he was able to bring to light.  However, I hope people pay attention to what our government is doing to our servicemen!  Seriously?  You send special ops into a situation that's life or death and put all kinds of limits on them???  That's so wrong in so many ways.  Is anyone in DC looking out for our servicemen's best interests?  Look at page 141 re &#34;slapped with a new requirement to call them out.&#34;  Why did the one helicopter almost crash?  Shouldn't our men be in the BEST equipment?  Their lives and our success as a country depend on it.  Imagine HAVING to go into a confined space, like stairs (page 235), knowing you're likely to be shot at?  (and people question whether there's really PTSD)<br /><br />Last, but not least, page 299.  I hope people either hear the author's plea or think about their own families and consider doing something, in some way--donating time, money, clothes, to help veterans who have come back.  Make an effort to raise your level of awareness and educate yourselves about how much they need, how much our government has truly let them down--there is a HUGE number of military families on food stamps (just Google it, for Pete's sake).  If enough people pull together, perhaps our government would take care of our service men and women the way they should and the way they deserve.  They has sacrificed EVERYTHING they could for this country and the people in it--even giving up their lives, if it works out that way; their families raising the children alone for years while they serve, and so much more.
B000002J1I|3.0|Soo... the music from maestros from Yes, the most superior band in music, 'sold out' with 'Tormato' - That front cover was obviously designed with selling to the masses in mind, it just speaks \\"multi-platinum\\" to you.<br /><br />And then there's the music, and what's this, no 20 minute routines of excellence? Oh deary me. Maybe their brain cells were decreasing, or, in fact, was their greed increasing?<br /><br />Either way, Tormato is a nice album to listen to - 'Arriving UFO' is a catchy gem with some outstanding synthsesiser work from Rick \\"I'm gonna leave the band\\" Wakeman, with no less impressive work from Steve Howe. But it's a goofy little charmer that'll quickly irritate those proggers with the superior musical taste.<br /><br />'Release release' - zeesh that Jon Anderson sings really fast, but if my ears are fast I can understand him. Apparently their admission of defeat to punk rock. Whatever it is, it's a great track.<br /><br />My favourite song though would have to be 'Onwards' - a heart-melting love song with gorgeous vocal harmonies. I can leave the rest to the wind, but 'Circus of Heaven' - I can't stand that song.<br /><br />Interestingly, only this album and 'Going for the one' prominently feature the synthesiser, I find that the guitars and bass generally dominate the other albums. Overall, it's a good album.
B0036O0ELC|5.0|EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE ROLE OF \\"TURANDOT\\" IS A KILLER FOR THE VOICE.  THAT'S WHY CALLAS GAVE UP SINGING IT ON STAGE EARLY ON.  IN THIS RECORDING, THOUGH, CALLAS PULLS OUT ALL OF THE STOPS AND \\"NAILS IT\\" TO PERFECTION. THE VOICE IS SIMPLY THRILLING--LOVELY IN THE \\"SOFTER\\" MOMENTS AND EDGY AND THRUSTING IN HER MORE CHALLENGING AND MENACING ONES.  TULLIO SERAFIN IS, AS ALWAYS, A MASTER AT THE HELM.  THIS IS A GRAND RECORDING OF ONE VERY GRAND OPERA.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this is great for taking quick notes like at the doctors office, baseball game scores, bowling scores, even a quick grocery list
0143116738|5.0|I am in a techer training program and I stumbled upon a video of a speech Sir Ken Robinson gave on changing educational paradigms.  I've been a fan ever since.  One of my teachers had this book and I read the intro and determined then and there that I needed to read the whole thing.  So, I ordered copies for my entire cohort.  Everyone should read this book.
B001NIA27E|4.0|I saw it when it came out in theaters back in '97. While there are obvious creative license employed throughout the movie, it is a really believeable movie. The setting of the movie, a small town set in the American Rockies celebrating their founding and being named the \\"2nd most desirable town, population under 20,000.\\" The script, acting, and flow of the characters goes well together like a well oiled machine. Definatly worth having in your DVD or Instant Video collection.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|the play was not as good as the book. It took me by surprise on what its actually about, thanks to my daughter
B00AAX68HG|3.0|To me it didnt seem like it had anything to do with the product description...but if you like puzzles and brain teasers then go for it. Its more about adding pieces together to make one giant pudding monster than scaring the people when they open the fridge.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I am enjoying this game.  I especially like playing it on my new kindle.  I look forward to getting more games in the future.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Found Alabama Shakes on the radio when I heard Hold On, so struck by the qualitie(s) of Brittany's voice...reminiscent of Janice's, so edgy.<br />Read Alabama Shakes story online, a culmination of the unexpected blends so beautifully! Keep it up! Don't lose your focus!<br />You have so much more music to give us...Get out on the road and share your sound!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book rocked my world...again and again and again.  I will be reading every book this author has written----i can't get enough of her writing style and her characters.  Disturbing, highly addictive read!!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a little hesitant to purchase a book written for the teenage audience. But all I can say is Whew!!!! what a storyline. The author is a gifted writer. She gave me such a visual of everything mentioned in the book - I felt like I was there watching in person. It was an easy read, fast moving story making me gasp for more!  It's worth every dime.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD.  I was touched to my soul.  I cried and will watch it over and over.
1451695187|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much that as I was reading it, I told my sister and all of my nieces and other family members about it.  My husband wants to read it next.  So I have to share it with him too.  Thank you
B00338QENI|4.0|The novel \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is a very well written book.  This story is about a women who lived during the 1950's, her name was Henrietta Lacks.  Shortly after Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she started her treatment.  During surgery, the doctors took a sample of her tumor and sent it to be analyzed.  There, they found out that her cancerous cells were immortal, doubling every 24 hours.  The rest of the story tells how Henrietta's family deals with the discovery of her cells and it looks back into Henrietta's life prior to cancer.  The story is very believable because it is a non fiction novel so everything in it happened in real life.  As soon as I started reading, I was hooked!  I read it within a few days and actually learned a lot and felt strongly about some subjects in the book.  The characters are all realistic and actually lived or are still living today.  I found out a lot of information about the characters in the story because the author interviewed Henrietta's daughter herself and wrote a lot of the book thanks to her.  It was also a really nice touch that about half way through the book the author showed you pictures of the main characters or places they lived.  It helped me visual more throughout the book.  This story takes place all around the world because He-La cells are literally everywhere!  But most of the family lives in East Baltimore now and lived in Clover, South Carolina when they were younger.<br /> The science content presented throughout the book I thought was very accurate.  I already learned so much that I'm not sure what else I could find if I researched for more information.  But I wouldn't mind taking time to do it if there was more for me to learn.  My overall opinion of the book \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is that I'm glad I chose this book to do my book project on because it was very easy to understand and follow along with.  I like how it goes back and forth in time throughout the book also.  I would most certainly recommend the book to my friends or even older adults.  Some parts would be difficult for younger kids to understand though so I would recommend it to people of the age fifteen and above.  I would give this book a total of 4 stars out of 5.  It was a very good book and I'm glad I read it!  I have a feeling it may come in handy even in my future.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I found it interesting, but it was just so, so. Really not my type of story, was a far out story.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Very good acting, great storyline and set design for time period. Keeps your interest and can't wait for another episode.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Many entertaining elements.  Drama, comedy...I wish there weren't so many words required to make these stupid review requests go away from my screen.

B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Love this app. It is very addictive and works fine on my Asus tablet. Like the many different levels and trying to figure out how to finish them.
B004M20YDU|5.0|So, the original Tron movie score is good and well worth having.  The R3CONF1GUR3D disc is AWESOME!!!  You NEED this disc.
B00499QUK2|5.0|My daughter told me she thought I would enjoy Sherlock and she was right.  I have only started watching the first season and I am totally hooked.  The characters are compelling and the update to the original is very entertaining.  I am looking forward to season 2 already!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Man, awesome movie, even better sound track.  Love this disc.  Nice and mellow at times, but energetic at times too.
0140177396|5.0|Must Read!  One of my favorite books.  All of my sisters really loved it too! Very enjoyable for all ages.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of the parts are made of plastic.  The truck itself is sturdily made but the side mirrors, bumpers, lights, etc....are made of plastic.  I doubt that my 3 year old grandson will be able to play with this without breaking some of these off.  By and large though it is the best made truck I was able to find anywhere else.<br />He was extremely happy with it when he got it for Christmas!!!
B0086HGW42|5.0|Great album! Full of songs that will definitely stick with you throughout the day. I would recommend this album to anyone with ears.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|This movie is well worth watching, you will laugh at every turn. Will  Ferrell plays a human living in the North Pole thinking he is a elf. When he finds out he isn't a elf and hes a human, he goes on a journey to the big city (New York) to find his father.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it and it's not hard!!!!! Thanks you for making it free, I got it on my kindle fire

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Great and funny book I loved it I love all of the diary of a wimpy kid books best book yet
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely love this game, and think it is educational to everyone who plays it. This game activates children's creativity and love for the environment and animals. I would absolutely rate it, and other 'story' games five stars.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Both performances are as good as you would expect from these highly talented actors.  I didn't expect it to cut quite so deep into what a boring routine marriage can become.  Jones' character is something of a bully and resists almost all efforts to change things until the very end -- which is not completely convincing.  Streep is her own brilliant self completely inhabiting the character of a wife who wants to please, but needs a little more from life.  She moved this old widow almost to tears at moments. Not your choice if you are looking for excitement and adventure, but a piercing look at what you don't want your marriage to become.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|George Harrison is a wonderful subject for a documentary.  He is a music icon, a spiritual seeker, and a family man.  I found the long documentary holding my attention throughout!  The reminiscing aside, I think that most people who value creativity and like music, will enjoy the story of this man.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I normally enjoy Grisham, but this one was unusually disappointing.<br /><br />I keep a book list on my PDA and rate them for future reference.  When I write DNF (did not finish), well, it's just a dud.<br /><br />I can't believe it's on the best selling list, but, then, I bought it because it was Grisham, so, maybe everyone else did, too.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Though it is rated R some parents may feel it might be ok because it has a teddy bear but let me tell you that the teddy bear has some of the worst language in a movie.  It is a very funny movie and great for a bunch a laughs.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|It is a really great grouping of songs from the genius behind Steely Dan. You won't be sorry for making the investment to own this & adding it to your playlists.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|This was right up my alley as I am a widow of the same age as those portreyed in the movie and for once there was no violence.  The emotions portrayed came across as real and the humor was great.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Gave this to my girlfriend as a Christmas gift... We have not been able to stop watching this... Many late nights in front of the tv cuddled under a blanket ;)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great graphics and challenging levels have made this one of my favorites. In addition, I wasn't able to beat it in a day or two, which I liked. Easily worth $5.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|As a Woody fan who has a great and ongoing interest in the period and characters assembled in Midnight In Paris I was greatly<br />pleased with the storyline and portrayal of the characters.....even Gertrude Stein came across as a real person and the Hemingway<br />character is right on.....Woody caught the flavor of Paris both visually and musically including a portrayal of Josephine Baker.....only his<br />depiction of Zelda seemed to be off....wish I could have been there.<br /><br />A real treat and a great buy.<br /><br />Ron Black
0446677450|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my son.  He read it and thought that it was a complete joke.

B009NPK1IO|5.0|LOVEd the last season!! Wish it would have been more than ten episodes but it had a really good ending!
B006ZS4G24|5.0|Was a gift for my grand-daughter. She loved it. thought it was the BEST. Lots of pieces. She will be putting together for days.
0689105657|5.0|A great insight through fiction, to the history of an ancient culture which has risen, at a great cost by both western and eastern views, to become an economic super power.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|Very happy with this product. I received this product with in a few days. I would recommend this to a friend
B0068FYZIO|5.0|The story is very helpful for the history leason that young adults should know.  There is a lot of good info about those date and times in history.  Its inportant to me to have the young adults know about this place and time in our history.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|I love Jane Austen as much as the next girl & I was so excited to read Emma. However, the style is sometimes a bit difficult to get around!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is only getting better and better and season 3 is no exception!<br />I need to have six more words.
0345472322|4.0|This trade book came in on time and in perfect condition. I bought as a class requirement & I definitely learned a lot. Great read!
B0091QS88K|5.0|My 5 yo daughter and 2 1/2 yo son both love the Dr. Panda apps. My daughter loves to make meals for the animals and mix and slice.  She really likes Dr. Panda's hospital. We even paid for the full version of that one. Good free app. I'd recommended it.
0307276902|5.0|This book came in very early & in perfect condition. I haven't put it down! It is so real & a great read. I absolutely recommend to anyone and everyone!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It shipped exactly when they said it would and I haven't stopped watching it since. The film quality is fantastic!!!
0425263908|3.0|When buying this book, I knew what type of book I was buying. HOWEVER, I did not know that it would be almost the exact storyline of 50 Shades of Grey! I didn't want to re-read a book I've already read. It was a bit of a disappointment.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|The book did not grasp my attention as much as I had hoped for. All in all not my type of book but it was okay
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on all my devices: Win7 desktop and laptop, iPhone, and now Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;, AND IT WORKS!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|It kept me reading which I liked and I have heard her book gone girl is awesome so I will read another book by her
6305922756|5.0|The movie follows aound the fictious band Spinal Tap. The movie set the stage for others to come later but remember to turn the volume up to 11.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved it, 1st sci-fi to do sci-fi right in a long time. I loved the hole idea of the book.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We were able to see the series from the beginning and are now eagerly awaiting season 3.  Downton Abby is fantastic!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was wonderful but heartbreaking . In my opinion I think they should make a fourth book. These books (The Hunger games,Catching Fire,and Mockingjay) were the best books I have ever read. So if you've never read them .... READ THEM!! :)
B0087DFIYA|3.0|This movie was well done with one exception.  A knowledge of Spanish would have added to my enjoyment.  The subtitles came fast and on TV screen were small and hard to read before they were gone.  The speech in some of the spanish was quick to meet the tempo of the action and I felt my experience would have been much better if I would have known all that was said.
0802473156|5.0|Great book that will help any couple communicate and learn to love deeper.  Very easy read with practical tips at eh end of each chapter to help get the process started.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|Philip K Dick is a visionary author. The story is intriguing but to me, the most interesting parts are the descriptions of the future. Many products and habits have come true, like sending a 'stant (an instant message) and having a largely freelance workforce. Great read.
B009LA1QW6|4.0|I never heard of Lana Del Rey before, and seeing her album come up on recommendations, I just assumed she was another auto-tuned pop princess, like Katy Perry.  So I bought this album, blindly, during the Christmas Eve sale on amazon. It was very cheap, and although I never had heard a single song by her I decided it was worth a download. I must have been living in a middle-age bubble, because this is just a fantastic release.<br /><br />'Ride' - opens the proceedings, and it was the beginning of my downfall into the noir world of the concept that is Lana Del Rey. I was taken aback by the alto, as I wasn't expecting that voice at all. But it was the \\"Don't break me down...\\" that made me drop what I was doing and just LISTEN...and I was captivated. Even before succumbing to the video I found this song to be liberating, and deserves a solid 9/10.<br /><br />'American' - is not at all bad. The lyrics are silly, but I think it is made up by the arrangement, and displays Lizzy's vocal range. It should be released as a single. 8/10<br /><br />'Cola' - okay, the opening lyrics are a little shocking, but it sets the tone of the song perfectly. Ms Lana is trying to convince a married man that she is worth having an affair for. This song has really grown on me. 7/10<br /><br />'Body Electric' - Silly lyrics aside (Jesus is my bestest friend? What is she, 12?), the song has its moments. Love her voice during the chorus. I don't understand why people pan her voice, because it seems perfect for her material. 6/10 (edit: this is the worst song on the album, as far as I am concerned. )<br /><br />'Blue Velvet' - yes..this is a great song, and her interpretation of it is one of the best I have heard. It shows how much potential Lizzy has with good material, be it her own, or others; I can picture Lana singing this, in a smoke-filled bar, with just a few people listening. Seems like it would fit perfectly into a David Lynch movie. 10/10<br /><br />'Gods and Monsters' - to me this ISLana Del Rey, and it is life. Some of the literal interpretations of this song I have heard are almost comical. The entire song is a metaphor, but it is how she delivers it, that makes it special. With little intonation, she delivers extremely powerful lyrics about growing up and wanting to experience everything there is to experience , and if it is excessive, so be it. I have listened to this song more than any other song I purchased last year. It is brilliant. 10/10<br /><br />'Yayo' - This one is a grower. On first listen I was underwhelmed, but on repeated listenings I have grown to really like it. The reverberation just adds to the mood, and the understated drums and bass, overlayed with strings, creates an ambiance that I have not found elsewhere. 9/10<br /><br />'Bel Air' - My second favorite song on the album. Beginning with children's voices and piano, Lana's alto singing about Gargoyles brings us to a very Cocteau Twins-like chorus, with equally semi-decipherable lyrics. It it is a beautiful love song. 10/10<br /><br />I know that iTunes has an additional song, but I don't think it really fits into the concept of 'Paradise'. This album is near perfect to me, and is EASILY the best musical purchase I made on Amazon in the last few years. Such a delight.
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|Sorry, but pages and pages of ultra-brief, non-sentences just don't do it for me. Be sure you can tolerate this style of writing before diving into this book. I sure could not.
030758836X|5.0|Enjoyed reading this immensely - it was one of those books that I started reading and couldn't put down - I stayed up til 2am, then brought to work with me the next day to read on my lunch break.  Great character development, plot twists, and pacing.  If you enjoy suspense/mystery, you will enjoy reading this nontraditional love story.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Granddaughters so enjoyed  it.  They can watch it over and over on their Kindle.  A very affordable price.  Totally satisfied.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|There is a certain sadism to this box set. Care was taken with every step of production until pressing. So what should have been the greatest case ever for the superiority of vinyl over every other sound medium fails to be made. Don't get me wrong. Where pressings are as quiet and centered as they should be, vinyl wins over CD hands-down. I know because I A/B'd them both at my hi-fi store on state-of-the-art equipment. But where they are marred with noise (which is far too often the case), the records remind you how much we have been spoiled by the quiet of digital sound. These recordings should have been flawless pressings, arguing for the greater density, detail and texture of vinyl sound. But every &#34;tic&#34; and &#34;rumble&#34; just makes you tense with angry disappointment. Don't buy this box. Make EMI apologize to the world for this quality control disaster and reissue the set with every pressing perfect. I'd be willing to pay $30 per pressing (&#34;wholesale&#34;) to hear the Beatles as they must have sounded during original mixing at Abbey Road.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Definitely a different take on the traditional Robin Hood story.  The casting was really unique and enjoyable.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|this knife is by far one of the nicest i have come across. heavy duty, high quality, well worth the price. will last a lifetime or more.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. Read it continuously and finished it in one day.  I tend to read good books that way.  I liked that it was written from the perspective from a dog, so different.  It was a story that made me laugh out loud some times and cry others.  You will love this book!
0394800184|4.0|This was a gift - which was on her &#34;WISH&#34; List. Totally what she wanted and would recommend this product to any &#34;reader&#34;
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have tried other bags, but this one was ordered specifically because of how it loads and stores items.  There are numerous pockets on the inside for documents, and even two pouches on the outside.  Most importantly, the easy open top load system allows me to hold more items than my last bag, which had a bottom area.  Right now I have my camera, 3 lenses, two video cameras, and two battery chargers in the storage area, and still have a few unused section.  Im  a biker photographer, so once I am off my machine, my bag goes on my back or over my shoulder.  This one has extra padding which I appreciate, and wide belly band. Perfect.  Time will tell on its durability, but I like it already.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The first levels are easy.  The next are challenging but doable.  I am sure there will be some ultra hard ones in the later levels.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Ok, I'll admit, I found Ms. Austen's wordiness painful for about 80% of the novel, at which point, I got caught up in the love story, and enjoyed the remainder of the book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yup, can't wait to read the last one. Now I have twelve more words to use so this sentence is fluff.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I enjoyed the first season more  and hate having to pay $1.99 to watch each one of the shows ...too much in my opinion
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is an excellent app for anyone who likes to be orginized. or squeeze as much battery juice as you can before it turns off.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Amazing movie and end to the Christian Bale Batman era. I also think the soundtrack captured every aspect of the movie appropriately.
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW. That was the most intense thing I have ever read in my life. Like oh my goodness gracious! :o
B009JBZH54|5.0|Amazing box set, and an even greater price. Cost of this bluray set was slightly higher than buying just one in bluray.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of his best.  Thank you Nicholas for a great ending as well!  I highly recommend this read.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I thought this season started out a bit slow but by the last show you're hooked and can't wait for season 2!
0143039431|4.0|My mother is 92 years young. This was a gift for her.  She actually remembered being born when some of the events took place!  She enjoyed the book very much although the language was a little strong for her in some places.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love, Love, Love this show!!!  I'm not a zombie fan at all but this show is addicting.  I can't wait to see wait happens!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is good, but the story became a little redundant by the third book in the series. It didn't hold my interest like the other books but I would definitely recommend the whole series. A great love story.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Played this on my computer and it is just as fun and works great on my Kindle Fire.  Worth the $4.99.
B002ZG980U|4.0|This one as well I had to purchase for philosophy class and at first I wasn't sold on this movie, however it is quite interesting. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was completely consumed by this book. I finished it in a little over a day. I couldn't put it down. I was in love with Holden and Sky's relationship from the beginning. I kept feeling like I understood what was going on and then a twist came that I completely wasn't expecting. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this book to anybody!
B00AKO93JK|1.0|Like the other reviewer said, I bought the app, amazon took the money for it, and the app didn't install. I don't know why. I'm upset because it sounded like a good app. Now I need to see if I can get my money back.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I immediately fell in love with Downton Abbey!  This rich period drama is absolutely addictive.  I watched the first and second season in less than a week.<br /><br />First of all, the cinematography is brilliant.  Downton, the home and village the show is set in, is actually filmed at Highclere Castle in Great Britain.  In the midst of WWI, the war scenes are gripping, and most definitely in the same caliber as the rest of the show.  The costumes, slowly evolving as the 1920s style take-over begins.<br /><br />The plot, as dramatic and gripping as ever, thickens as some of our favorite characters go off to war.  The seasons are short by American standards, but at a solid 50 minutes each, I can't complain.  No novel can compare to the sensory overload this beautiful show offers.  It is classic you will want in your personal library.  I recently went back and rewatched season 1, it kept me on the edge of my seat for the second time!  I can't recommend this series enough!
B00008G8LN|4.0|This product arrived ahead of schedule, the quality of the video was very high, I would recommend using this retailer again.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The weather channel is concise , the format is eye catching, usually meets the target of what the weather will be.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I saw similar reviews that reflect my experience. Nickle and diming the user but a fun game none the less.
B005IQZB14|5.0|There's nothing like a story of grit and adventure.  Cheryl's solitary walk north on the Pacific Crest Trail is full of emotion, steadfast resolve, and interesting people.  She has a goal to reach and pain to work through, and she persists through many ups and downs.  Very inspirational true story.
B000002KBU|5.0|Regular CD, new condition, given as a gift for a 50 year old friend.  She was happy, so that is all that matters
B00005UM42|5.0|This may be Brando's finest hour.  Some of the lines are classics--&#34;You scum-suckin' pig&#34;  to Lon, the deputy, for example.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Funny DVD.  Enjoyed it as a Spanish major in Spain.  Very funny scenes for the liberal person.  Subtitles for those that prefer the translation
B0000524CY|5.0|Just as terrifying as the first time around!  Although the effects are clearly a generation old, they are still every bit as effective as the new glitzy ones.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a good read, not as good as I was expecting. Though it flowed very well, rather than being clipped.
B0051RP4DA|5.0|I was never a big Pearl Jam fan but this is fantastic. The ukelele is used in an unexpected way.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|Diana at her best with her sexy sultry voice!  My husband loves her and is happy listening while driving down the road
030759565X|5.0|What can be said of Deb, aka Smitten Kitchen except bravo! BUY THIS BOOK!  Being a major fan of the SmittenKitchen.com website, I have drooled (literally!) over this cookbook.  While I haven't had a chance to try many of the recipes, I did indeed cook the flat roasted chicken with tiny potatoes and Mom's apple cake (and yes, I am now the official apple cake baker/bringer to all future gatherings! Thanks Deb!?) and everything turned out A++.  I love Deb's stories at the beginning of each recipe.  You can't go wrong with this cookbook.  I dropped major hints to both kids at Christmas that this is what I wanted. I love this cookbook and am sure you will to.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|She's been wanting her own copy forever...was a great christmas gift that actually made a teenager smile! Go Johnny Depp
B000CNESU8|5.0|I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.' Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to say, 'I'm a HUMAN BEING, God damn it! My life has VALUE!' So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 'I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!' I want you to get up right now, sit up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell - 'I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!' Things have got to change. But first, you've gotta get mad!... You've got to say, 'I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!' Then we'll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: &#34;I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!&#34;figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: &#34;I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!&#34;
B005LAJ1O0|3.0|Pros:<br />* Really great pilot episode - I was watching it on Netflix, and the pilot alone convinced me to spend the entire day watching the first season of American Horror Story.<br />*The first couple of episodes after that pilot were almost as good as the pilot.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Starting with the pilot episode, there was almost nothing original about this show.  I started naming off horror/creepy films where I'd seen certain plot elements before:  The Amityville Horror (the entire series seems to draw heavily on that movie); many ghost movies of the past couple of decades (&#34;The Others&#34; came to mind, particularly in the case of the ghostly maid who shows up out of nowhere to work for the family); even the Goonies.<br />*I know that this is a hybrid of comedy, horror, and drama, but for me, the drama got to be too much and made the show drag at points; the horror was effective every once in a while, but it seemed like it was maybe toned-down or that the director/writer held-back.  It may have to do with the fact that this was on Fox.  As for the comedy, it was more in the &#34;camp&#34; vein, and I think it actually worked against the horror atmosphere that I feel like the director was trying to achieve more than anything.  The two dead nurses in the house that kept popping up throughout the season really overdid the camp for me, as did the man with the half-burnt body.  His character just seemed really corny/out of place.<br />* Several plot inconsistencies.  For example, some of the deceased in the house appear in the after-life as they did in the moment that they died - as in, spirits who burnt to death appear burnt to a crisp.  However, what doesn't make sense is that other spirits who died in gruesome ways appear completely normal in the afterlife.  Makes absolutely no sense at all to me.  I think it's a really big flaw.<br />* The school shooting scene was really, really off-putting for me.  I think that since the spirits of those killed in theshooting only appear in one scene and never again, their stories not developed any further than the scene in which they were slaughtered, that scene is really unnecessary and just in bad taste.  Not only that, but the shooting scene is played out so that you watch every single person getting shot, one by one.  Really, really insensitive - maybe if there were some sort of message the director/creator was trying to portray that scene would serve a definite purpose, but I honestly feel like that was not the case, that it was just a scene-filler, and that is just wrong.  That one scene almost ruined the series for me.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />The pilot was really great and made me want to watch more.  The next couple of episodes were good, but not as good as the pilot.  Certain scenes made me want to quit watching it, and the ending was okay but expected/just another horror movie spin-off.  By the time I reached the end, I was glad that I watched it on Netflix and didn't buy it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Do listen to the reviews that day this game is addicting! I just started playing for a few minutes and I'm sleepy but I can not so!

B003JTHWJQ|4.0|If you ever wonder about all the arguments that exist to proof the existence of God and how take it from logic, this is the book you need to read.
B007XF0X16|1.0|Dude i rated this 1 star. 1st of all you sent Blu-Ray Case but obviously the disc wasnt Blu-Ray. It was a straight up DVD and not only that but you could see the recording. I know Im all late telling you this, but i just wanted to let you know dude. By the way the you could tell the title of the disc was imprinted on it cause you can even scratch it off
B003TXSF5C|5.0|This book is easy to read and easier to comprehend, i think that it would be a great book for students who try to understand more about our universe and why we are here. A book for everyone.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! It's only fault is that it ends so fast! I like how it's challenging and how it gives you hints. Make more levels! I want more!!!:)
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love it. it very easy to use and very robust and I have already recommended it to my friend  Who has ordered it along with a kindle fire hd.<br />annette
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoy playing most every night. Play before going to sleep. Helps me to get sleepy but very entertaining. One of my favorite games. So glad I found it!
B008KE3960|4.0|This application is a very interesting twist to the usual tower defense. Sometime it can become difficult to handle so many planes at the same time, but that's where a tablet comes in handy :)
B008NEMN0K|2.0|I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics.  It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).<br /><br />I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player.  The disc acts like it is going to load, and then just ejects.  I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time.  I was wrong.  The second one did the exact same thing.<br /><br />Save your time and money and order a normal DVD.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My three year old grandson loved this game. But I didn't get the option to purchase the remaining puzzles. It was easy for him to navigate on his own.
B000002IXS|5.0|.i  do love this product, i have heard other people sing piaf, but ive not enjoyed their covers as much as mireilles.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed the Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey a great deal - and was very happy with the skill of the storyteller.<br /><br />The plot is layered with several &#34;reveal&#34; moments throughout, occasionally turning in directions the reader does not expect. I enjoy speculative fiction about the near future of the human race, but also find this to be well-trodden ground. Mr. Howey manages to find a few fresh paths that are relatively untrampled by other authors.<br /><br />The tale left me pondering the difficulties of herding cats - especially if herding them poorly could end in disaster. Does one fool the cats into going the safest direction, or does one empower the cats to decide which path is right for them?
B008QE9XD2|5.0|A witch turns a man (Barnabas Collins) into a vampire after she was rejected for his affections for another woman.  This is filled with dark humor and is not recommended for children.  This movie, however, is fantastic.  Alice Cooper appears in &#34;present day&#34; 1972.  Barnabas attends the concert by recommendation of his niece.  Alice sings &#34;No More Mr. Nice Guy&#34; and &#34;The Ballad of Dwight Fry&#34;.  When Alice sings &#34;I gotta get outta here, I gotta get outta here, I gotta to get outta here&#34;, that particular part of the song has a significant meaning in the movie.  Only Johnny Depp could have pulled this one off!!!  He had to be the only choice to portray Barnabas Collins.  A MUST HAVE AND MUST SEE!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|As enchanting a story as I remember from childhood. The characters tell of faith overcoming adversity through the challenges of resurrecting the abandoned garden. A marvelous morality story woven throughout a child's bedtime story. All around a great read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Could watch this over and over again.  Very well done.  The stories of each person's life weave together so nicely.
B009RH973I|5.0|I Like the light wheight sleekness of the case. It has met all my expectations and woul recommend it to others
B007SGM084|5.0|A very enlightening book that brought out an ending that was<br /> not expected . Fifty Shades  give you something to think about.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not expecting that! So so so amazing! Once again I was hooked and about to download book 3! Mrs. Anastasia Grey! :)
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I love Mitch Albom's books and I loved this one too. I would have liked to see more information given in the end of maybe some other characters, and I thought even though he was the main character that Dor took up most of the book. Overall a great read once again.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have been playing this game every day since I've downloaded it. It's been fine for the most part but lately it has been freezing up and then telling me I have a slow connection when I don't. Every other app works fine. It would tell me in game to try another room after the slow connection and it would refund me credit that I lost but it hasn't.<br /><br />I wish there was an faq in the settings that would explain the game and what is on the screen when you are in the game room. After you've used up all your credits you aren't able to play again until you can collect your daily credit or buy more.
0684857219|5.0|Got this as one of my workout enthusiast boyfriend's gifts for Christmas, as the reviews all gave it basically two thumbs up and mind you not just amazon.com but other websites as well.  He loves it!! While he was a bit overwhelmed by the thickness of it once he started leafing through the pages and reading here and there his reading and prodding sessions became longer quite quickly!! He tells me on and off how knowledgable and thorough the information in the book is, and how much time it saves him from doing all that research online!! It's his compliments about the book here and there that pushed me to write this review, I know he actually is pleased with it vs telling me he likes it because I got it for him as a gift lol. Don't listen to the negative reviews about this book and look at the average ratings and amount of reviews!! My boyfriend's always a &#34;yeah its pretty good&#34; kind of a guy and even he's quite pleased with it!<br />OH but be warned if getting this as a gift: do NOT get gift wrapping option!! When i received it the wrapping looked as if someone had tried to open it and then shoved it into the cardboard box before sending it out!! It was ripped and barely hanging onto the book! I was horrified and had to wrap it myself again!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I liked a lot the first book, so I really expected a lot of the second one.<br />All the kinky mood is almost lost for the love story...it's like Cinderella but with sex.<br />I really like love stories, buy there are many other authors that do it better, like Cecelia Ahern.<br />I'm still thinking about reading the third book...with this one, sometimes I felt I was losing my time...
B004LWZWGK|4.0|First let me say this is a review of the movie and the Blu Ray combo.  UltaViollet is horrible.  New way for the Hollywood machine to screw you over.<br /><br />If you want the digital copy buy it on Amazon in HD.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I have found that it is much easier to play this game on the AARP website which I fortunately found
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I really gave this book a shot.  It dragged on and on.  Also, I don't think it helped that I am reading this after seeing Tom Cruise in the movie.  The two characters are physically very different.<br /><br />Some of the material was a bit cliche, not much new.  One Shot was better.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I have not yet found a solitaire game that is easy and enjoyable to play so I play from the AARP web site.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This is the modern Eastwood picture.  Great movie, great characters (even Timberlake).  Sometimes you just want to watch a movie and root for the good guys.  This is it.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I had not read this book for many years and really enjoyed it.  Has been one of the few books I got on my Kindle successfully.
B005T87QCI|4.0|I like the game but there is one problem.you cant make your own robots like you can on an apple product
B000JMLFLW|2.0|In trying to get books imported to my newly-purchased Kindle, this one made it to the Kindle but was not really a title I wanted.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|excelente precio, y con una muñeca incluida, nada mas que decir que fue una excelente compra este regalo para la navidad
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I have always adore Clint Eastwood and all his pictures, but this one is horrible.  It is a slow moving movie and it just is bad, don't waste the $4.00
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Not quite finished reading it yet but look forward to picking it up every day. A heart warming and also gut wrenching story of Love and Loss from the dogs viewpoint.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Very cute, Josh Brolin does a great job as K, He even looks like a young K, who would they get for a young J in Men in Black 4
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Cute and fun game for all ages. Keeps you entertained for hours and coming back for more and more.<br />Love watching the kids play.
B001706I5I|5.0|I just simply adore this movie. It's a classic Christmas tale, with an edgy undertone. Most importantly, the message is a must-hear/see as well. Definitely worth any money the Blu-ray costs!
0375413405|5.0|This awesome cookbook that walks you through the often difficult recipes previously untranslated. It might be a bit much for people who have no experience in cooking at all, but if you are at least interested in cooking this is a great buy! You might find yourself buying dutch ovens, newer knives, and a decent cutting board soon, so be prepared!<br /><br />This cookbook got a bit more popular after the movie came out, but don't let the recent interest let you think it's anything less than a masterpiece.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lot's of great recipes, descriptions and instructions for everyday items and processes, reasonably priced, well written.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None. Buy this book!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Really enjoyed it! So much so that I read the next one which is a novella..Thank so much, keep writing!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|If you liked the movie, you will love the album. The highlights are great, and it is just like reliving it from the theatre.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I enjoyed Cut The Rope so, I decided to give this game a chance. It hasn't disappointed. The graphics are wonderful.  The game is unique and entertaining.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I knew about his work but not about the man.  What an amazing man.  His book is honest without guile!  He truly understood what was important and pointed out the foolish ideas about life and human behavior.  His brain was not wired like most of the population...and that was the gift of evolution and a father that encouraged questions.  Every once in while evolution produces a mind Like Dr Feynman's. Too bad the odds of repeating this evolutionary gift is not on a larger scale.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This was a purchase for my wife, but I have gotten quite involved with the show as well.  The show is excellent, the Blu-ray package with extras and packaging and all is also a good value.  I recommend it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I'm stuck on a level, can't sean to get past it but I keep trying so I must enjoy the game itself
B009JZVT70|5.0|Love the show - Great for kids - we did have an issue streaming episode 2, but episode 1 was fine.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|She has me send her gifts (on the game) everyday. Not sure I would play otherwise but I believe it would be great for say someone younger in age or at heart.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a funny story, it had its up and downs.  I could see me telling a friend about this story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a one of a kind app. so many different games and strategy combinations providing hours and hours of entertainment. cannot get enough!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|When you thought you read all you can about Pendergast, they come up with something new and exciting.  I have enjoyed all their books and particularly love the Pendergast series.  Cannot wait for the next one
B005LAIH9A|5.0|I chose this because I enjoyed the first two movies.  My friend recommended this to me and it was worth the wait.  I never laughed so hard.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great fun - can't wait for the third installment. Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law are a great combo in a well written script
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game it isn't even funny.  Simple to use and understand.  A mindless game that is hard to put down.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is clear and easy to understand. It takes you step by step through the whole process of preparing and loading your first book. After that, it is pretty easy.
B002U3CCF6|3.0|I looked forward to reading this novel, but instead of enjoying it, I'm left with an odd taste in mouth. I don't mind dark & macabre tales, in fact, I enjoy them. But Gillian Flynn's writing is strangely detached, almost unemotional. Despite being written in the first person, from the mouth of the character whose family around her are turning out to be more & more twisted, I wasn't drawn in to her world at all. In fact, in numerous places I had to hold myself back from skipping ahead. Unfortunately, I can't quite put my finger on what is missing. Maybe it's that the characters aren't developed enough, or maybe it's that the narrator tries to convey her emotion by listing off the words she has cut into herself, rather than describing her actual emotions. Either way, I understand this is Flynn's first book, so I'm hopeful her story crafting skills improve in her later efforts.
1594135851|1.0|From Gladiator to the Running Man, the idea of humans being forced to fight to the death for entertainment is so horrific that it rarely fails as a fiction genre, and though underwhelming, the Hunger Games just about managed to pull it off and offered enough intrigue to tempt me into the sequel.<br /><br />Sadly, Catching Fires not only fails dismally, but also ruins the strengths of the original novel. The story has so much potential, but rather than get immersed in the events, one merely finds oneself groaning at the poor quality of the writing. Collins' biggest sin is her failure to upheed the most essential quality of good fiction. Show, don't tell. On page after page she tells us about Katliss' feelings for Gale, Peeta, Prim, but very little ever happens that draws us into these emotions and makes them real. Simply writing \\"then she kissed Peeta\\" every ten pages or so is simply not enough to draw us into her inner struggles.<br /><br />One prime example is how tells us that her make-up crew speak of the Hunger Games more from how it affected their own lives than from any empathy with the children being killed. The dialogue should be enough to make the reader understand this, but it is not. The failure to convey the terror and injustice of the arena was poor in the original, in book two it barely exists. It feels like a Famous Five novel, padded out with constant descriptions of Katliss' costumes, make-up, hairdos, all the time failing to depict the grotesqueness of what is happening.<br /><br />Collins simply doesn't seem to understand her subject material. The fact District 12 folk don't go into the mines until they are 18 shows that she doesn't even understand the hardships people face in the world we live in today, let alone in the post-acopalypic world she is trying to present. As they weave watertight containers out of reeds and fill them with a streaming supply of sap from trees, while feasting on berries and game shot in the woods as if picked off a supermarket trolley, it is evident that Collins has no idea what real wilderness survival is all about.<br /><br />She also makes a complete mess of her main character. Katliss had so much potential in book one, but she has now turned stupid beyond belief. At one point, the apparent symbol of the revolution is mulling over killing Johanna and thinks she \\"might just kill her to shut her up.\\" The way she shows so little remorse for the deaths she albeit unwillingly causes makes her one of the most unlikable characters in the book. But let's not blame Katliss. Blame Collins for her hopeless ineptitude at describing human emotion or depicting real tragedy.<br /><br />Page after page of dross written by a woman who clearly has no real understanding of cruelty, hopelessness, starvation, addiction or violence - themes that are dealt with so trivially in this book that I was left with nothing but disappointment. Digust not at the horrors endured by the people of Panem, but at the shallowness of the way the author presents them. After book one, I was eager to learn more about the world Collins had created. By the end of book two, I longer believed in it. I didn't believe in Katliss, Peeta, the Hunger Games or the Capitol any more. In good fiction, you feel drawn into the characters and their imagined universe, and they become real. In Catching Fire you can feel this feeling slipping away with every page as it becomes more and more evident that this is just a story that somebody is making up. And frankly not doing a very convincing job of it...rmarket trolley, it is evident that Collins has no idea what real wilderness survival is all about.<br /><br />She also makes a complete mess of her main character.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I got interested in the first book, but the second book is even better.  More of a plot and character development
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have a doggie and this book helped me see and understand how he feels ,his ears and eyes...this is a wonderful book!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Though the storyline was a bit easy to figure out, I liked the connection between J and K. Of course the effects were great as always.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing story!  I read the book in one day, just COULD NOT put it down! I can't stop thinking about the book - yet it's like it hasn't sank in yet. I have no words other than it's just utterly amazing and blew me away!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Blasted through all of my expectations. Excellent tale, well directed and well acted. Not a huge Jamie foxx fan but he was superb in this role. All actors, scenes were above average and superb.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read all the books in this series and was very disappointed in this one.  I kept reading hoping it would get better.  DeMille definitely puts a great deal of detail in his books but this one had way too much.  I found myself speed reading through countless pages.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I like.solving puzzles and finding the missing items throughout the boards a really fun puzzle and clue game def should try
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I was looking forward to the release of this book for 9 months and then when I read it I was a little disappointed.  It definitely had the twist and thrills that this series offers but in parts of the book it was like the authors were trying to get the word count up by endless detail that really was not important.
0920236162|5.0|My adult daughter loves this book.  Partly because we used to read it to her when she was a child.  She grew up in Canada and this Canadian author is very popular there, as well as other parts of the world.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|That's the best possible way I could describe this film. A lot of the better jokes are used up in the trailer, but the film is funny enough on its own to carry through.<br /><br />If you want a complex plot with opaque characters, this isn't your type of movie. This isn't a movie where a plot was well-developed and jokes ensued--it's almost like jokes were written and a plot was developed around them. You couldn't get more transparent characters than \\"wears thick eyeliner, nobody understands her and she totally like distances herself off, total artist but her dad is soo meaaan\\" (aka, the main character).<br /><br />That being said, for mild slapstick humor (think: punching, rolling around in vomit) and witty dialogue (mostly from \\"Fat Amy\\" and the Treblemakers lead) it's funny. Just FYI, the movie does take a serious note as it progresses--this isn't your Will Ferrell laugh-throughout-the-whole-film comedy.<br /><br />(Friedberg and Seltzer are the duo who brought you \\"Scary Movie\\", \\"Disaster Movie\\", \\"Date Movie\\", etc)
1601254679|5.0|I love this one for the ease of use.  Need an NPC now? It's in here.  Need a character for the new guy? It's in here.  The builds are solid, the art is Paizo standard, which is to say amazing.  I really hope that they do a second volume with builds from the other rule books. All the characters in here are built from the core rule book only, so it is easily used by just about anyone.  Highly recommend.
0060254920|5.0|The book was packaged properly with TLC. I'm thankful I got it before xmas as well as in tiptop shape.
B009G5TWFO|5.0|This is by far the best epic movie of all time (along with Braveheart). It has good history (granted some things are inflated to make the movie...a movie and not a documentary). It has great action and excellent special effects. The storyline is also top notch.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|The stand up portion does not hold my Kindle like I hoped it would. The case is very durable and has protected my Kindle above my expectations.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I couldn't believe I actually liked this movie.  I was surprised and laughed my you know what off!  Definately not for kids!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know people say you should read the book first. That the books are always better but for me I love seeing the movie first and falling in love with the story line first and then diving into the book and going deeper into it. Because everyone knows they always leave the best parts out of the movie.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I love all these movies....I couldn't wait to see this one.  Maybe my expectations were a little too high, but I was disappointed.  I didn't think there was enough action like the others.  I had some unanswered questions.  You see some returning characters but not the ones I wanted to see.  I thought even Milla's action scenes were a little flat.  However, I will say based upon the ending, the next one looks like it might make up for this one.
B007UR1OHO|3.0|Acting was good, story was good, ending was not so good.. Not as good as the notebook, but then again not as bad as Dear John.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Of course we loved this movie when we saw it on the big screen.  We knew we we would want to include it in our personal collection.
B00122J1AU|5.0|I love the Polar Express movie and the soundtrack its one of my favorite movies I could watch over and over and the animations are so realistic.....................
B0034G4P8A|5.0|We loved this movie when we saw it on the big screen and were excited to acquire it when it came out for sale.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Purchased this movie for the kids during the holidays. They love it, and they can follow along the Batman series. They really enjoyed it.
B00367XA1K|5.0|Reds is a beautiful film about interesting people during a critical time in history. Acting is stellar. Totally absorbing. One of my top ten favorite films.
1457514508|3.0|This book had a cast of some very interesting characters, and definitely twists and turns that were absolutely not anticipated. One thing I particularly and thoroughly enjoyed was the environmental atmosphere that was present in almost all portions of the book. But most especially notable was the descriptions of Argentina and Paris. I've never been to Argentina, but I absolutely wanted to, after reading this. I have personally also been to Paris, so I was grinning all the while through the descriptions of the cafes, and the entertaining yet idiotic mannerism of Kelly's \\"adventure\\" as a model.. But in Paris, it does seem like it would be possible, but it was absolutely fascinating later on when they discover who the \\"Count\\" is, and what his background really and truly is.... Honestly, every single character was something they weren't, which was fascinating in itself. Though at the end, I didn't feel as though everything had been resolved, and it was completed a bit too tidily for my tastes, though i DID appreciate the twist that occurred at the very end.<br /><br />The negatives in this book were that I believe there were too many instances of repetition that could have been eliminated- I understood most of the goals behind the repetition (setting up the scene, then later 'picking it up', descriptive monologues in the interior of the characters' minds) but I did feel as though the oft-occurring repetition was truly not necessary, that there could have been much better ways to deal with that. And it wasn't clear who wanted the person who did die, dead..  It was interesting, the twists and turns, just the repetition involved and some of the characters' depths were questionable, some situations slightly unbelievable, but still probable... Overall it was a decent story line but could have been written and edited slightly better...  It's a fair tale, and enjoyable passage of time, however!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|In my opinion this game is the bomb. It has cool graphics and a bunch of stuff you can collect. I recommend this game to gamers
0345536886|4.0|I am reading it currently and enjoying the subtle humor and suspense. I will read and leave a detailed review soon.<br /><br />When you have a chance, please check my new book in Amazon using the link below:<br />Afghan Chai by Ayaz S.K.<br />http://www.amazon.com/AFGHAN-CHAI-ebook/dp/B009UVQ9HI
B0068FYZCA|5.0|Excellent! My daughter loved it. We all watched it after opening our gifts Christmas morning. May become our new tradition.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|We gave this to our grandaughter as a Christmas present to go with the Kindle Fire we gave her.  She loves it and says it is easy to find because of the color.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was disappointed...the Harry potter books was so inventive and this was like a poor true romance novel..so bland with little depth to characters..and no one I would ever really want to know...
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I just enjoyed this movie so much.  It is such a &#34;feel good&#34; movie.  The four main characters are wonderful with Eli Walic's roll be one of the best.  A glimpse of what the old Hollywoood must have been like.  The scenes in England made me want to go back soon..
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I already know I'll read this again just because of the way it's written and the language. You have to pay attention. I could picture young Dell Parsons.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|The girls loved  it  and watched it as a marathon.  I would suggest this series to anyone who wants to laugh.
B006LSZECO|3.0|First third of novel excellent, then it became contrived, wordy and boring - thought I had found a novel worth reading - back to nonfiction.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great series, very funny, great quality programming.  The boys make my kids laugh and they have watched over and over.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|what can I say I have always loved Fishdom, just wish the game had more levels so could play longer, its always over way too quick.
B009B4ZEMA|5.0|I love Christinas voice, all the songs were great. There wasn 't  one I didn't like. I also like the songs with Celo and Blake.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|was pretty fun once I learned the game, feel like I am abusing my poor kindle when I play it though! but its fun, lots of action and great for the colors.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|No wonder this book has become a hit tv series. Juicy secrets, scandalous lies, murder....and so much more. Can't wait to read the next installment of this very addictive series.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Fun, fast moving, lots of challenges, endless levels, I really enjoy this game, can play it for a long time before getting bored.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Amazing. Book changed my whole out Look on Life. I have the Power. Thank Thank Thank. I pray God continue to Bless you too Right more Books. Second to the Bible this is my Second Choice. Thank as o much Life will never the same again it's Going to Get Better &Better Thanks to my New Out Look on Life.
B00631HASU|5.0|I enjoy the game very much, little hard to play on my kindle fire due to the sensitivity to touch. I ended up flinging marbles to all kinds of places!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good but can you add armour I have iron just sitting around it is totally fun lolz the best tots.worth the $ 7.00
0312360258|5.0|This book arrived to me in great condition. It was on time. There was no marks or bends on the book at all. Thank you again.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Always wonderful, great to have it on Kindle. A storyline that never dates and so good too read rather than listen to. Thank you Amazon and Victor Hugo.
B00243FQFA|5.0|After seeing the first four seasons and just have to get the fifth season! This series is generally very family friendly: limited language and limited sexuality. There is, as with most sci-fi, some violence, however, next to no blood or gore. Great series!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|The Master has done it again.  A wonderful Rebus return, with Fox in there as well. Just when we thought Rebus had gone forever here he is again with all his faults and funny ways.  Wonderful descriptions of the Scottish East Coast, a really good read.
0984999302|5.0|I gave it 5 stars since the content is the best I have found so far about Startups and it complements very well with other materials you find online from the same author.<br /><br />However, my complain: the Kindle version has NO PAGE NUMBERING.. hellooooo.<br /><br />Apart from that, pure pills of new biz wisdom.<br /><br />Congrats to the writer and supporters.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I. Have read every  book but this one is best<br /> Out of all I am really excited to see what is next for Greg heffley
1451695195|5.0|Very good. Should give non-beleavers something to think about. I sent the book to other's to read. Read it, you will like it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was amazing! The suspense throughout the book was impeccable and I always had a great time reading it. Anything I did not like was the last chapter was a little confusing. But overall I really enjoyed reading Catching Fire!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|At first I was unsure if I wanted to spend this much but I took a chance and it was well worth it. You could easily spend 50 or more hours on this game. The controls work well and the game has no lag. Make sure you have enough space for the game though. I am happy I made this purchase.
B00006AW2S|5.0|A great batch of hard rock featuring several self-penned tunes by the guys along with their usual brilliant covers. Spider and the Fly is flawless.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good follow up to The Hunger Games. A lot of twists I didn't see coming. Going to jump right into the third. My fingers are crossed for Peeta. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games then you will definitely enjoy Catching Fire.
B0093URN4E|5.0|Converge's eighth full-length from the studio finds the Salem-based quartet basically picking up where they left off on 2009's \\"Axe To Fall.\\" Indeed, Ought-twelve's \\"All We Love We Leave Behind\\" does not feature the same small army of guest musicians and vocalists that \\"Axe\\" had, but it is still a fairly experimental release in that it alters tempos and makes room for a surprisingly large amount of song-by-song variety. But before you get too upset, let me point out that Converge's sound is, at its core, still basically the same -- you've got the drummer blasting the crap out of his trapkit while Kurt Ballou lays down some extremely tricky riffs, and Nate Newton some very muscular and angular bass lines. And, of course, the band's hard/mathcore sound is augmented by a wealth of crazed time signatures, tempo changes, and mathematically-calculated rhythms. Furthermore, they hit some near grindcore-worthy speeds and intensities along the way.<br /><br />\\"All We Love...\\" begins on a bit of an experimental note, with \\"Aimless Arrow\\" boasting a booming, doom-soaked guitar and bass riff, as well as some typically excellent drumming from the album's M.V.P., Ben Koller. This tune, the opener, is also of note for its astonishingly melodic/tuneful and wailing vocals. \\"Trespasses\\" soon follows this up, however, with a brutal and thunderous wall-of-sound anchored by humming bass lines and punishing double-kick drums. And, of course, Jacob Bannon is heard screaming over the top of the mix screaming his lungs out with visceral, atonal bellowing. And \\"Tender Abuse\\" completes the one-two-punch knockout of tracks two and three, and does so with a wealth of more really excellent (and superbly dexterous) drumming.<br /><br />\\"Sadness Comes Home\\" is not a very long song, clocking in at only three minutes and change, but it is nonetheless a friggin' epic. It is highlighted by complex structuring and varied guitar work -- it even goes so far as to dip into a little bit of fleeting guitar soloing. Some of the more noteworthy experimental moments include \\"Empty On The Inside,\\" which is propelled by the rhythm section (with martial drum fills and strong, grumbling bass lines); and \\"Glacial Pace\\" and \\"Coral Blue\\" (both of which begin with a slow-burning, and almost purely doom/shoegaze metal intros and ominous vocals -- the latter of these two songs features some Ministry-esque singing -- before graduating into abrasive, serrated riffing and dissonant hardcore screams.) Then, of course, one must not forget to mention the terrifically foreboding instrumental interlude (\\"Precipice\\"), and the epically epic thirteenth track, the title song.<br /><br />But back in Kansas again, there is plenty of more familiar-sounding stuff, here, that is sure to satisfy all old-school fans. For example, \\"Sparrow's Fall\\" is a frantic and brutal number that evokes Converge's \\"Petitioning The Empty Sky\\" era, with its raw-throated, larynx-stretching screams, bludgeoning guitars, and machine gun-fast drumming. \\"Vicious Muse\\" features a bouncy drum into before morphing into catchy hardcore chugging and rhythmic, punk-inflected drumming. And elsewhere, \\"Veins And Veils\\" has a mid-tempo and grumbling bass intro before a fast tempo change kicks in, rocketing the song into breakneck picking and blasting. And rounding out the set, \\"Shame In The Way\\" is an up-tempo hardcore chugger with memorable vocal patterns that plays like a concise and compact kick to the head. And the closing \\"Predatory Glow\\" backs huge, hefty, pounding chugga-chugga riffs and thunderously booming power chords with crashing cymbals and a gang-shouted refrain.<br /><br />All told, \\"All We Love We Leave Behind\\" mixes just the right amount of new-ish-sounding elements into Converge's usual, unbridled metal-tinged math/hardcore assault. The end result is a standout in the band's discography, and one of the year's finest extreme metal records (and, not to mention, doubtlessly 2012's best hardcore release). It is an easy album to love, and one that should definitely NOT be left behind!asy album to love, and one that should definitely NOT be left behind!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I did not watch Season 1, so when Season 2 was advertised I purchased Season 1 to see if this was something I would care to continue with and YES!!!  The costume's, the presentation, the characters.  You want to sit and watch it through completely!!!!!  Season 2 was wonderful.  I can hardly wait to sit and watch Season 3....You can't help but feel you are a part of what is going on!!!  The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The dresses for the ladies are outstanding!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The double perspective point of view just didn't ring true. The male perspective seemed tainted by a woman's negative impressions of men.  I could not stop reading that into Nick's point of view.  However, Gone Girl is extremely readable and I enjoyed the process of turning pages.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|The series is wonderful, has a grand story, but the music is GRAND!  This 1st season CD music tops all I have ever heard.  I am looking forward to the publication of ALL the songs that were left out of the 1st season, plus the 2nd season in its entirety.  Once again the Musice speaks for itself as well as the series!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I loved this book. I thought the structure of the novel was brilliant, the writing was vivid, and the characters were so thoroughly and wonderfully drawn that each of the separate episodes could have stood on its own as a great short story. My only disappointment, and the reason I did not give it five stars, was that at the end of the book, the reader was left wondering what the carefully and lightly drawn connection between the stories was all about. At least I was left wondering. In any event, I heartily recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a works of art that hits every feeling of emotion. Such a great read... looking forward to rest of trioloy.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This book is valuable as a first-hand account of one of the most important military operations of our generation. The story is well told and of course I salute the courage and patriotism of the men and women who carried out this operation. That said, however, I think this is a 10 page magazine article that was turned into a book. A lot of the detail and background seemed gratuitous. Even with all the extra padding, it is still a short book, so it's worth the time it takes to read it.
B001NHNG64|2.0|I've seen the movie and wanted to read the books.  The 2nd book is extremely tedious and the violence is over the top.  I can only hope the series gets better and that the author stops with all the shrugs!  Every person in the book shrugs all the time, every page.  There must be another physical movement other than a shrug the author can use as a response to a situation, statement, etc.  Not sure I'm continuing after this book.
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|Joe and Beth make a super team.  They have some very special versions of covers here that bring a fresh new perspective to the tunes.  Love the entire album!
B009CF7GRY|1.0|Horrible!  If you loved the original like I did back in the 80's this will be like hearing your favorite songs put to elevator music.  They turned it from a movie with rebels and rock songs into a country/urban music video.  Wish I could give it zero stars.
0061906220|5.0|I'm a preschool teacher in NYC and my students LOVE Pete the Cat!!! I think Eric Litwin is brilliant. His books are educationally superb (color recognition, number recognition, counting, etc). Pete is the perfect preschool roll model -- he's cool, he's chill, goodness no he doesn't cry! The youtube videos are hilarious! Wish the songs were on iTunes!
B004PYDBEO|4.0|This book was enjoyable to read.  It presented some new ideas that help to understand what to expect from the market and how to better judge risk.  It points out a lot of issues with the math behind many of the current market tools used by Morningstar and other financial services.<br /><br />In the end it does not provide much insight into making money in the market.  I have started utilizing the concept that volatility clusters to help time purchases.  And it strengthened the concept that price changes have historical dependencies.<br /><br />The biggest benefit is to better understand how to protect your principal.  The book it very defensive, but as long as you keep your principal, you can always get in on the next uptrend.  That's much better than waiting for a large loss to recover.
B0086700CM|3.0|I wish I was better at playing this game. The graphics are cute, but the game creates anxiety for me.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Very moving and reality based even if the concepts seem far off. The Somni story was my favorite.  Better than the movie.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|OK, so what is not to like?  Pixar focuses it's remarkable talents on a tale of a young princess (natch) growing up in medieval Scotland.  Since it is Disney, you know that there will be an attempt at a heart-warming message.  The plot itself is rather linear - girl is special, girl rebels, girl causes problem, girl fixes problem.  The positive message is one of taking action to control ones existence, but understanding the effect of your actions on others.  Merida is another strong willed Disney heroine.<br /><br />What is great is the comic undertone of the entire movie, the supporting characters, other than the serious mother, are uniformly hilarious.  Most scenes display a humorous whimsey that wins you over, from the clan chieftans to Merida's little brothers (always after baked goods).  The animation is great, with wonderful landscapes, animals, and, of course, Merida's fire red hair.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My son got this for Christmas and absolutely LOVES it.  It's his favorite toy and plays with it several times a day.  It's amazingly authentic in detail - doors open, hood opens, mirrors fold, dumper opens & raises, suspension is active, and made of very good quality.  I am sold on Bruder products and will purchase some myself for my son in the future.  I expect that this will take a good beating, likely chipping and likely even breaking some pieces off (he is 2 after all and likes to crash it ALOT), but expect that he will have it for a LONG LONG time.  Great product overall.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|brilliant book,i couldn't put it down.it was a very interesting read with a great story line.i cant wait for the next one :)
1451696191|2.0|I have been hearing rave reviews about this book for a couple years now, and always had interest in reading it.<br />This Christmas, I received the book as a gift and was excited to start it to find out what all the hype was about.<br />To say the book was a complete letdown is an understatement.<br />I have read quite a few books that start out slow but peak my interest somewhere in the middle.<br />This book, however...did not fall into that category. As I turned the pages, I was crossing my fingers for a climactic event...SOMETHING<br />to make me invested in the story...but it NEVER happened!<br />I found Charlie to be so unintentionally unlikable, and the story itself to be so mundane and bland. Every time Charlie cried, I wanted to<br />reach through the pages and slap him (you should never want to do such a thing to a \\"protagainist\\" !)<br />When I was finally finished with the book, I felt robbed. I felt like the victim of an overhyped, yet underwhelming trend.<br />Sorry to say, Perks Of Being A Wallflower lands itself on my \\"Top 5 Least Favorite Books I Have Ever Read\\" list.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|The product itself is good. The diet works if you can stick to it, which I could not after about a month. But it helped me jump start my weight loss so it was worth it.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|I might be easily entertained, but I think this flick is worth a watch. The story is pretty good and it has some notable actors. Plus Taylor Kitsch isn't bad to watch shirtless for a hour.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It is Lady Gaga, of course it rocks! I put this album on my computer, mp3 player, and cell phone.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Really enjoyed this. Far better and way different than the previous Total Recall! Colin Farrell is a great action hero and Kate Beckinsale kicks you know what. The special effects are good, but don't over power the story.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|It is Lady Gaga, need I say more? The album is great quality and awesome enough to listen to daily.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|Nice little set but could of been better but a must for Bowie fans. This is a great cd  and I recommend
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Yes, you need to keep the lid open to recharge the kindle (otherwise you need to put the camera on the left side). But, this design ensures the case to prevent dust from damaging HDMI and power ports in most of the time when you do not recharge the kindle. My kindle fits in the case very well and is able to stand in different angles depending my needs. Good quality and looks neat!
B002JM1VJG|4.0|Bought for my wife and she big fan so she enjoyed it very much and recommends it to any Madonna fan
B004N66XYE|5.0|OH, THE ENGLISH. HOW WELL THE WEALTHY LIVED. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE PART OF THAT WORLD IF ONLY FOR A DAY.
B002ZFQD04|4.0|Bought for my wife and she a huge fan . She liked it very much and would recommend to any fan
B008FYZIVY|5.0|THIS SERIES TRANSPORTS THE VIEWER TO ANOTHER, MORE WONDERFUL WORLD. I WOULD WANT TO BE MORE THAN A FLY ON THE WALL. I WANT TO BE A CRAWLEY!
B002X9W50E|4.0|A must for a Bowie fan. good live album but not his best but still a must own so buy it.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|What more can I say? Seriously addictive! Kept me up until 2 am when I downloaded it! 7 am meeting too!
B004U52VPS|3.0|My son likes this but it is nothing special and cheap looking. Comes with some blocks and some birds and a launcher along with cards. The birds don't launch to well off launcher so it adds to the difficulty. Can be frustrating to young children. Pieces fly when hit and works best on A hard surface
B0000VCZKM|5.0|A wonderful movie, great for all ages and this one in very good shape.  A great Christmas gift for sure to my 3-year old grand daughter.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Loved this book!!  Will take you on a emotional roller coaster but it is a must read!! Loved Layken and Will
B005NJU8PA|4.0|A bit over the top, author goes off on tangents in great detail and kind of loses you if you are not into whatever he decides to discuss. Seems his mind is very &#34;stream of conscious&#34; and book reveals that aspect of the author but overall an enjoyable read. Recipes would seem to be not to everyone's taste.  He could have stuck to more mainstream dishes but I guess he wanted to stress the &#34;chef&#34; aspect of your learning lessons. I enjoyed the real life tips he put in the book. Who knows when I will need to tie a strong knot.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is something for everyone!  Lots of fun to play!  Puzzles keep you thinking and drawing ability not required!  Had fun creaing my own stick people and putting them through the adventures!
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Savages is a brutally entertaining story about a drug cartel from Mexico imposing its will on independent pot produces in California. The acting is great and the scenes of violence and brutality are horrifically portrayed.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great acting, great directing and a super story line all add up to a masterpiece of of the video arts!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Same solitaire, the only difference is that when you begging a play it asks you if you would like a winning or a random deal. I think they should not ask. I would always like to have a chance of winning or at least that the game would always deal randomly. The only other thing is that when I touch a card it moves automatically and it sometimes does not go to the card I wanted or it will give me a better play taking some of the fun of playing. I have tried spider solitaire from MobilityWare also and I love it. Its the same thing, same problems for me but overall the apps are easy and simple to use.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I recommend this book to everybody, I don't have words to say thank you to the Universe for this experience and to Anita to have the courage to share this with all of us.  Blessings
B0096CDG0O|5.0|The instructions for the game suck. I was so confused when I first tried the app. Once I got the hang of it though I loved it. Its more of a strategy game combined with luck. the only bad thing is that you can buy more rolls of the dice making it a little unfair if the other player has a better score because of that. Even still this is my go to app when I need to kill time.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My four year old grandson loves to play this with me. He's better at it than me. Great for teaching problem solving skills.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is AWESOME!!!! :D I thank the creators of this amazing and addicting game. I've played this app for many months since I got a kindle fire and have enjoyed it every time. I LOVE the graphics and the upgrades in the app. I suggest this app could be for anyone who loves adventure and survival games!! I will be continuing to use this app forever!!! :) I hope everyone who plays enjoys this app!! ;)
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Sorry, but this was rubbish.<br />I love a good mummy porn book but this was just too much. I skipped all the sex bits and was left with nothing.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The only thing I hate is that Christian Bale will no longer be Batman. he has been the best one ever played and the story lines that Christopher Nolan has come up with are great.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Best episode from the best show on TV. The Walking Dead is a phenomenal drama that has so many human emotions running through it. The characters are so well rounded and you feel yourself being drawn to them and truly caring for them.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Love this movie. It follows the book by Nicholas Sparks really well. I loved how logan's character was portrayed in this film. They couldn't have gotten a better actor for it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Recipient loved the item and has shared with several others. I would definitely recommend this to others.  Received promptly as ordered.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Love Robert Duvall in this film. I cried like a baby when.... well better not say or I'll give the movie away. It is awesome. a must watch.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game rocks this game is so fun if you like cut the rope than you will like this game even more.
B005LAIISA|5.0|If you bought this for your kids plan on watching it about 12 times in the next month. I bought it for my nephews and neice for christmas (I have 6 nephews and a neice.) It came in on Dec. 21st and I've already watched it 5 or 6 times. It is really a GREAT movie and will have you laughing even after the 6th time you've seen in two weeks!
1603427244|5.0|This book is great for multiple cast on and bind off techniques.  The techniques are illustrated in color and the instructions are very easy.  I am a visual person and the book was easy to follow.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I liked the idea that 2 generations of women went seeking their roots. One out of longing and the other out of love.
1596680296|5.0|I've looked at a few different sock books and this book gives very basic step by step instructions for knitting socks.  I am a visual person, so I have difficulty following written instructions.  The wording and photos made me think, I can knit some socks!!  This is a great book because not only are there different patters for cool looking socks, but the instructions are easy enough for beginners.  Awesome book!
B00480OHWK|5.0|My son enjoyed this book and read aloud for us to hear .  I remember reading  this book as a kid.
B000SGRONM|1.0|Not at all what I expected, very negative - expected more since I had read the sample. Wouldn't recommend at all.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|A lot of hype...it was just okay...I would recommend reading something else. Don't get me wrong, there were some good parts, the end wasn't one of them.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the weather channel. I am a farmer and my husband and I do a lot of camping, so we always keep an eye on the weather.I like the format, it is easy to use.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This American Dictionary is the best resource for your word search need this book is good for all ages i would recommend this book to those who need help with difficult word
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A perfect ending to a perfect series! Way to go Suzanne Collins!<br />Couldn't have ended the book in a better way!
1449410243|5.0|Something about this book just tickles the living daylight out of my Funnybone. I read some of the pages and just laugh and laugh.<br />If you have a strange sense of humor you will enjoy this book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I HATE IT. IT DISTRACTS ME, KEEPS ME FROM WORK, AWAKE AT NIGHT  AND IT CHEATS JUST LIKE THE REAL THING....
1452110581|5.0|Really loved this book, gave it to my daughter, she has four cats and volunteers at a cat shelter. She felt she would be buying the book for some of her friends, she liked it so much.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I got this for my husband (a die-hard Potterhead) for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. We have found it easy to program and easy to use. We don't have cable TV, so we used the actions to do volume, turn the TV on and off, and switch between our various gaming consoles. It's definitely impressive and our houseguests seem to love it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I liked the show and already had season one, two, and three so I bought season to complete the set
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Keep on Lying reminds me of a song by The Mothers of Invention, America Drinks and Goes Home, because of the laughter and voices.  Mothers song more sinister in nature.  I'm 58 but Tame Impala is cause for rejoicing.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The plot is so convoluted I won't even TRY to go into it here.  Suffice to say you will be bowled over by the acting in this series.  Claire Danes, Damien Lewis, Mandy Patikin, et al, are statlingly magical in the way they play their characters.  You care about them, so much so that that you are committed to watching EVERY week to see what happens to these people you've grown to care about.  And you will!  I feel sorry for those that buy the whole series at once.  It's like eating cashews, you won't know when to stop watching... So hunker down some snow day all day and watch the WHOLE thing, is my advice!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I loved this movie... if you liked any of the other Avenger movies, you'll like this one, too!  Would watch it again.
0425263916|5.0|I read 50 shades which I loved. I finished the whole series of 50 and needed something else to read. I was told how great this book was but I was very skeptic because I did not want it to be similar. LOVED THIS BOOK! CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I've seen reviews rating this the funniest movie ever, I can't say I liked it that much, but it WAS funny, and some spots had hilarious lines.  I'd watch it again, which says a lot... still think &#34;The Hangover&#34; is my choice for &#34;funniest of all time&#34; though.
B008A1B5Z0|3.0|This app is just okay.  Its a quick way to shut down apps that are running on your kindle.  You can do the same thing through your applications tab.
B001EBV0P8|5.0|This movie was made popular after it was released on DVD.  I heard about it from a friend a long time ago.  I have it on DVD and I wanted it on digital so I could take it with me whenever I needed it to watch on my Kindle.  It is that good.  I have referred a few people to buy it and they felt the same way.  What a great price I received it for as well.  The actors in this movie were great.  The movie is more than a prison movie.  It is really about hope and redemption.  If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a real treat.  I was lucky to have been on Amazon to get the special $3.99 price as a deal of the day.<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Amazon.  I love digital movies especially when I can get them at a great price.  Even if I already have the DVD version, having the digital copy is twice as nice.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Both disks were severely scratched upon receipt, but I've played both discs and not skips or problems. Would've rated 5 stars if discs were not scratched. Movie and extras are great!
B002KD0OSS|5.0|These audiophile pressings are dead silent and draw you convincingly into the scene of this performance - in all it's late night, 70's European glory.  Leonard Cohen speaks, the audience cheers, and you'll suffer through some of his poetry along the way.<br /><br />I would compare listing to Mr. Cohen in this era to listening to Bob Dylan - one of the most influential and artistic musical expressions you'll ever come across, yet delivered with unselfconscious candor.  He would have given the same performance at a camp fire or in a hotel room.  But, if you are looking at this set, you probably already knew that.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|it has action and it is a very good teaching for everyone and is a great lesson kids and adults
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Combining the fun of Angry Birds with the legendary Star Wars universe results in hours of entertainment.  Great idea to join these two world renouned phenomemons together!
B000JML90Y|5.0|I always wanted to read this and I came across it on the Kindle store.  it reinforced my views on Natural Selection.  Thanks Amazon.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|The movie is worth watching but it's not something you'll be talking about later.  The ending makes it worth the watch!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|lots of fun, but kind of frustratin to get it done.  Not as easy as it looks! Kids may find it a breeze
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great movie -  thought the actor was very good and  liked the way it continued reference to the orginal Jason Bourne
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|I watched this movie with my 11 year old son, (whom I would expect would hate a fairy movie) and we both loved it! This is my favorite of the first 3 Tinker Bell movies by far.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I am very disappointed in the HD camera for the Kindle Fire HD,  The design is awful, and it's a shame you have to buy an app to be able to use a built in on the Kindle Fire
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was the best thing I have ever read! Thanks for writing it!<br />It is so good I can't describe.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie. I know some may find it a sappy love story, but I love the sarcasm and humor of Austen entwined in the romance to be enchanting. Great for a rainy day. My guilty pleasure.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I agree with other reviewers who said that this was sort of a rehash of the first &#34;Pillars ...,&#34; which I absolutely loved. Follet seems to have followed a formula in writing this book, and many of the characters are practically interchangeable between the two. However, character development was better in the first book. In good writing, &#34;villains&#34; have positive characteristics and internal conflicts in addition to the negative qualities that ultimately rule their actions, and these make them human. In &#34;World ...,&#34; some primary characters serve as mere foils for the positive characters, and their decisions are so flatly and predictably evil as to make them cartoons of villains.<br /><br />In spite of this, the heroes and heroines are admirable and the scenarios interesting enough to make it a good read. I think I'd have enjoyed it more had I not just read &#34;Pillars ..,&#34; -- the better of the two -- and yet I did enjoy it and I'm glad I read it.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Funny movie, but a bit too much. Some of the references to things such as 911 were offensive. Definitely a movie for adults only.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary has quickly become my favorite show to watch. I highly recommend it as it is more intriguing than just your average crime drama.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Its not about Megadeth, but as it says, about Dave and his life which includes to a great extent Megadeth. its honest and direct, a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read it in one day! Very captivating story, could not put it down.  Can't wait to see the movies now!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Also an honest look inside the head of one of our most prominent trend setters in modern music. An interesing read, somewhat disturbing and not for kids!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put it down, same as the first book!  Very intriguing and wasn't expecting the ending at all!  Hope the 3rd book is as good!!
B004R1VXYU|5.0|It's unreal how great this album is! The songs are written very,very good. The guitar will blow you away. You will be sad the songs are done. You don't want the song to end. In a world of so much crappy music, this album is simply awesome. I seen these guys 12/29/12 in La Grange, Tx at a small venue. These guys brought the place down.i If you get a chance to see in person you will not be disappointed at all. Run, drive, buy online, whatever it takes get this  album! The song Different Mold is so awesome. It has to be one of the best tracks ever laid down! You  cannot turn this song loud enough. You will blow your speakers trying too. This song is 5:21 of pure mind blowing awesomeness. All the reviews don't do justice of how great this album is.  It's pure genius! Again do not hesitate one second, get this album! OK UPDATE. I have had this album for over a year now. It is just as good now as then. it stays in my cd player. You will not stop listening to it. Just that good.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is my age, so I can relate to his personal issues.  He is, of course, smarter than me (a requirement in protagonists).  The story moves along with minimal fluff and number of characters (i'm easily overwhelmed) and an intricate, but believable story.  The prose is straight-forward.  My first Harry Bosch novel, I will certainly buy more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You always know you will love his books. Excellent author. One of my favorites. I would recommend to anyone who loves his books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good story in the same genre as 1984. Collins gives Orwell a run for his money. Katniss makes a good heroine.
0060763280|5.0|The way Mr. Eker display the basics to this mindset is amazing. This book has completely renewed my thought pattern and assist me on a new way of looking at my financial life.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is addicting! It's a lot of fun and you really get into it. My son and I compete to see who can run farthest!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is completely addictive over the top fun! We raced through both seasons in record time and it left us wanting more!
B000P0J09W|5.0|Great movie. If you havent watched this movie you are missing out on an adventure & i recommend everyone watches the GOONIES
B009MO57H6|2.0|In a year that had great action movies (Safe, Expendables 2, The Raid Redemption, Dredd) I was really thinking that this year would continue that trend with RE: Retribution...<br /><br />Not so, as plot holes and stupidity abound in this flick, yes it's all at times entertaining, and looks good in 3D, but that still doesn't make up for it.<br /><br />Like where the hell did Chris, and Claire, go? They were there on the boat at the end of Afterlife, and yet they're magically gone at the beginning of this film with no explanation. Or the whole dumb VR simulation world, that just serves as a way to bring back some old characters (though I did like seeing the black team leader who got killed off in the first film).<br /><br />But I suppose I shouldn't be surprised as there really has yet to be a good entry in the series (Extinction comes closest to being good, for me).
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I finished this book a few days ago and can't stop thinking about it.  Yes, Adam Brown was a great SEAL.  But more than that, he was an amazing son, husband, dad and all around great person.  He died way too young but was such a blessing to all he came in contact with.  To me, his faith in Christ was the most powerful part of this book.  He overcame so much adversity because he always knew that God had a plan for him.  Rarely do I give five stars, but this book is deserving.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Loved the whole look of the game also so cute. My 4 yr old granddaughter can play it .on my kindel fire without help
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|very neat and graphics are so real. high definition and the chicks a milf. she should be in the game more.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|great movie! great music! heartwarming story . I really enjoyed this movie.joaqiuin phoenix should have won the oscar.<br />he was robbed
B003V5CTH8|5.0|This is one of the best elf gifts everrr! It's so cool! It comes with the elf DVD,  elf stickers, elf hat, the elf collectors tin etc. <3
B006AZZPCM|1.0|First, it started out great- I could download videos from Youtube an dthen convert them to MP3 songs- this was the stuff of dreams to me...then the dream transmogrified into a nightmare! It stopped downloading some videos, the videos I could download could not be converted; there were perpetually daily updates and newer versions...all these bug-a-boos could have been forgiven but for the fact that it kept literally billing me anytime I had any kind of funds in my Flex Bucket (I was with Cricket then), ensuring that my account was always depleted! And making me wrongly accuse the good people of Cricket of dishonorably emptying my account!<br />This is a nightmare app that I will dis-recommend to anyone based on my harrowing experience. I hope they have sorted out their problems since the last time I used it...as usual am Dave and I approve this message!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's adventurous, mysterious and really fun! I like and enjoy it a lot! You really do have fun when playing this game. It's enjoyable and it really does pass the time!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|After seeing the movie I am very happy to have the soundtrack. I I enjoy all of Howard shores work on these movies
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Perfect as advertised!  Good condition and great, probably best TV I've seen in a long time.  This is must see TV!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I heard J. Rowling interviewed on the radio regarding this book, and one of the things she said intrigued me.  She said she wanted to portray characters in poverty because she felt that her experience with being \\"on the dole\\" gave her some insight into that condition. The book provided little evidence of insight, into poverty or adolescence or any of the myriad themes she touches upon in the book.  Her characters are one-dimensional stick-figures,(an evil dealer, a clueless adolescent, a bully, a marriage-crazed divorcee, a bitter lesbian, a fat person, an ambitious person, a suffering daughter, a gossipy shopkeeper...need I go on?) and poverty is all about sex, drugs and rock-and-roll.<br /><br />It took me about half the book to develop any sense of the story. I had trouble keeping the characters straight, and had to go back to figure out who they were.  The narration was lackluster and bothersome - I kept asking myself, \\"Do I need to know this?  Why is she telling me this?\\" Ultimately Rowling ties up most of the threads, but did there need to be all those threads?  Why did she think she needed to touch on every societal issue out there? The book left me feeling that the editor was on vacation when it was submitted.  Coming in at around 500 pages, \\"A Casual Vacancy\\" is about 350 pages too long.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the second Navy Seal book that I have read this year and they are so moving. This book really gives you an idea of what these men go through to give there lives for us everyday and we should honor that. These man just made the country a better place, and I recommend that everybody reads this book.

B004R2DS9C|5.0|My son was thrilled with this gift.  He stores all of his Star Wars toys in it and opens it up often to use it as a play mat. The box is a great size to hold small and big toys.
B005LAIIA8|2.0|My husband and I saw this in a theatre on a Disney ship for free and thought it wasn't worth the price of admission. We both agreed it would've been summed up better in a half hour cartoon.  Approximately 1.5 hours of our lives that we'll never get back.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Such a cute idea.  You can zip down all the sides and use it as a mat or zip down one side and it looks like a runway at a fashon show.  The inside of the lid has a pool scene so Barbie can catch some rays before her fashion show.  My daughter is having so much fun with this box.  I LOVE that it holds A TON of Barbies and accessories.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child writes a good story with enough twists to keep your interest throughout the book.  As book one in the series it left me with a desire to read on.
B009LRE040|1.0|I expected much better from christian bale. The script was weak and felt like a retread of the batmans of past. looking for a better direction to take the movie. very lame ending. the job at task done weakly more goals and direction to the output of the movie.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Great story.I hope Jack finally ends up with one of the female characters maybe he will finally make it to Virginia

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Here he is...back to his old ways...keeping the reader in suspense and trying to figure things out on every page.<br /><br />I think I am fairly good at figuring out how and why and picking up the little clues left by the author so that later on the reader can sit, head in hand, and think, &#34;Oh, yes....when the protagonist did this...of course!  He did that because he planned to........&#34;.<br /><br />But not here....Grisham is WAY smarter than I am and I am thrilled that he is!<br /><br />Write another one just like this one...please!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works as expected and is a solid program. It will server you well and I  have not had any problem and use it quite a bit. You won't be disappointed if you take the time to use it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Having missed the first two seasons, I felt left out of conversations when friends were talking about the series. This was a great way to catch up and I look forward to season three (which I shall record on TV).
B00A757EFW|4.0|Very good clone of Pacman. Works as expected. It is easier that the original so you can play longer before you loose.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I thorouly enjoy The Big Bang Theory.  The cast is perfect. Sheldon is amazing and well in touch his charactor.  He delivers his lines with such humor and sarcasim.  Lenny's comments to Sheldon hits the nail on the head.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|This will keep you entertained for a while, but slowly looses it appeal. Not many variations, but if you want an easy entertaining racing game, it will keep your interest for a few days.

B009DT98RK|4.0|I thought is was a pretty awesome recording, but the original recording is definitely his best. This is pretty cool because he redid all the songs from his 1st live \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" double album and changed up alot of arrangment's and added somewhat different lead solo's to keep the music fresh.<br />I do give him credit for this, although sometimes I was waiting for that signature solo I was use to...with that being said; This is still a very nice recording and the band is tighter than ever(minus Bob Mayo,keyboard, guitar and John Siomos,drums).Their replacements are still very good. All being said; Frampton can still deliver the goods, even at 62yrs. If you you like Peter F. you will surly enjoy this 2 dvd set. Note# Second dvd is stuff recorded after the 1st amazing recording...still great music

B0063GORYU|1.0|Boring. No challenge, no special graphic, background is not exciting. Just something to pass the time when you have no books to read and don't have a connection.
1451695187|3.0|The book is a great for beginners seeking about near death and the after life.  Its exquisite in that regard.  A must read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I understand the concerns raised with the sex, rape, and overall firmness because there is definitely an abundance of these things in the book. But in return, you get an amazing story with deep and real characters, a huge lore backed world, and just overall a very well written story.
B002XZOZQA|4.0|This has always been a favorite movie.  Love the dancing and music is great.  Also like seeing how young everyone is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very kid friendly and it teaches you mathematics problem solving and money handling skills this is a great game
B000R8YC1I|5.0|It's a great movie for all ages. The craftsmanship and creativity of the storyline and visual art is simply unparallelled. We are spoiled these days with CGI. This movie shows us how things can be made to look unearthly and dreamlike even without computer graphics taking over the scene. I'm not anti-CGI or anything, but I am pro-hands-on craftsmanship, and this movie is saturated in that! Jim Henson and Brian Froud were a remarkable pairing! So meant to be!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I just can't stopped reading it! I really liked it. Want to buy the next one! Excellent book loved it!
B000001ABD|4.0|This Stevie Wonder collection is a must for your collection. Stevie is the best song writer of his generation. If you enjoy his songs, this is a must. A good traveling CD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I first read this book in my freshman year of high school, eight years ago. Since then I've read it at least five times. It is definitely a favorite.
B009HSPODE|5.0|A fantastic collection of short stories!  Munro is the best living short story writer. Her storeis are masterpieces equal or better than short stories of Chekhov or Hemingway.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw this movie before reading it and the movie doesn't do justice to the true story of the Hunger Games. I loved it.
B002ZG99CM|1.0|Sad to say that Will Smith's son should look for another career, he sucks as as actor.  Jaden Smith should go back to acting school, after seeing this and the overacting in the day the earth stood still I think if it were not for has famous parents he would be nameless or unknown.  I guess its great to have rich and famous parents.  Save your money, see, rent or buy the original a much better movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ahhhh amazing book!!!!!!!!! This book met the expectations I had when j started reading it it was very very good
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I have watched this befor but I was so addicted I had to buy it because I missed heaps the first time I saw it this is awesome scifi plus adventure with lots of contravercial real life issues. Must see SCIFI
B00APUYWYA|2.0|If you are into Glee you probably would like this movie.  My wife wanted to watch it so we rented it when our grown daughter came to visit.  Getting to the end was painful even for them.
B004X60QE2|5.0|This is halriously captivating and intuitve scifi classic a must see if you love science this is the show for you.
B009E3EY38|5.0|An absolute high water mark of their careers & a fitting triumphant return to live performance from the greatest band in the world. With this show, they fortified their reputation for excellent live performances & I love this boxed set, well worth the money. It looks good, it sounds good, it IS good.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|It is a good book. It is sad&happy sunny is a small comedian in the book. I think about what they have gone through.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE DragonVale!!! It has great music and fun and cute dragons!!! And it is even possible to breed every dragon! I found my own secret combination for breeding the legendary dragons, like the blue moon dragon!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great game for kids and family<br />*only if cut the rope was free that would make my year
B000M341QE|4.0|This is a fast-moving, complex story where you really have to pay attention to follow what's going on.  The attempt at accents, and the real accents, and Jack Nicholson's mumbling can make the dialog a bit hard to understand, but the dialog is essential to following the story.  Turning on subtitles, or turning up the center speaker, may help.<br /><br />It's a Hong Kong cop movie rehosted to the Massachusetts State Police, but set in Boston.  It's cruel and violent at times, not for the squeamish.  After Gilbert Grape, I think it is one of DiCapprio's better performances.  Even Jack Nicholson manages to play a character not entirely resembling Jack Nicholson sometimes.  Matt Damon, too.  And some other big names in smaller roles.<br /><br />The back cover gives away enough of the plot to give you the basic idea up to about 3/4 of the way through.  If you don't read it, you might still figure out the trajectory of the plot.  But there are nooks and crannies, twists and turns, along the way to keep it interesting.<br /><br />As a metro Boston resident, I enjoyed some very familiar locations, notably Boston's Chinatown, even if the scenes seem to suggest that a certain alley exists near the dogs at the entrance.  There's no alley like that there; there's one like it around the corner a block away.  But this obviously does not detract from the story, and is not out of the ordinary for a location movie.<br /><br />When I say \\"Good to a point\\", I mean that I thought it was interesting until it was time to wrap up the story.  That happens swiftly, and isn't all that interesting.  I was a bit let down by the ending.<br /><br />I might give it three and a half stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that.  It's closer to four, so that's what it gets from me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had no idea what was going to happen next. I absolutely loved how passionate and deep the characters were. <3
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|Overlook the lame plot, and it's a lot of fun to watch. The cycling shots and stunts are great. You won't fall asleep during this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is an amazing ending to the Fifty Shades Trilogy! I loved it and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read.
0143116053|4.0|what I liked was that the man growing deaf had another more frustrating problem, and that was caring for a 90 plus year old father who was suffering from dementia!  told in a gripping but non sentimental manner, the story could fit any one of many readers who will identify with it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I got this for Christmas, and I couldn't put it down.  All the twists and turns, and sudden disclosures, Wow!  Breathtaking.  No spoilers here.  Sorry.  Tom Clancy keeps doing it superbly.  I hope he keeps going for decades to come, and trains someone to continue after that!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Warning - this show is highly addictive. I watched Seasons 1 & 2 in just 3 days. My 12 y/o son got hooked at the end of Season 1 and watched the rest of the episodes with me until we had watched them all. We can't wait for season 3!!!! A must watch!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|This is a quick read that seems like it could be out of today's headlines.  And with a nice, if expected, twist at the end it's an antidote to some of the more gruesome love stories that seem to populate our bookshelves today like &#34;Gone Girl&#34; --- another great read, but a much different take on love/marriage.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Well, after anticipating this novel for over a year, I can honestly say it was worth the wait! Preston & Child are the best authors around and I, for one, think they should write faster. LOL. The book was interesting from the first page and I couldn't put it down for very long. Of course, after I finished it, came a sense of missing it! The plot is action, non-stop and the characters are at their very best. Keep up the good work!
B004Q9T4E4|5.0|I would rate this book as important as &#34; On China&#34; by Kissinger. Dan' t miss it, read it you will like it and it will help you understand much of what is happening in todays's economic world.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show and amazing quality video from Amazon- it streams with no difficulty on my 42 inch 1080 tv- though sometimes I wish the picture wasn't so accurate! Season 3 hands-down is the best yet and is VASTLY superior to season 2!
B009MCRHH6|2.0|An okay game, but it gets very tedious after a short time.  I have played several times, and finally just decided it wasn’t worth the time.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Such a cute love story. Totally predictable but a good read nonetheless. I couldn't put it down. Perfect quick read! :]
B0076DCT2G|2.0|The main character has gone too far. I think this is my last Nelson DeMille. I'm sad to have read John Corey  slide into ..........
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was not one of Grisham's best.  There was not much action in it and it started really slow.  I quickly assumed much of the plot.
0449012751|5.0|I loved the book so much that I purchased the audio. Jim Broadbent reads such life into the words giving Harold Frye a companion on his journey......the listener.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|This model looks very life-like. The coloring and the features are great. My grandsons are really into dinos and he is very popular with them.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a good, clean show to watch. After a few episodes you are absolutely hooked. Much better quality than most the stuff on tv today. I bought this because I know so many people who watch this show and the seasons are so far apart we need a refresher before season 3 starts. Can't wait! I highly recommend this series!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|Slice Ice is hard to play and difficult to keep things in proper perspective on the small screen of the Evo phone
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I certainly laughed; but since so many people raved that this was the funniest movie ever my expectations were high.  Yes it was laugh out loud funny, but like Hangover 2 it just seemed over the top.  I'd say worth seeing, just be prepared for complete inappropriate stuff and take it for what it is.
B00846REIS|1.0|I had high hopes for this after falling in love with the Fifty Shades trilogy. \\"Oh it's so much better!!! More developed characters and storyline.\\"  But I found a lot of it more disturbing than Christian Grey's Red Room of Pain. Not at all what I was expecting. I don't want to judge too quickly, but when I finished 'Fifty Shades of Grey', I honestly couldn't go to sleep without finding out what would happen in 'Darker'. I downloaded it right away and stayed up even later to dive into the second book. After this first book, I think I'm more creeped out than anything and have no real desire to read the next. So...overall disappointed and tempted to read my 'Fifty' books again.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was a great addition to the Pendergast series.  It had a lot of suspense and I really enjoyed it.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|I read The Scorch Trials right after finishing Maze Runner because I couldn't wait to read the continuation of the story, and although it was good, by the time I got to the end I had enough of the story and am not really interested in reading the third book. This book fell a little flat after Maze Runner, but it was still good and I recommend it if you loved Maze Runner.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I've been a Tom Clancy fan since The Hunt for Red October and have read every book (in order) that he's written (fiction only).  This latest novel, Threat Vector is a continuation of the Ryan legacy and focuses on the Campus - won't bore you with details - if you're reading these reviews, chances are you're already familiar with the background.  Nevertheless, the storyline is pretty good and despite being over 800 pages, reads quickly.  It's very difficult to put down despite the late hour.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not quite sure what to make of the last couple of books that Tom Clancy has written with Mark Greaney.  Who actually writes the book?  Is it a collaboration? Does Greaney write the book and Clancy provide the story?  Does Clancy merely slap his name on the book to sell more covers?  Is this a James Pattersonesque deal?  Regardless, the story is well written and flows very well.  However, the suspense of some of his earlier novels seems to be missing.  There's another thing.  Clancy was a man known for attention to detail and that seems to be missing a bit in this latest novel.  As another reviewer pointed out, some mistakes in detail popped up - such as the statement that Jack, Jr was the eldest child of Jack and Cathy Ryan (no....Sally is).  Clancy would never have made that error.  This is why I'm wondering who actually wrote the book...
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom has done it again.  When I was done, I was looking for more book to read.  What's next?
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Have each season on DVD........ one of the best  &#34;nightime soaps&#34;  geared for the men ( and ladies like it too) out there.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I loved watching the pitch perfect movie and it is amazing that i can listen to the songs when ever i want.  Some of the songs are inappropriate so over 12 would be a good age limit.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is an awesome game. I totally think you should get it. its awesome. You can get ap many different type of dragons!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is fantastic, one of the better strategy games I've played. The sound track is phenomenal, the sirens alone are so realistic that they made my dog bark!<br />Well worth the price. If you have an android you owe it to your device to get this app.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Dogs view of his life with his family and their trailers and tribulations.  Sneaks In a fair bit of racing as well.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying the album so far, nothing to report negative in any way. This is my first foray into Of Monsters and Men's catalog, and I'm impressed so far.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|My anticipation for watching this movie exceeded my eventual satisfaction with it.  Great special effects, fine action sequences, good acting (considering the script diaglogue).  But what were the script writers thinking?  First, the gimmicky plot change to eliminate Mars was senseless--as was the high speed &#34;train&#34; tunnel through the earth's core.  The role of the main female antagonist was typically uni-dimensional and ultimately boring.  The amazing fighting skills of the leader of the &#34;bad guys&#34; was a pretty flimsy plot device and served no purpose but to provide yet another fight scene.  I kept waiting for the shared hand scars gimmick to be woven into the plot--and wasn't disappointed (but not especially thrilled).  Also, many things were left unresolved (e.g., was our hero really a bad guy before his memory was wiped?  If so, why did they bother to wipe his memory?  Why did I bother to even care?).  And the plot holes? Tally those up to a major stretching of the &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34;.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful resource! Love the audio feature!  Great for persons who have problems with reading. Red letter edition that highlights the words of Jesus.
0061906220|5.0|We read it over and over - what fun we had! We gave this copy to my grandson's kindergarden teacher for the class to enjoy! Will buy other Pete books for sure!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read it in two days! A GREAT READ!<br />Looking forward to the movie. Really enjoy the characters in this one.
0345803485|5.0|So very good...50 Shade of Grey will go down in history as the greatest series of books for 2012. Wow!!!
B004V5A7K8|1.0|I loved the old blocks game but the controls on the screen just do not work as good as the video game console.  too hard to keep up with the ball
0425263908|5.0|Enjoyed it very much. can't wait until the third book comes out. Hope it has a happy ending..Sylvia Day is becoming my favorite Author.
B00000K19E|4.0|Enter the Matrix where the real is unreal. This film tries to provide an explanation to those who feel the observable day to day does quiet seem real. This film almost feels like a movie about how it feels like one is watching a movie every moment of their lives. There are a few who know the truth and want to help wake up those who don't realize it. Hence, the ultimate wake up call comes in the form of Neo, a disenchanted computer hacker who seeks to find out what is reality and how to enter it. The tension of the film comes when one of the inner circle decides to betray the others. Turns out reality isn't as beautiful or delicious as the matrix. The villain wants back into the system. Call it bureaucracy is better than starving. Keep in mind these guys are eating gruel, wearing what looks like prison garb and constantly on the run when they are finally awaken. It might get to some people. The Matrix is the search for the Messiah of the times. The times simply happens to be in a the future where robots harvest humans for energy.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Absolutely not expecting the crude vulgarity and content, totally misrepresented and beyond poor choice. Should have warning label and not be made to look like typical animated movie.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|The game has a similar structure to cut the rope! also its challenging at times which is fun, like cut the rope! Anyone who loves a good puzzle game would moat likely love this app!(:
B009T9P7OC|1.0|i don't care if this works just fine and it plays songs, it even has a \\"bookmark\\" function aka start over from where you left off even if you go to another song something i haven't had in an actual mp3 player in years.  all of that doesn't matter because i was FOOLED INTO BUYING THE ******* paid version thinking that the \\"some features\\" not available included the speed control.  rather the speed control is very very hidden.  the program has a changing menu \\"pressing the menu box on the kindle menu screen\\" depending upon where you are in the software.  now you'd think that when you are playing the mp3 in the control part is where you would want to change the speed of the song you are listening to right?  no you have to back out into the list part of the song player THEN press the menu button and go to the sound options and at the bottom is the speed control.  very cleverly hidden so people think it's a paid only feature.  IT'S NOT i went back to the free part and low and behold it's still there (and yes it still lets you change it doesn't say this is a paid option please buy the paid version).  the only thing i can possibly think is that they did it that way to con people into paying for it.  i spent 20 minutes getting ticked and stressed looking for that feature in the PAID VERSION.<br /><br />i don't know why i'm writing this review because i'm sure they will get amazon to take this down so they can keep on committing fraud.  hopefully one person can see this DO NOT PAY FOR THIS VERSION GET THE FREE ONE.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just like Baldaci, Ken Follett is a truly excellent writer. Anytime I am looking for a good read, I look for anything new by these guys.
0316789798|5.0|Ed Emberley helps children draw by creating a series of simple steps.  My daughter's love of drawing began with his books when she was 6.  Anyone can draw when they use Ed Emberley's books as a guide.  Simple and easy to use!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is really funny and kept me entertained the whole movie.Even my husband liked it. Just the right amount of cheesy!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I already had this app on my cell phone. Once I bought my kindle fire, I decided to download it to e-reader as well. The reading plans on there are very versatile too. I think there is a plan to fit any lifestyle. I am attempting to read the entire bible in 90 days. I am really pumped. The option to download a copy of the NIV for offline reading was a plus because this the version of the bible I usually read too.
B0085YNML2|5.0|The game is a real challenge, its not like you can just zoom through all the levels and be done. You have to stop and think about the order of the flowers. I like that. Not all the levels require hard thought and thats a good balance.
B0052GACNM|5.0|After purchasing 2 previous Tony Bennett CDs and then seeing him live in concert last year, we knew we wanted this album.  We were not disappointed.  It is great.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Awesome Game!<br />I was worried it was one of those lame &#34;hidden object game&#34;. Well, it sort of is. But it really keeps you interested and you get to drive the plot of the game rather than it taking you from room to room.<br /><br />Helpful tip, touching everywhere isn't a bad idea.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this all the time, I love it! It's pretty addicting, actually. I find myself checking it several times a day. It comes in very handy!
B008458O3S|5.0|Easy to use, and super fun. The tutorials are built right in without being overly annoying! Reminds me of &#34;Candy Train&#34; from Popcap Games!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie similar to Matrix and 13th floor.  If you like those, you'll enjoy this one as well... in addition to Bruce in action.  Plenty of action and great story.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|We live in a new golden age of fantasy authors.  With people such as Brandon Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie, and many others, our choice of great fantasy is at an all time high.<br /><br />However, with all these authors, Patrick Rothfuss has created something special in his Kingkiller Chronicles.  The Wise Man's fear is the second entry in the best fantasy series published in this century.  His simple tale of Kvothe is so engaging compared to so many of the epic &#34;save-the-world&#34; stories.  It's incredible how he mixes societies and cultures, and creates a unique blend of world that is fantastic yet familiar.<br /><br />This book does contain a few &#34;intimate romantic interludes&#34; and descriptions of violence (not overtly grotesque), so this book may not be suitable for a younger audience.  My opinion is that the book rates a PG-13.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's book was absolutely fascinating.  I could not put the book down.  I purchased 4 books and gave 3 to friends as gifts.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It kept me engaged and involved with the story right up to the end - which was quite a surprise.  I would never have guessed how the twists and turns would resolve.  I also enjoyed the way the story was told in flashback. Once you got used to this way of writing then the story flowed really well.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really thought this book was interesting. I have never read a book quite like it before. The story line was different than other books I have in this genre. I highly recommend the book.
0547884591|5.0|Great book. I haven't completed it yet, but the information offered in here is a must. It's much heavier on the pictures than his previous books, but I'm not complaining, just pointing it out. Seriously, buy this one.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I started out fine with this game, thought it was great. Then, all if a sudden, I wasn't able to buy/make/build anything.  All of the options were greyed out, and they said &quot;unlock at population 0&quot;.  Does that mean I have to kill everyone off somehow? So I contacted Gameloft's &quot;Customer Care&quot; department via online  submission through the game's main menu. NO RESPONSE!  Not even a courtesy &quot;hey, sorry 'bout that. we'll look into it and get back to you&quot;  NOTHING.  But since I liked the game, I decided to take matters into my own hands.  I removed the game from my phone, and re-started my journey on my kindle fire. But now I can't access my Gameloft friends, so I have no neighbors.  Grrrrr!  I think I'm done with Gameloft games.  They obviously don't care that their customers are FRUSTRATED, and lucky for us customers, there are a LOT of other game developers to choose from.  Sorry if we were neighbors, but my Oregon township is now a ghost town.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|Our house is seen in the opening scene of this movie . They were filming may 2009 and it was neat to see the final project . They filmed all around sunland - Tujunga, ca . Puts us on the map
B0013ND30M|5.0|Came in orginal package with plastic, just as if I bought it l bought it from the store. It was in perfect condition!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I am a big Michael Connelly fan, especially with Harry Bosch. This book has the feel that Harry has seen better days
B0044XV3R8|5.0|great that i have options to watch as shown at theater or with deleted scenes added  and also nice to have the option to remove the &#34;colorful&#34; language if needed
B000I9X53W|4.0|It had been years since I first saw this movie. Great comedic supportive cast, writing and direction. Dustin is great as &#34;Tootsie&#34;!
B009GEEMLY|3.0|We rented this through Amazon streaming and eagerly plunked down in the couch to watch the early summer blockbuster.  We were disappointed in the feature and it seemed really corny.  Whereas we loved the Iron Man movies to date, this one just felt like a &#34;we've got to do this... we've got to cash in... NOW&#34; movie.<br /><br />Iron Man is always great.  This movie's Hulk is fantastic.  I want to see a another flick designed around this version Hulk character.<br /><br />I like popcorn movies to forget about the job, the mortgage, the bills... and this had potential, but we found ourselves just finishing the movie because we felt we needed to.  We had just spent the money to rent it.
B005S39YGU|5.0|I've been wondering why everyone is always raving about a show about a bunch of Nerds. After watching one episode I was hooked. I'm catching up on all seasons by watching 5 to 6 episodes at each sitting. I rarely laugh out loud but do so constantly with these folks.
B008MM9630|5.0|I was looking for a gardening game and when I seen this game I downloaded it right away! I love fairies and gardening so it's perfect for me!!
B003EY9UZU|4.0|Saw it in the movies hen it came out and didn't care for it much. Watched it at home and really liked it a lot more.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This CD was a Christmas gift for my son and he loved it. He mentioned that he liked the band so I blindly choose this one, it ended up being his favorite gift.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Si la primera temporada fue excepcional, esta no lo es menos.<br />Sonido buen&iacute;simo.<br />Calidad audiovisual excelente.<br />Recomendada totalmente.<br />Como siempre, gracias Amazon.<br /><br />A m&aacute;s ver, H.
B00000IO4J|4.0|Great quality vhs,movie seemed to make a faint high pitched buzzing sound when i played it but barely enough to override the sound.
B005KR6NJU|5.0|Buenos d&iacute;as y buena suerte.<br />Una calidad audiovisual impresionante y un sonido exquisito para esta maravillosa serie de animaci&oacute;n para adultos.<br />Maravillosa.<br /><br />A m&aacute;s ver, H.
B006VREHRS|5.0|There's a lot of twists and turns. Always keeps you guessing what going to happen next. One of the best shows of the year.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome, I love this trilogy and can't wait for the movies! Just a few more months before Catching Fire comes out in theaters!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I have enjoyed Mr Taleb's view of how things worked since I was introduced to it in The Black Swan.  He hits another home run in this book!
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Versitile, looks good, functional, I love it.  Recommend it.  Buy one, Only nine more words left to go before I can submit this review
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Great as Edward. Awful in this!! I turned it off after 10 min. Too painful to watch. Don't waste your time or money.
B005JABU82|5.0|because it was best one yet.<br />too much sticker and took to long.<br />i would recommend this one to all my friend
B003O86FMW|5.0|Took just a day but was a good read. Can't wait to read the rest of the story. Also can't wait for the movie.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Jo Nesbo must have enjoyed his visit to Sydney, Australia as he has filled his novel with good local references including cultural references. As a Sydneysider, I appreciated that he liked my city, and I guess others might find the Sydney scene exotic and interesting just as I enjoy reading novels set in LA or NY. Harry Hole (pronounced Hooley) is also a new detective with interesting character flaws and I look forward to following his furthere adventures.  And as detective novels since Agatha Christie have done, you are presented with a tortuous plot and many red herrings.  A good read.  And if you think you want to follow the  Harry Hole series, read this one first as later books contain plot spoilers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. Glad I read it before seeing the movie. And the movie was true to the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|To me, Grisham has done it again. This was a very quick read; I finished it in two days. Partly because it had captured my imagination with its multiple twists and turns but also because it is easily digestible.
B000O5AYC0|5.0|I don't know much about this, but got it for my brothers birthday and he loved it, so it must be a quality album.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very heartwarming for anyone who is an animal lover.  Many times it reminded me of something my dog appears to think or wishes she could say!
B00480OHWK|1.0|I bought to read for gkids. The pictures were not on pages with words. I was actually unable to make the book legible. Very disappointed.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Summation: Personal paths and the path to achieving them are not sought by all, you must follow your heart. Loved this book.
B005LAJ212|5.0|REVENGE IS GREAT!!<br />My husband and I loved Revenge. We can hardly wait to see the next season. We know it is playing on t.v. now, but we like the DVD so we doon't have to wait a whole week to see the next episode. It's great entertainment!!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is a really fun, original game, but potential buyers should be warned it requires more strategy than most droid games.  In fact, it requires a fair deal, and you can expect to lose your first few games until you figure out what you're doing.  For some people, like me, this is a good thing, but not everyone will agree with that.
B00506NRBS|3.0|Quick Read, I Enjoyed His Insights, But After Reading Through His Website I Had Hoped That This Book  Had A Little More SubstanceH
B006OCM0G0|1.0|The app doesn't work properly, and therefore the game is not very fun. It's quite boring, according to my daughter.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not what I usually read but was recommended several times.  Excellent read.  In fact kept me si interested I read all three books in just over a week!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I have not missed an episode so there are no complaints here.  Like the title says - love, love love it!!
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|I played this game through to the end and the game play itself was good, but the movement controls on the maps and the story line were a bit lacking.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good movie but not a blockbuster - entertaining and I did love the actors. Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams worked well together and Clint Eastwood will always be a legend.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this is a great version of Mahjong with a longer play time in order to beat the game.  The con that I have is that it tends to wear down the battery on my phone when I play it for more than a round or two.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Like most of the folks here, I am a huge Corey fan, and like DeMille's wise guy character. I did find this book drug on, with little happening till the end. Still, an average Corey is a cause to celebrate. My wife listened to the book read by the wonderful Scott Brick and enjoyed it. It might work best as an audio book.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|this is a candy version of Bejeweled.  Though I enjoyed playing this game, it tended to eat up battery life and I just plain got bored of it after a month or two of intermittent playing.  Great if you need something to entertain a younger audience while they are bored, but not a great game to have overall.
B004UFEJXK|4.0|This is an interesting movie that I have grown to like.  My 3 year old LOVES it. Be sure and watch the Pixar shorts that are in the bonus features of the disc blu ray they are really funny.<br /><br />This is a good combo pack too.
0345803493|5.0|I enjoyed reading the second book of the Fifty Shades series.  There is a little less smut in this book and the story line really takes off.  If you have read the first book in the series this is a definite must read.
B0034G4P8A|1.0|I received the disc and there was only a blue-ray disc. The DVD had been opened and resealed, so this is not what I payed for at all. There should have been two disc and a digital copy. It is my own fault that I did not return this but during the holiday I do not have time to deal with thses unfortunate issues and this is the risk I take shopping online. So buyers be aware of buying DVD's online.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|It just gets a little old after awhile.  My nephew likes the game though so it might just be the age group. Overall the game is pretty seamless and has a nice play time for each level.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Played this game intermittently over a month or two and decided it was not worth the time.  There were not many puzzles boards to go through and there were never any new boards released.  It got boring after a while.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|It wasn't quite what I expected.  I thought this was going to be better than the character on the Smallville program, it wasn't.  I think the Smallville Character had a better background story.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is 100% addicting when it comes to getting a perfect score.  The puzzles for each level are not always as easy as they seem and I enjoyed going back through each level and try to get a perfect score on each one.  Can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Been playing for hours and I'm still not bored of it. Awesome game. It seems pretty easy, and some of the levels are, but it can get a little stumping, so I highly recommend it for all ages.
0345803507|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Fifty Shades series.  This book (like the second book) has less erotic scenes and more story line.  Overall I enjoyed the book until about 5 chapters from the end.  At that point I didn't enjoy the ending as much as I thought I would.  It wasn't as climactic as I would have liked.  Overall great series.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This was an very interesting read. Certainly most of are curious about who Steve Jobs was and how he created the juggernaut that is Apple. However, for me learning what he was like was disappointing. It seems too many people today believe success requires a disregard for others, a difficult personality, and self centeredness. While brilliant and creative, Steve suffered from these personality flaws. I hope people take away that being unconventional, driven, and creative are what led Steve to his success, not his mistreatment of many. Read this if you are interested in business or apple products and enjoy reading about people who have accomplished great things.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I purchased these as a gift for my husband and he loves the fact that the blu-rays are all in the same box set but have their own mini-cases (very thin).  Great box set for these movies!
