B00G3HSF7O|3.0|Regardless of your political profile, this is a pretty one-dimensional movie. The one-percenters finally get almost all of everything, despise the 99 percenters as useless vermin and live in the ultimate walled community...in space.  Those in space seem to be all white anglo types, while the rest of the those on Earth seem to be Hispanic with some anglos that get along with them.<br /><br />I really think sci-fi can do better.  Dazzling effects do not help a lame script.  Early on, the hero is poisoned with radiation and the CEO of the place where he works asks if his skin will soon start to peel off.  He is only concerned that the sheets under him would have to be replaced. Just not great writing, sorry. Skip this and watch District 9 first.<br /><br />Well, at least it is obvious race and class baiting.  Some day look at the final few minutes of the 1950's &#34;When Worlds Collide&#34; to see the new Ark, a spaceship holding 40 people about to launch. 40 people....all white.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Matt Damon when rigged with an exoskeleton looks like he is hooked up to a bunch of plastic PVC pipe and silver duct tape with an iPod on the back of his head.
B00005S6K8|4.0|The DVD did not include all that was on the VHS.  There was an extra song performed at the end of the VHS.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I like this game very well it works your mind. I think it is healthy to keep your mind sharp.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is amazing! I'm a techie and it's one of the better items I have purchased.  Buy it now before Google realizes it could sell it for 3 times as much.  The best part is that it's not a &#34;mirroring&#34; tool.  It actually casts the video so you are free to use your phone/tablet for other things.  You can even turn your device off!  Great for battery saving too.  USB cord can hook into your TV for constant power.  Only a few apps (Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and HBO Go), but you can be sure many more will be coming in the near future.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best alarm clock app out there. It is really loud and easy to program. I also like the general design of the app. not too bright and very simple to navigate!
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|This is a good product and pricepoint if you're looking for a wireless gamepad.  Most phones/tablets have bluetooth connectivity built in.  All you have to do it turn on the gamepad (hold down the home button) and then pair it with your device.<br /><br />Not 5 stars because it the analog joystick has poor movement and the connector for charging has no cord, so it can really only be used in a computer and not on the wall.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product at a amazing price.! the streaming options are a bit limited at the moment but with the addition to HBO and pandora its a good sign that streaming companies are  embracing the chromecast.
B00004X10B|5.0|Great bag for a great price. It holds a lot of equipment that you need. I love this bag and glad I purchased it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I bought it for friends who hadn't heard the musical commentary. They were at first unconvinced but ultimately really enjoyed it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter will play this game constantly. She loves that they incorporated mlp and equestria girls together. She was playing it constantly on the kindle and I downloaded it to see what she was playing. Make sure you have the parental controls set so they cant do in game purchases or you will have a very large bill, but it is just like any other game nowadays. If you want to have a better in game experience you can purchase more ponies and homes.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Good story of a subject often forgotten. Steven Speilberg did a great job with this story. I was thoroughly enthralled.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this game.  It is a relaxing game of solitaire at its best.  So glad I made this purchase.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Absolutely excellent movie! About a father who finds himself having to make a horrific life event into a game for the sake of his young son (he didn't want him to be aware of how bad things were). The ending will disappoint you (You've been warned).<br />I don't usually like to read my movies (but God dubbings suck), but this is the rare exception.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|Well done game, brings me back to the old myst and riven day, but to short! Its worth playing though!
B000SGRONM|5.0|Hilarious! I would read it out loud to my (adult) sister just because the words had to be put out into the world. David Sedaris is a FOOL!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Is too bad that you can't leave the game for more than a couple of days and not have to start at level o e again.  Very disappointing.
B000N2HCM4|3.0|I had to read this for a class - Race, Politics, and the Law (UCLA). It was very interesting to find out about Mr. Obama's upbringing, it did a great job of humanizing a figure who is so highly lauded (#POTUS), and, surprisingly, he was very funny. However, it felt forced at times and, as he states in his forward, he is aware of its shortcomings.
B00F3NX4C0|5.0|I've been waiting YEARS for this to get a proper re-issue on wax and let me tell you, Music on Vinyl has outdone themselves once again. The jacket comes printed on a nice high gloss hard stock. I managed to get one of the 1st pressings on clear green wax which was a nice surprise. Sound quality is top notch and the record itself is pressed on heavy weight wax.<br /><br />Anyone looking for this album should rest assured that this is worth it's asking price and then some....

0395389496|5.0|Cute and perfect story for the Christmas holiday.  This is a hardcover book and perfect for kids of all ages and adults too.  I gave it as a gift to someone who was away for Christmas.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|Cornwell must have run out of creativity. I've always loved her books but this one dwells on gore and misery. On TV, she implied the Sandy Hook tradgedy was part of the book but really in this case only to highlight the gore there. This book lacked story.
B00DNV9V1W|3.0|Way more difficult than a Zagg to instal. It sticks to your phone by static cling, so imagine all the dust it collects. The directions say to start to peel off the packaging coating, then lay it on the phone and finish peeling. All the dust the packaging layer collected got in between my screen and the protector. I ended up having to remove the packaging away from my phone so it did not drop dust on the screen. This is a disaster if you have to try to reposition it. I used all three trying to get one on without a ton of dust between it and my screen. I gave up and left some bubbles. I much prefer screen protectors that do not adhere to the phone by way of static cling. If you can figure it out it's much cheaper than the zagg and feels like decent material.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is so much fun I just started playing an I'm already hooked an I cant wait 2 c Wat's next

B00G5G7FL0|4.0|I wasn’t quite sure if I wanted to see Frozen from Walt Disney Animation Studios. I liked last year’s Wreck-it Ralph so I thought that this could be good too. On the other hand, I already paid for a lot of movie tickets this year and I spent A LOT on special tickets for the second Hobbit next month (I’ll explain later). I did see some good reviews, though, so I literally decided earlier today and get up and trek to a theater by myself to see Frozen.<br /><br />This movie deliberately recalls the fairy-tale movies that the studio is most known for. The really nice thing about the plot is that it plays around with the stereotypical Disney-movie tropes—to state exactly how would be the spoil the plot. It also has some rather intense moments.<br /><br />The characters are nice too. Even the dorky-looking snowman isn’t terribly annoying (though I still wish that he’d actually blow his own head off as he did in an early trailer). The graphics and animation are most impressive. Considering how this picture centers on snow and ice, it was critical that those look good, and indeed they do. The songs were a bit of a distraction—any kind of musical seems to inherently have that problem unless it’s a veritable opera like Phantom of the Opera—but they’re not bad at all and they do their job in developing characters and plot.
1582701709|5.0|Excellent reading once you get your mind geared for it. I didn't think it would be like it was, so I wasn't mentally ready for it. In due time after the Christmas holidays, I will get back into the book.

B000001FMC|5.0|Swing out Sister is among the best of '80s pop music groups, but their blend of pop and jazz is as fresh today as it was in 1987. This is the perfect cd to pop into your car's player and enjoy while cruising a scenic road. Corrine Drewery's vocals are showcased by lush and rhythmic arrangements of classic orchestral  instrumentation along with modern electropop. The four bonus remix tracks are the icing on the cake.

B00FHATBGW|5.0|I have played a fair few of these mystery type games and I have to say this has been the best I've played! GREAT graphics! NO glitches. The search and find were clever but didn't overpower the puzzles/games within the game - nice variety.  I use hints only when necessary and they were designed well. This game stimulated reasoning skills, creativity and resourcefulness. I didn't get bored at any time and challenging parts were compelling...made me use my noggin.  VERY happy with all aspects. Will be looking for more from this game maker in the future! Can't wait till the sequel!

It was different from time to kill yet it brought all the same satisfaction as the tiles began to fall in place.  Jake is quite a guy.  I enjoy the fact that he honors his family.  I would enjoy another visit  with this family

B00407PNY2|5.0|Peter Yates had a blockbuster on his hands when he was given this project. Steve McQueen is Frank Bullitt, a hard=nosed San Francisco detective given (reluctantly) an assignment by an overambitious, opportunistic politician, Walter Chalmers, (Robert Vaughn, The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) who cares only about getting his name and face in the papers. Bullitt also has to deal with, as if he didn't have enough problems, two overbearing superiors (Norman Fell, Three's Company, The Ropers and Simon Oakland, Baa Baa Black Sheep, The Night Stalker) to also make sure the witness he and his crew are asked to guard makes it to the courtroom=alive! Unfortunately, both the witness and one of Bullitt's men are slugged by two hit men from Chicago. The witness dies and the cop is in the hospital with a leg shot. Infuriated, Bullitt accuses Chalmers (Vaughn) of arranging the hit. Chalmers tries the blame game till Bullitt puts him in his place. Bullitt turns over every stone in San Francisco to get the assassins before they try again. It leads to a cabdriver who allegedly took the witness through some of the city. Bullitt takes the same route, unknown he has unwanted company. This is when the car battle begins (Both McQueen and driver Bill Hickman rehearsed the route prior to filming. It is also Hickman who plays one of the assassins). The foes tear apart San Francisco in a no holds barred fight with the pedal through the floorboards of both cars, McQueen's 1967 390 Mustang versus the assassins 440 magnum Dodge Charger (Both vehicles don't make it). After the crash, heads start to roll and Chalmers presses his luck again=until the truth comes out-the witness was the wrong man! Who is the idiot now? This film took McQueen to major superstar status and don't forget the music score by Argentinian legend Lalo Schifrin (The Cincinnati Kid). An immortal classic for Ford and Chrysler fans as well as crime drama fanatics! Hickman would also test his driving skills with Richard Lynch versus Roy Scheider in The Seven Ups, another great crime drama.heider in The Seven Ups, another great crime drama.
B008133MDK|5.0|The show is interesting, clever and fun, and the chemistry between the actors is fab! I'm looking forward to a Season 3.
B0045ODPKY|5.0|One of the better films this this leading lady has done in my opinion.  A fun, fast moving story with lots of action.  Most of the stunts were off the chart.  The movie was beautifully shot.  I am a fan of the cinematographer (Director of Photography), so I try to see all of the movies he shoots.

0316069515|4.0|After pulling one of his patented courtroom &#34;stunts&#34; to get one of his &#34;guilty&#34; clients off, Mickey is handed a murder case involving an internet &#34;pimp.&#34; Andre La Cosse is a designer of web-sites for call girls. Andre also helps set up their &#34;meets&#34; and collects a fee for the service. Andre is accused of murdering a call girl (Gloria Dayton) that used to be a client of Mickey some 10 years ago. This should cause a conflict but Mickey agrees to take the case because he is convinced of Andre's innocence and Gloria herself had recommended Mickey to Andre, should he ever need a lawyer.<br /><br />Mickey must vacate his Lincoln &#34;office&#34; and gather his troops led by Cisco and a sharp young lawyer named Julie Aronson and gather at a makeshift office in a building being rented out by a rock band. As the prosecution has strong evidence tying Andre to the murder, Mickey and his team try to find an alternate killer to tie to Gloria's murder. The more they investigate they find that everything may be tied to a Mexican drug lord sitting in prison that Gloria had helped to put away ten years prior. As they approach that angle other elements emerge and they find themselves in danger from those who want their investigation to cease.<br /><br />Written with Connelly's amazing style, the narrative draws readers in from the start and has the usual incredible courtroom exchanges that transport the reader right into the fray. The courtroom scenes are fairly intense and we get to see how when faced with an &#34;innocent&#34; client, Mickey gets more determined to succeed at all costs.<br /><br />As an aside in the tale, Mickey is struggling with trying to re-kindle his relationship with his estranged daughter who has cast Mickey aside because of someone he defended. His attempts to win her back go on throughout the tale and help bring some &#34;humanity&#34; to Mickey's sometimes devious character.<br /><br />This is not the best Lincoln Lawyer tale but it is a very good one

B00G5G7FL0|5.0|My husband and I took our kids to see this movie the day it arrived in theaters. Disney did a fantastic job and the music was superb. My young children were engaged the whole time and we all absolutely loved it! My kids want to go see it again!
B00ADS98FC|2.0|When I saw this movie on store shelves, I assumed it was yet another \\"High School Musical\\" knockoff -- and since that movie didn't exactly impress me, I avoided this one.  Only when a family member raved about the movie and told me it highlighted that oft-overlooked subgenre of music known as acapella, I decided to give it a shot.  I love acapella music, and was curious to see how this movie would portray it... as well as to hear the songs, especially those by an all-girl acapella group (a rarity in the genre).<br /><br />I came away from this movie rather disappointed.  Yes, the songs are fun and catchy, but the rest of the movie is a clich&eacute;d, over-the-top mess.  And it seems like the movie doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or play up the camp, and so settles for a whiplash-inducing mix of both.<br /><br />At first the movie starts to follow an all-female acapella group known as the Bellas, as they botch the finals of an intense competition by virtue of the soloist throwing up rather graphically onstage.  Then the movie instead switches to Becca, a reluctant college student who wants to be a DJ but is being pushed into school by her estranged father, who's paying her way through college.  When one of the Bellas overhears her singing in the shower, she convinces her to audition for the Bellas, and Becca makes the cut... only to find herself constantly at odds with Audrey, the Bellas' controlling leader who insists that they sing the same songs at every show despite said songs boring their audience to tears.  Becca unexpectedly warms up to the eclectic mix of girls among the Bellas, including a shy girl prone to whispering creepy phrases, a possible lesbian, and a girl who proudly dubs herself \\"Fat Amy\\" for obvious reasons.  But when Becca falls for a member of the Bellas' competition the Treblemakers, butts heads with Audrey one too many times, and has her dreams of DJ-hood dashed by her father, she finds herself cut off from her newfound friends... but is determined to help them make it to the finals anyhow.<br /><br />By far the best part of this movie is the songs.  While they're all covers, all the bands cover the songs well... and totally without instruments, relying on the human voice to provide vocals, accompaniment, and even drums.  Even if you're not a fan of acapella music, you'll enjoy these songs, which range from '80s to hits of the modern day.<br /><br />The storyline, if you couldn't tell from the above synopsis, is a mess.  The movie can't seem to decide if it's about the struggles of girl trying to follow her dreams despite pressure from others, or about a group of mismatched misfits trying to succeed.  It tries to be about both, and sadly both storylines suffer from the film trying to juggle both.  I would have much preferred it if the film had picked one or the other and focused on it.  And on a writing-related note, the humor seems to focus on either puns on the word \\"acapella\\" (\\"aca-awkward,\\" \\"aca-serious,\\" \\"aca-amazing,\\") etc., or on vomit jokes.  The former is far more eyeroll-inducing than funny, especially since the puns are delivered in perfect seriousness and without any hint of humor or irony... and the latter is just disgusting instead of funny.<br /><br />The characters are what really kill the movie for me.  They're all either incredibly bland (such as Becca's love interest) or, far more often, annoying to the point where they grate on the nerves.  Becca and her Korean roommate are unlikable, Fat Amy is far too over-the-top to be believable, the announcers of the competition have mean and nasty senses of humor, and Audrey and the male leader of the Treblemakers are both obnoxious and hateful characters.  In the case of the latter two I suppose one could make the argument that they're antagonists and are supposed to be obnoxious, but they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and that bothers me.  Even the love interest's nerdy roommate is bland, serving no point to the plot and having no personality outside his love of magic tricks and obsession with Star Wars and the Treblemakers.  The one character I liked was the shy, creepy girl, who has some of the best lines in the movie (though you have to turn on subtitles to understand what she's saying).<br /><br />I suggest passing on this movie and going for the soundtrack instead.  It's too adult-oriented for the \\"High School Musical\\" crowd, but is too clich&eacute;d and mean-spirited for most others to enjoy.ing no personality outside his love of magic tricks and obsession with Star Wars and the Treblemakers.

B00E4W40C4|5.0|Watched the 3d Blu-ray the 3d video is very good a bit dark sometimes but watchable,a particular shot I remember when Logan comes first time to meet Master Yashida at his house the rooms are shown in different layers which looks spectacular & of course there are many other good 3d shots, the DTS7.1 audio is simply awesome. Purchase recommended.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This game is wonderful it tests the player's and strengthens their minds. I just loved it, the music, games, and trials makes this games amazingly excellent. It should have five stars and a sequel!

B0052RCX0G|5.0|This book will change your entire perspective of what historical objects in a museum represent.  Neil MacGregor's discussion of each object is concise, well-written and often includes brief, but meaningful insights by an expert in an appropriate field.  As an example, Neil MacGregor transforms what on the surface appears to be a mundane Egyptian sculpture of cattle, to a discussion of the transformation of humans as hunter/gatherers to communities which could only exist with the domestication of crops and livestock.  In his concise discussion of that single object, Mr. MacGregor adds a very concise, clear discussion of the resulting geneology of modern cattle as from Asiatic origins and a brief discussion of the religious significance of cattle in some cultures.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What the heck happened with this third book???? As it stands right now, I am 64% of the way through this book and I cannot finish it. I have to say, I'm really disappointed. I had so much hope for this book, waited months and months for it to come out, and it just did not deliver. And I usually want to give books good ratings, but this time I just can't. The series itself had so much promise, but it doesn't live up to that promise. I can't put my finger on exactly why. The writing itself does not hold the reader's attention.<br /><br />At one point, I came on and read other people's reviews because I just couldn't get through the book, wondering if others were having the same issue. From what I can see, this isn't just my issue. Many are experiencing the same.<br /><br />Some people don't like how it ends and they have beef with what the writer did regarding that - but I can't even get there. I can't even get into the book enough to even care what Roth did with the ending. The writing is what's disappointing to me....not necessarily the choices the author made in the story itself or characters. The actual writing just fell apart.<br /><br />Big bummer. I was really looking forward to this....I really wanted to love this book. I wanted to come on here and leave 5 stars.<br /><br />What the heck happened with this book? I'm still scratching my head, wondering.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I chose this rating because it's sort of a good helpful dictionary. But I did not like how long it really was
1439102449|5.0|Very good as usual but I am running out of books to read in this series...I enjoy everyone of them!
B000007XUQ|5.0|The Carpenters were one of the best music groups of the 70's.  This 2 cd set has a lot of great songs.  Karen sings and Richard plays the piano.
B00BCK1A5G|4.0|One of my favourite books in the series. Kaleb has been a great character to follow throughout the series and his own book was well worth the wait.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Great CD for any Mariah Carey fan.  What a wonderful voice.  Old standards and new music mixed together for a great CD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has great graphics.Plus when you upgrade it ,it will give you new locations . It also quickens your reactions by the fast movement with the minion. THE MINIONS ARE FUNNY!!!!!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Lots of action.  A very good action movie if you are into action movies.  Very good computer generated tricks and more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game have me really using my brain. I got a little upset., because there wasn't any clues,but I got it. I can't wait for the other floors.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|i've enjoyed this app and all the sound options.  i like the sleep option where it times off.  very relaxing.
0062107313|4.0|I give this book three stars for story and 5 for writing. Tan's writing is up to par but the story just meanders too much without fully resolving satisfactorily at the end. I can tolerate an ambiguous ending but this book seemed to promise more but didn't deliver (which is disappointing). But for those who love Tan's previous books this book can be relished for the writing alone. If you don't expect a gripping tale you won't be too disappointed. My favorite book by this author is [[ASIN:B004IYISSK The Joy Luck Club]].
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|cute game with helpful hints.  wish it were longer.  no permissions required which is the way some apps should be.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Does not work keeps asking for Internet connection even though you are connected.I am a man of few words so do not like a limit on words
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I did not like the book, was porn and had no substance. Sorry I downloaded it. Fell for all the hype.
B0052GACNM|1.0|There were 2 CD's in the Duets II. However, only 1 CD was burned properly and the other had no sound. Hmmmm seems like it was a copy. I was ripped off!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Something new and different in the world of magic.  I did not see &#34;it&#34; coming. Great cast. Amazon is easy to use.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is what I play to relax and get some ME time. Try it I promise you will love it just as much as I do:)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great app. Loads of info if you want it and a quick clear summary if not. My favourite bit is the time required for a full charge taking into account current consumption.
0525478817|5.0|Holt McDougal is a name that will be remembered for years to come. Holt is one of the most versatile authors of our time--- in addition to writing your ordinary calculus and astronomy textbooks, he also dabbles in young adult fiction. He's been wildly successful in both genres (can i say his algebra 2 textbook was especially fascinating.) Next time you're looking for a good book, remember the name Holt McDougal. You won't be disappointed. DFTBA everybody
0374158460|5.0|This book changed my life. A wonderful, realistic story that explains why humanity is flawed, miserable, and ultimately, worthy of forgiveness.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Easy to lose track of time with this one!  Got it as a FAOTD.<br />Enjoy it a lot!  Hopefully they will add more levels soon.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved it!!  Intricately woven story-line that kept me wanting to come back for more...<br />The ending was a huge surprise!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|No better movie. (I was going to leave it at that but Amazon has a word limit that must be met.)
141694737X|5.0|This is by far one of my child's favorite books. My child loves opening the flaps to find each animal waiting inside! It's a quick read which keeps a child's attention and is liked so much, it's a book that is read over and over and over again! Bright and colorful illustrations with zoo animals behind each flap.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Enjoyed the second book even more!<br />I am sure the 3rd will be good too! Can't wait to read the ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well this book is very good. I would recommend this book for teens and up. Though I am ten I read it. No one should read it under 10 years old
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive but very fun to play. A huge challenge for sure if you are up to that sort of thing. Some games are easy....some not so much.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Wonderful movie.  All members of the family will love.  Easy to download digital copy.  Packaging was easy to open. Great for the library
B003KK65KG|5.0|Liked how you get the different perspective or points of view over the same tricky topic. Really Worth a read, specially if you are a parent. But if you are not (like me) it'll help you to be less judgmental.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|I liked this movie. Michelle Pfeiffer is really good in this movie and so is Robert De niro.  It makes for a clean, fun family movie.  I recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy, fiction and action comedies.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game because its just like Mario Bros!!! Mario has aways been my favorite game but now l have found this game!!!!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|have read this book many times and each time i enjoy it more  would reccomend it to anyone great auther
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Absolutely addicted to this series. Top notch acting, plot, writing, setting - doesn't get any better! The following seasons can't come soon enough.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Epic telling of a classic comic-book tale.  The story behind Superman proved to be fascinating, for even a couple who had no background in comic books.  I can't speak to the accuracy of the storyline to the original, but it was very well done.  Fight scenes were incredible.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I purchased each season - and have the new one on hold.<br />The characters, plots, costumes, all just wonderful.<br />It is a treat to see how the characters become more human... you dislike one, then they redeem themselves...<br />just like life... Love to watch with family for an entire afternoon -- ALL seasons.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|REad all 5 books. Never know what is going to happen. Heros to villains and vice versa. I hope there is going to be a 6th
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love ALL the Downton's so far. I have the next season ordered already.<br />Again, I love it for when I want to watch when I do not have internet access.<br />I love the Downton's have helped keep the castle in better shape as well.<br />I will visit it next time I go 'across the pond' for a vacation.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|Had no expectations so it was better than thought. Kept us laughing and entertained. Worth watching for a good laugh.
0316017930|5.0|Great book and interesting perspective on the true causes behind some social and societal phenomenons.  If you enjoy mental stimulation, you'll love this book
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Nothing very surprising with this new version; it's nice to have a new set of levels, but the basic game is the same.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I am a sucker for point-and-click adventures.  TAoM hits all the bases:<br />1. User-friendly inventory (I hate when I can't figure out how to collect or use items)<br />2. Good screen interface (Some games make it so if you are one pixel away from your target, you can't do anything)<br />3. Challenges are interesting but not frustrating (I hate games where all the challenges are math problems)<br />4. Easy to access hint feature (nice to get just the hint you need without spoiling the game, or having to watch 10 minutes of walkthrough to get the info you need)<br />5. Beautiful scenery (I tend to play the darker horror-themed games, but this one was very nice)<br />All in all an excellent game.
B007Z5WMCW|1.0|The number of available stations that I could view and understand were not worth the space it occupied, so I removed it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|It was great! Both me and my mom play these games by the company really enjoy them. We hope that there will be more!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Landay's writing is superb: I couldn't stop reading nor imagining such a shocking ending. It raises many moral questions that no parent should ever ponder, but I guess that's what makes this such a powerful book.
B000M343BM|5.0|Very enjoyable movie. Arrived in good condition and quickly after the order date. It is a movie that will make you laugh.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Sorry I know most of my friends have read  it and loved it I got board couldn't wait till I finished it
B000WCDBKM|5.0|Very enjoyable and easy to get immersed. The plot is well paced and Depp's character is well supported by talented people. The sets, lighting and locations are well done and the movie seems well edited. The entire production is a subtle yet great work of entertainment if not art. Some touches I liked were the very subtle CGI reflections in the glasses and windows were tastefully done. Many things allowed you to use your imagination to complete a scene much better than any staged act. Roman Polanski is a professional I respect and this work is one of the many reasons why.  Emmanuelle Seigner was most interesting in the movie with her enigmatic role. Divinely worth owning and seeing over and over.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I liked the first two books better but couldn't imagine not reading this one.  Makes for a fun quick read.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|A straight forward, old school, puzzle adventure game. Puzzles can be difficult but there is an easy to use hint system. Nice music.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Excellent album. Good recording too. If you are a long time fan then you know they always deliver whats expected
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Wish it wasn't fee to play but you can do more than most games like this if you are patient.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series. I love the cast of characters. Maggie Smith is wonderful. The writing is superb. It is interesting to take a peek at this era from the perspectives of the both the aristocracy and the serving class.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great story,it has good actors and keeps you hooked. I cant wait for season four in January
B000YHE4AG|3.0|A cute story sure to please kids of all ages. It's fun to watch with the kids at Christmas, but sorry to say, I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|The movie was good it just had too much bad language through the entire movie. This movie was strikingly similar to Men in Black but with bad language. I will not buy this movie due to the languge.
B00BK5D95C|2.0|I must say that I foolishly bought the Awesome Wave album simply because the songs sounded pretty; of course, it's impossible to understand more than half the words said in any given song without looking up the lyrics. Notably, I probably should have before having funded this band; songs about gang rape and murder by broom up the &#34;snatch,&#34; songs about adultery, songs about... just, ugh. This band might have a decent sound but I can't possibly listen to these atrocious songs knowing what they're about. That you could even put such puzzles of disgusting words and references into such pleasant melodies baffles me. I wholeheartedly regret buying this album.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Great story.... great casting.... loved it!!  Loved the ending.... just like Cinderella.  I could watch it over and over again
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing Solitaire because it makes me feel less rushed and I love playing card games!  Solitaire requires concentration and a sharp eyes for spotting on which cards to pick out.
1423113462|5.0|Rick Riordan’s most popular series is the Percy Jackson series. After it ended, the world asked Riordan for more books in Percy’s world.  Riordan’s response was a new story, introducing new characters and an exciting plot.  The Heroes of Olympus is my favorite series, and its first installation, “The Lost Hero”, is one of the best books I’ve read this year.<br /> “The Lost Hero” takes place a few months after the final book in the Percy Jackson series.  Jason wakes up on a school bus filled with kids, holding hands with a girl that he’s never met, and the only thing that he can remember is his name.  His girlfriend, Piper and his best friend, Leo tell Jason that they are students at Wilderness School, a school for “bad kids”.  After being attacked by Venti (storm spirits), a chariot arrives to take them to a place called Camp-Half Blood.  Once they arrive, they find out that they are demigods, half mortal and half god.  After a night of being at the camp, they are assigned a quest that will challenge Jason, Piper, and Leo in more ways than one.<br /> The setting of a story can sometimes be hard to envision.  But Riordan made the setting clear as day in the story, using many vivid details to help me envision wherever they were.  The setting takes place in many cities in North America.  Chicago, Quebec, San Francisco, and Detroit are some of them.  In these cities they crash land into an abandoned factory, stumble across a sewer, and find King Midas’ house.  The setting is in modern day which I think is really cool, considering that Riordan puts Greek and Roman mythology with it.<br /> The book is told from the three main character’s points of view.  You can tell because they way that they narrate the story is very different.  Leo tells the story with a lot of humor and will cracks jokes during a serious part of the story. He usually tries to make everyone laugh during a stressful time, like after they were attacked by the Venti, Leo asks, “Can we just call them stormspirits? Venti makes them sound like evil espresso drinks.”  Piper kind of panics and Jason is the calm, cool leader that freaks out on the inside.<br /> Overall, this book is one of my favorites because of it’s action, humor, and storytelling.  I think that kids from 7 or 8 and older can read this book.  It’s got some fighting and talks of killing so it probably isn’t appropriate for little kids. But there isn’t anything too inappropriate in the book so older kids could read it.<br /> This book is one of the best books that there is for it being a children’s book. The characters are relatable and it’s just a good book in general.  This series should have more followers than it already has. It’s a great read.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|Even though I am a vegetarian, I find Hambo to be filled with mazes with strategies that need to be solved in order for Hambo to find his friend Bacon.<br /><br />As for the fun aspect of this game, it keeps on my toes, and it makes me think faster!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Love this game can play for hours. Highly recommend this. Great graphics and smooth gameplay. Lots of characters to choose from and pins are easy to gain.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|It's Michael Buble -- what more can I say. He could sing the phone book and I would buy it.  He sings beautifully and I really like the songs.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I do not like the way it makes me buy time so I can keep playing.....I won't do it.  that crying clock I find VERY annoying.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome!!!! This game was really fun, you have to use your mind on some of the game, but the graphics are awesome!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Having seen the mighty Hammer of the Gods at least a dozen times live in their heyday - and being one who would have literally paid tens of thousands to be at the O2 if I could have - it is needless to say that the arrival of this box set into my man cave many months ago was a heralded event. When it arrived - I disappeared for a weekend with enough food and alcohol to get me through the event numerous times. We waited many years for Jimmy and company to perfect this - and the fact that they were even doing it was kept well under wraps. Sure - I had most of the bootlegs of the O2 event. One had to wonder how they would fix the feedback issues plainly heard on all of the bootlegs. But once you sit down with this Blu-Ray - you understand why it took nearly 5 years to get it out after the show. It becomes readily apparent that this release is intended to be the exclamation point - and the period - to this bands legacy - and the level of intricate care in it's production is proof of that.<br /><br />I was able to enjoy this shortly after building the home theater system of my dreams - perfect timing.  The DTS-HD audio is nearly perfect in every way.  There is little trace of the feedback issues that plagued the live event - a testament to the amount of time spent mixing and correcting the live recording. The sound stage delivered is a perfect balance of directly recorded instruments with enough live feel for the arena - something many live recordings miss the mark on. This concert is the tightest I have ever seen them play - the amount of rehearsal and sober preparation was plainly evident.  Speaking of rehearsals - the box set includes a great recording of their final dress rehearsal before the O2 event - recorded from a single unmanned camera at the rear of the room - with an awesome sound mix. And yes - they played some of the numbers better in that rehearsal (Dazed and Confused) than they did at the O2.  It was fun to watch - made you feel like one of the &#34;roadies&#34; helping to prep for the event - the proverbial fly on the wall.<br /><br />I have been a professional video producer and live event production manager for thirty years.  There has been some criticism of the video editing style - and I have to admit that my first few passes through the DVD left me feeling that the pace of the editing detracted from the show.  But then - it grew on me - and the more I watched it - the more I realize that there was so much good material to work with, that eliminating those cuts would have robbed us all from seeing the true magic behind this show. Subtle glances between the band members - body language - audience reaction - mixed in with Super8mm film clips intentionally interspersed with sparkling HD footage. What?? - Super 8mm film clips - why?  Because - it depicts Zeppelin - how they look now in sparkling HD - and how they were recorded in yesteryear - all mixed together - a little bit of the past with a blast from the present - PERFECT!  Every time I watch it - I catch something new.  Every time I watch it - I am transported back to the Long Beach Arena in June of 1972 - but it sounds WAY better than it did back then.<br /><br />I can Ramble On about this for hours - but it all pales when you get to Kashmir.  This is the best performance of this epic song by Zeppelin ever to be captured.  I must admit that I fell to my knees and nearly wept when I first heard it.  For any Zeppelin fan - hearing this cut on this Blu-Ray is a must - and crank it up - to hell with the neighbors!<br /><br />Obviously - I can not recommend this highly enough. I am in some ways saddened to think that this may be the mighty Zeps swan song - but what a beautiful way to go.  Buy two - you may want to be buried with one copy and leave the other in your will :-)
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Fantastic engrossing story. A great read. The story is well told and reveals each new character and twist just as you need them
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you've figured it out, what you think is only a fragment of what's actually going on. Great read and definitely a book that stays with you. Hopefully the movie will do it justice.
B00G70JQZC|5.0|Loved the series of XMen. I recommend this move to all Xmen fans. You will not be disappointed. It is also kid friendly as well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hot mess. Christian's controlling and Ana's a weak-minded, insecure female and if I read another 'Oh My' or 'Mighty Fine...' like who talks like this? Not any 20-something I know. This book so unrealistic. Reading it is like peeling wallpaper.
B00005JNJV|5.0|the begining of the batman saga that take the bat from the obsecurity of the the bat mipples throws all of that out and starts anew with a great actor, great crew and great director.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Good book. The author has a lot of demons to wrestle with and she chooses to do it on the Pacific Crest Trail. Can't wait to see the movie!
B008JFURKG|4.0|let me say this is a good sequel to the movie i liked alot a while back and the inclusion of Kathrine zeta Jones, and anthony hopkins to the cast as well as mary louise parker being more than a damsel in distress is great could have some better extras for the blu ray but all in all a good movie
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I like YouTube I go on it about but I got a kindle fire so then I downloaded this youtube app it's a good app I go on it a bunch
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a great game. I heard so much about it and did not think it could be that great but is way better!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is very addictive and hard to stop playing. The levels need a lot of think and at time is very hard to solve,which means you will be stuck on this game for a while. Worth the $1.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Probably not going to make him any new fans, but for longtime followers, it's a captivating entry into his already unique discography.
B009C7JS14|3.0|settings work well. updates fast. info packed. easy to use.  uses little data. fast .awesome backdrop. this was my review.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Really fun and a good way to pass the time, especially on a kindle when you can't get an app for castleville. Love it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love this product for streaming Netflix from my laptop and streaming Pandora from my Android Phone.<br /><br />Waiting for them to fix Netflix Android app as only the main account can sign on.  Netflix looses the Joe Cool factor for that and you can't just automatically send the stream to the Chromecast from your laptop.  It loads it on the laptop and then you have the opportunity to send to the Chromecast.  Final software flaw when using a Chrome Browser and sending it to the ChromeCast, the Mouse does not show up on the big screen at all.  Software updates have been coming out but it needs some tweaking.<br /><br />Install can be a little frustrating because the first handshake takes its own sweet time.  Installed 3 of these and they all keep saying can't find it ... just have to keep trying until it does. (about three times or so).  Also,  it comes with an AC adaptor, use it, DO NOT try plugging it into the USB on TV or IT WILL FRY the Chromecast Unit.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love the twists and turns Mitch's books take, always to the place least expected. The story line is amazingly creative! The lesson learned? Well, I will let you read it and make your own determination. Suffice it to say I will live each of my days with more care and gratitude.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Giant robots punching monsters.<br /><br />Either that makes you desperately want to see this movie (and at this point, you've probably already seen it), or you've got a puzzled look on your face.  If the latter, move along, nothing to see here.  You will not get deep characters, Oscar winning performances, or amazing twists that boggle your mind.<br /><br />You will get giant robots punching monsters.  For some of us, that is enough.
B000FA675C|4.0|It was very interesting with lots of drama. I had heard alot about this book and finally felt good to read it.
B00B1RB942|5.0|Forget Makoto Shinkai's desktop screensavers masquerading as feature films...Mamoru Hosoda is the true spiritual and artistic successor to the great Hayao Miyazaki.  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time followed by Summer Wars followed by Wolf Children simply show this director's progression of maturity in storytelling and visual splendor.  I encourage any fan of art, film, and anime to add all three of these gems to your collections and to follow Hosoda's career henceforth with gusto.
B0083SF0FG|5.0|This set is a gift for my daughter for Christmas - as she LOVES this series! Great price for 8 seasons! Very pleased!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so fun, all the cute little dragons.. it also teaches kids how to use their money for when they get older! ( Even is im a billionaire and unwisely use my bling) ^w^ rawr
1451666179|5.0|I freakin' LOVE this book.<br />1. it's hilarious<br />2. it's color coded<br />3. buy it.<br />4. read it<br />5. fall in love with the silly noodle monster that is Allie Brosh
1250038820|5.0|Humans of New York is really like a Minitrip to the Big Apple. No other book that I know of tells so many little stories at once and brings you the people who live there any closer. This book is a love declaration to people who all have hopes dreams and fears, different and yet the same. Read it and learn about all those people who all have a story. Travel to New York and who knows, you might run into Brandon Stanton and end up being photographed yourself.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book I enjoyed the second book more then the first. It dived in depth into a different better side of the characters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that this app allows me to keep track of so many locations at the same time - and the hour by hour/day by day charts... It's very easy to use and very convenient
B0018OFN1S|5.0|Rest in peace, Paul Walker.<br /><br />You were taken from us too early. To those who knew you, you were a charismatic, down-to-earth, friendly guy; you made an indelible impression on those you met. To the millions who know you from movies, you were a cool, funny, intense actor with a winning smile.<br /><br />You may not have been the most versatile or talented of actors, but you were always the heart and soul of your movies. You were the emotional core of the Fast and Furious franchise, the everyman in Eight Below, the riveting protagonist of Running Scared.<br /><br />You gave to charity, you posed for pictures, you were a role model for fans. You were a great guy who never got caught up in the celebrity image. The action world will never be the same without you. Yours is a hole that can never be filled.<br /><br />We miss you, Paul. Our prayers to your wife and daughter.<br /><br />Paul Walker (1973 - 2013).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was poorly written. It needed more of a plot. Just not my kind of a book. I wouldn't recommend it.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Contrived storyline. Action scenes were very well done, but storyline was contrived to facilitate the action scenes, and fully unrealistic as well. Wasn't sorry I viewed it, but it wasn't as good as previous Mission Impossible movies. Somehow I think writers think up a sequence of over-the-top action scenes, then tie them together with a weak unrealistic storyline.
0316055433|3.0|It's been a long time since I found a book so alternately beautiful and maddening. There are excellent scenes and lines in this novel, and I'm glad I read it, but it doesn't hold together well. In the end it reminded me of the antique shop the character Hobie runs in the book: many amazing, high-quality things half-hidden beneath mounds of less interesting stuff.<br /><br />Tartt deserves credit for daring greatly in this book. It's hard to center a long novel on a fairly unlikeable character, and even harder when that character is also the narrator. In Theo Decker I felt she was trying to get at the ways a severe psychic injury plays out over a lifetime, and for the first half of the book I was fascinated by Theo even when I didn't like him. And Tartt does lay the groundwork carefully for his later misdeeds, particularly in Theo's unwanted resemblance to his father. But once Theo becomes an adult (in years if not in maturity), he makes so many stupid decisions, and is so apathetic about his life generally, that it got increasingly difficult for me to care what happened to him. It's also hard to reconcile how Theo can act as he does while having the insights he articulates. I understand that this is part of what Tartt is trying to explore (why people don't do what they know, at some level, they should do), but I don't think it quite comes off here. Theo's character felt too inconsistent to sustain the whole novel.<br /><br />The high points of the novel for me were Theo's life immediately after the explosion that kills his mother, when he is taken in by the wealthy family of a school friend, and his relationship with Hobie, the furniture dealer who takes him on as a kind of apprentice. As in &#34;The Secret History,&#34; Tartt excels in showing the dark underside of wealth and privilege, and it wasn't a surprise when members of the wealthy family turn up later in Theo's life and play some decisive roles. As for Hobie, I wanted to read a whole novel about him, because the portions that describe his sense for furniture and his love for the past were some of the strongest in the book. Boris, the Russian-born friend Theo makes during his sojourn in Las Vegas with his gambler father, is also a vivid character, and I appreciated that Tartt took his character in directions I didn't expect.<br /><br />It's the ending (and by &#34;ending&#34; I mean about the last 200 pages) that was the real problem for me. The violence and cross-continents chase scenes just didn't ring true. This part of the book, in which more &#34;happens&#34; in plot terms, was actually the hardest to get through. Tartt excels at rendering the inner lives of characters, but the action scenes fall flat.<br /><br />I hate giving this novel a mediocre rating, because I appreciate the ambition it embodies and the parts of it in which Tartt's prose really sings. She's engaging some important questions about the power of art in this book, and the scenes that feature Theo thinking through his relationship with the purloined painting were moving and thought-provoking. The novel as a whole just doesn't measure up to its best components, sadly.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I thought this was the movie, but was gravely disappointed to discover it was just the trailer. I don't remember it being declared that in it's write-up on Amazon Instant Video. I think it's wrong to represent movie trailers as movies, and this should be pulled from Amazon's movie listings. If Amazon wants it can provide another category that contains only movie trailers. This, of course, is not a review of the movie &#34;King's Speech.&#34;
B005PK57IK|3.0|Way above average soap. Excellent cameos. Legal details somewhat questionable.<br />Overall, very engaging and diverting.<br />Worth the time spent watching.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|At first it wouldn't donload or open but when it did it is the best hunting game out there. It  is good.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very good story. Kind of sad tho. I found the writing.....beginning of the chapters different from other books I have read.  Enjoyed the book very much.
B00GN76K4Y|5.0|This is the best game there is on the kindle. When you get one character you can easily get more good ones.
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|No matter what, Andre Rieu always meets the expectations.<br />Only concern is that the website should mention if a DVD really is suitable for US standards.
B006B7LQ90|5.0|Amazing insights on the way consumers really see brands like. It's a concept that revolutionized branding all over the world.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It's great entertainment for the whole family!  We all find it very challenging and a great way to work together.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is an excellent time killer. Once you start playing you don't want to stop. The only thing I don't like is that the extras are way too expensive.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Great book. I think this book works more for software companies but there is much intelligence in how they challenged corporate bureaucracy vs. what it actually takes to get the work done.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I love this movie and adore Jim Caviezel. I enjoyed his charator. Tough with a sensitive side. lol I definitely give the movie and Jim 5 stars. :0)
B00CBT04LI|4.0|John Carpenter's The Thing is an undisputed classic. Now it's a two volume classic. While the 1982 version had an obvious opening for a prequel, the bar for any attempt was high. Not only would it be hard to tell an equally compelling story, but keeping continuity with and maintaining loyalty to the first narrative would be a huge challenge. The first few scenes hinted at a too-modern &#34;assemble your team&#34; phase, but the cast quickly snuggled in for the more appropriate confinement of the trapped with the beast theme. I was also worried because the first half of the movie feels like a beat-for-beat pretreatment of the events of the Kurt Russell version, but at a pivotal scene the new protagonist comes up with a different solution to the problem of isolating the alien and from then on everything is fresh, exploring more backstory and frightening consequences of the creature's nature. Best of all, I can't think of a single loose thread in continuity. Everything seen in the Norwegian base in 1982 is explained (though occasionally in haste) in this film. The bottom line is that this prequel makes the original seem like a sequel. If only every reboot, remake, and follow up could fit so well, I'd be much happier at the box office! If you are a fan of the Carpenter classic or like adventure, horror, or sci-fi, go see this in the theater! BTW â&#34; why are helicopter pilots always the most bad ass members of remote outpost staffs?
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Loved this movie with the twists that made it a must see again. DiCaprio did a wonderful job in his role. The music and the manner of the filming created a space for actually being able to feel every scene.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Pixar continues to iterate on a winning formula with this sequel. It has all the fun of its predecessors and plenty of surprises. The cast is simplified to make room for an even more mature story, but the favorites who remain draw the viewer in with convincing jeopardy and rich personal arcs. Who thought it would be so easy to relate to a piece of plastic? Toy Story 3 combines the innocent joy of the original and the serious undertones of WALLâ€¢E, culminating in a profound finale. It's all you'd expect from Pixar and a must-see for everyone!
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Very cool seeing this group back together again. If you enjoyed the first, you will like this one. Fast Moving.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Any serious fan of the original will be able to stay one scene ahead and one act ahead of this whole movie, but that doesn't mean it's not awesome! Even the plot elements lifted from the original series are twisted and retold in ways that are a joy to see play out. There's even more fan service in the details than in Abrams' first adventure - including at least one nod to the ill-received Enterprise TV show. There's action at the expense of story and yet there's still a lot of character development for such an ensemble. A shame they'll never be as tight as Shatner's without weekly appearances. All Trek and action fans should take the time to see this.
0385537131|5.0|John Grisham just gets better and better as he writes this very involved legal drama.  It is a page turner from start to finish.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Iron Man 3 manages to be both very aware of The Avengers and prove that Marvel's character films can thrive post-mash-up. This film is the best yet, building character (including best to date use of Jarvis), justifying the absence of other supers, bringing a great plot (that fuses many concepts from the comics), more (amd more seamless) humor, and delivers it all with phenomenal action (autonomous suits are over the top, but made up for by stellar delivery of more Downey performance with out of suit and partial suit fights). A must for any Marvel or cinema fan!
0316069485|5.0|Michael Connelly just gets better and better at his mystery, drama series.  Great book.  I highly recommend it from start to finish.
0385350864|5.0|I truly hear all of you who say that you couldn't get past the first few chapters with her toy boy and twitter. But if you stick with it, you may find it's worth it. I did, and I was skeptical for the first few chapters, too. The toy boy turns out to be thoughtful and kind. There's another surprise new romance (no, not leatherjacketman from the first few chapters), and the new man is older, kind, mature, and quite yummy. I still couldn't (and can't in real life) get into twitter and Bridget's twitter obsession. In the end I came to think that a plotline that simply picked up where the last book left off would be maybe banal (Bridget and Darcy fight about preschools) or maybe disappointing (Bridget gets caught up in babies/shopping/school madness). I did see growth in Bridget, as she struggles and becomes confident in love, especially in loving and raising her children.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Thought it was great, other than the ending. I am afraid I kept waiting for more to happen and was disapointed. Overall, a great series.
B008LXZEYU|5.0|it's ridiculous and funny and has become a &#34;classic&#34; in our house and with our teenage children.  We saw a slight difference in this version and the purchased dvd.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Sadly, this is the first book I have quit reading since Hawthorne in high school. Bloated, indulgent, and tiresome, King's work of late cries out for a good editor to hack away the extraneous BS that clutters his storylines. King is a master storyteller, and there are glimmers of the book that may have been with more disciplined writing, but the result here is a snooze. As a longtime fan, I'm hoping he'll get his mojo back.
B000SW4DXK|3.0|I thought I was ordering the original movie, not the remake. Although the remake was good it, it was not as good as the original.  If someone had never seen the original they would not be disappointed though.
B000002AH1|3.0|While I love Bitches Brew, this sister album has only small sections that I like.  It has a heaviness to it, a lack of beauty, and just goes straight for a kind of soulless funk-rock-jazz fusion.  I listened to it many times and still think it fails completely.  I would recommend this only for collectors.  No one I know can enjoy it.<br /><br />This was one of the first albums I got out of boredom with 70s rock - I thought, electric jazz might be more interesting and make me look cool in high school.  We soon were all listening to it.  Frankly, I think this represents one of the worst offshoots of jazz, fusion, even though a big argument in favor of it is how experimental and innovative it was.  But really, the music isn't good.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|The movie was ok I really liked Brad in it but it reminded me to much of I am Legend.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Excellent character development combined with often gritty insight into the realities of street lawyering... an exceptionally pleasant reading experience. Delightful.
B000IEXVCC|2.0|No real reason, just was not my kind of movie...may be one of those you need to watch several times.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Two of my favoite men. Connelly is always a good read and Harry Bosch is a fun, colorful character with real human weaknesses.
B0012NVGHU|1.0|Movie dragged, 1-dimensional. Acting was pretty good, but story line was, well, just slow. Thought we would watch this prior to a trip to NY where we thought we might see the play.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Interesting account of a very difficult, and usually misunderstood, job. Thank goodness there are people willing to do this job so the rest of us can read Kindle books in safety.
B0007M22TI|5.0|They have the voices and sounds of angels. it would be interesting to buy one of their Christmas music CDs
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE this game! was so happy to find it for my kindle fire. I think it is a Must Have.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Just a great game! Wouldn't change a thing. I first played this game on FB and was so very happy when it came out on the kindle.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|After getting a new Samsung S4, I found that the app will not play sound for more than about one hour. I have the paid version. Developer was unresponsive when contacted about another,unrelated, performance issue.  If the free version works for you, stick with that, but don't spend any money on the full version.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game is stupid!!!! And I have a BRILLIANT reason why. Takes forever to load! The only reason I keep this app is because my friend has it. So, I DO NOT recommend this app!
1557048630|5.0|My son loves this book, so do I. There is a little history about design decisions and a lot of sketches.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I found this book to be extremely engaging. It only took me around 2 weeks to finish it (with just a bit of reading time at bedtime). I recommend for anyone who is a fan of scifi.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app has it all. Even a little help if you need it. Good instructions. Personalize your own playing cards. Compete against yourself for best scores or play with someone else.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Perfect Album... Best one in galaxy and time... Lady Gaga did it: Cannot stop listening it!!! Love it so much..
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was an excellent read.  Spellbinding and well written, as were all his previous works.<br />  Hosseini is a master story teller.
1603429999|5.0|Boy, how did I knit without this book!  I have only read 1/4 of it but it has helped me and I just love it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Couldn't put it down  I wish Jack Reacher could be a player in the \\" knock out\\" game!!!!!<br />We would be satisfied!!!
0545626382|5.0|I don't really know why I'm writing a review since there's more than 5,000 but I'll just add my 'two cents' in lol<br />The Hunger Games trilogy, the whole series, is soooo good.  All I want to do is keep reading the series again and again!! It'll make you laugh out loud, and you'll also be able to sympathize with the characters. Katniss is such a strong character, she's an inspiration!<br />The movies are great too- I can't wait until Mockingjay comes out!!<br />Go read these books, will ya?<br />:)
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Fantastic movie that addresses a social issue that impacts lives in a negative fashion. Great graphics I could watch this one again.
B008JFUOWM|5.0|R.I.P Paul Walker . you will always in our hearts, you were a great actor in fast & furious movies, they will always be the best films of all times . you will be missed everyday
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love this.  Had great fun recently with guests who wanted to show youtube videos.  The only problem is it only displays youtube, netflix and hulu.  (they might have added one more recently)  The good news is, as they add new services, they will come available on my device!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever made-in the history of world movie making.  The plot is as good as any plot ever written and the cast gives one of the best performances in Hollywood history.  Of course you have seen this movie-one of the most famous in modern movie history.  You have not?  I only have two questions for you.  What planet did you come from?  And, did you come in peace?
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Amazing cast performances - intense sets, diverse characters, only for mature audiences.  Jessica Lange is superb!  Can't wait for the next season
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|This movie, released in 1960, written by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, is one of the greatest love stories ever filmed.  Shirley Maclaine and Jack Lemmon play two people who have had bad luck in their love lives.  They come to realize, over the course of this movie, that life is just not worth living without the other one.  It is the most \\"real\\" love story I have ever seen and absorbs the viewer in the plot as only a great movie can.  If you have not seen this movie, you are depriving yourself of one of the greatest movie experiances possible-if you have seen this movie you already have this DVD.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Really like this unit.  I hesitated to buy for some time, but glad I finally did.  I also have the Roland-Octacapture which is superior in sound quality and input/output options, but the Octacapture is at a radically different price-point so that is understandable.  My problem was that I use many different softwares to prototype music.  Many demanding software programs demand exclusive use of the Octacapture.  Although the Octacapture has 8 inputs and outputs, those inputs and outputs are all physical electrical ins & outs.  It is a different story when we consider USB-inputs and outputs, the digital ins & outs.<br /><br />Turns out that the Octacapture, with it special patented cutting edge technology can only accept ONE USB-input and output at a time.  It refuses to share when the client software is a heavy-hitter like Cakewalk-Sonar, PG-Music-Band-in-a-Box or ImageLine-FL-Studio or such.  I have found that, with minor client software, the Octacapture has no issues with multiple clients or in other words multiple USB-inputs/outputs.  However, this means when I run Sonar, I cannot not run Band-in-a-Box simultaneously and output them both through the Octacapture.<br /><br />This led me to want a second Audio Interface which is this Focusrite Scarlett 2i2.  This unit is very good and I am happy that I discovered it by reading these Amazon Reviews like this one that I am writing.  That is why I am writing this one.<br /><br />Because the Scarlett 2i2 is not as complex as the Octacapture, it does not have the same problems hosting more that one software client even if they are the heavy-hitters.  But I do not have to do that because now I have more than one USB-digital output anyway.<br /><br />The sound is great, not up to the Octacapture standard, but not in the same price-league either.  The Scarlett 2i2 is stable, never have seen it crash or glitch out.  The sound is clean.  Happy I bought it.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|You need to be an Arnold fan for this one.  I liked the movie.  I am not sure if I need to see it more than once every few months, but it was enjoyable.  I bought it used from Amazon, so I am not too concerned about the cost.
B004AQR24W|5.0|Great movie. The best of the best are in it. A lot of action. The movie has lots of action and a little comedy
B00A757EFW|2.0|it's to hard to try and control the pac-man. yor finger covers him up, so it is impossible to see where he is turning
B007THA4FI|1.0|This story is very dark. Not as entertaining at all. I finished it in hopes that there would be something to lighten it, but it was a waste of time. J. K. Rowling should go back to stories like Harry Potter.
B00CN3U8TA|5.0|This is a spectacular figure. The face sculpt is a great likeness of Chris Helmsworth. I think the overall sculpt and design rivals the original Thor Movie Figure. This one is definitely bigger. The paint is also pretty flawless. Thor 2 was a MUCH BETTER movie than Thor. It looks like the figures mirror the difference as well. Thor's legs don't articulate that well. You won't get him in a crouching pose. But, I bent his knees a little, and spread his stance to give him a profound action pose. He's very steady, with his hammer ready behind/over his head. He looks GREAT on my shelf with the other Avengers! This was a great purchase.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Wow.  Fantastic script, acting, and soundtrack.  There are a lot of reviewers who think this movie is too slow or boring.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  I was glued to it.  I'm not an economist or a trader, but I know enough to know this is an important movie.  &#34;You're a lucky man.  You could have been digging ditches this whole time.&#34;  &#34;Yeah, but then at least there would be a few holes to show for it.&#34;<br /><br />There are no guns in this movie so I suppose a lot of people won't like it.  But there is plenty of drama.  This is a film for thinking people.  Or people who question authority.  Or people who question history, monetary policy, or corporatism.  You won't get the answers though.  And that's okay.<br /><br />This is a fictional film about the beginning of the Great Recession.  It was a necessary film.  An important film.  And it was very well executed.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Pretty cool. The first of its kind.<br />I'm still not sure if it is a day of its own way.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Because to finish the game I would need to invite someone else to play.  Did not wish to do that
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was living on Himmel Street while I was reading this book. That's how captivating it is. I'm always disturbed when reading about Nazi Germany,but never have I been transported in to the broken lives of the citizens who resided there. I leave this book heartbroken, and I can't imagine how a film could do this book justice.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|Susan Boyle's new Christmas album is perfect!  Her voice is crystal clear and fits this style beautifully.  I am so glad I purchased this MP3 album.  She is a gem!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|As usual a great book by Nicholas Sparks.  Look forward to reading more of his books and enjoying his style.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|I just saw this movie with my granddaughter we love it so much before we were out of the movie theater . I bought and downloaded the album so we could listen to it on the way home..... excellent music fantastic movie Sheri Usher
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A truly hauntingly sad story of devastation, love and hope told through a most unusual narrator during World War ll. Death, words, music, trust and love become integral to the story, in addition to the primary character, Leisel. Perhaps this theme still resonates with people due to the fact words still hold that same power today but are often used through a different medium.
B00A83075M|5.0|saw this in the movie theater, really enjoyed it much more than i thought going in.. actually made me tear up at the end.. happy watery eyes, of course. :) was excellent and i wanted my nephew to see it so i bought this for him for christmas, so he hasnt opened it yet, but i know hell love it. thanks!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|As an old gamer I want flashier rewards, but the speed keeps me going. It is great spatial logic practice for kids though.
B008602KQI|5.0|love, love, love everything about this movie. just saw the second one in theaters the other day. this trilogy is/will be one of my all time favorites. i will always watch this. katniss and peeta and gale and primrose.. all these names are freaking cool. guess in the future they had no use for traditional, ordinary names.. thank god. lenny kravitz is in this, too. a lot of great actors spice this movie up. this movie is jam packed with action and has such an interesting story. one for the history books, thats for sure!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|If you have read the author's A Time To Kill, you'll be familiar with the location of the story and the main characters.  Sycamore Row occurs a few years after A Time To Kill.<br /><br />Numerous Mississippi lawyers line up on opposing sides of a large estate battle.  There are two conflicting wills and a lot of money involved, so there are  lawyers `coming out of the woodwork' trying to get a piece of it.<br /><br />There's also some complicated detective work :  tracking down long-lost relatives and piecing together a very fragmented family tree.<br /><br />Having watched the movie version of A Time To Kill, I liked that I was able to envision the characters that carried-over to Sycamore Row (like Jake and Lucien and several others).<br /><br />Overall though, I thought this story got bogged-down and I did a lot of skimming to get to the end.  Way too many lawyers to keep track of........way too much complicated family tree.......way too much courtroom detail....... and way too many pages.<br /><br />Like A Time To Kill, I think this book will also make a good movie (once the movie editors cut the story down to size).
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|:)great flick. i love these two actors.. they were in something else, too.. cant remember the name, but they were both in a mental institution and i thought they had great chemistry. glad to see them in another movie together. this was silly, serious, down to earth, and annoying. i hate the ending, but nothing ever goes as planned.. thats life.. :)
B0093WVND4|5.0|Great book for a class discussion about 'stealing'.  A good book for character traits lessons.  You will enjoy reading &#34;Fantastic Mr. Fox&#34; because he really is a fantastic fox!

B000002LMK|5.0|Another one of Neil Young's 4 &#34;must own&#34; Albums alongside &#34;Tonight's The Night&#34;, &#34;Zuma&#34; & &#34;On The Beach.&#34; On the other hand, pretty much all Neil Young Albums are &#34;must owns&#34; though, right…lol? Add &#34;After The Goldrush&#34; while you're at it!<br /><br />This is the clear one that I'd give a higher rating if I could. Most of the '90s fans probably would've been &#34;Sleeping With Angels&#34; if it were not for the electricity of this essential Album. On this Album Neil Young clearly said &#34;This Note's For You&#34; to all Hard Rock fans! Clearly one of the best '90s (or any year in music) Albums of all time. The legend lives on!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Pirates 2 , I got this game when amazon had it as a freebie it was played on my velocity micro cruz 408 tablet and there where no problems with the game play at any time. When playing this game it's easy to lose track of time, If stuck at some point on a task there's a help button but it's hardly ever needed. I enjoyed part 1 of the game and this second part was just as good. Hopefully some how there could be a part 3. Pirates part 2  yea its that good .

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I definitely like this game just because there is no waiting for energy like all the other games out there. The game also has decent graphics and quests. So far I have only one complaint and that is I wish it was a bit easier to earn crowns on the game or that the extras didn't call for so many crowns. Overall it is a good game.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Best single book I've ever read. Hooks you on the world he created while still leaving so much unexplained for further books.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Pretty boring after the first third. Implausible Jamaican plot twist involving a private jet. Too elaborate. Obviously this is fiction but it goes so far into the realm of unbelievability as to make the entire book less enjoyable.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really fun sometimes hard but that's why we play right, nice graphics never the same puzzle it's different each time. If you run out of crystals though you have to waist to play.again if you don't have much to spend.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The 4th book is a little slower paced but still an exceptional novel with in-depth character development. As with every book in this series, I cannot wait to read the next one.
1449433251|5.0|This is the only gift my husband wanted for Christmas.  I know he will love it.  Thank you for getting the gift to me so quickly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is so amazing u can do so many different things with it , its my favorite app of all! if ur thinking about getting it dont think just get it its really extraordinary and a great time waster
B0031RS4UM|3.0|I found this noevl a little disappointing.  I thought the plot was a little over the top.  Perhaps if I lived in America or my life experience was different, if would have been more realistic but for me it was not.  It was certainly  exciting, as a thriller should be, but there were the reservaltions which have been mentioned.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it its so much fun for ages sure for the whole family I really like it and this is nice because it really wanted a horse and this is perfect
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best awesome Great book wish there was another one after mockingjay sadly there is not can wait for the movie!!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Very intuitive. I can set it even when I am dead tired. Features abound. The only clock I use anymore!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It is very fun and has good graphics and addictive better then it was then in the past keep going guy
B0014BY72Q|2.0|Pretty pathetic--it's not even campy enough to be fun.  Don't waste your time. This must have been horribly racy back when, but a few bare butts don't save this waste of celluloid.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not as exciting as I was expecting it to be.  It was so built up that I was let down after reading it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|She appeals to any religious or non-religious individual.  I'm very Catholic, but what I read gave me even more comfort.  I didn't think she was a bit self serving....if anything, we should ALL love ourselves ....our lives are a gift from our Creator and to think badly of ourselves is an insult to our Divine Lord.
B00FN811SY|5.0|HEY EVERYONE THE JW LIBRARY APP AS OF DEC 10 2013 WORKS ON MY KINDLE THIS MORNING WHEN I GOT UP. THANKS FOR LISTENING AMAZON.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I didn't rate this at 5 stars because its not working well as it i thought it would, streaming goes in and out, and audio most of the times does not go in time with who ever is talking, sometimes it get lost connection in the middle of a movie and the laptop is only about 3 feet away, this item needs improving. does not work with videos on your phone or pictures
B00BAXFECK|2.0|A truly poorly written novel, with a main character so awfully devoid of any personality or inherent interest, that his chapter long dialogues, which read as the masturbatory fantasies of a depressed fool, leave you gasping with boredom and utter confusion at why this book was ever written.  The ancillary characters are equally badly developed, and appear to exist as a means for the main character to again loose himself in self-ruminations and self-flagellation.  There is talent still in there - Donna Tartt can turn a phrase.  But this book serves as a reminder that a good editor is really the most important element missing from this awful piece of publishing.  I truly believe that every positive review in the press came from someone who truly never read the book.  That this took her ten years to write suggests it is long past time to hang up her career.  Sometimes obsessionally will ruin a good idea.  This is the best example of that in years.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Extremely well written book that improved my vocabulary in writting and even texting. The plot overall is horrible. great in the begining but it dies a sad and painful death until gasping for air in the very end. Very enligtening and cleverly written. Awful plot and story line.
0525478817|5.0|What can I say? Holt McDougal never fails to please! I read his autobiography, &#34;Searching for McDougal&#34; and knew that I had to take a look at this novel. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Though I am not a young adult, I can relate to many of the themes in this novel, probably because I am a human being. My favorite moment is when Holt's main character, Scarlet, tells her lover, &#34;No, James. The Hanklerfish was my first.&#34; Zing!<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Holt's previous work, you can find it on his online store here on Amazon. I must say, it's clear that he's been heavily influenced by John Green. Actually, I'd venture to say that Holt and John write like they're practically the same author. Probably why Holt put John's name on the cover of this book; clearly a shout-out. You're a humble one, McDougal!<br /><br />If I had to rate this book on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd rate it a 12, but Amazon forced me into a 5-star scale (with no allowance for extra stars). There should be a 6th star classified as a rating of &#34;Holt,&#34; and a seventh star defined as &#34;Awesome&#34;. Ironically, this beauty would fall into the &#34;Awesome&#34; category, surpassing Holt's own rating. I have no idea what I'm saying. Bravo, Holt! DFTBA.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Best mobile tools I've ever owned. Most of the time you end up having to buy tools one at a time instead of a kit. With this it's already put into a kit for you and they are of quality. Save yourself a lot of time and splurge a little to get something that will last.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|The singing is amazing!! Both the stars fighting for the Marilyn part deserve it.  The story is a bit soapoperish at times but all considered the show is quite entertaining
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book, could not put it down. It showed the good and the bad of Jobs while exploring the dichotomous nature of his personality that ultimately led him to become one of the great innovators of our time. Highly recommend it.
B00792EGES|5.0|Everything Perfect
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So, you don't have the budget to buy the lastest Smart TV? Then convert your good'ol LCD TV with Chromecast! Wireless video streaming. Your TV instantly turns into a Smart TV :D
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It was purchased by me, but my wife has taken over using it and loves it. I guess I will eventually have to purchase one for myself.<br />I have been able to download e-books on Kindle and access them on my I Pod Touch and Samsung Tablet. A great feature.
B000IDEORY|3.0|MY WIFE LOVES IT.  I CAN TOLERATE IT BECAUSE SHE LOVES IT.  IF I'M WRONG ABOUT THIS SHE WILL TELL ME WHEN SHE OPENS HER CHRISTMAS PRESENT.  ANOTHER MOVIE SHE LIKES IS GHANDI BUT I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO BUY IT YET.
B001QJUX24|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC WESTERN MESSAGE ABOUT DOING WHAT IS RIGHT EVEN IF YOUR HISTORY LEADS YOU TOWARD DOING WRONG.  THE SHIFT FROM WHAT YOU LEARN AS A CHILD TO WHAT YOU DO AS AN ADULT IS CLEARLY PORTRAYED FROM START TO FINISH.
B0045O2PGO|5.0|This is an awesome movie that everyone should see.  The lead actors all give outstanding performances.  I can see why Courtney Love was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this movie, and I think Woody Harrelson should have been nominated as well.  The movie does a great job of following Flynt's struggles with the law, and his fight for freedom of speech and freedom of the press under the First Amendment, and does so in an entertaining way.  Funny and tragic at the same time.  A must see.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I've been playing Freecell for years, mostly on the PC but more recently via apps. I picked this one up the other day as a FAOTD, which has rekindled my addiction to the game . It's very well done, works smooth on my Kindle. I like that you can change backgrounds, even being able to use one of your own pictures if desired.<br />The only improvement the developer could make, would be to add in the game numbers, so you could pick the games you play, it makes it fun if you can challenge a game partner trying to win the same game.<br />Overall, an excellent app, well worth the .99 cent cost, even better as a FAOTD...thanks Amazon...
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Ordered And am pleased with quality of service that I received.  Thanks Amazon for being so prompt in providing downloading to my device.
B007SGM084|1.0|I usually do not change a review after I have written one, however,  I changed my review and I would rate it even less if there was a rating less than one star.  I purchased these books after hearing so much hype about fifty shades of grey and so many individuals in the media and online being crazy about these books.  I am about half way through with the first book and I am absolutely sick of the whining, insecure, and constant thoughts of sex and talking about sex.  All the books talk about is blushing, sex, and both being insecure with the other.  This is a very poorly written book that is not worth the money to purchase.  I regret spending money on these prolly written books.<br /><br />I have read many books and as an educated person I find these books poorly written with little  meaning.  I found myself bored and quickly got tired of the repetition  in the books.  don't waste your time or money on these books.  They are a complete waste of time.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Ordered And am pleased with quality of service that I received.  Thanks Amazon for being so prompt in providing downloading to my device.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|I watched the Swedish versions of these films and wanted to see how the American version compared.<br />Very nicely done.  Daniel Craig was good casting.  I hope they continue with the other two of the series??
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the kind of puzzle game that I simply can't pass up. The soft music is perfectly soothing in comparison to some of the levels, which can get a little frustrating if you're going for a perfect score. All in all, it's hard not to say that the game is well worth it. It's definitely one of the better ones for my Kindle Fire HD.
B003K15IF8|1.0|By the time I got half way into the introductory comments I knew the whole story.  So I quit reading it. Then when I started to read the actual book, I found the character development to lack depth and to be, well, boring.  I wasn't interested in knowing these dull people, and felt that I would not get to know them even if I continued to read.  So I didn't.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun game that keeps you entertained for hours. I haven't had any problems or issues and it is not necessary to spend money to continue.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the way the stories twist and intertwine at the end.  Heartbreaking sometimes but I highly recommend this book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed this story very much.  It provided an interesting perspective from each character and causes you to think of what you would do in this situation.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|It was a great prequel to the maze runner series. Different characters and earlier but just as good. Five stars
B008QE9XD2|5.0|What a hoot! I like Johnny D and many of his movies. Who thinks of the screenplay...who writes this stuff? Buy it, someone in the house will watch it periodically. We do.
B00E0SX118|5.0|This is great for the who family!  I'm 43 and I think I enjoyed it as much as my 5 year old!
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Wow!  This movie was funny!  The minions really brought this one through, the entire cast did a great job on bringing this one to life!!!
0345803485|1.0|Oops what a lousy book this is!<br />The plot was shallow.<br />The characters so needy, it was hard to finish the book.<br />I have no idea why this book was recommended by anyone.<br />Rubbish.
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|A decent read but knew where the story was going early on. Better than the last Grisham novel but still far from his best.
159420411X|5.0|Amazing book, I have had to completely rethink my error analysis and estimation! The discussion on Bayesian analysis really opened my eyes to some errors I've been making in scientific measurement.
B00GQ7OZR0|5.0|There was only so many ways it could end and I think they choose a very poetic way to go. I really enjoyed the final season.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|It is a very well made movie in general with a great cast and special effects. I gave it only 1 star because its just another &#34;Superman Returns&#34; bust. It is written by some snot nose kid who wasnt even born when both George and Christopher Reeves played the role which is obvious from all the made up facts and changes made in this movie. I have advice for all snot nosed kid writers who are considering remaking any good movie..... dont because you $uck at it!!!
B000V8A95C|5.0|My wife and I saw Wicked at the Wharton Center in Lansing, MI in 2012 and we absolutely loved it!!!  Being a musical, there were numerous songs that were really great, ranging from funny to powerful.  Just a great musical with great music.
B006QNDDHW|5.0|Very well written!  Very attractive and instructive. She practices what she preaches!  A must for every presenter and every graphic designer's library.
0061438294|5.0|Well written with very little &#34;jargon&#34;; if you are looking for a &#34;handbook&#34; about non-verbal communication this book is for you. I learned a lot, not only about other people but about myself too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Again he spins a tale that crosses time and borders to paint pictures in our minds of distant times and places long gone. His imagery with words are pure art. His characters come alive. Always a pleasure to read his work.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Already own a Roku and can't help comparing Chromecast to the device I already have. I do not use any android or I-devices so controlling this device is using a chrome browser.<br /><br />Roku vs. Chromecast is night and day. 100s of channel vs. a handful? Idea is to avoid another remote but often a remote comes handy. FF, rewind, pause, etc. a remote is a better tool than re-launch  chrome, may be wait a second or two for allowing me to launch the menu a perform my action: not exciting.<br /><br />Roku + Plex far better than this product.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Loved this one. very good all songs are excellent. now to make sure i typed enough words so i don't just dump this site!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|WHile I loved the book while I was reading it, it seemed to be a bit of his familiar formula.<br />I even guessed the ending by the 4th page.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|The book is inspiring and incredibly interesting from a historical perspective.  However, the writing was altogether too polished and research too thorough to be her work alone.  I am glad I read it because it was very informative and of course she is an inspiration to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was adventure-packed and was a thrilling close to the Hunger Games series. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B005DKLPF6|4.0|I've been a fan of mastodon since remission. They seem to grow and grow with each album release, and this album is no exception. With a much more straight-forward approach, but it still sounds like mastodon to me. Its a great album. I really enjoy the spacier songs on this album. Its a must-have for any mastodon fan. Although it ranks 4th on my list of their entire discography. But that isn't a bad thing, they have just released amazing stuff. My favorite album they have done is still Leviathan.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|I didn't finish the book.  I found it tedious and hard to follow.  But in fairness, I thought this was going to be a contemporary thriller.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Fantastic movie. Love the ease of Amazon Instant Video and having it on all of my handheld devices. Highly recommend the movie and the service.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book will leave you up all night wanting more it was a great finish to an excellent series. I highly recommend this book. Some people may not have liked it but I personally believe that it shows great examples of how people should treat each other. You should defiantly get this book!:)
B00BGD8CFK|3.0|The Spigen SGP Slim Armor Color Case for iphone 5s.  I like the case other than it scratches very easy.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I love playing the game but it keeps messing up when its updating. I was playing no problem then came back to play some more and it tells me it needs to update. Try to play and glurb shows 5 blank spots and tell me that I have 99 hrs to complete. One of mine unicorns is on a pink spot and I can't feed him. But I love to talk to people from all over the world. Thanks hope this helps you.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is one of the best game I have played. Only thing with this is they need to put the online up there
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Dumb Ways to Die is a very addicting game; a game where you have to complete these taks, so your adorable friend doesnt die. It's very addicting. My only problem is , i keep unlocking new characters, but never use them in the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The plot is so well written.  The characters are developed in such a fashion that you are drawn into their lives and situations.  Thought provoking, coaxes a gentle flow of emotion from the reader. Literally took my breath away.  Time well spent reading this gem.
B00A7L00XE|1.0|I don't get it - this CD is just plain bad - no other way to put it.  I am a big Blues fan and I feel emabarassed for Charlie Musselwhite.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There wasn't much I didn't love about this book - the narrator, the story, the little girl, her neighbors and her grasp of a situation.  As a reader, one can't escape the wonderfulness of all that needed to be done to enjoy the written word, nor shake off how much there was to be passed on.  But as moving as the story was, it was the lack of sentimentality that gave it its beauty.  Things were what they were with Nazi dominance, and each character wore their own shell of visibility to make their world fit into an imagined normalcy.  The little girl honed her instincts by being the observer - the reader of these various persona's.  For her, the richness of her existence was found in choices made, in tune to the times.  I hope the movie doesn't rob this story of its subtle depiction of survival, and what it means to stay alive.
0739384171|5.0|This is another great book in a great series. As an audio book, it makes driving something to look forward to doing. ROAD TRIP!
B00G9U7R2O|1.0|The movie was fine. It was really hard to watch because the stream kept stopping, then taking forever to load again, then play for a minute, then start, and stop...
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Heat or We Are 40.  The cast was perfect - I will watch it again!
1465414444|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful book and it is so helpful in the game play.  WOW is a fascinating game and when you add in this book along with the novel, you have a complete experience.
B004TN7QPG|3.0|Google play store has newer version. This app on Amozon is versions behind whats on Google play store. Great for epub reader. But not for PDF. Use free PDF readers like adobe or foxit for much better PDF functions. I hate ads so buying it was worth it to remove ads. The added support of PDF is not worth buying it if that's the only reason you want to buy it.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I never thought I would ever like a Miley Cyrus album, but this one is it.  I was never a Miley fan, but I had heard of her and heard a song here and there on the radio.  I was not impressed much to buy anything of hers.  I always thought of her as some teeny-bopper disney pop princess type.  Not anymore.  Every track on this CD is fun including the bonus tracks on the deluxe edition.  Her voice is really quite good.  She's got some strong pipes developing.  It'll be interesting to see what other music she evolves into later in her career.  Despite the controversy surrounding her performance at the music awards, which I was indifferent to, focusing on the music she doesn't need to do any of those antics.  The music on this album is attention enough.  Did you notice the album cover looks like a Pat Benatar record from the Eighties?  Great album.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Good movie.... was a little predictable but really good. Watched it with my family wasn't too bloody for everyone. Really enjoyed it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is great 7-13 it's very funny I read book 1 2 3 4 5 7 and 8 can't wait for book 9
B008Y212PI|5.0|Who cares if things are a mess I'm having too much fun!  I may have to quit cooking too. Everyone for himself.  Have fun. Forget everything else this is too much fun.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this dragonvale game is spectacular and its fun. its kind of hard to not come back to this app everyday, if y'all know what I'm saying lol
B00BEIYN3M|4.0|Much of this movie is very funny, especially in the first 20 minutes as the cast and premise are introduced. The end of the movie is more predictable but overall still an enjoyable film (provided you aren't offended by drug dealing or strippers, of course).
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is the best. Not many people like Real Steel but once you get this game you will love Real Steel. I got so into this I'm a huge fan of Real Steel I have Toys of Real Steel Everything of Real Steel so get this game.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Quality of audio, packaging, and availability of previously unreleased outtakes, etc all exceeded my expectations! If you're a fan of Harry this is a must have.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Saw the 2nd movie, but couldn't just stop at that.  I had to know what happens next!  This book exceeded my expectations and for the moment has held off my impatience to see the final film.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I'm loving the book!  I actually bought it as a Kindle then upgraded to audio and I really appreciate hearing the story as well as reading it.  It's a beautifully written book.  The characters are real and believable making the story that much more amazing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have always been a die hard fan of the hunger games trilogy, which was heightened even more by the arrival of the movies, but now that I've read Mockingjay for the eighth time: WHAT DO I DO WITH MY LIFE?
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|The perspective of the main character made this movie interesting and unique.  Enjoyed almost every aspect of this film.  Thank you.
B009LDD22U|5.0|I bought this item for myself on Black Friday and I am very satisfied with the contents in the package that I recieved yesterday afternoon.<br /><br />If you like this season or the show overall, this is the perfect gift to own!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Just like the actual weather channel, the app is full of all kinds of garbage and non-weather stuff that makes it hard to read and cumbersome to use.<br /><br />The bare bones version of the app from a year or two ago was much better.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Obviously Jaycee is not a seasoned author and the narrative wanders quite a bit, but her courageous true story is intriguing and heart-wrenching.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple. Cheap. Easy. Especially if you only use netflix and youtube. Works well with my IPad and IPhone. Great for TVs in bedrooms that you don't want to upgrade to SMART TVs or Apple TV.
B000FA675C|5.0|This one is another page-turner, very exciting and informative at the same time.  I really learned a lot while being thoroughly entertained.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|We have all heard of the famous duel between David, a weak lowly shepherd & Goliath the much stronger human specimen. We have heard of how David actually ends up beating Goliath in a single blow.  But then we had not quite analyzed it to understand why did that happen? Was it just a freak co-incidence or is there a logical explanation to what happened between David & Goliath. If there is an explanation, can that result be re-created? These are some of the questions that Malcolm Gladwell’s “David & Goliath” answers.<br /><br />Just like his previous books, he has done a great amount of research himself & referenced to a lot of research work done by others to put across his points through various real-life examples. One of the examples that struck me the most was how the Londoners stuck together during the second world war when they were being constantly attacked by the Germans. Through various examples Malcolm has demonstrated how a David can actually win over a Goliath. Just because you are strong does not guarantee you success. One’s weakness when analyzed & used wisely can actually prove to be their strength.<br /><br />It’s a wonderfully written non-fiction book. It has a continuous flow to it which makes you not want to put it down.<br /><br />Towards the end there is a paragraph that summarizes the book very well & it should convince any reader to pick up this book & start reading. It goes like this:<br /><br />“It was not the privileged & the fortunate who took in the Jews in France. It was the marginal & the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what evil & misfortune can accomplish. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death & destruction but you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering & despair. But one time in ten, out of that despair rises an indomitable force. You see the giant & the shepherdin the valley of Elah & your eye is drawn to the man with sword & shield & the glittering armor. But so much of what is beautiful & valuable in the world comes from the shepherd, who has more strength & purpose then we ever imagine”
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Amazingly intoxicating.  Keeps you on the edge of you seat the entire season. Best to watch on DVD so you can run marathons of episodes.
B003MXD694|5.0|Great rendering of a great story. Voices and characterizations are solid, humane and cheerful, oh and just a little on the quirky side<br /><br />( after all it is Wes Anderson doing Roald Dahl. )
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I was assigned this book in my Literature class, and we are going to put on a play for the kindergarteners. So my mom let me have her Kindle so that I could read it. I enjoyed the last chapter best! He  is so much happier!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is easy to use. Like the big buttons. It has all the features I need. Uncomplicated. No complaints.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|OK, so also using a Roku, this is superior in a few way. I Travel for work, so much of my &#34;usual TV&#34; is off the net. While Roku and Chromecast both play content off the Net, for the Roku unit you do have to play some games when signing into a Hotel internet. The Chromecast plays directly from my Laptop or Smartphone. This means that if my internet device can log in, Chromecast can play it. Setup is very good, but I have not tried to hack the security on it. Video & Sound are great.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I liked it<br />It is exciting and addicting writing. I am always looking for more time to read and read more.  Great book
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another book I sunk my literary teeth into and enjoyed thoroughly.  Gaiman has a way of haunting your thoughts when you have started one of his books and staying there until you've finished it...whether that's a couple of hours or a couple of days after the first words are read.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We love the piano guys and we were thrilled to find out that they were releasing a Christmas album. We cannot wait to see them in concert in Seattle. They are such a great inspiration to my daughter who plays the cello and helps both my children to love and appreciate great music. The music featured on this album has helped us get into the Christmas spirit and we are enjoying sharing the album with family and friends.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Great series.  Only caught one episode during the regular season and was impressed enough to want to see the whole story.  Now looking forward to season 2.  I came to understand why the Europeans were so terrified when the Vikings came to raid.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas CDs yet! The Piano Guys don't disappoint with their version of Christmas carols. Definitely a must have for holidays!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|No one does it better than The Piano Guys. They are very unique and this is a &#34;must have&#34; CD.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very easy to use but when i stream HBO-Go the voice/picture aren't in sync. Sometimes that happens with Netflix streaming but clears up after a short while. I love being able to stream onto the TV instead of just my small laptop!
0316204366|5.0|I got this for my husband, who must really like it because he spends a lot of time reading it in the bathroom.

B00EVCD9HY|4.0|Outstanding music. Really, Really,  Really fun for house style dancing. Would be 5 stars but the lyrics are geared for a young girl.  Can't wait for a mash up of Dance Apocalyptic.  Undoubtedly upcoming work will smash all records.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great reading could not put it down.  John Grisham does it again with a winning best Seller.  I loved a time to kill and this brought back all those memories of another great book.<br />.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|Another great album from Dave and Co. and yet also not quite the same as the previous ones which I think is a great direction for any band or musician to take as they continue to write and release music. Also rocked many of these tunes at the Newark NJ show a while back. The 320 Kb mp3 downloads are a great touch but I still prefer the vinyl when listening at home. Well mastered and pressed. No complaints at all.
B005OP7162|5.0|I did not start watching this when it came on TV.  Several friends kept telling me I was missing a great show.  Before Season 2 I ordered the premier and from then on it was one after another until Season 2 started I am a TRUE Revenge fan/
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the first time I have ever even rated a game because it is the only one I wish there were 1000's more of!  It takes a genius to make a good logic puzzle game and I tip my hat to whoever was clever enough to write this one.  HARD but never so illogical that I had to cheat or get a walkthrough.  It is also the most beautiful, cleverest and aesthetically eerie - even frightening at times!<br /> TO THE AUTHOR(s?)  Thank you for letting it go on &quot;sale&quot; that one day, best few hours I've ever spent on my Kindle!  I'd be honored to be your guinea pig any time!  Good luck and Godspeed!  -kelly
B000E8N690|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie, thought both leads were somewhat believable. If you like Johnny Cash then do not miss it.

B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|classically reproduces pieces of the Simirillian into story providing some backround story and depth. not recommended for diehard fans who expect exact reproductions of the book, or small children.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game was a an absolutely wonderful book, I only wish I had gotten around to reading it before now!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  It was well written, an interesting cast of characters and mostly I liked the social commentary.  The age old \\" good triumphing over evil\\" ideology was apparent.  Social injustice was horrible during that time in history and I'm glad it was recognized in this book.  A good read with a message.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|challenging and fun. I like the way the different levels challenge me in different ways. some are timed and others limit the number of moves you can make.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was a great movie.  Not for young children, but a good interpretation of the book.  It doesn't stay exactly with the book, but what movie does, or can in 2 hours.
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year olds have no problem moving and inserting pieces. They enjoy it very much as soon as I can get to wherever you buy the extra puzzles will dop so. Thanks for a great app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read the full series. I never thought I would read the books because of the subject matter. But after I started reading the first book I could not put them down. I finished all three books in one week.<br /><br />The author knows how to present this sensitive subject in a way that is palatable; enjoyable even. By the end of the first book I had fallen in love with Christian! Fifty Shades of Love - actually.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Funny. Witty. Unexpected.  Great story.  It all adds up to a movie that everyone can enjoy.  It can be seen over and over and still seems refreshing.

B00EVW013E|2.0|SAME OLD SAME OLD AND TOO FEW EMORABLE SCEANS. THE &#34;SPECIAL EFECTS&#34; DONE WITH MORE TALENT AND IMAGINATION COULD HAVE MADE THIS A FIVE STAR MOVIE...
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|You must have a very strong stomach to watch this Criterion Collection stand-out. Again, based on fact, this is exceptionally hard to stomach, and many times I kept saying to myself &#34;I know there's no special effects or CGI&#34; and it just got sicker and sicker and sicker. I don't know if I should wear a badge for having seen this, and kept it, but it's a rough movie and I don't know what emotions it will stir in your soul, but I found myself wondering if I even had a soul after the movie ended.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|GREAT STORY TO SAY THE LEAST! MEMORABLE SO I WON'T HAVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN. LEONARDO DICAPRIO DID WELL WITH THIS ONE...
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Finally! A breath of fresh air. The best part of this is the DVD/CD packaging. The CD for the car, and the DVD for when you want to laugh your *ss off at how bawdy Adele can really be. And it just adds to her charm. What a great gift for someone who doesn't know ADELE at all. Perfect. In every way.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Best book about world war two I have read in along time. It  is hard to put down once you start reading.
B006QKJZMW|5.0|Wait until my version of HOSTEL IV comes out. Then you will see what a ground-breaking torture porn movie should be about. This is a great film and would have done well at the box office, and I couldn't stop watching it when I got it. But then I came up with my idea and said &#34;F-yeah!&#34; There's something filmmakers in this genre are grossly overlooking, and it's…my version. HOSTEL IV.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I've had the Chromecast for about two months now. I really wanted to love it. But unfortunately I'm not very happy with my purchase and will try to return it if I still can.<br /><br />Set up was easy. Youtube streaming works like a charm from all my IOS and Android devices. But I could not get Netflix to work. I'm a big user of Netflix and this is a deal breaker for me. I contacted Google tech support via email and they are absolute MORONS!! They don't listen to what I'm saying and repeatedly ask the same questions. Every time I respond to their email, a different person picks it up and asks the same questions. It was very frustrating and if it weren't for their horrible support I probably would have given it 3 stars. I'd shell out a few extra bucks and get a Roku with WIFI.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really like how the show has brought the various characters together. Never a dull moment... It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We love the Piano Guys. Their music is fantastic and their Christmas Album doesn't disappoint. I have 3 young boys who love this album and listen to it daily.
B00CM7FLZ8|4.0|This game is really funny. Hambo's costumes make it way funnier than Angry Birds, the gameplay is quite similar though. The tutorial mission is quite long (40 missions) and a little boring. Good variety of weapons from guns to uzi to bow and arrows!
1594203334|5.0|This book is hysterical.  I gurgled, chuckled and laughed all the way through it.  I purchased it for a friend then read it all myself and wanted to keep it.  I've spent some time in France and the author is spot on.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I loved this game so much! It's incredibly funny to play, the idea rocks! You'll gonna hate it soon, though, because it becomes harder to reach scores high enough to unlock all the characters. BTW, the music video you unlock after a few practice is well worth the pain! I bet you'll sing all day long &#34;Duuuumb ways to dieeee so many dumb ways to dieeeee&#34;!
1476733953|5.0|This was a great book.  Good characterization, well balanced, not formulaic or predictable.  I love SF and this satisfied me on every level.  I'm now looking for more books by this author.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|A fun way to waste probably too much time.  Contrary to another review, it works fine on my Fire HD.
1416549447|1.0|Didn't work on me. Of course, all bodies are different, but the approach to &#34;effortless, injury free running&#34; was a bust on my body. The knees continued to hurt afterwards, and the back hurt even more than before  Walking only from now on.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I had been looking for a good book to read and stumbled upon \\"Gone Girl\\" which took my breath away with some wonderful twists. Now, I am reading all of Gillian Flynn's books. Keep writing, girl. I loved this one, too.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|This one just was missing some of the Bryson wit I had come to appreciate.  Interesting read, but not his best from my perspective.  Walk in the Woods and Thunderbolt Kid made me laugh (or at least smile frequently), while One Summer just kept me informed with an occasional appreciation for his subtle wit.  However, I'll still buy the next Bryson book!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The words just flow and the pages just fly by. This was one of his books that I never wanted to end.

1451666179|5.0|I love the book, hilarious. I bought a second at a book store to give as a gift. I would have liked to see all new stories, as I've read a few of these on the blog, but still worth it. Just mad at Amazon for sending me a damaged first copy then forcing me to make an unnecessary trip to UPS! I will not purchase another book thru Amazon as they are not shrink wrapped, they just throw them in an envelope and send it.

B005IF7HNA|2.0|Series gets five stars, but this set only gets two. I took a chance after hearing some people couldn't get Miracle Day to play, and I had the same problem. It's a shame, since most Torchwood sets are missing it, and I can't stream it from Amazon, Netflix or Hulu.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon is a superb book on an exceptional man and an exceptional business.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were EXTREMELY well written and detailed!! I enjoyed them greatly and will read it again i would not however recommend them for a child under 12-13 as they are fairly graphic....
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Excellent reporting on a very complex subject. A must read for everyone who has an interest in improving their health. Maybe a bit too scientific for some folks. I really liked the book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very easy to navigate and use.  The app has icons that link to references, such as Old testament quotes found in the New Testament.

B000QI2ZWW|1.0|I rented this movie from Amazon. It never played...even after trying through several browsers, different computers, and downloading the latest version of Silverlight.<br /><br />The last time this happened the movie eventually played. But not this time.
0316219266|4.0|I used to struggle mightily to choose a star rating for a book like “The Everything Store” which I personally enjoyed reading but, objectively, suffers from significant flaws. Ultimately, I decided to rely on Amazon’s explicit instruction to use ratings as a subjective analysis: four stars translates to “I like it.” And I did like reading this fast-paced, surprisingly engaging treatment of what could be - for a non-techy reader with no particular interest in biography, corporate or otherwise - a thoroughly dry topic. That said, after finishing Matt Stone’s book I recommend every reader turn to the reviews of insiders MacKenzie Bezos (one-star), Andy Jassy (one-star), “Rick” (Dalzell, three-star), Jonathan Leblang (four-star), and “S. Kaphan” (four-star) to get a more balanced view of the company.<br /><br />As a writer, I would find the type of factual errors exposed in these reviews thoroughly embarrassing (while only a handful seem to be of significant import, the sheer number of mistakes listed by both fans and foes of the book astounds). Moreover, what many of these folks and a large number of friends of mine who have observed Bezos in meetings (one doesn’t live in downtown Seattle long without meeting a slew of Amazon employees and gaining some insight into the company’s functioning) say is that Stone portrayed the man’s intensity but not the incredible intelligence that attends it.<br /><br />Stone paid only lip service to what is arguably Bezos’s best asset: not just his “boundless intellect,” but his “‘unbelievable ability to be incredibly intelligent about things he had nothing to do with.’” Apparently the guy can walk into any meeting in any of his buildings, read the six-page summary document thing, and immediately not only identify the points of weakness other extremely capable folks have been struggling with for weeks or months, but also ask incredibly detailed questions that demonstrate deep understanding and touch upon consequential issues that no one else has yet considered. Stone gives Bezos credit for vision and boldness, but his tone paints Bezos more like a lucky gambler than the hard-working and super smart leader that he is. (As for personal warmth, amongst Amazon employees Bezos’s laugh is discussed as a widely adored and genuine side effect of a quirky sense of humor, not a feared weapon craftily deployed as Stone suggests.)<br /><br />Stone glosses over a handful of sound criticisms - like the fact that Amazon systematically under-staffs projects (in the Seattle mommy community the company is widely referred to as “the sweatshop”), can make poor decisions as a result of overvaluing assertiveness and decisiveness (I, for one, think it can at times be best to stand at a crossroads and assess a problem for a bit rather than simply choosing a fork, rolling over objections, and plowing full steam ahead every time), and “has the bureaucracy of a big company with the infrastructure and pace of a startup, with lots of duplicate efforts and poor communication that [can make] it difficult to get things done” - and instead attempts to paint Bezos and the company as bullies.<br /><br />Take the Kaphan story, for example. Stone chooses adjectives and frames the tale in such a way as to indict Bezos as a disloyal meany. But what exactly is he supposed to have done wrong there? Bezos apparently believed the company had outgrown his number two’s capabilities. He didn’t fire the guy and even went out of his way to celebrate Kaphan’s contributions. Was he supposed to breach his fiduciary duty to Amazon and ignore the company’s commitment to maximize the customer experience by not only telling his friend he could stay as long as he liked but also giving him management responsibilities he couldn’t handle?<br /><br />Most irritatingly, Stone models the behavior (fictional or not) that he criticizes in the Fiona and Quidsi episodes, allowing his own emotion and ambition to drive decision-making at the expense of common decency. He dehumanizes and demeans some of our country’s most accomplished businessmen (well, business people) - referring to upper management as “Jeff Bots” that Amazon hasn’t “allowed to speak in public” - simply because they stayed on-message and didn’t dish the dirt he sought in interviews. More significantly, Stone apparently tracked down and contacted Bezos’s birth father and then went ahead and informed the man of the adoptee’s identity all without Bezos’s consent. That move may not be illegal or even unambiguously unethical, but it certainly ain’t classy.<br /><br />I doubt Stone’s editorializing and hurtful hypocrisy is the stuff of an objective one-star rating. But that’s not what individual ratings on Amazon are about. MacKenzie Bezos rightly chose the star equivalent of “I hate it” since the book focuses on her husband’s rough edges (at least some of which are arguably essential to keep the folks he manages and ship he steers on course) and fails to fully explore his many awe-inspiring traits.<br /><br />I haven’t been in touch with anyone at Amazon about this review (in other words, I’m not drinking the Kool-Aid). I just sorted through all the info I’ve got - the book, reviews, and personal anecdotes - to call it like it is for me: good book, enjoyable read, though not entirely fair in fact or spirit.ition to drive decision-making at the expense of common decency.

6305882592|5.0|My favorite movie.  IT also has a great soundtrack.  The look may be a bit dated.  There is wisdom in the lines the characters say.  It is a dark comedy, FYI.

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It has  some problems with  kicking you out &amp; not starting up. It takes too long to obtain items you need. The storage  space is too small &amp; takes too long to find items needed to enlarge it. It's a fun if they would correct those problem areas.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|HBO hit a home run with this, the first of the series of the George RR Martin highly acclaimed 5 book series. Filming is amazing, characters come to life, and the Games begin. I have read all the books and look forward to this series taking me through all 5 books. Book 6 should be out this year. Great job HBO!!
1451666179|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. Allie Brosh's drawings and existential humor can brighten anyone's day.<br /><br />The new content is awesome, I especially loved her tips for dogs.<br /><br />Will be buying copies for friends this Christmas.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This movie is really very current with what can happen when young girls and boys are taken for human trafficking. It is well acted and very interesting. The story very compelling.  It really lets you know that parents have to be vigilant in watching out for their children. I was shocked to know that over 800,000 kids and young adults go missing world wide every year in the human trafficing trade.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Beautiful music.  Fast shipping.  Listening to these ladies is what I think heaven will sound like.  Cherish the moments.  Wow
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this series. It is the most complex, exciting and beautifully shot series on television. George RR Martin's books are fantastic reading in their detail and his descriptive writing. It literally takes you  to these places and puts you into the stories. You get invested in the characters and what happens to them. HBO has brought the books to life on screen in a way that makes everything about the books come to life.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|This is an excellent bag for an entry-level or mid-range DSLR camera with a single lens, and should also accommodate an attached battery grip.  It is best suited for use with a &#34;super-zoom&#34; or all-in-one lower-level lens, like an 18-135, 28-135, 24-85, 15-85, that sort of thing.  It might handle a 28-200, or a higher end lens like a 17-55, 17-40, or 24-105, but I don't know for sure.  It will NOT handle a second lens, so if you are starting out with a two-lens kit (like 18-55 and 55-250), this is not the bag for you.  The pockets on the outside are slim.  I fit a 58mm filter in its round plastic case in one, and a spare tripod plate and allen key in the other.  The front pocket is also slim, and has two little soft-lined pouches that would fit SD cards.  There is no room for a separate flash, not even a little one.<br /><br />I see two great uses for this bag.  (1) new DSLR owners who bought a lower-level camera and a superzoom, like a Rebel or 70D with with an 18-135, or (2) photo buffs looking for a cheap knockaround bag for an older film camera.  I fall into the second category.  I bought this for a Canon EOS Elan 7N, with battery grip, plus a 28-105 lens.  The front pocket is a little slim for extra rolls of film, but you can probably get two rolls in there, plus some extra batteries.  I got a pair of CR123A batteries into one of the SD card pouches.  Because my lens for this camera is relatively compact, I also wedged a 40mm pancake lens inside the main compartment in a thin pouch, but that is a really tight fight.  The pancake will not fit in the side pocket unless you remove the rear cap (or somebody starts selling a pancake rear cap HINT HINT).  I also tested this camera with my 100mm USM macro (not the L version) and it fit, but it was not tall enough for my 70-300mm.<br /><br />The Elan 7N plus battery grip fills up the space at the top.  Anything wider would be tight, but might be doable without a battery grip.  The specs on my camera are 5.78 inches or 146.7 mm wide, and probably about the same height with the battery grip.<br /><br />My biggest complaint?  There is no belt loop on the back.  Your carrying options are the shoulder strap or the hand strap (which is mostly just for picking up and setting down).  A belt loop would have made this a nice addition to a waist or shoulder pack for other lenses.
006202406X|5.0|My granddaughter got me interested bin this series. I find it to be very interesting and well written. She is waiting for me to finish so she can have the book!
147676459X|5.0|Allie did NOT disappoint with her first book! There were so much more new material than I expected and I loved seeing some old favorites. This would make a great gift for anyone with a quirky sense of humor.<br /><br />One thing to note - I bought the hard cover thinking it would be a nice coffee table book, however it is the size of a standard novel so I was a bit mistaken. No complaints though!
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Sorry, this was so far the Grisham's poorest effort, and I have ever been his die-hard fan. Dull, boring, dragging for eternity, with a helluva legal and trial hotchpotch and tens of messy characters who grew in numbers with each new page turning... An absolute and inconsistent mess. At times I felt like I am reading one of his peculiar legal cases, or that he was just presenting some lay Mississippi court trial handbook. No action, no thrill, no suspense... I would have stopped reading after the first hundred pages, but I was still waiting and holding high hopes for the plot to FINALLY unravel. Only the book ended before that happened. Such a waste of time.... John, you should seriously consider returning to your legal practice and forget about writing any new books.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I actually really love this app but I had to give it three stars because for some unknown reason it is not letting me buy the books from the kindle store. Every time I type in an authors name or a title it takes me straight to amazon.com and for some reason it won't let me buy directly from there so I have to get off and get on the internet, go back to amazon.com, type in the book and then I can finally buy it. I can't even look at a free sample without having to go online to the website. It doesn't make much since seeing how I have no trouble buying books straight from the tablet when the books are in the recommend or select 25 sections. It is really frustrating me. If it weren't for this one HUGE problem then I would have given it a 5 star. If someone could fix this I would REALLY appreciate it!

B00138CV5K|5.0|Smoky vocals with catcy tunes that only Ray can provide. Check out his other albums. Really like his Pariah Dogs album
B00BXLU1EU|4.0|Worked great the first time I tried it! Hopefully it will continue to do the job? I will keep using it and recommending it, so far.
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Love the cd and ellie goulding!!!!! I bought this cd just for 10 extra songs but I bought halcyon the first released one too!
B000RJO578|5.0|I love this movie and I got it after my friend introduced it to me.  It is funny and out there but hilarious!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was evaluating this product for use with tweens. The ambient music is eerie, and when the whispers are added, it does test the 'line.'  But, overall, the game manages to stay kid-suitable.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love this movie and I got it after my friend introduced it to me.  It is funny and out there but hilarious!
B00BC254I8|5.0|Saw the documentary of the book and wanted to see into his world in detail couldn't put the book down was a great read........
B006GH6IS4|5.0|The most interesting part was the description of Freddy Mercury's final days.  He worked until the end of his AIDS-shortened life.
0061122416|5.0|I've read this book at least a dozen times.<br />It never gets old.<br />Whenever I need inspiration, I just pick it up and it saves my day.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|How can you go wrong at this price (especially if you get 3 months of Netflix free).  Integration with phone apps is great.  It's as if the YouTube and Netflix iPhone apps were designed with Chromecast in mind.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Two reasons: I visited Karachi regularly in the 1960's and saw what the place was like and how the people lived. This book was an elightenment to me as to how the country had changed in the intervening years.<br />The book revealed to me that the normal inhabitants and business people of the various territories did not agree with or welcome the Taliban.<br />The average family was forced to go elsewhere for the sake of personal and family safety. The businesses and schools faced similar problems.<br />This is a situation not faced by the western world, and most of us do not appreciate these problems and cannot do so unless a book such as this one is read and understood.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very informative and it provides an interesting perspective.  I have always focused on Jesus' moral teachings, so this historical perspective does not alter my faith.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this book. 30 some years ago, I could have been this kid. It was fun and fast paced action.
0062082841|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't been said. This is a terrific book about a master filmmaker,fellow fantasy film fan and avid collector of the fantastic. My one regret is I couldn't afford the limited edition it is very, very cool. A must for fans of maestro Del Toro.
B008JFUORW|2.0|There may be spoilers ahead.<br /><br />The concluding chapter of what started out to be a hilarious off-beat series, turns out to be a mean spirited, unfunny heist film.  The movie opens with Alan (Zach Galifianakis) cruising down the freeway with a giraffe being hauled in a trailer behind him.  Yeah, watch out for those low overpasses.  Next, Alan's dad (Jeffrey Tambor) drops dead after an argument with his son.  Then there are the hijinks at Dad's funeral.  Still not laughing?<br /><br />Enroute to Arizona to get Alan some \\"help,\\" the Wolfpack are hijacked and kidnapped by mobster Marshall (John Goodman).  He holds Doug (Justin Bartha) hostage until Alan, Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) can find the elusive Chow (Ken Jeong) and retrieve $21 million in gold bullion Chow stole from Marshall.  From that point on it is a series of double crosses that most will see coming.  It leads the guys to Mexico and eventually back to Las Vegas where they have a weird but brief reunion with former hooker Jade (Heather Graham) and a surprise meeting with pawn shop operator Cassie played by Melissa McCarthy.<br /><br />When I saw McCarthy, I thought now this is going to get good.  She and Alan make goo-goo eyes but nothing really happens.  Truly a lost opportunity.  The whole film is lost on me.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't thrilling, just a bore.  In addition to the giraffe, dogs & chickens also die, so if you are an animal love stay away.  Even if you're not, stay away.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Easy in and out of the app. Great story. Great planning. Beautiful graphics. Fun games. Did I leave anything out? Well, sometimes the next move isn't obvious and the map can get confusing, but those are minor compared to the experience. And you can actually conclude (and win!) this game which is a nice twist over most phone apps.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I absolutely love this game and yes it may take a while to earn invest points but that's what makes if fun in my eye:)
B00FKPQHMU|5.0|I can't live in Second Life without my Space Navigator. When the cord finally broke after 7 years of constant use, I decided to get the new wireless space mouse. It didn't work at first but with some help from some friends I got it working perfectly. I will post a how to soon. If you are Second Life, and a builder you need a Space Navigator. It is the best building tool you can have because it allows precise placement of the camera in a way that lets you see exactly what you are doing. It is also great for moving around. Natural control of your camera and avatar easily toggled by the touch of a button. Couldn't recommend it more.
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|Excellent music and cinema photography.  If you like the Bee Gees you will love this DVD.  All their great songs and more.  This took place in 1997 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and even Olivia Newton John was in the audience.  And to top it off, it's in BluRay.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|As a book, it is a life-changer. I read 50 plus books each year and this book is the best that I have read in a very long time. I have given it to others and it gets the same praise. I will continue to give the book to friends and enemies. They will never be the same.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I heard alot of good things about this movie. So, I decided to sit down one Saturday afternoon and see what everyone was talking about. Boy was I pleasantly surprise! The whole story from start to finish was something you do not want to miss.
B000VX4X36|5.0|I love it,comfortable!<br />this is the first time my colleagues say which I am wearing is very unique and look good
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|This review is for the content of the actual episode as the DVD has not yet been released.<br />This episode is a fantastic one which can be enjoyed by fans of both the new and old series equally. Yet there are so many inside references that the newbie will actually lose out on the nuances I think.<br />I don't want to give away anything but I have to say that the most exciting prospect for the future of the series is that we will get to see Gallifrey portrayed the way it was meant to be! This has been the one thing I found lacking since the 2004 reboot - the boorish menace of the High Council who might at any time force the Doctor to do their dirty-work for them.<br />As for the episode itself, it really is a true celebration of 50 years of TARDIS travel. Even the idea of the Doctor meeting his former selves is a callback - especially David Tennant delivering the line &#34;Oh, I see you've redecorated ... I don't like it.&#34; in exactly the same way as Patrick Troughton did in &#34;The Three Doctors&#34; in 1972-73. Maybe the best moment of the entire episode is the meeting of Matt Smith (the current Doctor) and Tom Baker (the oldest living previous Doctor). One thing which I think will make all Whovians happy is that it has been all but declared that the old rule that Time Lords can only regenerate 13 times has essentially been overturned. It seems that as long as there is an audience for the show and people who love it working at the BBC to produce it, there will continue to be many new episodes of &#34;Doctor Who&#34;!<br />SPOILER ALERT!!! If you have not yet seen the episode and don't want to know any more, stop reading here!!!<br />The story itself clears up at least one huge mystery which has been plaguing fans both new and old - what exactly did the Doctor do to end the Last Time War? In some stories it seemed as if he burned Gallifrey to cinders but in others Gallifrey is described as being simply lost. And in &#34;The End Of Time&#34; the Time Lords actually did try to return. We now know (or at least I strongly suspect) that Moffat and Davies have been playing a long-game and have been working towards exactly this moment all along. Essentially, the Doctor used a weapon which had a conscience and could actually speak to him. Appearing in the form of Rose Tyler, whom this incarnation of the Doctor had not yet met, and calling itself Bad Wolf (see Season 1 of the new series) it decided that his punishment would be to survive the devastation. In allowing him to live, he then has time to think about the consequences and live with them - and maybe even change them! In the end, when Matt Smith is confronted by Tom Baker, he's told not only that he will have many many more incarnations - some even returning to old models in different apparent age-stages - but that Gallifrey is out there for him to find, if he wants to do so.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I was startled about the fact that it was not easy reading, and I do not know if I understood the essence of the stories.
B00BATG18K|5.0|I've waited for Amy Tan\\"s new book for a while, and I was not disappointed. Her voice for the Chinese culture is amazing, and very entertaining. Love it!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tried a couple of other programs that were not up to the job. Installing TubeMate has filled the bill perfectly!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I thought this was an amazing insight into a woman's prison. This was a great look from a person who would normally not be in jail with a prospective easy to comprehend.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|That was an amazing book!!! Could not put it down!!! True to john's great writing.  Can't wait for the next book!!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Amazing series of films, particularly #2 and #1 (in that order), and the amount of bonus content this set comes with is ridiculous. Highly recommend.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|You can never go wrong with a CD from the Piano Guys.  FABULOUS  OUTSTANDING  Truly inspirational and soul-touching music. My students listen with me at school as they read or work quietly. Soothes our bodies and minds.  Thank you for touching so many areas of our lives!
0061547840|5.0|Trump kicks your ass with his motivational talks, although I don't agree that you should always screw people back when they screw you, because you may start a chain of screwing if you are not careful.
B007SGM084|5.0|Bought on Black Friday-all 3 books for $8 total.  I have been wanting to get for over a year but hadn't due to cost.  I wanted to see what the rave was about.  I read a lot of mixed reviews-good and bad.  A lot of the bad reviews due to cost and that was why I hadn't purchased each book costing $10 each when I looked at them a year ago.  This was a good buy.  So cost isn't an issue any longer with what I paid.  Also, any bad reviews that just say this is constant sex or like a book porno, I do not agree at all.  There was so much more to the plot line and if the BDSM wasn't in there, Grey wouldn't have been able to be depicted as he really was.  This was needed to really understand him and the kind of man he was.  The development and ups and downs of their relationship seemed believable and not forced.  Great character development for both main characters and great supporting characters.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br />With that being said, a well written book.  I read 3+ books per week and have ready many BDSM books.  To me, this didn't have as much BDSM in there as I thought it would.  Book 1 was the most, then it tapered off.  I enjoyed the development of Christian and Ana's relationship throughout the book.  I didn't enjoy book 3 as much, mainly due all the emails in it.  All 3 books kind of had a different huge event that happened: 1-beginning of their relationships, major BDSM, break up 2-growth of the relationship, the fight, marriage 3-the weirdo issue with Jack and the pregnancy<br /><br />If you can get it for a steal like I did, I would definitely recommend it.  Should be interesting to see how this is able to be brought to life on the big screen.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Screen not big enough on my Kindle to be able to see the puzzle pieces when they're stacked to the side, which means  you have to drag a lot of pieces onto your working puzzle.  Fun enough, but not engaging.
B004G6009K|5.0|It's been awhile since I've enjoyed a Disney movie.  Watched this and loved it.  The video from the Blu-ray was really nice.  Would definitely recommend to all.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't have a Facebook account, so I have to buy my way to certain levels; that's the only reason I gave this game 4 instead of 5 stars.  It's addictive as heck, and loads of fun to play.  With limited moves to complete a level, it makes you plan ahead before making a move.  I would tell anyone to download it.....it's on my Kindle Fire.
1451695195|4.0|I got this book A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife for my mom back in November 2013 she likes it.
235250080X|5.0|I bought this as a gift along with another companion book. Easy reading with lots of pictures. I found things I didn't know existed.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game is cute, but quite repetitive.  You keep playing the same few mini games over and over to level up your ponies.  Earning 'bits' takes time and there are too many quests to keep up with.  Don't get me wrong, it is enjoyable!  But, I am just not sure this is going to be something I stick with.  I refuse to spend real money on a game like this.  You can buy things with money to move the game along faster, but I feel that would be quite pricey in the end!  If you don't mind taking forever to earn the 'bits' needed, then you will be fine.  Just plan to play the game for many hours a day, for a long time.<br /><br />  For a free App, it's great!  Just don't get trapped into paying for the bits and gems.  Quests will be thrown your way left and right.  Wanting you to build this or get that.  All of it costs bits or gems.  Bits and gems can be earned in game, it's just slow.  Very slow when you realize you have 10 plus quests the game wants you to complete!
2352500796|5.0|It is a complete book covering everything. I have used it numerous times at gun shows to verify originality. Easy read lots of pictures.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Amazing show, a must watch for all adults.  Gives a great image of the human condition and don't forget...theres zombies too!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was so excited to read this book. The first two books were very action packed and engaging that I expected a lot of Mockingjay. While it did have great moments I felt that this book lost a bit of momentum in parts until the ending. However, just as you got to where the action should have started it seemed to end way too fast. Some characters never seemed to have closure, others were skimmed over and the epilogue was way too short and there seemed to be a feeling of Collins just needed to have an ending and that was that. If you have invested yourself in the first two installments this is worth the effort to read. I just wish there was more and that is just my opinion.
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|I liked it overall. It was a little slow in the beginning but picked up in the end. However, I was disappointed in the cliff hanger ending. Although it was cliched and very predictable, I did enjoy it as an easy read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was so hesitant to read this book. Mostly because I watched the movie first and thought it was okay. Well, when I saw the previews for Catching Fire it looked so amazing I gave the books a go because I would much rather read the book first. So within 3 weeks I had all three novels read. This was a wonderful book and I recommend it to everyone that likes a dystopian society novels like Divergent. I found that I like the diversity of characters and society and the secrets that lie beyond. Read this and you are destined to want more.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|I am not a &#34;Treky&#34; but this movie was very enjoyable from start to finish. I love that it had a terrific message in saving our whales. A double banger as a result.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My absolute favorite book of the trilogy. It has action, romance, intrigue and intensity. If you read The Hunger Games then this is going to make you love the world of Panem even more. The characters are colorful and diverse. They are sinister, loyal and dangerous but all shall be revealed in good time. There are twists you won't see coming here and characters you will fall in love with and some you will love to hate.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Excellent, moving account of the VietNam war both over there and back home on Main Street USA. Mel Gibson and Madeleine Stowe give stellar performances. Glad I had kleenex near me.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I got this knife because of the high rating and positive reviews on youtube and knife forums. Out of the box the knife was not sharp at all but this is somewhat common in the world of inexpensive knives. The sheath is not that great and taking the knife out of it is a bit of a pain in the thumb. The handles are comfortable but too slippery.<br /><br /> So far I used the knife with the following tasks:<br /><br />(1) Fire wood Batoning. (A+)<br />(2) Chopped some thick &amp; dried tree branches with it to make slingshots. (A)<br />(3) Making feather stick. (A)<br />(4) Removed the bark off the wood for the slingshots. (B)<br />(5) Rough carving on the slingshots. (C)<br />(5) Skinning and butchering a rabbit. (D)<br /><br />Overall the knife is tough and rugged and it will make a great outdoor or survival knife.<br /><br />For small tasks its a major overkill. Skinning with it failed miserably because it is too bulky and the edge dull very fast.<br /><br />I am giving it 4 star because it is a beast of a knife and owing one could prove very helpful in outdoor activities or survival.<br /><br />Buy one and get a small knife with it for detail work.<br /><br />Beat it hard and enjoy it toughness.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Entertaining! Drags a little throughout but maintains its suspense. Story ended favorably well. Denzel of course comes off smashing as usual.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|There was a time or two in the second book and possibly in the first book that a sentence needed reworking. Whiles it's slightly possible that kindle had disrupted the print.<br /><br />I read these books over the course of three days after watching the second movie a day or two after it came out and I've probably cried a hundred times. I hate to see it end but it was fantastic! I'm in love with Peeta and Katniss and the things they represent in people.
B0026KX6TY|4.0|Great Movie! Showed the real family struggles of a young boy being encouraged to develop his potential. Max Pomeranc is excellent. I loved his big eyes and being able to see his mind work through his struggles.
B0029VUV70|5.0|excellent. it's been years since i've added any movie/film to my list of favorites....that is until today. definitely one i'll view again and again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well, It's Candy Crush Saga.  On kindle fire.  What else is there to say. It syncs with my pc game on my facebook account
B00C7607BC|4.0|Happy customer.  I downloaded the digital copy and put it onto my iPad so the kids could watch it while traveling during Thanksgiving. Worked like a charm.  Too bad it was the only movie I had so I heard it at least 3 times on our 7 hour trip.......both ways......
B00F2362IE|3.0|It is a fun game and my child really enjoys playing it.  However, it requires some significant real money for power ups and the game download is very large.  It causes a significant slow down on my android device.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|This game is quick to learn and quick to play. I taught and played a game with a smart seven-year-old in about an hour, and she won. There's just enough luck to keep a highly strategic player from crushing a casual player, and yet there's somehow enough strategy to keep a serious player interested.<br /><br />The quick game-play means we'll often play a few games in a row. I'd say replay-ability is very high this one just because it's fun and there are enough random elements to keep it interesting. Then there's the artwork, which is so so good. All of the components are really great quality and look beautiful.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cute Panda<br />Quick to Play<br />Quick to Teach<br />Fun<br />Great Artwork and Components<br />Even the rulebook is fun<br />A little luck<br /><br />Cons:<br />Could use an expansion just to shake things up a little.
1451666179|5.0|Love love LOVE it. I've been a big fan for awhile and this is a fantastic book. I keep it out in the living room and guests love checking it out. I've had a few friends say they were going to buy it. Great jokes, great stories, hilarious drawings.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|love, love, love this series!  However not crazy about getting only two episodes per dvd.  It is disappointing that there were no extras on the disks except for episodes of Mrs. Columbo.  The information about the content of each disk is written on the inside of the case which cannot be read without having to remove the disks.  Also the episodes do not seem to be organized in the order that they originally aired.  But, I am loving curling up on the couch with Lt Colombo once again.
B00EY7LT9Q|2.0|Watched the first 3 episodes. Not impressed. The characters are so cliche it's painful, the two scientists are the same character separated only by name and body.. The saving grace of this show is just showing that Coulson lived. VFX are good but the writing and characters are so bland it's just not up to par with some of the shows coming out this season. I may come back to it during the summer when there's nothing to watch but for now other shows are more worth my time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Just love this app for any calculation need! I use it frequently.  Easy to use. Always available with WiFi on my kindle.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|There is a bit of a hum on this mic but otherwise it gives some pretty solid sound without picking up everything in the room. I've been using for over a year and it's done well with my t3i
0756655307|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and after receiving it I know he will love it!  First off it's the size of a text book which surprised me and it's very long, which should keep him busy for a while, lol!  Anyone who loves Marvel will flip over this encyclopedia.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|Pretty much exactly what I expected. Lots of eye candy action with a mediocre plot. It's worth a watch if you know that going in. It's a TON better than it's prequel.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|could beat in 4 moves. poor programing. what more can i say, programers forgot fools mate iat the advanced level
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've had this backpack over a year, thrown in in the car, climbed a mountain with it, all the buckles are intact, the straps are still secure. None of the stitching is coming out. Amazing purchase, good cushioning for DSLR and a few lenses and accessories.
B00FQMVCEA|4.0|very cute, and creative love all the caracters great uplifting story. Be more than you were built for! Dream Big
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Very well written and constant in keeping<br /> the reader enticed.  Visually poetic in descriptions of events.<br />Even the ugly and dark lives of his family are acutely shared.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Worth the wait - not sure. A good read? Of course - classic Martin leaves you wanting more, hating him, loving him and thoroughly depressed over the inevitable 5 year wait (if we're lucky) until the next installment.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I love the game.  Patience I have, money I don't.  This beautifully made game can get very expensive.  Glitches are still being worked out.
B00CIVLZ3U|3.0|Not Sanderson's best - bit contrived in places and the protagonist is very difficult to warm too. Another 18 year old genius... yawn.
1609611543|1.0|don't waste your money on this diet. It is not going to work. I know I tried it. That is all I can say
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|good o k not paying for stuff fun to play what what was up with all the ads who reads that stuff anyway .
B00EPFEZJI|5.0|Joan Jett is a Rock N Roll Queen who doesn't Act Like One! I saw Joan in Columbus, Ohio at the Zucchinni Festival in 2012. She performed 4 of the new songs here. I was so happy to see her. &#34;TMI' & &#34;Hard To Grow Up&#34; are awesome. This whole Album is new JJ tracks that she wrote or co-wrote. I think it's her best since 1994's &#34;Pure & Simple&#34;. Here's hoping this new Lp does well & JJ comes to Columbus again. Highly Recommended!!!!!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I loved the show and the bundle was a great price.  Buying the complete series was less expensive than getting season 2 and 3... NOW I have to sell Season One
B004EBT6HE|4.0|This is can entertaining book, and worth reading 100%.  The reason I gave it four stars is because, all other books I have read by Follett I have found difficult to put down and finished them very quickly.  This book took much longer and I did not look as forward to getting to read as I normally do. But it was enjoyable and extremely creative...I appreciate the plot very much.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Use Amazon.co.uk as others have suggested, the shipping is dirt cheap for international to the US, and the set is superior to the version here.  You'll get it at a 60 dollar savings if this is on sale for the regular price on the US Amazon, or about a 15 dollar savings with 3 additional discs if its on sale here.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Outstanding book. I've been a fan of John Green for a while now, but this was the first of his books that I've read.
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|Solid software, cool, sturdy, quiet. Everything you expect from Asus. Runs new every game on ultra! ArcGIS, CS6 and other needy programs run with ease when paired with my i7 4770 and Asus Z87I-Deluxe board!
B0070XB0N6|5.0|It's Neil Gaiman. What more needs to be said? One of my favorites; give it a read even if you've seen the movie.
B000002O4X|5.0|This is incredibly  beautiful  music  from a  great composer.  Captures  the  mood  of  the  era l  as well as  the spirit of Africa.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is the send-up to end all send-ups of the Whodunnit genre.  Herein is a totally stellar cast of actors and actresses in what has to be one of the funniest suspense movies ever made.  I refuse to be a spoiler, so if you want to know any more, then buy the CD.  I promise you; you will NOT be sorry you did.  It is a five-star hoot!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works well on my droid. I use it everyday. I like how you can add descriptions. The timer works easily.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This CD is perhaps one of the best that the Dead ever turned out.  Songs like &#34;pigpen's&#34; &#34;Operator&#34; and the favorite &#34;Ripple&#34; and &#34;Truckin'&#34; make this a standout album.  This is a &#34;must have&#34; for any &#34;Dead-head.&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|SPOILER ALERT. John Green has the ability to make his reader both fall in love with the characters and be heartbroken by them (especially when they die). I enjoy his writing style very much as it is fresh, witty, and real. This story was not my favorite of his but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Put this app on my wife's Kindle Fire.  Allows here to view and explore files that she was not able to access before.
B00E687MWQ|2.0|This is NOT true black metal! I love their older stuff and their newer stuff but this album. It just plain sucks. Only maybe one song will get you fired up, the rest is very slow and weak. Too bad.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book. Finished the second one and will be reading the third one soon. Beyond all the racy stuff, there is a story line that makes you sympathetic to the characters.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|A &#34;must have&#34; in every family's Christmas music collection!  This CD has a permanent spot in my stereo for the entire month of December from now on!
B004A8ZWWY|4.0|Movie is very funny. The cast was well chosen and the subject matter is very funny. Not a huge Stiller fan, but he does well in this movie
B002SRQ214|5.0|This CPU is awesome.  While it is clocked at 3.4ghz from the factory, most units can be overclocked to around 4.0 - 4.2ghz on air cooling.  Even though the FX series processors have been released a while ago this processor is not a waste of money.  The processor can stand it's ground and will provide you with good frame rates when playing cpu intensive games.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys put their heart and soul into each song that they perform or compose.  It was with eager anticipation that I waited for their Christmas CD to come out.  I wasn't disappointed.  I listened to &#34;Angels We Have Heard on High&#34; on the CD before I watched the video.  I did not realize the unique and creative way that they played this song.  I love the mix of songs from soulful to upbeat. Definitely a must for every family!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Absolutely fabulous! I love this CD. It has beauitful, inspiring Christmas music that I can listen to at any time!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|You will love this. Fun twist on favorite songs. My kids and I cant get enough of it! We especially love Winter Wonderland.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|If just got this app and if you are another 13 year older expecting a cute and interesting app well im just saying, in my oppinion, its  boring me to death. It might be interesting to a 4 year old but its just another learning games. &quot;Move this peace of candy over here to make 3 candys in a row!&quot; Really? Well there you go dont get it unless your eather a 4 year old or you want to bore your self to death like i did. Totaly deleating this app
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just finished reading this book. First of all, as many reviewers have said, you could only tell whose perspective this book was from because of the chapter titles and pronouns. Second of all, the ending seemed like the writing of someone who went to school for an MFA and studied the formula of writing good novels but did not feel it with her heart. I think the author ran out of creativity and her choice of ending was the only one she could come up with for a dramatic ending. Shakespeare could pull this kind of ending off....Roth was not able to do so. I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the book's ending completely; however, I wish I'd read the spoilers and not bothered with the book.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season was so suspenseful and really tied everything together. The intensity that was missing from last season was back!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is a fabulous addition to my Christmas music collection. The Piano Guys do a great job with the songs we grew up hearing every year.. i bought one for myself and another as a gift for a friend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I personally love this book and how their was so much action in the whole book. the first hunger games book was good but this one was just amazing. I would mostly recommend this book to people in middle school and high school
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|What an awesome portrayal of challenges women face in the workplace. Every young girl should have this book as a graduation present, it will surely come in handy. Every man who is interested in empowering women and girls, you have to buy it. .....Sit at the table and be counted!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Read this if you loved the hunger games.  This is for those harsh girly girls or popular girls.  Enjoy your reading! :b
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Brilliant read...loved the way he would go back to history to explain current success stories.Made me really think hard about where I am in history, and how I can help myself and those around me, especially my kids to take advantage of the times. @sellonkoana @mjtrevor1
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle became so fast after I used it. I really like,  recommend that for you all. Now I am enjoying a faster  equipment.
1250038820|4.0|As a big fan of HONY I expected more.<br /><br />I preordered it and was looking forward to it, but I found a smaller than expected book, the layout wasn't &#34;wow&#34; and the font was just &#34;off&#34;.<br /><br />Also, I felt it had too many &#34;one liners&#34; as opposed to the way the many nice short conversations that appear on the website.<br /><br />Overall it's definitely a nice coffee-table book, I just thought they could've easily done a better job on a few fronts. A shame.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Lots of fun. This has made some of the longest airline waits a snap! Keep up the good work!! Can't wait for the next edition.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Needs the newest update where you spin for free items needs to be better if gets the newest version could be 5 stars
B007N8RULO|1.0|didn't load, wouldn't start, just kept telling me there was an error and to download again.  if it doesn't work, i don't keep it
B00000AFGM|5.0|Im not here to persuade or dissuade you, but to show my gratitude and pay my respects. This piece of art fulfills Hegel's prophecy.
B0000073BG|2.0|I thought this was actually Scheherazade, the symphony. So maybe the two star rating is for me and my lack of intelligence regarding what I was buying or thought I was buying. I gave the cd to someone who was quite excited. That part worked for me.
B003YTLKTE|4.0|Having been to Ireland this past fall, the movie brought back many memories of the trip. I was disappointed with the ending. I won't say why as people will then know what to expect. Maybe a sequel to tell the rest of the story. Therefore 4 stars vs. 5.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is a fantastic device and will really change the game of home streaming media as the simplicity and portability will enable it to take it with you and get it to work wherever wifi is available.  Thru the downloadable Chromecast app from the iOS or Android Play Store, pairing thr CC to your mobile device is simple and you can pair your CC with multiple devices and simply use whatever device is closest at hand to start operations.  Even if you shut off or reboot your mobile device, streaming playback is uninterrupted on the CC and operations can even be picked up on a different paired device.<br /><br />Right now streaming services are limited to the major players (netflix, hulu plus, pandora, hbo Go) but hopefully the list of supported services will continue to grow and once the SDK is released then other features will be opened up including streaming of local content
1567184855|5.0|I am only half way through this book, but it is AMAZING!! I won't go into any long summary since anyone interested can Google that, but I will say that I HIGHLY recommend it!! I haven't been able to put it down!
B00EHMG358|5.0|Always anticipate these books and I'm never disappointed.  Where do they come with these page turning plots?<br />A real edge of the chair thriller
B008LV8TSU|5.0|When I had first started to read the book I thought that I wouldn't like it. But after reading the first couple of chapters and getting a feel for the characters and the plot, I was very interested in discovering what happened at the end of the book. I loved it
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I purchased the Whisper Sync version of this book, and I'm glad I did. It's a pretty long book. So unless you have plenty of time to sit and read, it will take you a long time to finish it. Plus, with the Whisper Sync version, it's a full cast of voice actors and they really did a marvelous job in relaying all the emotions of scene in the book.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it's never truly addressed how Jonathan Harker managed to escape. He served his purpose, and with all that he knew about the Count, he should have been dinner for the three lady vamps. Anyway, it's still a nice read. It captured my attention from start to end.<br /><br />PS: You should definitely buy the Whisper Sync version!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|For me it's kind of revolutionary. It seemed like a conspiracy of loud people was just part of the fabric of the earth, however it is a recent invention and as someone who is 50/50 introvert/extrovert this was a relief. If you are mostly introverted you will learn valuable life lessons from this book.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys always have an exciting twist on classy! Fun to listen to, fun to watch, familiar and unexpected, their music brings joy any time of the year.
098478280X|5.0|Great book.<br />It explains how to pass programming interview.<br />A lot of tiny details you would never think about are covered.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Life, Love and Hope vindicates the musical talents of Tom Scholz and the remaining members of Boston. The guitars, organs and other instruments are compelling and replete with virtuosity. Several vocalists combine to make this a very good album. The myriad Highlights are referenced below.    1) Heaven On Earth  2) Life, Love and Hope  3) Someday  4) Love Got Away  5) Someone  6) You Gave Up On Love  7) The Way You Look Tonight  8) Last Day of School (Instrumental)    Boston is a riveting live band and now they have some really good new songs to further enhance their concert performances ! \\"Heaven On Earth\\" \\"Life, Love and Hope\\" and \\"Last Day Of School\\" will be ideal concert songs.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Cannot stream local videos. Google blocked this aability just after I made the purchase. I bought it specifically for watching my personal videos on the TV.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A very strange story. But it had me hooked just so I could try to figure out what exactly was going on AMD what was going to happen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it's really cool but I'm wondering when it's gonna be updated other than that it's just plain amazing so you should try it out for yourself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's a action packed, drama filled, tear jerker. I love it. I read it in two days. I was sucked into Katniss Everdeen's head!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what a calculator does. No more no less. It is sufficient. I have no complaints about its performance. It works fine
B00GX50BD2|5.0|Stunning, insightful & inspirational! Not a huge Ashton Kutcher fan, but he was PHENOMENAL in this film! One of the best films I have seen in a while :)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Cool game for dad, finally. I play it  for about fifteen minutes at a time, at the end of a long day at work, it's nice to shoot something.......lol......anger management for free
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I had read A Time to Kill twice before, and I had read it again before I did Sycamore Row, and still I didn't have enough. Thank you again, Mr. Grisham for this once again terrific novel. I'll keep hoping for at least another one like these two in the near future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|u hav to get this game soo much fun its like havin your own horse u get to feed it and take pics love it loooooovvvvvveee it
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Classic Christmas music at its finest! I bought this cd on iTunes and it is truly amazing! The Piano Guys rock, and this cd is going to be a classic to have in your library. Buy it!!
6304400551|5.0|Perfect video quality. It also includes a booklet of the award winning songs and you can sing along. A classic story for all movie libraries.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Just finished this excellent book...I found it informative, exciting and heartbreaking.  I would have preferred it was a novel and not a real life situation.  So much for political correctness...what those poor guys went through...they were amazing!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Have been waiting for a while for this. Now that it is out I'm really happy. Runs smoothly and graphics look amazing on my kindle fire hd
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Had to laugh, because it works very well. Better then I thought. It installed very easy, and was running in few minutes.<br /><br />Con:Tried to play some online games with it like Tera, but it dosen't work for it. But for other things like youtube it works great.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Being a huge mystery lover I have to admit that it had been a long time since I’d read such an original murder mystery novel. This book was recommended to me by a good friend and I am so glad that I listened to him! I would certainly recommend Time Killer to anyone looking for a great murder mystery novel that leaves you on the edge of your seat. This book literally draws you in from the very first line! The story was so suspenseful and fast paced that I couldn’t put it down until I finished it. This book has all the essential elements of a great story: realistic characters, an in-depth plot, and suspense that will not let you put the book down. I also loved how there was such an intense energy portrayed between the two main characters Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlaine. If you are a murder mystery fan and you are not sensitive to bloody scenes, you will absolutely love this book.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed playing this game, but every time there is an update it restarts my whole town! It happened to me twice so far, so I'm done with this game. It is fun to accomplish the quests by building buildings and collecting from them, but it's annoying losing my progress from level 95 then level 50! There are many other glitches including prices for land expansions, and not counting certain actions as completed. The compensation packages are generous, but it doesn't give back the town you worked hard on. Don't download it's full of glitches!
B00GX598FO|3.0|Too much comedy in an action film is not good. Bruce Willi's wife served no reasonable function. The first red was better.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Excellent!  The recalibration option cured the annoying error message I kept getting &#34;Battery<br />has stopped&#34; -everthing else is equally useful.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and more emotional. I love Benny this season. Plus shipping was quick. It is a very good show.
B002ZG974M|3.0|My teenage daughter loves anything about babies, & I was hoping this would be really interesting.  It was okay... but not nearly as informative as I expected, so we were disappointed in the educational value.  Maybe it would actually be more fun for a baby to watch other babies.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Just what I was looking for, just attach it turn it on and the camera does the rest . I use it all the time now as it improves pictures taken due to improving the lighting and its powerful enough for day time shooting. Works on 2 double A batteries. Not disappointed in the least!
B00G3HSF7O|4.0|I thought it was a good, entertaining movie.  That's all I ask for in a movie, and Matt Damon is great as usual.
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|Better then recovery couple good song a cd more for the lyricists, still uses the cheesy punch all an all a good cd
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is one of the best musicals to come out of Hollywood in any era.  Robert Preston and Shirley Jones are ideal in the this early 20th Century setting.  Beautiful music and wonderfully quirky characters fill out Willson's masterpiece.  Get it, watch it and laugh out loud.  76 cheers for this marvelous film!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Pure Genious. The tracks are great, an awesoe follow up to the first Marshall Mathers LP. The deluxe is worth it
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Couldn't put it down, didn't want it to end.<br /><br />I don't want to bore you with eleven more words that are required for submittal.
0764141201|5.0|There are a lot of useful ph verbs in the book. If you don't mind spend a lot of time studying this book, you could learn many things to improve your English skills
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Excellent read, Gladwell does a brilliant job in helping explain the giant vs. little one love the read and take on the large vs. small classrooms.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|This was a cute movie. Can't believe  I had not heard of it before now.  I bought is as a gift.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We've listened to this cd four times since opening it two days ago!  My kids love it, I love it, even my 2-yr old loves it!  Definitely worth adding to your collection.  Another Piano Guys success!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I really do not need to say much.  Sheldon, Penny, Leonard, Raj and Wolowitz.  No more needs to be said. Enjoy the laughs and the science.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its cool. Fun use of free time while watching tv and easy to play on my kindle. You can interact with the animal air more then most games
B009346RSS|5.0|I use this to get best audio from the Mac Book Pro retina optical audio output, which is in 96KHz/24bit format.  The analog sound outputs from this converter is simply amazing and just perfect whether I play a music file from the PC, a HD movie, or soft synth.<br /><br />Note that it does not come with a USB power adapter so I use an 5V/1A generic USB adapter, and it works perfectly to power this converter.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Works well for me. I love the way it searches. Will use it often and like the ease of it.
0399160477|5.0|I am sure the book is great, because all of his are.  But I find it sad that they all get shorter when written by these other writers.  This is as thick as the ones Clancy actually wrote, but it has half as many words and a ton of white space.  It feels more like a John Grisham or Sidney Sheldon book.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Hard read. Rather watch the movie or go to the play. Too much detail in old fashion reading for me
B008JFUS28|5.0|[Caveat: I have to confess that I'm a huge fan of the Marvel Thor mythology and have read the comics off and on through the years ever since I was a kid. I state that upfront so you understand that my review of this film is viewed through that lens. However, I still feel the film is fun and entertaining for everyone even if you're not that familiar with the character. There are at least three or four things in this film that are worth the price of admission alone.]<br /><br />I can't imagine that a fan of the character Thor would be disappointed with this film. It builds on all the elements that Kenneth Branagh established in the first film and ups the ante across the board. Everything is bigger: the battles, the cast, the sets, the visual effects, the soundtrack, the entire scope. The costumes are amazing. I wish they looked this good the first time around. And Asgard is incredible. Alan Taylor has brought the eternal realm to life in a way that Branagh did not. It is still majestic but it feels much more real and actually &#34;lived in&#34;.<br /><br />Further, the actors from the first movie have really grown into their roles. Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular are the very embodiment of their characters. Hiddleston has much more material to work with from an actor's perspective with regards to Loki - a tormented and duplicitous soul - but he's so good at it. Whereas Hemsworth plays the cocksure Thor in a much more understated fashion. Thor is not complex but has a big heart. Bringing him to life requires subtlety and Hemsworth nails it. Neither actor oversells their role. Not only that, they have tremendous chemistry with each other and every scene in which they are together steals the show. As a fan who realizes how horribly wrong these movies could've gone with such an outrageous premise, I am so grateful that Marvel found these two actors to play the most vital parts of the story.<br /><br />The creators of the film version of Thor had a difficult choice integrating into the universe and tone that Favreau established in the first Iron Man. In the comics, there's magic and there's sci fi and other dimensions and all that stuff and you just accept it. In the reality-based technology-centric world Iron Man created, how do you introduce a viking god from space who soars around with a magic hammer? In fact, Favreau even admitted he had no idea how it could be done. However, Branagh did find a way and he did it by emphasizing the science fiction aspects of the mythology Jack Kirby and Stan Lee concocted 50 years ago. Taylor now had the unenviable job of taking that idea and running with it without it falling apart at the seams. In my opinion he succeeded. The result is Dark Elves in space ships. It's a bizarre mix and maybe a lot of people won't get it. But it feels like a comic book sprung to life and I loved it.<br /><br />The only legitimate complaint that I feel this movie deserves is that at times it feels too compressed. (However, I also felt that way about the first film.) It's amazing that for such a short run time The Dark World truly does feel epic, but there's so much going on in this story between Earth and Asgard and the other realms that things don't always get enough time to breathe. I believe this strategy of Marvel is to keep moving the story forward at a brisk pace for the grander scheme of things while maintaining the widest possible appeal for a broad audience - but I'd like to them to linger a little more in a juicy chapter like this. I think even 5 or 10 minutes of added scenes could've put this film over the top and helped flush out certain characters' motives and let you feel more attachment to them. Alan Taylor has said it was very difficult for him to cut out several scenes and is the first Marvel director who has said he'd be keen on doing a Director's Cut. Boy would I love to see that!<br /><br />Things I liked about The Dark World:<br /><br />* Character arc of Thor - Thor is growing wiser andshrewder but still retaining his bravado. The lessons he experienced in the first film have made him question things more in this one. His relationship with Odin ebbs and flows like real life and in this film we see that father and son are not so different from each other. In the end Thor makes a surprising choice that mirrors his actions from the comics.<br /><br />* Character arc of Loki - Loki finds redemption - or does he? His motives are always ambiguous and questionable and he certainly is headed on a darker path. However, the events that unfold here give you more insight into who he is and why he does the things he does<br /><br />* The funeral scene - Not wanting to spoil things here but you'll know it when you see it. Amazing.<br /><br />* Sci-fi/fantasy mashup - Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. The comics was always a weird juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous ideas and this film embraces it and it works.<br /><br />* Algrim the Kursed - wow! This guy is scary.<br /><br />* Fun plot twists - Loki isn't the only trickster in this film!<br /><br />* Thor and Jane Foster make a cute pair - others may disagree but their romance to me is very innocent and sweet and I feel she plays the starry eyed scientist bit to a tee. It's not a huge part of the film but their scenes work and it helps humanize Thor and keep him connected to Earth. I also am very old fashioned and I love how gallantly protective Thor is of Jane and I love that she is equally protective of him.<br /><br />* Creative battle scenes - especially the last one which produces some ridiculous situations and leave's Thor's hammer Mjolnir VERY confused!<br /><br />* A healthy dose of humor injected to keep the film from ever taking itself too seriously but not overdone<br /><br />* Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig - you see that Tony Stark is not the only one impacted by the events of Avengers. This man is a genius but Loki's mind games have really messed him up. Even so Skarsgård is a tremendous actor and really sells it. I enjoyed his part of the story and how he unravels the mystery of the convergence despite his mental state.<br /><br />Bottom line this film is fun escapism ala Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Don't expect poignant existential validation or heavy handed political commentary. This film is a good time. It's also an exciting chapter in a much larger story that is the MCU.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book manages to take a situation that can't always be related to from experience, and make it deeply personal for the reader. Also, it is sad. This book will break your heart into a million pieces. Be prepared.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my gma loves this game. she is in her 80's keeps her thinking. easy to do with her arthrities hands
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|This book was similar to a time to kill exploring the same themes and taking place in the same setting but lacked any of the excitement of it.  The characters are stereotypical to the Deep South and the plot is terribly predictable. Save your time and money, I wish I had.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The simplicity of this device is both it success and failure.<br /><br />My home network is fairly standard for a business man with the exception that I often connect to my office.  Other than a solid firewall and a fixed IP address everything else pretty standard.  I use a Cisco router that doesn't support Universal Plug & Play and a hot company connection means I need to use my company DNS (Windows Active Directory) servers or I can't find  the corporate resources I need.  DHCP is disabled to prevent casual, unwanted connections.  I use WPA2 Enterprise instead of Personal because I initially login via a radius server for authentication.<br /><br />Chromecast doesn't work on my network, it;s not really very different but for Chrome cast to work, it's all wrong.  Chromecast absolutely cannot be used where the network is complicated in any way.  it allows only an automated configuration and that works on only the most basic of networks where the configuration is exactly what it expects to find and the lack of any way to  manual configure it is a show stopper.<br /><br />So the takeaway is :-<br /><br />If you take one to the office expecting it to work, it almost certainly won't.<br />If you don't have a DHCP server to issue an address, it won't work.<br />if you disable UP&P for security or you're router lacks UP&P capability it won't work<br />It will (eventually) work on most networks without WPS capability but it's slow to connect for some reason. This is odd, it doesn't need or use WPS for anything but if it's disabled or the router lacks WPS it connects much more slowly.<br />If you use anything other than WPA2 Personal (or none at all), it won't work.<br />If yo need a DNS source other than Google you're out of luck, it won't do it.<br /><br />In short, it only works with one network configuration, if yours differs by any of the above, it won't work.<br /><br />It seems a shame, had the developers taken a few minutes and included a few lines of code to enablemanual configuration it would probably work almost anywhere, probably even most cooperate networks.<br /><br />AFH
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Best album to date. Each song has a special meaning, and knowing that britney wrote on all of them makes it even better.  Tik Tik Boom is one of my personal favorites, along with Don't Cry.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|This game has a good story line and great game play plus the puzzles were fun and some were challenging.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|All in all this is a good read.  I loved the fact that the main character was a woman!  I thought is was very interesting that the author decided to throw some rated r moments in there!<br /><br />For some reason I am fascinated with distopian societies that take place in the future.<br /><br />This book was very reminiscent of 1984 and also anthem by Ayn Rand.<br /><br />I never thought of Eggers as a philosopher but now I do.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|I think this is an underrated movie.  If you have a doting parent, I think you will relate and enjoy!  I bought a copy for my parents, and they enjoyed it as well.  It's not stressful.  It's not raucous.  It's sweet, and interesting, and funny.
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Quality movie - Funny and engaging<br />Great movie to watch on Saturday afternoon chemistry between actors spot on.  Some unexpected<br />twists add to the plot which are funny.
0374533571|5.0|The book is different from the movie, as is often the case.  But I wouldn't say one is better than the other.  This is one of those happy occasions when the book and movie are great companions to each other.<br /><br />I met the author at a book festival, and he is so nice!
B001LF3YQK|5.0|This is the best wipe holder I have ever bought, the closure is very sturdy and it holds a lot of wipes without being too  bulky
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I bought this for my parents because I really enjoyed it.  There was too much swearing for mom!  And although my dad thought it was a little wacky, he wanted to keep it instead of giving it back to me.<br /><br />When I first watched it, I was worried it was going to be too dark and depressing.  But it is an uplifting story.  And it's different from the usual fare.  I also recommend reading the book.  While the story is a bit different, it is a great companion to the movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I loved how Ender was able to keep his kindness throughout all the things that were happening to him. I felt frustrated by his tormentors and cheered when he overcame the circumstances that he was presented with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone started playing this game and I said &quot;no way&quot; I am sorry I waited so long. This game is challenging and doesn't just hand you success. You have to earn it and wait and be patient. Good clean I mean sweet fun!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|After being a fan for a while, I wanted to see the first episodes because I hadn't seen them.  They knock it out of the park.  Ever watch old Seinfield?  It is sometimes painful.  This is awesome thru and thru.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I enjoyed reading this for several reasons: the ideas put forth about pleasure being more important than happiness,  finding one's soul through the senses, the value of beauty over goodness and so on. Surely Mr.Wilds is the devils advocate!
B004GJYROG|5.0|A classic. My son, who is an avid Chicago Bulls fan, was delighted when I produced this movie. He didn't know who the Looney Tunes were, but he didn't care because he is a huge Jordan fan.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I did not start watching until the Matt Smith episodes, but I love the interactions between Rose and this Doctor... it's FANTASTIC!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Piano Guys music always inspires and uplifts!  The compositions are creative and beautiful. What a wonderful album to listen to this time of year.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|This is such a cute movie. The art work of the Indianapolis track is superb. I plan to share this movie with smaller family members. I know they will love it.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Most of this book seems to be a prelude to his next -fine-however the story is much slower in development than earlier books. I enjoy the story and will continue to read but he inundates the reader with character after character, most of which have extremely minor roles in the story development.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Surprisingly smooth and very enjoyable. You can play for a while to before running out of energy, but if you do run out switch your cards and boom. Good to go for more.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is my favourite app! I have a fanfiction account and I can write fine on my kindle fire. A MUST have!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Great CD and DVD!  So glad I bought it... actually bought 4 copies - 3 to give away as gifts!  Yes... in my books it's that good! Check it out for yourself although listening on a computer doesn't do it justice... it comes alive on a Bose! :-)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very cool game. The quickest will survive.in order to be on top you got to have very good reflexes. Although unlocking the charactors can take some time.
B00CE03UOC|2.0|Though it gets increasingly difficult, it is a visually boring game and is just the same thing over and over.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|My daughter bought me this kindle fire hd and it doesn't support flash drive I have been struggling to find an app that works so far so good.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Very good show. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Some nudity/drugs/foul language; wouldn't recommend for younger audience. Denzel Washington is awesome.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy Perry does it again.  Another fabulous album, and my favorite song on it is Spiritual.  Just a phenomenal song!  Every song is great and this album is a must have!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but felt the ending was lacking a bit.  I was hopeful there would be more about the main character's life after the war, as well as her surviving Jewish friend, Max, and was disappointed there wasn't more.  Apart and aside from that, I found it to be a lovely story.
B008JFUOVI|3.0|I loved both Part 1 and 2 but this one was just not as funny at all. I'm still glad I bought it.
B00GT67UUM|5.0|A total joy to play. Great looking streampunk gadgets, enjoyable music, overall a fantastic experience. Played it a ton on PS3's home app, was so thrilled when it arrived for Kindle. Very fun for any level of gamer. Pick it up and play for 10 min or 10 hours, you'll enjoy it.
B004IWR06S|5.0|I  Love this movie. I had seen it before and wanted for it my library of dvd's. I was a little surprised that Clint Eastwood directed it. He did a good job. You think of him for his rough and tuff movies. However this movie was good and very sad.This movie really gets you thinking. My kind of movie. Want a good cry try this movie. I give five big stars and an A++++++ Just a good movie.....<br />PS the seller got it to me fast and in good  shape. Thank you again...
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Apple TV is $100 but its actually worth it. This thing is $35 and its waste of money. Reason why is because it freezes... only works for netflix and youtube, and you'll always have problem controlling whatever you're watching... by the time it pauses you're already back to your seat ready to watch again.<br /><br />Do Not Waste YOUR MONEY!
B00DD49R0E|4.0|That 2010’s “Despicable Me” turned out to be an enormous hit is a bit of a surprise. Perfectly pleasant but also unremarkable, the feature scratched a certain audience itch at the time, striking a distinct cartoon blow while introducing the world to the hyperactive comedy antics of the minions -- those miniature yellow slapstick machines that eventually made Universal Pictures a mint in merchandise sales. Well, the minions are back, along with Gru and his adoptive children, with “Despicable Me 2” perfectly content to replicate humor and spectacle for its adoring audience. However, with the lead character now playing for the good guys, certain changes have been made to the freshly-minted franchise, a few ideas that keep this sequel entertaining but never remarkable.<br /><br />Now a domesticated man living with his three daughters, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher), former supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) is content to be a dad, organizing birthday parties and perfecting a line of jellies and jams with help from his loyal minions and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand). When a secret serum containing the power to make monsters out of anyone is stolen from a lab, the Anti-Villain League requests Gru’s help with retrieval, paring up the hopelessly single man with Lucy (Kristen Wiig), a flighty but fierce agent. Sent undercover into a mall to spy on dubious shopkeepers who might be hiding the serum, Gru and Lucy bond over their shared love of gadgets and interest in the evildoing of others. Their top suspect is Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), a Mexican restaurateur who reminds Gru of El Macho, a once potent bad guy bent on destruction. As minions are pinched, Margo falls in love with Eduardo’s son Antonio (Moises Arias), and Dr. Nefario quits the fruit preserve game, Gru is left to save the world, which isn’t nearly as frightening as being honest with his feelings for Lucy.<br /><br />Inoffensive yet undercooked, “Despicable Me” took its time revealing a personality and storytelling drive, though its interest in CG-animated silly business was refreshing, rarely halting the antics to adhere to emotional bullet points the competition is often slavish to. The sequel continues the misadventures of Gru, who’s now a family man seen dressing up as a fairy princess for Agnes’s delight, also turning his cavernous lair into a food factory with hopes to erase his supervillain past for good, much to the concern of Dr. Nefario, who’s looking for more of a challenge. The next logical step for Gru’s dramatic progression is one of heroism, and the opportunity arrives with the Anti-Villain League invitation, offering the once malevolent man a shot as toppling evil for a change, which happens to be housed in a domed mall filled with cutesy shop names and lively tenants. Suddenly, Gru’s a secret agent, with Lucy his partner and a few minions along for support. “Despicable Me 2” doesn’t cough up a radical plot, but it’s passable, making distinct moves to inch away from the original’s satiric narrative interests.<br /><br />The mall subplot is a letdown, with the script initially promising an expansive space teeming with suspicious types, allowing Gru and Lucy to pore through tenant behavior. Instead of many, we meet two: Eduardo and wigmaker Floyd (Ken Jeong), and it’s clear from the outset who’s the actual guilty party. Even for a family film, the mystery isn’t very mysterious, a deflating realization that keeps “Despicable Me 2” from trouncing its predecessor in the tomfoolery department, missing a chance to expand the suspect list and widen the potential for humor. However, actual jokes aren’t exactly a priority for directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, who stuff the effort with bathroom humor, including the use of a “fart gun” to score cheap laughs. “Despicable Me 2” is rarely laugh out loud funny, but neither was the original, always falling frustratingly short of a rollicking good time.<br /><br />Welcome here are the voice actors, who once again topple expectations for lazy reads by delivering oddball characters and flighty emphasis. Carell is wonderful as Gru, managing his habitual silliness through the glue of a thick accent, which often accentuates the hilarity of his groans and growls. Wiig is a terrific addition to the cast (she actually had a small role in the original picture), matching her co-star with her own spastic behaviors, gifted some vocal honey to balance out the cartoon push of Carell’s characterization. The film’s best scenes feature Gru and Lucy’s developing attraction, with rubbery animation keeping up with the inspired performances, creating a likable pair that naturally feeds into the sequel’s obsession with the ex-supervillain’s disastrous love life.<br />“Despicable Me 2” also sees the return of the popular minions, who blast the screen with gibberish and pratfalls, giggling at fart noises and serve up obscure pop culture references (because kids today can’t get enough Carmen Miranda and “Love Boat” jokes?). They even participate in a few musical numbers to make themselves useful. With their own movie on the way for 2014, it seems strange for “Despicable Me 2” to be so minion-minded, but it’s hard to discount the popularity of the squealing creatures, who once again light up the screen with their goggle-eyed wackiness.<br /><br />Visually “Despicable Me 2” does more than what the film itself can offer with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 2.40:1. A powerful blend of colors assault the senses here, as there is no contrast noise and very little breakdown. Blacks are deep and rich, while brighter colors practically sparkle on the screen. And with an incredibly forceful DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix to announce itself, you barely feel like you’re sitting at home while watching a DVD instead of at the theater. While it’s no big screen blockbuster, “Despicable Me 2” does well for what it offers. No source noise and solid punch from the rear speakers make you feel every ray gun blast and child’s giggle.<br /><br />There’s more than just a missing serum for Gru to combat in “Despicable Me 2.” With Margo going boy crazy, he’s also put into a particularly painful parenthood position, developing the domestic interests of the script. However, big action eventually takes over in the final act, with furious jelly-gun combat supplying visual invention and a refreshing scale to the adventure, inching the sequel past the original in terms of eye candy and climactic creativity. It’s not much of an improvement, but “Despicable Me 2” capably delivers the goods with minimal strain. A solid visual and audio presentation on Blu-ray with some fun special features make for a decent package and certainly worthy entertainment for the kids this holiday season.e are the voice actors, who once again topple expectations for lazy reads by delivering oddball characters and flighty emphasis.

072325804X|5.0|Very charming and enjoyable stories. The illustrations go so well with the stories, perhaps because they are both by Beatrix Potter.
B004TI5N38|1.0|This book was awful...where to start.  The story itself is completely unbelievable...there are so many 1 in a million chance combined in a row just to explain the final plot it was almost comical.  The main character was dry...not bad, but just not a whole lot of human responses to him.  He's a crack investigator who just happens to ignore the most obvious and critical evidence until the very end...I mean really?  And the general stereotypes were just awful...99% of the people who lives in West Virginia must be a dirt poor redneck with 70 IQ and completely miserable, the only good govt official is the CIS investigator, etc.  It has been a while since I've read Baldacci material and his early stuff was good...I hope this isn't representative of his more recent work because it was just comically bad.  In fact,<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />Not to get political, but I was amazed at the level of fantasy Liberal stereotypes that abounded in this book:<br />- 99% of the people in WV are dirt poor, miserable, unhappy, and lucky if they have electricity and running water<br />- Coal bad<br />- There is only one successful businessman who is keeping everyone else poor, and he is a slovenly overweight, arrogant man who doesn't care for anyone but himself<br />- The successful 4* general was a horrible father<br />- Everyone in the military sans the CIS main character had some huge character flaw<br />- The meth dealing motorcycle gang member was really just a misunderstood homosexual that got unwillingly thrown out of the military.<br /> etc...etc..<br /><br />On top of that, I busted out laughing when I read about the super duper enriched radioactive material..and the idea that the govt would send in one untrained CIS investigator with his traitor brother on the phone to save a good chunk of the East Coast was just a bad way to end a bad book (not to mention the amazing coincidence of friends after).<br /><br />Bad.  Really, really bad.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|That sucked so hard. For realz? Are you kidding me? ALL I FRIGGIN’ WANTED TO KNOW WAS WHO LENA ENDED UP WITH!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL. WAS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK!?<br /><br />Before I continue, just a quick recap on my feelings about this series: I liked Delirium. I totally liked Alex. I read Pandemonium. It sucked. I did NOT like Julian. I never believed that Alex was dead. Even though I hated Pandemonium, and Alex was “dead” for most of the book, I was still Team Alex.<br /><br />Okay, so my feelings on this book: If this wasn’t the last book in the series I would probably like this book. BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY QUESTIONS. But this is it. Done. Fin. Nada mas.<br /><br />Before I read Requiem, I actually wasn’t going to finish the series because Pandemonium sort of ruined it for me. All I wanted to know was who Lena ended up with. I also wanted closure from this series so I could stop thinking about it, so I decided to finish the series.<br /><br />So, Requiem. First things first: Will you find out who Lena ends up with? No. Will you find out what happened to Hana? Nah. Will you have all your questions answered? Nope. Will you have closure? HAHAHAHAHAHA, that’s cute, NO.<br /><br />I’m not going to even summarize this book because 1. It’s sorta boring. 2. It doesn’t answer any questions.  3. A summary won’t convince you to read the book.<br /><br />My first complaint. The switching POV, AGAIN. Ugh, I hated it in Pandemonium and I still hate it. It’s told in Lena and Hana’s alternating POV. Uh, what? Hana was never anyone special before why is she all of a sudden a main character?<br /><br />I did like hearing Hana’s story but I had three problems with it: 1. It could have been a completely separate book/novella for the series 2. It only made me ask more questions AND 3. WE NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.<br /><br />Being Team Alex, I rejoiced at the end of Pandemonium when we found out that Alex wasn’t dead. I expected and demanded many adorable moments between Alex and Lena in this book. And guess what. Surprise, surprise, I didn’t get any. In fact Alex was pretty much nonexistent this entire book. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.<br /><br />Not that I expected much after the horrendous plot in Pandemonium, but the plot was lame and I thought the beginning was pretty slow. Eventually it got mildly exciting and action packed towards the end but it still sucked because Alex was MIA and I was yawning through 80% of the book. At least I was able to read it easily. Oliver’s writing is still somewhat good. And I say “somewhat” because there were a few points where she tried waaaaay too hard to make some sort of metaphor to something really artsy. So besides those points, the writing was pretty good and easy to read.<br /><br />Now let me rant about the ending of this book. Literally none of our questions were answered. And in exchange for not getting answers, we got more questions. My entire reason for reading this stupid book was to get freaking answers! But alas, I never got my answers. I might as well never even read the book.<br /><br />Last thing. So funny story, I was reading this book and my older brother walked by and he asked how the book was. I let out a huge sigh and then I explained what had happened. His reaction? “That sounds like poop.” AND IT’S TRUE. THIS IS POOP.many adorable moments between Alex and Lena in this book.

B000OPOAJS|5.0|The combination of Frankenheimer's direction and the varied collection of respected actors make this a thriller to watch repeated, just so you can absorb all the little details that might have been missed on the previous viewing! A car chase aficionado's dream!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|works great, but cant seem to make it come up as a widget, so I have to click on it to get the weather.
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|First - to all readers and reviewers: stop  comparing this book with anything else and using Clancy's name as some marker. This is not Tom Clancy's work, Tom had not written a single book in a decade prior to his untimely passing. His franchise has drawn a dozen start up writers since before 9/11 and the only author who truly improved on Tom's work is Mark Greaney. Yes, Tom set a standard for writing in the 90s and that era has been long gone and that era is where Tom's style belongs.<br /><br />That said, this is Mark Greaney's  work, from start to finish, not \\"with Mark Greaney\\" but Mark Greaney as the author \\"with Tom Clancy franchise\\" - is how it should be stated on the cover. Mark has no need for anyone else's name to be compared with, he is the talent in his own class. The last three novels in the Jack Ryan's series, Locked On, Threat Vector and this one are Mark Greaney's masterpieces not Tom Clancy's - get it all straight.<br /><br />Mark's talent shines in this story as it has been in his own Gray Man series (the 4th one just got released, by the way) Command Authority is written much better than late Clancy could have written it, may he rest in peace. It has less filler, more substance, excellent narrative style, precise and taut logically sound writing, no worthless cliffhangers and no shifting the story from one character to another and then back again  from chapter to chapter, etc.<br /><br />Another Great work by Greaney!
B00632HWOG|1.0|This new version is the worst thing they have done.  I can't wait to change it when I move.  I am only suffering with it for a short time.  If it isn't broke - don't try to fix it.  You didn't succeed.
B00CDTSQZW|2.0|I read a review that said it was good, it really wasn't. Characters and plot never go beyond the ordinary
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|What is not to love about Daniel Craig?  Lots of action as all 007 films; can't wait to see where they go next.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|Obviously, most folks have already seen this who are buying it, so- you already know about the midget cage match and the volcano banana tree. 'Nuff said.
B008Q08EV8|3.0|It was a good action movie. Like many modern movie about this time period there is a female warrior who is the equal of any man. The movie is somewhat antiwar. Neither side is clearly in right.
0785156593|3.0|Good book like the events that are on a large scale and I think it is very useful for people who are trying to understand Thanos.  The seller I bought it from took forever and a day to ship this package though.  I didn't receive the package till 20 days after I ordered it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I had not played Freecell in a long time when this came up as the FAOD. Decided to give it a try and it has been most enjoyable. Works well on my Kindle HDX. Glad I have this game!
B009K45Y62|5.0|Cool case.  Cool cowl.  Great movie.  I like the box that it came in too that was a added bonus even though I didn't keep it.

B00G3Q6VPS|4.0|Britney Jean, the newest album from Britney Spears is being released today, one day after her 32nd birthday. Overall this album has far fewer hits than misses but the good stuff on this album happens to be some of her best work to date.  Strangely the strongest tracks weren't released as the first or second single. Unlike, Femme Fatale, this album features a fair balance between the dance tracks and the mid-tempo/ballads.  While I think Britney's voice is suited for dance backdrops, she sounds surprisingly good on half of the mid-tempo tracks.  The other half are clearly filler and not strong tracks.  The lyrics have gotten significantly deeper than her previous albums and we are seeing a more grown-up Britney.  The lack of promotion for this album is also somewhat startling.  It seems like this album was merely released and used as a promotion vehicle to help kick her two year residency in Vegas which makes sense since live shows are where the money's at for artists nowadays.<br />If you are only going to buy a couple tracks to try the album out, then you should start with:<br />1. Body Ache<br />2. Tik Tik Boom<br />3. Alien<br />Here is a review of the tracks IN ORDER of FAVORITES:<br /><br />1. \\"Body Ache\\" -- This hot electro house edm track reminds me most of \\"Scream & Shout,\\" but even better because there's no will.i.am singing on it.  The track is also reminiscent of 90's hi-nrg euro house.  The best track on the album with her best vocals to date. RELEASE THIS NOW!<br />2. \\"Til It's Gone\\" -- Heavy EDM track that is hard to get out of your head and another vocal stand-out from Ms. Spears. One of her best songs ever!<br />3. Now That I Found You - Great EDM track with a country vibe similar in sound to that Pitbull/Kesha collaboration that's out.  Beautiful lyrics, beautiful vocals.  Great track! This should be on all versions of the album.<br />4. \\"Alien\\" -- William Orbit worked on this awesome mid-tempo opening album track with a highly infectious melody.<br />5. \\"Tik Tik Boom\\" (featuring T.I.) -- Super sexy lyrics against a hip-hop pop-hop backdrop with super catchy chorus to boot.  Ultimately this could have been released by any of today's female singers so expect more from Britney but nonetheless its highly addicting and really needs to be considered as a single release.<br />6. \\"Work B----\\" -- We all know this one.  While I love this track, I am not happy that it was chosen as the first single.  Nonetheless the beat is hot and the video is hotter.<br />7. \\"It Should Be Easy\\" (featuring will.i.am) -- Another will.i.am track where he is heavily featured.  Britney's vocals are heavily vocoded and there is quite a bit of attitude on this hard edm banger.  This will most likely be a single since their last collaboration (Scream and Shout) did so well.<br />8. \\"Passenger\\" -- Katy Perry gets writing credits and Diplo gets production credits on this slower mid-tempo track.<br />9. Don't Cry -- She doesnt sound bad on one of the better ballads on this album.  This one is a grower.<br />10. \\"Perfume\\" -- Sia gets writing credits for this track.  I was expecting much more from a Sia collaboration and these are not my favorite Britney vocals.  Shocked that this was chosen as a single release.  This is sadly headed for flop status.  Would like to move on from this single ASAP.<br />11. \\"Chillin' with You\\" (featuring Jamie Lynn) -- Awkward track on an overall great album.  Clearly, shes trying to help promote her sister with this filler track. Also, her voice is so manipulated on this track, it never sounds like Britney.  Wish there was a version without the sister.<br />12. \\"Brightest Morning\\"/\\"Hold On Tight\\" -- Not impressed with any of these slow jam fillers./>5. \\"Tik Tik Boom\\" (featuring T.I.) -- Super sexy lyrics against a hip-hop pop-hop backdrop with super catchy chorus to boot.

0545626382|5.0|My kids got me hooked now the younger one will have a chance to read further into the story.  Her older sister keeps telling the other to read for the details and she says the movies follow the books we'll.  this order is as advertised ans the shipping was prompt.  Can't wait to read them when she is done!  Very satisfied buyer!
1416979174|4.0|We bought these as wedding favors for the kids at our wedding. The book is SUPER wordy, so the younger kids won't really get it, but they can grow into it. Also, the illustrations are gorgeous. Kids of all ages can enjoy them. The best part is the piece of seed paper in the front. The kids loved that and were so excited to get home and plant them. This was perfect for our GREEN WEDDING!
B002QYNIHU|4.0|I love this to but there is just one tiny problem for me the head is a bit wobbly overall this is a pretty good action figure.

B00GPBZQ3Y|2.0|Wow.<br /><br />And I don't mean that in a good way.<br /><br />Britney's journey from Lolita to EDM Vixen couldn't have been easy, so it made sense to rely on an experienced hands like William Orbit and Will.i.am to help shoulder the burden, especially after the success of Scream & Shout.  This cd could well be pop-art; it's literally all over the place and leaves you wondering what the heck's it supposed to be.  No \\"song\\" has more than two verses to it and the rest is all filler: Will.i.am's endlessly looped hooks while throwing a Phil Spector-ish wall of Autotuned (noise) sound at you to try and distract you.  The beats and rhythms are decent overall, but the constant repetition of the hooks in each song keep reminding you of what's missing... and the cd's already short enough as it is.  Plus a lot of the effects and synths sound like they got lifted from a Sega Genesis or SNES game.  The deluxe version's bonus tracks are lame and the explicit version literally only has a couple of curse words in it; aside from Work B***h there's a couple of lines about T&A in Tik Tik Boom.  That's it.  Seriously.<br /><br />Some highlights: *= deluxe edition bonus track<br /><br />Alien: a decent song to start things off with, it's not a stretch to say that lyrically it comes across like a metaphorical capsule for her personal life and career:<br />\\"There was a time I was one of a kind/Lost in the world out of me myself and I<br />Was lonely then, like an alien<br />I tried but I never figured it out/Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd<br />Ooh that was then, like an alien<br /><br />...Had to get used to the world I was on/While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong...\\"<br /><br />Work B***h: we already know this one.  A great club track that's the lone standout on the whole album.  And that's a shame.<br /><br />Perfume: a lament about wondering what your man is doing while visiting his ex; at first blush it almost doesn't even sound like her singing, you're so used to all the filtering and Auto-tuning... at least not until you get to the chorus.<br /><br />It Should Be Easy: Surprise!- an overproduced collision of noise from Will.i.am.  Skip it.<br /><br />Tik Tik Boom (with T.I.): sounds like someone was playing Sonic the Hedgehog while doing the music for this one.  Adding a playa like T.I. to the mix means it's all about one thing.  Not bad.<br /><br />Body Ache: flipped the springing synth from Scream & Shout to form the base for it, but it never goes much beyond that.  And it took NINE people to write this dud.<br /><br />Til It's Gone: ok, what the heck is with the chorus- did someone unlock a secret level on Megaman?  No better example of a nothing track than this one right here.  Childish.<br /><br />Passenger: the writing from Katy Perry shows, as it's one of the few that even attempts any kind of lyrical depth, being about giving up control and trusting in the one you're with.  Too bad all the 8-bit video game stuff tossed in means the music doesn't match up.<br /><br />Chillin' With You (feat. Jamie Lynn): little sister joins the proceedings for an easy one about just being with a friend, someone you can relax with- even with Autotunes.  Even has some actual guitar strumming for a few moments.  I do like how the southern accent was left in (\\"chillin' wit' choo!\\")<br /><br />*Brightest Morning Star: co-written by Sia, this one's dedicated to her children.  Light, airy and easy.<br /><br />*Now That I Found You: another slice of wtf-ery with the music.  Swear this sounds like an EDM hoe-down or something.<br /><br />*Perfume (The Dreaming Mix): unnecessary and uninteresting...  and it's actually a couple of seconds longer.  Can't even muster up anything else to say about it.<br /><br />If all this sounds overly critical, it's because this deserves it.  A Britney Spears album is supposed to be fun, almost in a dumb blonde kind of way- like in on the joke.  This is just kind of dumb.<br /><br />No, not kind of.ed to all the filtering and Auto-tuning... at least not until you get to the chorus.<br /><br />It Should Be Easy: Surprise!- an overproduced collision of noise from Will.i.am.

B00GIZO674|4.0|This game is so cool.  It is really fun and helps pass the time.  Keeps your mind working.  I can't stop playing it.
B0029VUV70|4.0|Absolutely outstanding acting performances by all.  It was very well directed with interesting set design.  Not a happy, upbeat movie, but very well done.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Been using the free cell that had the ads~don't miss them a bit! Little harder to get my bad eyes to  adjust to the differences, but love it anyway, and I'm sure they will adjust!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie has great acting, it's well directed, the clothing is interesting and the drama keeps you watching.  Can't wait to see the second one.
B007UZO3F6|2.0|It is defective and am waiting for a RMA to send it to shuttle for repair. I think it has a bad motherboard as it just turns off every 2 to 10 minutes corrupting windows every time.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Fun game. Very good functionality and ease of use. Just need to add more levels now and then you will get longer entertainment
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is absolutely the best Christmas album you will ever hear! I could listen to it over & over, all day long! You will love it!
B005FPT51K|5.0|I use it as a burglar alarm for my condo a hundred miles from home.  For the freezing problem, I put a Xmas light timer on it and automatically power cycle twice a day. It hasn't froze since. I bet they have an undiagnosed memory leak.  The best features are enabled via the  I.E. browser.  Motion and sound alerts with snapshots go to my mobile email and FTP server.  If a robbery occurs, I automatically have two sets of pics off-site!  You can even trigger it with some smoke detectors.<br />The documentation to activate this stuff is really lacking, which accounts for most all the bad reviews.  Us fans should write something for them to encourage their sales and promote future innovation.
B001BANK32|5.0|I have owned this book for years but after seeing the movie (and loving it) I didn't think I needed to. I heard there was another book - a continuance of the book. So I finally read it. It was amazing! Somethings were the same and alot was different but I loved both. Definitely a great book!!
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|I love reading David Baldacci's books.  He has a gift for character development and for building suspense.  I wish that this story would have ended a bit more fully.  What happened to Sam, Tyler, and Kathy?<br /><br />My only other question, as always, is:  When is the next King and Maxwell book coming out?<br /><br />Thanks for a great read!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device and easy to use.  The google play option is nice with the first 3 months free.  The product is well built and thought out for most streaming uses.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The best show ever. I had pre-ordered this, and received it the day it came out. It was not packaged well; the plastic it was in was cracked, the apron was missing, the chip was missing, and the bonus disk was loose because the clip to hold it was broken. I e-mailed Amazon, and they responded in 15 minutes, mailed me a new one that day which I received the very next day, in absolutely perfect condition.  Well worth the money. Thank you, Amazon, for such excellent customer service.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of my daughter and cousin's favorite alblums. She enjoyed both giving it and receiving it last christmas
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Great fun. Love all the versions of this game. The only real difference from Free Flow is the neon lights.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I play a lot of these type games on my tablet.  Some are better than others.  This is one of the better ones, in my opinion. The games available for tablets do not compare to regular computer games but they are still fun to play.  I enjoyed Stray Souls: Dollhouse Story.  I like the game itself.  I liked the story.  I would definitely recommend this game.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Every moment of The Goldfinch is ripe with the very stuff of life: beauty, pain, chaos, and love. Wonderfully crafted and impossible to put down.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Interesting story however I am a bit skeptical that the US govt would allow the real truth to come out from one of its soldiers. It was a good try though
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I grew up with Oregon trail and this is a wonderful game, cute graphics. I like that you have to figure out how to do things like nurse settlers back to health or buildings.<br />although the text game had the settlers on a path, wheras this has the settler in one spot.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|this game takes forever to download and once it finishes it turns out that I don't have enough room.  lizard pee is good soap
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This was nothing like the book so don't expect a comparison, but it was a pretty good movie. My husband and I liked it.
B00E8S2KV2|3.0|in my opinion, the special effects  and sets are overdone at the expense of the characters and plot.  One of the editors of LOTR said that sometimes, less is better.  That applies to this movie.<br />The Bilbo in this movie is boring with very little personality.  Ian Holm has set a high standard for this role.  Martin Freeman is just not Bilbo, even a young Bilbo.<br />Have you seen a miniature horse?  Do you know why a miniature horse is not a pony?  It's because a miniature horse has the same proportions as a horse, not a pony.  Why is this important?  The dwarfs in The Hobbit are miniature men.  Gimli was a dwarf.  These dwarfs are dwarfs in name only.  This tactic probably lowered the cost of making this movie but at the cost of looking authentic.<br />If this was a stand alone movie, I probably would have given it a higher rating.  But it follows the masterpiece of LOTR and doesn't approach the quality of that trilogy.  LOTR (all three films)  is about as perfect a movie that can be made.<br />So enjoy The Hobbit for what it is, not for what it should and could have been.  I hope the sequels are not as extravagant and overdone as in this film.  I would much rather have seen Peter Jackson focus on the characters and plot instead of  having them compete with the special effects.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|use thisnalmost everyday with my galaxy s3 fast and works this is such a great product its awsome hahabuy it
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Does what it says it will but could have been more durable. It feels like the cover will break right off. It hasn't yet so why am I complaining?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's is a fun game but the game is hard. This is why it is a good game to play<br />1 you get to run with any character you want to<br />2 you collect coins and by cool stuff<br />3 it has good graphics<br />This is why it is hard<br />1 when ever you hit something the cop with his dog is behind you<br />2 there are a lot of obstacles<br />3 when you hit something twice the cop gets you and the dog starts barking<br />But you should try it<br />:- )
B000HWZ4A2|3.0|It is difficult to cram the contents of a great novel into a short movie, but I thought there could have been more time spent on character development.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is so cute and fun I play it everyday  it is a very easy game but I think  u should try it<br />The game is a good game for kids
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|Great material but didn't enjoy the  instant repeat of info I would have liked a more condensed version good info tho
B0091XHI0W|4.0|Great movie, very funny and good to see Jim back at it being naturally funny... No over the top falls or stupid faces to being laughs, just great comedy and a good story too...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this app. Always works great for me and I can't seem to put it down. Played on previous tablet and had issues with crashing after level 30. Hopefully won't have same problem here.
B00FPGV3RS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, story was well  written for a movie of this genre... Made me laugh and the special affects were. Good.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Love the movie. The dark parts of the movie were much clearer. Lots of special features. The first two movies are the best.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Other than the dialog between puzzles running quite long at times, this is a well done game with a number of hours of play to it. It is challenging without being overly difficult. The story is fun, too, in s[ite of excessive dialog at points.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game. The horses and people look a lot like the real thing. The goals are fun and u get gems all throughout the game. U aren't pressured into buying gems... I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Jake Brigance pulled it out in A Time to Kill and won a huge case.  Now it's three years later and a new case unexpectedly lands into his lap.  John Grisham does not disappoint in this book either.  I just wish that he would do more stories with Jake in the leading role.<br /><br />I do not like the fact that relatives fight over everything in real life and in books.  He knew what he was doing when he wrote that new will.  It wasn't looking good for Lettie either.  All of those people that lived off of her are nothing more than leaches.<br /><br />I had to giggle sometimes over all of the lawyers antics though.  It was also interesting to note in the story what has happened to everyone in the three years since A Time to Kill was published and made into a movie.<br /><br />I didn't think that Jake would pull this one out of the fire either.  But Lucian came to bat for him and the ending was stunning.  Not giving anything away, but you could envision what happened so very long ago and Seth gave what he did to Lettie.  The jury came back with the right verdict and the only verdict to make everyone happy.<br /><br />This would make a great movie.  I can already picture some of the scenes in it.  Only time will tell.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So much has potential. But it doesn't do anything that my TV doesn't. Unless they start allowing mirroring from your phone or allow more video or at least pics from your phone then it is useless. Google, please work on this!
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Fun way to spend some idle time and the kids enjoy it too! Nice little app for my Kindle Fire.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed...to return to see how Jake and his family were doing after the first book was a wonderful way to finish his story.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|This tour was amazing (I think it's better than the last one) and the Blu-Ray shows it. I can't stop enjoying it :)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I am hooked. Cool graphics. Will recommend to my friends. Just wish it would sync with my phone. Happy Hunting
B007HJ9NBE|4.0|Was a good movie. I thought it was just as good as the original one. I would recommend this movie.
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|This is a five-star movie, my favorite of all the versions that have been released to date. The stars are true greats, and the music is evocative and haunting. The reason I could not award the 5 stars is that the print is awful -- dark and full of lines. I was glad to be able to rent it through Prime because I had been wanting to see it again, but I am also glad I did not purchase it because the video quality, even though \\"digitally remastered,\\" is poor.
B00F031XPS|3.0|Overall notbad but not worth the price tag paid...Said that, it is true that is a nice documentary of the life of this muscial genius, but honestly I would be more interested in the very scarse and not so easy to find material, unfortunatelly for us there is only bits a pieces, here and there, and the only two main attractions are the extras, five songs in one performance and about four or five of the other, and one full song of the Love and Peace Festival, the rest is just bits and pieces and some of the coments are already released on other videos, IIRC there is another documentry of Hendrix that I had long time ago in VHS, and an official release, that had a lot more information, interviews with friends, and some of the same of this one, along with one performance of Buddy Miles...Sorry just the apereance of the little greedy sister, talking of things that probably she do not even remember, ruined the night for me...
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|Music is nice, and there is plenty going on to keep you interested. I had to use the hint button a few times to figure out what to do.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My grandchildren have so much fun with this game and all the Dr. Panda Apps.  Easy to follow for toddlers and preschool kids.
B0007939NO|5.0|wonderful movie, would have loved more extras, but hey, it's an older movie….good stuff.  You'll find yourself wanting to visit over and over again.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is awesome!!!! I love this show, the first season was just as good and so is coven!! Love love love this show
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I fell in love with The Piano Guys first on You Tube and them on PBS.  When I saw them in concert and saw they are fun loving, down to earth guys that have incredible talent I knew I would love them forever.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|BEST ALBUM THIS SEASON. ORGASMS IN MY EARS EXCEPT I'm not a big fan of dope track. This is a head banger album.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Inspirational music to get you through the worse of times and the best.  A mix of calming and exciting sounds.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game to pass time with. Needs more activities to do but graphics are cute. Like that can be customized and things can be bought.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|The Piano Guys Christmas album is just the thing to get you into the holiday spirit.  You'll be humming along in no time.
B003KGBIRK|2.0|80's &#34;cult&#34; crap...  James Woods is a HORRIBLE actor, decent idea gone horribly, horribly wrong.  How this made it into the criterion collection is beyond me!????
0452295548|5.0|I loved the book. It should be read by everyone who works in the medical profession. It gives you a unique perspective: from the patient, in this case someone who is highly qualified to write about the subject.
B004C00EM8|5.0|This film shook me to my very core.  The last time I was so disturbed by a movie, I was 8 years old, and had just finished the Exorcist.  Ever since then, I have been searching all over the world for a film that could aspire to do the same.  My search is over.  If you want to be genuinely scared by a movie, this is the one for you.  PLEEEEEASE do not skip because it is dubbed over in English, shame on you if you do.
B000IKWBC2|4.0|Well I like them, they fit good and sound pretty good. But I wouldn't call them &#34;HD&#34; or &#34;DJ headphones&#34; I wouldn't ever use these as a DJ. They do work good for garage producers being as they are so cheap. But I have had better headphones for about the same price from goodwill.. lol. But it's worth the buy.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Compliments my HP ENVY 4504 e-All-in-One Printer very well I feel I have the features of the higher end models using this app.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great collection--it has all 8 films as described, and I like how they are all placed in one convenient case. If I have to purchase it again once I burn this one out, I'll gladly do so! :)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I can't bealive how great this game is.I can't bealive I didn't get the game before now.I'm so stupip because I didn't get the game before now.I spent time playing other games than getting the deere hunting game.I should be ashamed that I didn't get the game until now.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoyed this game played as a child with a deck of cards on a rainy day. The atmosphere of your graphics is enjoyable and really gets you into the card playing mood.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Loved this book! I am a big fan of Presidential history and really enjoyed seeing the dynamics of the relationships between them. The relationship between the Bushes and Clinton surprised me the most. I would recommend it wholeheartedly!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is the best and easiest &#34;read&#34; on the subject of gluten issues I have ever read. Very informative and clearly written.
B0099114WO|5.0|Good movie,  it is a gift and am sure she will love it as much as I do, or I hope so
B008ASGP3U|5.0|more mystery than his other books, very well outlined and organized, I liked it very much, have read the whole series and this is a very fine work
B00BYCT3T2|1.0|NO Surround  option! Pcm 2.0, Dts HD 2.0, and dolby true 2.0. What? Inside liner notes say &#34; Where possible tracks will be available in 5.1 surround, but in order to pay respect to the original material this is not possible for every release.&#34; How about stating which one's are then. Also, have they ever heard of Eliot Scheiner or Steven Wilson's excellent reissues. Is this just another -Money Grabber?
B00CATSONE|3.0|The writing about Tesla is dry and sounds like it comes straight out of a text book. It is used as a vehicle for illustrating (poorly) the author's view about genius and creativity. The only reason I'm ranking it as high as I am is because I didn't know much of anything about Tesla and after reading this I am curious to learn more about him and his life.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|the pacing is kind of weird because it jerks you around between intense action and  comedy but if you are a fan of Peter Jackson directing you won't be upset. Never has there been a better movie about this popular children's tale
B00CHILW64|5.0|This is just a great movie! Naomi and Ewan are wonderful and it was directed right. I thoroughly enjoyed the film!
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is a collaborative album that is a detachment from the regular daft punk experience, but still very a great CD to listen to repeatedly.
B00D6DVSAE|3.0|I absolutely love his music. This album, although good, is not quite what I expected. It seems rather self indulgent. It's more folk music than what he usually does.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I found it addressed gaps of American history that relate to the true struggles of America's former enslaved population and their descendants.  Also, how some white families have been affected by knowledge of the inhumane treatment of fellow human beings.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I love this CD!!!! I've been a Stevie Wonder fan forever but, the last time I purchased his music, it was on vinyl. So, I got the CD and it's become a favorite!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Not so challenging. Funny. Much cleaner than real hunting, but not nearly as challenging nor invigorating nor life affirming. Makes me hungry.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a great little app! It shows, in various formats. the networks available and their signal strength. While traveling, I have referred to this many times.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This author reached an incredible level of understanding AND WRITING about how a young man with Autism (or some other similar condition), plus being a savant thinks.  It is an eyeopener for all of those who want to understand this condition.
B001GJ9G90|5.0|I love this movie! The characters are great and it's wonderful to see Brad and Angie interact so well together.
B007SGM084|5.0|The erotic sex is interesting enough, but the author's ability to create such believable characters is the real jewel in this series.  Interestingly, the trilogy begins to lose a bit of its interest as one reads through the third part of the trilogy.  Nevertheless, only someone who is a real prude would not enjoy these books.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I love Jesse Cook and this set doesn't disappoint! He's just a great guitarist and the music is wonderful! It's varied and it's just great!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is the album to purchase and listen to again and again!  Innovative yet familiar arrangements will bless your soul and lift your spirits!
B0041B4B8G|5.0|Who are the people here that don't like this movie?  No sense of humor whatsoever.  Funny from start to finish and quotable lines for decades to come.....&#34;You are a smelly pirate hooker. Why don’t you go back to your home on Whore Island?”
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I liked this movie. I would have said I loved it but on certain tvs you can not see all the little things that make the movie more scary. It let me with questions that i don't feel the movie answered also sometimes the music I felt overwhelmed the parts where you were supposed to jump or be startled it distracted from the scary.<br />  I did find the movie unsettling and scary. the village and the strangness of  the villagers. the cold and damp. Where the house was located and the isolation.<br />  A good movie that I will watch again.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I love Michael Buble.....I feel he sings these songs just to me......they are beautifully recorded.....He sings so much like Frank Sinatra, very mellow and full of feeling....
039916409X|5.0|On my first read through, I skimmed and did not concentrate on doing much of the actual tapping. But very quickly, I had a week where several big and unexpected money &#34;miracles&#34; happened for me. At first, I didn't put the two things together but nothing else had changed.  So, I have picked it up a second time and am doing the exercises as well as the tapping videos. I thought the material was easy to understand, the principles make sense, and I, quite unexpectedly, got quick results. I have also had good results with tapping in other areas of my life. I'm excited to have this book to guide me through the process focusing on money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so detailed I was truly surprised. Your whole family will enjoy taking care of these beautiful creatures.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So surprised at free game w attainable goals. Most u get stuck and than get bored. Not this one. And love that can trade for money so can cont. Further game play. Amazing game
B00190OHD6|5.0|Great movie great price it's one of my favorites glad I found it here for such a great great price
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I stumbled across this book from various reviewers talking about the second book, Wayward. The overall plot sounded interesting so I thought I would try out the nifty Prime lending feature and I borrowed this book (not sure how that works… but it is cool). First off what initially attracted me to this book is the puzzle setup. A man wakes up in the woods, can’t remember who he is and it seems like the whole town is in a conspiracy against him. Neat!<br /><br />This book definitely is smart with its pacing, action and dialogue but where it started to lose me was towards the ending. I think the author did his job too well in setting up a plausible ending to what starts out bizarre and almost paranormal. I was not surprised at all where it ended up and was kind of let down by some of the conclusions. These disappointments are more of me being a science fiction geek who starts to break down the little itty bitty details that really aren’t all that important.<br /><br />The characters in this book are decent and well written. They have pasts that help mold their actions in the present and Ethan’s past definitely shows how he is able to survive and reach to the bizarre world around him and even survive. The first half of the book is more of a puzzle but the second half could be summed up as a chase sequence. This is one of those books where I am not really sure what theme the author was trying for. It doesn’t really seem to be about gilded societies covering up a dark core of humanity although that is present, it really wasn’t that big of an issue as the overall puzzle reveal kind of changes, well everything. I guess the theme could be something related to the ending and the reason for the town but that seems rather disappointing.<br /><br />In the end this book kept me up far too late as I leapt from page to page rushing to see the conclusion. Even if I found the conclusion disappointing the overall experience was a fantastic ride.<br /><br />Verdict: Recommendednded
B0063IH60K|4.0|Classic card game in digital form.  Wonderful diversion.  Several varieties available, including &#34;random&#34;, &#34;win&#34;, &#34;re-deal&#34;, as well as replay a move.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Finally a calendar that does everything I need for both phone and tablet.  My only complaint is that does &#34;require&#34; user to be logged into the amazon app store. It is very annoying to be periodically thrown to that sign in screen while trying to simply view an appointment.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The Candy Crush Saga is a nice diversion.  I have only mastered 8 of 400 levels, so I am still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't.  The popups asking for the purchase of information to reach higher levels is annoying, but that is the way with &#34;free&#34; aps.
1452126607|5.0|It is exactly what I expected.  This calendar is very cute and hilarious.  Love it.  It is everything it said it is.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This is one of the most boring, inane stories I have read in a long time.  Is any of the time spent on the boat real?  Or is it all an allegory for something?  And what about all the time spent talking about various religious experiences?  Any point there?  Maybe some will find it stimulating, but I did not.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|We need an update! I just updated and I am still at 440 when they have 485 levels. I love playing on my kindle but the updates are slow. I love candy crush.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Every time you try to play this on my son's kindle fire HD, it flips upside down!! Pretty much useless that way!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love puzzles and find this to be very thought provoking and really makes you have to think. It's one of the best puzzles I've played. Helps me to remember that every seeming impossible situation has a solution. :-)
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Super fun. I am LV.53 I will be hosting green dragons on server North America. Look for me and I will help with Lv s . When you see me press block 3 times rapidly.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does exactly what it is suppose to do. I use it to tabcast from my computer and plan on getting rid of the satellite bill.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't care for it. I don't get it . So what's the big deal?<br />Tell me what I missing I just don't get it
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This was a very, very, very fun game!!!  Loved the cute pirate parrot.  The jewels are nice and glittery.  Makes the game that much more fun to play! Recommend to all ages!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I just got this over the weekend; my husband has it on his tablet and suggested it for my Kindle as my Kindle kept hanging up.  It freed up quite a bit of space and was very easy to use.  However, the Kindle still has a tendency to hang up and I think it is a software problem with the Kindle.  If your Kindle gobbles up a ton of space, try this.  I got it for free at the Apps Store.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This is a really super production. The characters are so interesting and mysterious, and the final episode will surprise even the most canny of mystery fans. Could a second season possibly be as interesting?
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is a very exciting book. I loved getting to know the characters and learning about the world they live in. Anyone who likes fantasy will love this story. There are many interesting plot turns and creative ideas in this book.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake Shelton is my favorite country western singer. I watch him on the voice and really like him. Great singer with a great personality.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Very clear and concise writing makes for easy reading. This book was very informative and will give the reader much to think about, while at the same time offering a new perspective on why people are successful. And if you think it's ONLY hard work and effort, you might be wrong!
B0098460O4|5.0|I just love this cd.  Beautiful singing by two young singers. Hope they do very well in the coming years.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|The best James Bond ever. Action, story, film sets are all top notch. Daniel Craig is at the top of his game.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|This was entertaining. Just OK. Story seemed to drag at spots. I was hoping for more than it turned out to be.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is an amazing 2d game but there's a very annoying glitch in the back pack menu were a few slots will lock and prevent you from moving it please fix this. But above all its an amazing game.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Has held  me captivated for almost three evenings in a row !  Would highly recommend it for teens on up to elders.
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|Love, love, love this soundtrack! I love Idina Menzel and Disney so this was absolutely perfect for me and &#34;Let it go!&#34; has been on repeat since it arrived. The other songs took a few listens to start to like them and I liked them even more once I saw the movie and saw the songs in context. This soundtrack definitely has a Broadway quality to it and Idina's vocals are wonderful and full of emotion.<br /><br />&#34;Do you want to build a snowman?&#34; and &#34;For the First Time in Forever&#34; quickly became favorites for me. If you are a fan of Disney or Idina, this is a must have!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I love this app! The characters are colorful and fun. The games are easy to access and come loaded with great music and kids love it when I turned this app on, they all surrounded me wanting to play next. The games are age appropriate and kids love to play them. The kids I work with stayed engaged and got really excited while playing the games. Research has shown that children learn better when they are engaged in fun activities. This app delivers a fun way to learn for any young child. I would recommend this app to any parent wanting to teach there child at home. I would also recommend this app to be used with professionals working with children.
B00DBISUWS|3.0|Vocals and musicians and excellent.  Song-writing leaves much to be desired.  Someone bring them a new member who can write songs, please.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|I actually chose this as a Christmas gift for a child that I do not know.  However, I was advised that this 9 year-old boy liked &#34;action figures&#34; or &#34;anything angry birds&#34;.  As a mother, I fear we somehow deaden a child's imagination with some of our toys, and I'm not in favor of war toys.  I felt this would be a very active, imaginative game agent for this child, and I hope he enjoys it for a long time.
0743270754|5.0|Having read most available books on Lincoln and the Civil War era, this one tackles a  subject matter that has never been addressed before in such depth.  It ushers one through the complexities of negotiations with a Lincoln cabinet stocked with varied opinions and priorities. It shows the reader the genius strategy Lincoln had for surrounding himself with people who privided ever angle on any given issue thus enabling him to make vital decisions with as much pro and con information as possible.  Never a smooth process with several rivalries and underhandedness involved, it is very fascinating to have this inner view of the thought processes responsible for decision-making by a president and his cabinet  during a vital and crisis-filled time in history.  Excellent!
B003F5NSTW|4.0|I really enjoyed the story, I just found it a touch unbelievable that somebody would write letters using such complex language.  But it is a must read as far as I am concerned
B0002HWO8C|5.0|Awesome Smurf; great quality, and very bright. Nephew loved it immediately. Looking to purchase more to add to his collection.
B000QE9ERK|2.0|Too predictable. .....<br />they all go to hell....<br />just looking for false power to make themselves into a false god.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game a lot.  Just wish you could collect coins for power ups faster.  Played on a plane and the guy next to me had to get it too
B009C7JS14|5.0|I loved this Weather App.  It told me today's weather's forecast.  It told me that it was so sunny out today.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|For this - the sum is actually less than the parts.  It's got all the pieces - good actors, intriguing storyline, & nicely shot. I can't quite decide where it fails - its as if it spends too much time on the conflict within Superman yet doesn't really hit the nail on the head. If that makes any sense.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive,and very fun to play. So many levels and so little moves in each boards. It is so much fun.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The movie is one I will never forget. I remember the first time I saw it I sat stunned for nearly 30 minutes. It really gives you an example of what Jesus went through just because He loves mankind so much. Also it showed the love and anguish His mother went through. This is not an easy movie to watch, but it is very important to see it if you happen to believe in Christianity and if one doesn't believe you should see what Jesus did for you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It helps a lot with all my other apps and with my real life when it comes to spending my money
B008602KQI|4.0|I had first thoughts that this would be a film for the younger set, but I found it most entertaining. Jennifer Lawrence is a very talented actress, and the story line was very enthralling.
1452662002|2.0|The book is tedious, and the audio version was difficult to understand.  The reader's voice was often lowered while talking.  A better recommendation would be &#34;Citizens of London,&#34; by the same author.
1476715904|5.0|This book was like listening to a friend tell a story that you had to hear more about. Well written, thought provoking, funny & sad! I immediately downloaded the sequel to it, which is every bit as good, if not better! Fabulous author/storyteller!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down very entertaining characters. Loved the amusing main character; Ana. Ana, thought like most women think, plus I loved her sense of humor.
B001OKCT2M|5.0|one Stallone's finest . . . a realistic look at the future and what of American culture will survive . . .
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Of course there's going to be negative reviews and spoilers, which really isn't something I enjoy doing so if this book is something you're thinking about try a sample and go from there. but I do believe that to put words together in such a lovely and loving manner this is what words were meant for.
B00EM764ZC|3.0|I was hoping for an easy trip planner, but this one takes some time to fathom the instructions.  I am used to MS Streets & Trips which i use with a GPS - this one can't quite compare to S&T.
B009XTF8KQ|2.0|So so boring and predictable that I didn't even mind that Silverlight fatally failed with 20 minutes to go and refused to finish streaming the movie. Or perhaps the plugin failure was an editorial comment from my computer.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It is the scenes you mentally picture from her marvelous use of detailed descriptions.  The feelings of the child left to figure how his life changed but too young to understand those changes.  Characters so perfectly described as possible visitors in your home or someone you once knew.  Relationships new and gone from this lonely child.  Totally absorbing read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Could not put it down. I'm addicted to the story line. Very colorful characters and a pretty entreating plot. Several twists and unexpected scenarios. Can't wait for the next volume to come out for the rest of the story. Was tragic to find out the story left us with cliff-hangers.
B00CWVFVUE|5.0|This is a great movie.  The books are really good too.  I can't wait for the others to come out in movie too. It's a great follow up to the Twilight movies, utilizing witches instead of vampires.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Great read!  I've changed my way of eating since reading this.  Got rid of the perpetual brain fog and am feeling better physically than I have in years.
0425267695|5.0|This book was awesome. Well worth the money. Great for a reader who is hard to please--you won't be disappointed with this one.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Buy this book. Do the work. It will change your life if you let it. I've read a lot of other books on the subject and this is the first one that can get me past myself.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the LOTR trilogy and this is just as good. It's only Part I though, which I didn't realize at the time. It still gets five stars because it was so good I was NOT disappointed that there's More to Come!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|King did a good job tying up loose ends and questions from the shining. This book wasn't just a remake of the shining it was a whole new story with some characters that I knew and got to know<br />better along with some new interesting ones. Definitely one of the best books I have read of late. Bravo Stephen bravo.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|I liked Shrek and Shrek 2. They were fun, they were silly, I lived with my daughter and grandkids and we all enjoyed them repeatedly. But this one - I've been waiting for this a long time. Absolutely as great as I thought it would be. The cat stole the show before, now he's the star. That's all you need to know. Seriously. Corny funny crazy animated movie with massive cat humor - the dance sequences had me roaring out loud. Oh yes. Cats do have Dance Fights. It gets crazy. They're cats. What can I say! Well done! Cat lovers will have an extra layer of delight in this one, because the creators really do know cats! Also check out that little short &#34;Three Diablos&#34; since that finally got me to go ahead and buy it!
B007N85POS|4.0|Great visuals and sound effects.  I'm just as addicted to Rio as I was to the original.....My husband probably wishes I never found it tho......
0783225857|5.0|An excellent film with an extraordinary actor. This is worth owning. We have watched it several times and it always has a little tid bit new. .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book I am relieved. How horrible but we'll written. I loved it and hated it. Definitely thought provoking.
0439023513|1.0|I WAS SENT THE WRONG BOOK WITH THE MOCKINGJAY COVER AND DIDN'T REALIZE IT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I WAS SO UPSET WHEN I REALIZED THIS.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved it (as most reviews suggested I would) until about 2/3 of the way through.  Then it just got repetitive, I got bored, and the ending to me wasn't believable.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|You get what you pay for with this product. It's VERY good in streaming to your TV, however... It only works with a hand full of apps at this time. Here is a list of apps this device works with as of 12-3-13. YouTube app, YouTube.com, Netflix app, Netflix.com, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, Hulu Plus, Pandora and HBOGo. Google is going to allow 4rd party apps to this this device later on in 2014.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Fun action film with a good message about doing what is right. Fast action, great graphics, interesting dialogue. Worth seeing.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Amazing book. Life changing. It's well worth the money, I will read again. Author does an amazing job. Great read.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I can listen to and enjoy all of the tracks. This group is very good!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited until the second book was released as a movie before reading the series. This was a FAST read and so much more detailed than the movie. But books are always going to be better than the movie adaptation.
B00G70JQZC|4.0|If you watch the movie for nothing else but Hugh Jackman, you won't be disappointed. He makes a GREAT Wolverine. A few \\"wow\\" moments; a super hero that is shown to be vulnerable and a decent story line makes this movie a must see for action/fantasy fans. My gripe is that the story could have been relayed a little better. There were alot of new characters introduced that were very intriguing but by the end of the movie, I was indifferent about all of them due to the lack of their development. If they cut out some of the PG13 kung-fu-like fighting scenes and instead focused on story telling and character development, I would have given it 5 stars. The Japanese background of Wolverine's past is the premise of the story line.
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|excelent extras,nice packaging. A classic recording. Its nice to hear the alternate takes and studio banter. One of my favorite albums
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This one is just as good as the first one!  Can't wait for the third.  Hope there are several more.
034547581X|4.0|Saw the movie and later, during a vacation trip to Florida,  met a Viet Nam Veteran who strongly recommended to read the book to have a deeper view of what happened during the battle of Ia Drang.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|bought it as a gift  for a family member,they loved it.<br />that's all i have to say about the Movie.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love it! Such amazing music and talent! My new favorite Christmas album to play! The Piano Guys are simply THE BEST! I love everything they do!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have tried and tried and tried again but no matter how many times ill try this app will refuse to download on my kindle while saying &quot;vtube is tunable it be installed&quot; si all I have to say ti that is &quot;BOOOOOOO&quot;
B00FOWX6NM|2.0|This case is not what it appears to be. When I received it, the clear plastic was all scratched up and blurry. If you need a clear case, do not buy this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great app they just need to update it more because there are other versions that are way more advanced
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! so does my whole family...... it's just so fun! I have over 1 million coins! unbelievable right, well believe it! lol.....
B004XDYJRU|4.0|sometimes it disconnects/drops what i am listening to, even when I have full bars. very good selection of stations, although from time to time, a station will be listed, but then it tunes to something else that is on same or close to same frequency/station number that I am trying to get to
B00F6YC78I|5.0|Its Castle........its great.  There is not much you can say.  It shipped promptly and I have added it to my collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so much like me taking care a real horse!This game is very fun interactive. I love it!! It is defiantly worth downloading.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|guys i like this game much, but cant connect to facebook can you help me please. just want to access all features
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game! It brings back so many fond memories of games like Mist, etc. Beautifully done with fun puzzles and nice background music. They only issue I have it that that's is over too soon! Looking forward to The Room Two. Well worth the price.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been using a couple of weeks and so far it works great. (Much better than Obama Care app is working)
0142412023|5.0|Fantastic young adult novel, John Green is a great writer. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as i have all of John's novels.
B002KKCVX2|5.0|Had old pair of Teva sandals with one sole starting to detach. Needed new pair of the same size. These Tanza's work like a treat. Only been wearing them for a short time, but gradually getting the fit right. With the three separate adjustments you can't go wrong.
B00G4I6DQM|5.0|Anyone who's ever been to SeaWorld MUST SEE THIS DOCUMENTARY.  I was moved and shocked, and I hope that this movie will help close down all marine parks.  Unlike the lies that SeaWorld tells at their shows and in their commercials, these &#34;tricks&#34; that they force the whales to perform are not &#34;what the animals do in the wild&#34;; when not on display for an audience these animals are kept in deplorable conditions.  The tricks are taught by withholding food from the whales if they don't perform as instructed-NO ONE SHOULD EVER PAY ADMISSION AT A MARINE WATER PARK AGAIN.
B000002KCC|5.0|Another one of Neil Young's 4 &#34;must own&#34; Albums alongside &#34;Ragged Glory&#34;, &#34;On The Beach&#34;, & &#34;Zuma.&#34; On the other hand, pretty much all Neil Young Albums are &#34;must owns&#34; though, right…lol? Add &#34;After The Goldrush&#34; while you're at it!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|One of the best films ever made - in my opinion.  Long but worth every minute.  Spectacular photography and amazing story.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Another one of Neil Young's 4 &#34;must own&#34; Albums alongside &#34;Ragged Glory&#34;, &#34;Tonight's The Night&#34;, & &#34;Zuma.&#34; On the other hand, pretty much all Neil Young Albums are &#34;must owns&#34; though, right…lol? Add &#34;After The Goldrush&#34; while you're at it!
0553582011|5.0|I love this book because GRRM finally started bringing the story back together in preparation for a final conclusion. All the characters are finally making their way back to Westeros for what will hopefully be an epic ending one day.

B003B02O0A|5.0|Read Sycamore Row first, Grisham's most recent - then  Time To Kill, his first - so glad I did it that way, all those years of working with no time to read have allowed me to save one of life's greatest pleasures - reading - for my golden years!

B001706I5I|4.0|Classic show.  Always enjoyable to watch.  Still catching things I didn't see when I saw it originally.  Great for the holidays.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wonderful, great follow up to A Time to Kill, another Grisham thriller!  Anyone that liked A Time to Kill will enjoy this one again.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I have long liked the Piano Guys' style of music.  I also have a great appreciation for GOOD Christmas Music.  I bought this CD without even looking to see what songs were on it because I knew that I would enjoy it.  The talent in this music is amazing and does not disappoint me even once.  Definitely a favorite for me this Christmas season.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem's second LP is incredibly original. He isn't like other artists who recycle chunks of other songs, but he brings backs tastes of them.<br /><br />The CD's beats aren't as great as in Bad Meets Evil, but the lyrics are much better.<br /><br />I recommend this to everybody and anybody who will listen.<br /><br />The only thing I wish he would do is stop using homophobic terminology.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Favorite Christmas album! Uplifting, Fun, Inspirational. The Piano Guys truly do put their heart and soul into every note! Captures the magic and the miracle of Christmas!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|It was a very thought provoking movie and makes you wonder how much of this goes on in our real world.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|The wisdom and understanding of human nature and the universe we inhabit laid out in this book is staggering. I reread this book every few years and each time discover something new both in the novel itself and within myself.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|OMG!  Where do I begin?  I picked up this CD a week ago and I have not gone one day without listening to it front to back.  This easily is their best album since Empire.  Many times, the listener is not sure whether it is Geoff Tate singing or his replacement (La Torre).  La Torre's voice brings excitement, passion, energy and charisma and the whole band seems more energized (something that has been lacking for the last 20 years).<br /><br />Tate's voice has been on a decline given his age (and ego)  and La Torre's addition is a definite kick in the pants.  I can't wait for their next effort.<br /><br />I LOVE this CD!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|There have been more than enough summaries of the movie, comparisons to the book and various opinions offered about the plot, characters, acting etc, etc so this review will focus solely upon the quality of the Blu Ray itself and my rating is based on that.  For that matter, all my reviews are always based upon the quality of the transfer of a film to Blu Ray.  So lets begin.<br /><br />VIDEO…<br />  The video transfer is excellent in every way with great saturation of colors during the color grading post production without having colors over saturated.  There is a warmness to the grading without it being artificial in any way that I can see.  Colors do not pop in an unnatural manner.  The Mbps rate is one of the highest I have seen averaging in the low 40's which means they have packed a lot of data on this blu ray which results in greater resolution and sharper contrast.  At no point did I notice any distracting grain or artifacting during the film. While the movie certainly  has many green and blue screen effects and CGI manifestations, I noticed no haloing as a result no stair-steppiing in the long wide angle shots of the audience. While the 'monster dogs' do take on a CGI appearance to me, they are what they are, a computer generated prop the rulers use to bring the 'contest' to closure. Blacks are deep without sacrificing details which can be seen even in the tiniest of articles.  For example, when Rue dies and is laid on a bed of tiny flowers, each flower can easily be discerned without being a mush of white pedals.  An excellent video transfer in all ways.<br /><br />AUDIO….<br />  For me, the audio production is the star of the disc.  DTS MA HD, a lossless audio codec, is offered in both a 5.1 and 7.1 configuration.  Having a fairly esoteric home theater system, I set it to produce a 7.1 audio stage and the audio editing, which often gets the short straw in films due to either budget or just poor audio editing, is absolutely outstanding and completely demo worthy for those who want to show off their systems capabilities.  There is an undeniable immersion of natural audio that surrounds you with completely discreet sounds from all 7 channels that brings you totally into the movies' environment.  This is especially so when the film movies into the games in the forest scenes.  Discreet directionality of the audio is fantastically all around you throughout the majority of the film.  The LFE sub channel is given plenty to do in added bottom end ambience and a couple of natural sounding explosions.  Dialogue is clear and transparent and audio leveling done right so you don't have to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control.  I realize that most home theater owners use a 5.1 system and I have played that as well.  You won't be disappointed by the audio at any time.  I do wish that all Blu Rays, especially of this type of film, where action is a main component of the movie, would offer an audio 7.1 option.<br /><br />EXTRAS….<br />  There are a great many extras and I can't say I have watched them all yet, however, I did watch the featurette on the making of the special effects and one on the post production of the film and was very impressed with them both for being informative without self congradulating pats on the back.  Another excellent feature was the 'DTS Sound Check' which creates audio taken from the film and sends it discreetly to each of your channels so that you know that  your audio system is set up and balanced correctly.  You can choose between a 5.1 and a 7.1 system for this feature and it can save you some time and puzzlement if your system is incorrectly wired or if the little ones in the house pulled a wire off without your knowledge or accidentally pressed the wrong button on your processor remote.  There are several other extras as well that I look forward to watching.<br />  The one big negative on the disc is that there are 5 or 6 previews and ads for other movies and ultraviolet.  The consumer does not want to pay for advertising which simply takes up disc space demanding even more compression of the film. I really hate previews on DVDS or Blu Rays.<br />  Also included is a digital disc which you can use to either download to iTunes or Ultraviolet.  I personally do not care for Ultra Violet and like to have the digital disc on hand.<br /><br />All in all, while this may or may not be your favorite film, the actual transfer of it to Blu Ray is excellent in every way.  I do  hope this review has been of some help to your in deciding your purchase.  All my reviews focus on the disc's quality and maybe they will be of help to you as well.<br />Thanks for reading.he consumer does not want to pay for advertising which simply takes up disc space demanding even more compression of the film.

B00FATEJYE|1.0|I love this game for the console, and I would love to play it on the kindle, but it won't even download. I have tried many times, and it has been enormously slow and won't even download correctly. I want to play the game, experience it, and give it a good review, put I can do none of those things if it will not download.
B005K01VZS|3.0|Inspiring to those who believe and trust in Him. Second book I have read since college,ha ha. Both by same author, thank you.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really needed an alarm app so I installed this one and it is absolutely amazing. You can customize it into your favorite color, make your own timer, and it is an amazing alarm. If I were you, I would install it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING, ADDICTIVE, FUN . MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT EACH MOVE . LOVE IT. Friends can see where you have been and where your going .
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Must play......may not put it down. :)you can play for hours. Great graphics and lots of fun. Just try it once.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Not a bad app, if you're interested in an icon and a menu screen.  If you actually wanted to use the camera, I would suggest another app.
B004LUS390|1.0|did not work añd could not access any of the animes.  was a waste of titime and energy.  would not reccomend.
B00005S6K6|3.0|This movie misses the mark so to speak for two reasons. First it is the story of the  deliberate actions, apparently without much thought, of two people who are married to other people.  In particular, the DeNiro character has two young children as well as a charming wife.  Streep's character has an attractive, seemingly nice husband who is a doctor so provides her with a nice life style. It is simply never explained satisfactorily why these two people would allow themselves to become involved. It sort of &#34;leaves a bad taste in the mouth&#34;.  Neither spouse deserves to be dumped on like this. The other problem with the movie is that DeNiro is miscast.  He is mostly a character actor and not a romantic lead.  You just never believe him in the role.  He is too small next to Streep who is a pretty good sized woman. Mostly, he simply appears to be uncomfortable in the role. Ms Streep is, of course, wonderful and looks lovely.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Absolutely beautiful! The Piano Guys' rendition of traditional songs is fresh but still classic. Some of the songs are definitely worth listening to year round!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Really great love story, aside from all the sex. I hated the ending! Such a cliffhanger. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|As with all their compilations, TPG's Christmas music is brilliant and refreshing! Something different from the every day Christmas songs we hear.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever I couldn't find any bugs and it was perfect and I think every one should get it its even free!
B003QP4NPE|5.0|It's a very compelling read and being a computer professional, it is also relevant.  I could not put it down.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|I love movies which keep me thinking long after I watch them.  Zero Dark Thirty is one of those movies.  I've watched Zero Dark Thirty twice since I purchased the DVD this year.  It now has a place on the shelf I reserve for movies I will watch over and over in the coming years.<br /><br />I find the issues Zero Dark Thirty raises complex on many levels.  When I look at it from the angle of &#34;We always get our man,&#34; it seems pretty straightforward.  One woman went after Osama Bin Laden and never gave up against monumental odds.  Through her determination Bin Laden was brought down, never to do harm again.  In this respect, Zero Dark Thirty is well done and entertaining, as movies should be.  It's also a sign of the times, where a woman can be the hero, actively putting an end to one of the world's worst criminal masterminds.  And given the views of the Islamic terrorists as to the value of women, the fact that the hero in Zero Dark Thirty is a woman is especially sweet.<br /><br />But the information which ultimately led to Bin Laden's assassination is shown to have been obtained through some pretty classic torture techniques.  Torture which is designed to wear down and humiliate someone until they understand that they are nothing and no one is coming to rescue them, at which point they will, in theory, spill the beans, tell us stuff we want to know.  I have an old brainwashing manual which was part of the training given to certain members of our military in the 1950s.  Methods may have changed somewhat, but the psychology is the same.<br /><br />Zero Dark Thirty presents torture techniques without a moral discussion.  And it attributes those techniques with the successful gathering of information which ultimately leads to the assassination of Bin Laden.  By not exploring the morality of what was done, the thing that runs through my mind as I watch this movie is pretty much exclusively the morality of the torture used to obtain the information, and the morality of assassinating someone when there were other options during the raid on his compound.<br /><br />In writing this review I'm not arguing for a right or wrong to our use of torture during the Bush years, or our current assassination policy, or the killing of Bin Laden.  But there should be a discussion.  More importantly, there should be a discussion of the larger policies.  For me Zero Dark Thirty is a voice on one side of that discussion.  I'm hoping there will sometime very soon be many more voices on the other sides of the issue.  There is an argument to be made that we may not be doing ourselves any favors with the current policies.  Not only from an ethical viewpoint.  But from the viewpoint of efficacy.  Are these policies producing the results we need?<br /><br />Over thirty-million people were slaughtered, many in the most horrible ways possible, in Hirohito's name as the head of the Japanese during World War II.  Yet, as portrayed in the recent movie, The Emperor, we let him live.  Why?  Because ultimately it made the world a safer place.  Killing Osama Bin Laden and the other top players in the Islamic Terrorist movements doesn't seem to have stopped the Islamic terrorist war against the West.<br /><br />In comparing the message from Zero Dark Thirty and The Emperor, we can celebrate the victory in Zero Dark Thirty.  But it seems pretty hollow.  I hope someday to watch a movie where an actual resolution to the problem of Islamic terrorism is the subject.  Like most problems of this magnitude, I'm guessing the resolution may be more like what is portrayed in The Emperor, and not have much to do with policies of torture and assassination.  The reality is, in both conflicts we won the military war.  It's been the opportunity at peace where the policy of inclusion in The Emperor seems to have succeeded far better than what we see in Zero Dark Thirty.  If one considers the policies in Zero Dark Thirty, we've evidently relegated an entire class of people tobe our perpetual enemy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device is great. Though I have seen some mixed reviews on quality of streaming (Lag and breakage), I didn't observed any. Solid 720p on my 40&#34; TV is great. It works so seamlessly and I love it.<br />The only issue I feel is the limited Apps through which you can stream data from a mobile. When it comes to laptop, the &#34;Cast the Tab&#34; option opens endless possibility. By opening the Apps like games would truly be great. (Developers already have a piles of Apps created and Google is little conservative is opening the flood gates) Finger crossed.<br />Its a steel for ~30 bucks.
0345803485|5.0|I can relate to certain aspects of this book. Ie. being torn between what is a healthy relationship and what isn't. I just ordered books 2 & 3
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Was a fun movie and pretty entertaining.  Is worth watching, but it is not a family viewing type of movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|IT IS AWESOME AND MINE CRAFT IS STUPID AND THE WORLDS ARE MORE STUPID THAN THE NAME OF THE GAME.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|A fun movie with great talent enjoying themselves.  I talked my library into buying the book when it first came out and while I was surprised to see that it was adapted as a comedy (birding is SERIOUS!), I thought it did a good job except for having the Snowy Owl being an elusive life bird.  Everyone can get involved and learn more about birds with the Christmas Bird Count and Project Feeder Watch.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|What can I say - it's the boys!  Great show.  Gets better and better.  Looking forward to Seasons 9 and 10.  If you're new to the series, start with Season 1 and enjoy!  Great writing, funny-scary, great charisma and chemistry between Jared and Jensen and terrrific supporting players and guest stars.  Misha Collins is great also.  The show has a huge and extremely loyal fan base and if you watch it, you'll understand.  Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Warning, contains Jar Jar Binks.<br />No one should have to see Jar Jar, so I recommend watching in &#34;Machete Order.&#34;<br />Watch in this order:<br />Episode IV<br />Episode V<br />Episode II<br />Episode III<br />Episode VI<br /><br />There is no need to ever watch Episode I. Just don't.<br /><br />Other than the need to avoid Jar Jar, I really enjoy the quality of the video. In fact, the original footage looks so good on Blu-Ray that the additional CGI added in the 1997 re-release looks even more out of place.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Very interesting and put together very well. the first time i saw this i was amazed at the originality and variety contained within the Animatrix.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This a fun game for Kindle fire! Good graphics! No money needed to play, U can share on fb &amp;&amp; follow other players scores.<br />The only complaint for me is my Kindle fire throws me off in the middle of a game. Probably about 45% of the time...
B00EB6ENXO|2.0|Mandarin is the reason why this movie is messed up. If you watched the movie you know what I mean.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Graphics are super. Really enjoying this game. Hints are available and directions on where to go. Storyline is different from monsters etc.  Loving it  keep up the great work.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The packaging is awesome.  It's classy, great artwork, and it put a smile on my face the moment I opened it up to just flip through the art.  The menus are your standard affair.  I can't really say I play around with the disc content much as I typically have the intention on watching the desired movie start to finish without having to play around with scene selection or bookmarks or whatever these fancy players are capable of doing nowadays.<br /><br />As far as the media content...I'm sure you've read in countless sources about the additional edits to movies.  They're DISTRACTING, and I really hope to find a re-release of this set with those edit REMOVED.  Vader screaming &#34;NOOOOOOOOOOO&#34; at the end of Episode III was already a laughable affair, so I can't quite see where one thought it was okay to add this talentless moment to the end of Return of the Jedi.  The scream Kenobi performs to scare off the Tuskens in Episode IV was also very confusing and felt very out of place. I take solace in the fact that the trademarks now belong in different hands.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|Compare Sandra Bullock with her similar goofy FBI character in HEAT.  Both are adorable.  Sandra Bullock and cast butcher the slang of the 20th century in this futuristic crime drama (comedy).
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Like the game but it takes to long to gather enough money to buy the buildings and a requirement is placed on a character before you reach the level required to fulfil the requirement.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I bought this for my grandson who loves drums.  His first birthday and he knew what to do with it.  Different sounds from the different fingers on the wooden head.  Hollow body for excellent volume and resonance.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|We love this movie. Its packed with suspense and action. The 2nd one is just as good. I recommend it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book has helped me to understand how my brain works and why I do some things I do, and how to change my negative habits. It also provided me with good insight on why organizations do what they do. Greatly recommended!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very entertaining and fun for all ages. My boys and I compete on every level. I like how easy it is to upgrade the weapons. And also how many different hunts they have.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|The game is amazing its just like mario and Luigi so fun to play the last level is so hard it took me a month at most  i like<br /><br />  - - hey mossies its me ur buddy Isabel misses u comment on this game
B00A23MYCC|5.0|awesome product.. very pleased. good quality. exactly what was described. I am very happy with the product. No problems with it!
B001FOPODS|5.0|I absolutely love this version of Peter and the Wolf. That being said.... I teach elementary school music and cannot use this movie in my classroom. It is far too dark. There are guns and poverty and soldiers, etc. This movie would be wonderful to use in middle or high school to compare/contrast with another version. But it's just not for my elementary school students. As an adult, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of Peter and the Wolf. It has brought new light to the story for me.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|awesome product.. very pleased. good quality. exactly what was described. I am very happy with the product. No problems with it!
B00F522C7C|4.0|Love this film.  A lot of fun.  I loved cars and everything else by Pixar.  You should watch this film.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|This is my third read by Janet,Evanovich. I started out reading her Wicked series and got hooked and disappointed at the same time. She has only two novels in the Wicked series. I finally got tired of waiting for her next book and started on the Stephanie Blum series. What a pleasant surprise to find a similar cast of characters. i did enjoy the plots better in Wicked but willing to try a few more of her Plum books.
1451695195|3.0|The muddy place described by the author just didn't ring true for me and then I read the expose.<br />He has had both financial and ethical problems
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. It was so different reading a story which was being told by a dog!  It made me both laugh and cry.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and this is one of his best books. Much better than the movie
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is an excellent book, one of John Grisham's best!  I enjoyed being re-introduced to the characters of Ford County.
006202406X|1.0|Well I was depressed all day after reading this book. My therapy has been reading the reviews. I am happy to know other people felt the same way, and I have now changed the ending in my mind. But beyond the depressing ending, I was disappointed with the entire book. It made no sense, I was expecting something much more creative outside the fences. I won't repeat everything that's been said here, there are some well written reviews of this book. I won't be seeing the movie unless Allegiant is rewritten.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|Great movie, the first is better but this one has it's own unique twist on the adventure. Still a great watch and we keep re-watching it since we bought it in 2011.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it was the best game ever and I was mad when it wasn't on my kindle but I finally cam
B00GPE9HEA|5.0|This is the first Britney Spears album I've ever purchased and I have to say I was not dissapointed. This album is amazing and I feel like I'm listening to an adult and not a teen pop princess. This album is a must have for any one who likes pop music at it's best. Love it, Love it, Love it!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved the book it filled me with excitment and joy as I read the wonderful book. It is a must read!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is Addicting. Plus its free which is always better. And there are so many options to get what you need with out having to purchase anything
B00FY9JJYA|4.0|Solid offering overall.  3 Great songs.  Good Blend of artists.  Relatively smooth flow overall.  Somebody Else has an outstanding vibe
B00A50PBEA|5.0|The Magic Flute is an amazing opera. This is not the first time it has been wonderfully produced. But this version gives the feeling of seeing and hearing it for the first time. To accommodate the setting in World War 1 the characters and their actions take on  different meanings, giving this a really fresh feeling. And new insights. Tamino and Pagageno are engaged in trench warfare, and the storyteller manages to weave in the miraculous Christmas truce, called spontaneously by the troops of both sides, into the story. A really enjoyable experience.
B00EJYGQFG|1.0|My bad, but I though I was getting more songs. Seriously, two songs for $9.00? What a rip off. And yes, this is my review of my purchase which includes in part anything and everything about this product.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is the best 1st offering I have heard from a new/young band in a very long time.  It reminds me of the first time I heard Kings of Leon, Coldplay and/or the White Stripe's first studio releases.  You just feel the combination of talent and timing coming together in a unique (if only for the time) form.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The greatest of all series and has so many amazing parts!! Such a sad ending though:(<br /><br />Definitely a must read.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|I know this movie is not everyone's cup of tea, but its definitely mine.  It captures a wonderful ideal of sexual and intellectual chemistry w/o all the other sociologically learned crap that we just can't shake.  The record store scene and song are my favorite moment.  My wife hates the song (What's wrong with her?).  Joking.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved much more then I thought I would. I gave it a try and it hooked me. Starting the next book now.
B0090X4GLW|3.0|I love Pitch Perfect, so for that reason, this product is great.  The down side is that the CD has some songs that sound way different than they do in the movie....if I am buying the soundtrack from a movie, I want it to sound just like it did when I watched it.  The audition song, &#34;Since You Been Gone&#34; is only two of the singers instead of the whole group, and the song from the riff off when Anna Kendrick sings &#34;No Diggity&#34; sounds AWFUL compared to how it is done in the movie.  I also wish they would have included a few more of the songs from the movie, such as the remixes Anna Kendrick's character makes, or when she sings 'Bulletproof' mixed with their performance song.  Overall, while I LOVE this movie, the CD for it really disappoints.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pleasurable app as good as the buck Hunter I had on my PC years ago; did not expect this quality on my tablet.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I have listened to this album non stop ever since it was released!  I love it! My favorite is O Come, Emmanuel.
1932100660|5.0|Finally the truth!<br />I am so very tired of the lies told by major coorporations and the government just to make money.<br />If our government took to heart the facts in this study like the all out war on smoking....then we would be a healthier nation.... but the richest doctors, lawyers and CEOs would loose money.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I am amazed at the incredible talent that these guys have. I have been a HUGE fan of Jon Schmidt, but when you add Steven and &#34;the Guys&#34;: brilliant, touching, breathtakingly stirring...these words are so inadequate a description for this musical experience. I find each day that I listen to one song over and over, only to find another one on another day that I must play over and over. This CD and Live at Red Butte Gardens came at the same time and I find that when I wake up in the mornings these melodies run through my mind. What a wonderful way to begin the day! Thank you for the time that you spend away from your families to bring a bit of Heaven to mine.....
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|If you’ve been browsing the reviews, yes – it’s that good. This book was recommended by many bloggers and forums, and I will happily declare that this is the best book I’ve read this year!<br /><br />There are many things that worked for me in this book: style, point of view, the plot and characters, the moral of the story, etc., but I think what really impressed me was the consistency and continuity.  It’s incredibly difficult for authors to keep their characters consistent when they are growing up in front of their audience.  This work is probably the best example that I can recall where the author was able to achieve such a feat.<br /><br />The story is of a great warrior, Vaelin Al Sorna, who somehow became a prisoner for five years, but is now being led to his death under the pretense of a final battle against the renowned fighter Shield.  The story is told by Vaelin to a scribe who cannot contain his animosity towards Vaelin. The tale begins with Vaelin’s childhood in the Sixth Order where he was dropped off by his father when he was about 10 years old.  The Sixth Order is a military wing of the entire religious Order of the Faith.  The book takes us through years of Vaelin and his Order brothers training and into their first assignments and, finally, the war.<br /><br />The worldbuilding is very interesting and full of schemes, plots and secrets.  Religion, with all of its variety, is on the forefront of the many plots, machinations and wars.  Along with religion, or against it, depending on how one looks at it, there is the Dark afflicted– people with magical abilities that are somehow innate.  The world is learnt through Vaelin’s eyes, so we began to understand his and his family’s purpose when he’s still a boy, then politics as a youth and finally his credo as a man.<br /><br />If you like Assassin’s Apprentice, The Name of the Wind or The First Law trilogies, you’ll most likely enjoy Blood Song.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|really fun game.  could spend lots of money, but seems you can get by for free if you dont get too addicted
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great match-three game<br />must design more like CC but more things to do in levels. besides. crush. jellies. &amp; bring apple &amp; cherries down to bottom...but love the game.
B009EE70J2|3.0|The movie was a little boring. The acting was OK. The best part was the scenery. My expectations may have been to high.
B001O03NCW|5.0|You cannot go wrong with good bluegrass music and this sound tract is great. Of course the title song is great by it self
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|It is exactly what a Freecell game should be.  Runs great in my Samsung Galaxy S2.  It has already devoured way too much of my time.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I really have not used it and need to review why I added it to my Kindle have no more to say and hope I have written enough
1856697525|5.0|This is an amazing book at an amazing price.  A birthday gift for my boyfriend and he really finds it fascinating.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Again not sure what this does and not sure what I added it for will need to research it more.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A continuation of the Band Of Brothers leaving Europe and continuing in the Pacific Battles Great set of films. Lots of action.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|I havent gone very far in the game yet since i haven't bought anything but it still has been fun so far. Sometimes the game will start upside down which throws off the controls but i just restart my kindle and it fixes, not a big deal.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The piano guys are amazing! LOVE this new Christmas album. It is everything you wish to hear for the Holidays, sitting around your Christmas tree with friends and family.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Works great, is quiet, and very nice for the price! Fits well in claw type grip and the weights are great to perfect your personal touch.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|When it works it's awesome.. However, even though I have a strong wifi signal it seems to loose sight of it all the time and not work. In fact it hasn't worked for over a month now and I've pretty much given up on it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I'm addicted to this game it's amazing I saw it for free and downloaded it right  away.superman is my favourite person he is beast like django.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fits my needs perfectly, never had a problem. I like using it on my Kindle Fire HD. I don't have to squint or don my reading glasses to read the display.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this silly game. I was a late starter playing the game so now I wish I had just resisted completely. I play every down time I have.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The book did start to slow a bit, but then it moved.... moving on to the next one.  Can't wait!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I couldn't find a better app for free......gives the novice everything they want in a very simple locating device.....I would recommend to all my friends
B00G32QIEG|1.0|This movie was well below my expectations, and I wasn't expecting cleverness or well-rounded characters...just some light entertainment. I enjoy stupid movies from time to time, but this didn't make the cut. The best thing I can say? At least I didn't spend the money to see it in the theaters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|amazing game love it but can you please let us keep are characters when we switch worlds .thank you for subway surfers
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Classic material, I'm on my forth or fifth read through. HATE the movie poster style cover. Still more than worth the purchase though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great if your standing in line at the bank sitting in the drive thru or just wasting time at work. lol
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it really helps and as soon as i downloaded never gave me trouble. it works a when you set the alarm clock and has good waynto show the clock.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|My kids introduced me to this music because they love it so much. We cannot get enough of it. Fantastic!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I have seen the movies many times but not once read the book. So finding it I read ,<br />and it was absolutely moving I cried, I smiled, and even clapped a great story indeed.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I only watched the trailer and I wanted to watch it. I thought it was great fantasy.  Just like a book takes u places u never been too or will never go too.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome, you can do man things, my favorite late is that it is actually realistic, and amazing
B002N5N4M6|4.0|Hilarious as usual. I think this show just gets better and better the farther into it that you get. Love it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fantastic game but very addictive can't wait to play all the time and to meet new people good game well done
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Wonderful music arrangements! Great mix of songs. Having the free MP3 download is great so I don't have to wait for the CD. Thanks Piano Guys!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an amazing story. I couldn't stop reading the book! Part of the &#34;blame&#34; goes to my Kindle Paperwhite which makes reading in the dark so easy - without disturbing anyone, that is. The end of the story is somewhat abrupt. But anyway: Highly recommended. And today I learned that my 6th grade daughter is dealing with this subject matter at school!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I was looking for some annotations, but lacking with this app.  Also, tedious and slow navigation issues dissuaded me from using the app, and I removed it from my kindle.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Time travel is always fascinating, offering a look at the author's vision of a possible past or future.  This book does both and does it beautifully and plausibly. The story was wonderful. As usual, I ended the book newly convinced that no other contemporary author does characterization as well as King.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It is a basic calucator and does the trick for basic math. I would recommend this to anyone needing a basic calculator.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I've never played this game before, but I've heard quite a bit about the board game from friends. It is a fun, but challenging game where you have to play offense and defense at the same time while looking at the end-game picture as well as the current move...(if I put this tile here, does it score me any points? Does it let my opponent score points? Am I committing a follower that I might prefer to use somewhere else?)<br /><br />There don't seem to be any permission issues (nothing reported by any anti-spyware/anti-virus) and the game plays without WiFi/data connection, so no security concerns.<br /><br />There are a couple small issues, for me, at least.<br />1. When you place a tile and are given the opportunity to commit one of your followers...it's hard to tell if the outlined shape is on a cloister, city, road, field, etc. Maybe some kind of labels or colors to set them apart? I've had a couple instances where I thought I was putting a follower in a city but it ended up in the field outside the city (and therefore not available for the rest of the game).<br />2. The brief scoring overview in the tutorial is not really enough to predict what's going to happen at the end of the game, so you can't really decide if it's better to put a follower in a city that will have a lot of tiles but probably never be completed or to put it on a road or field somewhere else.<br /><br />As the FAOTD, I recommend getting this app. I'm having quite a bit of fun just learning how to play and score the game and devise strategies.<br />At the regular price of $4.99...it seems like a great implementation, so if you've played the board game and liked it, go ahead and get it. That still seems a bit steep, but you can tell a lot of work went into making this app, so it's worth it if you know you like the game.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Initial impression was, this is going to be fun! And of course I immediately like Travis, and his feelings for 'Pidge', aka Abby started to develop right in front of his face very early, even before they officially started dating. At the beginning I thought Abby was a bit hypocritical and irritating, where I liked America her friend more.  As the story progressed, I started really loving Travis.There were some hilarious scenes as well as some very sad ones.
0887431453|5.0|I bought that for my daughter year before we planned to put her in preschool. Great preparation, gives a great start to little preschoolers..
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Of course it is not as good as the book, no book to movie ever is.  That's the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars.  It did follow the book fairly well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game is very addictive. Can't get enough of candy crush wish pet rescue saga was available also.
B00DGN51O8|1.0|This movie sucks. I tried to watch it twice, but both times I just wanted to shut it off. Terrible.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book of the series. I have read it over and over again.  You should definitely read it.  It is amazing!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This game was on the xbox 360 and I loved it now to see it on android that is just awesome. It lloks and feels the same if I was to play it on either system just a smaller screen.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Been waiting for the &#34;CS&#34; for awhile, the solutions from Plantronics have generally been single focused. You could either get a UC headset, deskphone headset, an IP Phone/Soft Phone headset or a mobile headset, never could you cross integrate seamlessly with only one headset.<br /><br />With dual pairing, I am able to use this as a both a deskphone and mobile headset. Switching between calls and function is easy while talk quality and performance of product is exceptional for a top of the range bluetooth headset.<br /><br />This would have been a 5 stars if it included the other essential options as a set - The Plantronics Bluetooth USB Adapter to allow UC usage and the Plantronics Charge Case.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|I totally enjoy this game; keep up the good work gameloft. Also, thank you for adding daily play to increase earning coins and gems
B000062V9C|2.0|This is an extremely cute movie. Had to send this back because region 2 isn't the usa and the disc wouldnt play wish amazon wouldve stated that. It was a birthday gift for my 2yo and she had to wait till well after her birthday for me to get at walmart
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I hate dealing with keeping batteries on hand and switching out every so often. This takes care of that problem. Just need an open usb port and to remember to put your mouse on top of charger when not using. Would recommend
0393345084|5.0|Ron and Rand Paul could do with reading this Paul with an open mind. Bottom line: Either we are in charge of our economic system or it is in charge of us.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This a great way to waste time!  I love this game except it hurst my eyes after a while.  It's really bright.  But I won't stop playing until I run out of boards.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|easy to use and for free . happy to have it and I truly recommend<br /> to the  others to have it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of my favorite games I love to play it so much fun I play it almost every day
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a funny approach to some serious and some laughable moments in life. I wish I could write like this. I really love the goose story.
B0084TWN9K|1.0|I didn't understand the author's characters at all and wondered about the point of each tale. I would not recommend reading the book and I will not read another of hers.
B0029VUV70|5.0|A story of cruelty, manipulation, forgiveness, redemption, and love from a different perspective. It is an interesting observation on the acts of inhumanity people will commit in their zeal to please their government without any regard to human life. And the code of silence within a society that accepts evil and then a generation later pretends to be shocked. Excellent acting.
B002S43V3Y|3.0|This one of the weirdest love stories you'll ever watch.  Harold is a morbid man-child obsessed with death and suicide (faked).  The beginning of the movie is very funny as Harold's faked suicide attempts are performed for the benefit, but not the enjoyment, of his mom and acquaintances.  His intimate relationship with Maude, an 80 plus free spirit, helps Harold turn from the dark side to appreciating life.  This is NOT for kids and probably not for most pre-teens and teens.  The implied physical relationship between Maude and Harold is likely to be too uncomfortable for most young people and many adults.  If you like more current movies like Shawn of the Dead you'll like this one.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|After following the simple and clear instructions to connect this to my network, and entering my complex wifi password several times and rebooting everything several times, I still can't connect this to my network. It is going back.<br />The TV commercials make it look like you can use this to put you computer/tablet/phone screen on the TV with a wave of your hand. I'm not sure what it does that my perfect Roku can't do better.<br />The forums and the chromecast support point to router issues. All my stuff is right, 2.4 ghz network like they say, but they have a number of routers listed that won't work with this.<br />Dude, it's a network. How hard can it be??
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger works much faster.  It takes only 2 hours to fully charge my kindle fire compared to 6-7 hours with the original charger.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this series several decades past and, obviously, have begun reading the series again.  I enjoy the story line and some of the moral, ethical, political and scientific issues presented.  However, in depth development is lacking.  In particular the science presented is weak especially in light of NASA's recent revelation of research efforts in developing a space time bubble that may, within a hundred years, permit travel to the nearest stars with a journey time of 2 weeks (essentially a &#34;warp drive&#34;).  Greater development of the writings of 2 characters, Locke and Demosthenes, would have addressed the other 3 issues.
B003O86FMW|3.0|An easy read that kept my attention. It has an Interesting plot and nice development of secondary characters in my opinion.
B0012QRPU4|1.0|Saw pilot. New type of program for us.  Not sure we will watch more.  Plus,need to pay $2 per episode.<br />.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The only problem with this story is that it was over too soon.  Now I'm just waiting for the next one!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I LOVE this album and will play this all year round! I  can't wait to see them in concert in 20 days!!
0553212753|5.0|rememberingone of the first books that I read during my school time, great to refresh all the characters, a simple to read book
B008U7ZPHS|2.0|Too many coincidences and loose ends not coming together neatly- a sense that the author perhaps willy-nilly wanted to close the book somehow is the feeling that I got.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Andrea Bocelli has over the years become my favourite artist of all time. The dvd in this release is stunning and the live performances on the cd are even better than the studio tracks on 'Passione'. I saw Andrea in a live concert recently, where he sang everything from opera to Neapolitan songs, sacred arias and pop, including some pieces from 'Love in Portofino'. He was fantastic - it is easy to see why the audiences love him!
B00130VLZ4|5.0|Like the protection of the case without all the added bulk.  It carries well and secures tightly around the camera and strap.  Worth every penny!
145160713X|5.0|Walter Lewin is an amazing person.  His passion and love for physics is shown through his way of teaching! An amazing journey! Recommended to anyone interested in science.
0385523394|4.0|Enjoyable read. Pleasantly personal account of one woman's experience doing &#34;short time.&#34; The author explicitly states that she has chosen to focus on the more positive interactions of her short stay rather than on the lurid, violent interactions that readers of &#34;Prison Lit&#34; might have come to expect. Neither does she overtly attempt to write a pseudo-psychological/sociological treatise on prisons in general; a wise decision on her part since her background and experience are so limited.<br /><br />What she does show is the often-overlooked fact that women do time differently from men; that is, women tend to have the same general issues of power, control, gang affiliations, etc, and women are just as devious, manipulative and exploitative as the men are ---- both with each other and with staff ---- but the tools they use to meet their needs are significantly feminine. That's what this book, from the author's personal and limited experience, shows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game. My daughter and I play it together almost everyday. She just can't get enough of the minions!
015603283X|4.0|Having seen the movie based on this book, I came in with lots of expectations, all of which were promptly destroyed. In fact, I'm planning to re-read this novel to appreciate its meta-fiction elements: a pleasure I robbed myself of the first time around.<br /><br />People tend to say that &#34;the book was so much better than the movie,&#34; no matter which movie/book is being discussed. In the case of this book, the book and the movie bear only a distant relationship to each other. The book's plot is not linear; its structure is not one-dimensional; its subject matter is not &#34;cops and robbers&#34;; its ending is not predictable. In fact, its geography is not Paris or Rome at all.<br /><br />Wonderfully delightful escapist read. It not only had me laughing at myself in the end, but had me wanting to turn right back to page 1 to let the author play his tricks on me all over again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed how true this story seemed. I liked the characters and how the book flowed. It was easy to read and captured my interest. Truley a story about life and learning how much it can change and how much we can learn from each other.
0061438294|5.0|very practical book and easy to follow- this is a must read for everyone who wants to understand people better.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|Well! give me Bill Holden any day  This is a very good to great flick.  All performances are right on the money.  I loved the dancing scene with Kim & Bill dancing to &#34;Picnic&#34;  then found out he couldn't dance a step.  I got over it. & still love this one.
0609610570|5.0|very practical book and easy to follow- this is a must read for everyone who is in business or who wants to improve their life.
B002W7P5UE|5.0|The scenes in the railway car with Eva Marie Saint and Cary are sexy and totally clever. Hitch again.  He was such an inventive director.
0811879542|5.0|My 6 year old nephew loves this book. After receiving it he read it nightly for weeks laughing, shaking and pressing all the way through.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|Totally charming! Cary as an angel with a bit of devilish desires for Loretta & a really good job by David Niven too- whole cast was great.  Charming holiday movie
B0042TV4IW|3.0|The final season seemed &#34;tacked on&#34; to wrap things up. Clear character motivations were lacking. Watch the first three seasons, and pretend there's no fourth...
B000MQPU7U|4.0|It took &#34;The Directors Cut&#34;- for me to really get this movie.  I'm a huge fan of Mitchum's.  He is my number one bad boy of the movies.  And oh those shoulders ! and looks.  There is only one Mitchum.  There is something in his performance that is him, just him. Older wiser and kinda not wanting to give it his all……. but it is worth the watch
