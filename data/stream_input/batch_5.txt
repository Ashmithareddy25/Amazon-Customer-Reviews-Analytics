B0050VONTS|5|Dose the job
B008Y9GJJK|5|No issues...fast delivery...easy install.  feeling the ac now.
B00467ELA8|5|The cheap $14 RV connectors like this [[ASIN:B00BMPXFSG PowerFit PF923055 240-volt 4-Prong Male Plug Adapter Twist for 30-Amp Female Connector]] would not work in my duromax, I could get maybe 7-10AMP from those.  As soon as I used this, 13,500btu AC, 2 refrigerators, TV, lights and any other accessories work without issues.
B001U2D6OO|5|It is very  good  condition  but  not  lights  to long  and the agasment  any  I still  have it garging  from the  sun thinks
B00OOJGSN6|4|Very cool
B0012GTVVA|5|makes shutting the door much easier
B00FIN63VE|5|Beautiful packaging and arrived sooner than expected. Gorgeous crafting.
B00V56U28I|3|I thing it's working.  Not sure what it does but the plate inside is changing color so I assume it is doing what it is designed to.
B00IFHNEYO|5|Grteat price and eary to install.
B00DZXMURU|5|Love these compared to the bright white ones.  No more silly blue glow from the instrument panel.
B00OZYDOT6|3|The fit is not horrible, but when you consider  there are more expensive options out there at 4 times the price, I'd still say it's a good value. The  biggest issue I had was there were absolutely no instructions. No pictures or diagrams, I had to guess at everything. I did find some YouTube vids for similar products, but it wasn't until after I installed the pieces. It does take a little creativity, like I had to make my own holes for the back seat headrest rods, and time will tell if I was able to secure everything well. The front looks good, but the steering wheel cover was too small for my Malibu.<br /> I would have given it another star had I not had the struggle figuring out what pieces go where and basic tips on how to best stretch it to fit well. I'm not confident I did it completely right, but we'll see how it wears over the next few months of use.
B000EDOSKG|5|Growing up we were only ever in one campground where we needed this.  The faucet they had was not threaded nor did it have a handle.  Luckily we had listened to a long time RVer we knew and picked up what was then called a Water Thief and an outdoor water faucet handle.  We got more then a few looks from other RVers as we filled up our water tank and a few that just asked what we had.  Odds are you may never need this but it was worth the cost the one time we did need it.  Because of that experience this was one of the first things I purchased for my RV.
B00D42AFS8|5|Everything  is  good
B003V57NUQ|5|These seem well-made and are a steal at this price.  The only issue is the assembly.<br /><br />EASY ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />The racks come with a one page sheet listing the parts on one side and a diagram on the other.  The kit comes with a dinky little wrench but toss that and get yourself a 1/2 socket wrench.  Unless you have a very deep 1/2 socket you will also need a 1/2 box or open-end wrench to tighten beyond the depth of your socket.  You can do without the socket wrench … it's just more work without it.<br /><br />Here's the secret to assembly.  You must place the rubber piece in boiling water for about 40-45 seconds!  If you don't do this, you are in for a very frustrating and irritating experience.  Also, I recommend assembling one bracket at a time … boil one rubber piece, assemble, boil the next rubber piece, assemble, etc. (I bought 2 sets so I had to do 4) so that the rubber is as pliable as possible when you need it to be.<br /><br />Another tip … lube the tips of the metal pieces.  Lube the inside of the larger piece and the outside of smaller piece with Vaseline so they will slide together easily.<br /><br />Assembly:<br />1. Slide the larger piece into the rubber from either side.  Refer to the diagram to make sure the rubber is right side up.<br /><br />2. Slide the smaller piece into the other end of the rubber and line up the tips so one will slip inside the other.  Once you get them mated, just give them a shove until fully seated (pretty easy if you lubed them).<br /><br />3. Next, peer down thru all 6 holes and massage the rubber piece so that you have clear passage thru the entire structure for all 6 holes.  Once you have that lined up, insert the 4 corner bolts.  Put the metal plate in place, add the washers and tighten with the locknuts as shown in the diagram.<br /><br />4. Now insert the long bolts, washer and tighten using the regular hex nuts (if you do this before tightening the corner bolts, the long bolts will impedeyour box or open-end wrench).  NOTE:  The diagram shows the washer and nut going on the long bolts underneath the bottom bracket … THE DIAGRAM IS WRONG!  All bolts should be tightened against the same metal plate.<br /><br />5. That's it for the assembly.  Just set each rack on the roof rail of your car, slide the bottom bracket in place and tighten with the plastic knobs.
B001C6Q7US|1|failed three days after installation.
B005QI4XPO|3|to much brake residue and dust makes noise when applied
B00GSAUHB8|2|Cost 2x as much as other similar product.  I also bought Car Sunshade Grande' Jumbo which cost 1/2 the price as this one and it's EXACTLY the same product.  Save yourself money and don't buy this sun shade..  check out Car Sunshade Grande' Jumbo
B00FJ5LBOA|4|Perfect for the price paid!
B001AM3LJ4|5|Fit perfectly in the back in my stock 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Jeep handles much better, ride is not floaty. Would also recommend the same shocks for the front too. Definitely a more firm ride, but then again the shocks that I removed were at least 10 years old...
B00X01S86E|5|Great product. Fit my 1973 Silverado well.
B00D3QXFHS|5|Good filter
B00CJ1X2W6|3|The sunshade fits perfectly in my car however its large size makes it difficult to put on and off the windshield. Also after leaving my car in the sun for a while it was pretty difficult to roll up the sunshade as I kept burning my fingers trying to make it wrap tight enough to secure it with the velcro strap. I also noticed the silver reflective surface is already starting to bubble a bit from the sun and i've only used the sunshade a handful of times. All in all it does its job it's just not the most convenient shade in the market.
B0007VANJK|4|as advertised perfect fit & all hardware included. Thanks
B000GOHUVM|3|Works but is almost as noisy as the old one.
B00FLSG6V8|4|Front mats fit good but, the back ones are a little small for a crew cab.
B000BQYH6Q|5|ideal for the wheels while working on your car
B001NZO8YU|5|My AC blower in my 2006 F150 would only work on high, after some research i decided this was the problem, replaced the resistor with this one from Amazon in about 10 min and all 4 fan speeds now work like they should. This was over 6 months ago and i have not had any issues
B005FKN3QI|4|Seams to have squishy Brakes now... Pedal goes down about 2+ inches now when before it only went down about 3/4 of an inch before solid... Kept bleeding brakes, even changed Master Cylinder and still squishy Brakes!! Must be pads or rotors as that's the only thing that's changed... Should have just thrown on the $12.00 set of pads, instead of $600.00 later with squishy brakes!!
B002YC2JN8|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B00QXU3LRU|5|looks just like the original Lance Camper sent with my Camper. Works perfect.
B00TPM298U|5|Good as OEM.
B000NJ97C0|5|Great for use in a travel trailer. Stays on the rail. A bit pricey, but a very good product.
B00XXQH7ZO|3|let this chge for 4 hrs and then tested it it was only putting out 11.6 volts i emailed factory and they said that was ok!! REALLY!!!! AS FAR AS I KNOE IT TAKES ABOUT 13 VOLTS TO START A CAR SO I TRIED IT ON MY QUAD AND IT WOULDNT START IT SO  THATS AS FAR AS I HAVE COME WITH IT!!
B00ECKI4WA|5|Stuff works amazing, I recommend it for sure!
B00T68UF2K|5|Everything I expected
B00QPQD1NQ|5|It is nice!<br />I bought it because of my car's battery.<br />It worn out once. after that sometimes it went out totally!!<br />I didn't have time to visit engineer<br />so I bought it for a temporary method.<br />It works perfectly~!<br />Now I fixed my car but still It is useful.<br />I can charge my phone during a trip with this stuff.
B00B1DLD9W|5|What can you say about a running light.  It is sturdy enough to be installed easily.  Only time will tell if it will stand this Florida sun and heat.
B00M7X79FM|1|I bought 10 of these and 4 failed within the first 6 months.  Company refuses to replace them.
B011ERI1NA|5|it work very good.
B00QKNIQPC|5|Love this product. Did not realize how big my storage area was until I received this Mat. Fits wonderfully and keeps the car clean.
B000C2SCR4|5|Perfect Fit for my 2006 Suzuki Vitara XL7
B0024NOBPG|4|These lights fit well on my 2001 (B5) VW Passat. My only complaint would be the adjusters. They adjust like the OEM headlights but feels flimsy. The right headlight wouldn't adjust fully to the right so it's pointing just a little towards the center of the road. The lens and reflectors look like OEM and performs no differently.
B003NX2F90|5|The lights are amazing!! They were easy to install on my 2004 Honda CBR600RR. They were mailed out earlier then I expected and the company they came from were very professional to me. They are extremely bright, easy to install and they came with everything you could need to install them in the most important spots.
B004YD1VIY|2|Didn't adequately bring seat belt away from short person's neck
B005R6FQVU|5|Fits perfect in 2012 Toyota Sienna. Much better quality than other brands I found as has more surface area and pleats for filtering. Would recommend.
B004G08K9I|5|Needed a simple grease gun for the lawnmower, and this does the job very well.  I hope it holds up a few years.
B00ARURM3G|5|fits like a condom so yea it works.
B004CLK3WS|5|Perfect! Exactly what I expected.
B00EEG7H84|3|Not an exact fit for a 2010 Mercedes-Benz E350 Sport, even though it said that it was a fit. The original hood emblem is curved and this emblem is straight. Therefore it lets moisture and dirt in, so I had to get creative and put a rubber gasket underneath it.
B005BP3U2Y|5|Ordered one for me and my sister for emergencies.
B010CZVDN0|5|Great product
B00G0PQPL2|5|Perfect fit in my 3rd gen 3sgte.
B0009I4UFO|5|Easy to install Fit great<br />Make sure the lock core is centered where you want it before tightening the anti-theft bolt (fixing bolt)
B00AVA2NPE|5|Legit
B00TEPMKA0|1|The first time this case was dropped from a small distance of 2' the wood cracked in multiple spots. It is a pretty case that provides zero protection against anything. This is a poor product that is not worth the price or wait to receive it from China.
B013XSCHXI|5|I got this for my husband who is a strong believer in the right to bear arms. I was very pleased with it when it came in. The sticker is 4x6 witch can easily be seen from a distance when placed on a car window.I had no trouble with puttling it on goes on very smoothly. It is made from a great grade laminate material. We placed it on the back glass. This is a great way to represent what we believe in! I would love to see many more of this stickers and fellow believers!  I did get this from the company in order to do a non biased review this is 100% my option on the product!
B0059ACNX8|5|Durable  so far no problems
B00IGIZ9NG|5|product as expected. Service and shipping AWESOME. Buy from them, you'll love the experience.
B000CNJN6W|3|Made in Taiwan :( Come on, America let's take our pride back.
B00LPYYF56|5|They definitely do the job.
B000C55Y54|1|didn't fit correctly had to get others after the vehicle was apart had the parts store check the pn for me and they should have worked but were way off very disappointed with this item and waisted a tone of time because of them
B0002TDUW4|5|Just rolled on my herculiner bed liner today. So far I am very impressed, it was more than enough product to do my 6.5 foot bed with 2 thick coats. Very easy to apply, now we will see how long it lasts.
B009YMJ0VK|1|Looked great. Cracked on first ride.<br />Thought maybe bolts were over tightened.<br />They weren't. Don't know really why it cracked but it did.<br />Very disappointed !
B00P2D41OQ|5|Installed these in my 2004 Ford F-150 FX4 in the cargo area light.  One of the bulbs went out so I decided to upgrade the bulbs instead of the whole unit.  I'm very happy with the light that they put out, it's much brighter and looks better than stock.  Make sure you put them in the right way if you are putting them into this application - at first I didn't think that they worked.  Glad I tried them the other way around!
B00CRR5LJY|5|Perfect fit, works well and was a great price.
B007R6A2PS|5|good price and fast shipper
B004Y9YJGY|4|A Good Deal!  A good rubber coating, and Best Of All, the effect was nicely even under my bike!  I always worry LEDs will look like little dots but, even using only One, it still gave the desired effect!<br />The less than perfect rating is because of the wiring...<br />Wires are Thin, less than 20 gauge, and Short, less than 12 inches...  this means you need to add extra length to them to put them on...  that being said, they still work well.
B0032J1KAK|5|I love these I have one on both mirrors.
B00LMQA5VU|1|Didn't fit
B00F5GVOX6|5|Very CUTE & nice size
B002SAT5CE|5|Easy to install and made my FJ breathe easy. Hardest part was taking off the old exhaust. If you're looking for sound then look elsewhere. This puppy is quiet, slightly more grunt than the stock exhaust but it's all about the airflow. The Shiny TRD tip exiting out the side is a nice touch. And no more exhaust drone like the factory POS had, overall it's a well engineered and exact fit for the FJ.
B000QR6XJ4|5|Pricey but better than any air freshener I've wasted my money on. One little squirt is all you need.
B00N6DEJWS|5|Excellent I will recommend this to my family and friends.
B00390X6DQ|3|Good product has been on-time delivery<br />Thank you،،،،
B00WOT3YM6|5|Very  good  condition  and very  fast  but  getting  hot  less  than  10 mine team anyway  I hope  get light  in the secret to see  in the  night  thinks  to be less  price  in the future
B00CYLKBUM|5|Love it!  I have three cats and needed something to keep cat hair off my car seat.  This works perfectly!  Thought the cats are never in the car, their hair gets on my clothes and then is transferred.  It holds its place on the seat nicely too.  Big thumbs up!
B000EDUUG2|5|Broom and dust pan that is portable. Where this is useful is your problem, for us, we use it in the car.
B003GZE4L2|5|Holds plenty of coolant probably keeps the car cooler. would recommend if your in the market for a new radiator
B000GRW9GU|4|good product it reduces the noise on my exhaust pipe
B00FSBW3GK|5|This fixed the issue of my auto door locks not working!
B000VKRQBA|5|A simple replacement for the cabin air filter at a better price.  What's not to love?
B009K5H6BW|5|part fit my application and works fine
B0041E21V2|3|The item seems to labor to make the window go up and down. It is satisfactory...
B001AMA6I8|5|Superior.  I demand more from my suspension than almost anyone (hauling heavy loads, traveling on bombed out streets, etc.) and these are the only shocks I have found that meet all my criteria.  They are excellent for a coil-over system, as they encourage a slow rebound of the spring.
B002R0LFS2|5|Plug-n-play once you can get to the connector.  Product same as oem thank you!
B000CFQ30O|5|Easy to install, and made a world of difference on my trailer hookup.
B000QGZXCS|5|I've been using this product for years
B008C0WXSW|5|Fits perfect
B008WXL0UQ|5|Bought this for a friend who's son has autism and she loved it.
B00IO8IO6W|5|This trunk cover fits my 2013 RAV4 LE perfectly. It took approx. 2 minutes to install and provides complete coverage of the trunk area. The clips that attach to the backseat headrest posts are easy to attach and remove. The cover retracts and slides into place with ease. The item was appropriately packaged arrived on time and without damage. I highly recommend this cover if you are looking to shield your cargo from prying eyes.Thank you.
B0017ZGMIQ|5|I've used them before and always very pleased with results.
B006LJALGM|5|Fit perfectly, thank you!
B000CPI5Z0|3|Not the best tasting sports drink I've had.  Very greasy and gave me lot's of gas
B00NEFUP3K|5|Excellent quality
B006CPMGEA|3|Does not work consistently and already the window button is stuck recessed in
B00Y2OYQVY|4|Great light on high beam, but on drl inappreciably blink! camry 2012
B002BHWZFI|1|Doesn't work as advertised, at least not in Florida.
B004Z1J6P0|5|Great replacement
B000CF6RX2|5|The installation was straight forward and as simple as can be. I have had them installed for about two months and have been through some pretty serious Texas rainstorms so far and let me tell you, they work very well. As good as your defrost is, there is nothing like being able to open the window a little bit when it is coming down like cats and dogs to equalize the temperature and humidty level, making driving in the rain a much more safe endeavor. Also, being able to leave the windows cracked a couple inches when it's hot outside and not having to worry about the errant rain cloud is a little slice of wonderful.<br /><br />Buy it, install it, and then wonder what took you so long to buy it in the first place.
B004SEVSCS|4|So far so good!
B000GD5FMY|3|These are great when am moving. Fog right up at a stop light had to get anti fog wipes
B001KOBGP8|5|Installed on 72 Honda.  Easy install and works well.  Great for the price.
B0012TR13W|5|Just what i needed got it sooner than estamated
B00CASDZKC|5|These are great Kick Mats. They look nice and are well made. Fast delivery too!
B007EGH4KM|4|The part seems to be reasonable quality.  The mounting holes lines up perfectly on my 2007 Mazda 3S.  They're quiet and seem sturdy so far.
B011VNB75Q|5|very useful I will purchase other products
B008D6YGE4|2|Doesn't fit most bikes I own and I would NOT recommend using it on a carbon fiber bike.  I can feel the carbon bending under the clamp.
B00GXXCP24|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B0002SRH7O|5|top buy
B00P9EJGR0|5|Excellent. we really like the product. Easy to install and works as advertized.
B006FUT154|1|Not really clear coat safe. Use will dull the finish. Directions say something about a satin finish, which means it will dull a gloss finish. Do not use this on a glossy clear coat.
B0026M3OX0|1|Crazy fit selector says this will fit my 64-67 chevelle.
B003VAWQYY|5|Works great.
B00PYZIZI0|4|installed without a problem<br />have not had a chance to actual use it yet
B0115Q1BPU|5|Plates are exactly as described, look good, and arrived quickly. I'm happy with them.
B0047DDDT6|5|The product is installed and works fine
B00AMNJBXW|4|Is this product sold in pair?<br />[[ASIN:B00AMNJBXW Dura International BR55125 Rear Solid Disc Brake Rotor]]
B009RUCK0C|2|These lasted less than a month. I replaced them with Phillips brand lights which are still going strong. I will not buy these again.
B000F2WYQG|5|In AZ this is a must for you vehicle, easy to install, looks great.
B00N2E3W42|1|The glass on one of the mirrors is not cut properly so it doesn't have the correct convex to see properly.
B000IOJKFY|5|What a great product. Very Easy to install and looks beautiful. Added so much power to my bike. Pipes got louder, pick up is faster, all around great investment. And of course the Butterfly's are awesome!
B008N3JHZU|5|On time delivery, and just what I needed for my 2005 Yamaha Zuma!
B00192JGA8|5|Great
B00M1VHPS6|5|East install, even having to reuse the Raptor pipe was super easy. Sounds great, slight echo at 70/75 but doesn't bother me. Super loud when cold!
B00J2OX3IQ|1|Wrong size for the recommended vehicle
B008XNZZ7O|5|Like this stuff. Clears the air and no heavy smells. I can't stand those that stink up the place like berrys or some kind of flower. This is almost oderless and cleans smells from the air ...
B00X34E5W4|5|This is a great product! Provided a very clean and professional looking finished look under the hood in a restoration project.
B0041C94TG|5|Use it all the time, very usefull
B0028JQYSS|4|Very good product
B008G3D08M|5|perfect fit!
B004GYKO9S|5|Arrived as advertised and in a timely manner.
B003X93N40|5|Worked perfectly; excellent; exceeded my expectations.
B002OPZHAM|5|Good product good price
B00HRFW9AU|5|Nice exellent
B00RSO17YO|5|Fits great. Same as mbrp for less money
B000C5SGA4|4|As advertised and install not too difficult. Made my CEL go off and that was the objective. Hardest part is getting the plastic snap-on plug to unsnap from your existing sensor
B00MKBU6A6|5|excelente
B007Z34WT0|5|Works great
B00W6IZJ3W|5|fast delivery and very easy to install
B00514BAHW|5|It was just what I wanted! Was a breeze to install! I would highly recommend it!
B00O7YCQ9S|2|One of the three came cracked and yellow backing was not fully applied to the magnet.  Two ere fine but disappointed for the 3rd one.
B00BRAVCSQ|5|Fits my '03 Corolla S. Love the look of a shorter antenna and made the car look more sporty.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Excellent product, especially when used with the leather conditioner.  Both are easy to apply and come with special applicators.  I used it on handbags and highly recommend it.
B004304C0W|5|So far this rug has lasted through the Spring and the summer. I ordered it to put in my gazebo, so it covers the ground inside of the gazebo and has had no problems with the weather and is holding up well. It also looks lovely. Read a couple of reviews that made me hesitate at first, but gave it a chance and I absolutely love it! It adds color to the inside set up of my gazebo as well.
B000BQKBP2|5|Did what is was designed to do, no leaks and a hose fitting to easily drain the gray water.  Extra nice feature was it has 4 locking tabs that mated up well with the 4 pins on the clear 90 degree elbow.
B00ODM4I90|5|These are heavy, thick rubber chocks. I use them on my car and trucks in the garage when lifting my vehicles while doing minor work and when doing my oil changes. These are just the right size for my vehicles (1/2 & 3/4 Ton trucks), store very well in the garage and loose their rubber smell quickly (at least mine did). I also use them on my trailers (horse and flat beds) as needed and they work very well.
B00IMMAXTG|5|Seemed fine.
B00MN92QI0|5|Looks great and good value
B007QEDV4U|4|Just as described.
B00DSD5ASS|5|This Sticker is on my vehicle and I love. I get compliments on it all the time!
B000EOKVII|5|4 years later - no issues.<br />Excellent quality.
B003PF7140|5|Was pleasantly surprised how easy this worked.  Good value here, don't hesitate to buy.
B007A9AA6S|5|Have to order a second pair.  Perfect summer pant.
B00TU3G9IA|5|cheaper than a set of gaskets and a primer bulb, bonus for the the main jet being accessible. Just what I needed.
B00LOYCIXI|5|Just what the door needed. Can't never have to many cup holders.
B000CONSUI|5|At first, I thought it wouldn't work because it had a different shape. But it fit fine !
B00DJ68KHW|1|I LOATHE this product!  This came recommended as a way to seal and then prime/epoxy the garage - NOT - DO NOT use this stuff!  It's meant to be applied alone and looks lovely but chipped, right away!  and NO ONE was walking in the garage.<br />Most importantly, no one warned us about the SMELL of this junk.  It smells AWFUL - so toxic, the fumes actually drifted up to our THIRD floor and I had headaches waiting for this stuff to dry - it's basically expensive paint and it total junk.
B00W67TC8Q|1|Ok everyone should be expecting Horley Davidson, but linkage is to short for my 1997 FXSTC Softail. Get what you pay for, should work on newer short rod bikes
B00BJ4EF0C|5|Work great on my 1997 ranger. Fix the sloppy shifter.
B00V9BU4YG|5|Very nice.i like them a lot.
B00480J4I2|5|It was the exact same light as in my Lexus just about 100.00 less. It was a pain to put in but I paid a neighborhood gas station mechanic to put it in, which he did in 30 seconds after 30 minute of me trying and scraping my hands up. The dealership wanted 150 to put it in. I was able to take it out but that, I must admit was not the easiest but was way easier than putting it back in.
B002Q2T4CU|5|This works well with the Petronix coil
B0010DZZQA|5|My car is running smooth
B005CLPSAO|4|Good item. It fits as advertised. Installation was easy once a video was found on how to install. Will see how long it will last.
B000C13PC2|5|good product excellent service
B007Q4MOGG|5|It worked just fine with my 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring
B000VB66WY|4|Perfect fit for my 02 Dakota
B002SAUS2A|4|nice little extra tie downs easy install. must have rail system installed
B000BZI1C8|5|PARTS are great price and performance
B00BSGRY5E|5|Love them!!
B001JSY9Q8|2|The springs that allow for coins to be stacked are crooked. Doesn't work very well.
B0052WR7PC|5|Took care of a erratic idle...
B002PUX528|5|Look great
B004WN83JG|5|Love it!
B006ZST9LW|3|IDK...I bought it for someone else...he hasn't said one way or another...?...??...???...!!!...BUT... I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT BUSINESS and PERFORMANCE WAS GOOD! God Bless Y'all!
B0000AY3DS|4|this is an amazing deal for the price<br />the quality isn't anything super amazing but fir the price the quality is spectacular
B0041FVE78|4|As expected
B000C40SFG|3|I got the KYB as I they should be better than the bargain shocks. Good price for what they are but they are no where near as heavy duty as the original shocks on my Ford Super Duty.
B00P6OJM9U|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B00BER2OPC|5|worked good
B00RKFQRE6|5|It was exactly what I needed & a easy fix. Works wonderfully.
B000FQ1Q4I|5|Worked great
B002MQFTLU|5|Loved the reasonable price.  Thanks.
B00BFXJBHY|5|Easy install and clean look..!!
B006FXGSOI|4|It arrived quickly, but my fog lights are already broken and I need to replace them before installing it.
B0048J6T4K|5|Very good quality product and fast shipping.
B000EDUTV8|2|this item does not come with the square nut thats just silly. Worked after getting 3/4 x 3/4 square nut.
B00029WYEY|4|works good
B00CIGLRLA|2|These are very light and cheep feeling. They get the job done, as long as my bike isn't vibrating (basically, when it's not running). The mirror itself is good and clear, and the price was right (in comparison to all other grossly overpriced options). They look decent at a glance. Aside from making every object behind me look like it badly needs to shave (if even visible at all), it's difficult to keep screws in the back at the right tension to keep the mirror from wherever it dang well pleases in the wind, while still being able to adjust it with one hand.
B00BITI7KM|4|The handle is just like the original and works fine. However, the little plastic clip that holds the wire that opens the door was installed upside (incorrectly) and couldn't clip on to hold it in place. I tried to get it off and turned around so that it would retain the wire like it is supposed to, but it broke - cheap. Luckily the nylon one on the original handle came off easily and I installed it. Now it works fine.
B012A6SB3E|5|This is a wonderful trailer lock! Much of the other reasonably priced locks I'd purchased before were't big enough to fit the lock on my trailer and/or were broken on arrival, but this one has satisfied me so far!
B00CLMBE5A|5|I was lucky enough to have the person in the parts department of my car's dealership recommend this hitch.  Strong and unobtrusive. Had professionally installed. I'm using to attach a bicycle rack. Fits perfect.  Company shipped promptly.  Would definitely recommend.
B0084UJJ78|5|These mudflaps look great on my '13 Silverado.  The rear ones are ridiculously easy to install, just hold in place and turn the locking ring.  The front ones are a little more difficult to install but not terrible.  You just have to remove a couple of the factory clips and replace with the provided hardware.
B003SZ80PG|3|First one I received was completely defective. The guide plate slide up and down the rail with no effort because there was no tension in the cables. The spool popped out of its holder and I had to reseat it. When I connected the regulator to the motor, the cable became snarled and horribly tangled. Amazon was good about sending a replacement.<br /><br />The replacement regulator had stiff cables with lots of tension, and only the motor could move the guide plate up and down as expected.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, drill/grind out the rivets holding down the speaker. #4 screws and bolts will work to hold the speaker, just don't forget to get washers. Two nitpicks: the harness clips that attach to the door need oval holes; these are round and will not fit. Use zip ties. The inspection gasket where you unscrew the window from the guide plate is also a completely different size and will not fit in the Dorman product. Fit is otherwise not an issue.<br /><br />To pop off the window from the guide plate, I ended up using a putty knife from behind the regulator (inside the door) and prying off there. I couldn't get it to come off any other way.
B003RF8VEC|1|Not impressed
B0041QX4ES|5|Fantastic best puller I have ever used. Built to last a lifetime!
B007SCN8A2|3|Ordered these for a 2005 Dodge Ram 2500.  The fronts fit ok; however, the fit for the back is less than desirable.  The passenger side does not sit in the floor panel very well and I think its a trip hazard for people getting in and out of the vehicle.  For $180 I am pretty disappointed in this product.
B00NA85P1S|5|These are the best replacement for a 1383 that I've used. The multiple LEDs give enough light for reading plus a good-looking &#34;old school&#34; spill for general illumination, unlike other 1383 replacements which have a narrower beam. They run cold, which is exactly what they should do. I bought five, and might even install a couple of extra fixtures just for these bulbs.<br /><br />If you want the frosted glass effect of the old incandescent 1383, just scuff up the clear plastic surface of the bulb with some 220 grit sandpaper. The plastic still passes the light, but you won't see the individual LEDs behind your handmade &#34;frosting&#34;. The reduced glare is easier on the eyes if you are looking at the spotlights from across the room.
B00AZPI0NE|4|Mounted on my tractor ROPs. Not sure how water got in the lamp, but lens has lots of moisture inside. Possibly via the hole in backside for wire?
B00L1S85DO|5|prompt delivery, pretty much what I expected
B009AA6Y1U|5|After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this for fear that it was not a quality product, however, I am happy that I pulled the trigger.  The quality is on par with the International version, which is $250-300 more expensive. The only real difference I noticed was the &#34;made in china&#34; stamp on the back of the y-collector.  I am not a mechanic, but I am fairly handy with tools, and I was able to complete the job in a saturday, while taking my time. The hardest part was getting the old bolts off the manifold, and i ended up cutting one off with a dremel. My up-pipes were pretty leaky (only able to build about 14 psi boost under WOT), and man what a difference with this product! I wrapped these with header tape instead of ceramic coating, and it is also MUCH quieter in the cab.  I did this in conjunction with a handful of other mods (ebpv delete pedestal and high flow outlet, hpx, frx, and banjo bolts), and i have a completely different truck.  The only caution I would give is, this is a VERY messy job. Even with the cleanest of trucks, expect to have your wife hose you off in the driveway when you are done. Also, leave the up pipes loosely connected to the manifold until after the turbo is installed, as it makes getting everything lined up in the tight space a breeze.  Overall, this is a quality product, almost indistinguishable from the more expensive part this is a replica of. Time will tell if it will hold up, but for the price, it was definitely worth it!
B0030EVL60|5|Easy to use and reliable. OTC  Products are the way to go. Nice storage case.
B007H2RGK6|5|Use this on all my customers boats and have never heard a negative comment about it. Leaves a great finish on all the upholstery and seems to do great protecting it.
B0091OE6K6|5|simple and works. Tired of my kid ducking the shoulder belt because it hit her neck. Now she has it adjusted to fit.
B00IJT10PI|5|90 days later, my son has adopted / inherited my full leather jacket, because I havent worn it since this arrived.  the first week I had it, did two rides with the hoodie in, definately bulkier that way, but as warm as my full leather.  since then, zipped out the liner, and well enough vented for riding in upstate ny, june july and august.  Oh, the &#34;concealed carry&#34; sewn in holster in the pocket....  maybe it's for Ruger LCP's or Derringers or something?  Sig P226's S&W MP9's, and Ruger SP101's didn't fit, but thats what real holsters are for anyway.
B003VAYMB4|4|Worked for the Calabria Pure Vert Ballast System.  I will agree with another review.  The product that came was only the electric motor and not the sliding valve.  That is what I needed, because my sliding valve was still good, but It would have been nice to have switched out everything.  I did have to alter the wiring a bit to fit my current electrical configuration.  But the product works well.  I first tried to replace with a Drain Master Valve and that valve worked when I first put it in, but then had issues.
B00G1IT86C|5|perfect1
B005G82C8E|5|This is so convenient!!! I live in phoenix AZ where the internal temperature of cars can bake cookies. literally look it up on YouTube. I hate fussing with all the sun shades putting them behind the seat where half the time you just don't use them. I looked at other styles of permanent sun shades but they all looked quite tacky. When I came across EZ shade I was concerned what they would look like installed but i ordered them anyway. They are very discreet when not out people who ride in my car don't even notice them till i park and pull them up. they provide 98% on the window of my 2013 dodge caravan and took less than 15 minutes to install and reduce the temperature in my car by a significant amount so there will be no burning seat or steering wheels for me or my children. I will order these for every one of my future cars.
B001MXH9FS|5|Fits perfectly in my old Shasta camper I'm renovating
B007KCXA58|5|Fit perfect and look great
B0009IBJAS|5|In use on a trolling motor battery and works great. It will take over a day or two to completely charge a battery with this unit, but as a battery maintainer it is working fine.
B007REFW32|4|It fit fine, but the color was not as bright as pictured. I get a lot of compliments on it though
B000CSNK84|5|These are great!
B000BUU5Z4|5|Very handy item to keep our toothbrushes out of the way but available in our travel trailer -- we plan to get one for home!
B00I2XRA5A|5|Last year my wife had a major stroke . We went to the sellers page  here on Amazon . We chose the make, model and year of our vehicle and they sent us the EXACT one that fit our '99' Ford Explorer , then we bought one for our '98' Chevy Tahoe  (that one also fits my daughter-in-laws '02' Chevy Cavalier ) This belt extender  is so Awesome! My wife is now able to buckle and unbuckle herself . which to her is a really big push towards independence . we could not be anymore pleased with this product.
B000CDRJ9U|5|Received quickly and anxious to try on our upcoming trip.
B002EP11GG|5|thank you fit fits
B00DLMGJWW|5|Love the look and easy to install.
B001UEHLZW|5|Just what I needed, fits perfectly and is listed by seller correctly. Some that I saw on line were not. Thank you for a smooth transaction.
B004BCHOVG|5|perfect fit fast shipping
B002QH6N0G|5|Just what my truck/camper needed.  Huge difference in handling.
B00WOXP3Q2|4|So far so good
B004K6YN8U|5|snrytgnsrnryt
B001P2HWC6|5|This works fantastic.  I use it to transport our kayaks. I am unable to lift the kayak to the roof, so this was the next best alternative, and as it turns out, better than I even thought when I was ordering it.<br />Someone saw mine and went and bought one too, after seeing how great it is.<br /><br />The quality is there. It does shake a bit up top, so we just put some tie downs on each side and it keeps it silent and more stable.<br />This is very easy to put on and take off the truck. Highly recommend it!
B009SIO9Q6|5|workes perfect, easy to install on 2001 jeep wrangler, good price
B00DW4MB5S|5|very good
B00V9ZNHWI|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Gives off plenty of light.  Great product for the price.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|great gauge!!  good quality and easy to use.
B007XC475M|4|normal
B000CLJFA8|5|fit great
B00F9RNIPI|5|The cables are good quality and delivery was on time - what more can you ask for?
B0085KGOH0|4|Wish it came with a hose.....or two.
B002UJVNFA|3|These glasses are a nice replacement vs goggles. The foam face padding is crooked on every one, but worth the price!
B00BGJBMC4|5|bought these for the running lights on my RV.......really great  highly recommend
B00SXEQF8G|4|Great cover for the money, goes on and comes off in seconds.  Only drawback is the cord clasp slips and doesn't hold the cinch cord tight.
B004RCOUP8|5|A+
B00BI3WLHS|4|Gives me a good chuckle
B009KYYUJE|4|works well, so far so good, although pricey
B000C0WLSM|4|shipped quick ,right part and right price
B00KTHZ8CY|5|The electronics fit perfectly in the key case and after having the key cut it works just like the original.
B00KQ7WDZW|5|NICE AND STURDY
B0024E6W02|5|As described and delivered as stated
B00NR9WVJ4|5|Excellent product. The Precut vinyl tint arrived just as described and was very easy to install. Thanks
B003TTV972|5|Best racing jugs out there.  I wish I would have done all white, but both work great.  If you've used &#34;other&#34; brands, the threads on the caps were never good.  The VP threads are fantastic and give you a solid seal every time.
B003TQ4DOQ|5|It was a breeze to install
B00N54BEM6|5|Works great on my 2015 Corvette C7 Zo6. Install is a bit tricky because of how the airbox is mounted but nothing to the install really. Seems that the air filter has taken away some of the throttle lag off idle. No idea if it gave any true power increases since no before and after dyno runs. Sure something was added though since you can feel as if the car is moving quicker.
B000FAKIR0|5|These mats are the best since they have the University of Alabama's logo.  Roll Tide!
B00SX5RSA4|5|These worked perfectly for the NON-Strut rear springs in my 2007 Merc Grand Marquis. I felt safe the whole time using them and they didn't let me down. I will be using them for the actual struts in the front in a few weeks, and then again for all 4 of our other vehicles springs as well. I will update this review after I've done all 8 springs between the 2 vehicles.
B003U4TL3U|1|after you finish pumping fluid still drains out the end leaving a mess on the floor.
B00171V1WC|2|Disappointing.  After just a few weeks these are already not making contact across the entire windshield and not cleaning all of the solution of the windshield.  For the price I paid I expected better.  Will look towards an OEM next time.
B00AOHBCJW|5|WORKED GREAT IN MY HONDA!
B006N91C2M|5|Ordered this battery because we were camping and our car died. Closest auto part store was 60+ miles away, but we had internet signal so we had it shipped to the cabin.  2 days later, the battery arrived.  We put it in and the car has run perfectly ever since.  Great battery!
B00K889FCI|1|Yuck, I used the tiny little square (1&#34;x1&#34;) to rub and buff my headlights for 30 minutes.  What a ridiculous pain in the rear.  Not worth the time or elbow grease, I would definitely try a solution that uses a drill to buff next time.
B003M0WRIS|1|This is not so called &#34;HID&#34; headlights as advertised.  My regular halogen light bulbs are brighter than these bulbs.  the only difference between these &#34;HID&#34; and the halogens is that it is white light, but not the same &#34;HID&#34; headlights quality.  Very disappointed that i brought these light bulbs.  Very Unsatisfied Customer.  Will never buy from these people again.
B00IN4IUZW|5|These are perfect OEM for the Scion, well worth the money!  I did not paint mine either because I have a white TC and they look great unpainted and the plastic is very shinny and will look good.  I may paint them if the finish wears soon.
B004KEFCPU|2|I'm sure this will work fine on some vehicles, but on mine, the pins are too big on one side, and too small on the other.  Also, in order for the pins to fit the holes on the A/C Clutch on my car (2000 Dodge Durango, 5.9L), the tightening screws overlap the hole, which prevents me from fitting the socket through.
B00ZWMDE3G|5|excellentexcellent
B00L4V9ECY|5|Easy to use
B0022ZXO40|5|Have this strapped to the seat of my motorcycle, works great for holding down gear; helmets, jackets, boots, etc.
B00GS9ENAK|4|Took some shoving to get it in. It certainly is not a perfect fit.  Just a generic fit cheap replacement.
B0001EFSTI|3|has the potential to fall off the key chain
B00F9VNEWQ|5|Exact look I wanted. The installation on my 2005 Wrangler was less than a minute.
B0010GDGFY|5|great
B003JLDQNK|4|The bag is smaller than dimensions given indicate (I think the dimensions maybe for outside) and not big enought to fit a laptop. Otherwise, it looks like it's sturdy and well-made. It's relatively heavy and bulky, and you have to pay for return shipping to 3rd party vendor, which set me back 27 dollars since I didn't realize that.
B00NJRL1KY|3|was hard to get it to stick to the window
B00R3A6IX8|5|Arrived on time and as described. Quick and easy install, around 30 minutes each side.
B00SZZKU02|5|i just have to complete a few more things and she will do what is exspected!!!
B003CK3QJW|5|Used on a 2004 KLR650.  No issues with installation, simple packaging.  Timely arrival.
B00J3NSZ0M|5|absolutely fantastic, much cheaper than other brands and brighter than most.<br />I did have to do som modification to the connection to make it work on my 2010 Jeep wrangler, but it was a very simple procedure
B001TI5IIQ|5|I was really desperate before getting this item and totally uncertain of how this was going to help me and it totally did.  I was ready to get new headlights and for now I don't have to.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Works great! Much better than other tire pressure gauges I'd tried in the past. I love that it's purely mechanical - no batteries needed, and less likely to break.
B008ET00ZO|5|Use with distilled water as per manufacturer recommendations
B000EDQR32|3|Too much money for what it is. Buy the $4 one from the dollar store or Meijer.
B004NBO9Q8|2|Pump did not read gas level. Took apart and found the pump was broken in two pieces. Mechanic was shocked it worked at all. Now I am waiting on another replacement tank... Labor costs just doubled
B001CF3JFA|5|It was good for the 37 inch tires I have.  Heavy duty.
B000F3RYGA|4|I have a big camper and I couldn't find anything big enough to fit over a standard bumper pull camper.  My camper is 26-28 feet long with a big  trailer hitch as it normally should be.  The little yellow universal trailer hitched locks that you can pick up at wally world will not fit over the ball/hitch receiver.  So, I looked about the small little mining town of Elko Nevada and not to my surprise couldn't find any.  I figured I might find one or two at three times the cost, but nothing.  This trimax UMAX50 works like a champ.  It fits and it noticeable.  Again it is NOTICABLE and present.  Yes, I am sure that it could be broken off with a wedge bar, a torch and hammer or maybe a big sledge attaché to a big criminal, BUT seriously it is a small inexpensive deterrent.  It is sturdy and it look sturdy.  I worry about someone taking my camper when I park it or tow it and even leave it my yard.  I just hope that the criminal mind is slightly swayed in looking for another camper to steal - you never know, but stealing is a crime and sometimes people commit crimes.  It looks bold, it feels bold and it is the first LINE of defense!
B00DQRSK9C|5|Wonderful
B00G6KGPFM|5|Excellent product with fast ship.
B007GR4MOA|4|Looks great, works well. A few spots missing, but not noticeable from the outside
B000JFO1K6|5|Cool little addition to your boring trailer hitch...
B006RJUJ4K|5|matches my jeep
B00Q3YRB6S|5|Great tool, great price!
B000C9S6C8|5|OEM replacement.  Fit nice and snug!
B007H2SL1Y|5|A+
B001KQAAI0|5|Very good
B000GZKTA0|2|Its on my bike and working...but it is an inferior product.  Key turns past what it is suppossed to, and key will not come out of switch now.
B011F9PJB4|5|Thank you
B006QQVR7M|5|2-3 weeks after I installed these bumper pods I hydroplaned a 360° on a very busy road into guard rails.  This bumper hit the rail, got a nice dent but stopped my jeep from continuing and rolling. I'm VERY satisfied with the product.
B00SLK3V7U|2|It may be my fault because I didn't read all the details throughly, but the company had good stuff, shipping came in a timely manner, I just  thought I was getting a complete remote, instead of the shell
B004QQCZ34|4|So far very nice.  Only a few hundred miles.
B00GSQ8MSC|4|I use Castrol GTX in all of my vehicles and have never had an issue. This goes in my wife's mini-van and the Syntec goes in my Subaru.
B00THR39SC|5|Great product for the $
B00HB9KX82|4|We thought it would be a little wider, but we like it
B0002JMV06|5|installed with filter disconnect tool once you find the filter and access the location it is an easy fix.
B00J5AAX5S|5|WOW, mounted these inside the factory Jeep JKU rear bumper and man are they bright!
B00RI8PWTG|5|superb quality - great buy for the price.
B00HFFNVT0|1|I was putting this on my JDM gsr and it cracked when I try to install it not only that it had a gap in the middle of it :( just stick to the OEM parts of you know what's good for you
B004IQD95K|5|works great.
B00TEG2NJC|5|The order came quick and the quality is excellent.
B00RNISZM2|4|Very nice for the price
B007HSM7KE|5|The greatest.  Saved me from a speeding ticket
B00NY5O91O|5|simple retrofit, nice color red my wife loved it, and now she know which key is hers!
B000K7JE3C|5|The quality is outstanding. comfort, ride and look are perfect! It also doesnt raise the seat height at all - if you are under 5'10&#34; and ride and ST1300 - this will be extremely important to you - most other after market seats will RAISE the seat height - so beware!!!
B00IO12YZQ|5|love these lights.. adds better look to my show truck and diffidently worth more than they are sold for... id buy these for all my trucks
B00IF6DYEU|5|happy
B00VVFGTFS|5|Worked as specified, delivered on time, cheapest price on the market and believe me I looked.
B000MDB6EY|5|great for looking like Riddick.
B00199BO4C|4|in works
B006GJYOL0|5|Like this product.  First application took off most of the water spots.  Looking forward to additional applications to see if all the water spots will fade away. Had previously used a mix a white vinegar and water, this time following a wipe down with Hot Sauce, the boat was left clean with a nice shine.  Also purchased the Conditioning Sauce for the upholstery, nice product as well.
B003N9MQCK|5|Great price, fast shipping, extremely pleased  with purchase and seller.
B00HRSS6TK|5|The part did the trick and works fine.
B007RXBTI0|4|It would be perfect if the sides were at a 90deg angle They are slightly angled but I just had to modify my project. Luckily I bought the drip pan before I built my cabinet
B008F5RTYC|5|excelent
B008SGM3ZS|5|As shown, my daugter loves it
B0012TTAIQ|5|Worked great for what I did. Still keeps it quiet.
B007GMHTQ8|2|As another reviewer stated, this product rusts. One use and rust was dripping and drying all over the roof of my vehicle.
B005HE1I8M|5|Perfect
B00FKQCWSM|5|Product Works Good... No More Over Heating Worries... Fast Shipping... Product As Described... A+++
B000C5UF26|5|Bought this for a Nissan 240sx. fits both KA24E and KA24DE engines.<br />I have this on my car, and got another one for a friend going for a smog.<br />He noticed his engine running a little healthier and better gas mileage.<br /><br />I always trust Denso. One of the closest you can get to Nissan OEM.<br />Sometimes costs a little more than others, but can't go wrong with it.
B0006SH4PU|5|love this product on cars
B00RF81IM4|5|Great lights arrived quickly
B00HQYTUYA|5|We use on a boat tarp
B00192JFI6|4|a little difficult to install
B00L40ZQGS|3|I bought this for my daughter to keep in her car since her A/C broke.  It works decently but be aware it doesn't cool the air, just blows the warm air around.
B00K1N43R2|2|It didn't work on my car. My bad for not checking it out. The product itself arrived in good condition and seems to be of great quality.
B000EVWDAK|5|Had a pretty good idea as to the problem but the code reader led me straight to it!
B0006JLSNI|5|This is another must have for RVers.  I picked up a couple different length water hoses for my RV.  I figured a 10' and 25' long hose should take care of me in any situation with my set-up.  Add to it I did pick-up a couple end caps for the hoses to prevent little crawlies from getting in the hoses when not in use and a water regulator to prevent a burst hose.
B0002SA5GY|5|looks great, very hard to install. you will need pliers or you will lose your fingers... but once on, they look great!
B00U2AECPW|5|Great price and service
B00FDQPCR2|3|other than sensor distance, not as advertise, also the control for length on time on as sensor is minimal. Would have like to have a choice of time on vs what's provided.
B0006IX87S|4|I like this inline water filter for my RV.  Lets face it city water typically has a taste, odor, or color which may make it undrinkable or at the bare minimum questionable.  This little guy does a good job filtering most all those elements out when you come to unfamiliar water  district.  A simple screw on connection attaches it to the hose and RV.  I know growing up and RVing in the 70s through middle 80s aspreteen and teen we always carried our drinking water in in separate 1 or 2.5 gallon water containers.  Which meant after a few days we were hitting the store for bottled water and this was not a common item back then.  If something like this was readily available back then it would have made a few trips much better.
B003BZLAKU|4|heavy duty
B00KPWB8DG|5|Easy to install rugged and look great on my jeep.
B00BTL9ZJG|5|fits perfectly!
B0046XITK0|3|No instructions in package or on website, very difficult to bleed and keep bled
B003RITZNA|5|ive had a nexx helmet for years now and like it alot  now i bought the same for my wife and she  likes it alot
B00G620ZVU|5|Awesome lights. Super broght and can take a beating.
B00RC9NH2K|4|FITS WELL AND WORKS FINE AT KEEPING LEAVES, PINENEEDLES AND BIRD MESSES OFF OF  MY CAR!!!!!!!!!!
B00A66GYDA|4|It work  fine with no problems.......
B007HRTM94|3|the bobbin was wrong had to buy from Winnabago but the rest of it I used not sure how much info was usable on CD
B000M5YYIW|5|My wife looked at me like I was crazy when these cotter pins arrived.  She was like &#34;Uh... there wasn't a smaller quantity available?&#34;  Well, of course there was!  But for the price, I thought to myself &#34;What the hay?&#34;  Well, let me tell you... these have really come in handy on my '69 Skylark project build.  I've been redoing the front suspension and brakes, and I've been shocked at how many of these cotter pins I've needed!  I don't know if new cars have a bunch, but my old one sure does.  Several different sizes, which makes it nice.  They seem sturdy enough.  Will I ever need 555 of them?  haha... Maybe not, but I'll never run out!
B009FU6WOO|1|Great shocks but mine only lasted about 15000 miles. I am having to process the lifetime warranty through Bilstein due to the fact that custompartsdepot is giving me nothing less than a hassle trying to get new shocks.. I will never buy from them again
B003SG7PU6|4|I received my seat covers on Saturday 8/292015, when I opened the package I was expecting them to be simple to put on without the ties. The color is nice and the texture is great! I was looking for the back seat covers to be one whole piece. Any way I took the time to follow the video and the video simplified my complexity; the task was not that complicated at all. Bottom line I like my new seat covers.
B00B4KTH90|4|Nice quality replacement and it installed with no problems. I only gave it 4 stars for the poor thin box that arrived with holes and damage to it. Very lucky the item wasn't broker where clips broke through the box.
B00DSCZ4AI|5|Shipping was fast. Few days and it was at my doorstep.<br /><br />The product was easy to install. About 5 minutes tops. Would recommend to anyone. Thanks guys.
B00FFAX7MI|5|They are what they say they are. No tricks or quirks that I've found.
B0090DXBEK|5|Perfect OEM replacement.
B00N3P5234|5|charges as it should!
B00IP3GHR4|5|Exactly as advertised.
B0002NIJOO|5|Love them just wish they made matching ones for the back to.
B00ODG7JQK|5|Works great
B00KPZECVI|5|Good deal! Saved a lot of Money!
B00M7X9874|5|Exactly what I needed, at a great price.
B00RKKQWV4|1|Shipping was fast but it didn't not fit my 04 jeep liberty. False advertising.
B00538FQV2|5|Bought this for my teenage son - and he loves it.
B00N2CXUDC|3|Really nice product to work with and it looked good. The issue I have is that the reflective side is very flimsy. It wasn't long before that reflective film started to peel away. So now there are areas where the white fiberglass mesh is exposed. Luckily for me, I wrapped my pipes and then put the heat shields back on. The blemishes aren't as noticeable.
B011AWQU28|4|I've seen more expensive head units bit this was good for the price. GPS works great, Bluetooth is good, always reconnects to my phone when I enter the vehicle. Sound much better than the factory unit which didn't sound bad at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the bad service I got. I payed for overnight shipping and received the wrong unit. I have an e46 and the unit I received was for an e39. It was too big for my dash. After writing to the company to get a replacement I was told there was &#34;no way the wrong unit was sent&#34; and that I &#34;thought&#34; it was wrong. I was talked to as if I was stupid and didn't know what I was talking about. I've replaced factory units in other cars I've owned. But after waiting another 3 days they sent the right unit. Defeated the purpose of paying overnight shipping.
B000C53RV2|4|Nice shocks nice ride lifted ride height a bit
B003FFTFBW|1|received two and both damaged.
B00EMELS9C|5|loved them. they've been on for 6 months already and still look like brand new.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Thanks
B00YGJE7FK|4|I received a discount on these window shades for givin my honest opinion and overall I'd have to give them four out of five stars. Installing them was pretty simple (I like that there are several options in case something doesn't work with your particular window). We installed them in two SUVs (one in each for where our daughter's car seat sits) and the size was perfect (Xterra and Jeep). They block the sun and add a little privacy if I need to nurse her. The only reason I give four out of five stars is because the buttons to roll them back up is pretty tiny and a little hard to press (which might be so a little person doesn't accidentally do it but I found it difficult whereas my husband didn't have any problems at all). Overall these are great sunshades and I'm really happy with our purchase.
B000C8ZJOM|5|Thanks
B00NID5MDG|5|This scanner has found fault codes I didn't even know my cars were throwing. I have other scanners that can read and clear generic faults, but the VW/Audi specific list is out of bounds for them. This scanner reads them all. Be prepared for it to take about 20 minutes to scan/find all of the different modules in a modern car. The scanner firmware was easily updated on the internet, all stored on the micro SD. You'll need an All in One card reader for your computer and a micro SD adapter in order to update (not included). The menus are fairly intuitive and you can save the fault codes to memory for later lookup and printout.
B00JLJOBJC|2|It only worked for a year and then it broke. Fan speeds 2 and 3 don't work anymore.
B003CJKO8Y|5|Fit perfect
B0002JM9NU|1|Bucket came smashed next to my fever tree tonic water
B0098M5LUK|5|Quality product, decent price.
B00AAZJF4C|5|Excellent product and quick delivery.  Exact replacement for my Ion Explorer Block Rocker
B00THR39SC|5|With recently purchasing a new truck, a 2003 Chevy Silverado 1500 Z71, I noticed that it definitely needed fenders. These are great, as they already have the pre-drilled holes, and the two sided tape that helps them stick better. They are very easy to install yourself, and for someone who is looking to improve their truck on a budget, this is one good investment. I did receive these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
B00DX87IWE|5|Ok
B00VQSA6RM|5|Product was great, and was received as indicated. Very pleased with the wheel covers. Installation was a bit tricky, but after the first one, the rest only took about 15 mins. I am very satisfied, and would buy this product again. Thanks very much for making and selling this great product.
B0012Q4H96|5|Great fit for my taco
B0066TJIT8|5|Great item! Its cheap and it works very well.
B000MINXX6|5|Cheap price, functional and what I expected.
B00471JQJE|5|Perfect fit to my CURT bike rack
B008DYZ730|5|Perfect fit
B00439Q05S|5|Works great, took a few hours to connect, figuring out the wires to connect to so it would unlock with the passenger door lock. Then figuring out how to work all the wiring into either existing harness or run new wire loom and tie it up securely.
B00M49RSNC|5|Perfect for 41mm shock tubes no play or improper fit, powder coated finish, made of aluminium which is soft, I needed to drill a hole for a fitting and it threaded very nicely, adjustable length is nice gives my street bike a very slim look A++
B00KULEN3E|1|Put in my make of car and it said it definitely fit my car. WRONG!! Now I can't even return them. Do NOT buy parts on this site!
B006BE1R8I|5|Worked as advertised.
B000C2WKBI|5|Brought it to my mechanic to install and it worked as expected. Pretty straightforward.
B004BC9ABS|4|ok
B005FG28K4|5|Works great
B00GSGKB5Y|5|Nice and good quality Thanks
B0039XNTWG|5|Just what I needed.
B000E28MTA|5|As always, another great product from K&N! Perfect fit, materials, chrome and as expected, performance! Would definitely recommend!
B004HFDGWS|5|'Muhrica
B00KFZXX3Q|1|Nothing like publicly displaying your racism.
B0028PJ10K|5|I purchased these for our living quarter horse trailer.  We have had these for about 6 years +/- and they work GREAT!!  We haven't had any break.  They can have a problem with sinking in small loose gravel but other then that they are great.  Did not know they had the top caps which might be a good idea to some of them.
B0018EAKFM|3|I bought these a few months ago for my husband, a big Chicago Bears fan. They are big and can fit in a variety of vehicles. They are good when you have dirty shoes, to protect the carpeting in the car or truck. They looks nice too. I'm glad I waited to review them, however, because we noticed that there is a bit of bubbling, like a warped area near the letter C. I'm guessing this happened because of the intense heat from the summer in Texas. Not very happy that this is happening. Luckily it's only a small area, but what if it gets worse?
B0048EA6GM|5|it fit perfectly! I love it!
B00EDY7DUY|5|really fun, great sticker and easy purchase
B002EDTOGC|5|Perfect fit.  Great price.  10 Minutes to install made for a great facelift.  Hopefully these will last as long as the OEM's and it will time to get another vehicle.
B00DD0CMU0|1|Lights are not very bright at all. Only a single led only visible at night, didn't even run them. Connected to power then chose different lights because these just wouldn't cut it as a blinker or marker. Not worth your time or money
B00IUV7PFO|5|Excellent
B005G3XFW6|5|Due to the size of the sticker the details are a little small to read. If you are planning on using it on a vehicle it may be hard to see what the permit is for however if you are using it on say a notebook the sticker is nicely detailed. I purchased it for Christmas for my husband as a stocking stuffer and he loved it!
B0097DIEWC|2|I'm not sure why I haven't read reviews about the screeching, whistling, unbearable noise coming off this thing but it's a little ridiculous a product would be designed so poorly.  If you look in the picture, the channel is covered completely all the way across, this is NOT the case with the kit. You get (4) small pieces to cover each end and that's it, the entire center is left open making for a nice tornado/freight train sound when you're going down the road (at 35 - haven't even made it above 55 yet - I'm afraid I might summon a pack of dogs or a group of angry Vikings with this thing)  I've got gorilla tape over the channel right now. You can buy the extra strips at $5+ a piece, it would seem you'll need (8) total: (4) cover the back top channel, plus (1) for each corner to cut and cover the bottom of the channel that's open on either side of the legs.  But why should I HAVE to do that?!?  Just call it an even $400 and give people what they need to complete the kit!!!!<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a bit misleading to put a picture of a completely covered channel but send something different.  I also found it a little frustrating that none of the reviews I read dealt with the noise issue. I would've never bought this thing had I known.
B004ZF39T0|5|Great hid kit and cool reusable box. One bulb came broken and Amazon sent me a whole other kit. Works great!
B008JYXYNY|2|I bought this for my wife, but she can't reach over her shoulder to clamp this adjuster in place.
B00MI5YLEG|5|Fast delivery, works perfect
B004UVIQ2E|4|I did a lot of research on floor mats before buying these, which was loads of fun, let me tell you. Who knew they were so expensive? Unless you're OK with cheapo &#34;universal fit&#34; carpet ones. But I wanted some tough, rubbery mats that would last a while and were cut specifically for my car. The handy tool at the top of the screen said these were just right for my car, and the price was better than many places I'd seen, so I went for it. Well, they appear tough, and sturdy, and it seems they will be easy to hose off when dirty. They don't exactly fit my car perfectly though, which was disappointing. They aren't terribly misfitted, but they had to kind of be bent and forced and squeezed in, especially in the back seat. It appears I could cut some off and they'd fit much better, but the whole point in not ordering &#34;universal&#34; or &#34;cut to fit&#34; mats was so I wouldn't have to do that. I managed to wedge them in there without cutting but I wish they fit just right as I thought they would. Overall, I'm satisfied, as they will do their main job of keeping my floors protected. I paid sixty bucks and I see now they're priced way higher (I guess it fluctuates as many things to on this site) but I would not be OK paying any more than what I did, and really feel that I should have paid less.
B003KFQ2CM|5|Item as described, pretty cool that it holds a quart bottle in the funnel
B006WQSXSW|5|Great product
B0031I2SKS|1|They fit ....but not what I thought I was getting<br />Rotor hats and fins not powder coated  as shown
B008LY1LSW|5|Exactly what we needed to fix our lawnmower.
B000JFJLP6|5|Jump started 3 times and still does not need a recharge. Can keep the unit plugged in. Real happy with this
B00EEGJ7LY|5|Easy and perfect fit, lowered cab wind noise as a bonus.
B002QSHIEU|5|Great price on a pretty good piece of gear.  It has worked well so far with my FJ.
B00P1PNWEK|4|Great quality and easy to install.
B000JFJLP6|1|I decided to purchase this item base own the reviews..I only use it 4 times and now it won't charge..when I plug it up the charge complete like comes right on and not the charging status light..and of course I'm way pass the warranty...
B004PQQTRI|1|RV Awning shade kit 8 x 13 was returned to vendor.  It had a big flaw in the screen as well as one hole.  The quality of the sunscreen was cheap, unlike many we have bought in Arizona.
B000BYB3E2|5|These were an easy install and replaced an older version of these same wires I installed 5 years ago. Easy of, easy on, fit well, and work perfectly.
B00QK5QRBA|4|It installed really easily. I like the feel of the material. The gear shift pattern is not easy to see, but it doesn't matter since I've had the truck for so long, I don't need it.
B00KS5JJ4A|5|Expensive but worth every penny
B00LBMXSZK|3|I am only posting this &#34;review&#34; as information in regards to fitting. According to the RAM website, this kit is supposed to fit the 19mm stem of a Honda VFR1200. The rubber expansion plug at it's thickest point on the tapered portion is only 18mm in diameter. Then it jumps to 20mm  at the top in a cylindrical shape. Unless you want to shave the hard rubber and make it fit that way, I would not recommend this mounting solution.<br /><br />http://www.rammount.com/part/RAM-B-176-A-UN7#description<br /><br />The rest of kit (ball, arm, and x-Grip) appear to be fine, but I will have to fab up something else for the stem mount.
B001AVW0B0|4|Perfect for my TW200.
B002HXY6F8|5|good job,good item.thanks
B00NEL6HT0|5|Great
B000BRQ0TW|1|Did not work for me on a 3 in pipe with a leak smaller than a pin hole.
B00BTSHNNO|3|Bought March 2015 and it died on August 28th.  Will not power on.<br />Was OK while it worked.  The 3 stars are for when it was working.
B00E0VDBHO|5|great
B001MYU9PE|4|this charger charged the weak batteries that i had sitting around. it is smart enough to let you know if the battery is beyond recharging, in other words shot. it has a lot of user selections that arent all that helpful but a lot that are. it gives you choices for different type of batteries. the auto function does work pretty good. too bad that the fan is on all the time that it is charging. maybe a low speed when it is in maintenance mode would have been helpful if now quieter. the instructions tell you everything that you need to know but you have to read all of them to find out anything. all of this is based on a few days of use. if i can keep this one dry it probably will do what it is designed to do.
B000ALG86E|5|Great product!
B00DHJ071S|5|Great
B00WDSVEE8|5|Very satisfied and would recommend
B0002SRCKG|5|Worked great
B00ZR4324K|5|work on my 2000 wrangler
B002IVCNI6|5|GREAT
B000N4UQL6|5|Thanks
B00MYA6AXA|5|Took about an hour to put on, but worth it. They look great, almost custom looking.
B002I0GYZU|5|OEM sparks are good.  Pre-gapped but I did check them all just to be sure.  They were all gapped properly.
B007W4KJV2|5|This is a must buy.  I recently lifted my 2012 jeep wrangler unlimited  4 inches and running 33x12.5 tires. This setup dropped my mpg to 14.3 from 17.5. After only running about 70 miles my mpg without reseting it has increased to 16.5 mpg. There is also an increase in power. To keep my jeep at 65 I had to be at 2700rpm, but now purrs along at 80mph with 2200rpm. There is no more lag or holding the jeep back due to lack of power. 0-60 is also very impressive.  With only pushing to 4500rpm I get it about 8.8sec. This could be a little quicker if I'd push to the 6000rpm range, but no need to blow anything.  This is all with the 87 octain setting. I'm looking forward to trying the crawl setting soon. The increase torque should help those problem areas.
B00AGJI7HI|2|Easy to install but the main bar sits under the truck so the only part to truly step on is the added steps. This is not how other bars are designed and I wish I knew that before I bought this. My pregnant wife has a really hard time getting out because of the placement so she no longer rides in my vehicle.
B000FQ7DV8|4|Worked as advertised.
B004OHOKLU|5|Great fit
B00KJ0DUP8|4|Mirrors are really nice for the price. They made a significant improvement in ability to monitor vehicles in other lanes over my non-tow factory mirrors. Installed them on my 08 F150 Larriat. It was all plug and play. Everything works, including the puddle lights.<br /><br />I dinged a star due to no instructions or parer work of any kind was included in the factory sealed packaging. Required stopping to go look up install procedures on the web.
B0030634X6|5|Love them....
B00RIUP8VQ|5|Good deal. Fit my 2007 Camry perfectly.
B00MCE39D2|5|easy to install, looks great, good quality!
B00XQ0060K|5|Good standard lugs. These have the smaller 3/4&#34;-19mm drive so you can use a smaller socket for greater clearance on tight aftermarket wheels.
B003SKDGEQ|5|The Husky Liners work great on our New Ford F250 Pickup, they help keep the mud contained, off the running boards, etc.<br />a GREAT PRODUCT.....
B0002SA3UW|5|Fits perfectly
B00VODUWVY|5|Great and efficient supplyer...
B00P0YC6KS|5|Very happy with this pack. Doesn't move around on the back at all. Put in on an after a few minutes I forget its there. Its not much bigger than the A3 (I have both), but holds a liter more of liquid and has A LOT more storage. Don't expect to carry any bulky items though, this bag is designed to stay close to your back and be low profile. With that in mind, there is lots of room for tools, pump, spare tube, a bag of trail mix, a few bananas, phone, etc. You aren't fitting a jacket in there (maybe a spare t shirt), but then again Leatt/USWE have bigger bags to accommodate. Its perfect for a longer ride where I need lots of water and lots of snacks. The bladder itself is quality. Easy to wash, the quick disconnect is a great feature, and the bite valve works well. Can't recommend this bag enough.
B00S8JLA54|3|Have yet to install item.
B000C9D89O|4|Seems to be working just fine
B004QPCLC0|5|I love these speakers. I replace the crappy ones that Toyota had in my car. The speakers arrived in a timely manner and were easy to install.
B00BVQ5XFO|5|Worked just fine in my truck.
B00BFLW6HS|5|Great battery for the price, delivered to my door, hard to beat Amazon.  I expect it to work for years on my Honda Nighthawk 750.
B00UADG1WI|5|fast shipping  great,  Item arrived and fits good. thanks !!!!!!!!
B004BTEJLM|1|Baught this against  my machine shops advice n he was right.  Brand new motor sounded like I had a rod rap plus sounded like a empty power steering pump..  Junk spend the money buy a Pete Jackson!!!
B003ZLU33U|5|Fits perfect in my 04 chevy silverado, fast shipping!
B008DNC7KW|5|Nice
B00O2R3UAY|4|If put on the rear they cover up renual stickers
B0030HUFC8|5|Matches the Mercury gauges on my '98 Boston Whaler Montauk
B004BFZBJ0|5|Perfect ! Bolted right in spun the motor like crazy ! Glad I got it
B0063GQP6S|5|Very easy to install. The most time consuming part is cleaning the rubber from the bearing. I recommend a Dremel to cut the bracket and then clean the rubber with, also a razor blade with the handle used to take stickers of windows to clean off the remaining bit. Quite a ingenious design.
B000W7K588|5|The magnet makes this a lot easier to use.
B004QDAIUY|5|Super easy to install, looks great, and works perfectly.
B00I82CXAM|5|Fast shipping and exactly as described. Customer was very happy.
B00SSFGDXW|5|Will look good when I install them
B00MBQS86O|5|great
B00ASKRKQY|5|Sturdy
B00CIXID2Y|5|This product was exactly as described by other reviewers: it looks great, the directions are pretty much useless; the rear set is a &#34;no brainier&#34; to install -- but the front set is a bit more of an adventure.  Although they are not that difficult to install, in order to do so, you first need to pry off a factory installed molding, which is not for the faint of heart, because it mostly involves breaking these green plastic clips that holds it and they are surprisingly uncooperative -- it requires a lot more effort than you would expect.  Once you get the two front moldings removed, everything else basically falls into place.
B00AKYP6KU|5|What else needs to be said, the product is tailor-made for my vehicle.
B000MCXOU4|4|The internal seal allows some fluid and air past, filling the cylinder with oil and making a mess with full extension of the pump shaft.
B008FQQEK6|4|Working so far.  Only complaint is threads are kinda sloppy. Change that tap though.
B00C0T37W2|5|nice plate frame for any 370z car
B000A0CANA|5|Works on the Toyota Corolla.  Easy to install.
B00BXLPD3Y|4|Nice color ans shape, wish the heart was fixed to the ring so that the heart doesn't drop down.
B00HBA4J2M|5|So far it has worked wonderfully.
B00RGQ1KV4|5|Great Suit for the money
B007TYNE8A|5|Light was an exact fit, came quickly.
B00LBOK8JW|3|The ones I received don't have Kawell printed on them and 1 light shines purple instead of 6000K pure White other than that very nice light wish they came in spot light instead of just flood very good value for the money!!
B00VP78V76|5|excellent
B00NT5VDZ4|1|LOVED IT in the beginning, although I began noticing it getting looser on my steering wheel every day. Then BAM! One month later, one stretchy side is COMPLETELTY un-scrunched. Now I have a useless donut.
B00076KL38|5|The spark plug met the specifications.  Good quality!
B005VPWRJ6|5|.Love it, the image is not distorted to make things look farther away than they are.  I am considering getting another for the passenger side so I know where a vehicle really is as apposed to being closer than it appears.  That really helps with so many bike riders on the road now who don't seem to realize they are responsible for their own safety.
B001PWA0IO|5|Performed this method of install:<br /><br />http://www.fordraptorforum.com/f11/ez-down-nutsert-problem-solved-15369/<br /><br />Works as advertised and does not come loose.
B001413GSC|5|LUV IT!!!
B00UBIMGSK|3|thought it would be better than it was... went on/off e-z..nice shine.. covered the swirls on my Black 2013 Avalanche but I noticed it did not keep the shine like other products I've used in the past.. going back to NuFinish .. disapointed to say the least
B004QJH91E|5|Great size, easy to use and NO LEAKS in the rain! Everything stayed nice and dry.  I would recommend the mat to use under and we put the hanging part of the strap in the car - no noise.  Also, make sure you tuck the excess mat under the carrier or it will make noise too.
B007NLSP1A|3|NOT PADDED!  Just a heads up if you're like me and were looking for the padded version (foam around the lens) for motorcycle riding.  These don't have it.  That being said, they're not bad glasses, but nothing special either.  You can buy the same thing at any gas station.
B004ZF39T0|5|I didn't receive the the same stuff shown in the picture i got the slim version in a smaller box.but I'm fine with that and when i compared the ballast that i had to these. The difference was like night and day they are much brighter and display the correct color tone.all i have to do is test them in the long run.
B000C16XL2|2|Only lasted a few months. Already broken, again.
B00I015NM6|5|Was just what I needed to fix my e90 hid headlight.
B00JIEX722|5|What a difference between this and the Factory bulbs, these are super white and bright.
B00265FXTA|5|Love ended up buying two, now both work great.
B00LVHWH8O|1|It doesn't stick! Waste of money. Idiotic mounting system.
B000VKTUE6|5|just what i needed
B001O7PNNM|5|Removes small scratches and swirls. Became a fan of the brand!
B000C94YR4|1|Does not fit at all. Way way off. 2.2 liter Toyota Camry
B00LG0HH72|5|Fits my daughter well
B00RVEAZ9E|5|Perfect for Mazda cars!
B00VBOI7UE|1|Very disappointed !! The glue from the tank pad melted all over the tank and left a huge sticky mess the pad never did adhere to the tank . I don't recommend buying this product !!
B004M7QK1A|4|Great purchase and price. I will order in pairs from now on to coincide with my oil changes and tire rotations.
B004VDSH20|1|this item did not fit my 07 nissan altima dont post stuff that does not fit
B005KFDSRM|5|Very heavy...solid!  Fits my car perfectly.
B00VKNU1PU|5|fits perfectly. easy to instal
B00FASF1OW|1|they were 2 different colors
B00MGV0E8E|5|Great addition to my car . ..2015 kia optima!!
B00SC6ZRP2|5|Comfotable, snaps in easy, finally don't feel &#34;choked&#34; with seatbelt with the Extender.  Price is right.
B000WNVYKK|3|It's way overpriced as far as I'm concerned but does the job and looks nice.
B006WZOVHA|5|excellent
B007TY6UJ0|5|Hail broke the first one so had to order another one.  I think the only down side is if you use for towing with mirror vertical the motor buttons do not operate the same.  However, for the price, willing to overlook that feature.  I do not believe the glass is as strong as OEM.  If the mirror portion breaks you can not replace with OEM you have to buy whole new mirror and arm together.
B003CKBB30|5|Great boots, this is my third set of GS10s, my tried them on and order some too!<br />They feel good from the start, and protect well, they also hold up well to lots of riding
B000LQHRTU|5|Fit perfectly
B000CPI67M|5|It looks good, and the fit up was easy.
B007V2E2AE|4|I like it a lot.  I do wish it were one piece like in the photo.  That is my only real complaint other than mine came damaged.  I'm using it anyhow. The one I bought for my other Honda was a one piece.  It was AMAZING.  I wish they made all of these one pieces.
B001UJB9AU|5|does great
B00P6OOVSW|5|Great rotors for the price, probably the best deal out there. Very well made, I am very impressed.
B00RV83UUG|4|The light bar works very well, it seems to be pretty well built and the light it produces is great, only problem I had with it is the bolts for the mounting bracket were to long and wouldn't tighten the brackets up to the light
B008BLKI2U|2|Speed on the delivery was great!<br />No.1 Major problem, product was rolled up terrible and had creases in the tint.... half of the roll was basically garbage, only was able to tint one head light. Would not recommend.
B007N6QYAO|4|A friend put me on to these tires for my Grand Caravan. One of the best tires I have gotten in years. The ride is immediately noticeable. It feels as the the van is floating down the road while the handling and traction let me know that I have a firm grip on all kinds of road surfaces. I live out in the country and so the road conditions vary quite a bit. I actually have 215-65-15's but I am sure that all sizes will give the same great ride and traction.  I will be sticking with these as long as they keep making them. I am only giving four stars right now because I just got them and have only driven in one rain storm. I am pretty sure that I will not be disappointed when the weather turns worse and the snow starts falling. These all season tires really help you enjoy the ride.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It arrived in advance of the date, and exactly as described! Very simple to put on and fold back into the pouch when not using it. I just followed the YouTube video the seller provided. All the negative comments are horrible and made by people who can't follow directions.
B00877SL2M|1|These LED's are not good quality. 5 of the 10 units in the pack are dud's and defective. 2 bulbs flickered. I attempted to move the wiring around but couldn't get it to work. Then most recently I have a bulb where the LED is now dimmed and not working. In this case you get what you pay for. I should have paid more money for higher quality bulbs. I contacted the seller but they are saying I'm past the warranty period. I should have contacted them earlier about the defective bulbs.
B005JPGTNI|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B005JL38M2|5|Have this magnet on my fridge. Love it!! Thanks. Great idea ..
B009PQHI6Y|5|Product came as described. Manual included. Fast shipment and easy payment :)
B00OA7ZBGW|5|It was the same as the one that came on my RV.
B000C9WLA6|5|Fit was exact for 36Hp Pro-Drive
B005GYDBNS|5|Good  quality!  Good deal! when is on sale
B001AWLNUI|4|it was too big for my crf150r small wheel but it did fit my brothers kx125
B005FLT9ZQ|4|Good product and good value
B004JAPUFM|2|First the good, this front hitch for the 2014 jeep grand cherokee is built like a tank.  It weighs about 50-60 lbs and would bend the frame of your car prior to it breaking.  The welds were flawless.<br /><br />Now the bad:  it doesn't properly fit my 2014 jeep grand cherokee limited 4x4 model.  there is an angle bracket/gusset that connects the front cross frame that interferes with the proper positioning of this hitch and to make it fit it's necessary to lower the hitch by about 1-1/2 inches to get it to clear this gusset.  I contemplated notching the bracket but have concerns that would affect the crashworthiness of the car.  On the other side of the coin the hitch itself will probably help in a crash transfer impact back to the frame so it might be a tossup.  I elected to lower the whole hitch by about 1-1/2 inches by buying longer bolts and placing a piece of electrical unistrut/superstrut between the hitch and the cars longitudinal frame rails.  I'm only ever going to use this hitch for a front mount bike rack so hopefully the unistrut will be a strong-enough spacer.  In retrospect notching the brackets might be better because my hitch is now lower and more likely to hit obstacles in parking lots.  If one were to notch the bracket it would require removing a large amount of the material, over 50%.<br /><br />the second major issues is that the instructions specify windowing the frame to slide in 1/4 inch thick by 1inch wide by 2 inch long washers along with 1/2 inch carriage bolts into the frame.  they indicate that they should be reverse fishwired though the frame and out holes that need to be drilled.  The location for the window into the frame is never specified in the instructions and it is not possible to start at the front end of the frame because it's closed in.  I elected to plasma cut the window under where the hitch is to be mounted with the thought that weakening the frame in that location would be made up for by ultimately bolting the hitch over the windows.  If you loose a bolt inside the frame it would be very difficult to retrieve it and cause annoying rattles indefinitely.<br /><br />so suffice it to say this was a very complicated installation requiring drilling holes and cutting a big window in the frame of a 1 year old car, fabricating spacers, welding, buying new hardware.  Not to mention that every time the hitch is to be test fit it takes two people to vertically press about 60 lbs overhead with one arm while trying to get nuts started with the other hand.  Easy the first few times, exhausting after 10 times.<br /><br />so in summary: strong hitch, interferes with frame bracking, poor instructions, high technical difficulty.
B00VQKCOV6|5|Nice
B00BXPPPVU|2|The key chain looked good for about a week and the bolts/ nuts that hold the leather part in fell out and now I got a key chain with a s10 logo with no leather but besides that the key chain looks really good
B0002SR7TC|4|Havnt used it yet but i just bet it will work.
B00CO6F51M|5|thanks
B00COE3Z8E|5|Finally a wiper that fits the rear window of our 2010 Mazda 5. We tried a couple of others, but they left streaks or parts of the window untouched, even though the blade passed over them. This one makes contact throughout the whole motion of the blade.
B006QGD996|4|They work great for the $$
B0028NEWCO|3|I have a smaller face so these fit pretty well. However I personally don't really care for them. They do work to keep the wind out pretty well but I can see the foam while I'm riding my motorcycle  and it seems to reduce my perception. Almost like tunnel vision to a point. But they do seem to be sturdy and they do function as they should. Will continue to use until I pick up a different pair.
B000FQ2278|5|Great product and fast service.
B00DU1GD98|4|Works well, it took me a while to fiddle with it and make it work but its an easy install.
B013HXLKEQ|5|This is a great deal for the price. You get a microfiber wash mitt, a wax cloth, and a microfiber drying towel. Essentially everything you need to wash your vehicle. This would make a nice gift for a new car owner.<br /><br />The washing mitt fits perfectly on my hand not too big like my previous one. It did a great job washing my car. Doesn't create a ton of suds either so it's easier to rinse off. The drying towel did a great job, didn't leave any streaks or lint behind. I didn't use the wax cloth on the car but I'll definitely be using it this week on the motorcycle or Vespa. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />-wash mitt<br />-wax cloth<br />-drying towel<br />-dries quickly<br />-won't scratch vehicle<br />-machine washable<br />-would recommend
B00G7KPPOI|5|What a great quality product....made my Sportster into a proper  Harley...with looks , but of course that fantastic sound...no longer the ECO Harley that my riding mates called me. Best bit of cash i have spent upgrading  any of my bikes. Good delivery too from States from dealer...thumbs up.HOGs.
B00MGN9F0A|2|Purchased back in April of 2015. Still intermittently works, but the clear silicon that made the switch waterproof is completely fogged out and is sticky. Early on, moisture seemed to always get in.
B00LC1JR50|5|// , They work!<br /><br />Avoid sticking these on motorcycle front tires, though, since it can make the balance weird.
B00SLKD35K|5|works well
B002R2GX1E|5|Excellent
B00EOSSRI6|5|It fits perfect in my cup holder and holds the cigar perfectly.
B00U21WFD2|4|Product serves the purpose very well.  Only regret in paperwork on installation/removal was included and they were short (in length) versus the car's side panel window frames,
B00429NKWK|5|I couldn't be happier.  The headlights look brand new. No degradation after six weeks.
B00KQHVBOQ|5|Got them fast They fit just right<br /><br />Thank You
B00QHJ8ITS|5|Works well, decent quality.  Love that the tips store in the back of the &#34;pen&#34; so it's just the one unit.  Very handy.
B00WT68KB4|1|This is the biggest piece of crap on the market, Out of the box the solenoid was not engaging,torn it down had to put used solenold off old starter just to make it turn , made it to the race cranked engine twice once to put it on the trailer and once to get it off had to replace the starter before we could make the race on top of that it broke the teeth on the flywheel I'm looking for someone who is going to pay for the repairs on this engine LMAO.please don,t make the mistake I did and buy one of these starters spend the extra money and buy a good one to start with you will be money ahead
B0024E6ZW2|5|These are great and help keep my RV steps sturdier for  my husband.
B009GD7PWI|5|good product, worked as described.
B00C0SQ8KG|1|Rip-Off, took my money, no LED Bar in return  (nothing for my hard earn money!
B00GSAUHB8|5|The California sun is great but not for the interior of cars. This shade is awesome. It keeps my car cooler probably by at least 10-20 F. I'm loving it.
B001CEG98U|3|I put these in a 99 E300 Mercedes.  They seem to freshen the cab quite a bit.  The filters I removed were the originals, so, as you can imagine, they were disgusting.  This is certainly an improvement.  If you're cabin air filters are older than 3-4 years, I definitely recommend replacing your cabin air filters.  If you can afford it and have the time, it's probably best to change them more frequently.<br /><br />These filters go in a compartment behind the glove box.  There are some videos online about removing the glove box.  Basically, there are 6 screws to remove.  Two are pretty hard to access in the top middle.  Two are under dust caps on the bottom.  The other two, the easiest, are on the top outside lip.  I had to pull with substantial force to remove the glove box from the dash.  Make sure you disconnect the plug for the glove box light first.<br /><br />The reason this product gets just 3 stars:  It is flimsy.  I struggled to get these filters in properly.  They have a lightweight cardboard frame, the filter material gives, and there is a ring of foam that completely surrounds the edge of the filter.  The compartment is tight.  It was hard to move the first filter over.  It was near impossible to slide the second filter in -- the foam created a lot of friction.  This caused the filters to buckle, collapse, and lift up.  I think the foam is a good idea (what's the point of the filter if the air just slips through the cracks); however, it would be better if these were made with a heavier frame, perhaps plastic, or included reinforcements through the filter area.  I eventually was able to install these well enough.  I had to use a couple of screwdrivers and a stick as a makeshift tool to push one back while holding the other down and in place.  Installing these right can be done, but it's a bit of a pain.  I rate this DIY job a 4/10 on a scale of difficulty -- it's much more difficult than installing an engine air filter.<br /><br />I hope they improve this product before I need to change the filters again.  I priced this out, and Amazon was the best price I could find online at the time.
B000BQKBP2|5|Very well made US product, this Camco sewer cap has 4 hooks vs others that only have two. And when one of those fails, (like what happened to me) you have a very stinky day.  If this were to break one, you would still have 3 to keep the lid on. I broke my original one and this fits tight. It also  has a strap to keep it from falling off during travels.
B008FCCYWC|5|thick rubber, good bed protection, load will not slide
B001KS4CX2|5|OMG  who knew there was even such a thing!  So my AC was not cooling my cabin in my Toyota 4-runner and I noticed the air volume was not as much as it used to be.  After a little research I found that there was a cabin filter.  Well I live a half mile into the woods on a dirt driveway and its dusty in the summer.  When I removed the old filter I was actually shocked that any air could pass through it at all.  New filter installed and the AC blast me into sub zero in no time flat.  I swear the air volume tripled!  I will be changing this every year from now on.
B005JCRRLY|5|I like it no more brake dust and stops great.
B0001XPC7C|3|The Velcro that is included is terrible and will not stick to this coin holder.  To the Manufacturer, If you're going to include a velcro piece to attack this to a surface, make sure the velcro actually sticks to your product.  The coin holder is fine.  It doesn't feel overly cheap, and holds coins without any issues.  Just don't plan on it being where you stuck it.
B002WHABF8|5|Delivered as expected.
B00LMZK1MY|1|I did not serve my car
B007LIB94K|5|Love the blue in this cover matches everything in my car
B00G2TV7OG|5|Bulbs work nicely for the auto bulb swap.
B001TLLZ4E|5|Great unit! Super fast shipping!
B001GMAKZ6|5|Great product and size is perfect for usage
B000TWACQG|5|Oem recommended
B00ABW68OE|5|So glad to find such a quality mat for such a good price. This mat is heavy duty and fits exactly. I know you can cut out for the third seat, but I don't think I will as I see no way to stop spills from leaking out from the cutouts. I will just fold it up for the times I need to put the third row seats in. I didn't really expect this to fit exactly. The color is not an exact match to my carpet, but it is in the vicinity which works fine for me. I use my Tahoe to haul whatever I may need. My husband uses it to haul even messier things than I do, so this will help with keeping the interior nice for much longer. The box arrived on time and in excellent shape.
B007LICL56|5|As pictured.  Fast delivery
B001LHVOVK|1|E46. Link error every time.DLC is in good condition. Friend's scanner does the job,so ... disappointing!
B011X767F0|3|had to make a small modacation but it is working good
B008I16OCQ|5|I was  not awarwe for some reason that it was going to be an actual OEM part.<br />Very satisfied.<br />Quick delivery and fit like a glove.
B0054HNQ32|5|ok
B0048EA6GM|1|wasn't even close to fitting dash.
B00JXLH7CG|4|Worked great on my '88 Ford Bronco II as I was changing bulbs from regular to LEDs. This put the flash rate back within specs.
B000S2SRXC|5|A Good deal for this set of wires, Used on my 99 Suburban 350 Vortec. No problem with the fit, just be sure to match the lengths when you remove the old wires, one at a time works best.
B006DD93EM|5|Great
B0064FXNUE|5|I purchased these for my Dad for Christmas last year, and they have yet to blow out (either one). I have the same brand, but a deeper yellow color. The general lifetime I've noticed on these is around 1 year, give or take. I've had one in there for almost 2, the driver side seems to go within a year. I've been purchasing Nokya brand foglights for years, for around 4 vehicles now, and I love the way they look. They yellow is definitely my favorite, paired with a superwhite headlight bulb.
B008A5Y0PS|5|Bought 2, and both worked with my '01 4 cylinder Grand Am after programming at a GM dealer.  The numbers on the back of the remote exactly match the original remotes, and in my opinion, the button presses are normal, not overly-sensitive as another reviewer thought.
B0002ILK90|5|Excellent fit and function
B00O9H0X2A|5|Works great on my 2015 Corvette Zo6
B003HOWSYC|3|Little challenge in application. Delicate . . . but it looks good.
B002914XHE|4|So far so good. What I needed to clean fence before staining. Obviously not as powerful as a power-washer, but was able to get most of the dirt off. Not 5-stars because you can tell it is made from cheap plastic and will not last that long if not taken cared of well. I have only been using it for a few days, but it is exactly what I needed.
B000C7VZVE|5|A happy customer, all is well. Will return to this seller for sure.
B00DYOVXZ0|5|Works perfectly for the iphone, took a few days to get here but the price cannot be beat.  Was able to reset a few CEL codes.
B00KTHXZLU|5|Works well.
B004NRBGY0|5|Go DUcks!
B008G1X5T8|5|This was a very good everything was perfect on time and just what I wanted thanks
B000NCZDY8|4|Easy to install but the direction s of a lot to be desired. The illustrations where every unclear.
B000CO8ZQU|5|Parts were correct,  assembled properly.  Doesn't come with a new spring washer so don't toss the old one if u don't want the nut retainer to rattle.
B002UC186Q|5|Exact match for what I had.
B000AA4RWM|5|So far looks to be holding up to the elements.
B00DLMHJQW|5|Perfect fit on my 2003 suburban. Couldn't be happier. Easy installation except I had to turn the connectors upside down when attaching to face tory harness. But easy none the less.
B00LA9B4R8|4|It was O.K.
B007R2TQHM|5|works great
B00GUVG6TC|5|Nice quality
B00TEEW5DI|5|Very nice. Fits my car great.
B00H1DOHTY|4|Much smaller amount than expected, but does what it needs.
B0049JQEDK|4|Thus far has protected Road Goblins from making a home within my Dad's Softtail.
B005K23MQC|4|A little pricey for rubber and plastic but fitment and functionality is perfect.
B00D6AHVNK|4|Super fast delivery.  Notch at top for rearview mirror may not quite fit for some vehicles. Looks great, but be careful of how hot the cardboard facing gets in the sun.
B0009JKI7W|4|decent blade at a decent price
B000FFF3GG|5|Works very good.
B000YS9P54|3|The unit works quite well. Downgraded to 3 stars on account of the flimsy plastic attachment which holds one end of the included carry-case broke 30 SECONDS after I started carrying it (empty) out to the car. Unbelievably flimsy and pathetic, really!
B00FA4LN16|5|Good product
B0119XZ28Q|5|This mod takes Seconds to install.  If you can connect two lego peices together you can do this mod.  It's a simple touch that people will notice and wonder what's different?  Thank you DD for making such a great product at a low price.  I have a 2010 with upgraded tail lights and this buy far is the coolest part about the LED tial lights.  What's even better is when you are parked and lock your car the tail's flash insted of the turn signals.  So when you are in a parking garage people notice....Can't be happier with my purchase.  I converted all my signals and back-up bulbs with DD LED's since 2010.  Never had an issue in 5 years.  So...quiality issues was not in my thoughts when purchasing.  They are a great American Co. that stands by their products.
B00CPR5UF6|2|One of the units came with a dead battery. It wasn't worth the hassle of returning to Amazon, so I changed the battery myself.
B0067NTA3M|5|Just bought a brand new WRX came with green stem caps. My son will love these in his stocking
B00Q88QBTC|4|This is a great product. Solid and functional...but...installation is difficult because there are multiple spacers and washers involved, especially if your are also installing a luggage rack.  Would be nice if the manufacturer would include some &#34;keepers&#34; to hold everything together while you fit it on.  Hopefully the Show Chrome folks will read this.  I finally had to use some safety wire on each of the 4 bolts to hold it together, then removed it once the bolts were engaged. Pain in the ass but my passenger loves it!
B00NP60URE|5|Perfect for small jobs, like a motorcycle brake flushes.
B00276J2ZE|1|Product did not fit application even though it is listed as fitting my Silverado. Return policy makes it more cost effective to re-sell the item rather than return it. This is an item that would be better purchased through a Prime seller.
B006WAMIL6|5|Prius 2011. Although I am well into my grandma senior years, I found the instructions and the product highly successful. The first seat cover was a bit tricky, but once I had experience with the first seat, the second was a breeze.  The covers fit just right and I love the blue and black design in my white car. Thanks..<br />111-2597038-2761012.
B000B8WMAW|1|I tried to return this chair but had thrown away the box it came in, I didn't feel like getting bothered in finding another box ended up keeping it...<br />The chair is uncomfortable, the fabric does not stetch at all - the worst part was that it began to creek and squeek within just a few minutes of using it and the creaks and squeeks were comically loud within a week..and it's been indoors the whole time!<br /><br />The two little rubber stoppers at the bottom came right off within seconds of normal use (our feet just naturally hit them and pushed them off)<br /><br />I cannot BELIEVE I paid $53 bucks for this. I was fooled by the positive reviews on amazon (rarely happens).  I am more comfortable in the $10 camping seats you find at amazon.<br /><br />**Fun Note: I played Xbox while sitting on this, and gamers told me to mute my mic, they could hear the squeaking of the chair.
B001HC1BMG|2|This looks nice but it's not practical. I have to babysit my cigarette while trying to concentrate on the road.....that's no good! There's no secure or trustworthy spot to lay or put your cigarette on with this ashtray...so you're left with two choices.... holding your cig till you've smoked the whole thing, or putting the cig into the one hole (that is Not a snuffer) that's open all the way through to the collection tray/bottom, which allows the cig to stay lit and you also can't close the lid with a cig in that hole. If you want to put your cigarette out early before smoking the whole thing....forget it! these no place to tamp it out!  Two stars just because of it's capacity and looks.
B004OU5F2A|5|Best lighting company I have found. I have tried a lot but not gonna name names.. Best quality best customer service flat out best product. I love opt7 really looking forward to trying out your other products.
B00Z7KIZPA|1|one of the clips was missing when the package was received.
B00FJUEO12|5|Having been injured in an accident and using a wheelchair; I decided to order this cart to use to help me carry things around the house. Perfect size and rolls real easily. So happy with this purchase. Has made things so much easier for me.
B005IWPCAI|5|Works great.
B00OK8D1QS|1|The tape seemed old, and came off within a week.
B00ZOKJVAG|4|One of them (the static material ) tore right away, not sure if it was already like that,  however the seller was prompt to replace the item and regardless of how long they may last, they  significantly reduce glare on my already tinted window
B008I7O65C|5|Only wish it came in gloss black.
B00IFPJGE8|5|it is an awesome product as described...on my first application and showed very promising result!<br />shipped and delivered prompytly
B005N53C9I|1|Cute bohemian look but didn't work in my daughter's 2002 Lexus SUV.  Slid off.  Donated.
B009DK3RO4|5|Nice
B000BYD3RC|5|That right part. Cheaper than Dealer
B0007WP5G0|4|Great cover. Performs its functions well. Easy on and off.
B0007LZH00|4|It works well and seems to be built well but not what I would call a 5 star product.
B00RHSDZ28|5|fits perfectly!
B00C96TYVE|5|For those wondering this DOES fit all 2015 Civic models, even though the Amazon description says it does not. The will fit ALL 9th gen civic models excluding the SI. The exhaust itself is very well made and highly polished. It looks beautiful. The sound is also amazing. It has a very low, deep pitch. No high pitched &#34;rice&#34; sounds at all. Drone in the car is loud at lower RPMs but goes away at normal driving speed. Throttle response also feels to have improved. I have this exhaust paired with a K&N short ram intake (which Amazon also said did not fit the 2015, but did). If you are looking for a nice exhaust for your 9th gen non SI Civic, this is the one.
B011T51288|5|Excellent
B008P525KK|5|Works perfectly. Thank you.
B004AFISA0|5|Worked great on my LS2.
B000CHGK3C|5|perfect fit for the 94 accord 4cyl.
B00ONH7Z2C|5|fit and function perfectly
B005LSUEQG|5|Bonded well to hood after wiping with PRE paint prep cleaner, but any mineral based paint thinner will do the same.  Thick and robust with sound deadening quality and the heat shield seems to be holding up well after a few weeks of underhood use.
B006GFPF30|5|This product has kept my boats battery fully charged meaning the bilge pump will always run. I bought this together with the CBC regulator which protects the battery from over charging.
B002IVATWI|5|Thanks, great  Alex
B0024E6QX0|3|Great in the beginning but the foil must be plasticized as it started to crack and shred after being in the sun. If I had to buy again I would buy without the metallic layer and just do the basic on as I think it works sufficiently and would not have the deterioration that this one does. That being said we also may buy more of these and not put the shiny layer up directly into the sun but down so it still would have some reflective value but not deteriorate.
B00IDZR4QW|5|Hyundai left ours off...it's nice to have the badge on the car.
B00GJKNN40|3|I bought and had to cancel the order because it is 'common neg only'. I need to monitor current on the positive side going into the fuse block. I wouldn't care if the polarity reads negative. totally bummed because this unit would have been perfect. DROK you make a positive common?
B000BGHYH0|5|fairly easy to install, works fine, Thanks
B00G6KGPFM|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B000RFSARI|4|Just what i needed worked just fine
B0051V4FKY|5|Improvement over the standard thermo quiets
B00BWY8HJ4|1|The starter failed after a few uses!!<br />I put in this &#34;new&#34; starter at the beginning of Summer and it worked fine for two weekends, but failed after sitting for two weeks! Terrible quality!!<br />Needless to say this ruined almost half of the Summer because of a non-starting Sea Doo.
B00C0XANNE|5|This product was listed not compatible with my truck without modifications. They listed it correctly. I had to cut off a tab on the inside of my truck, that was doing nothing. Also, I had to bend my bumper,on top and bottom, some to fit the roller fairlead. You're better off getting the hawes if you plan on selling the truck..<br /><br />Other than that, it was easy to screw it in. It's very sturdy. I put in a zeon 12 with it. That was another struggle but I made it fit.
B00JEGXVL6|3|Great looking product, lost all reception of local radio stations.
B0055QOKC8|5|My brother put it on his bike and it fits great!
B00ESQKKXO|5|Great product, excellent service
B0012WW3X2|5|Tough to install but it works the way it should
B0083POY10|4|Again nice value, look good! However, the locking screws were so small that I just thru them away. I'd get them again and just be careful where you park.
B00BTSRUXW|3|It works when it wants to.  Sometimes, I have to click more than usual, but it works.
B004XG3QKI|5|Easy install and good fit. Helps a bit with mileage. I could feel the way the drag was reduced.
B003E3K1TU|5|I have had these covers on my 2008 ford edge for 2 years now.  still looks great holding up well  no problems going thru the car washes.  i would and have recommend the covers to my friends.  great product.
B00DD0Z4BE|5|Love it
B002P33KVQ|5|Very pleased!  Replaced pump on 36' boat and great pressure and super quiet!
B0010E00T6|5|Package came on time and as described ,  quick install.... Would buy again
B00C9T4WXG|3|Had a problem with this item, before installation luckily, but Amazon's Great Customer will keep me coming back!
B00J8WK18M|5|Blends in perfectly with the car, installed seamlessly and a cheap fix to the floppy visor Subies seem to have from the 2010 time period.
B0026M9DZS|5|Easy install. Can't beat the price.
B00VGL5SVI|5|VERY HEAVY DUTY.  FAST SHIPPING
B00JMCCE6U|5|Great oil from Pennzoil.  It is the recommended oil for SRT engines!
B004V6RKBG|1|The brake pad SUCK.  Nothing but noise from them.  Don't wast you time or money.
B001KPELKY|5|Worked well, good price.
B009PDAU0S|5|works very good thank you
B00LEBLI82|5|Bright,easy to install. lets see if they hold up.Buy em
B000CPAEYK|5|Biggest problem was starting the bolts. The holes were cut with such tight tolerances it was difficult to align them perfectly (with only one person) so the bolts would fit. That took most of my install time. Overall it was a one man (and a floor jack) install that took 1.5 hours.
B00192KYE0|3|Lid too flimsy and cannot secure bag inside when lid closed.
B000FOUB8M|5|this thing is perfect for what it is intended for.  it is much stronger than comparable product and at a great price as well.  regarding the issues some others have mentioned (difficulty unlocking the bar and difficulty in lining it up correctly), i did not find either to be a problem.<br /><br />to line up the bar consistently, i installed it once and then put duct tape on the bar at that location.  each time i use it now, i just line it up with the duct tape.<br /><br />to avoid pinched fingers when releasing the bar, do not just push the release button.  instead, apply pressure to the engaging lever first.  this will remove the pressure from the release button and you can then easily click the release button and remove the bar.
B005DNFVBW|3|The springs are good and do the job real nice. BUT whoever packages it has to be more careful because the description reads that its got durable rust resisting pain and when I received it  the paint had chipped off bc the springs are rolling around hitting each other.
B00T5U9NUO|1|Poor quality an very dull in color
B00EDGQY84|4|water went into only one of the squares
B000BLNTQU|3|Wrong size. These are not for brake lights.
B008EFHUYW|1|Bought Bell Performance Ethanol Defense at a &#34;Mom & Pop&#34; marine dealer on an impulse purchase because the salesman had helped me out a bunch of times with advice. I used it on my outboards. Stopped using it, since I can't get MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) on it. I would not put any product into my engines without knowing what is it. Where's the MSDS?
B00266H24I|5|does it's job and fits perfectly. highly recommended
B001JT1CEE|5|I needed wire for an automotive project. This wire worked quite well.  I got it just because it was red and black (hot and ground).  It soldered well to auxiliary LED lights.  No complaints at all about it.
B0081KM6Q2|5|Did work great for my son science project.<br />Arrive fast.
B001DZONCW|5|I have used several types of and different brands of charge controllers for my solar systems. Although I have switched to a MPPT controller for my main system, I still use this model Sunforce for two other stationary and one portable system. I like the built in meter display, and I especially like the heavy gauge wires for the battery and panel connections that are built into the unit. Saves having to strip wire ends and poking them into screw holes. And this controller does actually switch into float mode when battery is full. This is the controller I recommend to my friends just starting out in solar. A solid performing unit and a good price.
B007U9EXVQ|5|looks great on the driver side door of my pickup truck. Now I need an AR-15, a gun rack, a machete, and a .45...
B000RMNU4E|5|i had some pretty bad rust i was covering up on my truck and most primers i have used in the past, the rust comes threw after a few days. i used 3 coats of this after sanding and bondo. its been a month now and no rust has come threw. so far i am very impressed
B008EXHNZA|4|First one was broke second one works fine
B005ETKB7Y|5|Bought this for my saturn S-series (96 SL) about 4 months ago. has been holding up great no issues! WAY cheaper then anywhere else
B0009V1WR0|1|Quite working after the 3rd use on a 6,000 mile ride. It will not open up and the good thing was that it didn't happen when it was on the brake rotor.
B001YJ7NI8|4|This looks like a great stand.  I am returning it due to concern for using it when removing the front axle.  This stand supports the front fork using somewhat conical plugs that go into the bottom of the forks, where the forks screw together.  I am not sure how that will affect tightening a fork on a front axle as the plugs could end up holding the fork bottoms apart.  Maybe they don't, but I'd rather not take a chance.
B00SJTY488|4|Great quality and looks.<br />Installed easily.
B000NJ97EI|4|Hanging in motorhome shower. Working as advertised.
B003W4GNCA|5|Wouldn't ride without my net. The color is perfect for that girly flair (Wish they made pink too). Holds just about anything I need it to.
B0028QVNGO|4|Used to keep dust out of eyes. Worked though fogged up while in use but better than dust.
B000GTX44E|5|Direct press-in replacement for my yzf600r. Correct diameters and good solid feel to the bearings.<br />Have used these for the past 40,000 mi through rain and salted roads (and of course some nice days too!). Replacing just for preventive maintenance, as the ones I just removed still rotate smoothly, though the seals have worn out. OEM Yamaha parts only made it to 20k...that days something about how good these are.<br />Would/will definitely buy again.
B00393NDHW|4|Delivery was quick and packaging was great! These Headlights are an easy install, and cheap performance look. Color ranges from greenish to very light blue on road and surroundings. Looking head on to the headlights is a white look. Keep in mind these are 10k EMULATORS. Meaning they mimic the look of hid. Also try installing with latex gloves to prevent risk of touching bulb. All in all I am satisfied with this purchase!
B00B3ZCAOK|1|ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY WORST QUALITY OF A CAT BACK EXHAUST SYSTEM MADE! Ever since I bought this  exhaust i have had nothing but problems. First off there were fitment issues with the hangars not lining up straight or right. (In which that did not make me upset i was being optimistic about) then i had clearence issues where it would rub up against my tire well. (Again still being optimistic about the whole thing.) After a exactly 6 weeks go by i hear a &#34;clanging&#34; noise coming from, specifically, the Violator muffler. So now i am getting aggetated. I call up customer service and talk to the &#34;tech&#34; which he claims he knows what the problem is. So he give me a couple &#34;tips&#34; on how to fix the problem, because he claims its not the mufflers. I do what he says that night and the next morning again with the &#34;clanging&#34; noises. After i call the tech back i tell him what the &#34;problem actually is&#34;, because i am the one that is present tring to fix MY OWN CAR. Still.... he says it cant be the mufflers.<br /><br />He goes on to tell me the only thing i can do is purchase another one and send mine back. What is that going to do??? He then states, &#34;if i send mine in they can inspect it to see if it is defective.... if so they will give me a replacement. I just have to PAY MY OWN SHIPPING FOR A DEFECTED PRODUCT&#34;<br />In which i still do not understand how they can tell if it is defected if they do not have it hooked up to MY particular exhaust.<br /><br />Overall they were no help and kept saying i was wrong. Did not help the customer one bit and was going to have me PAY for any little thing. Look on the forums im not the only one with this issue. I shouldve done research but now im trying to help other not to put this LOW QUALITY PIECE OF SCRAP METAL on their vehicle.<br /><br />I still till this day have it on my car because i have no money to get it fixed. I save for an exhaust for over a year. Come to find out i wasted $600 on crap.
B00308NULA|2|bought this it fits nice but only 1 year old and the snap on the back window roll up broke off alot of money for 1 year then problems
B00W6IZF2C|1|The adhesive was not installed properly at the factory.  The company refunded my account.  Not the best out there.
B00BCRMA9Y|5|Love the seat covers
B000C5SGCM|5|Perfect Fit for my 2003 Mitsubishi Spacewagon.
B001GJ3FIS|3|This nozzle is okay for the price. The spray for jet is kind of a joke as it is fans out. Probably wouldn't buy it again
B00YGJE7FK|5|I received a discount for this product but here is my Super Honest Review!  Good stuff And Useful.  Perfect Compatible on 2012 Nissan Rogue.
B00PXAS0KO|3|They fit and work but there is a pretty big gap on the tire were it connects together for our tire size.
B00AKLZ8VA|1|This frame is junk. A couple months of winter and it is rusted like you wouldn't believe. I contacted the vendor and they said it wasn't rust,which is BS, and they weren't willing to compensate me at all. My fancy chemistry degree helps me know it's rust, I just hate being lied to. It would have felt better if they said: you bought a 20 dollar frame and got a 20 frame. At least that's truthful. Try the bookstore for a higher quality engraved one.
B00LACOGCK|5|Good communication, great product.  My only gripe is I wish the brackets the go under the door had some sort of rubber protection.
B005H12SZ2|4|Good mirror for the price ... a little shaky at high speeds but they do the job... fit with absolutely no problem
B000JZD7JC|5|Works great, bolted right into place no issues with it!
B01092IFZK|5|LOVE MY NEW SEAT COVERS WERE EASY TO INSTALL.
B00829L1ZE|4|Bought this as a replacement for my 07 A4, unfortunately it does not fit. I've read here that it fits an 04 A4 so it the design seems to have changed for the B7 (2005.5'-2008). Just a heads up for anyone else with a B7. In the photos I have attached, the OEM is on the right and this item is on the left, you can see the differences for yourself.<br /><br />As for the item, its of course not as nice as the OEM cover, but for the price its definitely worth it.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars, its a good value if you know it will fit. It was a gamble for me so I'm not too disappointed about it.
B00TUKY03O|1|Please do not buy this! From one human being to another. Anyone who rates this more than a one star either works for the company or does not want to say how bad this product is and save your health and the money. I should have listened to the other reviews. Please believe me DO NOT BUY THIS!! It smell is Cancer causing Toxic! I washed the thing multiple times in a washing machine and the smell is still just as strong. Horrible horrible horrible. Please save your money. The smell was so bad I didn't even want to keep it long enough to return it so I threw it away. WITH MUCH AGAPE I SAY TO YOU AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS. And to the owners of the company that sells and makes this SHAME ON YOU. You are killing your fellow human beings to make money. DISGUSTING.
B00FRHODI6|5|Too good
B00BUS3AKS|5|Less expensive then others,user friendly  fitted well in my son 2015 forester since it was not included when I picked up the car for his birthday /graduation's<br />gift?
B00DKMZ834|5|Exactly as advertised.
B00RDS0NO0|1|This is obviously a cheap copy of a quality battery indicator. I purchased 3 copies and the first one i tried failed.
B003V57NUQ|4|...but don't trust the straps. Buy some good ratchet straps.
B0060YRD9G|1|Will not fit on my car. Put in make and model and its so far off I can't believe it. And now I can't return them. DO NOT order parts on this site.
B001QVA6TW|5|So far great product... Fast delivery
B008C103HO|3|As other have said it is a little bulky and a chore to roll-up every time. It does cover the entire windshield.
B0068EUS2W|5|Product worked as advertised and shipped promptly
B00JA3BMDW|5|Glad I had this when the A/C repairman tried to say everything was fixed and working and was ready to bolt. I told him I wanted to test the temp of the air coming out of the vents before he left. The air was about the same temp as what the thermostat was set to. The same A/C repairman told me 30 minutes prior that the temp should be about 20 degrees lower at the vents than what the thermostat is set to. So with my thermostat set to 82, the air should have been about 62, but was coming out at 79. He rechecked everything and found I was completely out of freon and had a leak in my system. Glad I had this so I didn't go yet another day without working A/C when the outdoor temps were over 110!
B002Q1KTD4|5|Quick shipping and installed easily! Gave my boyfriends motorcycle the updated look he was looking for.
B00KL3ALGO|5|These are great!  I actually just ordered a second set.  Easier to apply and stays in place WAY better that the suction cups.  Highly recommended.
B00L3ZCEM8|5|Awesome lights
B00IQNMVWS|1|The earrings did not have the middle gold part on it and the earring set looks like it was made by a child. I don't like to put this review down but I am very disappointed with it.
B003YCEMUA|5|Thank you!
B00GRSOJSS|5|Says to soak item for 1-12 hours depending on how deep the rust is. Well I couldn't soak a 5th wheel hitch so I used a rag continually wetting it while using a wire brush. Little elbow grease but it is a great product! Also used bare handed, no irritation on my sensitive skin.
B00SGFZCTA|5|Exactly as described.  Looks tailored and and easy to get keys off and on.
B00GSAUHB8|3|Nothing special for the amount of money. Does the job though.
B00GFF0Q2Q|5|Too heavy for my scooter, but that's ok because I planned on drilling out the weights to dial them in. Fit my Genuine Scooter Company Roughhouse 50/PGO PMX 50 Naked stock variator perfectly.
B00EPQUH3A|1|These do not fit up to ANY 128&#34;. I have a Yamaha '07 and '08 and both are listed as 128&#34; or less. It didn't fit either.
B001O05S0C|5|Product is A+ but this will not fit my '96 Accord EX with a 2.2L VTEC. Even though Amazon says it will.<br /><br />Everything looks right except that the coil mount and installation is different. There are nuts on the actual coil and this prevents it from being able to be mounted in the stock distributor (because the distributor is threaded and the bolts are supposed to go through the coil, not thread into it) and the coil hookups are for ring terminals rather than spade terminals (spade is what is stock on 5th gen). I stopped trying to install once I saw that the coil would not work (which is where I started) so I do not know if any of the other parts will fit. I know that the rotor cap is different, where it makes contact with the coil but if the coil could have been installed that would not have been an issue.<br /><br />Very disappointed that this does not fit! I am so tired of getting parts and having to return them because the listing says it will fit and when I get it, for one reason or another, it doesn't fit.<br /><br />Come on guys, you can do better than this! If this keeps happening people are going to stop buying from you guys. I know I am getting pretty tired of this crap. ugh!!
B00BC8331C|4|Arrived as described, just wish it were a little firmer.
B000W0KTKY|5|Awesome lock for my bike.. Small and easy to use
B00OTJZ1C0|5|Fast shipping, fit and finish are outstanding. Installation is straight forward. No drilling required. These OEM style flares should be standard items on any pick up. Highly recommended.
B00OZXBFZC|1|Do not buy! Very cheap and flimsy and only has 3mm tape! Do not waste your money.
B00H1TSOO2|4|Great lights. The plug is trash, but other than that great set up.
B00MBP6UJC|3|When I first received this product I loved it because I love Betty Boop. The design is nice but the product is not sturdy. I've had it for about 3 weeks now and it's no good. I wouldn't buy again.
B008SH4DR8|5|Great replacement for the stock tank!!
B00AKF1NWY|5|Perfect size and fit
B000AA8G5G|5|Works like it should!
B00471T798|3|Locks could be improved.
B00PV5G9NG|5|The fit is wonderful and I know it will be easier to keep clean versus the carpet mats.
B00G620ZVU|5|very bright pods for the price
B0012WHBSO|5|Great
B000BG1X54|5|very cool tool to use. works great
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Paid for itself many times, and it's small, love it!!
B00AB3HC98|3|Works, and is used daily. Only gripe is that SOA3991310 was received, not SOA3991300 as listed. The difference is the 310 is for the newer models with eyesight. Still fits, but not as well as it would have if it was the older version as listed.
B008CLNYPC|5|Built to last the abuse of 4 wheeling
B000GPRG7E|5|This is a very nice steering wheel cover for our MG.  other reviews we saw and watched said it would take 3 hours to put on.  Since my husband is an upholsterer he had all the tools and skills needed to complete the job in only an hour.  It looks great and feels good too.
B002807VWU|5|Very well build. Fit perfectly on my 2001 Toyota Sequoia.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Worked ok
B003SS62PS|5|great
B00545NHWY|5|Great chains.  Could not find anything comparable for the price.
B0002JMLQU|5|Topped shudder imediately. Also improved gas mileage.
B002RNFP3A|1|Not happy with this product. It's nothing more then wax.  Didn't hide the scratches at all.  Waste of money....
B00F2N1JWS|3|When i received it , it had a crease in it. But it still looked sweet on my Raptor F150.
B0084O11YI|5|nice sticker smaller than it looks
B0009V1WSE|5|Thanks, just what I ordered.  Secure motorcycle to the front of the camper.
B00OLVGGZM|5|A perfect fit for my 2015 F150 Crew Cab.  The quality is great and was very easy to install - really nice.
B003FID1NW|5|Good Product , but not able to get this programmed by myself for my Car [2000 Model Pontiac Grand Prix SE]. Dealers are ready to program the only the key that we buy with them again felt like locksmiths also charging like higher and with bit confusion finally returned it back.
B00OSZ2N08|4|A bit more expensive than other car trash bags, but the durability and make are far superior. Nothing too fancy -- just does the job as a trash can.
B000EDOT8C|5|This is perfect to cover our motorhome's stovetop!  It make a tiny kitchen more usable.  The cutting board does not move at all while driving - the grippers on the bottom do their job!
B00N2BRC9G|1|too small. Sizing is not accurate
B007RXBTI0|5|Exactly what I Needed. Good Buy.
B007ZLNC7A|5|1/4 the cost of the dealer.  Amazing how Cadillac rips off its customers. Works fine so far!
B000221M94|5|Great product to prevent doors from slamming into the walls...
B00HSIWTYW|5|I was astounded by how well these lockouts are made. They seem exponentially stronger than Warn ones that have flimsy aluminum internals. This kit comes with 3 different shim packs that allow you to use them on a variety of axles and stubs. The step by step instructions included are well written and have tons of color pictures. These lockouts engage solid and feel hefty, they cost more but they'll be the last ones you'll ever need!<br /> I used them on dodge D44 5x5.5 hubs with ECGS 19 spline stubs that are 9.94&#34; long.
B00D6IC14G|5|great air filter!! Excellent cost x benefits, very easy to install.... 3 sizes adapters and loop included.. Beware of some fine tips that can stick your finger...
B000C9W2AK|5|Great value for the price. Fits as you'd expect and has some heft to it. Probably the same as Fram just painted blue.
B00V4049K2|5|My truck sat in a field for a year and a half, and even after paying for a professional detail, it always had a sort of musty smell when I first got into it. I bought an air freshener that is supposed to be very good, but the scent just made my truck stink even more, and it didn't absorb/neutralize the original odor like I thought it was supposed to do.<br /><br />The PURGGO (not sure how that is pronounced) air freshener seemed kind of spendy, but it has excellent reviews and the claim is that it will last for over a year, so I decided to take a chance with it and I'm glad I did. Whatever the smell in my truck was is finally gone. It used to be the first thing I'd think about when I got in, and now it's something that never crosses my mind. This air freshener also matches my tan interior pretty well. Not that I bought it for the looks.<br /><br />So, if your vehicle has a persistent odor and you'd like to eliminate it, you should give this thing a try. It's more expensive than some other car fresheners, but it actually works. Well worth the price tag for me. If, after a year+ my truck begins to smell funny again, I won't hesitate to buy another one of these.
B00MOBPGR0|5|It's a very nice detailed sticker!!!
B00O7UG1JS|5|Wife loves it
B001PLL7R8|5|Did the job .
B00KQ4NTT4|5|Very nice helmet at a great price, I really like it. Thankfully no experience with a crash and how well it holds up. I can only it looks nice and I get compliments on it. Its fairly light and fits comfortably.
B00T8HPF24|5|Replaced headlights in my car. Took all of 5 minutes. Super bright and comes with filters to change the colors of them. They do make a funny noise but you only hear it with the hood up or lights on with car off.
B001TXWNLQ|1|It only provides 0.5 Amps not enough to power my device
B001DCF0Y0|4|I have always used STANT Locking fuel Cap for my vehicles. I would have given it a 5 stars if the lock and key mechanism was improved and easy to open for my current vehicle. Most dealership discourages the use of this gas cap. It works. It's a good securement for your car and an added peace of mind. Thanks STANT !
B00JIEX722|1|When on for a bit starts to flicker
B006IPTOWQ|4|They are brighter, & I will likely get them again.  Noticed a difference on the first road trip.
B00KTIGSTK|1|I had to return the items twice because they would not work for my car.
B00ONH6ADW|5|Just as promised!
B00JGIEV0M|3|Received the converter, however it does not work. Any tips on how to install? Appears to be a well made product. I had high hopes that this would solve my bulb problem.
B00B1VV2NG|5|Was so glad to find this flower on Amazon.  It fits well in  an AutoVase clip vase that I bought on Amazon also.  It fits into my AC vent and the flower goes well with my Black Beetle.
B00NQ11S9W|3|Vety expensive for what it is...
B000778LC0|1|It says it is &#34;White&#34; but the color is actually as beige as beige can get
B007X4S3XM|5|These are great little maintainers. I ise them for my lawnmower, my boat battery, and for a car I don't drive often enough.
B000C984SE|4|This was slightly larger than the original, but it still worked great- This went on an '03 Odyssey.
B00HZ403FG|5|Great product...so far.
B003EM3W88|4|This is a flat piece of material that you stretch out over your existing seat.  Had to work it on and staple that back down.  End product looks good.
B002POHTUS|4|Appears to be a true 16 gauge copper wire.  Slightly stiff but otherwise a good product.
B000GZPH2U|4|Help tremendously on those multi-hour trips.  You just have to train your hand to relax a bit, since most of us are use to holding the throttle a little too tight.
B00029WSWC|2|Could not attach to Toyota mirror
B00HJ158ZA|5|Its so cute well made I use it for home and not for car!!
B004LDHXB6|5|1/4 the cost of the dealer!  Works just fine so far.  Amazing how much Cadillac rips you off.
B00NIS0YO8|5|Great mats! they fit great and work awesome!<br />Would buy again
B0024ECCJW|5|Great product. Easy installation. Will pay for itself in no time.
B007QV1VCC|5|GREAT PRICE, GOOD DELIVERY TIME
B001AWU6KQ|5|First pair of these I ordered had one of the straps that came apart....so, I called Amazon...and they sent me another pair which ended up being ok. I just sent the other pair back. All is good and they look great in my Jeep.
B00D6N0ZIA|5|Works great very pleased
B00QUL6U8Y|1|Didn't work.
B000KL3AJW|3|they are too rigid and the clip that holds them in place tore the carpet
B00PUOQRK8|5|So far, I really like this seat cover. It is perfect for the driver's seat and doesn't cover the side air bags.
B00K5D30IG|5|Yes we were very please with the emblem.  Our car looks great and we are very happy with our purchase.
B001O7PNNM|5|Works great ! I have buffed my car a little with Meguiar's X3070 applicator pad . It took out lot of swirl marks instantly. I have not used a machine just hand buffing so i was tired after sometime but even though with my lazy circular movements it did work.  As a car enthusiast, I would highly recommend this product for removing light to heavy swirl marks and paint oxidation , I dont think it can take out deep scratches.  Much more shine and clarity can be obtained for sure if you can buff your car using this product with machine .
B000C8P8M0|3|fit fine...no problems
B003YMVOUG|5|Installed day of arrival.  Perfect.  No problems
B00DUL8BJS|5|This item is perfect for keeping the dust off of my car as it sits during the week and perfect fit too. Thank you for quickly getting this car cover to me.
B001C9VEOY|1|I bought these for my Mazda 3, and one of the bolts broke during installation.  I was using a torque wrench, and torquing to spec.
B00JJBWMDO|5|Good product. Very effective
B0033QNZZ0|5|Time to change due to age.
B001DCH3TA|5|My husband installed them, requires two people. One to hold hatch back up while other removes. Instructions printed on carton itself no separate paper. Went well, still stiff. Am pleased with product.
B00FJH9AC8|5|I thought in the beginning it might not be enough but it really surprised me.
B000CIPHUI|5|GOOD PRODUCTS
B00HWI47DO|3|Easy install
B0000AXPDU|5|thanks
B000EDLANY|4|Would give it 5 stars, but shipping took 7 days... And this is a prime product.
B00G0P0ER8|5|I was so worried after the original dry-rotted in the Texas heat, but this item came on time and fit perfectly and now I have better reception than before!<br />You really &#34;gotta hold your mouth right&#34; as they say and squeeze and wriggle this thing to get it in, but it's secure and looks great!
B001C9KNT6|5|Great. Performed as expected.
B000FQ7QYC|1|it doesn't fit looks nothing like original
B00029WVII|5|Just what my car needed
B00TPU8R2Y|5|The right product at the right price!
B001CF3NWE|3|I've had it for 2 weeks now, putting it on and off the Jeep JKU.  It already has a hole in it near where it fits on the windshield.  Very disappointing for the price.  It's not lined either, so really it's nothing more than a thicker paper product.  I don't think it's going to last six months.  Need to find a better product.
B005H7DRQA|5|It's great for my leather backpack, good stuff.
B001SG8Z1Q|5|great
B002MB594M|4|Its very big about two inches across. If you have small mirrors it will cover whole of it.
B001LHVOVK|5|excellent tool for testing ....
B000GU0YFK|5|These were a great fit on the bike.  Came very quick with no issues!
B00HHG910A|5|For someone who routinely loses keys in the house, these looked as if they'd be a perfect solution to the problem.  Have had them for a full month and have had occasion to use them three times.  I haven't found the beep to be as loud as some people have indicated in their reviews, but certainly loud enough if I'm within 15 feet of the misplaced key.  This has prevented me from being late for meetings since I'm not running around frantically looking for either my car key or house key.  This little system was easy to set up, worked immediately, and does exactly what I need.  I was happy with the company that sells this product as it came exactly as described, well-packaged and right on time.  I would recommend this product if you're inclined to misplace your keys, it's been a big help.
B011ZVU1X8|5|Sturdy and convenient. I especially like that it closes at the top so that it looks neat! I am actually going to use this for storage in the cargo area of my van by hanging it off of the headrest in the third row and plan in putting extra clothing, sunscreen, and diapers in it so that my cargo area looks neater and the items are still easily accessible.
B008AFT8U0|5|Exactly as advertised.
B000V527AU|5|Good fit on my 2002 odyssey.
B000VKTUJQ|5|I replace my Tacoma filters myself and I always keep one on hand so I reorder these every few months.  They are not very expensive and really are worth taking the time to replace when you service your vehicle -especially when you live in a dusty environment or go off road in the desert like I do.
B00IO93NQC|3|They are ok, for the price.  They are smooth, but not quiet.  They were quiet for about a week, and now they squeak pretty loud at low speeds (when slowing at a stoplight).
B006UH66R8|4|does the job, got the lugs off
B001O21692|1|Doesnt even fit the car it said it fits
B00FXIFBLC|5|Just as described.
B00MG687JW|5|Product works excellent. It is a prefect product for vehicles. It gets charged up in 2-3 hours. It can give more than 10 Jump Start. I found this product to be very well made. It is quite easy to use.
B005GT6EZ0|1|Not to happy. After reading a few blogs, don't work well with dual control station. No help at all
B00IOBSZXQ|5|This cleaner works very well. Not sure why it has mediocre ratings. It got rid of blue color that my jeans left on tan leather seats. It didn't damage the leather either. Handy for future cleaning.
B00IX5MOD0|5|First off, I having no skills whatsoever. Secondly, I have hands like hams. Having said that, this install took me less than five minutes start to finish on my new Mini Cooper S. The new part is much more substantial than the one it replaced. I am thoroughly pleased.
B00OBWQQ7O|5|nice
B00RPGWE9C|5|Perfect fit!  Great protection for your carpet.  Fits my 2015 SuperCrew perfectly.
B000E4OHZQ|5|Item was delivered as described. No problems. Fit car just fine.
B00DHVKLVW|5|Purchased for a friend. Good quality, good price, arrived quick.
B0014GDGPU|5|Great products! Fast shipping!
B003TQ5PWA|3|Very disappointed. Only 3 gaskets fit the 440.
B006H34BUY|5|I wasn't expecting much from this but I have been very pleased. I bought this for just dusting my car but it's also amazing if you smoke e-cigs in your car and get that annoying fog on your windows that comes along with it. It's super soft and works really well on the windows. Just a few strokes and your window is fog free! Great for when you're in a rush!
B008BB4LOQ|5|This fit my 98 FXD with no problem. Stronger than stock and way cheaper than anything at the dealer! Very easy installation. No need to remove mufflers like the shop manual says, I was able to fit it in without much fussing. Putting the primary cover back on took more time than installing the starter. I've had this on for half a season and no problems.
B001C9XU9Q|5|It worked exelent.
B00RM26KZI|1|Not good
B00NWT0290|5|This product worked great fit perfect I would recommend it
B00ELJLU3W|2|Very SMALL...I used for backseats..bought another one to match...Very Dissappointed....was just a dot in the trunk...!!!!
B0145R9IFG|5|these things are perfect. They slid into place easily on my 2009 toyota Rav 4. A little big for the seats but the foam squishes into place and with a little work you can't tell. solves the problem, anything that falls bounces instead of falling into the blackhole under the seat.
B008I2OZK8|5|Good quality stuff. In my opinion a  much better alternative than using regular polish -when your car is medium to dark blue in color.<br />It did wonders for my  sunburned bleachlike-streaked roof-top. It was this or a new paint job ..and this was cheaper.
B00062YIRS|3|Is not an exact fit on a 2010 Mercedes-Benz E350 Sport. Had to manually trim the outer rubber &#34;lip&#34; so that it would fit.
B0060C7YG0|4|Excellent product! Matched my 07' trucks color almost perfectly. It is just a shade lighter but only noticeable by me, and that's why 4 stars..
B0093NAAY6|5|easy set up and works great!
B005D27K7Q|5|Great for the price.
B00VXQBHGQ|5|Very nice. Customer service was amazing helping me get the correct set for my sled.
B00IBOSGKS|3|I purchased this product after reading the reviews and asking about the fit for a Scion FR-S 2016.  I was told that this was a perfect fit however I can say, after receiving and installing the product, that the fit is not perfect in both the driver side and rear passenger sections.  Firstly, when I opened the package and pulled out the product, I have to say that the materials felt a little more flimsy than I anticipated.  Now, since I have never owned a product like this, I cannot say if this is normal but I did expect something a little more solid in terms of construction with a little more weight to it.  In addition, the product arrived with some light scuffs on it; while this is minor to me because it is something that will happen during the life of the product, I suspect that others may find this a bigger issue.  Fit... The drivers side fits almost perfectly but fails to be &#34;custom&#34; to the 2016 model as there is a gap between the mat and the fuel cap release switch.  Additionally, don't try to place both the original mat and the new mat together as there is not enough room for the locking mechanisms to fit.  More significantly, the rear driver's side passenger mat does not fit accurately at all.  There are significant gaps between the driver seat rails and the mat in addition to having to ride the mat very high on the rear (against the rear passenger seats).  Fortunately, both the passenger and rear passenger-side mats fit almost perfectly with the only difference is having to ride the rear-passenger mat high against the rear passenger seats.  Now, I can't fault the product completely as it was stated that this was not deemed to be a perfect fit for a 2016 model; however, I can fault the reviewers who responded to my request to find out if it fit &#34;perfectly&#34; on a 2016 model.  Pros: - Fits (just not perfectly) - Should do the job of protecting the floor - Locking mechanisms fit perfectly - Velcro-type material on bottom will keep the mats in place  Cons: - Does not accurately fit a Scion FR-S 2016 - Feels flimsy - Arrived slightly scuffed
B00YWC7QPE|3|Clamps are (almost) not big enough for 1-1/4&#34; highway bars. Every part where a bolt is required is smooth, so parts will rotate if you place too much weight on them. These are not for bikes that vibrate a lot... I will be changing them out for something else eventually.
B008J4UMX4|4|Looks great but not easily fitted on the back plate... Chrome look great.
B004SWWUHC|5|Works greaT
B006K6P68O|5|Liner fit like a glove. Keeps cargo area clean. A lot cheaper that from dealer.
B000C5I6H2|5|These work great. They're just a pain in the @$$ to install.
B004WNUOHA|5|Ok
B000C7ZEFW|5|perfect
B0038KNJQ6|5|Greatest
B004EKYB7U|5|Great fit
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Awesome and bright. Great for the price.
B0086ZNB4S|1|Slide too easily
B0041CC89O|4|Foam is very comfortable, fits great around my full face helmet. Only problem is around under the eyes, it feels a little too tight. Other than that, pretty good, and a great price for the quality!
B005ZZH7G0|5|I love the product. Fits as advertised.
B00HSW008U|2|Color is not what I thought and the area I applied it on my leather shoes became hard and not supple the way the rest of the shoes are
B002LCD9XU|5|This has been on my car for quite some time now, endured all kinds of weather and temperatures; still looks like the day I put it on. Very easy to apply, and looks great. Very good quality!
B00407NK6A|5|Hardly noticeable; great to touch up scratches
B000BGOCOS|4|As adveftrised and on time. Could have used some gasket material to improve fit.
B00NQ05U24|5|These are pre-programmed for Toyota or any other OEM vehicle manuf.<br />These are NOT generic sensors that need to be told what type of vehicle they are installed on.<br />I bought this for my 2010 Highlander and had a local tire shop install it in the rim.<br />You MUST use special software or a hand held programmer to add them to your vehicles computer!<br />These will not magically add them selves to your vehicles computer.<br />Your vehicle will think this sensor is just another car near it, you MUST program your vehicle with the sensor number.<br />MAKE SURE you note the Sensor ID number, once in the tire it's virtually impossible to get that number again, which you will need to add it to the computer.<br /><br />I used TechStream to program this to my 2010 Highlander and even made a video of how I did it.<br />http://youtu.be/jrR78PogYw8
B00IWMX0BY|5|arrived when and as should have
B0009H527A|5|Installed in my 1972 BMW 2002.  It's definitely smaller than the filter I took out, but it seems to do the job fine.  No complaints.
B00YFG6G8A|5|Works fine with the LED BAR i bought but its longevity remains to be seen...
B000HCT0A2|5|Replaced the OEM rotor in my '72 BMW 2002.  Perfect fit, no complaints.
B009JWBGTY|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  It has a nice glow that can be seen in the dark.  I am using this for a sign for a theatrical performance and I get a nice glow off of this.  You will notice a buzzing (actually more like a humming sound), but overall it is perfect for my sign.  And I notice very little heat coming off of the wires.  Will buy again.
B008QZ6ARS|5|Great upgrade.
B00A82A4N8|5|Arrived quickly.  Fits in the allowed space.  Seems to work great (after 3 days).
B005HFXM30|5|Easy to program this Guage to work with any fuel system that changes resistance as your fuel tank empties.  It's basically 1 wire from your sending unit and 12v and ground. Super easy.  Took me 30 min total to put this on my buddies custom harley and now he knows how much fuel he has so he doesn't have to ride beeoch to the gas station anymore.  Highly recommend.
B00SDFFN2O|5|It helps, but it would be 100% better if it folded so you can kick your leg over when getting on. But, it is worth every dime. Ridding is a lot better for me with it than it was without it.
B00UPAS2HS|5|This item arrived very quickly and it's adorable.  Will definitely do more business with Decal Addiction.
B00K5TXCM4|5|Easy install and look great
B001L9ZO6Y|5|EXCELLENT.....
B0002ILK4K|5|Just what I needed at a great price!
B00LR8HOJE|5|my husband put them on, and they looks great. Just looking at them, you would think that the truck came from the factory already on. Installed in minutes.
B002IPODA8|5|The assembly fit as good as OEM and it came with all necessary parts. I was a little worried about the mirror itself, as it just snaps into place on a small mount inside the housing, but I've been driving with it for more than a month now without any issues. Definitely a good buy if you need one.
B00G6MQPBE|5|Gives my truck great power and 3 more mpg and I haven't even put an intake or exhaust yet. Shipping was crazy fast just make sure you email them your year and trans. Have bought one for every 7.3 I've owned you can't go without!
B000C9JS66|4|This and the Multi Port system made a big difference in my truck.<br />Recommended if yours has never been replaced.
B002OVYINS|5|performed very well! The shape was a little crooked, but VERY functional
B001UMZ07A|2|Don't use the spray to remove the compound.  It's terrible and will double your time.  The wax is good but again, don't use the spray to remove it like they say.
B001UOYNK8|5|works great
B0013EHV5O|5|Added the extra coolness my blue bug needed. 10/10 would recommend
B00JFALCVW|5|These visors fit my 2013 RAV4 LE perfectly. I installed all 4 in approx. 15 minutes. If you need a quick how-to, check out some short videos on youtube. This job is best done with two people. One person to sit in the car to (eventually) close the windows and the other person to install the visors. Open all 4 windows, be sure to use the abrasive pad provided to roughen up the area where you will attach the tape strips. Then wipe the area clean with the little alcohol pads provided. Peel the cover off the tape, then, using both hands, carefully align the visor with the window opening and push the tape strip part of the visor up into the window channel, applying upward and outward pressure, hold it on place for a few seconds. Have the  person sitting in the vehicle slowly raise the window. Be sure to get your fingers out of the way before the window is all the way up! Done. Don't  open the windows for about two full days to allow the tape to completely stick.<br />I've had these installed for 6 weeks now without any issues. Highly recommend this product.
B00UVY4N62|5|40 year old vinyl...looks like new again...easy to use
B013SXIE4E|5|100% recomendded
B00CZ4VFOE|4|I ride a 2014 street glide with a 3/4 helmet.  The boomless mic works very well indeed.  I needed something for my GPS and this works far better than expected.  The rider to rider communications also worked very well, I'm not a big fan of bluetooth technology.  There is a fair amount of engine noise that is picked up but not enough to really bother me.  Installation in my 3/4 helmet was easy and even easier in my wife's full helmet.  I also found it very easy to switch the intercom on and and off while riding to get rid of the ambient noise.  The intercom will override my music when my wife wants to talk.  I will say this works far better that any device I have used in the past.  Overall I'm happy with the product and would say it works well for my needs.  I haven't tried talking on my phone yet, not a big priority when I ride, but I don't anticipate any issues with that as everything else works as advertised.
B0009IQZFM|5|Dries great!
B009DJMNDG|5|Fit perfectly and arrived without any damage. Exact match to the OEM fender.
B008Y3OQSW|5|Perfect fit
B00FG55LKI|5|I received the locks quickly and was easy to install. I would recommend this product.
B0013T7OL0|1|Wanted to replace my existing seat cushion with the Wagan model and it does not equate!! To thin and wanted to exchange for a better model.<br />Will not purchase the Wagan model again!!!
B00008RW9V|5|This is great for the dash of my truck.  keeps it clean between washes
B000HBNTXW|5|As described, great price and fast shipping
B002TZBVWA|5|Oh wow...what a great filter.
B00EHE7V3Y|5|These mirrors are great and the service was even better.
B004P5YJM6|5|Have this mounted to the dash of my truck, love it.  Fits all different sizes of cell phones.
B00Q0C8G4Y|5|Excellent product
B00JQ26CUK|5|Mine works great. Great time, all the time. I put it right outside the shower, so that I can tell the time in the shower.  It is inconspicuous and convenient.
B0063GKHPI|1|Did not work
B002YKQNL4|5|Exactly as advertised.
B005R4L9YA|1|Didn't fit my 2006 Hummer H3.  Mine is not a plug and play as stated.
B00FJUEO12|5|Great cart!
B000QFDCCC|5|meets my expectations
B00ECHN0O0|4|The lights are bright to look at, but don't give that bright light out to light up the area behind my trailer that I was hoping.
B00ND6SMHG|5|The decal is beautiful.  I have recommended to many friends.
B001PLM5TC|5|Excellent product, easy to use wigb great results.
B00JREPRJE|5|Bought these after my daughter lost a hubcap.  Perfect fit.  Looks better than the factory hub caps.
B00LC6YFFM|1|Buyer beware..,while these window stickers are nice looking they are useless on vehicle with tinted windows ..,.either I overlooked the info on purchase or it wasn't listed but these stickers must be applied from the inside of the vehicle which leaves it unreadable from the outside if you have tinted windows.
B004A6PLXG|5|exactly what I ordered. Installation was a breeze and fit was exact
B000O0O9JE|5|One of two bearings I had to replace and was over joyed to find the right one here and get it in.
B0066SHNH8|5|Works! Will buy again if needed
B00EA2DMJK|5|Looks a million times better than stock, Doesn't bounce around the way the factory antenna does and mild improvement in reception, I highly recommend..
B00K3G0E52|5|Awesome
B000CC0IRQ|5|Our friend loved it!
B001CF6MUY|5|Works exactly as advertised. Used it to mount my vipertech stungun/flashlight to the roll bar next to my head. Perfect fit, seems durable.
B000C02XNA|5|Quiet braking, firm braking; just what 300 HP begs for.
B0002KM5NI|5|Nice kit.
B00RUZRZNI|5|Just installed in my 2001 Toyota Corolla.  Replaced the original OEM shocks at 130,000 miles.  The ride quality has greatly improved.  I would recommend these struts / springs.  Great price.
B0009A0IMQ|5|Best there is - results like no other wax.  Easy to apply and terrific protection.  Have used this product for years on high end automobiles and NEVER have been disappointed.  Price is excellent too.
B002XET49Y|5|Perfect fit. Cheap and durable.
B00BFDFP60|5|2001 Honda Accord EX-L V6. My original radiator cap broke, found this one, fit like a charm.
B00AZR3PBO|5|This work well on almost everything. Thin and durable. Looks clean and classy. Sticks and stays!!! Wish they made other colors  (gold and black ) that work this well.
B005IYQ1M4|5|wonderful :) RED not PINK  :)
B00NQ6GE1Y|5|I love sex wax, and I love the scent. This is a perfect way to make your room or car smell like a surf shop. I get packs of these every couple of months or so. Love them  They have messed up my order before and sent the correct product in addition to the wrong one. Great customer service from the guys at BC Surf & Sport. Very impressed
B007K1Q3JO|5|Perfect fit!
B00BYOHVJE|1|One broke off the first day I was riding on the freeway, second one went the second time riding, I would not suggest these at all!
B001L9KI56|3|It works as it is advertised. It's a throttle assist and though it doesn't allow you to let go of the grip, it does allow you to relax your grip and not cramp up from longer rides.<br /><br />I use this on my Yamaha FZ6 but I only use it for when I am riding longer than 30 minutes on the highway. I don't use it all the time because frankly, its annoying to have on the bar. It promotes the accidental engaging of the throttle if you have to grab the brake quickly. Not a huge problem though, just something to be aware of. I will for sure be taking this on my trip out west next summer because it is pretty useful.<br /><br />If you can get a throttle lock that fits your bike, get it. It will be well worth the investment.
B003IS3HV0|3|Okay product. Nothing great for me.
B00XLX0E1I|5|Quality nice looking plate!
B00BFE1NIS|5|perfect fit
B00EZC2BBU|5|Works as expected!!!<br />Good deal.
B00AZ7WCUE|5|Fit perfectly in my 2014 Nissan titan
B00D96TWC4|5|I love this themed license plate cover. Easy to apply. Thank you.
B0053GIR1U|5|Every thing was first class . thanks alot!
B00Y1HS6GS|5|Product as described works great, easy step by step instructions to program to my 2001 Ford Expedition completed setup in about 5 minutes of walking out of my front door to the vehicle and back in the house.
B0056EFSYS|5|Nice lens, really wish it was available at the time when I originally purchased the IV2 936 helmet, however, I have a size medium/wine colored helmet, the lens looks great, fits perfectly, perfect tint, works great in the bright sunlight, no distortion, have not ridden at night yet but shouldn't be a problem. Thank you.
B008R0ZXPC|4|Really nice but these jackets run small. I'm 6,1 230 lbs had to get the 2XL. Fits great but if you are a gym rat I suggest 2 sizes up.
B007FF5VAC|4|Doing what it's suppose to do. Was easy to set up.
B00FTVJOSO|5|Thank you very much for these items, they are absolutely perfect. Wonderful seller too, very polite and helpful.
B005GEDM2S|5|This fit nicely on Mazda CX9 2008 GT to replace broken light we had.
B0041Q988E|5|Very happy with my yaffe bars.  Made a excellent choice.
B0013LJ4OS|5|This luggage rocks! Started off with one, now I have the whole set!
B009E9J1Y4|5|Fast shipping item as described!
B000CQVLAA|5|Fixed the squeal that I had when brakes were applied.<br /> The pads that were on the car had 2/3 of the material left but they squealed so much that my wife was too embarrassed to ride in the car. That was OK with me for a few months but I got lonely so I bought & installed these.<br />Nice & quiet when the brakes go on. Now my wife is riding with me again & it's not so quiet with her in the car. (think she will notice if I wear earplugs?)
B007REJTGI|5|While you can guess you trailer weight within a few hundred pounds based on everything you load, it's extremely hard if not impossible to know the tongue weight.<br /><br />In part you want to stay within the recommendation of your vehicle manufacturer but more importantly it has a great impact on the stability of the rig.<br /><br />This particular one works extremely well. I own a tow hauler so the cargo varies greatly but being able to know the tongue weight and redistribute the load accordingly helps a lot and generally makes for a much more pleasant towing experience.
B0083P3X58|5|Looks great on my f150
B00EECM5FI|5|The KENSUN Xenon lights were received on time in great condition. I installed them on my 2002 Audi Quatro, the installation was not difficult and the lights fit perfectly. These lights are great improvement over the existing OEM equipment. Very pleased with the product the price and the service.
B001G9NV0A|4|The Distributor cap was fine, but the rotor button was brown instead of black.  No big problem though.
B00B0YYVP0|5|It got here real quick and worked perfect
B002NEWUKO|5|Great little set at less than half the price of buying just one OEM new. I bought a 4 sets so I'd have extra in the event I tore one while replacing a fuel injector. I ended up only need the large standoff O-ring's from each set, but at $4 apiece or $16 for the set of 4 is a cheap insurance policy.
B0083POY10|2|The caps are cheaply made. The Mustang logo came off one cap while I installed them. Replacing them would be a nice thing.
B00KDOF03U|5|Lights look awesome, great quality, and the best price on amazon.  Thanks guys!
B00B4S2II4|5|Fit great
B00AWE0DHY|5|Fits like a glove
B00AC6Y6XY|4|Nice and small, yet large enough to configure my iPhone and GPS for roadside viewing.  It also makes a great chin rest when I need to get out of the wind on those long highway trips.
B00192HPOC|4|ok
B00BD4YH24|5|They are nice
B007NNKXHM|5|Quick and easy fix, shipped quickly and worked to clear-out the pesky Low Fluid warning notice in my 2008 Town and Country.
B000S2VZ6S|5|Fixed my cruise control on my 2008 Silverado
B0007RDVHA|5|Love this stuff
B007SKAKPU|5|This isn't the nicest scantool you can buy but it does what it's intended to do well. It will fetch codes pretty quickly, just don't expect it to be a professional scantool. It is very helpful for DIY diagnosing.
B000COMXCM|5|Great product to store your wheel lock key and spare lug OEM lug nuts.
B004GEFZBA|2|When I bought the product it was supposed to be gold. Unfortunately when I receive the package it was Chrome. Slightly disappointed
B000CQOIQE|5|Works for my gator!  I can turn it upside down if I want a little higher hitch, or leave it as pictured for a low tow.  I really like this.  Very sturdy.
B00REJXVEW|5|I put this on my ram 1500 with no problems and looks good on there. Happy with my purchase
B0094KT800|5|fits properly and looks great. quality appears to be top notch.
B001HBQDO8|5|4th can I have bought....will buy more goes a long way
B00695Q3P6|5|So easy to use. Would recommend
B004EBASAI|1|Ordered this and recieved red &#34;Accord&#34; keychain. Not happy :/
B00NGOTFSA|5|nice looking decal - sticks well and adds character to the boat or the vehicle that gets the boat to the water. I put mine on a tackle box, and have had more than one compliment.
B00U8695HK|2|Neutral is the word. It does nothing
B004HCOE8Q|5|Don't use without cleaning the car first. Best result comes after a compound polish.
B0002SRCMO|5|It works great, I used it with no problem.  Would recommend.
B00WDSVEE8|5|Great item. It covers my prescription eyeglasses entirely and gives protection from the sun as needed. it is even better than I expected.
B0024E6VOO|4|satisfied
B005CJ0824|4|Great product.
B00EHHV2OU|5|So I purchased this and it has performed very well. It does take a few minutes to dial into the sensors but then the range is plenty to hook my 30 foot 5th wheel to my truck without a booster. I opted for the pass through sensors rather than having to take the unit on and off each time I had to adjust air pressure.  A while back the charging unit migrated into the house by accident and so I didn't have it turned on. Sure enough, I got a flat and barely had time to get to the side of the highway without damaging my rims.  I can't help but think that I would have had more warning with the unit turned on as it has warned me when a tire started to overheat and  or needed its pressure adjusted in the past. The set up directions were easy to follow and if you written direction challenged the Truck System folks have a you tube video to help walk you through. I had no problem with the monitors staying on  or causing any problem with the normal valve stems for my 2002 F250 4x4  Diesel with Stock Size Cooper tires on it.  I did notice that I didn't get the Allen / security  screw tight enough on one which allowed it to turn.  Easily caught and fixed.  I keep the allen in the truck along with the charging unit which hopefully won't try to run in the house when I'm not looking again.  I looked around a fair amount before choosing this and the argument for real time and blow out monitoring along with the companies history with the trucking industry were major factors in my decision over the cheaper units that you might find.  From what I can see from other reviews this company stands behind the product too so you can buy with confidence.
B003JHFRPO|4|I would give this a 5 star except it is the wrong part. For anyone wanting to know what vehicle this is for, I am attaching a photo from the box with the vehicles listed and the WeatherTech part number. The Amazon site said this would fit our 2012 Ford Fusion, and it is the incorrect mat for that. We are returning it and have ordered #442991, which is the correct mat for our vehicle, instead.
B00YML13OU|3|Just one big magnet that you need to cut into three with a heavy duty scissors.
B000AMD18Q|4|really well build and it has a solid construction, but you have to make sure that where you are mounting it is smaller than need bc there is no room for tolerances
B000WJCL56|4|Exactly as advertised -- but they do tend to sag over time.
B003EOVI6Y|5|Fit just right, although I'm not sure why it wasn't included with the other mats when I bought them
B000BQ08BE|5|Works great.
B00J7RB72M|4|Not the best case I have owned, but worth the price.There is one reason I did not give it five stars. There are 120 vinyl pockets for holding the cds. You have to tear off the top on each pocket to make an opening to insert the cd. This should be done by the manufacturer, not the customer.
B00ZR51DSG|5|Not counterfeit, purchased from ItemsRUs and the code registered as authentic. Works as it should. Will buy again.
B000CCFY5W|5|works as advertised
B004VLKI5G|5|I orded the part and it arrived in the time frame quoted. Fitted perfect no Issues what so ever.
B001AV4CNO|5|Great deal .. Exact ones BMW sells at dealership ... But 4 for the price of 1!!
B00200SBAY|5|good stuff.  Good to wash out that radiator and block.
B00473KAHE|5|Easy to install. Does not leak 2015 Dodge Ram short bed. Awesome!!
B000O5FZNI|5|Installed on: 1998 Toyota Camry<br />Install time: ~45 minutes<br />Tools needed: 17mm Socket, 11/16 Socket, 12&#34; Driver Extension, Ratchet Wrench, 1/2&#34; Drill Bit, Variable Speed Drill, Tap Oil, 10mm-1.25 Pitch Tap, Torque Wrench<br />Optional tools: Jack and Jack Stands (depending on how low your vehicle is to the ground obviously if you jack it up stabilize it with jack stands).<br />People needed: 1 person plus a helper to hold the hitch in place or if you are handy you could probably rig something together with jack stands.<br /><br />The install on this Receiver Hitch is pretty straightforward. the 1998 Camry has four threaded holes (weldnuts) installed under the rear of the vehicle already. My car is a little older so I anticipated that the uncovered factory tapped holes would probably have a little bit of rust in the threads. I was correct. There was enough rust in the threads that it would have made it a painful install if I hadn't chased the holes first with my 10mm 1.25 pitch Irwin Tap [[ASIN:B0002JT0Y6 Irwin Industrial 10mm-1.25 Tap 8339]]. For reference I used an Irwin Industrial 1/4-1/2in T-hdl Tap Wrench [[ASIN:B00004YOB1 Irwin Industrial 1/4-1/2in T-hdl Tap Wrench 12002]] to move things along. Finally I used a light machine oil to lube up the Tap if you don't have any I like Tap Magic [[ASIN:B003X3ZKXI Forney 20857 Cutting Fluid, Industrial Pro Tap Magic, 4-Ounces]] works pretty awesome. This is essential or you will wind up snapping your tap and with a piece of hard tool steel snapped off in exactly the wrong place.  Spend the money on a good tap for this job. Let me reiterate their are plenty of cheap tools to use. Cheap taps are nothing but trouble. Remember if things get jammed up back out, clean the tool clean out the threads add more oil and run it through, repeat ad nauseum until it is smooth like butter. Time spent on this step will make the rest of the install go smoothly.<br /><br />This hitch has a total of 6 holes because 4 of the holes are pre existing [weldnuts] you will have to do a mock installation of the receiver hitch to mark / drill pilot holes for the U hangar that ties the last two holes into the hitch.  I used the 1/2&#34; Pilot Point drill bit out of my Dewalt set [[ASIN:B004GIO0F8 DEWALT DW1361 Titanium Pilot Point Drill Bit Set, 21-Piece]] I like this set because it is very sharp and the shaft of the drill centered the pilot point. Once I set my pilot points I pulled the receiver hitch back off and finished drilling the holes. I pulled the receiver hitch back off so I could thread the U hanger through my new freshly drilled holes. You may or may not have to do this. YMMV Batteries not included.<br /><br />After all this. The easy part was putting the hitch back on and tightening everything down. That took all of about 5 minutes after the prep work.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind. The receiver portion of this hitch will only take a 1 7/8&#34; size ball maximum. If you have toys that have larger balls on them you will have to consider having the hitch modified or using a different hitch.  The receiver is 1 1/4 in square size so if you are buying bike racks or other items keep that in mind. Class II receiver.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />This item was shipped to Amazon via FedEx without a box. Amazon shipped it to me in a box. It is a big piece of steel and even with all the packing material around it, it did what a big piece of steel in a box does. It poked holes through the box. Was the receiver hitch a little scratched up? Sure *shrugs shoulders* It is on the bottom of my car and it is going to get sand blasted by dirt and road debris. I does not really bug me. All of the parts arrived and that is what is important. I hit it with a spot or two or rattlecan black and it as good as new or as much as I care.
