8590379825|5|When I bought this book, as soon as I opened it I fell in love.  It brought back memories of how wonderful the K&R book on C was.  If you want to learn Lua, and you enjoy a no-nonsense approach to learning a language, this book is for you.  There's not a single page wasted.
B007BVOEPI|5|This series is amazing. From the costumes to the beautiful scenery. The story line is awesome. It keeps you needing to know what will happen next!
B00HEPE28U|3|Here are a few givens before I start:<br /><br /> 1. I have read the book 47 Ronin, visited the gravesite several times in Minato-ku, and my main hobby is Japanese culture.<br /> 2. Hiroyuki Sanada is one of my favorite actors working today.<br /> 3. Keanu Reeves, well, no.<br /><br />When I heard a few years ago that Reeves was going to make this a movie, failure was my first thought.  I kept reading about delays, then no news, then more delays.  A premier date was finally set and I told a couple of my friends to keep that date open.  I also warned them it was going to suck.  When the date arrived, it didn't even show anywhere in my area.  Another bad sign.<br /><br />Fast forward to a release date on 3D Blu-ray and I placed my order.  I have to say that its not the greatest movie by a longshot, but I didn't think it was horrible be any means. It looks very good in 3D and that is its strongest point.  Not stunning, but good.<br /><br />Some of the acting is a little flat.  Its always hard to watch Japanese actors who are not native English speakers tackle the language difference.  Sanada-san does well but it seemed a little stretched for the other cast members, some of whom are big stars in Japan.<br /><br />My big fear was that the much loved in Japan story of the 47 Ronin was going to get butchered right to the bone.  This is a fantasy movie and I was surprised that they were able to apply the main points of the story to the movie.  Of course there is the required for a movie love story, but surprisingly it doesn't get in the way of what this movie is about.<br /><br />Its not the best but I think if you like fantasy movies its worth giving it a watch.  I'd give 2 ½ stars instead of 3 but that option isn't available.  Watch it in Blu-ray if at all possible, 3D really makes it better.
0316921173|5|Infinite Jest contains so much life, humor, zest, despair, and just plain oddness it leaves you breathless trying to recommend it to a friend. It's hard work, sure. But it's ever so worth it. Vaults to the top with Lolita,  Gravity's Rainbow (or maybe Mason &amp; Dixon), Brothers Karamazov, and  Light in August. A masterpiece. (So where does DFW go from here...?)
B003MYYJD0|5|Nice Watch... I get a lot of people asking me about it....
0316666343|4|This book intrigued me from the very beginning.  I tend to enjoy novels dealing with the relationship between the living and the dead and this was a remarkable example of just that.  Ms. Sebold portrays the afterlife as a very personal experience - to each his/her own heaven ... or hell, for that matter.  Susie, who was murdered at 14 years old, chooses to observe her family for many years, witnessing the effect that her death had on the lives of those she left behind. <br />There were times when the book was a bit creepy, making me think that some dead person was watching my every move in a voyeuristic sort of way. And reading about the actions of a serial killer made me worry about my own children ...But it dealt so wonderfully with the process of mourning and letting go in times of great loss and it was also so marvelously suspenseful in certain parts that it was still a great read!
B007HGPBRC|4|Interesting to see how hitch was feeling towards the end of his life.  He stood strong till the end and was a great man who fought for what he believed in!
B00FAX6XQC|4|The game is real life like.It's an addictive game.Just wished you could sell the old guns .You don't use them after you move to another region.And you could use the money to buy more upgrades or a better weapon.
B005LAIISA|5|As all the Ice Age movies have been,Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a movie to be loved by all ages. For the younger ones, the cartoon anamation is a real hit, but for older viewers, the story behind all of these movies has an underlying story and a theme to be loved by all viewers.
B00A4GXJD0|5|Outstanding except the rap song which sucked, Mr. Rock 'n Roll is his best song ever! Plus no ripping off of other songs.
1878424319|4|Great, simple . I bought it at the same time as Live Like A Fruit Fly which I also recommend to anyone who likes these types of books.
B000UYBPDW|5|BEST YET
B00I2TV3NO|5|Lots of action, really good stunts,  great special effects. Over all the storyline leaves you angry at the bad guys.
B00DR0PDNE|5|good pakeged~
B00AIUUXHC|4|I really like the game, it's engaging and entertaining, however for some reason my game resets. So far I have two different games I'm playing and I never know which one it will be when I load up. :/
0399226907|5|This book is lots of fun for kids.  I recommend it.
0061992860|4|Be aware..the book is small.. tough to read but fits easily in a pack or most pockets.<br />The layout of the SAS Guide is easy to follow and crammed with information.<br />If you want a general inclusive survival guide, this is it. If you want one specific to a certain area, you may want to purchase a more in-depth one.
B00BWBHIUG|5|Want your children to have fun while learning? Then this is the game for them.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This is one of the best games i have ever played. Cool bosses and mobs and really fun in hard mode.
B00J0LH0XK|5|Excellent price
B000PC0U1W|2|A bizarre blending of Zorro, The Phantom of the Opera and 1984 - only this time John Hurt is playing Big Brother - all in the style of the TV cult series of the sixties, The Avengers. Sadly, Natalie Portman is no Mrs Peel! It's mildly diverting but anyone looking for something really deep and meaningful will be wasting his or her time. Not an original idea on show.
B002LC8HF0|5|All I can say about this book is that it perfectly concludes a near-perfect series. This is the first work of Sanderson's that I've read and I'm going to read everything else of his that I can get my hands on. He is a genius! I tend toward urban fantasy and even a little ya paranormal romance, but this series blew that out of the water. I cannot wait to see what else Mr. Sanderson has in his repertoire. If all of his books are as good as this series, he is now my new favorite writer (sorry Ms. Austen).
B005DZMNHA|4|New tunes,good energy from the standard that we have come to respect and enjoy.Chris does a great job on it.
B001ILFUDC|5|Classic Pinnochio movie.  Purchased for our grandson, he loves the movie.  It helps develop life attributes such as honesty and integrity and trustworthyness.
B007ZD17XO|5|Wow...what a fun game.  I've had this game sitting in my carousel  all alone for a long time.  For some reason, I decided to try it; and boy was I surprised.  The graphics are exciting and the play was contagious.  I know I'll be playing this game many, many times a day and night.  I hope anyone that may read this will check it out cause I know you'll enjoy it.
B00932A66Y|5|A very good adaptation from an excellent book.  I was satisfied with most of the details in the movie--I would definitely recommend it to thriller fans.
B0007939NO|5|Brigadoon is an entertaining MGM musical even if budget cuts made them shoot the film in California and not in Scotland as director Vincente Minnelli and star/choreographer Gene Kelly wanted. True, it's not quite the same as the Broadway production, but as a film adaptation of the Broadway play this is excellent. The acting is very convincing; and the choreography by Gene Kelly is outstanding. The cinematography is pretty good, too, although during the \\"Almost like Being in Love\\" number Gene Kelly is filmed too far away from the camera. The sets are great but as others have noted it's obvious that the background is painted and not real. The plot moves along well and there's an element of suspense that enhances the picture along with a fine musical score. There is also the contrast between the hurry up modern day world especially in a huge, impersonal city as opposed to a much simpler life with an emphasis on cherishing loved ones.<br /><br />When the action begins, we meet two American buddies who came to Scotland to hunt grouse and other birds; Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) is really there to postpone his wedding to Jane (Elaine Stewart) back in New York while Tommy's hard-drinking buddy Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson in an acerbic role) is truly there to hunt. However, when Tommy and Jeff get lost and they find a town rising out of the mist one morning--a town that's not on any map--they decide to visit the town and find out more about it.<br /><br />Tommy and Jeff discover they're in Brigadoon; but still no one will tell them why the townsfolk don't dress in modern day clothing and why it's not on any map! In addition, Tommy meets Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse); Fiona's sister Jean (Virginia Bosler) is to be married that day to Charlie Chisholm Dalrymple (Jimmy Thompson).<br /><br />Finally, Tommy and Jeff are told by Mr. Lundie (Barry Jones), a respected elder of Brigadoon, that the village appears for only a single day once every one hundred years! Their departed minister Forsyth wanted it that way to protect Brigadoon from horrible witches--and more. Mr. Lundie also tells Tommy and Jeff that if anyone should want to stay and join them in Brigadoon they would be welcomed; but nobody can ever leave Brigadoon without terrible consequences for them all. At the same time, Tommy is falling in love with Fiona who feels the same way about Tommy.<br /><br />I won't tell you much more to avoid giving out spoilers; I've already left out some of the plot so you can appreciate this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that Lerner and Loewe's musical numbers are all wonderful. The DVD comes with three outtakes of musical numbers (\\"Come to Me Bend to Me;\\" \\"From This Day On\\" and the excellent \\"Sword Dance\\"); we get the audio from \\"There But for You Go I.\\"<br /><br />Look also for particularly solid performances by Hugh Laing as Harry Beaton; Eddie Quillan as Sandy; Dodie Heath as Meg Brockie and Albert Sharpe as Andrew Campbell.<br /><br />Brigadoon is a fine MGM musical with a beautiful musical score; excellent acting and dancing; suspense and even more. I recommend this for fans of classic movie musicals; fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this sentimental and romantic film to their collections.ter Forsyth wanted it that way to protect Brigadoon from horrible witches--and more.

B004P7CNUY|5|I was so excited to get this movie. This was the only 1 I didn't have out of the Halloween movie's. It came fast and it excellent condition
B00AGE20ZI|5|We watched this classic during the holiday season. It was warm, witty and it sent a simple message appropriate for this season. Beautifully photographed, the charming 'minor' characters, the gentle story all created a satisfying movie viewing experience. So nice to not have pyrotechnics, cgi effects, etc that bloat today's movies. The writers knew how to tell a story and told it well.
B00P54AKPG|4|Let me start off first and say that I normally don't care for this type of genre. For me the time travel stories tend to be over dramatic or not make sense. I was completely shocked to find that I actually enjoyed it. Some parts didn't quite make sense to me but I think it is about breaking down who is what and who did what to get to where they were at that brought the main characters together. I don't want to give spoilers so that was why that statement was quite vague. Basically this book is about sacrifice, love, selflessness, and determination. Fighting for what you believe in to get to a goal you want to achieve. In this case, all was for Anna.<br /><br />Just a warning that if you don't like books that you have to think or imagine deeper meanings then this is not the book for you. This is a paranormal book so take that and the fact that involves time travel into consideration as well. BUT don't discount the fact that sometimes reading outside of what you are use to can bring you to a great book. (Which I can say happened in my case) Yes the writer had warnings about the book but I never felt they were anything that was too graphic to bother someone but am impressed that the author has made a point to note it on the safe side.
B00FRQ32N4|5|This is a really fun game I really enjoy playing it. I would even suggest it to all my friends to play.
B00002Z88D|5|The lyrics are great, the vocals bust! the percussion a must and the strings are heavy, Love it!
B0017I1FO4|5|Before this album, I mainly knew Shinedown from their singles, \\"45\\" and \\"I Dare You\\", which I liked, but not enough to buy the respective albums.  After hearing and loving \\"Second Chance\\" and \\"Breaking Inside\\" on Pandora, I was surprised to find those songs were by the same band, and I downloaded a couple more songs from the album (\\"Devour\\" and \\"Sound of Madness\\") before giving in and just buying the whole thing.  I did not regret it.    Pros: Pretty much every song on it is excellent; no filler.  Sin with a Grin is the only track I'm not that crazy about.  Excellent hooks and catchy choruses will get these tracks inside your head, guaranteed.  There is a good mix of harder, heavier tracks (Devour, Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide) with lighter ones (Second Chance, Call Me), but Shinedown is consistently able to avoid getting bogged down and sludgy, unlike some other hard rock groups that I won't name.  Even the slower tracks have energy and drive behind them.    Cons: I wish the album was longer.  Only 11 tracks at about 3-4 minutes each means it clocks in at less than 45 minutes.  But better short and sweet than full of filler.    I can't recommend this album highly enough, and I will definitely be watching for Shinedown's next album.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This game is great, but floppy bird is better. The bird poops and I don't know why. Why did floppy bird get deleted. Not bad though
B001MM28JG|5|AWESOME!!!! & FUN ENTERTAINING!!!
B00947N6D8|5|This is a must see & a must have. Love love love this flick! It is very special and in a class all of its own.
B002MQYOFW|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was horrifying what they expected of young people and it is very dark to even think that something like this could happen. That is the hardest thing about this story, the total disconnection of real life and the Games. I gave this rating because it was well written and pulled me in right away and made me care about the main characters.
B0000C7PRY|5|En español: Ex-ce-len-te. Si te gusta la música épica, el metal o el rock progresivo, más allá de que el cambio de tu moneda con respecto al dólar te favorezca o no, este disco es una obra de arte. <br />In english: <br />This CD is great. Is the natural evolution of the best song of Transatlantic, &quot;Stanger in your soul&quot;. It's like some kind of autobiography, with all the humours, the ups&amp;downs that could take place in any life: from sadness to happiness, from sunset to sunrise... Maybe I don't take religions as seriously and deeply as Neal  do; I 'd rather prefer to believe that there's is a God/Energy/Supreme being that let us live in freedom, reaching the path of wisdom as we grow older. Unfortunately, Religions&amp;gouvernments through out the history of mankind always lead us into war... (Irak, First&amp;Second World War, The inquisition, etc). Beside the religious tinge of this magnificent cd, surrounded with very epic&amp;classical strings, there's the unsurpassable fierce of Mike Portnoy's Drumming. He's one of the greatest drummers of all time. As I said, to me this CD is the evolution of a song, in the same sense I'd like to say that Mike Portnoy is the evolution of Bonzo, The XXI century's John Bonham. If you're into epics, buy it!
B000ICM5VW|5|Great movie, Great HD transfer. Obviously ignorant reviews are rating the dvd based on their lack of shopping skills. If it's cheaper a Walmart, buy it at Walmart!
B00NCGXYJS|3|I really enjoy this cd of Bette Midler. I have been a fan of hers for a long time. The songs are all about love; a bit old fashioned but if you belong to an older generation and a fan of Bette Midlers you will enjoy this cd.
B000002UB6|3|Like SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, LET IT BE has been the subject of such heated debated and intense scrutiny over the years that the album itself is almost overlooked in all the hub-bub.<br />LET IT BE was, for years, my favorite Beatles LP. Looking back I realize it is because LET IT BE, along with certain moments on RUBBER SOUL and much of the WHITE ALBUM, allows listeners to feel as close as possible to the Beatles. Beginning with \\"Two Of Us,\\" most of LET IT BE sounds as if the Beatles are sitting with you in your living room, playing just to play.<br />Of course, there are moments destoyed by Phil Spector. \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" a nice little ditty by McCartney, sung and accompanied by piano, is turned into a nightmarish, sugary-sweet power ballad by Spector, who soaked the tapes in syrup and sprinkled sugar and a cherry on top. McCartney was furious, and had ever right to be. <br />That's a real shame, since McCartney is the only Beatle who seems to have put any effort into LET IT BE. Lennon is virtually non-existant, providing only odd one-liners that nobody laughs at, and confusing lyrics that are neither poetic nor meaningful. Harrison plays poorly, over-relying on a bad fuzz box. Even Ringo, who is the heart of all great Beatle music, seems disinterested, coming to life briefly on \\"Let It Be.\\"<br />If LET IT BE does nothing else, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that George Martin was a vital, irreplaceable piece of the Beatles. Without him, the band floundered.
B00003CXSP|5|a ok
0385493622|5|YET ANOTHER SINGH MASTERFUL HISTORY. I have enjoyed a number of Singh's books on the history of science, so when I saw this I bought it immediately. I was not disappointed.    I don't really understand his details about elliptic equations, modular forms, etc., nor do I have any particular interest either in understanding such materials or advanced math.  But as a historical treatment the book is much more about people than maths. Like Singh's books about the history of science, this details the trials and tribulations and real-world problems of people involved in the quest, such as historical prejudice against females in academia, funding problems, and even religious and political persecution resulting from *math* opinions! It also provides an interesting \\"behind-the-scenes\\" view of academia.
B002PNKXLG|5|Great family movie.
B008TMA1LY|5|this is a very fun app! It is free and lots of fun!!! Reccomened probably for ages 7 and up because sometimes it can be kind of overwhelming but other than it totally awesome!
B00499QUK2|5|I enjoyed the show. It was well written and has talented actors.  I am looking forward to seeing more episodes of the series.
B00JJHDX9A|4|It is a bit lengthy, but as a life long fan, I really can't bag on it. Was entertained, but not moved.
B000AL730O|5|Great cd!  Bought it fit one particular song and loved the whole cd.  Very hdppy with it.  Came in good condition.
B00KA87GCW|4|Good so far. Mainly just doing it cause it's one of the quests.
B00NWLIW0E|5|Awesome I paid full price but needs more maps and goats please as a fan request make a t.rex goat think it would be awesome and in coffee stains are going to make an update for this game please add more goats I know your working on momore goats but help us other people on mobile and please update other than that AWESOME game and love it
0525423656|3|~~* Possible spoilers *~~ I absolutely adored \\"Matched.\\" I thought it held intrigue, romance, and all of the qualities of a very well-written story. I pre-ordered \\"Crossed\\" and was so excited to get started reading. About half way through the book, though, I found myself wondering when it was going to get started. Overall, it seems I've just read 255 pages worth of filler. Unfortunately Condie fell into the pit hole that many authors of a trilogy series do- she's written a 2nd book that seems to serve simply as a bridge, with none of the character development and plot intrigue of a truly successful novel. Of course there are aspects of the novel which are important, and key ingredients of the story were introduced, but the character of Cassia, who I saw grow and change significantly during the first novel, seemed stagnant and boring. The dynamic between her and Ky was dull. Xander, who seemed to be the only character with a significant secret revealed, was hardly in the story at all, though he was mentioned almost every single waking thought Cassia had. The prose, however, was beautifully written, much more poetic and inspired than the first.  Overall, I think \\"Crossed\\" holds a few very minor important plot points, but was majorly overstated. Once I was done reading I felt a bit cheated, having spent the time following Cassia's journey, only to have her end up practically right back where she started. Everything I was interested in seeing resolved in \\"Crossed\\" was stretched out and beaten, left hanging for the 3rd piece of the trilogy.  Despite this, I am still very much looking forward to the last novel of the series, where I will finally get to see the conclusion of the exciting story Condie began with \\"Matched.\\"
B00121QGUY|5|Purchased for my library.
B003MC5N28|2|For me the story was a little boring.  I used wikipedia to read about the book and the author, and decided it really was a YA book.  It was interesting at first, but for some reason I quickly lost interest.  Perhaps I simply wasn't the audience the book aimed for.
1591843162|5|This book is an excellent look at the future that's being created as we speak. It's an invaluable lens into the motivations and machinations that are driving us forward. Nothing I've seen describes the new way that work is beginning to take place better.
B0059XTV4Y|5|This story is the most romantic thing I have ever heard.  Thanks to Madonna we get a tender perspective on the sacrifice that was made for the sake of true love.  If you like romance this ones a winner.
B00HDMMISA|5|Our book club took this apart and no one expected the outcome of the ending and the change in character personas. Well written, although the Greek chorus is annoyingly distracting and doesn't enhance the flow of the book. Very important and relevant topic for all ages.
B00G9B1MEM|5|Awesome game from for both kiddos and those kids at heart
B001IXXYBA|5|The movie is believable.  This isn't a movie you watch; it's a movie you live.  The action and suspense never stop.
B000002UDV|5|I would just like to say that Pet Sounds is my favourite album, and for many reasons: (1) Its musical sophistication and beauty, molded by Brian Wilson's natural gifts, represent THE pinnacle of good music; (2) The whole  album is one complete movement, from the beginning harpsichord notes of  &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; to the last barks from Banana and Louie on  &quot;Caroline, No&quot;; (3) Even today, it is a work well in advance of  its time. <br /> I could go into many more reasons, citing examples from every  song, but that would detract from any potential listener's experience of  the album.  There is a 1000 word limit to these reviews, but 1000000 words  couldn't even describe Pet Sounds accurately.  My final point--just listen  to it!
B00321SMFO|4|My four-star rating is for the series itself, not how it looks on my method of viewing (Amazon Instant on the PS3).  The series is great.  It's a little heavy on the dramatization of predator/prey interactions for my taste, but other than that it's phenomenal.<br /><br />Just a warning, though, don't watch this on Amazon Instant in HD if you expect those stunning visuals everybody talks about.  Close shots and slow shots will indeed be amazing.  Panoramic shots often have visible compression artifacts and anything with many animals or birds has TERRIBLE compression artifacts (squares, blocks, blurring, \\"mosquito noise\\" - basically like a really bad Youtube video).<br /><br />It's not our connection.  The PS3 has priority and I've watched to make sure nothing was interfering - Amazon was delivering video at less than the max rate we could do at the time of day (which is normal).  But the \\"HD\\" stream simply cannot handle a fair number of scenes in this program and it's fairly disappointing.<br /><br />One other nitpick, too - the audio mix is really weird on these episodes.  Voiceovers can be hard to hear and the whole soundtrack has an odd quality to it.<br /><br />We haven't had these issues with Amazon Instant Video on other movies/TV we've watched.  I did send feedback to Amazon.
B0083SBJXS|5|This is, by far and away, the best conversion of a comic into a movie.  Joss Weadon (the director) did a magnificent job of translating comics from the 1960s into a live action movie.  Script, acting, production are all first class!  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Marvel studios appear to own the Superhero movie market.<br /><br />If you want to watch a comic book superhero on the big screen, you can't do better than this movie.  Buy 2 today.
B008673ZAQ|5|it was very good book can't wait till May 26 when last book comes out so overall it was a good book
B0009P5YXO|5|Daughter loves Dr. Who and everything associated with it.  We got her this as a gift.  It is just a novelty item that lights up and makes noise but she loves it.
B002XWTKC2|5|Great throwback. Funny and action packed. 2 thumbs up!
0385512058|4|Keith made this book interesting for me. I got to admit that some parts were pretty boring, but for most of it, it is pretty interesting. Keith tells you about a lot of his experiences and how he works his way up into being a more successful person. It is quite interesting to read about the people that he meets and how it inspired him. His family background will surprise you. I don't want to give anything away, but I thought this book was pretty good and it is definitely something worth reading. This book was recommended by a company owner and he said he told his employees to read this. Therefore, I gave it a shot.
B00J2VSS0C|3|The worst thing about it is how to get out after you are done playing.
B0018QQQK8|5|i havent read this book yet but i love this guy he has made thee best books have you read  the gaurdain? it is the cutest book ever!!(=

B00BD99JMW|3|After reading the trilogy, i was thoroughly disgusted at the ending. It made the whole thing seem like a waste of time.
B000002JEV|5|BBC Sessions shows the white-blues side of Led Zeppelin, a side of them that only showed itself on occasion. In these live sessions, they perform awesome versions of their blues tunes, (You Shook Me, Since I've Been  Loving You, I Can't Quit You Baby) and some other classics that only appear  on this collection (Travelling Riverside Blues, Somethin' Else, Boogie  Chillun). But Zeppelin never ceases to let their more dominant hard rock  side come out and play (Heartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love, Communication  Breakdown, Dazed and Confused). There's something here for everyone, the  blues fans and the hard rock fans. My favorite part of BBC Sessions is the  little acoustic bit where Zep does a wonderful Going To California then  goes straight into the beautiful That's The Way. All fans of Led Zeppelin  should own this.
B000F9RB9Y|5|Arnold is Arnold, the rest is the rest, no other comments necessary, he brings the best of his character, and also is in great shape.
B003BA4CAU|2|Movie was only so so
B00EFWU91E|3|After the first five books with these characters I have to admit I was getting a little sick of Clary.  She proves herself to be self centered and immature most of the time.  However, I really enjoyed these stories and all of the other characters but this book really did not do any of them justice.  Below is a list of just a few things that irritated me:<br /><br />1.  The entire book was a commercial for Clare's other series.<br /><br />2.  At some point, someone REALLY needed to tell Clary to quit whining.<br /><br />3.  Jace didn't bring enough food or water to the demon realm but he just HAPPENED to have a condom?  That's just ridiculous.<br /><br />4.  The ending was too perfect for everyone, in all these epic battles that we have seen thoughout this series there should have been SOME kind of sacrific...somewhere.  Instead, Jordan's dead and Maia doesn't really care and Simon gets to have his memories back.<br /><br />5.  First Sebastian wants to control the world, then he wants to burn it down, then he just wants the demon realm while he has some sort of incestual threesome with Jace and Clary.  His character doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Now for the things I enjoyed:<br /><br />1.  I thought she did an excellent job developing Magnus and Alec's characters.  Alec seems to be the only one who matured throughout this series.<br /><br />2.  The story was well told, if a little wordy.  The POV shifts really didn't bother me as they seem to have others.  I enjoyed the opportunity to see the world through others' eyes.  Sometimes I wish other authors used that technique as liberally as Clare does.<br /><br />3.  Jace is still funny.  Not as funny as Will, but funny.  Jace and Simon together are even funnier.<br /><br />4.  It was a good wrap up to these characters' lives, even if I thought it was too sugary sweet.  She was careful to let us know where things would be going next.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the things I have disliked about her last several books haveoutweighed the things I have liked so I doubt I will be reading about Emma Carstairs and the others.
0800141660|5|A beautiful rendition of the book.  JANE AUSTIN would be proud.
B00G3L6KQI|5|The third book in this trilogy makes you long for a fourth book!  The history and the weaving of the past and present in this book is fascinating.  It has an ulterior message that is woven through all the books but more so in this last one.  If you love Twilight, Fifty Shades (the relationship) and Harry Potter this is a must read for you.  Thank you Deborah Harkness for writing an intellectually stimulating historical trilogy!
B00687PWQG|5|Phenomenal story of the history of not only John Adams, but the United States of America as a whole. I've read about the inaccuracies and find them to be trivial and minute. Great series!
B001NEK2GE|2|World of Warcraft from Blizzard Entertainment has been around over 5 years now and I've played all of them. I have always used a regular keyboard until a year ago. I had a Merc Stealth with the gamepad on the left but the software was out of date and had errors. So I tried this LOGITECH G13 programmable gameboard w/LCD display and I didn't like it. Since it's free standing, it's really a remote keyboard. I found it difficult to get used to the layout even after a couple of weeks. When the dungeon fights got really intense, I found the keyboard was no harder and jumped to it to survive.<br />I use a LOGITECH Illuminated keyboard 820-001268 that is very flat and short-throw keys that push with a precise light touch. It works great for WoW.

B00DQC2FPM|5|I bought this as a holiday present for my 8 year old grandson. In the past, I've bought him a few Lego kits and he really enjoys building them by himself.

B00004RF83|5|This is one of the great movies of the cold war era. The acting by Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglass et al is superb. One of the things that I rarely do is watch the director's clip on the making of a movie. This movie is one that you must do so. To listen to Frakenheimer describe the how he was able to get JFK's permission to film in front of the White House; the discussion about the riot scenes...well just buy the movie, you won't be sorry.

B00BEZTMQ8|5|When The Hobbit was released I read most of the reviews and got instantly depressed. The movie was slow. The movie was dull. The movie was bad. Almost everyone who eventually went to see The Hobbit went in spite of the critics and those wretched reviews. As I watch the blu-ray version of The Hobbit for the third time, I can't help asking anyone who'll listen: what on Earth were the critics watching? What movie did they see and we missed? The Hobbit is a bit more detailed than LOTR, that is true. I think Peter Jackson was responding to those lovers of Tolkien's books who missed some of the whimsy, some of the poetry, some of the songs found in Tolkien that was left out of the three LOTR films out of necessity. So Jackson gives us some of the songs and whimsy and the critics (most of whom have never read any of Tolkien's books) complain. The Hobbit is a brilliant and exciting film. The two follow-up films promise to be even better as they conclude The Hobbit story and begin Sauron's rise in Mirkwood as The Necromancer. As for the critics: perhaps that's why they write about films rather than make them.

0553801503|5|More violence, more sex, and more mystery make this a very worthy sequel to a Storm of Swords - even if it was not quite as good on the whole as its predecesor. (How can any book be as good as Storm of Swords I ask?) Buy this book, and prepare to be amazed by Martin's world...<br /><br />I will confess that I had a slightly hard time getting into this book, not because the story was poor, but rather that it concerned points of view from \\"new\\" characters that I don't care as much about as say Dany or Tyrion... That being said, once the book got going it more than delivers.<br /><br />Cersei Was by far the best story line in her search to kill \\"The Imp\\", and young Sansa, all the while plotting against everyone who she sees as a threat. (Which for Cersei is almost everyone) Cersei was never one of my favorite characters before, as she was too evil, but now she is right up there with Tyrion. Jamie is hard at work trying to secure the Lannister lands after the Death of his father, and adapting to his new life without his sword-hand. Brienne continues her quests bestowed upon her by Lady Catelyn, with the aid of the Kingslayers blade. She encounters many old friends and foes in her travels. Anya...well she is still \\"Anya underfoot\\" making her way all over Westeros and beyond, avoiding notice, and getting into mischief.  Sam Tarly is sent on a very important Sea voyage by the Lord Snow with the 102 year old Maester Aemon to accompany him...<br />Petyr Baelish is in the Eyrie with Sansa and the sickly Lord Robert, and his intentions are beginning to show that his ambitions are far greater than he has let on...<br /><br />As I mentioned, it was difficult to start the book, as it focuses on the Damphier of Greyjoy and his family, and the people of Dorne. However, I should be clear that looking back, I anticipate a great clash when these nations take a bigger part in the \\"Game of Thrones\\" after all, \\"when you play the game of thrones, either you win, or you die.\\"<br /><br />Relic113

0312305060|2|I read this book, based on its Pulitzer prize status and it being a feminist story, however, I was disappointed.  It was very well written and had a few lovely and poetic parts, but mostly it was full of unhappy, depressed, hopeless gay people who I could not sympathize with in any way.  They were either unable to accept and live with being gay or couldn't figure out how to get help or antidepressant meds.   I couldn't understand what was the point of all the angst and misery.  The theme seemed to be \\"life is hopeless and terrible, and if you are lucky, you may get a few good hours in a lifetime\\".  Very big downer.  I won't see the movie.
B005BZQVJ8|4|Loved the jabs at religion. Have loved Simon Pegg for years -- \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", \\"Hot Fuzz\\" and more -- and look forward to his new \\"World's End\\".
B00H8AX7R8|5|As a singer (mostly background) I really loved this film. It is about time these women were broght into the spotlight. They are nothing short of inspiring.

B000XA5K48|5|It's like Michael Davis took every unique scene from every action flick ever made and crammed them into one movie. It's like Quentin Tarantino with Tourette's. It's like an exhaustive list of gunfight scenarios; gunfighting while: on a bus, in a pool, sky diving, making love... ad infinitum. Gun play with loads of epic bonus cheese. Be sure to move the rug out from in front of your entertainment center because 100% pure, grade-A American cheddar will ooze out of your speakers and screen. Don't let it go to waste. Make nachos or something. There is a scene involving Paul Giamatti, a merry-go-round, a baby, Clive Owen, and some guns (Yes, guns! Imagine that!) It was so epic at that moment that I almost died... laughing, that is. If you don't love this movie, then you are probably a cat person that hates Ninja Turtles.
B00ADIT8U2|5|Interesting and unique story.  Hint system tells you where items are.
B0017SWPXY|5|When I first read this book, a few years ago, I was struck by the truths set out from the racers perspective; being at one with the track, driving always for the next section, preparing well ahead for your moves and passes. Having been involved in racing for some years that was very appealing. That the narrator is a dog gave me even more love for the book. But I think what gives me the most hope and life lessons are the finely interwoven bits of reincarnation, Buddhist thought and the joy and hope for our evolution as sentient beings. Thank you, Mr. Stein, for one of the very few books I re-read and highlight when I need a encouraging reminder that to live with intention and love as my  saving grace;  the important stuff;  Love, honor, and hope.

0156030470|5|A deceptively simple novel that explores the meaning of life.  Written in a stream-of-consciousness poetic style, this is a book that should be read slowly, not at the pace of a traditional novel, or you will miss the slow-motion explosions of beautiful insights lurking about when least expected.  Her characters move like spirits in the material world.  And as the reader - the voyeur transported to this other dimension - you hear and feel them brush past you like ghosts - who will sometimes pass right through your heart.  Unequivocally, this is my favorite novel.
0920668372|5|This book has always been a favorite childrens story.  It is beautifully written and since it has the repetition of the chorus it becomes easy for children to learn the story. A 4-year-old child I bought this for memorized the entire story in a couple weeks and constantly begs her mom to read it again and again.  Buy this book and you will not regret it.  I am happy I can now share this memory with my daughter and hopefully she will develop a strong love for it and share it with her children 20+ years from now.

When in the fight for it all mode, nothing can be better than to know these guys have your back.<br />To all of you, Thank You for Your Service.

B00EB6ENXO|5|I rated this movie 5 stars because of its visual effects. There are so many things about this movie that are perfect. 1 of those perfections is the believable acting of R. Downing jr. I'm a avid Marvel comics fan and he played the part of Iron Man perfectly. LOVE IT! I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes Marvel Comics!
B007SNMYNS|4|The author spends the major portion of the book convincing you how bad today's modified wheat is for us.  I believe this is an important message however it could have been covered in 2 short chapters.  I kept waiting to read about how to eliminate it from our diet.  That came in Part Three at the very end of the book and was a slim portion.  It left me wanting much more information on how and what to eat because he states gluten free products are off limits as well.  I am now looking for a good cookbook and have heard the author is coming out with one soon.<br />I would recommend this book to those who want to learn more about what's been done to the wheat in our food products and what the health consequences are.
1582701709|2|Offers some decent principles about the \\"rights and wrongs\\" of life ... and puts a pop culture spin on the old adage that you are in control of your own destiny.     A little too over the top for me to get more than 3/4 of the way through the book.

B004SIP71M|4|While the book may be better than the movie, the book didn't star Meryl Streep. \\"Doubt\\" is a sharp, riveting performance piece that showcases the talents of its four main players: Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. The storyline is simply a lightning rod that harnesses the electric bravura of these stars, and if, perhaps, someday the plot stales this film will lose none of its potency thanks to its actors.<br /><br />It's a tremendous film that builds to a crisp, crackling finale between Sister Aloysius, played by the redoubtable Streep, and Father Flynn, played by Hoffman. Only the first twenty minutes sputter and kick and never achieve the power of the original play. Those familiar with Shanley's script will remember its tight unity of place, time, and action as the story revolves around a series of claustrophobic exchanges between four characters; the writing is sparse, expert, clean. In order to \\"open up\\" the script for the film version, Shanley spreads out the first scene between Sister Aloysius and Sister James into multiple encounters while filling in the gaps with new characters and narrative penumbra. As a result, the start is loose and a tad blunted in comparison to the glorious rest of the film. The moment Sister Aloysius and Sister James enter the eighth grade classroom and squabble over ballpoint pens does the film recover its focus.<br /><br />True, the extra characters and scenes satisfy the \\"movie-going experience\\" and give the audience glimpses into the world of the story. Roger Deakins, celebrated cinematographer, provides ample chiaroscuro to actors' faces and allows each room to glow with a soft focus. There's even ancillary material in the movie that humanizes Sister Aloysius--her concern for aging Sister Veronica helps viewers sympathize with her character more than in the stage play. Nevertheless, the added material lacks the acuteness of its source and may even reveal Shanley's hesitancy toward it.<br /><br />Nowadays, to say Streep gives a powerful performance is akin to saying fire is hot; it's common knowledge that she is one of our finest actresses. In \\"Doubt,\\" I believe she gives one of her most memorable performances. Regardless of who ended up with the Academy Award in 2009, this was Streep's year, and Sister Aloysius was the reason. Davis is equally brilliant; she needed only twelve minutes of screen time to steal the entire show. As Mrs. Miller, mother of the boy thought to have been seduced by Father Flynn, Davis is like a controlled explosion: contained, for the most part, on the surface but betrays her outer calm with every glance and nervous gesture. Watch her when she tells Sister Aloysius, \\"Do I ask the man why he's good to my son?\\" Ebert said it best when he described the scene between Streep and Davis as a matching of equals.<br /><br />Overall, a great film the benefits from Streep's unparalleled and uncompromising dedication to the role. Her voice, her expressions, her movements are all Sister Aloysius--the actress has given us a singular and seminal character. Thanks to this, along with Davis and Deakins, this may have been the most deserving film of 2009.

B001RIY49C|5|Awesome, this sits on the shelf next to my &#34;alien&#34; head and my planet of the apes &#34;ape&#34; head. A Great film evoking wonderfull popcorny memories, an effects laden treat which works beautifully alongside its more horror driven b-movie predecessor. Arnies finest hour, and a 6 disc box set worthy of a film which entertained me during my childhood...Hasta la vista, baby!
B00L23SE52|5|Very funny and, for anyone who has ever done lego or has children that do lego, there were many little details to note in each scene. I had thought it would be a bit silly but it was a fun and clever movie that actually had a moral story to it that did not become clear until the surprise ending. I'm a 50 year old woman and I loved it. The whole family and some friends really enjoyed it too.
B00EY7MFKS|5|I will admit, this show started out not really knowing what it wanted to be. The characters were kind of forgettable and really not very sympathetic. However, since it's return from winter hiatus, Agents of SHIELD has really found its footing and pulled together. The arc of the season is now clear, I am invested in the characters and look forward to seeing what is going to happen each week.<br /><br />Having just seen Captain America: The Winter Soldier last night and knowing how the show will be affected by the events of the movie, I can't wait to see the rest of the season.

6305308659|3|Lighthearted, amusing comedy which becomes unnecessarily menacing at the end when evil characters start becoming racist; because race issue is resolved so quickly and without much thought, these racist overtones are  somewhat disturbing.  Art direction, however, is excellent.  Sound on the  DVD is o.k.  Great Fiona Apple video directed by P.T. Anderson is included  in the Extra Features.  Another very good New Line disc in another very  crappy WB's case.
0143038419|2|I had waited to read this book, and had been looking forward to it.  When I got it for a trip home to read on the plane, it turned out to be a big disappointment.  Eventually when I got stuck in one airport for five hours, with nothing to read but this book, I ended up buying a new book as I could not read one more page of it.  The first thing that bothered me about the story was the horrible decisions she made.  I had no connection to the protagonist.  She was not a woman I respected.  Plus her perspective was very indulgent of her behavior and almost bragging, while pretending to be self aware.  This woman just seems to meet gorgeous intelligent men who all want to date her wherever she went.  Which seemed unrealistic for many reasons.  The worst part (I had skipped around hoping to find a part I could tolerate) was the last section on finding the love of her life.  Basically we get to hear about their constant wonderful lovemaking ad nauseam.  It seemed an immature focus of a book written by a woman no longer in her twenties.  Overall I did not find it enlightening or inspiring, just embarrassing.

B002HML6ZM|5|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans. Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable, although sometimes he seems too determinedly juvenile. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still verymuch in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. He's a brilliant anti-villain, with tragic and bittersweet dimensions to his character.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision..

We in the US consume roughly 10 times more animal protein than the regions of China that eat a plant based diet.<br /><br />There are 500,000 bypass operations performed in the US every year. The China study data supports the assertion that almost all of the atherosclerosis disease in the US can be prevented by a change from an animal based diet to plant based diet.<br /><br />Colin Campbell states in the film Forks over Knives that 70 to 80% of US medical costs can be eliminated by a change from an animal based diet to plant based diet.<br /><br />The film Forks over Knifes documents the stories of hundreds of people who have solved their health problems by changing from an animal based to plant based diet.<br />Based on the data presented in Campbell's book and the film Forks over Knives I changed from an animal based diet to plant based diet, eliminating dairy, cheese, chicken, fish, and steak from my diet. After the change my high blood pressure problems were resolved and I no longer had problems with arthritis. I sleep better and feel great.<br /><br />I unhesitatingly recommend reading the China Study and watching the film Forks over Knifes to my friends and love ones.
0312370849|1|This rating is not for the book (which I have yet to read) it is for the condition of the book. It was supposed to be used-like new but when it arrived the cover was pretty bashed up and there is writing inside and a number of passages are marked with highlighter. I have ordered used-like new books from amazon before and the condition of this book certainly does not compare.

B00715SUI6|4|I know some people don't really care for movies such as these but I enjoyed it. It shows of what happened to the two sisters when they were younger and has an interesting story to it. I would say that you could watch this one before the other two as it is more of a prequel in a sense. I would recommend this to anybody who has seen the first two or to anybody has an interest in the genre.
B00005N7Z1|5|robocop is one of those films that is somewhat of a genre unto itself...somehow the extremity of the violence lends it a horror vein...the technology becomes science fiction...the sets somehow become almost gothic...alienated...the theme is overtly tragic...the humor is at times ridiculous almost slapstick... at others pointedly black...i love this film...it resonates as much today as it did in it's first screening...it is at once thrilling and unsettling...there is little luxury or dependance on extensive special effects here instead the director relies on the narrative...on the tragedy and the quest for understanding the unimaginable in one man...on the sense of loss and the need for balance...there is much evil in this film much bloodshed and excess but to marginalize robocop for these undercurrents would be unjust...this is a tragedy and without the dark we would never comprehend the light...this film exemplifies this duality perfectly...watch it and you will see...
0525945636|2|I came to this book excited about the amnesia aspect (I study memory professionally), but was disappointed. I found this book to be too predictable, not in its plot details but in the overall design. Good guy finds just what he needs just when he needs it, is befriended by all the right people, discovers the truth just in the nick of time, etc. More disturbing was the way Follett played fast and loose with facts. There is not now, and certainly was not then, a reliable way to induce total autobiographical amnesia in one treatment over a few hours. Want something more clear-cut? Several times he refers to people &quot;xeroxing&quot; things, but Xerox (then called Haloid Xerox) introduced the first plain-paper, dry-ink xerographic copier in 1959 -- but this book is set in 1958. Surely Follett is old enough to remember mimeographing things all the way into the 60s and 70s, and if he doesn't an editor should have. This shows a disregard for accuracy and, by extension, a lack of respect for the reader, which definitely destroys my respect for the book.

0812982193|5|This is one of the best diet/health/fitness books that I have ever read.  As the title suggests, the author examines salt sugar and fat as they relate to our modern diet.<br /><br />Michael Moss presents a terrifying look at the food industry and presents a horrible picture of corporate greed gone amok without preaching or moralizing.  He goes beyond science (although there is plenty) to look at how the major food corporations actually altered the social fabric of America in order to increase their profits.<br /><br />One of Moss's common themes is the utter ineffectuality of government agencies designed to protect the public.  He demonstrates conclusively that when a regulatory agency has a budget of millions of dollars it is utterly steamrolled by the billions the major corporations spend on lobbying and advertising.  Thus, even bald-faced corporate lies and manipulation get sold to the public as facts.<br /><br />At the same time these corporations spend billions engineering their products to make them more addictive.  In fact there are some scary parallels with drug addiction - much of the research involves high-tech methods such as fMRIs of people eating snack foods to figure out how best to satisfy the pleasure centers.  Other research involves the &#34;Bliss Point&#34; or point of maximum satisfaction/craving for a food.<br /><br />At times I found the book difficult to read, because it made me realize just how callous and evil these greedy men were.  They knew they were setting out to destroy people's health, but simply did not care.  There's a pretty constant theme of food company execs and food scientists, later in their lives, suddenly developing a conscience, after they had already feathered their own nest with money born of human suffering.<br /><br />This book changed my perspective on obesity.  Obesity isn't due to 'laziness' or 'genetics' - it is pretty much due to an entire unscrupulous industry deliberately setting out to addict people to borderline-poisonous processed food products.  The brainwashing starts at a very young age and never stops.  Please read this book, and make your children read it!
184708432X|4|Written as if by a 19th century Author.  Certainly not Olde English but it may take a high school level reader a bit to get the groove.  The story line is unique to me and involves numerous characters.  I tended to forget who was who at first but there is a convenient list at the beginning with a less than satisfying undetailed map of the local environs.  I didn't appreciate the map because too many locations mentioned in the text were not on the map a very minor annoyance to me.  I recommend this book.
B00IHMEBDU|5|Absolutely amazing! Suspenseful and intriguing the whole time! Incredible story and detailed imagery keep you up reading when you know you should sleep!

B0001ZMWQO|1|Franz Ferdinand represents what is truely wrong with the music industry...FF trys to coax their listeners into all the &quot;new-old&quot; fad bands out there...&quot;Oh you like the Strokes..well here is such-and-such. What? Not in the mood for that, well how about some Interpolish flavor?&quot; Really, how about showing some creativity? That's what it use to be about anyways. UKish bands before FF did and still do (see Blur's &quot;Think Tank&quot;), but not these guys. It makes you wonder does the O.C. just exist to sponsor their own breed of carbon copy bands of curent hits (Jet, etc.)? The bands they try to emulate may not be head and shoulders creative musical geniuses, but they do their craft well. Franz Ferdinand does not. Yawn.

B00005JKDR|5|\\"Monsters Inc\\" gets my nod as my favorite of the trainload of CGI animated features that Pixar has brought forth during this great time for animated movies versus the awful period for music. \\"Toy Story\\" paved the way for these movies but I never thought it would happen but \\"Monster's Inc\\" does the unthinkable, it actually surpasses \\"Toy Story\\" not only in the excellent animation but also of groundbreaking graphics (Sully's Fur) and of a really, REALLY original story idea. I guess it's safe to say that this movie made me conquer my fear of going into the closets at night and if there are monsters, I'm no longer afraid of them. Just for a little humor. I haven't laughed so hard the way I did with seeing \\"Monster's Inc\\" and it's hard not to see why. That's why I love Pixar's movies. They aim for all ages from young children to elderly audiences and \\"Monsters Inc\\" is the best of them all alongside \\"Finding Nemo\\". The whole story plot idea is unbelievably original and unsurpassed by many movies since this one.<br />It all begins with a typical night with a monster who aims to scare a sleeping child by creeping out of the closet. The whole thing goes awry and turns out to be a simulation and we discover the reasons why monsters actually come out of closets and scare the children of the human world. The Monsters scare the children because they need to collect the children's screams to a utility power plant where the screams generate electricity for their city of Monstropolis. However the city of Monstropolis is facing a looming power shortage because the children of the human world are becoming harder and harder to scare and thus brownouts are becoming more and more commonplace, threatening the very well being of the monster world. The problems don't stop there. While the top scarer of the monster crew James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) continues his winning streak as the number one scarer, a nemesis co-worker named Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is also causing some headaches. The CEO of the company Henry J. Waternoose is also ready to use any means to keep his company from collapsing from the power crisis gripping Monstropolis.<br />The main storyline though is of a much more chaotic incident. According to Waternoose's warnings, the humans possibly carry germs that may be deadly for monsters to become infected with and the crews take drastic measures to avoid getting touched by the humans that they try to scare. One night, as Sullivan is going to turn in his assistant Mike Wazowski's paperwork and finds a door that is activated. He opens it and unaware of it, a toddler escapes through the door and right into the monster factory. Unable to get her back into her right bedroom, Sullivan attempts to disguise her but fails and as utter pandemonium follows, and vast numbers of C.D.A. (Child Detection Agency) decontamination units scouring the city for the missing child, Sullivan along with his longtime friend Mike Wazowski are on a long quest to get Boo home without being caught by the C.D.A. Sully and Mike however are unaware that they have several enemies that are working within their own ranks which make their mission to return Boo home more complicated and more dangerous.<br /> The computer generated animation effects are absolutely breathtaking in just aobut every way you look at it. The animation effects of Sullivan's turquoise blue fur is so well done that it looks almost like actual live footage of a costume. Even the movements look incredibly lifelike and the details in the movie are just incredible! This movie is just about perfect in so many ways. If there is any quibble I have aobut this movie, it's that it's only 90 minutes long. Perhaps I'm spoiled at the movie lengths after seeing the Lord of The Rings movies but I think \\"Monsters Inc\\" should've been at least two hours long for more fun but that's just my opinion.<br /> The actors selected for the voices perfectly match the personalities of the characters they provided the voice work for. The late James Coburn perfectly fitted the elderly role of the longtime elder Henry J. Waternoose, CEO of the Monsters Incorporated Company which his family has owned for three generations and it's really sad that Coburn moved on so soon after such a great movie. My favorite of all is of John Goodman who provides the stadium sized voice of the great James P. Sullivan, the top scarer of the Monsters Inc. workforce. He sounds so incredibly funny when he screams especially during when he discovers Boo has escaped into the factory. Billy Crystal is incredibly awesome playing Sullivan's constantly agitated assistant and lifelong friend Mike Wazowski and his voice is perfectly especially when Wazowski is uptight about things. Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, they're all great.<br /> While younger viewers will certainly have a great time with the charm factor of this movie, older audiences will likely get a truly good message of about how even fearsome-looking creatures or human beings can in reality turn out being very gentle and caring beings who wouldn't even hurt a fly. And while I don't believe that monsters necessarily exist in most places, this movie also explains the reasons why monsters do this, scaring the daylights out of the sleeping children, they need their screams to power their cities but the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them.<br /> Enough said, go and buy this DVD as soon as you can. This is one of the greatest animated movies that has ever been made and the crew behind it's conception deserve the utmost praise for it's creation.voice work for.

031606792X|1|Spoiler Alert - Don't Read This If You Don't Want Spoilers      I am a die hard Twilight fan, the books were enjoyable escapism into the world of vampires and the humans who love them in Breaking Dawn we see that world turned upside down. I was okay with everything until Book 2, and not because I don't like Jacob, I like Jacob, especially when he is getting over Bella. But in this book, his story was the only thing worth reading about. Bella and Edward are so boring and unlike themselves it was painful to continue to read the book after Book 1.    Let's begin, Bella, our iconic hero who is baffled she is 18 and getting married suddenly is pregnant and guess what is thrilled. Rosalie, our blonde bombshell who hates Bella is there by her side, and if Bella dies wouldn't care in previous books and definitely in this one, basically gets to raise the kid. Hey wait, she pretty much does that anyway. Bella is in full-on martyrdom now. Was Bella ever a martyr, she was like us, normal, in every respect. She just happened to fall in love with Edward.    Edward is not our Edward anymore. No more are there loving touches and words, we get a wooden character with no attachment to his demon-spawn. In this matter I don't blame him, she was killing our Bella.     Renesme or Nessie. What a pointless plot device, how about we focus on Bella as a vampire, or Bella enjoying sex, Edward seeing he didn't kill her and maybe college? Nope, baby time it is.     Jacob was redeemable until imprinting on Nessie. Why, couldn't he normally fall in love, over time with Leah? It seemed that's where the plot was going, but no yet again, a pointless plot that leads no where.    Where were the Cullens? Dr Cullen, knowing Bella could literally pop at any moment, goes to get blood? Esme frets but says nothing, Alice and Jasper are gone, Emmett says sex jokes. Where is our beloved family?    Charlie is cool with babies, vampires and wearwolves? Right, great Police officer there.    I'm sorry I loved thebooks but this was inexcusable. I've read better, more involving fan fiction by 13 year olds.     Bella becomes a Mary Sue, and I hated her for it. Edward isn't our knight in shinning, sometimes coming to our window in dented armor, he's just boring, Jacob almost redeemed himself if he had actually moved on with someone, I'd have liked it to be Leah. but nope he's in Bella life for all time. The Cullens are useless and Nessie, all I can say is that I wanted her dead before she was born.
B00007KWHN|5|I bought this last week in Singapore, knowing that I had owned previous atlantic remasters (and cassette too). I knew I won't be dissapointed. The sonic enhancement of this Rhino remaster truly brings the song out. Yours Is No Disgrace sounds like a song recorded within the last 5 years. It was so fresh! Bruford play of drums is very noticeable. Howe's guitar in the background can be quickly recognized - compared to previous remasters version. Overall - recommended for all YES fans and completist!<br />My only complaint is that we need Rhino not to confuse the fans. For example, I've bought DVD-Audio Fragile with America as extra song. As I've got the DVD version, iniatially I didn't want to buy the CD-remaster version, but now Rhino package it with &quot;early rough mix&quot; of roundabout (whatever the hell that is). It's clever - because some true completist (even among the completist) will be forced to buy the CD version when they already own the Atlantic version, the DVD-Audio - and in my case, the cassette version (ok, quality suffers).

1433502410|4|There is a lot to like about the ESV Study Bible. It brings a wealth of mostly sound and up-to-date evangelical scholarship together, often with a distinct conservative and Reformed flavor. Needless to say, this Bible is rather bulky and the font of the study notes is quite small; such is the price of combining a mass of information in one volume.     There is one thing I don't like about this Bible, and it is costing it a star. All the contributors who have written articles or study notes are male. With 95 such contributors, this has to be deliberate. The promotion material states: \\"The contributors come from 9 countries, representing nearly 20 denominations and more than 50 seminaries, colleges, and universities\\" - but only one gender. I have only found two women listed among those who have worked on this study Bible (assuming I have correctly assessed gender in all cases), and they deserve to be mentioned by name: Sherah Grose, \\"Assistant to the Project Director\\" (and therefore not a threat to male supremacy, I suppose) and Monica Gee, \\"Bible Production Coordinator\\", whatever that means.    The study notes to controversial passages like 1 Corinthians 14 and 1 Timothy 2 indicate this Bible takes a clear anti-Egalitarian position. On numerous debatable issues such as a late or early date for the exodus, the meaning of the millennium in Revelation 20, and the overall approach to the book of Revelation, this Bible presents an overview of the main evangelical positions. This is what I expect of a good commentary or study Bible; it should do justice to the spectrum of evangelical opinion. It is very unfortunate that the ESV Study Bible does not do this when it comes to the issue of women in the church.    There can be no doubt: this is a male study Bible.
B00SI7GCJK|5|This is just a great film. It's really too bad that some viewers can't appreciate this. Maybe it would be best to stay away from movies like this and stick with the newest iteration of &#34;the avengers&#34;.

0142403873|4|One of my friends recommended this book after she read one of my four-year-old son's stories.  She thought he might like it and be able to relate to the mouse.  She was very right.  My son scares away scary monkeys and other terrifying creatures in his stories.  He certainly can relate to this mouse.<br /><br />I read that Julia Donaldson originally planned for the gruffalo to be a tiger, but had to create a gruffalo to fit her rhyming scheme.  I am so glad that she did.  The mystery of the gruffalo builds the suspense of this tale.  This book pays homage to Sendak's \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\", but still stands easily on its own.  The rhyme and meter are well done and the conclusion is quite satisfying.<br /><br />The illustrations by Axel Scheffler also pay homage to Sendak, but they, again, stand very well on their own.  All the expressions and emotions of the mouse are conveyed by the eyes, tail and arms -- everything else remains almost static.  It is a very effective technique. The gruffalo is scary, but not too scary; he does look as if he might be tricked by a clever mouse.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad my friend recommended this book.  It makes a delightful addition to my son's library.
B009JZWO3I|3|For entertainment value, I do enjoy the show, but they sure sleep with a lot with coworkers . No HR rules here! And this is a law office. I guess it's needed for the shock value  but it almost needs a warning... ' don't try this at your office' I find it interesting that with all these different people, the tend to use the same speech pattern.. Blunt, straight forward like scripted.. When asked a question they say 'I am' or yes it is or something I can't quite explain but the use the same manor of speech. I really like Klinda person. She and Carry A are my faves. I least like Peter and don't feel much if any chemestery between him and Alisha. She should dump him and take up with Will but that's just my take. Oh and Ely is a basket of fun too. Give us more Ely. I liked the Ely / Jordan story line. More of that. The clients they come up with ate fun and different. Love Elsbeth Tasiaonie! Keep her! Thank you for making interesting entertainment.
B00KMX5V8G|5|I love this game also.  It is sooooooooooo much fun.
B00687Q0VC|2|I loved the first two episodes...they were well made, the actors were so believable that I could pick them out as being who they portrayed before they were introduced into the show.  I found the third and fourth episodes boring, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh very well made and interesting...but they slanted or eliminated  a great deal of the  wrong Adams did during his time in office and pushed the blame off on the Vice President.  This show is made from John Adams' point of view, so parts of it are extremely biased.  The Adams-Jefferson race was the ugliest in American history.  Both the parties attacked each other with so much propaganda that both the candidates are still blackened by it to this day....especially Jefferson.  The producers did a very good job of saving Adams' character from the propaganda.  But the negative claims about Jefferson are actually upheld during the movie. In truth, these claims are unproven so should not be shown as fact.  I was very excited to see the first episodes and if these were fictional characters made into a fictional piece I would love it.  But they aren't. They were great men and women, in my opinion who should never be tainted by lies of yesterday.  If you do watch this show don't take it as fact.
B008BQLH52|1|This show had an interesting start, however, it lacks depth.  It's basically the same loop over and over again with no intelligent details or consistency to the characters.  The stories are sloppy and things are done just for the sake of creating drama.  If you're looking for a show that you can connect to as an intelligent adult, look elsewhere.  If you like to get high or drunk and then watch TV, then this one will do fine...but I'm sure you'd be okay watching The Home Shopping Network and have a better time.
B002RSDW80|5|This movie is so cute! Meryl Streep does a fantastic job of portraying Julia Child. It makes you want to learn to cook like Julia. I'm not going to lie... I bought \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking: Volume I\\" immediately after watching this. It's really a good movie, I recommend it.
B00BEZTMFY|5|The start of this movie is hilarious.  It's a wonderful adventure, full of frights & fights & magic.  Peter Jackson is a genius.  To those &#34;purists&#34; who say he did not really follow the book, tough noogies.  This movie may not have won an Academy Award but so what.  Most of my favorite movies didn't but I still love them.<br /><br />This is right on par with TLOTR.  Wonderful CG's, adventure, music & songs.

B004LWZW4C|3|Hey people, i dint read the reviews here at Amazon and didn't know about the problems with this disc in some blu-ray players before making this purchase, so i received mine this week (thanks to Black Friday) and put it on my PS3 player, every movie and game i have works fine except this disc, the disc looks brand new so it seems that the problem is a compatibility issue.  Here is how you make it work (for PS3 of course):  1. Shut down your Internet connection.  2. Go to BD Data in the Video section of your PS3 menu and look for the folder that the X-MEN movie copied, and delete it!  3. Re-start your PS3 and then put the movie on.  Right now i am watching the movie with no problems but I still thinks that it is a compatibility issue and an update form Sony should correct that in the near future. I hope it works for all of you!  Still remember that you cant see this movie every time you insert the disc with your Internet connection active so if this issue isn't solved we should get a replacement in case Fox decide to correct this issue with new copies of the movie.  So 3 stars because this problem I will not change this to 5 stars until it isn't resolved.  Enjoy!

Pros: Funny, Sexy, Enjoyable Cast, Watchable    Cons: Special Effects Seem A Bit Fake.    Overall: *** stars
1451627289|5|I thoroughly enjoyed Stephen King's latest novel, \\"11/22/63\\", and because I have posted critical reviews of some of his previous works as being in desperate need of an editor, I thought it only fair to post of positive review of this well executed thriller.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for a good time-travel story and will add this one to my list of the best in the genre. There is something about the creativity, the science, the challenge to the reader's sense of logic, the paradoxes and the sheer romance of time-travel that really hooks me as a reader when it's done right.  And King did it right; I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />But it wasn't just the plot that captivated me; I cared about the characters, especially when George/Jake got to Jodie, Texas. My mind kept racing ahead to possible outcomes - but it's futile to try to out-guess Stephen King when it comes to suspense! This is a writer who is brave enough to have killed off major characters in several of his novels - so you never know what twist is lurking on the next page.<br />So thank you, Mr. King! You are certainly not done yet!<br /><br />(P.S. King is also a master of the novella. I highly recommend his collection of four novellas in, \\"Full Dark, No Stars\\", but be warned; it's RAW. Not for kids or sensitive readers.)
B00AHTYGRW|5|This is one outstanding movie.  It is like &#34;Apollo 13&#34; in that even though you know how it will end it still holds you in suspense.  Allan Arkin and John Goodman are fantastic, and I have to give props to Ben Affleck.  This is a &#34;must-own&#34; movie.

B00JAOK4N0|5|Great music.  Classic Santana mixed with great Hispanic artists. A variety of pop, Cuban, Mexican, and Central American music you would enjoy even though some of these artists I had never heard of.  Now I would buy their music also.
B000002BFL|5|Don't get me wrong, I am primarily a maniacal fan of Bruce's rock 'n' roll masterpieces and his stupendous live shows, but his acoustic work shows equally important facets of his genius as a songwriter/musician/poet.   These &quot;Tom Joad&quot; recordings have the haunting quality of  Appalachian folk songs with the lyric depth of the poems of Federico Garcia  Lorca or Dylan Thomas. I honestly can't think of another musical artist  that has captured the heartbreak, complexity and hope of the American  experience in the way that Springsteen has.  &quot;Galveston Bay&quot;  talks with quiet irony of way in which our nation of immigrants tends  tragically to discriminate against each latest wave newcomers.  And yet, by  the end of the song, the antagonists finally relent and allow new blood to  reinvigorate and replenish the American dream. &quot;Across the  Border&quot; captures the mix of hope and illusion that draws so many to  &quot;El Norte.&quot;  &quot;Youngstown&quot; speaks achingly of the  betrayal of the American working man and woman. &quot;Dry Lightening&quot;  paints a word picture of the itchy, discomforting freedom promised by true  love and the unending horizons of western plains. I could go on and on. I  never tire of this album.  It still has the ability to change my life just  a tiny bit for the better each time I hear it. If you don't love &quot;Tom  Joad&quot; on first bounce, play it again and let its power seep into your  soul.  You'll never be sorry.
B0040I09RM|5|It was one of the best tv series out there.
B005RUV0NY|5|Have been buying the season sets of these for my family to watch together. We are hooked. Love them and will continue to buy the season sets. Well worth the price.
B00973902K|5|Awesome song...
B00FPH6AXE|2|Um. I was not impressed. I couldn't get passed the bad accent. The special effects could of been a little better.
B00177YA1K|4|The original &#34;Men in Black&#34; story is fairly plausible science fiction with enough goofiness that 10-year old kids love it.  It's very original.  I can't recommend the sequels, which moved towards the goofier side, as they usually do.  Men in Black is no &#34;Matrix,&#34; &#34;Avatar,&#34; or &#34;War of the Worlds,&#34; but the aliens created with special effects are darling and the &#34;bug&#34; is as close to an alien as any human actor can manage (better than any Star Trek Equivalent; that's for sure).  He's a real charmer, who delivers flawless lines, like the one from his conversation with an exterminator in which the exterminator looks at a dozen cockroaches and asks, &#34;Don't you want me to kill them all?&#34;  -whereupon the alien says, &#34;Oh, In the worst way.&#34;  -except that he's talking about humans.  The last thirty seconds of the movie is the best part.  It really stretches your imagination as only the best science fiction can.
0307352145|1|She uses less-than-interesting word choice, messy in-text citation and the obnoxious &#34;something something which we will learn about later&#34; ever so prevalent in sloppy, pieced together essays written by unfocused teens.  I was promised a new and interesting insight into introvert lifestyle but it seems I've only been provided with common sense on paper, coupled with ambiguous stories that are only relevant when MADE relevant.  If you're as creative and intelligent as the author claims introverts to be, you wouldn't need some petty self-help book to tell you that.
B0064X7FVE|5|simple download and easy to use.  just like logging on to the weather channel only much faster.  works well on my kindle fire hd
B00KX45CJW|5|Excellent!
B00992CF6W|5|Minecraft is the best game I know. Every body should get this game.  I play it every day it is so awesome.
B00985E3UG|5|I was worried this would be a Michael Moore-style manifesto because of the subtitle, but I bought it anyway and I'm glad I did! Michael Moss writes with the concern for truth of a true journalist, but the prose isn't dry. I was so interested to learn about something as seemingly mundane as salt production, much to my surprise. Moss keeps judgment out of his book, with the exception of the epilogue, he's not interested in reprimanding the food giants, the government, or the consumer. And actually, I should add that while biased, I found the epilogue really touching. Highly recommend!
B004MC8CA2|5|I am reading God's word one day at a time. I'll be all the way through it in one year. I selected the version that works for me. I can also look up any other verses that I want which is great for my Bible study time.
B0097GVJWQ|4|really liked this game. nice quality to it. had no problem with it on my kindle fire.  played for hours. worth the price. I have paid more for other games and enjoyed them less. good job on this one.
B00XWUOG64|5|Outstanding!  Shows what writers can do when they put their minds to it.  Excellent cast and acting all around!
0345529057|1|The third book in this set is missing about forty pages starting at 496. Terrible. The books were in great condition but the missing pages are inexcusable.
B004GYY714|4|This app is very easy to use.  Has worked well to find stations i like in other cities i've lived in.  Highly reommend it.  yay
B006LSZECO|5|Awesome book! Cant put the book down!! So rcciting and interesting!
B000092ZYX|5|When I first heard of Radiohead, a friend at camp told me they were good so I went out and bought this as my first Radiohead CD. I bought it along with some other CD's which I already knew I would like so after one listen, it went back on the shelf barely listened to. I hated Thom Yorke's whiny voice and the strange elctronica on a few of the tracks. A little while ago I decided to listen to it again. After a few listens it started to grow on me and, all of a sudden, it was my favorite album. For my birthday, I bought OK Computer which is judged many here as a better album. I liked it but I think this follows as a close second. I like almost every song except for We Suck Young Blood
B004QXJZXA|5|Great Movie
B00DSY8D36|4|Good
B00F522C7C|5|This was a birthday gift for our grandson's 3rd birthday. He is head over heels in love with this movie. It couldn't be more entertaining for him and a delight for us to watch with him. Terrific animation, appropriate dialog and just the right playing time.
B003HLM2QO|2|Sure we all want to love the new studio album from the Prince of Darkness, but you just can't fool yourself into believing that this is a good album. The riffs are generic, the solos are short and bland, the vocals are in very limited range, and the whole album is just mediocre. I'm not saying it's a total loss, Ozzy doesn't really make any 'bad' albums, but I would definitely put this at the bottom of the list.<br />  I didn't mind Ozzy replacing Zakk, despite being the Zakk fan I am, but I thought Ozzy could use some fresh blood on guitar. There's no doubt Gus G is a talented guitarist, but there's something lacking I can't quite put my finger on. It is said that Gus didn't write any of the songs on Scream so hopefully on the next album, he will be able to take some creative freedom and give us something unique, because this album just sounds like a much lesser Black Rain album. We love Ozzy, but this album is at the bottom of the barrel :-/
B00EMXBDMA|4|Good read! Interesting, thought provoking! Seriously enjoyed mark's smart-ass survival!  Maybe could have condensed the really scientific calculations.  Pic recommend it.
B008Z9YGEE|5|Excellent.  Keeps u at the edge of ur seat. Cant wait for the next one to come out.
B00BB8SKPW|4|Really great movie. Washington gives a wonderful performance, as usual. I also think it's noteworthy that this is a very good cinematic representation of the alcoholic mindset. Check it out!
B00BAXFJ5M|4|Exciting story, well-developed characters and fast action make this a page-turner. I would give it a thumbs up as a book choice.
0670022411|5|I won't summarize the plot as it has been adequately done already but I found this to be a great, intellectually stimulating book.  Although some commented on historical inaccuracies, review the author's educational background and day job and re-evaluate.  Yes, there were many parallels with Twilight, however I appreciated the adult approach and sophisticated plot.  Can't wait for #2!!
B004YF6MHW|3|Good app, but it needs to be updated to the latest version that's available on GP store
B00DR0PDNE|5|Works as advertised.  I had a little trouble getting it working at first, but it turned out to be a config issue on my part when adding it to my router.  I am impressed with the fact that there has not yet been a buffering wheel or whatever they use to indicate buffering.
B002NPUCP8|5|I have followed Orianthi's artistry for several years: long before Carrie Underwood, long before Michael Jackson. I purchased her first CD Violet Journey and was simply amazed at the talent of her guitar playing. I watched each and every video on the internet. I eagerly awaited this new CD: and it was worth the wait and then some. The CD is very well produced and the songs flow one into the other. Intelligent songwriting and incredible guitar work. Simply put, Orianthi is phenomenal! I believe she is the next superstar in the guitar world bar none. Do yourself a favor: Believe it and Buy It!
B0017SWPXY|3|Interesting point of view.  Unexpected turn of events.  A pretty good story.  Dog lover's would enjoy this story.  I hoped for a little more.
B00ARHAAZ6|2|Doesn't live up to his better works.  Often hokey and unsophisticated -- somewhat disappointed but not terrible.  Still a BS fan.
B00BMT9SQA|2|ehhh~~<br /><br />c'mon barbra streisand, c'mon..<br />even rogen admitted this was a bad idea..
6305066345|4|I loved the movie overall but felt that the scences with denzel and the prostitute were completly unneccesary and brought down the movie.
B00KWVZ750|5|Angry birds epic is epic! It's really fun. Thanks Rovio!!! I cannot wait for the next angry bird release! Signed, your BIGGEST fan!!!
B00IX9UTLU|5|Worth the money for sure!! I enjoyed all three books and never once got bored. Characters are well put together.
B00HDMMISA|4|Not as good as some of her other books but definitely entertaining and a quick read
6305841861|1|Movie opens with a guy who finds some tape recorder type thing. You think this is going to be good. Kinda creepy. Not long after he finds this tape recorder and listens to this tape about evil spirits - soon some evil force comes along and goes through the woods and starts to possess people... so I think.<br /><br />Lame from the get go. Right after he finds this tape it goes downhill. Horribly cheesy special effects, very unscary and not at all funny. Completely devoid of any redeeming value.<br /><br />I heard this was a \\" re-make\\", why remake something this crappy to begin with? The whole movie was bad and the end was even more stupid. The special effects were bad, the demons at the end were not scary or funny. Just plain lame. - Bad actors and bad acting.<br /><br />Don't get all the positive reviews. Who would like this movie other than an 11 year old boy? If you find this funny then you must not be funny or it tells me something about comedy, how rare it is and how people will laugh at anything cause its so hard to come by.<br /><br />If you like stupid, go ahead and see it. If a man eating his own hand entertains you and cheesy fake demons go see it.<br /><br />Horror fan, yes. lover of comedy horror, sure, but not this.
B00715QREA|5|A wonderful film about a driven actor to prove his worth.
B00CWY76CC|5|What do you do if you don't have any thing to do you down load this and is a grate  game for your kids and adults ..
6305558167|5|I love movies like this that shows the ages of knighthood.I think it was done as best as anyone could of hoped for. I have seen the VHS and DVD versions and own them both. If you like the classic tales of the past, You will love this one. I gave it 5 stars due to the way it makes you feel throughout the entire movie. THUMBS UP !!!!
B007IXWKUK|5|Another page turner I hated to put down and so fixing to get book 3. The author makes me feel like I'm right there. I can sooooo relate to Ana. These books are definitely worth the price you pay. Wanna see the first movie but knowing there are 3 books I will probably wait till all 3 are out. Keep an open mind while you read these books.
B0000025IE|5|ahhhhhhhh yesssss one the best metal albums ever .its true sometimes the classic bands are better. this is a excellent cd .old priest as well as metal classics &quot;breaking the law&quot; &quot;grinder&quot;  &quot;living after midnight&quot; and countless bands have tried to cover  grinder but no one does it like priest ..they are the best metal band  ever.hail j.p they rule.get this true metal fans this is a album one has to  have to call themselves a metal freak....outta here.
B002DQLGHU|5|Great movie, much fun and &#34;magical!&#34;  Can't wait to read the rest of the books & then watch the movies!
B007JRU2UK|3|Nothing special.  Good scenery.  Depressing but sometimes funny story.  Not sure why we tried it.
B009KS4XRO|5|I have spent many a happy hour playing this wonderful bingo game.  Lots of fun and challenges.  Thanks so much.
B00FAPF5U0|4|A challenging game. Few lifes so you can play and then go do something else....keeps you from being glued to the game. I am up to level 274 now and still enjoying the game. I recommend this game.
B005GFPZYK|5|Reminds me of my days as a squid my war was Viet Nam but hey a war is a war
B007J4T2G8|4|This book had a &#34;meet cute&#34; start and a fascinating insight into the BDSM world for the new & uninitiated.The character of Christian Grey was intriguing and the erotic scenes were fairly well done.  It had a logical and appropriate ending.
B002S8AH00|5|I actually had to return this movie because I already owned it.  But I love the movie and the digital copy is really good for trips!
B003730LRY|4|I remembered this movie fondly from years gone by.  My eight-year-old loved it!  It was wonderful to have a family movie with very few expletives &#34;Damn&#34;.  And the violence is minimal( Compared to &#34;kid&#34; movies where characters are killed and blown up) and humorous (I think). (The daughter  Wednesday is hilarious.).
B000QRIGLC|5|Powerful story
1416583432|5|got this for my son who has had a number  of dogs.  He reports leaning things he didn't know about dogs after reading just the first chapter.
B000E8QVWY|5|I'm anything but a Johnny Cash fan. The only time I got a kick out of his music was in the late Sixties (or early Seventies?), when he released his tongue-in-cheek hit, \\"Boy Named Sue.\\"  Very entertaining, in case you haven't heard it.  Otherwise, I paid scant attention to the Man in Black, other than knowing he sang about trains, and crime, and prison, and that he was a tad rambunctious.<br /><br />So when WALK THE LINE initially came out, my interest wasn't all that keen on learning about the troubled life of Cash (or his equally tumultuous romance with June Carter).  Two words got me to go see the film during its theatrical run--and to watch this exceptional movie several times since:  Joaquin Phoenix.  I'm a big fan of this remarkable, versatile actor, have been ever since seeing him in [[ASIN:B00009ZYBY Gladiator]].  And in Cash's biopic Phoenix doesn't disappoint:  he immerses himself in the character, becomes the troubled Man in Black--right down to the singer's deep baritone.  Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as the ever-aloof June Carter (ultimately June Carter Cash); Witherspoon is dead on, from June's feisty sassiness, to her twang and drawl.<br /><br />It's one thing not to appreciate the actual music--it's quite another to be blown away when two actors absolutely nail the actual music.  That's what makes WALK THE LINE such a great film:  it's completely, unequivocally, believable.  Further kudos go out to Robert Patrick, who plays Cash's forever-disapproving father (the Denethor of the Ozarks).  So don't let not being a fan of Johnny Cash keep you from seeing this film; if you haven't checked out WALK THE LINE, by all means do so.  And get rhythm, when you get the blues.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B00P42WROG|4|Not his best, but Stephen King is still King
B00AHDXTIK|1|the cord would not charge my device and then after a week of trying, the tip fell off and we just threw it away.
630521610X|5|Scream directed by Wes Craven is still a classic, one of the few horror films that actually work as a whole. You get a few laughs, some screams and at the end you want to watch the film over and over again. Behind the original Halloween, Scream is my second favorite horror flick. Great performances by Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Aqruette and Drew Barrymore. I highly recommend this movie, it's a real scream!
B00I3ULVLQ|5|Very fine product.  Easy to put on. Works well, saves my phone from my clumsiness! Clean, sleek and looks nice on my phone too.
0321965515|5|Congress should pass a law that will not allow a website to be set up unless the person designing the site has read this book at least twice. Seriously.<br /><br />This book helped me make a few changes to my web site that tripled my traffic and sales. Not to mention it made my web site far less cluttered and much easier to use.<br /><br />healthcare.gov take note....
B008XG1X18|5|Best app ever that's all I can say
B0015DWJX2|5|Loved this different way to tell a story by reading letters. The characters were easier to keep straight than I thought.<br />Highly recommend this book.
B009V5KI98|5|Love th old one better than any remake!
B00NQKWAIQ|1|Utter waste of time and money. Every track sounds way to similar for Floyd.
B0099RFVXQ|5|Okay I admit it, I'm old but still like the Super hero movie.  They've done a rather good job of mixing in somewhat normal humans with those that have super hero abilities.  Granted &#34;normal&#34; here includes intelligence beyond reason athletic skills beyond reason and shapely bodies that only can be seen on the big screen but all in all a nice mix.  Really enjoyed the Hulk's encounter with the bad guy.  Sort of high tech meets old school fight scene.  Short and sweet.
B00CO8D3G4|4|This book starts the process of thinking about how the world is changing.  I guess we are all late to the party but the quicker we see what is going on the faster we can chart a new course.
B002UM5BXW|4|Great read.
B00A8MGLAI|5|I read the book twice and love the movie. It takes some thought to get it all straight, and then it has a powerful meaning.
B0013K1ALE|5|It's the VHS version and then some. Better picture, better sound and the extras are cool. What's not to like? Niiiice!
055338595X|3|I waited and waited for the paperback to come out, so eager to read about my characters again, just to find out they did nothing. So many pages for George R.R. Martin to say so much and so little at the same time. Save yourself some time: Winter still hasn't come.
B000N2HBSO|3|It's just too much detail and too long for me to keep up with all the players. I think I've got Bates, Chase, and Seward down. The B listers are harder (Blairs, Stanton, etc.)
B006VFLIYK|4|Good read well written and starts off the series well.  You will definitely want to keep track of Will Robie on this series.
B0086700CM|5|this app is free,  completely awesome and addicting. the game lags at times but is hardly noticeable unless  u die unexpectedly or are at a high score where u cannot move as well....but it lasts for like 2 seconds and i love this game!
B0000028VT|5|Mariah must have been sent from up above to sing to the world because she really does have the voice of an angel. She has the most beautiful, soaringly, powerful, 7 octave voice I've ever heard and this CD is my favorite tied with Emotions. Every song on Music Box is a total masterpiece!!! There is not one song on this CD that I don't love. My favorites are Dreamlover which I can't listen to without singing and dancing, Hero (My all time favorite from Mariah. The song has such power, it's so meaningful and it's gotten me through a lot of hard obstacles in my life, not matter how many times I hear it, it never gets boring! My favorite version of Hero is live from the 1993 performance which can be heard on the Hero CD maxi single), Anytime You Need A Friend (I love the choir that sings in the background and every time I hear it, I feel like I'm in church with the words \\"If You Just Believe In me, I Will Love You Endlessly\\" which is what Jesus says in the Gospel!), Never Forget You (another amazing slow ballad and love the way Mariah sings), Without You (one of Mariah's best covers. Harry Nielson remake and Mariah's version is so much better and more beautiful than the original), Now That I know, Just To Hold You Once Again, and a ballad that has actually made me stop breathing for a second while it was playing a couple of times-All I Ever Wanted.<br /><br />All I Ever Wanted is the most powerful and romantic ballad Mariah has ever done in her whole career!! Her voice soars above anything and everything on this song, on this whole CD!! I am not married and hopefully I will get married one day and the song that I want playing when I have my first slow dance with my husband is All I Ever Wanted. It totally takes my breath away, vocally, musically and lyrically! If you are a romantic, you'll love All I Ever Wanted. I have had this CD since it came out in 1993 and I never have stopped listening to it, along with Emotions. Honestly, Music Box and Emotions are my favorite CD's of all time. Music Box really showcases Mariah's voice and music.<br /><br />Another song that I absolutely adore is the title track, Music Box. I love it because it actually features a music box and it's another song to showcase Mariah's amazing vocals!!! I also own the import of Music Box which includes THE BEST Mariah B-Side ever!!! The best, most incredible, most breathtaking B-Side ballad Mariah has ever done is called Everything Fades Away!! Everything Fades Away is such an incredible slow ballad and I love everything about this song. The music itself, the lyrics, amd most importantly, Mariah's angelic voice!!! The other B-Side, which also is an incredible slow ballad, that I also own on a Dreamlover single, is equal in every way to Everything Fades Away was only available on Mariah's Dreamlover single called Do You Think Of Me? If you are able to get Everything Fades Away and Do You Think Of Me?, they are so worth it!!! Even Mariah's B-Sides should have made it to number 1!!<br /><br />Music Box Spawned 2 #1's in the U.S. for Mariah. Dreamlover became Mariah's 7th #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hero was the 8th #1 on Billboard. The song Without You made it to number 1 on the U.K. charts but I feel that it should have made number 1 in the U.S. because it's one of Mariah's best vocal perfomances ever and every time I hear it, I get goosebumps!! I couldn't imagine not listening to this CD! A Must have for Mariah fans!!!ll time. Music Box really showcases Mariah's voice and music.

B009NQX48C|2|This is a review of the blu ray quality, not of the movie itself.<br /><br />For a catalog title coming from Universal, which typically has high quality transfers and releases, Fear was under whelming. Granted the movie is older, but I felt more could have gone into cleaning it up since it does say remastered (a lot of grain and dark lighting, even in the bright outdoor scenes), and the audio leaves a lot to be desired, as a matter of fact it is downright lousy.<br /><br />The most perplexing thing with the audio is Universal seemed to care or focus more on the soundtrack, which was pretty good, than the actual dialogue, which sounded muffled - I constantly had to raise and lower the volume on my tv at various points because the audio was so underwhelming.<br /><br />It is an upgrade from the DVD version, but considering the price tag, it is a bit to high (for a catalog title with the flaws this title has) and I would wait for the price to go down unless you have money to burn and absolutely love this movie.
B007PVHMCG|5|6 and 8 year old boys into Lego minecraft. Both had been to Lego camp. Not too hard for them.
B003JTHWJQ|1|I quit reading this. Like, I get it, God doesn't exist, I don't need 400 more pages to keep telling me that.
B0098VXN2Y|3|Not a comedy, it was sad. More of a drama. Be prepared to cry, and not of happiness! Was hoping to laugh more.
B00HXYKYIE|5|If you liked \\"Water For Elephants\\", you will love this story.  As usual, Jodi Piccoult has done her homework!  Her description of elephant mothering versus human mothering causes the reader to stop and think.  Her use of different character voices keeps the reader constantly wondering how these people are all related and what the outcome will be.  I had a difficult time pausing to digest all the nuances of the story.  It is a great story that you won't soon forget.
B00GST8UB8|5|ROBOCOP is a classic. It's a film that holds up and plays just as well as it did in 1987. This new bluray is the best the picture has looked. Add to that some great special features that any true ROBOCOP fan will love. My favorite feature is the commentary with director, one of the writers, and the producer. It's a very entertaining/informative track.This is also the unrated directors cut which is a bonus.
B000KX0HVY|5|Great Presley album a lot of his popular songs.
B00HT944D4|5|A great movie, Tom Hanks make a perfect Walt Disney.  Good story telling type of movie.  You will enjoy this one.
B00A1EOBJQ|5|I love the show.  Love the album.  Would recommend it to anyone.  I intend to purchase additional volumes as they become available.
B0036EH3XE|5|After my few years of LOST watching I have learned not to include spoilers when talking or writing about the show. Peeps should can the spoilers, and if you have not yet viewed the season AVOID them like you would an evil infection.<br /><br />Try not to be swayed by the haters. I will not defend against them, I will only say that season six was without a doubt the most complicated season to grasp as a whole and since that is the case, in the end split the fan base into several directions.<br /><br />Season six deals heavily in the islands mythology. Where season five dealt heavily in time travel and the history of Dharma, six almost releases itself from the grip of time all together. The Jacob/Man In Black theme is expanded and very hard to understand.  ACROSS THE SEA is the culminating point of the island mythology, where a major question was promised to be addressed. Well it was, but the answer that was given shattered the fan base into more pieces then a certain light house mirror that I wont get into specifics about.<br /><br />Lets just say that I believe about 99 point 9 percent of the viewers totally missed the point of Across the Sea. I thought that episode was completely bad ass. Since even the peeps who watched the episode fifty times still think my theory is wrong ands I dont want to include spoilers, You can check out what I really think at Lostblog.net.<br /><br />The production was not as lush as previous seasons in a lot of episodes, (except AB AETERNO, a brilliant Richard centric ep. which shows that Lost could easily remain on air as various movies of the week) and the pacing is way different, but it didn't stop me from watching and rewatching episodes over and over. This is the greatest show of all time, and I loved six as much as others. You should just try and enjoy the ride on the first go through, then assemble the puzzle after. Just remember, where season six may contain fifty puzzle pieces, most peeps just grabbed up three at the end, looked at them for three seconds and then declared that it didn't make any sense. The final episode, while great, isnt the culmination of the mythology presented in the series. And the answer will not smack you in the face as soon as it wraps.

The final episode, while great, isnt the culmination of the mythology presented in the series. And the answer will not smack you in the face as soon as it wraps.

B00A6CCF0K|5|Stephen King got this one right, there was no confusion about what he was writing, I used to follow his book all the time, and then his writing changed, so I stopped reading his works. This one is well written
B00P7PK6JS|5|Love covers a multitude of sins
B002MQYOFW|5|The book kept me on the edge of my seat with anticipation!  There is alot of action with a touch of romance! Very descriptive writing can put you right in the book!
B007VUA7VO|5|Great product that I'm using constantly to check how much battery is being used. The added bonus of letting me know how long each separate process will operate is also very useful. Thanks for a great product.
B000RW3YYA|5|I think Stargate series are best sci-fi TV shows ever. It keeps developing itself and they have good budget for production. Scripts are well written and stories are succesfully evolving.<br />DVD case does not occupy much space in terms of storage, which is excellent if you have hundreds of DVDs. I strongly recommend.
B00004XONN|5|Listen, I like the Aphex Twin, I really do. He's a very original artist. However, that doesn't mean that he or any of the other artists that techno-underground hipsters like to site in criticising this record have anything on Radiohead. Unlike Most people, I liked the Bends better than Ok Computer, and I probably like Kid A more than I like The Bends. Kid A reveals a depth and maturity in the crafting of a pop record that few artists can hold a candle to.  It is a mistake to compare this record to the like of The Aphex Twin. As creative as he is, his musical paradigm, along with that of most &quot;techno&quot; artists, is too limited and it is the sad result that for the most part they fall short of the emotional clarity and impact that radiohead has with this record.  I know people will disagree with me on this, and that's fine, but Kid A is not a techno album. It draws on electronic music as a source for inspiration, but from that point it rises above the simplistic disco roots of The Aphex Twin or DJ Shadow. Drawing from free jazz, blues, early electronic music a la Varese, rock, folk, and post-punk, Radiohead creates a gestalt musical entity that is not easily classified, particularly not by people who are more concerned with the number of artists they listen to that most people haven't heard of than they are with the quality, depth, and originality of music. Bottom Line, Radiohead is brilliant, and Kid A is an album unlike anyother. It radiates feeling and has real weight. From the first second to the last, the album never fails to communicate to the listener the bands intent in a very subtle and equally precise manner. When it soars, it carries you along with it, and when it curls up in the fetal position and bleeds on the floor, you feel the same way. Do yourself a favor and ignore the bad reviews, in 20 years this will be seen as a musical milestone on par with Abbey Road, Kinda Blue, Electric Lady Land, or London Calling. It's that good.
B0034G4P94|5|very good  well done
B00594XOZU|3|it's ok but it won't let me update. I haven't been able to update it for around five months or so...
B00KG2PQUQ|2|The movie was okay however the streaming quality ruined it for me. I couldn't go five minutes without it buffering and reloading.
B005P4P966|5|Great season, just wish the digital version included the special features. Asides that, if you are a bbt fan, this is a no brainer!
B001AVCFK6|5|I've been a fan of Star Trek for a long time and remember the original series (which I still consider to be the best).  This movie helps answers many of the questions I've had about the original series, and characters in general.  It is very well done, and I think that all Star Trek fans will appreciate it.  I'm glad I purchased it on Blu-Ray as this is something I'll watch again and again.<br /><br />Easily the best Star Trek movie I've seen, and the best movie I've watched in a long time.
B000N2HCM4|5|Very enjoyable to read. Informative and insightful.  Good account of Obama's life before he became a politician.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes history and biographies.
B00Q7WBGHG|5|so good
B003KRJNBW|5|Awesome! One of the more original Sci-fi post apocalypse films you will see. Don't need much cgi if you have a good story and good actors.
B000H2R71G|5|Clasic movie they just dont make them like this anymore had to get the whole set glad i went to amazon
B00IG2DOKM|5|Just starting the game. It seems like a good game.
B000067QMD|5|I love being able to pump, store, and freeze milk right in the bottle I'll be using to feed my baby. They fit the classic Avent bottles and the new natural style.
B00IG2DOKM|4|Kids love it
B00E3D7WGU|1|I swear this was recorded with a potato. HORRIBLE SOUND QUALITY. Concerts from the 1970's sound better than this. She should know better. HORRIBLE. DO NOT BUY.
B009UX2YAC|5|This Game Is Amazing I Would Recommend This Endless Runner To Every Person I Know. Clearly Better Than Temple Run And Temple Run 2.
B006WSKTPU|5|Funny show! !
B00B5HQL50|3|Skyfall was entertaining but how many 007 movies have been based on rogue agents that are seeking revenge?  Seems like 1/2 the franchise is based on that premise.<br /><br />I also have to complain about Unbox, why is this not have HD?
B009UX2YAC|4|I really love this game but there is a lot of errors with the game itself.  For example, this game freezes sooooo much.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I want the full game
B000021Y77|4|The beginning of Run Lola Run has a narrator stating how countless questions result in answers which in turn gives rise to other questions, and so on, in a chain of answers followed by questions.  &quot;But in the end, isn't it always the same question, and always the same answer?&quot;  The main question might be, will anything I do differently have any consequences?  Or why did this happen?<br />Lola's boyfriend Manni has just botched a drug deal, losing 100,000 marks.  He has to turn over the money to his connection, a nasty and forbidding bald guy, who will kill him in twenty minutes if he doesn't deliver the goods.  Lola, calm, usually on time, and loyal as ever, does what she can to help out her man, who increasingly desperate as time runs out, considers holding up the local supermarket to get the money.  She's running a race against time, encountering all sorts of people, including a bicycle courier, a Mr. Meyer who's a colleague of her father, and her father, a humorless, ice-in-his-veins banker who's carrying on with one of his female colleagues, who is pregnant.<br />This portrays three different scenarios of Lola running to save Manni, and demonstrates how one small action or variation can have enormous consequences on other people.  An example is the blonde woman walking with the baby carriage.  Each time she responds differently to Lola dashing by her.  We then see in a series of quick still photo montages what would later happen to her.  In one version, she ends up injured from an attack; in another, she ends up winning the lottery.  Another is how long the conversation between Lola's father and his lover has progressed before Lola bursts in on them, asking her father for money.  Each time, the outcome is different, affecting her father's attitude to her and what Lola does.<br />Another interesting aspect is Lola's piercing glass-shattering scream, which becomes the emanation of her desperation, whether it to be telling her boyfriend to shut up so he can calm down, or her anger at her father refusing to help her.<br />Franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light.  She gives credibility in a character who is so much more with it than her boyfriend, whose over-reliance on her makes him incompetent, pathetic, and lacking direction.<br />Director Tom Tykwer must have been influenced by music videos as the swift jump cuts in scenes, nothing that requires a bottle of Dramamine by the TV set, mind you, as the pulsing techno score, matching Lola's frantic running, attest to.  An interesting piece of cinema from Germany, great in style and structure.an calm down, or her anger at her father refusing to help her.<br />Franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light.

B007J4T2G8|5|This book is a great read. It's different but captivating. Rereading them allows for those smaller details to be made evident.
B0013NAP2G|5|Excellent Music Video and Live Performances by Mariah! Some nice hits from her new CD &#34;The Emancipation of MIMI which is an outstanding CD. I highly recommend this DVD!
B000JMKTLO|5|I liked it. Camille's troubles are displayed beautifully and for the most part you don't totally suspect who did it till close to the end.
B005K17RU0|4|This is a great app. I use it all the time and it is very accurate, even for my little out of the way place. I like their android version even better as it gives an extended forecast even longer (30days) which helps me plan trips, being more informed weather wise. It also helps me plan for allergies days, frost and garden days, etc. I find what the weather is along trip routes and destinations. Great app. Thanks
B007EDYN36|4|Being a big fan of Kiss, really enjoyed this book about peter criss' life with and without Kiss. Lots of good dirt , and stories about the road. I think any rockker would definately like this book.
B0064MPXFA|5|Amazing. I can't stop watching!
B001ANSSDC|5|Now I am ready for the movie. Love the characters and the twists in the plot!<br />Great book for a rainy day!
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is the best game of all time. I would never stop playing it. It is so awesome I could die for it. I am so glad I have it.
B000I3UMLQ|2|Hmmm... this bordered on sacrilegious. I hated this movie at the theatre when it came out. My opinion hasn't changed much.
B00AHQNHSY|3|Glad to finally come across a player that works on the kindle fire. Not bad and its free, thanks. I like this app.
B00HGJ18C2|4|This is a great game. Pay no attention to all the advertising on and bottom. The game is fun!
0553381407|5|I found this book to be incredibly eye-opening and helpful, both as the daughter of a toxic mother and the parent of two children.  The only thing that I am not sure about is whether confronting the toxic parent is always the best option.  The most obvious questions in my mind were \\"What's the point?  Why do you still want ANY relationship with this person?  Why do you feel you owe this person ANYTHING?  At what cost are you willing to keep trying?\\"  Several years ago I made the very difficult decision to end my relationship with my mother when, after years of trying so hard to keep some relationship going and suffering for it, I finally found the courage to ask \\"what's in it for me?\\" and realized the answer was \\"absolutely nothing positive whatsoever\\".  Also, being disgusted by her interactions with my children was a big factor.  I profoundly miss having a mother, but I do not miss her or her poison.
B000NIVJHM|5|Its the summer of 1963 and Baby is stuck at the Catskills with her parents. Attempting to make the best of the situation, Baby attends the organized classes on merengue dancing and wig demonstration. Suddenly, all of that changes when she meets Johnny Castle, the resort's dance instructor. With Johnny, Baby learns the steps to a new dance--a dirty dance--that allows her to discover new strengths and new talents in order to define her place in a rapidly changing world. Under the influence of Rhythm and Blues, Baby can now express herself and her love for Johnny. It's very romantic and heart warming movie. Not only that but it makes you want to get up dance through the most of the movie.
B004J4WLB4|5|What a wonderful story!  It was difficult to put it down.  I bought the book on the recommendation of a member of my garden club.  She just raved about it.  I have thanked her for telling me about it.  It gives you a hard look at what happens to children in foster care and the wounds that result from being abandoned many times.  It also gives you hope and introduces you to the language of flowers.  Nature and flowers provide a communication channel and a way to connect to the world.  I highly recommend to this book, especially to someone who loves to garden.
B005QJZ5FA|5|I am loving this cd so much. The melodies are sultry and the lyrics are excellent. So many gems on this one album.
B001OQCV2E|2|Noah never had it so good.  All he had was a lot of rain. Now thanks to CGI we have earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunami's and other explosions and fireballs that makes the end of the world seem like fun.  Ouch! John Cusack with two small children, an ex-wife and her new husband in tow helps start a brave new world. With Cusack and his ex still having feelings for each other you just know the new husband will die.  He does.  Woody Harrelson has a brief role as a tree-hugging conspiracy nut-case who believes when the world ends we will all fly off in spaceships.    The main and top-most problem with the movie is it's ridiculousness. Since Cusack is the star he has the super-human ability to survive road chasms, they open up just as he passes, skyscrapers tumble and the debris misses his car as he drives by, bridges collapse and in mid-collapse he sails under in his stretch limousine. He is a limo driver who earns his bread and butter driving rich folks around while he forgets he was once a novelist whose first book sold 422 copies.    After we're treated to seeing famous landmarks destroyed including the vatican with the Pope in mid-prayer and a Tibetian temple with a monk in mid-prayer, everyone who's anyone, with a few thousand nobodies and animals all end up on an ark. And to make some kind of point that escapes me, the everyone who's anyone are politicians. Egads! I think I'll pass on that trip.    The movie at 2 hours 38 minutes is a bit long for an old-fashioned Saturday afternonn time-waster but the special effects are good.    Whether it was intentional or not the movie offers up a tribute to the old Sanford and Son TV series that starred Redd Foxx.  Whenever Fred Sanford wanted his own way he would clutch his chest and talking to his dead wife would say \\"I'm coming Elizabeth, I'm coming\\"  Danny Glover plays the president whose wife has passed and when he looks out the White House window and sees a tidal wave coming, he looks up to heaven and says, \\"I'm coming Elizabeth, I'm coming home\\".
0671027344|4|The book \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a good book. This book was also very similar to the book \\"A Catcher in the Rye.\\" This book takes you through the life of a boy, that as you read more and more you grow to think that you know everything about him, but then after reading it you realize that you never really understood anything about him. This book has interesting characters, a descriptive plot, and a good theme to go along with all of that. I recommend this book to many readers, because it is an excellent book to read!   -Greg
B004H4XDBI|5|If you love romance and the analysis of human frailties, this is a must read for you. Readers, young and old, will also learn from the dissection of the highs and lows of the music profession.
B00AZMFJYA|5|I bought this for my husband who has been watching Star Trek since a young boy. He really enjoyed it. I was able myself to keep up with all the action.
B003IEJZUG|4|I really enjoyed this book, though it was a slow start. I believed the story and that kept me wanting to read it to the end. I found the religious references quite appropriate in light of the character. I did not feel the book to be \\"preachy\\", but it did invoke some interesting considerations. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, albeit incredible story.
B0083SBMBM|5|I am very pleased that I finally own this movie. I purchased it for a great price and I could not be happier.
B009WO7NQO|4|I installed it for my grandson and he really likes it. I even play it along with him and we both enjoy it.
B004XISI4A|4|extremely captivating on the same footsteps as the other books of the series.... can't wait for the next one.  The first part starts off a bit slow in order the set up the various story-lines.  As it moves forward it grasps exponentially the reader interest.
B002GHHHM4|5|Watch this movie to see the master at work. The philosophy and physicality of Bruce Lee made this movie the standard for all to follow in Kung Fu cinema. Enter the Dragon is a superb legacy of Bruce Lee's spirit and achievement.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Love it!
B00NEQRNVG|4|It was a good read but I was sad it wasn't the last one. I really wanna know what happens.
B004DLPXAO|5|I like this app when I sit at my computer it's nice to have the print is bigger on my monitor.
6302293553|5|tremendiously funny!  I couldnt stop laughing! Great quotes like &quot;NI!&quot; had me rolling on the floor, laughing!
0385334206|5|I usually take forever to finish books (I'll start another one in the middle of one or just lose interest) but I read this one straight through cover to cover. Vonnegut is a brilliant satirist and this book had me laughing throughout. This book inspired me to buy Slaughterhouse Five which I hope to get around to reading soon.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|I would give it a 3.5. Very interesting. Thought provoking story about actions and consequences. Would read other books by this author.
B006GKHE6G|4|Pros:<br />-Amazing graphics, best water racing game out, hands down!<br />-Smooth gameplay with no lag<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Could improve by putting more customization<br />-Need more varieties of races to reduce repetitiveness
B00ABGEFWC|1|Everything is geared towards selling more coins or stuff. Three year old was very annoyed very quickly with all the up-selling stuff. Not worth the money!
B006LSZECO|2|RIGHT from the beginning it was predictable,girl meets guy...they fall in love,then things fall apart...Gillian Flynn uses the F Word way too<br />Much!!!
0345511468|4|The amazing books about Star Wars and Empire strikes back get their last companion in the making of Return of the Jedi. The worst in the best trilogy, it is still a great movie with epic moments. The book is perhaps a little less interesting than the first two, in my opinion anyway, just because of the weaker movie. Lets just not hope that we have to spend money on the making of Phantom Menace...
B00007BH5C|5|After seeing the movie and listening to the soundtrack several times over, I really can't make up my mind which of the two movies has the better soundtrack.  One thing is clear, though.  This is not simply the Fellowship score with a few additions.  I know some people have posted otherwise, butI respectfully disagree.  There is music to tie us back to the first movie, but most is all brand new.  In fact, Shore has done a wonderful job linking the music without simply rehashing it.<br />My favorite is the score for the riders of Rohan.  It features a Norweigan fiddle and is absolutely beautiful. <br />Admittedly, there isn't a lot in the way of lighthearted and comforting music in this one, like there was in the Shire and Rivendell in the Fellowship.  However, this is a darker film, and the music fits it wonderfully.<br />This is a CD worth buying, especially for Rohan's theme.
B003UESJH4|5|I teach public speaking to undergraduate students and this is great film for them to see.  For added fun, serve popcorn.
B008BQ8YHQ|3|So, women are now holding all the highest levels of corporate and legal levels. And minorities are judges, too, in every court house. In what alternate universe did this evolve in. I am sick and tired of watching Hollywood propaganda to get one to believe this is happening. Are we transforming America with sitcom propaganda from the left outright all the time. What a sad state our country is in!
B006LSZECO|5|Gillian Flynn did an amazing job with this novel. I love mysteries and this one kept you so engaged the entire time. There are so many surprise twists and turns and the ending is just as shocking. I didn't want it to end.
B00846REIS|5|This was a fun book.  The writing was witty and sexy.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and the introduction to Gideon and Eva.
B004ZMWUCU|5|I loved every word of this beautifully written book.  Great Irish characters figuratively come alive.  They are endearingly funny, tragic and endlessly loveable.  I wish I had not already read it, just so I could enjoy it all again!  Read it.  You will love it and you won't soon forget it!
B000E6G6DK|5|I have to say this album is exceptional. The instrumentation, the vocals, the lyrics the arrangement. This is an awesome soul album! It has all the genre of the late 70's classic soul brought new. I have heard folks make that statement a 1000 times...This time it rings true. For those of you who don't grab and enjoy the auditory desert of this album and you claim you like neo-soul or just good music,,,,, you will miss out if you don't experience On the jungle floor!!! holla
B00AREIAI8|4|Lots of instutions at begning I like how the levels go fast.,it is such a great horse game and I jst got it.
B0010SKUYM|4|The story is written in a captivating way, by an arrogant bastard of a main character. Boy genius is in love with what I can only describe as a woman with a history of trauma and borderline presentation. Too close to home to be comfortable if you've ever been in that relationship. It's like watching a train wreck. Rothfuss nails things like fight/flight response and codependent behavior like he's been there.<br /><br />My only real complaints are that the reverse deus ex machina, which seems to rain terror down on a young teen, gets old after a while. While Rothfuss does a good job of making the heroes have shades of gray, his villains are far too one dimensional. The universe seems rich and makes me want to explore it in a level of detail that the book is painfully slow to get into. Still, it's impossible to deny the world building effort that must have gone on behind the scenes.<br /><br />I enjoyed Name of the Wind, but I felt like I needed a good long break before jumping into the second book. It's worth reading, but with caveats.
B00957T6X6|4|I will not go over the story here. That has been done again and again.<br />I am reading this with a Kindle Fire 8.9 inch screen.<br />These were very well ported into a single file. There are nice links in the text for larger maps. And is easy to read on the Kindle Fire.
B00F91SCXC|3|This movie was definitely entertaining until the end.  A lot of action and twists and turns.  I didnt give it a 4 because of the lack of originality.  Theaters are flooded with movies about &#34;end of world.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5|Definitely one of my favorite games! Totally addicted!  Just wish I had more friends that play :/ could use the help
0743486285|5|Kind of hard to follow if you try to read like a &#34;book&#34;. Its a diary so its random and all over the place. Once you embrace that, its a real trip to get an inside peek into the CRAZY lives these guys lived.
B00000JHAU|5|The first B&amp;S song I ever heard was Judy and the Dream of Horses and the second was Fox in the Snow. They are still my favorite songs on here, but there is nothing bad about this CD. I was watching the movie Pumpkin a few weeks ago (it was a terrible movie, by the way, in my opinion. I guess it was trying to be funny, but NO ONE really acts the way Christina Ricci did in that. Ridiculous.) and the song Stars of Track and Field is in it. There's really no point to this story, except it's a fantastic song and it sounded like it had been written for the movie. I worked as a lifeguard at a girl scout camp one summer and I always made them listen to this at the pool. I think they enjoyed that. Get Me Away From Here I'm Dying has one of the better melodies I've ever heard. So, you don't need to go off and see a minister before buying this, because it's really good.
B004289ZW0|2|I don't have the swipe-on/swipe-off problem other folks have in this forum.  That feature seems to work fine.  What I am disappointed in is its basic specs.  I should have been a bit more suspicious when basic stats such as accuracy and refresh rate are impossible to find on the GNS web site.  Upon receiving the unit, I can confirm the following:    It uses an older version MediaTek chipset.  As a result, its accuracy is no better than the internal GPS on the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.  In fact, in general, if the GNS 5870 is showing a horizontal accuracy of 10 meters and a vertical accuracy of 10 meters (10/10), then the internal GPS of the iPhone 4 will typically show 5/10.  iPad 2 was a little closer, sometimes beating the GNS, most of the time matching it.  This was tested using GPS-Status app from the app store.  Its refresh rate is only 1hz and is not configurable.      I would have expected a unit such as this to have much better accuracy than the internal chipsets, and for it to not have at least a 5 hz refresh rate is pretty lame.    On the plus side, its Bluetooth pairing is quite fast and reliable.  As a result, I could recommend this product as a backfill for non-GPS iPods and iPads, as well as older GPS-enabled models.  I cannot recommend it as a more accurate replacement for internal chipsets on the latest models of iPhones and iPads.
B005V2EVBQ|4|This is lightweight and in expensive, we are very pleased with this product. If it had a built in screen protector I would have rated it 5 star.
B000002KOQ|5|This album captures best the innocence and beauty of Joni Mitchell's voice. This was my first Joni Mitchell record. It played like sunshine, beautiful sun shining on a glistening stream, and made me smile every time I heard it. What's amazing about this record is that it can still create that magic for me today. So many miles, so many years, so many trials and still Ms. Mitchell makes me smile. There are a few singers, songwriters, that can touch your soul with a smile the lasts a lifetime.<br />Play Morning Morgantown and see if you, like me, have a simple sweet smile appear on your face and the knowledege in your heart that her music was and is a gift that has stood the test of time.
B002WJI658|5|Very well-made, bright and clean.  My son expects the plush things to be exactly the same as the video character.  Worth every penny since it pleased my very particular child!
0441172717|5|I first saw the movie &quot;Dune&quot;, which is awful.  David Lynch revels in the grotesque and overuses character thoughts (which works in the text but is overbearing in the movie) to ruin a good thing.  Fortunately,  the book is one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read.  It is  chock full of archetypal themes, including the hero journey, and is just  simply gripping.  There is superb character development, internal and  external character tension, and a helluva good story.  If you saw the movie  and hated it, approach the book with an open mind.  It does not have many  of Lynch's absurd interpretations or fabrications and will astonish you
B00D7NWTSI|5|ok
B000002JKA|4|Awake is a slightly heavier release than the classic Images &amp; Words. This album has a great dark feel to it, exemplified by songs like &quot;Voices&quot;, &quot;The Mirror/Lie&quot;, and &quot;Space Dye Vest&quot;. Despite some stellar numbers, there are also a few mediocre tunes that bring the overall rating down.<br />6:00 (7/10):There's a cool groove to the riff that starts this song off. One of the problems I have with this song, which Dream Theater does far too often, is the spoken voice-overs that occur at certain points. This is a very typical, good DT song. Nothing too out of the ordinary here.<br />Caught in a Web (6/10): Catchy chorus with good output from LaBrie, decent main riff, uninspired solo. Not much else to say, a pretty average DT song overall.<br />Innocence Faded (8/10): This song is a great throwback to the 80s. I've said in other reviews that I love the 80s, so it gets points for that. LaBrie does some great work doing both gentle vocals and his high power shrieks. Petrucci offers good stuff throughout the whole song, and solo has a sort of Journey-like feel to it (at least I see it that way).<br />Erotomania (9/10): A blistering instrumental with fast and slow parts. Petrucci takes center stage on this song, of course, but you do hear input from the rest of the band (minus LaBrie, of course). He even does a short but impressive rendition of a classical piece during the most intense part of the song. This song is a great combination of speed, technicality, and feeling. It is made even more potent by the seamless transition into the next song (Erotomania is the first of a 3-part suite).<br />Voices (9/10): The intro to this song is a great riff that breaks suddenly into the most gentle vocals from LaBrie with just piano in the background. This song is loaded with emotions, on the soft parts and on the more intense parts. Even the guitar solo, while being incredibly fast, manages to maintain a sense of the feeling surrounding it at the sametime. The song is dark and haunting, and certainly one of the best on the album.<br />The Silent Man (8/10): This is a short acoustic song, but it is quite well-done. It ends the trilogy suite that Erotomania and Voices are a part of, and it also echoes part of Erotomania during a short bridge.<br />The Mirror (7/10): The heaviest song on the album. There's not a lot that stands out on it, but it picks up a nice melody where James starts singing &quot;Let's stare the problem right in the eye...&quot;. It also segues flawlessly into Lie, the next song.<br />Lie (8/10): The vocals have such a cool sense of rhythm that is quite rare for the band. When the song returns to the same segue that ended The Mirror, expect to hear John Petrucci's best speed solo, which is fast, complex, and still loaded with emotion.<br />Lifting Shadows off a Dream (6/10): The vocals are nice, and there are some good non-guitar instrumental sections. It feels like something is lacking, though.<br />Scarred (9/10): Probably the best song on the album. There are so many ranges of emotion and musical intensity wrapped up in this song. It starts with a fantastic blues solo by Petrucci, some gentle vocals by LaBrie, and then on to the metal part. There's a part where LaBrie sings &quot;Do you feel... you don't know me anymore...&quot; that conveys such a strong feeling of understanding that the listener can relate to. It's my favorite part of the whole song, and possibly of the whole album. The guitar solo (not the intro) is fairly run-of-the-mill, though.<br />Space Dye Vest (8/10): One of the most unique songs the band has ever done (it is mostly regarded by the band as Kevin Moore's song, which is why they won't play it live without him). There is a lot of voice-over in this song, but unlike the other songs which have voice-over, it feels like part of the song, so it isn't distracting. There are some fine piano parts here and there, especially towards the ending. <br />7.73/10, or 4/5. I don'trecommend this as your first DT album, but you will definitely want it once you have gotten into some of their other work.
B00BH0VSM6|4|always enjoy his books, some of the best of their genre....PdeZ
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is one out of many games that makes you use your brain.i play it all the time.get this game if u like a challenge.have fun.
B005K0HDGE|5|Loved it and as always developed characters that you seem to have met somewhere sometime.  A love story with a historical touch
1401308201|5|I haven't seen the show yet but it's finally coming to the Uk (London) in September this year (2006), I'm really looking forward to see Wicked in December. The book is a great read but be warned it does contain spoilers. Fantastic behind the scenes facts, and full information on various cast members who have played the parts since its opening. A must to go with the Wicked sound track .
B00I325J2Q|5|This has got to be the best show to even hit television. It deserves 10/5 stars. The cast, director, writer, etc is outstanding in their devotion to this amazing series. I am a true to heart fan and always will be. The Walking Dead stands as the greatest show in history.
0763644765|5|I bought this book for my son when he was about 18 months old.  He loves to sit on the potty and read the potty book.  It's a simple book with good solid pages.  It is fun to read and the illustrations are great.
B008B8A9V8|4|Great clear illustrations and explanations.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love God's word,  this is the book above all books. It has a daily verse that is inspiring to read daily. You can't go wrong reading God's word.
B008AIGWVA|5|Lots of fun. Every one will like it. Just can't get the mix right. Anyone know what it is? Please let me know
B00OALBUZY|5|Loved the idea of looking back and glimpsing a version of what could have been pre-vampiric Dracula. I speculated that this movie, given the backstory premise, would not infringe upon or conflict with my long held Dracula favorites from a story perspective, and it absolutely did not. Dracula Untold managed to take what is already a fairly tragic figure and made the Dracula story even more tragic. So, this is a wonderful addition to the saga. Additionally, Luke Evans' portrayal was so amazingly warm and endearing that any of Vlad's brutality only added to the personal tragedy of the character. One bitter-sweet result from this movie - where I thought that I was safe in watching Dracula Untold as it would not conflict with old Dracula standards, I now find that I have a new favorite portrayal of Dracula on my hands; and, I cannot wait for what will surely be an incredible upcoming sequel(s).
B001EYGOEM|5|Love her-Love the CD! I can't quit listening to it, it's become the background music to my life! lol! I
B00FN5Z8UY|5|Good show at a good price.  Hopefully 5 is as good.

B000069AUI|5|Awesome.
B00P7PJ9P0|5|Just what I expected. Highly recommend.
B000VNMMRA|3|Ok, the description on this DVD definitely said it came with a DTS track, and yet there is no track.  I am highly dissapointed and angry.
B00AREIAI8|5|Best horse game for the kindle fire. Great game for everyone,  young or old. No complaints yet. Loads pretty quick too!
B000O77SOK|1|12/21/10: Where are the other seasons ????? Like others before me... I refuse to purchase a small fraction of a series on DVD without the promise of a complete set in the forseable future. I made that mistake with the Peyton Place TV series... bought \\"Parts\\" 1 & 2... and then NOTHING else was released !!! NEVER AGAIN !!!<br /><br />5/12/12 Addendum: So now it's been almost 1.5 years since my plaintive cry for the ENTIRE series on DVD... with NOTHING to show for it !!!! PLEASE release the ENTIRE series !!!!!<br /><br />8/5/13 Addendum: So now it's been almost 3+ years since my plaintive cry for the ENTIRE series on DVD... with still NOTHING to show for it !!!! PLEASE release the ENTIRE series !!!!!
B00I2TW0UO|5|I like this one as much as I did the first one! Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job! Can't wait for the next two.  Even though I have read the series, I am still loving the movies!
B00QROH0QK|5|Love it, love it, love it.  This is my 3rd time watching it and it is still just as good.  Can't wait for the seques.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I thought all the graphics were AWESOME!I love the squares and triangles and other worlds other worlds ! So cool !
0792153367|5|I love this movie. From the first scene when Holly(Audrey Hepburn) alighted from the yellow cab to have breakfast in front of Tiffany to  the very last scene when Holly and Paul(George Peppard) reunited and kissing in the rain.<br />Mesmerizing film, shine in all departments. Excellent adaptation from Truman Capote's same name novel. Skillful directing by Blake Edwards and flawless performances from both the leads and not forgetting great supporting casts. This role was made for Audrey Hepburn, she was graceful, witty, charismatic and totally awesome. One of her best performance ever!<br />The story was about a free spirited and helpless Holly Golightly who lived with a nameless 'Cat', didn't want to own anything and afraid of love and commitments. Life pretty much socializing because holly's goal in life to marry one of the richest man under 50. Things take a twist with Paul Varjak moved into the apartment below hers. Paul was a struggling writer who actually a kept man by a rich lady. They became neighbour to friends then soul mate and eventually lovers.<br />This is not the usual romance story, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is a timeless classic, showed sincerity, sensibility and class.<br />I also love the song of this movie \\"Moon River\\". Who can forget the part when Holly plucking the strings of the guitar and singing it \\"moonnn----riv---ver\\"...... <br />This movie touch my heart with memorable characters, song, etc and I've watched it from time to time because each time I watch it, I renewed the feeling. Marvellous vintage classic.Simply divine!
B00000J2PH|5|A beautiful classic. A perfect combination of catchy, well-remembered melodies with the intimate, deeply touching voice of Carole King in this all-time favorite album, that manages so much enjoyment today as when it first came out.It contains such songs, as \\"I feel the earth move\\", \\"So far away\\", \\"It's too late\\" or \\"Beautiful\\". <BR>And remember: It's too late, baby, so we really did try to make it, something inside has died and I can't hide and I just can't fake it.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Manning Deluxe is hours of fun. Keeps you wanting to challenge the games timer and very addicting. What better way to keep the mind sharp and still enjoy a calming game.
B001M4YZ90|1|What are you doing Gerard Butler?  I purchase this movie based on him being in it and was that ever a huge mistake.  Maybe it's just the genre and a sign of modern (too modern) times.  I didn't get it.  I thought it sucked big time.  I couldn't get even half way through it.  To go further, it was obvious I was going to become violently ill.  Oh, Gerard.  You need to do something big to make up for this one.
B0001UL7RY|1|Lets see, another CD by Avril Lavigne, the \\"Anti Brittany\\".  Everybody thinks she is more talented than Brittany Spears, but when you listen to these singers, Brittany Spears definately has the best voice of the two.  Now, saying Brittany has a better voice than Avril Lavigne isn't much of a compliment, since even Marge Simpson has a better voice than Avril Lavigne, but if I had to choose between these two pop stars, I'd choose Brittany, no question. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, I've never been a fan of manufactured pop, but the manufactured pop of Brittany Spears is much easier on the ears than the screaming anger rock of Avril Lavigne.  This music is LOUD.  Loud, loud, loud.  Avril Lavigne's voice is harsh, screechy, and annoying.  She sounds like a cat with its balls caught in a vice.  How anybody could consider the raging screams of a whiney teenager \\"music\\" I'll never know.  Avril Lavigne's fans probably think gang graffiti is more attractive than a Leonardo DaVinci masterpiece, and that a trailer park is more beautiful than the Taj Mahal.  I bet these people probably think a stagnant pool of water is more spectacular than Angel Falls!  Such is the taste of anybody that thinks a bratty suburban delinquint screaming at the top of her lungs is \\"music\\". <br /> <br />If you insist on listening to prefab pop, at least listen to someone who can carry a tune without everyone in the room going deaf.  Kelly Clarkson, Christina Agulira, Celine Dion, Laura Branigan...ANYBODY but Avril!
B008JFUORW|5|I absolutely love this movie series! This last one had some dull moments, but the extra at the end was unbelievably hilarious!
B00IFORVEQ|4|This is a great conclusion to the show. I felt like all of the loose ends were wrapped up. Good job!
B001GCUNYO|5|Liam is superb as the loving Father dealing with every parents nightmare. He convincingly led us on his journey to find his daughter and his frustrations became mine. Made me glad I had sons.
B00T3DNKIE|3|Did not enjoy as much as To Kill A Mockingbird. Wordy at times.
B00J11U4J6|3|its okay, but good for kids
B008Y7N7JW|4|I loved the book, but the movie underwhelmed me in some ways. Certain moments that I thought were really powerful got edited out. Maybe they will show up in the second movie, but I doubt it. I also thought the costuming for the Capital folk was not as well done as it could have been. The acting was solid though, and I cannot WAIT to see the second one with the great additions they've made - Phillip Seymour Hoffman specifically.
1416955070|5|Great series--obviously better than the movie.
B0063IH60K|5|this sure was a quick app to load and great to pass the time and great for the kindle fire
B0000AQS6R|5|It was disappointing to find out that this DVD is not being sold in stores at the present time, so I was thrilled to find it available through Amazon.  Thank you so much for your very prompt service and for the excellent condition of this product.  William Byers
B002QE3CTY|4|A surprisingly very well; made exciting movie. It was extremely interesting and well made. It stimulated my interest enough to read the book. I really enjoyed the movie.
B00KGRFV92|5|I am a Marine Vet of Iraq and Afghanistan, so I was indoctrinated into the Corps on these guys' stories. They truly are the greatest generation. I think this show does a great job of bringing their stories to life so that the U.S. people can respect their service.
B00003CXCT|1|It turns out that Lucas was never as talented as anyone thought he was.  The only reason why the original Star Wars films turned out to be a fun trilogy is because he was prevented by either budget or special effects limitations of the time period.  Otherwise, the films would have turned out to be the overblown messes his latest trilogy is turning out to be.  The evidence?  The so-called special editions of his original trilogy.  <br />The worst offenses of these retooled films arises when Lucas creates new scenes which largely consist of Jar Jar Binks level comic relief.  The second worse offenses consist of unnecessary CGI characters added to pre-existing scenes which are glaringly obvious and look completely out of place.  The least of Lucas' offenses consist of touch-ups on old special effects which, in a few cases, are actual improvements.  But even then, Lucas manages to screw up, especially at the end of A New Hope when the original exciting scene of the Death Star blowing up is replaced by an extremely lame burst of light.<br />ILM has fallen too much in love with having actors perform in front of blue screens with obviously computer-generated characters.  At least in the \\"new\\" scene of Han Solo conversing with Jabba the Hutt Harrison Ford actually got to perform on a real set, but Jabba himself looks extremely pathetic in comparison to the animatronics version seen in Return of the Jedi and, furthermore, is much smaller in size.  This scene did not make the first release of A New Hope because they did not have the technology to create Jabba, but in retrospect this was a blessing.  Jabba comes off as a joke when seen walking beside Han and demanding his money.<br />For those who have only seen the retooled ET on DVD, Spielberg's changes (e.g. replacing the government agents' guns with walkie-talkies, and cleaning up the kids' dialogue) are far less ridiculous or a kick in the fans' teeth in comparison to the changes Lucas made.  Lucas and Spielberg really need to leave their old movies alone.  I dread to think what would happen to THX-1138 (a happy ending complete with a Busby Berkley muscial number and guest appearances by a computer generated Elmo perhaps?).
B00005JLS0|3|I had such high hopes with this pairing of the king and queen of romantic comedies. How could it miss? But it does. Don't get me wrong -- it's highly watchable and isn't bad, and it's something I'll enjoy renting in the future to watch again. But the sparks, the chemistry that I expected just fizzled. Sandra Bullock's character was too stiff -- and there was no back story to indicate why despite the distracting presence of her character's parents. As for Hugh's character, his family (brother, mother and father) were ever-present, but their was no explanation as to why he was the way he was.  The movie wanted you to develop this sympathy for these two lost lonely -- but funny in a quirky sort of way -- souls, but I found myself looking at my watch 40 minutes into the film.<br />Bottom line: I think the movie just tried too hard to cash in on Sandra Bullock's past successes. Is it coincidental that her character's name is Lucy -- the same name as her character in her best (in my opinion) movie to date, \\"While You Were Sleeping\\"? And the role of \\"best friend\\" is the actress who played her fellow contestant who turned into friend in \\"Miss Congeniality\\" (another cute movie). Sandra Bullock's a good actress...but she needs to stretch her acting chops and get past the romantic comedies as she's quickly outgrowing her abilities in this genre...it's becoming \\"been there, done that\\" with her.<br />The movie's one saving grace? Mr. Hugh Grant. He just gets better and better...and his acting is on par in this movie as he doesn't resort either into the role of cad or down-on-his-luck (yet adorable) loser. And he's not too tough to look at, either!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This game has a lot of things minecraft doesn't have.
B006VFLIYK|4|Baldacci can be a bit up and down.  But this one is a good summer read, bought it to take a break from serious reading and found myself limiting myself so that the tale would last a bit longer.  The temptation to plow through it was significant, great plot, good character formation, well written.
B000XXTCF8|5|If your a Van fan you probably have most of the good stuff already. However if you want a condensed album of hits this would work. I listen to it at work and it puts me in a good mood.
B0046B8GEQ|3|I found this movie empty of value, and unrealistic.<br />Furthermore, some portions were disgusting, such as the minions sitting on the scanner and laughing at the results.<br />Though not a bad movie, in a sense, it is just void of anything of quality- empty entertainment.<br />I felt it was a waste of time and attention, and I'd not recommend this movie to anyone.  I would recommend &#34;UP&#34;, instead because it has a beautiful &#34;moral of the story&#34;.
030758836X|5|GONE GIRL<br /><br />I was late to the party but enjoyed every second while there.  This book simply rocks, and rocks hard.  Flynn trots readers down a psychopath highway so full of twists, turns, twirls, and zig-zags that readers can't turn the pages quickly enough to find out what will happen next.  However, Flynn's writing is so top-notch, so flawless, that you are never ever forced off the road, never loose your place.  The story line is full but easy to follow.  The characters are so deep, so fleshed-out, so real, they actually do jump off the pages and into your mind and soul.<br /><br />From the first word to the last, this book is off and running -- hard.  Nick and Amy Dunne's life is put on full display, full of lies, deceit, hate, love, half-truths.  They've relocated to Missouri to help tend to Nick's ill parents. Nick is a handsome, down-to-earth guy, an all American boy.  Amy is a rich, pampered, spoiled daughter and wife.  Her parents made their fortune writing a children's series based on Amy and her life.<br /><br />Ah, Amy's life -- her life is never what you think it is, her life is never what you thought it was, her life is totally and completely her OWN, changed to fit her needs and desires.  Amy is one slick chick and when she comes up missing and Nick is the prime suspect the situation goes from bad to worse, from worse to bad, back and forth  As the reader, you NEVER know where this book is headed or what direction it is going to take.  It is so full of surprises and shocking situations you will find yourself literally sitting on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This book reminded me of a chilling Hitchcock type movie, so full of suspense and thunderbolt-type sensations.  Expect the unexpected, and then when those events occur, you will still be completely caught unawares.  When I wasn't reading this book, I could not stop thinking about it.<br /><br />I will say the ending left me feeling a little flat, and I see that is a general consensus.  However, do not let that stop you from reading this book.  It is just THAT good.<br /><br />For me, this is one of my favorite books of all times. If you only read one book this year, make it GONE GIRL.  You won't be sorry and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />PamHowever, do not let that stop you from reading this book.

0679805273|5|Classic! Purchased these to have my child's teachers sign them each year.
B00BVYNSLC|4|I'll preface this with the fact that I didn't have high expectations.  For whatever reason, I didn't expect this series to be very good.  I was pleasantly surprised though to find this series to be very enjoyable.  While not on par with some of the shows in my TV pantheon like Deadwood, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Sherlock, etc...  I did find that it kept my interest and had a good story arc.  I haven't seen season 2 yet, so I can't speak to how the story continues but I did find season 1 well worth my time.<br /><br />The lead actress, Tatiana Maslany, works her ass off in this series.  She displays a very wide range and I find her onscreen presence is a complex mix of toughness and vulnerability that is very lacking from many lead female characters.  While there are occasional stints of formulaic lazy TV writing and small plot holes, there is nothing unforgivable and on the whole it is some very good character writing that keeps you vested in the characters and the series.<br /><br />Give it a watch and you won't regret it.
B00XWUOG64|5|Good character development, lots of action, good plot twists
B00GINENG0|5|As a cat lover, I found this very funny & enjoyable. My friend & I were watching it & got a lot of laughs
B0058UXHHK|5|I loved loved loved this mystery! It had so many twist and turns, and who did this, and who said that. It was so awesome! It was nice to read a mystery book that you truly had no idea what was happening! It was very well written! There are more in the series, I can't wait to read those too!
B001BR5F4C|5|Both of these are outstanding. Quentin Teritino makes fantastic movies. I love all the old school blood and guts fighting. Recommended.
B00CWY76CC|4|great game. needs more rooms though. I love a game that u need paper and a pen to finish.  works great on kindle fire
0804161380|5|Very enjoyable set. It really is a must have for The Legend of Zelda fans.
B004JN1CW4|3|Read it pretty fast but wasn't fully committed to any of the characters. Too much running overall. Always with the running
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is amazing because it has the strategy and the thinking that you need to think about. It also has the rules of the road,sort of.
B0000UN25A|5|The Ultimate Collection 1968-2003 CD is great and arrived fast. The product was just as described. I' am very happy with this transaction.

B00005B1EX|5|\\"Live insurrection\\" is the first solo live album from the Metal God Rob Halford originally released in 2001. Recorded during the \\"Resurrection\\" world tour 2000-2001 in support of Halford's debut album, \\"Live...\\" is a complete 2CD/27track live album capturing songs throughout the singer's career; most of the tracks of the \\"Resurrection\\" debut are featured live on this release plus highlights of Halford's 90's group \\"Fight\\" and of course a long list of \\"Judas Priest\\" classics. Closing the package are reworked studio versions of \\"Heart of a lion\\" and \\"Prisoner of your eyes\\" plus a new-at the time-studio track \\"Screaming in the dark\\".<br /><br />The line up on this live album is the same that cut \\"Resurrection\\" in the studio, featuring US guitar hero `Metal'-Mike Chlasciak, drummer extraordinaire Bobby Jarzombeck, guitarist Patrick Lachman and bassist Ray Riendeau. The band's performance is indeed amazing going through Halford's 30 year music catalogue with incredible precision and fluency. All riffs, melodies, solos and drum patents are faithfully recreated on these recordings while Rob's vocal performance is outstanding hitting all notes with accuracy and sustain.<br /><br />Some of the performances as well as cover photos of this album seem to be taken from `Halford's show at the `Rock in Rio 2001' festival. Still this live album is not the audio equivalent of the \\"Halford-Rock in Rio\\" DVD released three years ago as \\"Live insurrection\\" features a more extensive track-list and considerably different performances of the songs. Overall \\"Live insurrection\\" is amongst the greatest heavy metal live albums released in the new millennium and it is still a thrilling listen, ten years past its release.
B001GAPC1K|5|I really liked this movie in theaters and wanted to get it on DVD, but now I could get it in blue ray which is even better! The quality is great and I thought the cover was very neat. It's a good movie to get for your home entertainment. :]
B00395ZYVS|5|Fantastic book!  I loved the characters and didn't want the story to end.  This book is impossible to put down.
B001RMYWG8|4|Well told story and well acted too. Really gives you a feel of what late 60's early 70's NYC police life was like. Wish they made more like this.
B001CIPU3G|5|I really disliked The Crusade. Everytime I listen to it it makes me sad. It had great music, great vocals all ruined by annoying lyrics and way too much melodic singing. Shogun is almost as good as Ascendancy. I enjoyed every track. Buy it!

B0006L16N8|1|All the flap over this overrated band demonstrates the sad sorry state of music today. This extremely derivative band throws in a dash of this and a dollop of that and everyone goes gah gah.  Geez.  I found this lp extremely pedestrian and homogenized.  If you like your music cream puff then you will dig this. Music for cream puffs. yep. that about sums it up.
0790736233|5|It's exhilarating to watch a film like Contact.  It's a awe-inspiring, excitingly told tale of a woman and her dreams to discover life beyond Earth.  After a beautiful opening shot, the film unfolds slowly but with great care.  This is one of those sci-fi films I watch on a regular basis, like the vastly underrated Mission to Mars, as they both involve the discovery of something beyond belief.<br />With all the previews and commericals, it's obvious Jodie Foster's character, Ellie Arroway, will make the trip around the galaxy in the spacecraft.  This really doesn't happen until about 110 minutes into the film (it runs at approximately 150 minutes), yet it never, not even for a second, tested my patience.  Everything leading up to that moment was perfect, all the way from the intriguing and original plot (for once, we should go to the aliens, not the other way around), the great acting and character development, and the breathtaking visuals, particularly in the final half hour.<br />Contact is pure magic; it's the kind of film one always hopes for:  an intelligent, thought-provoking, and still feel good film.  Definitely a must see to anybody with even a casual interest in this genre.
0446677450|4|All, <br />  I am not a millionaire, but I plan on being one.  I know I do not know enough right now, but I do know that I need fresh ideas on how to achieve this goal.  This book was my first exposure to \\"learning\\" about the mind set of a successful investor. <br />  That being said, this book is not your \\"instruction manual\\" on how to become an overnight success.  It is designed as part of an evolution in thinking, developing the millionaire mind set. <br />  In order to benefit from this book I found that I needed to be willing to put my beliefs in my pocket and maintain an open mind towards Mr. Kiyosaki's ideas and presentation.  His delivery is not earth shattering in its content, rather it moves you in subtle ways, providing a fresh perspective on society and its engrained habits, thereby suggesting how you can modify yours. <br />  Overall I would say that this book is an interseting read and a beneficial first step in modifying your estabished spending and working habits; towards your becoming a financial success and independently wealthy.
B006OCM0G0|5|I've managed to get myself hooked on all of these games.  Fun trying to juggle all of them at once.
B00846REIS|5|I loved this book more than 50 Shades of Gray. I thought the story was written exceptionally well, and the love scenes we HOT HOT HOT. If you liked 50 Shades you will deffinately like this too. I can not wait for the second one to come out.
B005LAIH3G|5|I love this movie. Great movie for the 3d TV. I really don't know why it didn't do better at the movies. Great action! It is lots of fun to watch.
B0012PDVQ2|5|I needed to see this movie for a film class I am attending. I literally can't believe I have never seen this movie. Blade Runner is an amazing movie. Remember it was released in 1982 so the view of the future is different but that's part of the beauty in the story. The last 15 minutes will change your life. Maybe not literally but possibly yes. Watch this movie, it's worth your time.
B00008MJ8H|5|Excellent movie & a genius soundtrack!  Ennio Morricone is brilliant!
B00005ATZT|5|One of the best remakes of an old movie/tv show i've ever seen.  Great action and terrific acting by some of Hollywood's finest (i.e. Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones).  A great movie that will keep you on edge til the end!
B009HEJXFS|5|I didn't have very high expectations when I rented it, but it was actually really entertaining. 5 star on the entertainment scale.
B008FYZIVY|5|I know why everyone is watching and loves Downton Abbey!  The characters are awesome!<br />I watched seasons 1 & 2 in one week so I could start with Season 3  this season.  Highly recommended!
B007IXWKUK|5|There's nothing like reading a story that keeps you up mindlessly all night reading. This trilogy has me wrapped around its kinky, loving and strange little finger. So so bad, so so wrong, yet all too good.
B005IQ39AY|3|Fun and addictive. To be terrific this game needs to be fine tuned by manufacturer.<br />Could use indepth playing info,  explanation of special balls  abilities and better<br />screen contrast.
B001MSMULG|5|Informative and fast-paced with many unexpected twists to the story; this was addictive, even for someone not conversant in the cultures of the Middle East.  While I like the main character because he is more than one dimensional.  I feel his protagonist could have been fleshed out a bit more.  I learned to dislike Shamron intensely and expect his misdirection is most likely a theme in the Gabriel Allon series.  I'm on to the next Daniel Silva book and hope I enjoy it as much as I did this one.
B00NM7IR26|5|This moving was F-ing awesome. It's everything that I wanted from a Godzilla movie when I started watching the old Toho ones like 15 years ago. This is a movie FOR people who love Godzilla, NOT for film snobs or people who take movies too seriously. As a movie I give it a B, but as a &#34;Monster Movie&#34; i give this a solid A+++++++++++++++++++++++. Loved it!<br /><br />P.S. to the morons who say it is too dark, turn up the brightness/contrast on your monitors, it's not that hard!
B00000JCB2|3|I'll admit, I started out hating Limp Bizkit. It seemed like they were &quot;lucky&quot; to catch the current rap-metal trend (which is something I'll stand by, because it DID help them a lot), and they had no talent. And  when I listened to this CD, I was looking forward to being able to say I'd  heard it, and it was TRULY horrible. However, they actually DO have some  good songs; the (real) opener &quot;Just Like This&quot;,  &quot;Rearranged&quot; and even &quot;Nookie&quot; (as stupid as it is,  lyrically, it IS catchy). A few on here, like &quot;Break Stuff&quot; and  all the interlude tracks, I still hate, but I've got to give the guys  credit for doing something decent. It didn't 'rock my world', but it didn't  make me shut it off in disgust, and I was interested enough to finish most  of the album.
B00FEMJF6O|5|Lots of fun. Good way to kill time. I like that I don't have to feel compelled to rush to meat goals.
B0007ZEBI0|5|I have listened to it many times Its very tough to turn this album off in the middle.  Nice storyline great emotions set up by the music.  Arriving Somewhere But Not Here is a great progressive song as the instrumental portion of the song really gives you the feeling that the main character is going faster and faster back into time were fate went astray on him. Shallow is the song that gets the airplay but Halo is really the track that blows me away and is alone worth the price of admission as the production values of that song live are great.
B00005JKJA|1|If you ever want to feel like you're on a bad acid trip just rent this movie. The beginning seemed to have potential but totally fell apart by the end. Lynch couldn't pull off a somewhat satisfactory ending after two and half hours. Hang it up until you can put out something good ol'Davey, please!
B0091VX01K|5|This is Alex Proyas' best film. A sci-fi that it beautifully rendered with fantastic story, set design, music, and cinematography.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Awesome book. If you read &#34;a Time To Kill&#34; and enjoyed it, you will be doing yourself a favor by reading this one.
B003KTMW9K|5|It's a pretty entertaining game, after several hours the only problem is the beginning of... There's a kind of inattention in this prologue for those who doesn't read the books yet and doesn't know the world of Geralt...
B004X80QNG|5|I used Pocket Informant on my itouch and loved it, but when I switched to an android smartphone, I couldn't find a calendar/productivity app that was comparable.  Even PI for Android didn't impress me at the time, and Google Calendar was just too simple.  PI is discounted now through Amazon, and so I gave it a go.  I really like the interface.  Also, it's important for me to be able to tweak the colors and settings, and PI allows me to customize all I want.
B0064X7FVE|1|I depend on weather forecasts for my work outdoors. After monitoring TWC every 5 minutes this past friday....i was assured there was no wet weather coming up.<br />With zero notice we were DILUGED by a storm that LIT UP your competitor's radar. This weather cost me hundreds of dollars of ruined gear. I will never leave forecasting the weather to you  ever again.
B00HZ0SC4E|1|Video quality was poor; slow load; the video would skip without moving the track.  There was nothing wrong with my internet.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Witty and entertaining series.  You will find yourself invested in these characters.
B006ICGH56|5|There is no dozing during this great movie.  A lot of action, yet not loaded with &#34;special effects&#34;.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B00QLVY7J2|1|Requires you to buy point after first level.
0486284735|1|Print much too small for me.
B009SH5JS4|5|One of my all time top 10 favorite movies and I think my favorite Meg Ryan movie.
1565847032|5|He is a great guy, should run the world. This is a must read for anyone who thinks at all. Very readable
B004KPX5GC|5|the ease  of use and production quality makes this a first rate value - i have used this service before and I will again
B000002JSN|5|I was first introduced to Led Zep formally by chance. I was frequenting the local music store looking, praying for music with some any type of substance and inspiration after being subjected to our currently abysmal rock scene. Lo and behold, I come across the \\"Early and Latter Years\\" compilation and decide to give these Zeppelin guys a try. Well, to say that they absolutely changed my life would be an understatement. Listening to those CD's showed me what REAL rock music, with complex, beautiful arrangements, lyrics, and vocals was all about. From that day forward, with each and every succeeding paycheck that I received from my crummy college job, I began to purchase the entire Zep catalogue. By the time I'd made it to Physical Graffiti, I'd already cemented Led as one of the BEST EVER. This album only further confirmed that opinion. \\"In My Time of Dying\\", \\"Kashmir\\", \\"In the Light\\", \\"Black Country Woman\\" just oozed supremacy. Jimmy Page is a frickin' mastermind. Robert Plant is a \\"Golden God\\". John Paul Jones and John Bonham are the PREMIER rhythm section rock has EVER produced. This album's beauty is the equivalent of Eva Longoria, Jessica Simpson, and every other hot chick you could think of-- all in one. (that was a dumb analogy, but I think you get my point) If you have this album, play it, and play it often. If you don't --- GO GET IT SILLY.
B00881VLCE|5|I love the many puzzles and choice of difficulty!
B00BAXFACO|5|Wonderful! Just like all of Connelly's other books. He just gets better and better!!! I can't wait until he writes his next one.
0446547654|2|The Notebook is my very favorite movie. I never read the book, but was hoping for the moving experience I felt from the Notebook.  Was very let down....$12.99 for another Danielle Steele type plot that was so predictable it was sad.  This author made money I am sure from his name, but I highly doubt this is a work he is proud of from a literary prospective.
B00JOT3HQ2|4|I love this game it is so fun and it is an addicting game I  could play it all day
0439023521|2|I may take some slack for this but I did not overly enjoy this book. I got bored with it to be honest and didn't really feel anything towards any of the characters. Katness annoyed me a lot of the time and I kind of got sick of hearing about how Peta didn't really love her etc.. I got the point the first 50 times she said it.<br />I felt the story was a good idea but I felt the only thing that was really well described was the food. Yeah, Hunger games I get that but I didn't feel like I was ever there with the characters.<br />I my read the last two I already have them but they aren't at the top of my list to read.
B000VSAEYI|5|This thing is so cool, mine even came with three inflatable toys and three rings that you can toss on the toys. Seriously, this would have been worth the money even if it only lasted the day. I have spent more money at the water park buying lunch! You cannot go wrong for $35. My two year old just loves this thing. She carries the sea creatures around and sends them down the slide, plays in the water streams, and goes down the slide herself. I was worried it would be a disappointment because of some of the reviews, but for now it has stayed inflated and water tight for almost a week. It is also great for lounging in on a hot night with a beer after your little ones go to sleep!
B009PLKCEE|5|This great player works really fast for me, but what is more important that it could easily play videos with embedded ac3 audio.
B00KFDO44A|5|Great Album!
B0031RSA24|5|This book has given many of my preexisting thoughts a scientific backing, whereas before some of my personal concepts about religion and god simply flowed from my loose knowledge of Darwinian concepts but mostly from my exasperation towards &#34;some&#34; attitudes, prejudices, irrational rules, meaningless ceremonies etc. etc. from otherwise decent people. This I direct at many people I have met and continue to meet that consider themselves believers and I have them down as lovely people regardless of our differences, and I sincerely hope they feel the same about me and my family. My message to them is that one does not choose to &#34;not&#34; believe in a god and there is no forcing it.<br />It has also opened my eyes to many new angles and subjects, firmly strengthening my already &#34;no proof-no fairy&#34; approach to all matters involving religion, blind-faith and not least to, sometimes embarrassing, evidently skewed views of very dubious proof in favor of an impossible.<br />Great read - Loved it !.
B000AM6OQ2|5|So they ran out of copies with the green cover, gee, lets change colors and hook potenial buyers in. What a crock of S###. This film is good, but not worthy of the trick treatment, Debra Hill is probably turning in her grave. Skip the remake, get the original copy,(green cover), and enjoy a good scare. Alot of buyers will see the new cover thinking all new disc, beware, these people are money hungry leaches. They can all burn there Saks 5th avenue suits with me lighting the torch.
B00000J2PH|3|Pleasant sound. She sounds folky and 70's at the sametime. Cd is on sale and  was interesting to listen to a few of her songs that I wasnt familiar w.
B007IXWL2C|5|A wonderful book totally captivating with unexpected twisting events throughout.<br />Unstoppable reading till the very end.<br />Highly recommended as one of the best trilogy drama books I have read.
B000HKW7E0|5|Fantastic Movie. One of my favorites.  Movies is as described and arrived when promised. Great service.
B0041KBWM0|5|This was a wonderful rendition. Enjoyed the character development and cast chemistry. Would recommend it to any Jane Austen fan.
B007Y36K46|5|If you are an ERB purist then this might not be the movie for you. That being said, I have probably read the original series in its entirety about as much as anyone and I do not mind what they did with the story here. Enjoy!
B0060FXDCG|5|I enjoyed these movies ans remeber the cartoons as a kid and enjoy watching them again and again when I can.
B008UCJ7KO|5|Can't wait for the next two books in the Crossfire series to be released!<br />I'm addicted to these books!<br />Thank you Sylvia Day
B001KL3GZO|5|This is the best version of this album. The remastering job and the extras are excellent.
B000000OAL|4|Everyone has to start somewhere. This album was the 3rd one I got for my  collection(I have all original 19 now...took me!) How did they get to be so creative? They totally made a new trail of the rock-band road when 'Queen' was released. Every song is unique. My fave song is The Night Comes Down. Freddie can certainly hit those high notes! If you have any sense in you, this album will do the trick for any devoted Queen fan addition.
B00NN5JUOG|5|It's super simple and useful. I can not live without this! If you haven't one of these keychains you should remedy it.<br /><br />AAAA +++++++
B008NW67E0|3|Okay.  Same sound as the first album.  Some songs okay, some not compelling.
B003YL4LYI|4|Good page turner.  I enjoy the series.  I was hoping that by the time I read this book that the final book would be out.
B00CXQL828|4|If you are looking for a different kind of band, you should buy this album. I decided to buy it because of the members of the band and I'm not dissapointed from the album. Very nice set of songs.
B008JFUPFI|2|I got it but it didn't have a two- disc special.
6304297912|5|A great movie, for entertainment,laughs, or a very attractive renton[Ewan Mcgregor]shines in this movie. A Favorite of mine!! I reccomend you Watch it!
0679805273|5|Excellent purchase as graduation gift!  A personal note on the front wishing them a safe journey to college or trade school or in persuing a career is the perfect finishing touch.  If you always give money to the grad, consider this book as an addition to the gift. Parents, it's a great idea for your own kids. As a former high school English teacher and mom, it was the standard gift for all the kids, and we still get thanks and smiles from young adults who loved the book!
0439023491|5|Catching Fire is a great second book. It keeps you thirsty for more and will keep it coming to the very end. Enjoy!
006202406X|5|This book is amazing and I definitely don't regret buying it. But be prepared to tears if you want to read the serie
0385484518|5|If you're looking for a good book to read, don't hesitate to buy this one. It's the type of book that makes an impact on you, and not just an impression. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.
B00KNWYDU8|5|It is very easy but also difficult and you need to be very patient.
B009FZHYKU|4|Love the WD! The second season was the best so far and its become a little less fun but it is still a great show!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Its simple to use. And convinient to use. Calculatotor is large. So no mistakes with pushing the wrong buttons.  It also remembers and shows you your last calculations.  Over all great and keep in mind your getting all this for free.
B004JN1CW4|4|The maze runner trilogy was awesome. It was a great read.  I found it exciting and I became part of the story with Thomas.
B003Y5HWJU|1|I look at the favourable reviews for this program and wonder how, or why, the reviewers have not noticed:  (a) that the script-writing is awful.  Where to begin?  The ridiculous liberties taken with history would be a start.  The implausible dialogue would be a close second.  Did nobody read the script aloud before they started filming?  Did nobody do any study of how people spoke at the time?  The two dimensional character development would be third. Characters cut from cardboard, stuck together with wall-paper paste.  (b) the acting is just bad.  It would be bad even for a soap opera.  \\"Wooden\\" is an appropriate adjective for much of it.  Then there are the ever-painful attempts by latter-day actors to mimick accents.  If you have no idea what an Irish accent sounds like, don't try to do an Irish accent.  If you don't have any idea what an Italian accent ought to sound like, don't do an Italian accent.  If you don't do Polish, or Yiddish, or German, then leave it alone.  (c)  the camera-work is bad in a way that is difficult to explain.  It is the kind of camera work that might be ok in an airplane safety video explaining how to buckle your lap belt, how to find the life vest, and how to proceed to the emergency exit.  That anybody can find work in TV drama with this kind of camera-work is a very sad comment about TV.  (d)  the \\"no-name brand\\" camera work may flow from the direction, which, not surprisingly, is awful.  There is nothing clever in this production.  Nothing.  It includes the same gratuitous violence, unrealistic, over-the-top, \\"violence-as-pornography\\" you would expect.  The direction can never, ever, leave the viewer to figure out anything by himself or herself.  Heaven forbid that any scene should have any (intentional) irony, or anything but the most obvious, leaden double-entendre.  That is why the camera is positioned and operated as if they are trying to make an instructional video, so that the viewer can't possibly misunderstand what the director is trying to get across.  It is why the dialogue is wrong: Always use contemporary 2011 dialogue, and, if in doubt, make it stilted, and throw in lots of 2011-style swearing, because there is a chance that if the script required dialogue from the 1920's, spoken as it might actually have been, the viewers wouldn't understand - they might need sub-titles, and the intended audience for this show isn't the kind that knows what to do with sub-titles.  Use every possible cliche or worn phrase, to make sure that every possible viewer, no matter how stupid, will understand them. The production seems to be driven by the principle: Why do anything subtle, when you can hit the viewer over the head with it ten times instead.  It is why the violence can't be just ordinary violence, it has to be cartoon violence, pornographic violence, with large quantities of blood splattered on everything in the scene - otherwise the audience might not understand that they really, really, really killed the man. Both the violence and the ridiculous sex are over-acted in the manner of slapstick comedy, or vaudeville, or silent films before talkies.  It's a cartoon caricature.  It is clumsy, ham-fisted, bull-in-a-china-shop, second or third-grade work.  When the three stooges did this kind of stuff, it was intended to be funny.  This production wasn't intended to be funny. It isn't.  It is just bad.  If there is one word that sums up the multitude of failings of this production it would be: \\"Artless\\".  The only things about this series that are reasonably well done?  Somebody has paid attention to costumes, furniture, and vintage cars; somebody else knew a fair bit about music.
B005GFPZYK|5|eye opener... this book was read after his death and really made his tragic death much more painful...  The book gave me a great respect for those that serve and have served.  RIP .. Chris Kyle
0316044695|5|Superb read, set in Afganistan.  Highly recommend this book!
B001TCHDPS|5|Was well produced album and well mixed. Production quality really, really high. Bought after renting the South African documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;.
B0080SW3CC|5|came quickly, as described.  Thanks.
B000057DON|5|A+++
B000UAE7RW|5|It was the first of three movies. &#34;The Two Jakes&#34; followed, but the third movie was never made.
B00E8KLWB4|3|I like the game, directions could be better. I don't like being pestered to rate the game tho...
B00DUGCLY4|5|This came is cool, and not that challenging. Well download it... you will enjoy it. Hurry hurry hurry, before  it too late.
B0049P1VHS|4|couldn't find the b&w as it said in the description. I am addicted to the series so I love having this dvd. I forgot that the first season was so short.
B0054JZC6E|4|This game is a good eye and hand coordination game. My children and I have contests to see who can get a better score.
B006FE17Q6|5|Season 1 left me wanting more and season 2 has delivered it. As far as the romance goes with Glenn and Maggie, that's fine. It builds their relationship, and what could be brewing between Carol and Daryl. I find that interesting. The fact that Rick wanted Hershel to allow them to stay is because he is afraid for Lori b/c she's pregnant, and Carl. Yes, it's only been a few weeks since he found them, but who wouldn't see Hershel's farm as a safe haven for awhile. There are no walkers, there's food, fresh water, and a house for protection. Except of course for the walkers in the barn. Episode 7 gave it a heart wrenching twist, so I am drooling for the second part of season 2. Shane, even though quite the jerk to some people, tends to save the day. He has survival at all cost in his mind, as would I if I were in that situation. His character is everything Rick's character is not. which I'm inclined to say is going to get him killed eventually(foresight there nothing more). Bronze and muscle is great when dealing with the dead, but not with the living. with all his faults, however, he is my faviorite characters apart from Daryl. I would recommend to anyone to read the comics. They are just as great as the show, and believe it or not, Lori's pregnancy has alot to do with how the writers do the next few seasons/episodes. (Hopefully there will be quite a few.) All in all, I'm hooked on the Walking Dead. One of the best tv series in along time.
B0064MPXFA|4|I just took a look at it and I like it it go with the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence but once you get there you find out you was better off on the other side great show
0345803485|5|this was really racy for my tastes but it was still a good book. it read smoothly, and can not wait to read the next one.
0140120416|5|Trying to teach the husband Russian and he likes that there are English translations in this one.
B003P9VZ0W|5|I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughters room.  It was very easy to apply to the bedroom wall.  I even rearranged the position of the decals several times and had no problem with removing them and they stayed on the wall without peeling off.  There are so many ways you can arrange the grouping.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to add a picture to their wall without harming the paint.
B0058VW36U|5|This game is highly addictive and SO much fun! The graphics are great,the levels are challenging and Om Nom is freaking adorable. It would probably be my favorite game if I hadn't found &quot;Where's My Water&quot; first. Swampy is #1 on my list, but this one is a CLOSE second. Hours of fun- great way to pass time. Good for adults and children.
B004GYY714|5|Love this app
B00MBVLA50|5|As always with Frazey Ford, spot on!
B008AK8FHM|5|This book will lessen any fear you may have of death.  Beautifully written by a famed Neurosurgeon....this is one near death experience that you will find very hard to question.  Miracles do indeed happen!!!
B007J4T2G8|1|With all the hype for this book I was expecting an interesting read.  Well not so much!  The book is not well written, so much so that it took longer than necessary to get through it.  If you're reading it for the sex, again not so much.  There is one decent section but after that it falls down fast.
B00HHYF5FC|5|Great series.  I have a few left to watch, but I love the ones that I have already watched.
B005BRS8Z6|5|This book is great because it`s simple and practical. I found myself already applying what I have learned. I am looking forward to taking the time to apply these lessons to paper and begin to sort myself out. I am motivated to be a better version of myself! Namaste and be well!
B00P42WROG|5|A continuation of &#34;Mr. Mercedes&#34;, but only because it has the same characters. Completely different plot line. And Stephen King, as always, delivers the characters right to your door. By the end of the book, these are no longer characters in a book but are friends that you are reluctant to say goodbye too. Like most of Stephen King's books, I found myself rationing the &#34;read&#34; in order to prolong the book, but to no avail... His books are like an ice cream cone... once you start, you HAVE to finish and all too often, you get to the crunchy cone goodness way too soon...<br />Highly recommended...
B00DR0PDNE|5|Gives our family real freedom in our viewing choices. We don't have the expense of paying for shows that we don't use.
B0013DC9XE|5|Very Nice collection. Complete. My 7 yo son loves it. Has it on his mp3. John Williams is a masterful composer!
B004W4N55C|3|Can it have a better interface? Lats with UI, reliability and content too less
B0099RFVXQ|5|Can't wait for the next one.
B00B2QG3K2|5|It's Paramore. What else comes to mind quicker than the word &#34;a-m-a-z-i-n-g.&#34; I accidently left my cd behind in a friend's car driving on the way to see them live perform and was so unwilling to be without it that the same night I hastily ordered another copy. This band frankly, rocks.
B000YIGNKE|1|I was so disappointed in this version.  The only person to whom I would recommend this movie  is someone who has never actually read Persuasion or seen one of the purer movie adaptations.  The movie is not without merit,  but the scenes that are familiar seem to be recycle from earlier versions.  Of that scenes that are not familiar, half are not even representative of the book.  Apparently, the screen writers felt they were more capable of delivering Jane Austen's vision than she was.  I could have forgiven the small disappointments throughout the movie if the end hadn't been varied beyond recognition.  The fairy tale moment that we expect (Austen fans will know to what I refer) is so grotesquely distorted that it completely alters the character of Anne and makes her laughable instead of the heroine.  The ending is absolutely slaughtered.  If you love Persuasion DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!
B00DA6YEKS|4|I really like this book. Mr. Sanderson is doing a good job of maintaining the pace of the book while keeping the world engrossing. There is a fine line authors read in epic fantasy, and Brandon is doing it well. I look forward to the next book in the series.
B00EVN3JNM|5|I wish all movies were so entertaining.
B00IMZ2PNK|4|Usually the second isn't done as well as the first.  That is not the case here.  I am happy to see improved writing and plot development.
B004TI5N38|5|It was a great book.  The characters were interesting and believable.  The settings were described in such a way that I could picture them in my mind.
B000QCS8TW|4|After watching the first season of HBO's take on this book, I sat down and read the entire series and loved it. Though the introduction of new characters later in the series forced me to stop to try to remember who these characters were, it added to the complexity of the story. I also love that the author is not afraid to kill off main characters - very realistic though sometimes regrettable. I also love that it is a long series - so much to enjoy!
B004GUSG4M|5|It was so suspenseful.  I didn't want to stop reading.  I haven't read anything this engaging for quite a while.
B00GUJP9PG|5|Fun game for all ages...
B005GVA2L0|4|It took me a while to get into this  CD but when it finally clicked I was pleasantly surprised.  The only two songs that should not be on this CD are, \\"Sick of it all\\", and \\"Lost in Paradise.\\"  This is a CD well worth waiting for.
B001UV4XIS|5|The decade journey closes ( longer for those of us on board with the release of the Philosopher's Stone ). Yates , WB and the cast have done a fine job ( w/ both parts), changes from the books made were less painful than earlier film cuts, although the occasional monologuing of exposition occurs, like Harry explaining wand lore and who the elder wand belongs to... May they didn't do enough of this, even, I thought Harry's on-screen Horcrux Math was lacking, if I hadn't read the material I questioned how it was condensed here. Harry actually says \\" there's one Horcrux left ... I hope the less literate members of the audience could keep up with these potentially confusing leaps.  That complaint aside...The scenes in this story were ready made for cinema ... Breaking into and out of the Gringott's wizard bank, which even on screen is established as the most secure place in the very first adventure. Other homages to the decade of Potter history are made ofcourse... Basilisk anyone? Again I say the cast has done a super job in making us care about these characters , good and evil for what amounts to a 16 hour experience ... Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are over the top as expected, but subtile performances are in the mix like, Dame Maggie Smith's at times elegant Prof. McGonagall portrayal, briefly many other Hogwarts cameos ( surprising how many students are still onboard from Year One). As for Harry, Ron and Hermione, they may have delivered their best work to date, but they are so comfortable with each other as with the characters that is seems pretty effortless ... Although I wonder if even they can make the distinction at this point .... Mischief Managed, y'all .
B00005BKZJ|5|A zaftig German tourist has a major tiff with her boorish husband in the middle of the desert outside Las Vegas, yanks a suitcase out of the car and stomps off for points unknown. Her husband, perhaps to make a point, drives off without looking back.<br /><br />Several hours later, the wife (Marianne Sagebrecht) arrives dusty and dishevelled at the only populated spot on the horizon, the run-down, lethargic Bagdad Oil and Gas and Cafe, run by a cranky woman named Brenda(the incomparable CCH Pounder). Brenda has just driven her husband away with her hystrionics, but her disposition seems earned; she is riding herd on a failing business, assisted only by a less-than-inspired cook, while trying to keep track of a free-spirit teenage daughter who cavalierly rides off with motorcyclists and truck drivers for days at a time. Brenda also is plagued by a son whose only interest in life is playing etudes and fugues on the piano; there is also the matter of his infant son, who is never explained (Brenda's son seems far too young to be responsible for an infant, but there it is, and no mother in sight). It all makes Brenda more than a little cranky. And when a strange, foreign lady in odd clothing appears at the door wanting a room at the adjoining motel, her patience is sorely tried.<br /><br />The German tourist, Jasmin, comes to the Cafe because it is the only thing in sight. She asks for a room in the motel, while musing privately about the state of uncleanliness throughout the business, and views the other denizens of the motel with a guarded eye. Rudi Coxx (Jack Palance, in a stellar turn), an ex-set painter from Hollywood, dresses outlandishly and lives, apparently, in a small travel trailer on the property. Debby, who lives in the motel, carries on a highly successful ad hoc tattoo business; truck drivers literally launch themselves from their rigs and race to her room. (You might get the wrong idea of the nature of her work from their initial enthusiasm, but her calling is made clear very early on.)<br /><br />Jasmin quietly makes herself indispensible to Brenda, after Brenda's initial suspicions; she is won over by Jasmin's gentle nature and willingness to aid Brenda in whatever way necessary. Jasmin wins the hearts of Brenda's teenage children also, and she quickly becomes part of the oddball family of misfits.<br /><br />This movie is an unqualified joy. Nothing momentous happens here, unless you count Jasmin's unifying of the oddities into a working unit; it is simply a sweet, surreal two hours in which to lose oneself. All the acting is first-rate; Marianne Sagebrecht made a few appearances in American movies, probably on the strength of her role here, and does a fine job as the sweet but determined Jasmin. Jack Palance performs so admirably that he should have been nominated for Best Supporting, although the role was a blip on the radar amongst the big-budget movies of that year. And CCH Pounder transforms wonderfully from the frenetic, wired, bad-tempered harridan of the first fifteen minutes of the movie to the accepting and content cafe manager of later in the film.<br /><br />I saw this movie a few years after it came out, and was instantly hooked. At some point I hope they come down a bit on the price, but at least it's finally in DVD; for a long time I could not find it in that format. It is well deserving of being on the shelf of any serious film buff; a gentle, honest treatment of the power of positive tninking and good will. Highly recommended.very early on.)

B008BQ8YHQ|5|Intelligent writing that makes you want more and don't want to stop watching.  look forward to the next season going to prime.
B007J4T2G8|5|Loved it!! It had a little bit everything the ending is soo worth reading the whole book I was actually sad whem I finished it bit super excited for the second one. Its a must read and I would def read it again!
B00HXYKYIE|5|While this is a work of fiction, it intricately weaves many true elephant stories from well-known researchers. I saw these stories play out repeatedly in the book as I'd read many of the books the author cites at the end. This is a wonderful read and serves as an excellent education on elephants.  I've spent time volunteering on wildlife reserves in Africa and have seen the wonder of elephants in person.  Simply amazing.<br /><br />The story that is told in this book is gripping and I found it difficult to put down.  I won't give away that ending, but what a great and unexpected end to a wonderfully written book.  This is truly a must read.
B00HDMMISA|5|This was a story about the repercussions and life changing events that happen because of of one person's callous lie affect on so many individuals whose lives unknowingly are touched in some way. The story kept me fascinated and interested to the very end.  It was gripping and intense and so utterly easily possible to happen in today's busy world where families and friends don't take the time to REALLY see or admit what's going on right under their noses.  Great great story.  This is the second book of Liane's I've read and now I'm a committed fan.
B00H71PBQ8|5|I just love this show!!! I have been waiting for it to be released because I missed the original airing in January.  Once I start watching I cannot stop.  Kudos to everyone involved in this wonderful show.  I highly recommend it!  Excellent acting and beautiful surroundings.  I so hope they keep making new ones!  Thank you Amazon for having this available for us.
B003V5PQ1E|5|I absolutely love this cd! But, just a warning: It's addicting. You won't wanna stop listening. This cd actually only has about 9 real, full-length songs. The other tracks are just quotes or short musical interludes, both of which, I could do without. But the full songs are awesome! This album is certainly different than all the previous Linkin Park cd's but still worth buying. I would suggest listening to it for what it is and the cool music on this cd, not for the fact that it is Linkin Park. If you buy it expecting to hear typical Linkin Park...you'll be disappointed. But it's still good music, Linkin Park or not, and is still worth listening to. As long as you expect it to be different...you'll like it! I would definitely reccommend this to a friedn! Enjoy!
B00IOVH8AW|5|Appropriate name to a fun song.  You feel happy when you hear it and you want to dance, even if you can't
B004JMZPJG|4|It was as described, a little awkward in the bottom part of the case. The side pocket is helpful as well. I would recommend this product to every DSLR beginner users, it's good from travelling especially if you want more space on your bag.
B000063DIH|5|this is one of the best Iron Maiden cds i own at the moment. From Here to Eternity is an amazing song that makes you wanna like go straight to hell and shake Eddies hand. Be Quick or be Dead is a classic song and i also highly recommend hearing it live. The Apparation is a great song with interesting lyrics and this crazy guitar solo in the middle. and of course Fear of the Dark is one of the best songs ever in the whole world. without a doubt. SO GO BUY IT NOW!!!! UP THE IRONS!!!!!!! <br />                                    -----thompson

B000003N8R|5|Having heard \\"Interstellar Space\\" (1967) and \\"Sun Ship\\" (1965) prior to this 1964 album, I was surprised by how down to earth it was. The same goes for the comparison of this with \\"Kulu Se Mama\\" (1965) and \\"Meditations\\" (1966), where two drummers and several percussionists are used at once, and a bigger band gives free improvisation, which in the opinion of many \\"standard jazz lovers\\", sounds chaotic. The classic Coltrane quartet took a dramatic turn (not necessarily for the worse) after \\"A Love Supreme\\" (1965), where a sign of change was already presented.<br />This album gives a side and sound of Coltrane that I don't think can be heard anywhere else - it's a deep and melancholy, yet sweet album with clear sound and excellent stereophony.<br />Between the first 18 and the last 19 minutes of the album is the short and up-lifting up-tempo \\"Bessie's Blues\\", which, with its outstanding \\"persona\\", lifts the album at the right point, and is the reason why this album is complete. The rest of the tunes are performed at 112 bpm and below. \\"Wise One\\" and \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" (both with long rubato introductions and endings) feature some of the most touching piano work I've heard by McCoy Tyner. Jimmy Garrison gives a three-plus minute unaccompanied bass-solo in \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" which adds a chapter in a flavour of its own to the song. \\"The Drum Thing\\" is also something new; a straight-eight tune, predominated by drums and a rhythmic one-note bass line, with a mesmerizing tenor melody (Coltrane doesn't play soprano sax on this album). The rhythm-section's unique co-operation and the sound of Trane's horn are here captured at their best. If you like Coltrane's music in any way, do not leave \\"Crescent\\" out of your collection!
B000KX0IOA|5|This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. The movie tells the story of the life of Mohandas K Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi).<br />It is a movie I think everyone should see. Gandhi was incredible, a truly incredible person.<br /><br />When he died, a poor old man, without possessions, public office or formal position, he was mourned by the whole world, royalty from the entire world were at his funeral.<br /><br />Albert Einstein said \\"Future generations will find it hard to believe that a man like this once walked among us\\".<br /><br />Gandhi changed the world in so many ways. He proved that pacifists could win wars; he brought the British Empire to its knees without ever lifting a hand against their enemy.<br /><br />He fought for freedom for his people but he would never compromise his principles to do it, he could have made India free sooner if he had let his people rise up, but he knew that doing so would create a nation of warriors and that in the long term it would never work. He wanted the British to leave as friends, which they finally did.<br /><br />The Young Gandhi<br />His fame started in South Africa, he was a lawyer, had studied at oxford and expected to be treated as an equal to the British, this was not the way in South Africa.<br /><br />Indians were looked down on by the British in South Africa and weren't even allowed to walk on the sidewalk with a white man. They also needed to be registered and at all time carry a passport, something Brits did not have to have.<br /><br />He started a crusade to make things more equal in South Africa and made incredible differences, he spent 20 years in South Africa before returning to India.<br /><br />India<br />In India he was the one that started the non-violence motion of independence that freed India.<br />He was so loved by the people that when fights started breaking out and the people stopped following his teachings of non-violence; he fasted, until they stopped. He almost died, but everyone in India stopped fighting and begged him to start eating.<br /><br />I apologize for not being able to make him justice in this short text but I hope you can see how much admiration I have for Gandhi.<br /><br />The movie tells an incredible story about him and I think you should see it.<br />To add, the movie one won 8 Oscars, among others Ben Kinsley one an Oscar for his portrayal of Gandhi, which was incredible.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie yet, you have to!<br />It will quite possibly change your life.him justice in this short text but I hope you can see how much admiration I have for Gandhi.  The movie tells an incredible story about him and I think you should see it.

B008DM4OTA|5|I have a 3 yr. old cousin who wanted to play on my kindle fire. I scrolled through my apps for a good app for people her age to play. I was happy when I saw I hadn't deleted it yet. I let her play it. Whenever she healed an animal,  she would say all better! She loved healing the patients. I reccommend.
081298160X|5|I've just started the book, and so the far I am HOOKED!!  Now I just need to apply 'ACTION&#34; once I gain an understanding of the &#34;How&#34;, and this may be a self-help book that I can apply to reality, and have SOME, ANY IMPACT!

B00G4I1CLS|5|Excellent Documentary.  Explains how Killer Whales are exploited and used to make money while forced to live in an abnormal life in a far too small environment.  Exposes big businesses for the mental and physical damage they are causing these magnificent whales, while selfish money making people try to sweep these facts under the view of the public.
B003O86FMW|5|The sequel surpasses the original!  Can't wait to read the next book. You really feel connected to the characters and are invested in their story. Couldn't put this book down.
B00AYE8C70|5|Good
0743270754|4|Goodwin's much-praised, massive \\"multiple quasi-biography\\" of Abraham Lincoln and the contentious men who composed his Civil War-time Cabinet proved to be worth my wait - though not without its share of flaws.  Lincoln is the clear hero of the tale, the oft-\\"mis-underestimated\\" man whose rivals for the 1860 Republican Presidential nomination - William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates - regarded him with a mixture of condescension and exasperation.  The \\"Illinois country lawyer\\" proved to have an unsurpassed ability to take such individuals into his administration and keep their disagreements from erupting into internecine warfare that might have seriously damaged the cause of the Union during the war.  Goodwin may slightly overstate the \\"Lincoln magic\\" at times in her desire to portray the man's \\"political genius\\", but Lincoln's ability to pour oil on troubled waters truly was remarkable and is a model of Presidential leadership.  Goodwin paints on such a broad canvas and includes so many different events and individuals that it should probably not be surprising that her narrative contains a few loose threads and gaps.  Remarkably, her discussion of the Lincoln-Douglas debates says nothing about the Freeport Doctrine and its role as a point of contention between the candidates.  Characters such as General Winfield Scott and Count Adam Gurowski are mentioned numerous times but are never \\"formally\\" introduced to the reader.  The opening 200 or so pages also drag a bit, as Goodwin meticulously traces the lives of the \\"rivals\\" from the beginning.  Those searching for the \\"red meat\\" of political infighting and Cabinet squabbles will have a long wait in store for them if they begin at the beginning.  Overall, though, this is a fine read and a good contribution to the vast literature on the Civil War era.
0684853523|5|For the legions of Stephen King fans out there (which is to say a lot), the first third of the book containing his short memoir is truly a gift.  One can't help wanting to read about his/her favorite writer after being transported to fantastic worlds countless times in Mr. King's prolific career.  Some fans would have paid... gladly for the first 101 pages of the memoir (&quot;C.V.&quot; he calls it), which includes heartfelt tidbits about his brother, mother and his long battles with alcohol and drug addiction.<br />The second part, &quot;On Writing,&quot; is where the aspiring novelists will find inspiration.  Assuming you're a serious writer (or wanting to be a published one), you'd no doubt would have read the countless manuals on the mechanics of writing.  With Mr. King, you do get short lessons in the mechanics of prose here and there.  What he mostly offers to the aspiring writer is the inspiration, the cheerleading, and as some have already suggested, after reading it makes you want to sit and write something.  He actually allows you into his writing routine, when and where he writes, how many months it takes to write the first draft, and even how he goes about editing the second draft.<br />Some very original thoughts I found quite interesting:<br />1. Story is a fossil you find on the ground, and you gradually dig it out slowly.<br />2. He doesn't plot his stories.  He puts &quot;a group of characters in some sort of predicament and then watch them try to work themselves free.&quot;  In fact he even goes as far as to say, &quot;plot is shift, and best kept under house arrest.&quot;<br />3. Write first draft with the &quot;door&quot; closed, and the second draft with it open.<br />There are truly gems here for writers, simple, direct, to the point.  As always, he doesn't talk down to you.  There is even advice on finding agents.<br />The final section elaborates his near-death experience in summer of 1999, when he was hit by a van driven by Bryan Smith.  The book is actually a sandwich: two slices of autobigraphy with the writing advice as the meat of the book.<br />Though the thin volume was not your edge-of-the-seat thriller or horror, I found myself reading the darn thing in one seating.  A pretty good deal for a non-fiction book.  This may sound funny, too, but I felt like the book became a good friend of mine.  In a word, this is book is intimate.  As a fan, and perhaps a writer, that might be worth something.
B00UC9EXKW|5|Very sick
B00003CY3W|5|I enjoyed this film a great deal.  The characters were well conceived, and the actors gave them a real depth.  Parts were exceptionally poignant, and other moments were riotously funny.  The momentum of the plot reminded me of a Greek tragedy...(...).
B000FC2L1Y|4|These books are not &#34;great literature&#34; but they are fun reads, if a bit long.
B00459EZLW|5|Great show - wish they'd make the movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5|I just felt compelled to keep reading. I was breathed into the world of PANEM. I wish there were five more.
B00004VXF2|2|I was actually one of the suckers who bought this on LP way back in the day. I was really upset that Lou thought so little of his fans that he would take such cynical advantage of them, and didn't own another Lou Reed album until the brilliant \\"Magic and Loss\\" and \\"New York\\" CD's decades later. It angered me that much.<br /><br />That said, this album did serve a useful purpose. I probably had the largest album collection of any student in my dorm while in college circa 1978 - 82, and people were constantly hanging out in my room to listen to music. When I really wanted to get everyone cleared out, \\"Metal Machine Music\\" was the record I plopped down on the turntable. It really is that annoying. The sound of two guitars set to eleven and then feeding back into each other for exactly one hour. The most audacious release ever by a mainstream artist, it landed in 99 cent bins (remember those?) within weeks, where I bought mine. Even then, I still felt like I'd been had.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype. This was Lou Reed's big joke on the public and especially on RCA. Claiming you dig it now and that it's an avant garde masterpiece only shows you to be still gullible after all these years. I give it two stars just based on the fact that Lou has managed to keep this con running into the CD age.
B00FGEO9NE|5|We can't get this on TV so we anxiously await the arrival of the DVD.  We enjoy watching each episode more than once to catch details of scene, costuming, light, narrative, and acting that were just background the first or second viewing.
B000055ZB8|5|Having seen the marvelous &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; a few nights ago, I went home and watched the Image DVD of F.W. Murnau's classic &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. Ever wake up from a nightmare with the feeling that you were suffocating? Well, I have that feeling when I watch &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. The film is not without its &quot;shocks&quot;, such as the scene when Orlock rises up from his coffin aboard the doomed ship, like an erect, diseased male organ, but its power is in its overall creepy, almost stifling sense of doom. The camerawork is remarkable, free of the staginess that would undermine Tod Browning's &quot;Dracula&quot; ten years later. The staginess of Browning's film may have been due to the problems with early sound film, as well as laziness on Browning's part, where the film looks like &quot;a filmed play&quot;, with the exception of the remarkable first scenes in Transylvania. But, back to &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. The print quality is excellent, considering the fact that this film is 80 years old, and the organ score contributes to the nightmare on the screen. My only complaint about &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is the ridiculous overacting, but hey, this IS a silent film. And now, I have to put my own &quot;spin&quot; on the classic image of Max Schreck as Count Orlock. When something is created that is so incredibly frightening, it becomes a &quot;classic image&quot;.  Count Orlock looks like an incredibly thin, two-legged rat. Thomas Kuntz, a brilliant sculptor and model-kit designer, whose figure of Count Orlock is a masterpiece, says, &quot;He puts the RAT in Nosferatu&quot;. Byron couldn't have said it more eloquently!
B000002JEV|5|Led Zeppelin, to me, is one of the greatest and probably my favorite British band of the 60's.  The Beatles took music in new directions, and the Stones may have made it okay for skinny white kids to like the blues,  but Led Zeppelin took the music they loved and transformed it into their  very own, pushing the envelope, and making music that is every bit as  heavy, and far more intense, than anything around now.  And this is coming  from a 16 year old kid!  The BBC Sessions document Zeppelin at their  greatest.  The sheer intensity, the joy of playing, and the balls to the  wall mentality is captured here, live in concert, in front of a very proper  British audience.  I'm not going to describe it any further, because  nothing I will say can do it justice, but this is one of the very greatest  concert documents out there.  It's up there with the Who's Live at Leeds.
0743244249|3|Delillo is, undisputedly, one of the great contemporary authors, but this book falls a bit short of the bar set, albeit almost unreachably high, by White Noise.  As usual, his characterization capitalizes on the protagonists unusual thought patterns and conclusions that are drawn from seemingly ordinary situations.  The true genius of Delillo is that his characters are like philosophical machines, rather than normal people, but we perceive them, in a way, just like ourselves.  What is really disappointing about this book is that the idea is so good, but the end result isnt refined enough.  Fast paced Manhattan, stretch limousines, fancy gadgetry, the emptiness, of moneyWhats not to love (or love to hate)?  Its all there, but the story doesnt push the reader like Delillos other works.  We are given the framework for a great novel, but the conclusions arent monumental enough to warrant a work with such a thin plot line.  Of course the book still warrants reading for lovers of contemporary fiction.
0142410349|4|I had to purchase this book for a literary theory course, and it had a surprising amount of material open to discussion! Quentin Blake's iconic illustrations add a new discursive dimension to the text, whether it be through the lens of Marxist, Gender, or Feminist theory.<br /><br />The story is also very short--students can finish it in like an hour. If there are any lit theory teachers out there, please consider this book.

1594200823|3|I really wish I could give this book a better rating: The author's analysis of Americans' separation from their food was fascinating, and he explained the evils of industrialized food production better than I've seen anyone else do. The book is a bit frightening, actually: I get the impression that the right disease spreading among our industrial farms could paralyize the system and lead to disaster. He clearly points out that while there's much to be said for efficiency in food production, there's also a huge downside.  That said, Pollan interjects himself way too much in this book. Frankly, I don't care about the near-orgasmic thrill he got from hunting \\"wild\\" pig, nor do I care about his social inadequacies that were evident as he prepared a meal for his new-found friends.  A good editor would have made Pollan cut out most of the references to himself, eliminated the repetition and ended up cutting this book down to about half its size. Then I might have given the book five stars. There's plenty of interesting info about our food supply here, and Pollan certainly has a philosophy worth consideration, but there's too much self-indulgent blather to wade through to get to it.
B000WZAE1I|5|I just love this movie and can watch it over and over. It's so much fun and has a little bit of everything in it. Even the boys can enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|2|Too much like temple run. Great graphics though and I love minions but didn't care for the game. I did like the way the game prompted me that my minion was waiting to run.
6300248550|5|I saw this beautiful adaptation of my favorite book on Public TV.  I paid $80 for videos the moment they were available and have never regretted it for a moment  I watch it frequently and love it more every time, especially  when compared with other versions I have also seen.  Dalton is marvelous;  Clarke so convincing.  The scene in the drawing room breaks my heart every  time I see it.  So wonderful to see original dialogue done with such flair.   It is like having the book come to life in front of my eyes.
B005CRQ4GU|5|if i were you i would read the book because it has great detail and the drawings are great so read this book

B00IRISI42|5|I loved all three of the John Puller novels, but &#34;The Escape&#34; was my favorite. The plot twists keep you turning pages.  and you never be sure who is in your corner. Amanda Knox is the perfect co-worker for Puller.  I hope we see more of this series and bring back Knox.  What a pair!
B0032UYFA6|5|I don't remember a show of this quality and intensity since the best seasons of The Sopranos.  I am amazed as each episode puts me on the edge of my seat and leaves me yelling \\"MORE! MORE, DAMNIT! at the end.  The writing and acting are a cut above just about any other drama on television. Hurry up with season 4- I can hardly wait. Start with season one and work your way up. Just remember to set an alarm or you will stay up watching all night!
B000007VCM|5|Love has to be the fastest transportation device to the farthest destination ever created by human being. The Egyptian recalls make me think that The Cult really come from a different world. This album is just a pure hour of emotion. Sounds, lyrics, instruments, vocals play as one.  <br />Love is not only another amazing album out there, it's a DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Loved this book.  It was beautifully written. The details seemed to come alive on the pages. Beautiful characters.

B00D0OR5EC|3|This review was originally posted on my blog Little Miss Reader ([...])<br /><br />I love stories set in mental hospitals, I think it's an interesting setting and quite different from anything else, which was why I was looking forward to reading this book. It didn't really disappoint me with the setting but I would have loved a bit more detailed description of some of the things and I felt like Susanna was very absent most of the time. It was as if she saw everything from the outside instead of actually being the main character, as she obviously is, since the story is about her.<br /><br />I loved that everytime a new character was introduced, the chapter seemed to focus on that particular character. Why she was there, what she was like, who she was before she got to the McLean Hospital. I enjoyed getting to know the characters - even though some of them were quite different and some scared me.<br /><br />Even though I loved the setting, the book still had its boring parts - and in a book with less than 200 pages that is not that great. But since this is a nonfiction book and not a fiction book, it is understandable. Susanna didn't make things up, this is her story about her time living in a mental hospital becoming friends with people who never got out or never returned.<br /><br />With all that in mind I am a bit torn about this book, on one hand I enjoyed it, and on the other I am a bit \\"meh\\". My \\"meh\\" is probably because I had some expectations for this book and it didn't really live up to them. So I will give this book a 3 heart rating
B00005J79J|5|loved them!
B00170DEM8|5|I love the old musicals with Gene Kelly and all the other actors from the 30's to the 50's. They are great movies to have around.
B004I8WD6E|5|As a serial iphone case purchaser, I can say this case looks and feels great.  Fits snug on the phone, and offers good protection.  I've dropped it a few times and not a scratch.  Big fan.
B00005JN2X|5|Michael Mann is at the top of his game.  This riveting thriller combines nicely etched characters, sharp and pointed dialogue, explosive action and violence, delivered with the intelligence, wit and intensity Mann brilliantly brings to the genre.  Like Tarantino, Michael Mann knows when the extreme closeup of his actors faces is all that is required to reveal character and mood and that cross-cutting this intimacy with superbly choreographed violence creates atmosphere and tension lacking from the films of their less-gifted bretheren.<br /><br />The film just plain looks great.  Michael Mann captures the nighttime streets of LA in as mesmerizing a way as his daytime shootout on those same streets in Heat was simply un-toppable.  Beyond the look, the choices of locales, and the mood and pace of the film are spot-on.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is terrific in this role and is matched all the way by Jamie Foxx.  It is basically a two character drama, so the two leads had to carry their weight and they did so admirably.  I had no trouble accepting \\"pretty-boy\\" Cruise as a ruthless, coldly calculating, remorseless and relentless contract killer.  It is a very nice piece of work.  Jamie Foxx has the more difficult \\"straight-man\\" role, and he acquits himself well.<br /><br />The production is meticulous.  The supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is perfect, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo carrying the largest support, but also fine cameos by Javier Bardham and others.<br /><br />This is class work by a fine director, cast and crew.  The 5 stars are, of course, for fans of thrillers.  The story may be a stretch with a bit of a hole here and there, the climax almost Terminator-like in relentlessness, but you will be hard pressed to find a more intense or better thriller anywhere.  This is the movies folks, done by people who know how to make em!
B00PTB7B34|5|just like clash of clans but call of duty themed
B009ANP48G|3|If you're expecting somethig different from this movie then you are mistaken. It lived up to its expectations, I love to dance and plus I own the rest so I had to have it in my collection.

B0053TWVDC|4|OK MOVIE
B00ANTX3HA|5|For students of political science, The Fog of War is like taking the concepts of Realism and war and giving it a personal and bayonet turning twist in the gut. Here, we can see political theory become reality in bloody numbers and cold, calculated policy decisions.<br /><br />Robert McNamara, for all his divisive policies, puts a human spin on the decisions he made during his tenure and helps provide context to foreign policy choices that, when seen from the vacuum of a text book or essay always, can't possibly be considered correct. Yet, somehow McNamara manages to bring you into the decisions he was forced to make and help you understand the repercussions of them. The Fog of War gives you a view of foreign policy from 30,000 feet while still feeling human. An amazing accomplishment, to be sure.
B00JQHOEAU|5|If you love The Lion King, if you love the music, and if you want to hear it like you've never heard it before, then this is the collection for you. For years, I have wanted to find the complete recorded score of the movie, but from what I can tell, it's never been released before. Now, I have my chance to listen to the music as it is heard in the movie. The music ... what can I say about the music that no one has said before? It is, in my opinion, Disney's finest display of musical prowess. Teaming up Elton John, Tim Rice, and Hans Zimmer to do the songs and orchestration was a stroke of genius. There's really not much else I can say about this collection. The music is great, the packaging is great, the artwork on the front and inside the case is great. It's a must-buy for any fan of one of Disney's greatest animated achievements. Buy it if you haven't already.
B003O86FMW|5|I learned that Katniss still uses the old house to change and do other things around that house and also I learned that Gale works in the coal mines now as and that Katniss only gets to see Gale on Sundays now!
B00JB3MVCW|3|Didn't know it was a comedy.
B0015AARJI|4|Nothing fancy in terms of options. Since it is ORM controller, it did what it is expected to do. Price was right on Amazon.
B006LSZECO|1|It may have been praised by a lot of people. It may have been in the top for quite a while. This is why I bought it. Big mistake.<br /><br />Maybe I did not major in Literature, but I did a LOT of reading at my life, after graduating a Language high school. This book did not raise any of my interests. The plot was boring and I was not at all interested in finding out how it ended. Actually I was...I jumped directly at the last pages.<br /><br />There are other books, more captivating, that will not make you wonder through the minds of a mentally-troubled woman.
044022425X|4|I wish Amazon had a 4.5 star because that is what this book deserves. A better-researched author is not out there! She makes history come alive. If you like historical fiction with a paranormal twist and don't mind ( or are thrilled) with saga-length...this is the series for you. Start with Outlander...
B006ON41FC|5|it is an amazing game it takes a while to beat but its very fun I wish there were more updates for it
B000URDEB0|5|i am always a big fan of nightwish. it was sad to see eva leave the band, but she had things to take care of, so i respected that. i think this album is still awesome. they really inspired me so much with my music too. i'm a producer, and they are worthy to be inspired.<br /><br />[...]
B007Q2N0HA|5|Ok, I will admit it.  I love Sylvia Day.  I've read tons of her books and they're some of the few paperbacks I kept after getting my kindle a few years ago.  So, it's not really a surprise that I loved this story, too.  (My heart is still a little bit in my throat as I write this review, actually.)  Gideon and Eva are complicated, but endearing.  I was rooting for them all the way.  And Cary, Eva's best friend, was character perfection.  I hope his story gets told as well, I know it will be a good read.  I am wishing I knew the release date of the next book in this series because I am dying for the rest of their story...<br />Edited to add: The author has stated she hopes to have the next book in the series out in October 2012. *happy dance*
B000I9U9A4|1|where is
B000R9J3X4|5|I adore this band and Shirley Manson rules. This disc has all the greatest hits and it's the one to choose if you are a fan of Garbage.
B009166NA0|5|I would recommend this documentary. It was a very interesting insight to the life and beliefs of a musical legend.
B0079R8IYW|4|I like this cover a lot. The kindle Fire slips into the cover perfectly and the screen is framed by it. There is an inside pocket and credit card slots and the stand feature in this case also works well. It is a lightweight very smooth leather finish. The only negative I could say is that finger marks show up very easily, but so far have been easily wiped away, but my daughters greasy prints after eating pizza took a while to disappear. Highly reccomended.
B007IXWKUK|4|It took me until after Chapter 9 to get into the first book.  Book 2, I already liked the characters and there was more plot.  I loved the email subject lines/closings, I even went back to read the ones I missed when I realized they were changing. Momentum was already there from end of first book.  Overall, I liked it and bought book three.
B00005QK3W|3|This was bound to happen someday...<br />McCartney's new album is a decent effort, an unusual snapshot of his current life and times.  He's rarely been one to wear his heart openly on his sleeve, but if we are to take him at face value, he's opened up his soul more than ever before on this.  Listening to the pain, aching, hoping and praying in the lyrics, he's letting us see him as he rarely does - in fact, rarely ever has.<br />But in this effort of clarity, there's something surprisingly missing: the music.  Paul McCartney is well known for being one of the greatest pop songwriters of the 20th century, but now as we are into the 21st, his greatest skills seem to be diminished.  His famous hook-y melodies (whether they be ballads or rockers, he's always crafted great melodies) are nowhere to be found.  Instead, we get one-note groove songs, and even these seem to be repetitive from song to song.  On the occasions where he does stab into his craft, it's slight, almost lame.  As an example, \\"From A Lover To A Friend\\" reminded me of that hilarious scene in `The Rutles' where the McCartney character tries vainly to write a ballad, only to come up with a lah-lah-lah-lah valentine.  This is so surprising from Sir Cute Beatle.<br />Just as disarming are his vocals.  McCartney's pitch has always been top-notch, but here his voice is weak and he misses almost as many notes as he hits.  Once might attribute this to age, but there are as many pop vocalists of his generation and age that are still as strong as ever - yet McCartney's vocal prowess seems to be in dire shape.<br />But on the plus side, this is a snappy feeling record.  His band is punchy, contemporary, and Paul's bass playing is as solid and expressive as ever.<br />I was surprised and disappointed in \\"Driving Rain\\"...hopefully his next step into the CD spotlight may be stronger.  I hope he's not \\"done\\" yet.
B000055Y0X|5|While the previous version of Strangelove on DVD looked terrific it really was lacking in extras. That would put it on a par with the Kubrick films released by Warner Brothers (where Warner elected to remove the only extra on the 2001 DVD previously seen on the MGM version and provided few to no extras on all the other films). To be fair, that was Kubrick's wish before he died. He wasn't interested in digging up a lot to put on the DVDs. He felt the films should speak for themselves. Then again, that's why there are film historians to make sure this stuff is put.<br />A deft satire about nuclear war, the paranoia of the Communist era US and precious bodily fluids, Strangelove benefits from Kubrick's distant style as a film director. With the exception of The Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, there wasn't any political satires quite as sharp as Strangelove. Kubrick had purchased the novel Red Alert (by Peter George) in hopes of turning it into a serious look at the risk of nuclear weapons. As he prepared the final screenplay he realized that the absurdity of the situation was actually funny. Kubrick hired comic novelist Terry Southern to work with him on the final script and a comic classic was born.<br />The entire cast is perfect. Peter Sellers brings to life three separate characters all with their individual quirks and so different that it's hard to believe that they are being played by the a same actor. Unfortunately, as Sellers career progressed he never did have the staying hand that a director like Kubrick could provide. He gave many memorable performances before and after but his best performances were for Kubrick ( with the exception of Hal Ashby's Being There).<br />It's well known that George C. Scott didn't care for much of his final performance in Strangelove; he felt that Kubrick always went for the take that was over the top. He was right. It worked perfectly. Every other actor is in top form and the deadpan Sterling Hayden nearly steals his scenes with Sellers.<br />The transfer is very, very good. The extras are appropriate given this film's classic status. Included are a documentary and featurette on the making of the film. The interviews with James Earl Jones (this was his first film)and other surviving crew members are enlightening and often quite funny. There's also photos in the documentary of the fabled pie fight conclusion (sadly, the footage for this sequence no longer exists). The documentary covers everything from the inception of the project to the marketing after it was released. We also get an advertising gallery, the cutting edge theatrical trailers and production notes on the making of the film. Oh, and the inclusion of the original split-screen interviews (provided to television stations as a pre-packaged interview with the actors answering questions that would be mouthed by local critics later)is great. Scott's is particularly interesting and funny.<br />Step into the world of Strangelove and discover a past as serious as it was absurd.ers.<br />The transfer is very, very good.

B00005K3LU|5|This is the film that would influence hundreds of action films for years to come, made director John McTiernan a household name, and made a global superstar out of Bruce Willis.  Willis stars as New York Detective John McClaine, who goes to Los Angeles to see his wife (Bonnie Bedilia) and family, but finds himself running and gunning for his life when a group of terrorists take over the Nakatomi building holding hostages (including his wife), and only McClaine can stop them.  As the Amazon review says, Die Hard would set the stage for action films for years to come such as Under Siege, Passenger 57, and Executive Decision; but none of those films could ever match the intense action (possibly some of McTiernan's best directing in his career), engaging cinematography (courtesy of Jan de Bont who would later helm another action masterpiece with Speed), and fantastic performances from Willis (his wisecracking one liners would also set the stage for future big screen heroes) and Alan Rickman as the nefarious head terrorist Hans Gruber.  This Five Star edition of the film is great and is undoubtadly one of 20th Century Fox's best produced DVD's on the market.  The great picture transfer allows us to see the brilliance of the film, and the commentary from McTiernan is worth the price of admission alone.  The branching scenes don't add much to the film, but they themselves are a nice extra.  This blockbuster would also spawn an inferior (but nonetheless action packed and fun) sequel that was directed by Renny Harlin, and McTiernan would return to the helm for the third and in my opinion best installment, Die Hard With A Vengeance.  All in all, consider this essential viewing if you've ever called yourself an action film fan.
B000YXMMAO|5|Great album. Record sounds amazing
B008P9M614|5|I am a sucker for House's antics.  His personality and sense of humor match mine perfectly (not sure if that is a good thing or not).  It is semi graphic so if you don't like blood and semi-realistic views of the inside of human bodies - this may not be for you.<br /><br />There are a few episodes that get a little too serious for me but they always seem to come back to the good old House that I like to watch.  If you like the show - the complete series is a no brainer.<br /><br />I would also recommend the mentalist for a similar type of personality in a different show.<br /><br />5 Stars from me.
B007H9B8FS|4|Sounds and moves like a dream you want to keep having, really good music and vocals and the flow of the album makes sense song to song.  Repeat listen worthy (been in the car for several months) and does not get old.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|A story told like only John Grisham can tell. Suspenseful with lots of detail and historical facts to give in-depth insight to his story.  I'm a Grisham fan and this definitely is one of my favorites.  I live in the South and found it interesting his portrayal of the black and white issue.
B00000FZ1V|5|It is a commonly accepted truism that when one returns as an adult to a book or film one loved as a child, the book or film proves to be a very different work from that which one remembered.  One usually finds that the story one fell in love with as a child is significantly less funny, exciting or appealing than it was back then. <br /> <br />\\"Ghostbusters\\", which I recently saw for the first time in twenty years, is an exception to this rule.  Admittedly I did not feel the same overwhelming excitement, amusement and awe that I experienced in my aunt's living room in 1986 -- I am no longer six years old -- but the **movie** itself is the same film, almost exactly as I remembered it.  It was like meeting an old friend after twenty years and finding that he had not aged a day.  So many scenes came flooding back to me:  Aykroyd sliding down the firepole; Moranis running around New York looking for the Gatekeeper; Weaver greeting Murray at the door in her vamp outfit; the precise movement of girl-Gozer's arms as she shouts, \\"Then DIE!!!\\"; the first appearance of the Marshmallow Man, glimpsed between the buildings... <br /> <br />Another commonly accepted fact is that comedy is harder to do well than drama.  Even so, I'm not sure people realize how much work goes into making a film like \\"Ghostbusters\\" as good as it is.  The steadily mounting levels of humor and terror in this film crescendo so effectively that, by the time Mr. Stay-Puft shows up, we willingly suspend our disbelief.  On some level I am aware as a viewer that our world isn't quite as wacky as the world of \\"Ghostbusters\\" -- but on some level I wish it were. <br /> <br />Seldom can the cast of a motion picture have been so intrinsic to its essence.  \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" would have been much the same film with Sean Connery as Gandalf, just as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" would be the same with W.C. Fields in the title role.  If John Belushi had lived to star in \\"Ghostbusters\\" instead of Bill Murray, or if John Candyhad signed up for the role taken by Rick Moranis, it probably would have been an excellent film... but it wouldn't have been the **same** film, not by any stretch of the imagination.  (But I have to say that Aykroyd delivers my favorite performance in the movie.) <br /> <br />As Ivan Reitman, Joe Medjuck and Harold Ramis point out on their DVD commentary, the unsung hero of \\"Ghostbusters\\" is Elmer Bernstein.  Unfairly overshadowed by Ray Parker Jr.'s deservedly successful theme song, Bernstein's music captures and enhances all the charm, humor and terror of this film, from the ickiness of Venkman throwing the slime on his hand onto the library books to the blossoming of the love theme for Venkman and Dana over the happiest of happy ending scenes. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, the feature of the film that stuck with me most strongly as a six-year-old is almost never mentioned in reviews:  the one moment of sincere manly emotion between Murray and Aykroyd's characters at the film's climax.  This moment, perfectly played by the two actors, does not even appear in the final shooting script and must have been a last minute addition.  It is very fitting that this moment is as brief as it is, and is soon forgotten in the jubilation of the end credit scene.  Little boys long for this kind of emotion, and yet at the same time are deeply embarrassed by it.  The heroes of \\"Ghostbusters\\" are the kind of adults most little boys want to grow up to be -- clever, funny, kind and brave.  And after twenty-two years \\"Ghostbusters\\" remains (and this is no criticism) one of the best movies ever made for those who are little boys at heart, whether they are six or twenty-seven. <br /> <br />And it has the best final line in the history of cinema.  \\"I LOVE THIS TOWN!!!\\"

B00PSLQGX6|5|Again, as in other seasons, Downton Abbey leaves me wanting more. Times are changing, family is growing and some are planning to move away. Mary is still a brat. Grandmama is slightly more human and this makes her more likeable. I still get irritated with the Earl. I feel sorry for Anna and Mr. Bates. I really enjoyed the Christmas festivities. I even learned what a Spotted Dick is! I hope there will be a season 6. I do love the series.
B009T3AE1Y|5|The movie is exiting and brings out the best in Robert Pattinson. It was a difficult read as a book but the scene with Paul was like a well thought over, chess game . You can feel the emptiness in Pattinsons character , the desperate search of why he can't find excitement other than in destroying everything he build. Just like Paul he tries of find a meaning. To be honest , I never imagined this book being a Movie but I give it to Cronenberg, its very compelling. Do not buy if you are interested in some action fast paced movie because this film plays out more as a performance on stage with dialog after dialog. You really need to pay attention
B000E2AZ2C|4|1982's \\"Blade Runner\\" was a highly original and dramatic sci-fi thriller starring Harrison Ford as Decker, a burnt-out bounty hunter living in a high tech 21st Century Los Angeles.  Decker is a so-called blade runner; his job is to hunt down rogue replicants, human-like androids genetically engineered to resemble humans and who sometimes go out of control.  The replicants have exceptional strengths and abilities, but come with a pre-programmed lifespan.  Only an experienced blade runner like Decker can spot one in a crowd.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Decker is lured out of retirement to track down four renegade replicants, led by Rutger Haur as their ruthless but oddly philosophical leader.  The four rogues attempt to hide in the dark, rainy forest of high-rises that is Los Angeles, a multi-cultural Tokyo on steroids.<br /><br />Decker will hunt down the rogues one by one.  Each confrontation serves to build sympathy for the replicants, who seem only too human in their desire to live, and for Decker, who has come to loath his job.  Decker will get assistance from Rachel (Sean Young), herself a replicant.  Decker's confrontation with his final opponent is a haunting indication of what a replicant might or might not be capable of.<br /><br />This edition of \\"Blade Runner\\" has the ending presented in the original theatrical release, including Decker's explanatory voice-over.  Other editions of this movie, which has spawned its own cult following, have other endings, director cuts, and revisions.  Highly recommended as a ground-breaking example of the sci-fi genre.

B000P0I4O4|5|I clearly understand where the detractors are coming from.  They did not have the patience (or the initiative to fast forward) through the first few bits where one gets the impression that John Cusack is a dim-witted loser.  I was cursing him myself, which in retrospect is a testimonial to his acting ability.<br /><br />As a former Marine Corps infrantry officer and clandestine spy who likes to tune out with DVDs, I give this movie my highest rating.<br /><br />The first few sets are indeed boring and annoying, but they are setting the stage for \\"loser makes good.\\"<br /><br />This is an uplifting film about a father connects with his son, a wimp who becomes a lion, a teacher who meets love in the forest, I could go one, but I will not.<br /><br />Buy or rent this film and be patient (or fast forward).  This is a feel good inspiring film and all these reviewers that do not like it are just not getting the value that I, for one, certainly received.<br /><br />ANY movie with Morgan Freeman is a winner.

193700788X|4|Honestly, I was a bit disappointed by the ending of the series but that's something I just have to accept. Ms. Harris couldn't make everyone happy. I still enjoyed it a lot.
B004VUP8WK|5|I actually enjoy this album a lot.  I know I'm not supposed to, according to all the naysayers and haters.  But it's good to hear David Vincent's vocals on a Morbid Angel album again (even though Steve Tucker was more brutal and emotional).  You don't often hear death metal vocalists who enunciate so clearly as Vincent, an amazing skill in a genre that's full of generic unintelligible growling.  Yes, it took many listens to appreciate the album as a whole, because half of it is so different than what I expected.  Is that a bad thing?  No.  This great work by an equally talented band (led by the master of all, Trey Azagthoth) reveals new surprises with each listen.  A lot of people condemn the experimentation, I like it; Morbid Angel have been throwing surprises into every album since &#34;Blessed Are The Sick.&#34;  The contributions by Destructhor and Tim Yeung are very strong as well, but nothing is ever as compelling as when Trey Azagthoth destroys on another and another sick solo.  I will always miss Pete Sandoval, the greatest drummer ever.  Considering his absence, this is still a powerful work.
B0060YIBLK|5|This book is short and to the point. It has everything you could ever need in experienced advice in a brilliantly separated way. The simple fact that I got it and was done reading it in 3hrs speaks volumes about it's quality. I just couldn't put it down. Everything just makes sense. And even better, it's applicable! It's not just some advice spewed out by people making theories on what they think will work. It's actual experience being given to you on what does work and what doesn't. This is definitely a book everyone should read.
B00006IUL7|5|Much as I enjoyed Chris Nolan's \\"Following\\" and \\"Memento\\", he really pulls out all the stops with this third film. I saw the foreign film upon which this was based and, unusually, this is the better film.  (Usually American remakes of foreign films are total schlock but that is not true here.)  It has some key ingredients for achieving this though.  First off, a first rate script that no one has \\"Hollywoodized.\\" Secondly, letting Al Pacino and Robin Williams loose with their talents on first rate material and, in Williams' case, against his usual type, was sheer genius.  The two are absolutely superb together.<br /><br />Pacino is the anti-hero cop who investigates a murder case in Alaska while trying to cope with a partner (Martin Donovan) who is going to turn state's evidence against him when they return to LA.  Not only will this ruin his career but it might also release all the murderers Pacino's character put away in prison. The partners are trying to track down the villain, Williams.  Surprisingly though, instead of running, Williams' villain comes forward and plays with Pacino's character, preying upon his weaknesses.  Pacino is further handicapped by not being able to get any sleep because of a variety of factors but not the least of which is that he's not used to sunlight 24/7 which occurs in Alaska in the warmer weather.  Martin Donovan and Hillary Swank do very good work as the other detectives but it is hard to compare them against the sheer star power and magnetism of Pacino and Williams together. The murder case is actually not as important as the unravelling of these two men's characters.  Buy it.

If you have not read Agatha Christie before, I suggest you start with another of her excellent novels first so that you can savor this one all the more.

B001GCUO1Q|5|Good movie
B002HFJ77S|5|I bought this book during my trip, I didn't expect the warmth and charming characters from the cover I saw. But once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop reading it. Bringing it up to read anytime I could during my trip and finished it with smiless. Love how the story develops and ends. Also bought this book as a gift for my bestie's BD
078401213X|5|The dvd I ordered was shipped promptly and arrived in great condition just as promised.  Thanks
B000000XCA|5|THE great ccr album.It will always be best known for being the home of \\"Proud Mary\\",but even better stuff is here.\\"Born On the Bayou\\"\\"Bootleg\\"\\"Penthouse Pauper\\".Still sounds as good today as it did when my friends and I were wearing the 8-track tape out over 30 years ago.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love this show, its like watching real people.  I only wish the seasons weren't so short!<br /><br />This was my first time purchasing anything using the Amazon Prime, and I was very happy with my experience! It was a very fast and easy transaction.  I like that I can watch it wherever I am. I will definitely consider purchasing through Prime again.
B001HIJYR4|1|This DVD won't play in dvd player! I have to put it in the laptop!

B0083SBMBM|5|I follow up on alot of the marvel comic heros because of my son.He loves the comics thus I have to take him to see them in the movies and end up buying the dvd.I really like the way they had all five of the main marvel characters in one great movie.That was a good idea and I hope they combine others for furure movies!I I'm  just saying it was a good idea to have them work as a team  with alot of action and special effects.Our whole family can watch this movie with no disappointments or bad language!  Anyone that likes the super heros will want this one for their personal collection.
0060555661|5|Very good book
B007GEMQ2I|5|I had hesitated about buying legos from amazon after ordering a couple sets a few years ago and having them arrive with the boxes bashed and loose legos released from their individual bags sliding around inside the actual Danish lego box.  But when I saw the Lego Town Hall on sale for $180, I couldn't resist, as it was #1 on my son's Christmas list.  I was relieved when it arrived completely intact.  Perhaps complaints about the need for better packaging to protect the precious legos was taken into account after customers complained, as I ordered several lego items from amazon this Christmas season and they all arrived undamaged.  Hopefully, the Jeff Bezos customer service pledge was applied and from now on legos will be shipped with sufficient padding to protect them!  My son spent most of Christmas day putting it together!  It's a FANTASTIC set.
B002ZG99TA|3|The movie was not formated for regular screen
0062197258|5|In some ways, I am glad I finished this novel because I can finally catch up on my sleep!  This book kept me up for hours.  I would tell myself that I would only read one more chapter, but then I couldn't stop myself from reading more.  Do not be discouraged by the fact that the setting is the UK.  I quickly learned the cultural differences, the changes in vocabulary, etc.  This book is highly suspenseful, realistic, and filled with details that are often painful to read.  This was an exceptional debut novel about a woman's struggle to escape her past and move forward.
B00FRQ32N4|3|I loved the but one day I made a lot of progress then it just rstarted
B00AMBK6J2|5|I thought this move was hilarious! You might have to have somewhat of a twisted sense of humor to enjoy this movie.  I'd say if you don't, you might not want to waste your time or money. Be prepared to laugh....a lot.
B000LC55F2|3|You think they could have come up with a better script.  Good actors, but the script had them behaving like 3-year olds playing tit-to-tat throughout.  Oh good grief - this isn't entertainment.  Wouldn't recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5|I love this game. Just downloaded it, and it's very addicting. It can become challenging after awhile, but it starts off easy. Love it
B000Q6GUW0|5|As great as Season One is ... Two is even better! Michael Hall was superb in Six Feet Under but you'll know him forever more as Dexter after viewing Season One.     Highly recommended on so many levels. Showtime hits the mark with this one but still having a hard time believing they cancelled HUFF and refuse to release the already aired Season Two of that other gem.    Dexter ... a very likeable serial killer. Clever, inventive, well acted and always a joy to view. Sunday nights - we never miss it. Bought the box set on a hunch months ago and all my buds are now hooked. 5 easy stars.
0312853238|5|Ender's Game, written by Orson Scott Card, is, in my opinion, a fantastic book.  It is very well written, and it presents a great plot.  It does, however, have a few downsides to it.  In this essay you will read about the good and bad aspects of this  book.<br /> I have several arguments saying that Ender's Game is a good  book.  One of these is that Ender is a strong, well-portrayed character.   He has many sides to him.  He loves his sister, hates his brother, is a  military genius, and is the youngest of the launchies (new recruits or  students at Battle School) to be promoted to an army.  His teachers feign  favoring Ender in order to isolate him by making the other boys dislike  him.  Ender is forced to prove himself time and again, and is finally  accepted into the group.  When the teachers see that he has been accepted,  they put him in an army to further isolate him and make him prove himself  yet again.  They are trying to teach him that no one will help him.   P68-69: `Alai looked up at him.  \\"Don't you know?  This was on your bed.   You must have sat on it.\\"  Ender took it from him. ENDER WIGGINS ASSIGNED  SALAMANDER ARMY COMMANDER BONZO MADRID EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY CODE GREEN  GREEN BROWN NO POSSESSIONS TRANSFERRED Ender shook his head.  It was the  stupidest thing he could think of, to promote him now.  Nobody got promoted  before they were eight years old.  Ender wasn't even seven yet.  Just when  things were finally coming together.  Just when his life was finally  getting livable.  \\"I don't want to go,\\" he said.   \\"I understand them,  Ender. [said Alai.] You are the best of us.  Maybe they in a hurry to teach  you everything.\\" \\"They don't want to teach me everything,\\" Ender said.  \\"I  wanted to learn what it was like to have a friend.\\" '   Though this  book may be truly enthralling, there are some downsides to it.  I do not  like the fact that Ender killed two boys in physical fights.  He was  standing up for himself, I know, but I think that just having the boys  hospitalized would have been enough.  Also, at one point in the book, Ender  becomes indifferent to everything because the people at the school have  pushed him so hard.  Though this indifference works well with the story, I  do not think that indifference works with \\"Ender\\" half as well as peanut  butter goes with jelly, or milk with cookies.  Basically, though this is a  great book, there are some parts that I did not like as well as others.<br />  Another strong aspect of Ender's Game is the games.  There are many of  them, but the main one is then one that the armies play.  The children at  Battle School are all obsessed with it.  The game what they all strive to  be the best in.  Some children, like Ender's friend, Dink Meeker, have  their own opinions about the enemy in the games are. P107-108: `  \\"These  other armies, they aren't the enemy.  It's the teachers, they're the enemy.   They get us to fight each other, to hate each other.  The game is  everything.  Win win win.  It amounts to nothing.  We kill ourselves, go  crazy trying to beat each other, and all the time the old bastards are  watching us, studying us, discovering our weak points, deciding whether  we're good enough or not.  Well, good enough for what?  I was six years old  when they brought me here.  What the hell did I know?  They decided I was  right for the program, but nobody ever asked if the program was right for  me.\\" \\"So why don't you go home?\\" [Ender asked.] Dink smiled crookedly.    \\"Because I can't give up the game.  Because I love this.\\"<br />P111: `But  Ender could not stop thinking about what Dink had said.  The Battle School  was so enclosed, the game so important in the minds of the children, that  Ender had forgotten there was a world outside.'   The game is a battle  between two armies.  In the battle, the armies use guns that freeze the  opponent's joint(s) or, if they are hit correctly, their whole body.  In  the battle room, there are some obstacles, stars (p89: `Huge brown boxes  were suspended in midair, partially obstructing the view.  So these were  the obstacles that soldiers called stars.  They were distributed seemingly  at random. ).  There is no gravity in the battle rooms, so whichever way  you are facing is up for you.  The way to win is to completely disable the  other army, and then have at least five soldiers who are completely  unfrozen left. <br /> This book was written in a way that things never got  boring.  All the time there were new twists, turns, and rules being added.   There was character growth, action, and real feelings involved.  Feelings  of hate, love, and sorrow spilling out from Ender, his friends, and his  enemies.  This is a book of excitement, disappointment, anger, fear,  strategy, and games---Ender's games.
B007TBZ63Y|5|I love these books! They are great books! I can't wait for the next one ( house of hades) to come out! 5 stars is the best of all the options I would have given 10!

B008FRFN7A|5|Wonderful accessory when computer &#34;issues&#34; arise.
B003F3NDOE|5|I love this series. It was beautifully constructed, and gave a voice to many women who were feeling ugly. This show promotes that their is more importance of beauty on the inside, then there is of any on the outside. Betty is a young woman who pursues her goals, with vigor, and is an inspiration to any of the girls today that feel left out. By the end of the series, you cannot help but fall in love with her character, and say goodbye with happy tears.
0399146253|1|I have read all of Patrica Cornwell's books and until the last one, I loved all of them. The last one was questionable but this one is terrible. I wonder if she is using a ghost writer. I can't believe the same person who wrote her earlier books wrote this one.

1572816112|3|Let me start off by saying I love artwork and the creativity of these cards. I fully appreciate the time and devotion that went into the design.  That being said, I don't understand why they produced them on such a poor quality card stock. These are NOT cards I would ever consider shuffling (they will easily crease). There does not seem to be a coating on these cards, making them matte and extremely difficult to slide over each other. The lack of a finish makes them susceptible to getting dirty very quickly. I have other cards (Rider-Waite, Arthurian Legend, Love Tarot) and they all have a glossy coating that protects the cards. Such beautiful cards and yet they can never be used without being ruined. A waste of incredible artwork.

030726999X|4|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is the third and final book in Stieg Larsson's thriller trilogy.  In it, our hero Lisbeth Salander lies in a hospital bed down the hall from her murderous father while a secret group within the security police tries to silence her by having her committed yet again.  As usual, the other hero of the books, Mikael Blomkquist, helps Salander's cause through his expert investigative skills.<br /><br />TGWKTHN is a somewhat flat finale to an otherwise great trilogy.  After a beginning compelling for its unraveling of the plot from its predecessor, TGWKTHN devolves into a dull narrative.  There is very little suspense in this book.  The secret group out for Salander at first appear ominous, but Larsson allows very little time for any drama to build around their machinations before he has Blomkquist squelch them.  For a good third of the book, Larsson even keeps the bad guys out of the picture completely while he shifts to an interesting yet ultimately pointless sub-plot involving Berger.  (I do concede however that the author died after finishing this book, and who knows if the proper editing went into it, or if perhaps he had plans for some of the sub-plots in later books.)<br /><br />Essentially TGWKTHN is a very long denouement, where the remaining secrets are revealed and the reader is treated to an orgy of revenge, especially in Salander's trial, where again the bad guys give very little resistance, instead take their beatings well, seemingly resolved to the idea of their henceforth minor status in the story.<br /><br />This is Lisbeth Salander's revenge, and some readers will be happy with this.  For others, the idea that the end of TGWPWF would be the climax of the whole series might come as a disappointment.  Regardless, if you read the first two, you'll have to read this one too.  And despite the disappointing end, I found the trilogy to be a worthwhile endeavor.  Larsson did tie up most of the loose ends and the trilogy was wonderfully smart and touching overall.  That's why I'll give TGWKTHN four-stars rather than the three I would give it if viewed on its own.touching overall.  That's why I'll give TGWKTHN four-stars rather than the three I would give it if viewed on its own.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|Good story. However the story line of Tess, Felicity and Will was completely unnecessary. At some point I begin to skip pass those sections of the book.
B0014LX420|1|Nothing good about this album, the best hits aren't even on here. I'm not a huge Britney fan, but some of her music was catchy.. but this album stinks!
B000KGGLCU|5|Madonna is known for her infectious songs and her spectacular concerts. I do not even know where to begin with the performance part of the Confessions show. AMAZING! I don't want to give anything away as it is filled with a lot of fun suprises. The production (lights, dancing, singing, the stage, the timing, etc...) is simply phenomenal. The show is broken up into 4 different main sections or themes. No wonder it was the highest grossing tour of 2006 - purchasing this will truly show you why.<br /><br />The live CD does not include every single song from the DVD but for sure the highlights. It is an excellent CD, as well.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice and includes several pictures.<br /><br />This is sure to be a classic and is a must have as it entertains from beginning to end and is truly mesmerizing!!
B009HUB40Y|4|This is a fast and fun game
B00002E23E|5|First of all, this is a great movie. Maybe it wasnt the best performance Zeppelin gave, and maybe it has some editing problems. NEVERTHELESS it is Awesome! This movie will change your life. This is the greatest rock concert movie of all time, period. Ignore Leonard Maltin and the others, the fantasy sequences work. And they add to the movie. The DVD really brings out the vivid colors and the sound is great. You can see the details and I heartily recommend it. The fantasy sequences dont interfere with the concert footage and they give you insight into the personalities of the band members. Jones is a dark avenger riding through the graveyard at night in a midevil village. Plant a king Arthur who finds a sword and a fair maiden after a journey through the forest in the springtime. Page a sorcerer who meets himself on the mountain in the dark forest. And Bonham, a pool playing, beer drinking, car racing family man. This concert still holds up today and there is nothing like it. Ive watched it over a 100 times over the last 10 years and I still never get bored of it. There's always something new to see. It ranks up there with Star Wars and The Wizard of OZ, an all time classic. This movie is a gift, from Thor and his band LED ZEPPELIN.
B009QD0MYQ|3|not to much to really go off of for this CD since I just heard them on Youtube and bought the CD. The band is ok but really just one song was all that I wanted.
B000063COX|4|THE BAND: Paul Di'Anno (vocals), Steve Harris (bass), Dave Murray (guitar), Dennis Stratton (guitar), Clive Burr (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1980) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 40 minutes. Recorded at Kingsway Studios, London. This is the band's debut album. The disc contains a 22-page booklet with a brief intro, song lyrics, numerous band pictures, and thank you's. All songs written by Harris, Di'Anno and/or Murray. The enhanced CD features a nice multimedia section for your PC - including 2 videos (live performances of \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\"), the band's catalog of albums, band history, family tree, itinerary from the '80 Europe Tour, and more. Digitally remastered in 1998. Cover art by Derek Riggs. Label - Sanctuary.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Some will claim Iron Maiden's debut as a \\"masterpiece\\". While it's a good album; an important album; an essential album in the band's catalog; our introduction to mascot \\"Eddie\\"... I simply can't label it as such. It's not as professional, slick, or complex as their 2nd release (\\"Killers\\"), or any of Dickinson's 1st three albums with the band - these were masterpieces. The sound on this debut, though digitally remastered, is still pretty raw. Maybe that's the appeal here. Kind of like debuts from Kiss, Rush, Motley Crue, Def Leppard... all good starts, but I can't label them masterpieces. With each, their best albums were still ahead of them - and that applies to Iron Maiden too. For me, the sound of Iron Maiden's debut is caught somewhere between Motorhead and the Sex Pistols. The music fits here - and to my ears, Di'Anno's vocals are somewhere between Lemme Kilmister and Johnny Rotten. For the most part, the songs are quickly paced, straight ahead angry rock, with a side of punk thrown in. Di'Anno was somewhat gruff and unpolished vocally (his lack of desire and drug/alcohol issues later on would eventually make his stay with the band a short one). The album opens in great form. \\"Prowler\\" is probably my favorite track here - nice guitar opening, cool lyrics, lightning fast guitar solo, great melody. \\"Sanctuary\\" and the album closer \\"Iron Maiden\\" are great tracks and can still be heard at their concerts. \\"Running Free\\" with it's thundering drums is also a crowd favorite and the only single released back in 1980... the song reached #34 on the UK charts. Other highlights and lost gems include the tender \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and \\"Strange World\\", the simplistic instrumental \\"Transylvania\\", and the 7-minute epic \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". Keep in mind - Iron Maiden would endure several band member changes during their early years... and when singer Bruce Dickinson joined (1982), the band would never sound the same again.

B008JFUO4U|4|Not what I expected.  Which can be a good thing.  I was very suprised by the story.  If your an action junkie i think you might want to skip this one.  But if you like a balance than this would be a good pick.  Very good director as well (TRON).

She is truly a superstar and I would gladly have paid a $100 for her debut album so for the $9.99 price it is a excellent deal. My words cannot begin to do justice in describing just how great Susan Boyle is and that she is a superstar for this era.
B004H4XDBI|5|Great book that follows up to If I Stay. Will be looking forward to reading more books from Gayle Forman.
B000099T2L|2|I was not impressed with Beyonce's c.d. I purchased her and Monica's at the same time, and Monica's c.d. gets alot more play in my car.  Lyrically, it is a sad c.d. A 5 year old could've written most of the songs.  She's a great performer, and the ballads are great, but overall, it's too \\"britney spears\\" for me.  Nice effort Beyonce.....Maybe the follow up will be better.

I consider &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; to be one of those  rare albums created by a pop artist for which the term &quot;art&quot; is  completely and utterly accurate.<br />But back to &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; as  a traveling companion. Allow me to make two recommendations:<br />1) If you  ever have the opportunity to visit the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, bring  &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; with you. Shortly after you enter the park, when  you're within a few miles of the canyon itself, pop in the CD. As you wind  along the tree-lined road, the repetitive, acoustic strum of the title  track ushers the music along, heightening your hope and anticipation,  higher and higher. Pay attention while Van sings &quot;To lay me down/In  silence easy/To be born again/ To be born again.&quot; When, at last, you  catch your first glimpse of this gigantic, yawning, devastatingly  spectacular thing of beauty, your heart will explode.<br />2) You may wish to  avoid driving while listening to &quot;Madame George,&quot; one of the most  sadly beautiful pieces of music ever written. More than once I've had to  pull to the side of the road, eyes clouded over from tears, unable to bear  the pain of the music and the lyric. No need to be a hazard to your fellow  motorist -- pull over and compose yourself.<br />Good luck in finding your own  memorable &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; driving experience.

B0013FXWU6|1|well, I looked forward to seeing this movie.  I can state right now, what a waste of time and 2 1/2 hours of my life I can not get back.    Daniel Day-Lewis' character was uninspiring - I couldn't get up the emotion to hate his character (which I have to assume is the emotion the director wanted me to have).  The preacher was cut from a cookie-cutter stereotype, the relationships of Day-Lewis with his \\"son\\" was unbelievable.     The only interesting bit of this movie was learning how dangerous it was to work on oil sites at the turn of the century.
B00NIAHZQ6|5|These worked great and appear to be of better quality than most.
B00IU0M85C|5|Kind of twisted story line with great characters. This is addictive. Also there is humor that's lacking from most TV shows. It doesn't take itself too seriously.
B003TXSF5C|5|The Grand Design details how dependent we are on one another that the theory of relativity explains each human's action with and without other human beings. So unique and dependent on so many factors is life itself it begs the answer that if there is a God for us to find we still are infinitely still too far away to know the answer. So, the Grand Design is still beyond our reach.

Other family members browsed through the book as well and were extremely impressed.  We would highly recommend &#34;Humans of New York&#34; to everyone not only as a &#34;table top&#34; book but to build good conversations among guests and visitors who page through it.
B0015DROBO|3|I enjoyed reading Stieg Larsson books.  I am on my third and final book by him.  I will miss reading more written by him.  I have one comment about these books.  I treat my Kindle the way I treated my books.  They did not look like I have even read them because I have respect for my books.  My Kindle however downloaded this series to my Kindle with many highlights in the series.  I don't know if this can be corrected but if so please do so.

006202406X|2|Sigh, I really wanted to like this book. I read the other two because I couldn't put them down. I continued reading this book because I wanted to read the conclusion of the other two books- but honestly a lot of the time if felt almost like /work/ to read the book because it was so boring!<br /><br />Roth's said that she didn't know where the books were headed when she started writing them- and it seems like she really didn't have any idea at all! When you write a book like this with a big reveal, you have to at least have some idea of what's going on the entire series so that the big reveal actually makes sense. The entire book just felt really lazy. Also, I agree with everyone that Four and Tris's voice sounded EXACTLY THE SAME. When I first started reading the book, I was hoping she'd do something interesting with the two voices...but nope. There was only one reason she needed his narration...<br /><br />As for the ending- I'm going to go against popular opinion here. I thought the ending was actually the most interesting and well written parts of the book. Was it necessary, did it make sense for the situation to even happen, etc etc? Nope! But it's the only part of the book where I actually wanted to keep reading (the last 40 pages or so). The only part of the book where I felt some emotion. Only part where the character acted like the character would in that situation (though the character probably should never have been in that situation to begin with, because it made no sense, but I digress).<br /><br />Basically, I think the only plan Roth had for the end of the series was that one big part. She didn't really think out any other part of the book. So save yourself some time, read the last 50 pages of the book (don't worry, it won't make any more sense what's going on if you actually read the whole thing), feel really sad, and move on.

B0080R7P8A|5|By the third or fourth play of this collection, I was blown away. The sound throughout is fantastic; the material stellar; and the story behind the preparation fantastic - just think of those tapes in that closet and the way they were originally recorded and then cared for 40+ years later! (There's lots of info about that in the booklet) Just about everything positive you could say about this release is in reality a success, with just a few things you have to take in context to be in full appreciation.<br /><br />The editing and track sequencing are utterly superb. I've heard a lot of the unreleased Can film music on a bootleg called Soundtracks 2, and it sounded like senseless garbage (complete with dialog from the German movies). Virtually all of the good bits however found their way into the longer 'suite' tracks released here, and gel together as seamless compositions ready for proper release. Well done Jono Podmore!<br /><br />I have to oppose a few things mentioned about The Lost Tapes in professional reviews: A) the live tracks don't make for a strong conclusion to the set. B) the live tracks were unreleased before this set.<br /><br />Not true. \\"Mushroom\\" from 1972, at the end of disc 3, is one of Can's finest live moments. (This is my opinion after listening to some 37 Can concert recordings) I think the track, along with \\"One More Night\\", is a great way to end of career-spanning set. At the same time, \\"Mushroom\\" is a redundant release here. It can be found on disc 2 of Tago Mago re-release from 2011. \\"Networks of Foam\\" is also a repeat. It can be found on Live 1971-1977 in shorter form (as \\"Kata Kong\\").<br /><br />Switching back and forth from studio to live tracks and hearing the same pieces crop again with different titles can be awkward. Trust me, in this case however, it works! That it does has just about everything to do with Irmin Schmidt's track sequencing, which fleshes out Can's narrative so intelligently. It's easy for a lot of the studio tracks to seem like remixes of familiar tracks from Soundtracks, Ege Bamyasi, and Landed. It's not such a problem though, because of their high quality and (in not all, but most cases) considerable difference. I would actually take \\"Desert\\" over \\"Soul Desert\\" if I had to choose. It's quieter, and as much or even more spine-tingling.<br /><br />I think The Lost Tapes is closest in feel to Unlimited Edition. The pieces are of a scattered chronology, yet uniform strength. What's unprecedented with The Lost Tapes is that it pays homage to the Mooney-era that's relatively large. Five tracks on the set have Damo's voice, yet there are seven with Mooney. The ones with Malcolm are not only that good, they cover all facets of Can's intricate outlook in the late nineteen-sixties. It makes the music collected on Delay 1968 seem very one-sided by comparison.to seem like remixes of familiar tracks from Soundtracks, Ege Bamyasi, and Landed.

B009NQKPUW|2|Let me sum this ridiculous movie up for you and thereby save you time and money.<br /><br />**** (SPOILERS) ****<br /><br />Some people go to space to find the \\"Engineers\\" that created us.<br />They find some goo. One guy unintentionally eats the goo.<br />He has sex with a women. Within one day of sex, she has a squid for a baby; the baby was removed by C-section.<br />The squid-baby grows really large and kills an Engineer (who was trying to kill the squid-baby's mother).<br />An alien jumps out of the Engineers stomach.<br />The end.<br /><br />The effects were cheesy (you will laugh at the \\"scary\\" scenes) and the story was poorly written.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the exploration of (what I thought was) the central topic: mankind's creation.  But there was none of that. At the end there were no answers to the big questions of life, just a set-up for a sequel.

B004X80HEE|5|FROM BEGINNING TO END (Do Começo ao Fim) is the work of writer/director Aluzio Abranches who was born and raised in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He graduated in Economics before going to the London International Film School, in 1983. His first feature-film, 'Um Copo de C&oacute;lera' (1999) was acclaimed in several international film festivals. In 2002 his second feature-film, As três Marias (The Three Marias) also was selected to various festivals abroad. His latest movie, 'Do Começo ao Fim' (From Beginning to End) tells a story about two male half-brothers who fall in love. The movie caused tremendous controversy as some people loved the delicate relationship between them and others who were outraged by the suggestion of incest. Nevertheless, it is undeniable it was groundbreaking for the homosexual Brazilian cinematography, being selected to over 25 international film festivals, many of them dedicated to the gay pride and film production.<br /><br />Though the feelings of viewers continues to be quite mixed, hopefully in time the film as an art work will be better appreciated.  It is an exquisite study of family in a different light than any other film has probed.  Julieta (J&uacute;lia Lemmertz) is currently married to Alexandre (F&aacute;bio Assunção) and they have a child Thom&aacute;s who according to the narrator - the half brother Francisco from Julieta's previous marriage to Pedro (Jean Pierre Noher) - was born with his eyes closed and kept them closed except for looking at his new brother.  Into this loving atmosphere the two brothers are close, enjoying each other's company in play and adventures and proximity. Francisco as a child is played by Lucas Cotrim and Thom&aacute;s as a child is played by Gabriel Kaufmann. Thom&aacute;s idolizes his big brother and Francisco looks to Thom&aacute;s for secure love.  The boys visit Pedro (Francisco's father) in Buenos Aires at Christmas and Pedro discusses with Julieta that he is concerned that the boys are too close, a fact that Julieta acknowledges but assures Pedro that this is normal in boys their age. At home in Rio de Janeiro Alexandre poses the same concern, but the two young boys are so happy and successful in school and sports that the subject is dropped.  Pedro dies, then Julieta dies, and the two now grown young lads have only their shared father Alexandre to parent them. As young very handsome, athletic men Francisco (now played by João Gabriel Vasconcellos) and Thom&aacute;s ( Rafael Cardosa) are left alone in their home and their relationship deepens into a physical one. The lads deeply love each other and their physical love is as wondrously portrayed as their love as half brothers.  They exchange rings. They both are dedicated swimmers, but Thom&aacute;s is better and is offer to go to Russia to train for the Olympics.  The idea of separation deeply troubles them both, but Francisco's love for Thom&aacute;s sees the importance to his brothers career and off Thom&aacute;s goes to Russia.  While the lads are separated they yearn for each other: Francisco attempts to assuage his longing with a young girl but his commitment to Thom&aacute;s is stronger.  The film ends in a statement of commitment and love between these two extraordinary men.<br /><br />The physical aspects of the relationship are beautifully captured in the sensitive cinematography by Ueli Steiger: the acts are passionate but visually subtle.  The musical score by Andr&eacute; Abujamra adds another realm of power to the story's character.  Each of the actors in the film is excellent. It is rare that broken family stories have been shared with such grace and delicacy. And both Vasconcellos and Cardoso seem to have a fine career ahead of them.<br /><br />FROM BEGINNING TO END should not be labeled as a gay film even though it allows the viewer to see the power of same sex relationships in a beautifully described new light.  This is, simply, a fine film and Aluzio Abranches deserves kudosfor his accomplishment.  Grady Harp, April 12

B00000DQSV|3|....but not by much. The Durans -- now down to three of the original -- now have former Chic man Nile Rodgers as producer, and his influence comes through on the title track (probably the best tune on the album), as well as &quot;Meet El Presidente&quot; and &quot;Skin Trade.&quot; &quot;American Science&quot; is also surprisingly pleasant (I really dig the driving bass underbeat), but beyond these they're ain't much that stands out.
B000BT97AO|4|As numerous viewrs have said, the film is visually stunning.  But.  I didn't feel much emotional connection with the characters, withthe exception of Stephanie Leonides who plays Helena and does a pretty good job setting up her character prior to falling into the fantasy sequence that is the heart of the film.      But the other characters just didn't touch me, and it took forever to understand what was supposed to be going on in the the fantasy seaquence.  The commentayr on the DVD is instructive - originally there was a five minute opening seaquence tht set up the entire premise for the fantasy portion of the film, but that was cut after feedback from virtually everyone who previewed the film because no one could relate emotionally to the main characters.  So instead the film is introduce with what another reviewer has characterized (not inaccurately) as a TV soap opera seqauence.    I also have a major grip with the musical score.  To my ears the music did little to enhance the film or create an emotional connection with its narrative or characters. From the commentary I gather that the composrer and musicians are major talents but as a film score it fell realy flat and in fact I often fund the musical score to be an intrusive annoyance.     So now to my point - despite these criticisms I beliefve that this is a film that deserves repeated viewing, once with sound on just to figure out what is going on and then as a \\"silent film\\" with the subtitles on and the sound muted.  You may miss an occasional bit of humor but you will be rewarded with a unique visual experience.  Som eo fthe characters, VAlentine in particular, may come off bbetter in the \\"silent\\" version.    Because this film lacks the emotion connection of for examle Wizard of Oz and Pans Labyrint (two films with comparable fantasy elements), 4 stars might eem a little high.  But it has such elements of greatness that I think it deserves that rating.

B000002J23|5|That's right, this is an album with only one brief guitar solo (on &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;).  Yet, it is one of the most solid rock albums I've ever heard.  I love all six tracks.  It's amazing how well this  one-time Yes lineup wrote and recorded their music.  Geoff Downes gives the  album a more up-to-date (well, 80's) sound with his synthesizers...but with  genuine melodic feel, and wonderfully gels with Howe and Squire's guitars.   Alan White, whom I never cared much for, must have enjoyed playing the  drums and various percussion on Drama - quite aggressive!  The singing is  as good as with Jon Anderson...granted Trevor has a different feel, perhaps  less emotional than Jon, but he's perfect for Drama.  Steve Howe's guitar  sound is multi-faceted and strong yet with a touch of restraint for the  good of the songs.  Squire's bass knocks the wind out of you!  The lyrics?   Well, I can't quite follow them all, but I don't see how ANY die-hard Yes  fan can possibly criticize them for that!

B00005JLXE|4|I agree with the loyal Daredevil comic book fans who say this movie is only a commercial tribute to the blind Superhero. The Daredevil character on film is only slightly related to the powerful comic book hero. This is unfortunate because the non-comic book fans would think the two characters are the same. I admit it is difficult to create the complexity of comic book heroes in only two hours. For the film maker, what needs to be done in two hours is make a profit. If the profits are good then a sequel will follow. To do this there is nothing like exploiting a successful Marvel comic book action hero like Daredevil. <br />If the movie Daredevil is compared independently of the comic book Daredevil character then I would have to admit that the movie was worth it. Jennifer Garner made this movie worthwhile with a look, which can only be described as \\"dangerously sexy.\\" I am not surprised that her character, Electra, is being given her own starring role in an upcoming movie. <br />The movie is visually dark but still stunning at times. In some cases the scenes were a bit too dark and some might even say depressing. The darkness is in keeping with the comic book feel but certainly not the depression. <br />This movie is worth a look and even a DVD purchase but it is not the classic that I hoped it would have been.

B000002JSN|5|One of the greatest rock albums EVER!<br /><br />This is Led Zeppelin at their prime: stunning vocals, awe-inspiring guitars and basses, and captivating drums. The songs are masterful, first-rate, timeless, [other descriptive terms that I can't think of at the moment]. \\"Custard Pie,\\" \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" and of course, \\"Kashmir\\" are my favorites on this album, while the rest are still excellent from beginning to end. \\"The Rover,\\" \\"In the Light,\\" \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" \\"Night Flight\\" and others would surely please almost all hard rock fans in the world. And I mean it. This is a milestone in 70's Rock 'N' Roll. What worries me, however, that there could be a possibility that Physical Graffiti could be forgotten a few decades later, due to the fact that the music of today caters mainly to the pop crowd. I hope that doesn't happen, and I hope more people over the years will listen to rock music (whether it be classic, heavy metal, progressive, or whatever). In the meantime, Physical Graffiti is a masterpiece, and I'm so glad that I've had a chance to delve into Led Zeppelin's music.<br /><br />Grade: 10/10

B00005JM20|3|OK, I admit it, I am a huge Rowan Atkinson fan.  Over here, in the States, he is known mostly for being Mr. Bean and has made a nice character acting career playing loveable idiots.  However, I like him best when he is playing smart, evil characters like Balckadder (one of the best shows ever!).  <br />As Johnny English, he is again a loveable idiot - this time working for the British Secret Service.  They could have found a better plot for a movie as James Bond spoofs have been done to death by this point.  But, as a home video movie, I have to admit that I laughed aloud in places.  Basically, if you are a fan of Atkinson (or British humor in general) you will be pleasantly diverted by this movie.  If you are ignorant of British comedy, don't start with this movie or you will simply not get it.
B003F76HFC|2|This book started out with an interesting enough plot.  Unfortunately, the main character needed to be more developed in order to be appealing (her main characteristic seems to be that she is really nice and sweet). The characters in the book have deep rooted problems and in the end everything wraps up WAY too neatly.  I bought this book to read at the beach knowing it would be a lighter read but unfortunately I was still disappointed by the way it ended.

As far as an action movie, bad boy, crime movie goes, it is ok.Guys will like it that's for sure. I have to agree the cast is superb. I was really surprised at the gathering of wonderful talent in this movie. I was surprised because the script is an odd choice for some of the greatness of the actors.    Brad Pitt is a hoot! There are some good laughs in this movie. Very violent though, beware. Still I don't get the appeal with all the other mafia type movies out there. Can someone help me out here?

6305263248|4|I dont consider myself a great movie critic.. I never fill these things out .. I think in this case potential DVD buyers (DVD only) need a warning. If you use a DVD player for your tv set you shouldnt have a problem with  this. If you use a DVD-ROM drive for your PC you WILL encounter some very  annonying and pesky problems. 1. There is an included software DVD decoder  on the disc.. this is a great idea imho.. but the autoplay feature on this  is extremely slow and annoying. I advise you to DISable autoplay for your  drive. Every time you put this DVD in, or even hit play on your dvd  software, it launches the autorun.. It takes about 30 seconds just to bring  up one window with two buttons on it. It has even locked my system a few  times.. I advise you to NOT install the software it prompts you aobut even  if you do not have a dvd player. All the other features of the DVD are VERY  nice. I loved the feature-length commentary by the director (John  Frankenheimer), and the alternate ending was interesting as well (glad they  cut it out tho =P ). Let me say again this is a great movie.. just horrible  coding and lack of thought went into the software included on the DVD. (I  filled out the little customer response card that came with it.. and  attached a letter informing them of my disapproval of the aforementioned  things.. you should do the same) Sorry to take so long, enjoy the movie

0679720200|5|Often those works of literature that are labelled as classics by the cultural and academic establishment are simply not accessible to the lay public. \\"The Outsider\\" (or \\"The Stranger\\") by Albert Camus is an exception. This is a very easy to read book and yet it is not so easy to read. Camus lays his themes bare in a simple plot about a very ordinary man. Yet beneath the surface of ordinariness lies an extraordinary story. I believe that its impact as a philosophical and moral tale owes much to the raw and unpretentious presentation of the author in this case. <br /> <br />I shan't reveal the plot yet I will say that other reviewers' appraisals of the protagonist Meursault are interesting to say the least. To claim that he is unlikeable or evil is short-sighted and ultimately untrue in my opinion. In fact I felt compassion for Meursault and could identify with some of his psychology, which was brilliantly portrayed by Camus. One of the things that struck me most profoundly about Meursault is his rather dry penchant for calling a spade a spade and telling life like he sees it. He agrees to help his neighbour Raymond, for example, because he sees no reason not to. He is a loner but fundamentally a decent person. He is an outsider to social conventions and in many respects I applaud him for being so. I for one do not consider him guilty of anything other than being true to himself. Ultimately this is one reason why this book is so thoroughly thought-provoking. It will keep you thinking about it long after you have put it down.

Unfortunately it cannot compete with \\"the Swarm\\" in any way because things just get too crazy, there are too many twists.<br />Everything is just confusing. I didnt enjoy this book as much as i have enjoyed Angels and Demon.<br />If you really want a phantastic read with lots of knowledge and a great plot then read \\"The Swarm\\" by Frank Schaetzing. Its an amazing book.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Awesome game totally worth it! Totally agree with the others! Awesome game and definitely a great game! Awesome get it if you read this it's awesome!!!
0385493800|5|This story is (I think) quite a change from Grisham's other books, but nonetheless completely absorbing. An attorney who has been in and out of rehab for alcohol and drug abuse is sent to a remote area somewhere in  Brazil to locate a young woman working as a missionary with an indian  tribe, who has just become the sole beneficiary of a multi-billion dollar  estate. In the process, the attorney faces many dangers and his own  mortality, eventually coming to grips with his life and his problems,  probably for the first time. He comes back to civilization a totally  changed man.  Grisham's treatment of the subject of Christianity and  committing one's life for God's service is honest and sincere, and  thought-provoking. I finished this book feeling tremendously satisfied.

B00G24KKAS|5|Enjoy watching on Amazon (no commercials). Maintaining ones sanity in an apocalypse (especially a zombie apocalypse) would be difficult at best.  It's always interesting to see whose going to have the next mental breakdown and it looks like Carol is the one.  I am surprised her character has lasted this long, but who knows, she may recover or it may be her demise.  Good suspense.
B009OYSFDM|4|By grounding the traditional Green Arrow mythology in the real world (no super powers), the CW's Arrow successfully seeks to modernize the comic giant for a new audience. Stephen Amell's multi-layered performance as the titular deeply wounded archer-for-justice is compelling, and the rest of the show’s actors have been able to create complex characters you can care about. An excellent first season of what I hope will be a long-running series.
B00005QZ7U|5|I first heard of this film, on like, May or April 2001, and i saw some clips in \\"Access Hollywood\\", and it had a stunning cinematography and great production design, unfourtanely i didn't catch it in theaters, so i waited for the DVD, i brought it the first day, and i just setted up the DTS track, and well for the first minute i was totally hooked!, the story is about Christian a 1900 writer who visits France to become part of the bohemian revolution (i am not sure if this was true), he meets at his apartment five bohemian revoloutinaries, one of them is Toulouse Lautrec, then they discover that he is the perfect chance to make the first bohemian show, then they go to the Moulin Rouge, where Christian falls in love with Satine, the star of the Moulin Rouge, and after a really comical sequence, Harold Zidler, who is the leader of the Moulin Rouge and the Duke decide to invest on the show,but the Duke wants Satine, and this is where the problem starts, and i won't give it out the rest, that's up to you, but of course, the film does have its minor flaws, for example that thing that Satine has to sleep with the  Duke in order to save Christian's bohemian ending in the play, it's just corny, but still acceptable, the acting between the actors is great, no one fails, Nicole Kidman truly does deserve her Oscar nomination, everyone is perfect, the cinematography is wonderful, it could dizzy you, specially if you have a very big widescreen TV like me, anyways let me get more in depth.<BR>PLOT:****:Well, it seems that the plot is a little bit thin, but still great.<BR>SCREENPLAY:****1/2, wonderful, except for the Duke and Satine thing i mentioned before, it has a great poetic dialouge, and it avoids most of the typical Hollywood cliches.<BR>ACTING:*****:As i said before, there is a great chemistry between Nicole  Kidman and Ewan McGregor, everyone is perfect.<BR>CINEMATOGRAPHY:Stunning, and it truly does do a great service to the film.<BR>SOUNDTRACK: ****1/2: I liked all thesongs, the problem is that the soundtrack in some songs sound a bit too syntetize, i know they used keyboards to do the music,many other people do it great, but this time was a bit annoying, instead of making it sound like remaking the song, it sounds like if it's parodizing it.<br />Well,thats it, i truly did loved this film, i recommend it for ages 12 and older, there is some sexual content,but don't worry there is nothing wild or porno you might see
B000067CPX|5|Yeah, OK, \\"maturing\\" is a bit of a dirty word - not one you might like to see associated with the Chilis, but I just can't think of a better one.  <br />Like many people, I was enraptured by the energy of the early Chilis - and perhaps like many others, I was a little disappointed with thier work after Mothers Milk. But not, I suspect, for the same reasons as many. <br />It wasn't that I felt the Chilis were selling out on cuts like \\"BloodSugarSexMagik\\" - I felt that they just weren't going far enough! Adolescent sexual energy is all very well, but after a while gets a little boring. I lost interest in this band that wasn't rekindled until I heard \\"Scar Tissue\\", which I felt showed increasing depth and adventure. I am glad (yes there is a point to all this preamble) to see that direction and energy maintained on \\"By The Way\\". The lyrics are not so goofy, in fact very acute. The musicianship is a lot more understated, which is great. i used to love hearing Frusciante's and Flea's virtuosity, but on this album they prove that understatement has as much - if not more - power than flash and glitter! And Anthony Kiedis' singing is constantly improving. <br />All the tracks are great, although the best for me are \\"This Is The Place\\" - a menacing piece where Kiedis basically rips his heart out and offers it warts and all for our perusal - \\"Don't Forget Me\\", where the menace gets even more menacing, with some of the darkest and broodiest poetry I've heard in a while, \\"Midnight\\" - great chorus - \\"Minor Thing\\", which simply soars at the end and the rousing, superb closer \\"Venice Queen\\", a lament that pulses with restrained energy and power. Restraint is the key word for this album. Sometimes less is more.
B00007L4OM|4|This is a unique film--a detective movie with heart.  Jean Reno is excellent as the detective who travels to Japan on a police case and ends up enriching his life.  Also, the film is set in France and Japan, a welcome change from the usual LA or NY.  This movie is a definite &#34;must&#34; for Jean Reno fans and for everyone who likes films that end on an upbeat note.
1847940684|5|Only halfway through and already I know this will sit beside Leadership Pipeline as one of the business books I reread at least every 6 months.
B00IX9UTLU|4|Pretty typical romance series. Rich guy, pretty girl, secret pasts. Entertaining, which is the point of these types of books.
B00KMX5V8G|3|After a while it gets monotous
B003LQ3YXU|5|I'm fairly new to &#34;Who&#34; but this is here I started. I have since caught up through &#34;The Time of the Doctor&#34; and have also gone back to learn more about the classic &#34;Who&#34;. I have since re-watched this season and though special effects and some aliens can seem campy at first sight, I still feel this series is worth watching. Watch especially if you intend to watch 'Torchwood'.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book I rate FIVE stars because she leads you farther into the book and keeps you on the edge of your seat even if  you have seen the movie.  If you seen the movie or have not read the book.  I would recommend this book for 11 or 10 and up
B000059HAI|5|I have recently purchased a DVD player and although I have had the VHS version of \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" since it was released I now own the DVD. I also own the DVD of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" I feel that the computer graphics used to generate the attack scenes in \\"Pearl\\" are something that can't be equaled and must be seen to be believed, \\"Tora\\" give a much more detailed and accurate account of the events surrounding December 7, 1941. Since the first time that I saw Tora Tora Tora, I have always been fascinated by the degree of knowledge that the members of the military community in Washington D.C. had of the \\"Surprise\\" attack by The Japanese Empire. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in the events of World War II.
B009UX2YAC|4|It's fun but not when you get killed with 2 lives
B005ZOBNOI|5|Even knowing this was a book with no happily ever after I still find it a wonderful story about how true love, however fleeting, is worth it
B005L38QK2|5|It's lovely
B005ZOBNOI|4|Good writing and a poignant story make<br />For an incredible book. Thoroughly enjoyed it and have already recommended it to others!
B008ALA6DW|5|not much to add, it's an adapter, works fine.  If you can overlook the fact that it's just one more way for Apple to gouge a little more cash out of you...
B00SI7GCJK|1|Truly Awful.  Somewhere in this mess, that is easily more than an hour too long (doesn't anybody ever question these directors anymore...can't a good editor hit them aside the head and say Cut It Down), there is a good (not great) story of the love of a father for his daughter that solves a question and saves a species.  A promising start just drags and drags and drags.  Looking back on the movie, it is astounding that messages that could have been conveyed in one scene are allowed to just keep going until you are ready to cry MERCY.  A crucial bedroom scene is so poorly acted that it takes one out of the movie, and it never recovers.  Anne Hathaway in particular does such a poor job that every scene with her is torture.  You just want it to MOVE, and it doesn't.  There are two terrific scenes (water planet, and Matt Damon's goodbye), but it is not enough to ever recommend this movie.  It was so shockingly bad, from a director I had previously admired.  This is just bloated ego-tripping babble.
B00LP9EE1G|3|Interesting premise, but a bit chaotic in its cinematography.  The acting was good at times but not always.
B00CWY76CC|3|Fun but short. Light challenges that are more clever than hard but entertaining nonetheless. Definitely worth a play at this price.
B000LPR9ZS|4|nice item. price is good. couldnt have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.
B001KQKC0Q|5|Gonna make this short and sweet.  WoW! I have been a Nickelback fan for a long time and this band keeps getting better and better. Their music is raw! WoW!
B00004RYZT|5|I love Rammstein and their live shows are hands down the best ever, even better than KISS. The music is the best and their stage presence is uncerpast. Buy it if you want to see how a real concert really is.
B00JB3MVCW|1|Not into this movie
B00A8MGLAI|5|I imagine there will be many 5-star and 1-star reviews of this movie.  It is wildly ambitious, unconventional and occasionally flawed, and it will evoke strong positive and negative reactions from the film going public.<br /><br />Because it explores what some may consider to be weighty or arcane existential themes, and does so in a non-linear fashion, many viewers will find Cloud Atlas confounding, boring even tedious... unless they soldier through the first hour and begin to feel the stories coalesce into a master symphony.<br /><br />I had some issues with the make-up and stilted dialogue, but after seeing the movie a couple times now, I chose to overlook the flaws because the movie is so mesmerizing from both a cinematographic and emotional perspective.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's movies, so if you happen to like Kubrick, I think you will also enjoy Cloud Atlas.  If not, then you might want to stay away.  Regardless, if you approach this movie with an open mind and heart, I think it's thematic and storytelling power will wash over you.<br /><br />I loved it.
B000053VAF|5|Ok I wanted to remain silent on commenting on DOGMA until the special edition DVD came out. Well now it's here, FINALLY! And I am prepared to comment...<br />Now, in my humble opinion Kevin Smith is truly one of those filmmakers that really doesn't give himself the credit he richly deserves. I work in a video store, so, with the benefits I get to rent movies for free, and after a year or so I've seen great film (Smith's films included), but unfortunately, I also see films that are unoriginal, uninspired, and lacking substance (40% of those belonging to either Martin Lawrence or Adam Sandler). But Kevin Smith somehow manages to make something that tickles and stimulates your subconsious and makes you feel intellectually invigorated. Starting with &quot;CLERKS,&quot; the raw, gritty, and realistic look at the minimum wage hellholes that decorate our suburbs. Then the underappreciated &quot;MALLRATS&quot; a film that provoked watchers to stop a think about the things we typically never think about (i.e. the overpowering coital abilities of Superman). Third was the brutally honest and deeply emotional dramadey &quot;CHASING AMY&quot; a film that pointed out how important is is to focus on the now and also to trust your heart.<br />And then Smith's latest opus DOGMA.<br />Not since Albert Brooks' comedy &quot;MOTHER&quot; has there been a movie that gave me the desire to sit down and privately evaluate where I stand in my own life and the way I see the world, and more importantly next world. In total honestly, the people that shunned this movie needed to look past the ugly shell and see the deeper motivation of &quot;DOGMA.&quot; The implications laid forward by this film are really the most intelligent observations I've ever heard, and when I thought about them to myself I realized how much sense they've made to me. It now makes sense to me that God could be a woman, that Jesus was black and that these facts were omitted in order to hide the hardcore truth. Come to think of it those people have a mild similarity to Disney (who turned it's back on this film) obviously they don't want their audience to actually think! (Hence the succes of Pocahontas.) Fact is all of those films that dared to make the audience feel, have been given nothing but trouble (Just look at what happened to &quot;BRAZIL&quot;).<br />But Now I'll comment on the comedy and performances. I still state that Kevin Smith is still the only person who manages to make curse words sound natural and evenly balances with Smith's intelligent, and witty writing. His immortal characters Jay and Silent Bob, upon their hilariously heroic entrance seemed like an addition that would end up clashing with the idea of the film, but soon you begin to welcome their presence into the proceedings. The material as well is fresh, original, and risky. Not since &quot;Monty Python's Life of Brian&quot; was there a comedy that dared to use the gospels as a platform for off-the-wall hilarity. Only in this one, the humor is natural and is perfectly in character for this film, aided in no small part by brilliant acting. We truly see a versatility in Chris Rock we never thought was there. Damon and Affleck obviously have no trouble working off each other. Salma Hayek has successfully managed to say &quot;I'm sorry for my useless character in Wild, Wild, West,&quot; and played a role that always puts a smile on my face. Jason Lee is also a diabolical delight (as usual)as our villain Azrael. Alan Rickman is hilariously british, as Metatron, and our heroine Linda Fiorentino makes you genuinely feel for her as the film progresses. <br />But you get even more of these feelings as you watch the extras on this fully loaded Special Edition DVD. supplying us with with over 100 minutes of deleted footage. You must definitely watch the flick before you watch these scenes, so you can absorb the scenes. The scenes are more interesting to watch on their own. I agree with Kevin Smith that if the film had notbeen cut it would've been WAAAAAY too long, and fact is comedy was not made for 3 1/4 hours. But watching these scenes alone make some of the motivations of the film more clear to me. Plus, add Two great Commentaries from cast and crew and then you'll get a welcome addition to the View Askew DVD collection.<br />In conclusion, DOGMA has meant alot to me on a personal level. Because now, I've been provoked to give my faith a final evaluation and finally have thoughts of my own, and the fact that it's a comedy makes it moreso satisfying. You just don't get those feelings with a movie featuring a moron yelling nonsensical gibberish for an hour and a half.
B00A8ECU24|5|It's amazing for anyone but it's a time consumer
B007MJT1K2|3|It was fun to watch even through I was not familiar with the earlier presentations
B005LAII9O|4|With all the bad publicity garnered by Oliver Stones latest epic, I would say see for yourself and make your own decisions.  The movie draws you in and is another tour de force effort from the controversial director of Platoon, JFK and Natural Born Killers.  It's never boring, that's for sure and the cast is A+!
B00BKTFABE|1|U can not take regular pictures w this camera u can only take your own picture.Camera does not face out. I should have bought an ipad. Very disgusted.
B00FRCNNVY|5|I really enjoy Anoushka's sitar playing, While she is not quite as accomplished as her father (who is?), she is certainly a very talented musician. The percussion on the CD is excellent. The songs with her sister, Nora Jones, are fantastic.
0345535529|5|Catching up to 20 years of writing - the books provide a greater insight to each character.. Damn - Martin is genius!!
B00B4Z5J92|5|Incredibly interesting history told with passion and love. Not to mention that, the music is fantastic all across the board!
B0094M2V7U|5|Love this movie and the others need to put the other ones on prime
B00FATEJYE|4|Fun game but will give your fingers tired.
B001BTG3OQ|5|I'm a wedding photographer so I needed a good flash. This is THE flash to get if you're a Nikon owner. The controls are great. It can work in SU remote flash mode, which is a great feature. Most of the time I use it on manual to avoid the pre-flash that all of the automatic modes use to predict the necessary final flash output.     If you're in the business there is no point buying anything less.
B00957T6X6|4|Good storyline but the derogatory way the females are portrayed were so off-putting and the fact that anything that moves is edible was quite gross. I had to grit my teeth and continue reading because the storyline itself is captivating.
B0000AQS0F|5|Firefly defies classification by genre.  Each episode is packed to the brim with exciting (but believable) action sequences, heart-wrenching (but never sappy or maudlin) drama, clever dialogue (that never tries too hard to be so), more laugh-out-loud moments than your average episode of Friends/Raymond/W&G/KoQ/etc., and absolutely breathtaking (but never gratuitous) effects. <br /> <br />Though a science fiction western by setting, Firefly never panders to and is never limited by that framework.  Those designations merely provide a unique and relevant context for the series which is nonetheless character and story driven.  Episodes are never about fanciful technological mumbo jumbo, unlike standard Trek/Gate/Bab5/BG fare.  Every episode is instead an engaging look into the lives of human beings, always life-sized, with human problems that submit to human solutions, all the while taking place in a world lovingly and meticulously crafted in astoundingly intimate detail. <br /> <br />The acting is incredible, and the chemistry between the actors is as authentic as any I've ever seen.  The writing is superbly fresh and compelling.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and seductive, providing perfect ambience and a stark contrast to external views of the spaceship where the main characters live, which are always perfectly silent.  (No show or movie I've ever seen, before or since, has gotten that right.) <br /> <br />Firefly is, by acclamation, the greatest television show ever to be canceled.  I don't hesitate to call it both the best science fiction series and the best western series in the history of television.  Personally, Firefly is in my top two favorite TV shows of all time, the other being Seinfeld, with the order depending on my mood.  If you haven't seen Firefly, you are missing out on one of the finest TV shows ever made.
B00A8KJN8M|5|Great show. Wish it would have lasted more then 3 seasons. Love the brass and the ingenious of it all. Great show!
B00IX035QA|4|Cute game, loved it for the kids...  Huge fantasy RPG fan so I found this to be a good intro type game.
B00E0FI39G|5|I love this actor... One of my best actors on the tv series the walking dead... I'll enjoy the doll.. Just to look at on my dresser.. Thank you so much...
B009NXD6JM|1|It's a bit like watching a crackhead babble on for two hours.  I'd rather watch Miley Cyrus twerk for that long. Zero character development, the characters aren't really believable.  Maybe interesting to see how things were back then.<br /><br />Hepburn manages an American /  Southern accent in the beginning but just totally reverts to her British accent later.  The portrayal of Asians I found distasteful, but interesting to see how far we've come.<br /><br />Otherwise I thought Amazon Prime HD delivery is excellent as always, and the Colorizing pretty good too.
B000MR9D5E|5|A fantastic collection of nature's wonders. I wonder how the pictures were taken with such content. Don't miss it!
B003XF1XOQ|5|It was a very satisfying ending to the series.  It grabs you<br />at the start and keeps the excitement of the hunger games alive.<br />I don't think it should be two movies, but that is another story!
B000002H33|5|Alright, I bought this album last month, with no Metallica music on my iPod except for 'Whiskey in the Jar' from Garage inc. It was only fiteen bucks, so I grabbed it. I popped it in and immediatly switched to Master of Puppets, the title track. After that, this has been in my CD player quite a bit(along with Led Zeppelin:Early Days and Latter Days and Black Rain). This is a great album. There should be no doubt in your mind whether to pickk it up or not. A recurring theme in the tracks are control and manipulation, but they're diverse enough so that it's more than one song. The liner notes have the lyrics inside, so you can sing along(good luck, these suckers are fast...) And now, time for a breakdown of the songs: <br /> <br />Battery: Great. Starts out pretty mellow, but gets heavier and proceeds to beat you into submission. <br /> <br />Master of Puppets: Great. Starts out heavy, then gets kinda' funky in the middle, and just when you think it's over, it punches you in the face and keeps marching. <br /> <br />The Thing The Should Not Be: Crap. This should be called The Song the Should Not Be. <br /> <br />Welcome Home(Sanitarium): Great. Pretty mellow, but like the mental patients it's about, it rises, stronger and stronger. <br /> <br />Leper Messiah: Great. <br /> <br />Orion: Great, and instrumental. <br /> <br />Damage Inc.: Alright. <br /> <br />I think that'sit, but if it isn't, I'll edit this review. Also, this album was number one in the 500 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of all time, so it must be doing something right. :)
B009ZQC7MY|5|Excellent series!!  I can't stop watching it.  I am ready for Season 4 to go on Prime. I t is entertaining and realistic.
B00FMT553G|2|What was shipped was almost a year out of date.  The result is that all of the pictures have a strong red color shift.  Contrast was low.  Unlike the original Spectra film, it takes about 30 minutes to develop an image.  It remains somewhat light sensitive until development has completed.  I have no way to know if the results are any better with fresh film.    (6/7?2015) I took a chance and ordered some film directly from Impossible Project (Manufacturer).  The results are better with fresh film.  The red cast takes a couple of days to go away with fresh film but it does.  Don't just the final color and contrast after 30 minutes because it seems to improve within a few days.    If you are not constrained to an old polaroid Spectra or 600 series camera, you will get much better instant picture results from one of the new Fuji instant cameras and its media.  Otherwise, you may do well enough with the Impossible Project product if you order directly from the manufacturer.  Of note,  the shipment I received had one pack that was a couple of months out of date and one that expires in October (June order).
B00TOXJ6HM|4|This is a must have in homes and schools. Brilliant resource to reach out to children who may have difficulties at some point and time in their lives.
B0055S348W|5|This saved me one late night when I had to print some documents but could not do it from my computer.  Highly recommend!
B0058YPG1G|5|Hell yes I will purchase the crap out  of Breaking Bad! Nail biters, drama, comedy, \\"holy s*** I can't believe that just happened\\" moments on a frequent basis! Watch it! NOW!
0345803485|1|This book was absolutely horrible. I felt like I was trapped in a maze of poorly written repetitive crap. How can people co-sign this crap!!!!!
B005S9EJ14|5|Love Maggie Smith and Judy Dench in anything they are in.
B002MQYOFW|5|Love this book. Great story line and each character is amazing. You feel the pain and emotions, great reading material for all ages
B00FAPF5U0|5|A great way to pass time
B0084B5TK8|5|I loved this book. Seeing the different entries and hearing from various characters is what makes the book so good!
B00BPFWZHU|5|This is an honest discussion about human mortality. The book is written as a series of questions and answers between the author, Darrin Mason, and the universe. The &#34;dialogue&#34; model has been around as a form of literature since people have been writing, and I felt it was effectively used here.<br /><br />As with any books on spirituality, the effectiveness of this text will depend on the reader. Either you'll find use in it, or you won't. I believe it's well within the rules to question the conclusions included here (even those attributed to &#34;The Universe&#34;), but there's little doubt that reflecting on the questions in this book will be a step towards spiritual awakening for anyone who stumbles upon these pages. All in all, I thought this was a reflective and interesting read.
B00005K3OT|5|This was a fantastic film, and the music alone is worth seeing it for - nothing like good Gypsy jazz!
1451648537|1|The fact is, this book is nothing more than an overlong, poorly researched, magazine article.  Isaacson blew it, big time.    The book is a collection of misquoted stories and half truths presented as \\"facts.\\"  He spends the book quoting Jobs, then cross examining him with the quotes of others, often missing the salient issues as hand.  Too many of the quotes he relays are misquotes, since they were often drawn from past blogs and articles which give a full and proper context.  His technical knowledge is weak and often faulty, which leads me to suspect the veracity of the rest of the book.  But the worse part is, the book has no soul and doesn't really reveal much new about Steve Jobs.    I read an obit in the New York Times by Steve Jobs' sister Mona Simpson that was moving and shined a light on Steve Jobs.  This is book is cold and poorly researched.  I would love to see Mona write another bio for Steve Jobs.  He deserves it.  A huge missed opportunity.
B000002TPS|1|This CD was Megadeth's attempt at superstardom and it is a pretty weak and lame attempt. The songs are almost pop-rock sounding. There are so many repeated choruses throughout and there aren't really any heavy songs on  here in what used to be the traditional Megadeth style. It is and probably  will always be my least favorite Megadeth CD. Only buy this one if you are  a diehard fan.
B001TH16DI|5|Awesome
B00A6CCF0K|4|A good solid S.K. book<br />Won't let you down
B00ETADXY2|3|I must admit this game is hard for me to do.  I'm just not patient enough I guess, to try & solve the puzzle.  You have to connect all the colors so they disappear & I can't seem to master it.  If you like a challenge, this could be it.
B006VRDZ44|5|Great show.
B004X2M3N8|4|Great show, but, the streaming is not very reliable. Amazon would do well to provide a reliable wasy to down load these type of purchases to standard windows computers.
B0070Y46UY|4|I loved this story! While the author took quite a few liberties in the facts, I very much enjoyed Picsine's story. Although I have never lived an experience quite as traumatic, his character is very relatable. We are faced with doubt, fear, and hopelessness in our every day lives, but it is courage and the will to move forward, and faith in God that gets us last the storm.
B000RF7XYO|4|I really enjoyed the movie when I first saw it and knew nothing of Elizabeth or Tudor history. Now that I'm a Tudor history student I'm very disappointed in the film and am only really able to enjoy it because I previously loved it. I know Michael Hirst knows his Tudor history and I'm sad that this film seems to follow the first season of The Tudors on Showtime. Total disregard for historical events and persons. After The Tudors season one was slaughtered with reviews by people who love Tudor history, season two became way more watchable and I'm hoping that Michael Hirst will rewrite Elizabeth I as the next Showtime series. He can do Elizabeth way more honor than this movie and the The Golden Age.    Overall, good movie if you don't know the history. If you do I'd skip this one because you'll pull your hair out.
B00G4NUQYM|4|This game is good
B008CP93S0|4|Pretty funny movie. I'd buy a bottle of wine and have a friend to banter with though, some parts aren't very funny.
386521584X|5|In 1955 - 1956, Robert Frank (b. 1924), an American photographer born in Switzerland, restlessly crossed the United States several times by car to photograph people and places as he found them. He gradually culled through thousands of photographs to select 83 images for his book, \\"The Americans\\" published initially in Paris in 1958 and in the United States in 1959 by Grove Press. In its initial publication, \\"The Americans\\" sold only 600 copies and received negative reviews.  Its stature has grown with time.  The book is now an American icon.<br /><br />The United States publication of \\"The Americans\\"  included an introduction by Frank's friend, Jack Kerouac, which had earlier been rejected by the French publisher.  Frank did well in asking Kerouac to write the introduction.  Years earlier, Kerouac had made a series of mad journeys across the United States resulting in his famous novel, \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac's book shows more of a romantic spirit than the unsentimental photographs taken by his friend.  Kerouac's introduction captures the spirit of Frank's photographs and of Frank's portrayal of America and offers comments on several individual photos.  It deserves its place as part of Frank's masterwork.<br /><br />In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the book, the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. presented a major exhibition of Frank's work, titled \\"Looking In\\" which included the 83 photographs of \\"The Americans\\" presented in the order of Frank's book, together with other photographs that Frank took, including many photographs he took while he crossed America that did not make their way into the book. I was fortunate to visit the exhibition yesterday to see the photographs first hand.  The National Gallery of Art has also published an encyclopedic version of Frank's book, \\"Looking In\\" which is large and expensive and includes much material in addition to Frank's now iconic collection of 83 photographs.  My review here is of Frank's initial collection with Kerouac's introduction. The book is much less expensive than the reissue, is easier to handle, and provides the original version of Frank's masterpiece.<br /><br />Frank's pictures do indeed draw the view into the scenes he depicts. The photographs include men and women, whites and blacks, rich and poor. The photographs show a certain loneliness, isolation, and unhappiness, regardless of social class. Thus, there are photographs of a lovely  young woman operating an elevator, and of a hard-faced young woman behind a restaurant counter staring fixedly at the viewer. There is a photograph of a wealthy couple in Miami, of lavishly dressed gamblers at a Nevada casino, and of the elegant guests at a New York City cocktail party, drinks in hand, to benefit a school of art. Frank shows a segregated bus in New Orleans, and a scene of a stoic African American nurse holding a white baby in South Carolina. He photographs places, as well, a bar in Detroit, a collection of rubbish in the back yard of a Los Angeles home, that reminded me of works by Charles Bukowski, and the starkness of a men's bathroom and shoeshine stand - which Kerouac described as a place where the ladies don't go.<br /><br />The photographs suggest the fascination of American's with their cars - one of the best works in the collection is the picture of the dividing strip of an open road at moonlight. They also show the fascination of many American's with the products of Hollywood - with starlets, cowboys, and television - together with the inauthenticity and emptiness of these concerns. Politicians, such as the photograph of the \\"city fathers\\" of Hoboken, New Jersey early in the collection, and of wheeling-dealing. cigar-smoking delegates at the Democratic Party's Presidential convention in 1956 (all men) come across as arrogant, crude, and ignorant. Many of the photographs are draped with flags, or other symbols, and many include comments on American religion, from an African American preacher who traveled up and down the Mississippi River for years to bring people to God, to the crosses, churches, and calls to repentance that dot the American landscape, to orthodox American Jews at the banks of the East River on Yom Kippur casting their sins into the water.<br /><br />For all the melancholy, loneliness, and shallowness they convey, Frank's photographs show an understanding of the United States and a love of its people and places. His photographs of young people capture the alienation that has become commonplace since the 1950s, but also the search for love and meaning. His photographs capture the breadth of the United States, the difficulties of race relations, and the feelings of desolation, conformity, and tension, as people strive for financial security.<br /><br />I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see Frank's photographs themselves at the National Gallery.

B0007O38F8|1|This crappy pop-rap fad has gone on long enough. I hate to use someone else's line, but if I hear any more of this no-talent dreck, I'll stick a stiletto in my ears. \\"FidddEEEEEEEE@EE\\"'s songs have about as much merit as an episode of America's Funniest Home Videos.    But that's okay. This fad is on its way out. Then we'll make room for the next stupid fad for dumb pre-teens to eat up, and 50 Cent here will go down in the same category as Wimp Bizkit, Feminem, Kid Rap, Vanilla Ice, Gerardo, et cetera.    Led Zeppelin. Sublime. The Beatles. The Rolling Stones. Pink Floyd. Green Day. Slayer. Pantera. Nirvana. These bands, or at least their music, has stood the test of time (there are also many more, but they are great examples). People are still discovering their early albums, at least a decade later, and getting into them. That won't be the case with \\"fiddy\\" here, along with the rest of his brain-dead pop-rap ilk (i.e. Nelly, Chingy, et cetera). It's disposable garbage, and the whole genre's 15 minutes of fame are almost up.    I will give him this, though: his moniker describes how much his music is worth (if that).

B001TKEG9G|5|he Bennet sisters are in danger of being poor and homeless should their father die and at least one of them not be married.  When a new neighbor, Mr. Bingley, moves to the neighborhood and appears to be single, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters will marry him.  What ensues is an interesting courtship between Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet, the oldest of the sisters. During the course of this courtship, Jane's younger sister, the headstrong Elizabeth, encounters the brooding Mr. Darcy, a dear friend of Mr. Bingley. Their first impressions of each other are not amiable and lead to dislike on both sides.  The dislike is enforced on Elizabeth's side by her new acquaintance, Mr. Wickham.  She openly accepts Mr. Wickham's reports of Mr. Darcy and her prejudice grows. A surprising proposal by Mr. Darcy and its aftermath lead Elizabeth to rethink her prejudices. What she can not know is that Mr. Darcy's pride is also being reanalyzed by himself.  Will the two ever be able to overcome their pride and prejudice? And if they can, what will be the result of it?<br /><br />This was the first time I have read Pride and Prejudice and it has cemented Jane Austen as one of my favorite authors.  The story line was intricate, marked by detail, humor and romance. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are an enjoyable match and I sympathized with Elizabeth's irritation. I was especially amused by the character of Mr. Bennet. His wit had me laughing, while at other times, his parenting skills appeared to be sorely lacking.<br /><br />Austen masterfully crafted this story that was published when she was only 21.  I am a little in awe of Jane Austen.  The two other books by her that I have read were good, but, in my opinion, this one is the best.<br /><br />This Barnes & Noble Classic edition included an Introduction and Notes by Carol Howard. The Notes were especially helpful in understanding certain portions and the introduction was good.  However, the introduction contained a lot of spoilers and I am thankful I read it after reading the book.oilers and I am thankful I read it after reading the book.

B000NGTJTY|2|There are several top-rated actors in this movie; however, the pace is very slow and for the most part very unexciting.  The last 15 minutes is surprising but it doesn't make up for two hours of pain.  My wife and I watched it and she went to the kitchen several times. When I said I'd pause it she said, no, don't, I can see it from the kitchen.  Then I saw her baking and knew she wasn't interested.<br /><br />As I mentioned, you're not really prepared for the ending.  While a surprise, it also doesn't make a lot of sense.  It seems as if the writers knew the movies was slow going and decided to throw a monkey in the works.  They did and we both went, whoa and then we went 'huh?'.<br /><br />We'd never heard of this movie and now we know why.  We won't buy it or watch it again.
6305508550|5|This is my all time favorite comedy. Believe me, it's abssolutley hilarious.  <br />Peter Gibbons goes to work at Unitech every day and works basically in a cubicle. His friends Michael and Sharim also work with him. Sharim has problems with the copier which he wants to throw out the window, Michael has problems because his name is the smae as a singer (Michael Bolton), and Peter has \\"a case of the mondays\\" and just wants to stop working. Their boss is one of the funniest characters with his awesome lines( yeah..... I'm gonna need you to come in tommorow..). Milton is also funny as he is a small nerdy man who isn't receiving a paycheck who is obsessed with his red stapler. The commotion over the stapler is absolutely hilarious! Then, when Peter's friends get layed off, they all join together to rob Unitech of its money even though Peter got a raise for \\"doing nothing\\"! (His boss hates him but the consultants love him) <br />Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's love but one of the funniest moments is when one employee gets hit by a car while driving to work. He gets insurance money and gets to retire. He then hosts a party saying how lucky he is even though he is in a wheelchair with both of his legs broken! Absolutely hilarious. I'm not going to give away any more of the millionssssss of jokes but I really reccomend this to anyone in the mood for some good laughs.
1503290565|4|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice addresses different perspectives of marriage and conveys the idea that a marriage of love ultimately leads to happiness rather than a marriage of security or convenience which result due to the influence of societal expectations of marriage. Austen effectively utilizes both characterization as well as juxtaposition of excessive pride and prejudice to address society and its fault when approaching the subject of marriage.<br /> Austen introduces Elizabeth Bennet, a strong, independent young woman, through which she is able to defy societal norms and present the idea that a marriage should be of love rather than of financial security or convenience. Elizabeth, in speaking with her sister says, “Your plan is a good one, where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say that I should adopt it.” (pg 17) Through this, it is clear that Austen holds the perspective that a marriage should be of love which will lead to not only a satisfactory but genuinely happy marriage. She contrasts the happy marriage of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a marriage of love, to the marriage of Elizabeth's close friend, Charlotte, who marries Mr. Collins and is satisfied with the security that the marriage brings but lacks true happiness in the relationship.<br /> Austen is also able to effectively convey the progressive idea that marriage should be of love through the juxtaposition of Elizabeth's excessive prejudice and Mr. Darcy's excessive pride. Elizabeth refuses multiple marriage proposals due to her prejudice against the upper class and the idea that she would be marrying for money and stability rather than love. Mr. Darcy is perplexed by the Elizabeth's rejection due to his pride and the idea that anyone would willingly accept a proposal because of his social status. Both characters are overwhelmed with desire and do indeed get happily married, and it is through the development of this relationship that Austen is able to clearly convey her perspective of a marriage out of love.<br /> Austen crafts Pride and Prejudice in a way that addresses the fault of society in regards to marriage without explicitly addressing the fault for which the novel deserves literary merit. The novel, then, provides an entertainment value while still conveying the idea that marriage should be based on love rather than stability—a perspective that would not so easily be accepted had the nature and craft of the novel been different.

0312360258|1|This book is absolute nonsense! I would advise you not to waste your time or money reading (or even considering reading) this book.<br /><br />Marked is about a teenage girl who finds out that she is a 'vampyre' and needs to go away to a special boarding school in order to have even the slightest chance of surviving the transition. Sounds pretty interesting, though I warn you not to become too enthralled by the heap of potential this book undoubtedly has, because it will ultimately disappoint you in the execution...<br /><br />My grievances are thus:<br /><br />* The book is written so poorly that for the first few chapters I was certain that this book was meant to be a parody about the vast amount of vampire and boarding school literature that fill the shelves at bookstores these days. But the further I read the more apparent it became that this book was not, in fact, meant as a parody (which would have excused all of my other complaints) but as a legitimate piece of young adult literature. The juvenile, amateurish writing is so terrible that it is an insult to teenagers everywhere. Teens are not stupid, they are not so ignorant that books need to 'written down' to them. It was in no way necessary to have a character whose sole purpose in the novel was to act as the stereotypical \\"Gay-Guy Friend\\" and constantly define 'big words' that the dumb teenage audience could not possibly understand otherwise...It is inexcusable to assume that your target audience (even if it is for a younger demographic) is not smart enough to handle a novel with intelligent discourse.<br /><br />* I also had a real problem with the portrayal of religious peoples within the novel. Marked portrays people of faith as being wholly closed-minded, ignorant and intolerant, with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Perhaps if this were restricted to a single character it might be easier to digest, however, it is a recurring generalization throughout the novel that people of faith are terrible monsters full of hatred and intolerance for anyone different from themselves. This is downright insulting to those of us who are religious. If the authors have a problem with religion, or organized systems of belief in general, fine...that is their prerogative, but to attack it so blatantly within a piece of fiction is not only stupid on their part (isolates possible readers) but it is simply in bad taste. Shame on the Casts for such irresponsible degradation.<br /><br />* Similar to my distaste with the quality of the writing is my distaste of the quality of dialogue and character development. The dialogue is embarrassingly bad. I was humiliated for the authors reading some of the characters conversations because frankly, I would rather lose both of my hands to gangrene than write and publish a book where any character over the age of five used the words 'poopie' and 'boobie'. That is simply disgusting. What teenager actually speaks in this manner? I am 22 years old, not so far removed from my own teenage years, and cannot fathom hearing a real teenage girl say anything like this in casual conversation. The characters are completely unbelievable. They are flat, silly and utterly contrived. Zoey is the epitome of any wish-fulfillment literature character: she is wittier, prettier, more powerful, blessed, and loved than any other character. She is product of the authors own personal fantasies of who they wish they were projected onto paper. The male love interest is boring. The arch nemesis is laughably cheesy and stereotypical. And the new gaggle of friends that Zoey makes at the boarding school have the potential to be interesting side characters, except that the characteristics which make them individually interesting are so overused that by the end of the book I was sick of the twins antics and of the words 'Okie' and 'Twang'.<br /><br />This book is not worth reading. Trust me, and all of the other people who have posted similar reviews. This book is a disgraceful portrayal of young adult literature, and should have never made it to publication.trayal of young adult literature, and should have never made it to publication.

B00006JKOM|5|A true anomaly in Jethro Tull's catalogue, Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll was positively loathed by the rock press when it was released. The album did reach a respectable 14 in the US charts, but actual sales were nowhere near what previous Tull releases had achieved. That the critics hated this was to be expected, but why did the fans turn off? It's hard to say, as this album is surely Jethro Tull's most \\"commercial\\" album of the Seventies.<br /><br />The array of styles present here are astounding! Folk, jazz, orchestral, blues, rock and (say it's not so!) show-tune stylings are all apparent: all are mixed together in a beguiling way, and the results are as quirky as hell!<br /><br />Quizz Kid, Crazed Institution, Taxi Grab and Big Dipper are all great rock songs, with Ian Anderson's characteristically scornful lyrics and Martin Barre's searing guitar work out front. Crazed Institution, a put-down of the glam rockers of the day, is especially good.<br /><br />Salamander and Bad-Eyed 'N' Loveless are among Anderson's finest acoustic pieces, while the epic title track is the only tune here to halfway establish itself as a radio hit.<br /><br />My personal favorites on Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll are, probably, the oddest tracks. From A Dead Beat To An Old Greaser is a haunting piece redolent of the decadent beat scene of Jack Kerouac, complete with intentionally sleazy sax solo. The Chequered Flag is a gorgeous finale, with some Elgar-like orchestrations and some incredible singing by Anderson. God, could he sing then!<br /><br />The one track on here that really doesn't work is Pied Piper. There's a whiff of \\"knock-off\\" about it, and while it does possess some intriguing quirkiness, the song mostly falls flat.<br /><br />The bonus tracks on here are excellent, too. A Small Cigar is hardly a masterpiece, but David Palmer's piano work is pure elegance! Strip Cartoon has always been one of my favorite tracks, and with its mixture of styles, it fits into this album perfectly!<br /><br />On a final note, although the knocks that this album has taken are not warranted, the criticism of the record's actual concept is entirely valid. Ian Anderson insists that the album's protagonist, one Ray Lomas, is not based on him at all. If that's the case, then it probably wasn't the best idea to have Ray Lomas drawn to resemble Anderson to a tee. Secondly, Ian has always denied making concept albums, but Too Old Too Rock 'n' Roll is a blatant concept album, and the concept is a rather self-aggrandizing one. \\"Once popular rocker became unfashionable but then regains popularity\\" is hardly a gripping dramatic device! But, at the end of the day, the music redeems the concept, and I would say that this ranks as one great album!at this album has taken are not warranted, the criticism of the record's actual concept is entirely valid.

Some reviewers may say that they are doing the same stuff for the last 35 tears. So what? If I want something new, I'll buy a different band.  Great album, to be played loud!
B004GJDQT8|5|I like it a lot.  It's very convenient.
B009HUB40Y|5|My 7 year old son loves the game. He plays it often. He is very fond of these types of games.
B00992CF6W|3|well in this review,I'm going to give you a summary of minecraft pe. With all the fans of minecraft who talk about it so much, it starts to get old.Now for the game. The multiplayer has a ton of glitches. FIX THEM! Survival has the worst lighting all I'm gonna say,but,the updates are getting to be a benifit.<br />( has about 3/4things that creative too! )
0061785679|5|James Rollins is my favorite writer and is at his best in the Eye of God.
B005V5WBFG|5|GREAT , used Norton for YEARS ,but am amazed on what McAfee covers comparatively , HIGHLY recommend for ALL your devices
1452101248|5|Great easy recipes.  His use of spices is superb.  Recipes are quick and easy enough for a weekday meal and special enough for company.  Just love this book!
B0071XO8RA|4|Fascinating characters. Not an 'action' book I would say. But somehow builds quickly and quietly till you're feeling trapped in the silo yourself...
B00DJFIMW6|5|It's a game I've downloaded often and play when I have time. I loved the simple gameplay and (of course) the minions. It's entertaining, keeps me busy and it's always got new environments and updates coming out so there's always something different and that's what I look for in my games c:
B001NLL93W|3|Like the rest of the books in this trilogy (the main 'Mortal Instruments' storyline), this book feels like a spinoff of some combination of Twilight and Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Not surprising based on the fact that this author was into writing fan fic for stories like this.<br /><br />I really didn't get into the story, the love triangle or really any part of this book, but then again I'm not the target audience.<br /><br />It was a quick read, and I thought it was okay. If you're looking for something that is going to be like the next Harry Potter, don't try this book. If you are bored and need to kill a day or two, this will do the trick.
B00CWY76CC|4|its kind of hard to figure out . but once u get it its pretty fun. the directions are aa little vague. u have to click on every thing. once u find an object it helps opening other objects
630522577X|5|My Fair Lady is one of the best musicals every. Its humorist, and great songs like `Wouldn't it be Lovely?'. Audrey  Hepburn is witty as Eliza Doolittle and Rex Harrison is wonderful as Professor Henry Higgins. The  story is about a flower girl that turns into being the belle of England  with some help from the Professor. It is winner to eight academy awards  including best picture.
0061537934|5|Wow...    I stopped by Starbuck's for a coffee on my way home from work and while I was waiting in line noticed that they had a book on display. I read the fly cover and had to buy this book.    Once I read the first chapter I started on an incredible journey that unfolds throughout this book. The story is an emotional roller coaster that grabs you and makes you hold on tight until the end. I finished the book in a couple of sittings over a day and a half and am recommending it to my family and friends to read.    This powerful book tells a gripping story from a dog's point of view.
B00DJFIMW6|1|I downloaded the app and when I tried to play it it would not run... there must be something wring with the game itself
B00CLD65X0|5|Love this show! The character are richly and cleverly crafted. You feel their pains and joys. You get hooked quickly!
1576875776|4|Nice sample of pictures from her prodigious output
B0002HDT9A|3|Timeline is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a team of <br />archaeologists who end up back in the period of history of the place they <br />are excavating.  Having read the novel, I found the movie dissappointing. <br />I liked the movie but only because of the romance between Gerard Butler <br />and Lady Claire.  He solely seemed to grasp the essence of the role and <br />became the part of Andre Marek.  The rest of the cast never seemed to get it. <br />Richard Donner has directed some very entertaining movies, perhaps this just isnt his genre.
B002VPE1B6|3|Guess you have to be into that sort of presentation.  The music was hard for Aunt Gertrude to disgest. Did not finish.
B0000549B0|5|Whats not to love!!! What a great, fun movie.
0142421715|5|Love this trilogy!!! I'm about to finish the last book and I don't want it to end!!!
1878424319|4|Great.
B000JMKNV0|5|I loved this book! the ending was so amazing I had to go back and read all of the clues I had missed!<br />highly recommended!
B00FATEJYE|5|Coool
034580404X|3|I like the books: or you're for it, or you're against it. Although a lot of people told me it's plain hard porn; it's not. It's a love story, funny written, specially for us in our monthly read. The only thing I was disappointed in, is that the main character was so 'easy'. I don't want to spoil things for people who haven't read it, so I'll leave it at that; I guess you'll know what I'm talking about when you've read it.
B002ZG98LO|1|I think there must be a contest among Oscar winners to see who can make the academy voters regret the decision to give them the statue in the first place. Else, how would you explain Natalie Portman starring in Your Highness or Marissa Tomei doing awful romantic comedies for the rest of the 90s? Or Halle Berry - just Halle Berry - what were they thinking? With Adrien Brody, one thinks that we have a winner as he growls and grunts his way through this tepid \\"action\\" thriller with the exact inflection throughout. I think he's some special ops but I can't really tell as his growling is a little too much like a mutter to really make out his words.    Beyond that, this thing is full of people just walking through jungles with the \\"spooky\\" music playing. Sure the Predators come eventually but when they do, you're too bored out of your scowl (and annoyed with the academy for giving Adrien Brody an Oscar) to really care.
B001UEBHYS|5|I loved this movie it was funny it was moving it showed that when your dirt poor that anything can happen to a person when they believe in them selves
B004QSQMKE|3|partly my fault.  It was the director's cut which had more scenes not in the original movie but different music which detracted from the movie.
B00003CXB4|4|it said  two disc, but there was only one disc  in it , it had a few scratches that made it skip a little, but it plays pretty good
B008JGSM6G|3|its not a bad game - it is just a little to simplistic for my taste.  The game was diverting for awhile but I doubt I will go back to it.
B00633W614|4|Excellent development of a wonderful variety of characters, and a perfect settling in the early days of WWII in England.
B00MCC6UR6|4|Very interesting...... had me thinking alot. Love it.
B000PC0S5K|5|This is the book I would take if I could take one book to a deserted island. It's life-changing and continues to inform and teach me about myself and how to live more joyously. I have given this book as a gift to many friends and have recommended it many more. Read it. It will change your life.
B00BAXFECK|1|Cummon, this is the least plausible story I've read in a long time.  Who is this guy?  A shy innocent pining for his mother, then a drug-addled teen (because he lost his mother?), then -- wait for it -- a gunman in a European fracas.  Yeah, right.  All the trouble the author went to to learn details of antiquing, etc. are probably one reason some readers think this book is worthy.  Admittedly there are a couple of cute (as in, well orchestrated) twists, including the one that gives it a happy ending, but it took a long time to get to that ending and the last philosophizing pages are simply a bore.
B00HV2KU5A|5|You'll love this movie!  Even my 7 to 9 year old grandsons liked it!  Love the music also!  Glad I bought it!
B00164EAC8|3|I had high hopes for this film when it was plastered all over the billboards during it's release back in 1998. I prepared for some changes in the story, but hoped I would still see a glimmer of the charm of the original character that so many have fond memories from their childhood for.<br /><br />This film starts out pretty good, decent effects, cast, production, etc even a couple of nods to Jaws with the fishing boats being pulled backwards and the fishing dock scene.....I'm not sure why they decided to have it raining through the entire movie, but it becomes very tiresome to watch this dreary film.<br /><br />Add the fact that it is too long, the baby Godzilla brood is completely unnecessary (and too reminiscent of Jurassic Park) and you've got a remake that isn't much fun, didn't appeal much to the general public and infuriated loyal fans of the G Man!.<br /><br />The 4K Blu Ray however is pretty decent, the picture is very good and the sound is intense to say the least, but that alone isn't enough to save this film from being anything but mediocre. If you consider that Godzilla has appeared in over 30 films, there are bound to be a few that aren't all that good, but the biggest problem with this one is it just isn't nearly as fun as any of them.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It's much better than flabby bird, it has different features unlike that other one that is plain boring.<br /> I'll be playing this all day!!!
B00006HBUA|5|Replacing all VHS tapes with DVD's. Always enjoyed watching Scooby-Do on Saturday mornings. Having a live-action version is great and just as mysterious as the cartoon.
B00A3NQNUU|5|Dragon vale is a fun game and relaxing to ur mind if u are stressed play dragon vale.
B00ALQSNV6|5|Oddly enough, after watching all 6 episodes back to back and enjoying the very real animation as well as the great info and narration, I went to bed and had the wildest nightmares / dreams. All involved current peoples, places etc. but terrorized by dinosaurs. I can only attribute it to my ever enthusiastic feelings about the subject but especially to the terrific animation. I was right next to them watching the series, and they were right next to me after I was done for the night. It was a bit of a &#34;double feature&#34; if you will!<br />Bob
B00BPDR3F6|4|This novel flows slowly, majestically like an Amazon or a Ganges.  It springs from a lively source, then proceeds patiently at a slow pace. There are brief eddies and rapids, as when the unlikely heroine goes to Tahiti.  Then settles into an expansive delta meeting its end.  Gilbert has created a protagonist who has such an internal life, she almost does not need dialogue with others.  The book has few human dialogues: Alma has her mosses to talk to. There are memorable characters:  Alma's parents, housekeeper, uncle. However one never gets inside the heads of the adopted sister, the mad friend or the angelic husband.  Somehow, they are never real enough.  In spite of these drawbacks, Alma emerges as a strong woman, a sensitive scientist, and ultimately, an altruistic heroine.<br /><br />It took me months to arrive at the end, but then the story traverses more than a century and the earth itself.
1451695195|2|Lost interest quickly, it told more about her life as a struggling person than her experience for which she named the book after. Not worth reading in my opinion
B00B7PIRIE|5|I couldn't be happier! This three season collection of Downton Abbey was a &#34;must have&#34; addition to my personal collection. The price couldn't be beat and they were all factory sealed boxes. I am very satisfied!!
B003I55BIA|5|Where to begin! Going into it I was expecting a very cliched story and I have to admit I'm not even sure why I chose to read this book after having read the title and the little synopsis. Whatever the reason, I did end up reading the book and the beginning did start off very cliched though I found myself wanting to read more. The first couple chapters establish how polar opposite Alex and Brittany are yet they have something in common. They live in totally different world.... dadadada. The whole beginning was very predictable and, like I said, cliche. The further I got into it though, the better it got. Alex and Brittany's connection grew stronger and more undeniable and I couldn't wait for them to finally get together. They both go through the whole falling-madly-in-love process and the whole time I found myself rooting for them. I desperately wanted them to work out and have a happily-ever-after fairy tale ending though something bad was bound to happen.<br /><br />The ending was perfection. After about half-way the whole book went by really fast, as in I lost track of time because I was so into it. The conclusion was perfection and I'm so glad that it was made to seem more realistic than total cliche and that it didn't happen so fast.<br /><br />Emotionally, the book played all the right music. I was grinning from ear to ear, hurting for Alex and Brittany, craving for Alex, and definitely feeling that passion that is there between them.<br /><br />The more I read the harder I found it to put the book down. The story was beautiful and truly a love story. It might have its fair share of cliches but the cliches are done right. Someone reading this book probably likes contemporary love stories (think Sarah Dessen, Deb Coletti, etc.) in that case the book hits all the right marks and leaves you completely satisfied.
B008VZAJWK|5|Great movie!  Humor was smart and managed well.  Story line is fantastic.
B009UX2YAC|5|Amazing because graphics are better in all running games
B00I6IKSZ0|4|I am going to get it in a weak because my sister deleats games and William if you ever find this not I can not get on my kindle I have got it tocan  away by my sister by.
B0014I4KIK|5|The first song I heard was \\"Mercy\\" and quite frankly I was not very impressed. Then I listened to \\"Rockferry\\" but still wasn't sure if I liked it.  I was walking by the new releases section and saw that it was on sale. Bought the CD, and after listening to it several times I've grown to love it - especially \\"Warwick Avenue\\".  I look forward to buying her next album - whenever it comes out.
B009YP9L7U|5|I thought this was a great read. It is sweet & funny. I would recommend it to those who want a light read.
B003ES5ZPK|4|I have a problem in that my A/V receiver is almost too large for my entertainment cabinet, so while I have just enough room to plug HDMI cables in, they end up a little smooshed/crimped by the back of the cabinet.<br /><br />This swivel adapter solves the problem by making it so my HDMI cables face up from my A/V receiver instead of out from it.<br /><br />The only issue is that it's a little thick, so if you're hoping to use it behind a thin, wall mounted TV or something, it may be too big to fit in a port that doesn't have a lot of clearance.<br /><br />Recommended overall.
B004HO6I2E|4|Another Funny Movie....if you like Comedy keepsyou engaged the whole movie with laughter. Again shoudl not watch with minors but funny
B00IQE4NUK|5|perfect as expected.
B00008EY65|4|I'm not a comic book fan, however; I have to admit I enjoyed this movie immensely and was pleasantly surprised. Ron Perlman in my humble opinion made the movie. I loved his character and the part he played. I'm disappointed in the negative feedback and was hoping for a little more positive remarks. I didn't find this movie or the acting chessy at all. I can't wait for the DVD to come available and I'm pleased by the hope of Hellboy2.
B00E72OKAS|5|Addictive and fun.
B00004WEJZ|1|I've never been a big fan of remakes.  It seems to be particularly annoying with this one, since the main actor was also the one who starred in the original.  This would seem to make re-hashing this movie a pointless endeavour.  Why not just watch the original?  I find it hard to believe that so many other reviewers have said this is a good movie.
B00008G8M4|4|It's nice that I can watch in the original form or the remastered version with 9 extra minutes. But, I really couldn't tell the difference.
B0039TD7RC|4|I can pinpoint the precise moment the Rolling Stones stopped being cool to me (a middle-aged fan who's been listening to them since the late 1970s). It was that awful Super Bowl halftime show when they slogged through Start Me Up, Satisfaction and some other crappy standard while looking ghoulish (and not the \\"fun\\" ghoulish they sported from 1981-2000). It was the end of a great run. They retained their cache through four decades, even after their albums stopped being good. I think Some Girls was their last good album, but that ended the best string ever published. 1967's \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" wasn't great, but then they recorded Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Get Yer Ya-Yas Out (a live album, but a great one), Exile on Main Street, Goat's Head Soup, Black and Blue, It's Only Rock and Roll and Some Girls.     Even after the new records declined in quality, if you were a Stones fan, they were still a must-see concert right up into the 2000s.  Contrast that to the Who, whose live shows got unbearably dull after they completed their Tommy and Quadrophenia tours in the mid-1990s (though I enjoyed the Quadrophenia shows tremendously).  I'm still a big Who fan, but I would never buy tickets to see them live again.      I just listened (twice) to the new reissue of Exile on Main Street and I love it. They noticeably cleaned up the flaws on the original (they got rid of that annoying tape hiss on \\"Sweet Virginia!\\") without ruining the raw, gritty quality that made Exile unique and unforgettable. Some of the vocals are a just a bit TOO cleaned up, but overall it's much better than the original CD release.  And you still can't make out what Mick is saying on most of these tracks, which is good.      But it's rarely worthwhile to shell out cash for an album you already own on CD, even if the sound quality is better. I bought this reissue on the day it came out because of the tantalizing prospect of 10 unreleased songs from 1972. The new songs aren't nearly as good as the ones on Exile, and some of the vocals sound suspiciously like Mick's voice today.  But the newly released material is better than anything on, say, Undercover. Two of the songs are alternate versions of \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\" (sung by Keith), but the other eight are honest-to-goodness unreleased Stones songs from the best part of their career. Some of the songs stand out.  I particularly enjoyed Dancing in the Light, and Plundered My Soul, which they released to radios stations a few weeks before the album came out, is pretty good too.  At the very least, this is the last decent new Stones material we're likely to hear, EVER. Definitely worth picking up for that reason alone, even if you already have \\"Exile\\" on CD.     All that said, many of the reviews posted here praising the vinyl version have me very curious.  A few more classic releases like this and I may re-enter a word I left behind in 1984 involving turntables, diamond needle cartridges, \\"Discwasher\\" cleaning tools and nickels piled on my tonearm to reduce \\"skating\\".
B000B8QEZG|5|When I first bought this album, I limited myself to repeat plays of HUNG UP and I LOVE NEW YORK. But then I started listening to more tracks and now I can say that the best tracks on this album,(in my opinion) are:  <br />                      HUNG UP <br />                      I LOVE NEW YORK <br />                      JUMP <br />                      FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />                      GET TOGETHER <br />                      HOW HIGH <br /> <br />This album is a mix of disco beats, techno, and it definitely also has a strong 80's feel to it.  I can't get enough of this one...
B00BEIYP1W|5|I just got through watching the movie &#34;Rush&#34; for the second time this week. For my taste, it was the best movie released on DVD in a year. I personally am not familiar with either of the two lead actors, but they were terrific. The story of two formula 1 racers, each having his very different beliefs on how to win the championship. This is a true story that took place in the 1960's. I remember the tragic misfortunes of one racer that contributed to his rivals championship. The movie was directed by Ron Howard. For those who are not racing fans, there is much more to this movie than racing. See this movie...you won't be disappointed.
B004NS710C|5|I don't know why I have it twice here because I only got one, you may check this issue really.
1400079276|5|My girlfriend gave me this book as a gift.  She told me the bookstore where she picked it up kept Murakami books behind the counter due to shoplifting issues.  This should give you some indication of how good it is.  If kids want to shoplift your book I bet it's freaking great.  And you know...it really is.  Magical, Compelling, Simple, Surreal.  It's all of those things.  Prior to reading this book I wasn't a real big surreal fiction fan, but Murakami is a true artist and master of the genre.  The translations are spot on.  The writing is smooth.  The descriptions are vivid.  I highly recommend this book to anyone open minded enough, courageous enough, bored enough, interested to read it.  You'll like it.
B000002NJS|4|I have never liked Madonna or her music, I'm not into pop, but I read an  article about the album in KEYBOARD magazine, and got my curiosity pricked.  Some of these somes are very entertaining, others I'm not into. The first  five songs plus &quot;Frozen&quot; are the best by far. I like her vocals,  but not the Lyrics. The album is worth buying even just for the songs  mentioned.
006202406X|5|Great book but you should probably read the first two before this one
