B007HO392S|5.0|I enjoyed all of the songs on this CD. My favorite CD from Carrie was Carnival Ride, but this one was very good too. All of the songs are very nice and are a wonderful blend of country with some popular influences.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|got this for my hubby to read loves it  the loves to read in his 18 wheeler and use his kindle for his reading
1250038820|5.0|A great book.  Beautiful images and insightful text.  A slice of humanity.  This is a high quality, hardcover at a great price.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Not too difficult but is a fairly long game. Some spots are a little challenging. Good game for the price.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It looks pretty fun  I'm downloading it right get it people you'll be surprised and+ it's FREE !!!!!!! Love the movie to
B005V5WBFG|2.0|it's really slowness the device and eats its active memory. if you have game running say - The Hunger Games Adventures. The application will be closing at time to time to release the memory
B003Q6D27S|3.0|saw this movie. didnt like it but what i did like was the service. got here as they said it would be and it looks great. too bad i couldnt say the same about the movie. about 1 1/2 or so of my life wasted. lol anyway....
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|It's a quick and nice read.  It seems a little more simplistic than Gladwell's previous books, but he still left me with a few things to think about.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very good read!!! Well now read more of Grisham's books . I though I had it figured out about half way but I was sure wrong!! Very good!!!
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I really enjoyed reading most of the Scarpetta series. But the last few books have gotten steadily worse. As the kids would say WTMI (Way to much information)<br />Why does she have to go into so much infinite detail.  I think some detail is important to get a reader into the story. The first of the series were perfect. The later ones go into such detail I find myself thinking...Okay okay...I know what a shoe looks like.....And Dust was so drawn out, it didn't get interesting until the very end. If I stopped reading and then went back k to it, I had to re-read a few paragraphs to remind myself what was happening.  I think the next time she has a new book, I will wait until I have read some reviews. I won't pre order again. The first half of this one , to me, was very boring.

B006M4F67A|4.0|I think 24/7 games is a very challenging game I enjoyed it. I will play it often more then my other games. It's nice to keep my brain going
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Excellent Show.  One of the best I have seen, unfortunately they cancelled the series too soon.<br /><br />Imagine &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; or &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; being shut down in the middle of the first season.  Just as the show starts to really flow, and the story line start to take off...they cancel it.<br /><br />I hope they bring it back, but you know they won't.  Those actors are onto other projects and it will never be the same.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|The theme is wonderfull for old people ,we are 69 and the music wellchosen .Cadeau to Dustin Hoffman for instruction. Other older danes would like to see the movie ,but dont speak well English ,so we text it for the deafs ,but would have liked it texted in a Scandinavian language ,because the are  very similar Viking languages Thanks

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app.  Gives the battery condition for whatever you might be doing.  Also gives length of time left.  Very handy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has allowed family members to watch movies on Netflix and videos from Youtube within the comfort of the family room where the big screen TV is located. I am presently benefiting from the Netflix 3 month free trial resulting from said purchase (made btw within hours of product launch).

B006LXQID8|5.0|I love this movie more and more ever time I watch it! Perfection is how I would describe this character.
B00DJUPLY8|5.0|If, like me, you are looking for a simple, uncomplicated way to view videos this app is exactly what you need.  I can now watch and store the videos I receive of my grandson!  I tried about 5 others ...Felt i needed to be Stephen Spielberg to figure them out... this app is easy.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Loved it! Marcus is a true hero! I am telling all of my friends about this book. A must read!

B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I wasn't expecting such a sad story line even though I read the description & some reviews.  Didn't figure out the murderer though so I guess it was a good story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addictive... you just want to complete every task they give you and all the minions look so real. It's kinda weird at first(the look) but you get used to it
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game is really interesting and entertaining. It keeps players tension and anxienty due to the ever increasing demands. Super
B003U0AHBO|1.0|I really like this actor but this was a most disappointing performance. If you like Crowe don't bother with buying this DVD. Had the subject matter been dealt with in a more detailed manner and made into a much longer production it MIGHT have been some better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's so addictive! Each level poses a new challenge. Fun competing against friends! Can get frustrating but persistence pays off usually....
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|All in one Mahjong<br />It is a game I will enjoy playing a lot and it is also a challenge.
6305657947|5.0|Good entertainment. Pearce at his best with great supporting actors and roles. Good job of casting in this movie. Worth keeping in my library for once a year watching.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Very disappointed I love the game but once you reach a certain level you must either pay or ask someone who is on Facebook for permission to go farther I might be one of the few to not have a Facebook account and I refuse to get one just to play games. I have friends that lost jobs due to Facebook and I have been denied employment due to not having one just so the employer can see who I hang out with and what I am into it is none of their business.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Definitely worth the $35 impulse buy price especially if you don't mind waiting the couple/few extra days in delivery when you select super saver shipping for free.<br /><br />This was able to resolve the issue I was having watching Netflix in High Def on my HDTV in the living room via the Sony Bluray player I have that can also play Netflix streaming.  But as of some months ago, late at night and on weekends too, I would notice it would not stream in high def and the image looked like garbage on my TV.  If I started to watch a movie early enough I could get it to load in high def but if I did it at just the right time and it got later, then the little bandwidth meter would start to go down and then the movie would constantly buffer.  If I stopped the movie and reloaded it, it would start up again in really low def mode.  Needless to say this was unacceptable.  To make a long story short, research proved that it was not an issue with my cable Internet or the signal strength of my WiFi.  This is &#34;by design&#34; of the Sony Neflix based players, they go through some kind of Sony servers that apparently as of late get congested during prime time (at night) and on weekends.<br /><br />This device connects directly to Netflix like a Wii or your computer or smart phone and works great, even supports 5.1 audio on select titles which the builtin app on my Sony Bluray player could not do in Netflix.<br /><br />I also tested out watching an older (circa 2002) movie from Google Movies on it and it looked considerably good considering its age and probably not having been filmed for high def.<br /><br />Also Youtube, while some videos will obviously look like they were filmed by someone's phone camera (probably were), I did find some videos that were obviously filmed with high quality HD equipment and I've never seen Youtube look so good at 1080p!<br /><br />The controls are much easier to use than my Bluray players especially for searching for a specific movie.  Now I no longer need to get on the computer first to find something to watch and add it to my queue just to make selecting it on the player on the TV easier.  Just navigate to it quickly sitting on the couch with my phone, select the Chromecast to watch and hit play!<br /><br />I have yet to try other things like Pandora/Google Music mostly because my current stereo does no support HDMI and it would break my heart to hear my music through the pathetic speakers of my TV.  But if it's anything like the Pandora app on my Bluray player shouldn't be half bad.<br /><br />Only thing I wish it had was an Amazon Instant Video app, maybe that's in the works.<br /><br />Overall very happy with it and enjoy using it at least 3 or more nights out of the week time permitting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun when you need a little break from the daily tasks or want to kick back to just play a simple game. Pass time while waiting at doctors office, dentist, spouse to return from shopping and a good travel game,
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I have been following Big Fish for quite some time, and this is one of my favorites. I have literally played every one of their point and click adventure games (that have been available on kindle fire), but this one is a great new addition.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is a challenging mind game that allows you to get away from other things going on in your life and allows you to relieve stress while keeping the brain in shape. It is also fun meeting a challenge.
B00EJOCAYW|4.0|I purchased this for my grandson for Christmas. I was shocked when I saw the box-about 6 inches square--and it cost $34.95. Legos are way overpriced.  He BETTER like it.
0375413405|5.0|What's not to love about Julia Child? She was obviously a great chef, but she was also a great wit. And this book shows us both. Her recipes can be long and involved, but she describes how to do them so that even I, a self-proclaimed stooge in the kitchen, can follow them and produce very tasty meals. Her defining dish may well be Beef  Bourguignon, and my wife and I followed the rather involved recipe to the T, or teaspoon, and it was delicious! This book is a must have for people who want to cook something special every once in a while.
B0090SI56Y|1.0|i've seen the worst movie ever, i should b bumed ,but i'm elated, nothing will b worse. i'll try to state the eff ups in the order they appear.in the beginning it shows logan in a japanese prison camp at the time of the 2nd nuclear bombing(,but in the 1st movie didn't it show him with victor[sabertooth] on d-day, unlikely that he would fight in the earopean front of wwll one day then fight victorless in the pacific theater right after that,but it's possible) when 1 japanese soldier set him free to attempt to run from the comming blast he refused to leave his underground cell saying \\"that's a b52 , i can't run from what's coming,& i'll be better off underground\\". shortly after that all the japanese,but the one who set logan free commit sepuku(honorable japanese suicide). logan drags him down in his hole,& shields him from the blast with his body, directly after the blast the japanesite wants to get out of the hole,but logan warns him not to, stateing that deadly radiation lingers after a nuke blast. (that city was nagasaki, the 2nd city to ever b nuked,but how did the japanese,& logan know there was a nuke on the b52[wouldn't it b funny if regular bombs fell after japanese freed prisoners ,& commited sepuku], how did logan know deadly radiation lingered shortly after a nuke went off, probably wasn't common knowledge then [only 3 days between blasts of hiroshima/nagasaki,& no intraweb])<br />i realy don't feel like explaining all that movies mistakes, i would basically have to retell the story. just take my advice,& don't waste u're time with this piece of crap. it's sad, i thought the 1st one was good. i guess hugh jackman can b in a horrible movie.(oh yeah... i waited the whole movie for gabit[remy lebough my favorite character from 1st one],but i was disappointed yet again)
0393064476|5.0|In 1417 a book hunter finds an ancient poem in a monastery. The poem was, On The Nature of Things, by Lucretius, a Roman  poet and adherent to the Epicurean or humanist way of life. In other words, people could enjoy their lives without fear of angering the Gods. The discovery of this old manuscript in the 15th century leads, in many ways, to the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. Lucretius' worldly ideas, of course were abhorrent to the religious establishment. Greenblatt does a great job of walking us through all the ways the ideas expressed in the poem helped produced the modern world we know today.
0988178532|5.0|A fun and exciting romp in (and above) the woods of the Pacific NW.  A solid winner with substance and style in the spirit of Harry Potter.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This, by far in my opinion is the most thrilling, fright filled paranormal film out right now.  The film has no sexual scenes,  very mild language, (No F word what so ever.)<br />It basically received the &#34;R&#34; rating for fright, being overly scary.<br />The goriest scene in the entire film would have to be the scene where they have to perform a exorcism on the mother.  They place a white sack over her head, where she spews blood on it leaving the viewer to wonder what in the world is happing to her features.<br />The only other gory scene would have to be where the mother bits or scraps cannot remember which, the face on the cop during the exorcism.<br />All in all, the cast was fantastic.  Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, playing the roles of the two paranormal investigators &#34;The Warrens&#34;, and lastly Lili Taylor, playing the role of the mother.<br />The acting was decent, the film was actually based off the true case files of the Warrens.  So not only do you get the true story of what happen at the farm house and that family, you also get to see scenes of other paranormal investigations the Warrens have attended.  The very begin of the film shows another Warrens case films, being the story of the possessed doll name &#34;Annabel&#34;.<br />The film is based off a true story.<br />All in all, the film was brilliant.  I have a copy, and highly recommend it for the person that likes paranormal stuff, and being scared, to add it to their collection or to at least watch it.<br />Other movies by James Wan: &#34;Saw trilogy&#34;, &#34;Death Sentence&#34;, &#34;Sinister&#34;, &#34;Dead Silence&#34;, &#34;Insidious&#34; 1 and part 2, and I believe &#34;Dark Skies&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is a lot of fun.....a lot friends are needed to advance to the next level,or you can purchase advancements....
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I'm big fan of the series y this film completes mi collection. The only problem was that the code for the digital copy doesn't work.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great book!!  The first Lee Child I've read and I couldn't put it down. I loved the main character and the way he thought. Can't wait for more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a love story! It's a look inside the feelings and emotions of someone who tries to love the unloveable. I can't wait to read the rest of the books! In fact I'm ready to download the next one now! Happy reading to you!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This is the cd to purchase!! Love every song on this cd. Most cds you have to skip a track to get to another good song. Artpop will keep you dancing till the last track. So far the best purchase I have made thus far!!!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|It can get a bit repetitive, but on the whole it is fun to play and worth playing. Plus it is easy to learn and the goals are realistically obtainable
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game.Overall good experience with this app. I recommend this app if anyone likes this kind of app or type of game likes this.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is different. But have to play and see. for your self it gets more addicting as you play...just try...
B009PK9SB8|3.0|Nice addition to the GoPro. Small size but expected given the camera size. Access to menus a plus. Downside it drain on the battery life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this, and was so happy it finally came to kindle.  I have been looking for it for a long time.

B00340ESIS|5.0|What a funny, easy-to-read and helpful guide to writing a screenplay. I have begun putting the author's tips to use and I like the effect it is having on my writing. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|Makes me laugh even the second and third times around.  We always buy the DVDs even though we watch the show when aired.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a must have for fans! The graphics are ok and the button config is perfect and I guarantee that it is well worth your time.
B000053VAZ|3.0|There's a lot to like about this film but certain things nagged me into not liking it as well as some other viewers.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Joon is mentally ill (schizophrenia?) and her brother, who owns a auto repair shop can't bring himself to put her in a home. The constant attention she needs (he needs to giver her) has made it so he has no life. He wins a friend's cousin, Sam (Johnny Depp), in a card game. Sam himself is more than a bit weird but he and Joon get on well together. This begins to raise some other problems.<br /><br />The set up is simple enough, but one major point nagged me to distraction. It was the Sam character. We don't know his story. He's illiterate, quiet, watches old films late at night and dresses much like the stars in silent films. He even goes through elaborate routines from films of days gone by and he's really good at it. So what's the scoop? Is HE mentally ill? Odd maybe. Ill? You just don't know. Who were his parents? His uncle was the one that pawned him off in the card game. How is it he got away, in this day and age, without an education? His love of silent film denotes a certain degree of romance but that just wasn't enough for me. And  then there's Benny. A strong handful of movies have been made involving an interdependent relationship where you ask yourself who's taking care of who. There was really nothing new added here.<br /><br />Mary Stewart Masterson as Joon does a superb job. Aidan Quinn is good enough as Benny but it's not his best role. Julianne Moore is always good. Her part could have been written a bit better. Dan Hedaya is good in a woefully small role and William H Macy's role was so small he must have been doing someone a favor.<br /><br />This is a decent enough movie. It's very likable and Depp really shines. It just couldn't deliver the goods for me. It might be more of a woman's film because it's aimed more at the heart. It's a good watch so don't pass it up on my word.
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|Entertaining, sort of remake/prequel to the original.  Characters aren't annoying like most horror movies, they behave fairly realistically.  Fans of the original should like this one.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Some of the situations are weird but the song is catchy I think this game is super funny no problems whatsoever
B0053B347M|2.0|So as some others have noted, these are really not bright enough at all.  I saw the reviews before I purchased.  Some said plently bright... some said not bright enough... For the price I took a chance.  I have them attached to a 24 inch monitor that is about 3 inches away from the wall behind it - you can barely tell there is any backlight at all... and the room is very dimly lit.  I will note that my wall is a darker color though, but I would still say that unless you are planning on using these in a pitch black room and have white walls... and you have a much smaller monitor than 24&#34;... then look for another backlight source as these don't quite cut it.
B002WY65VU|5.0|1 of the best shows i have seemin a long time easy to follow not easy to prodict next move
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I have tried every diet under the sun.  This is working for me.  I have very little will power.<br /><br />I love the fact that when you really want to eat something you shouldn't, it is always less than 24 hours away, so you can talk yourself out of it.  Often the craving has disappeared the next day anyway.  It goes against all current recommendations for weight management, but really is a &#34;Captain Obvious&#34;. Eat less and you will weigh less. DOH!<br /><br />This is the perfect diet for people like me who love cooking and eating.  Instead of doing it every day, just do it every second day, I am fasting alternate days but only 3 days in 7 which gives me some flexibility and if I need to, I don't feel bad if I can only manage 2 in 7.  Will keep with 3:4 until my weight is where I want it to be, but have lost 5kg (11lbs) already.  Yay me!
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Very entertaining sci-fi movie with great CGI and sound.  Plenty of character development and not all focused on big boss battles.
0385751532|5.0|Excellent book, best for teens, I enjoyed reading it now my husband is reading it too. Better than watching the movie
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I bought the book for me and then bought 3 as a present for very important people in my life. Anita brings to the world an incredible message full of Hope, Love and Truth. If you still haven't....buy it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been an addict throughout my whole pregnancy &amp; now my daughter just turned 1 yr. In October &amp; still Loving it!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I saw Man of Steel originally during the summer and I must say this was the best verision of Superman I've watched. I really haven't been crazy about Superman on film since the first 2 movies of the Christopher Reeve era. The other films after Superman II were either corny (Superman III), terrible (Superman IV), or just lackluster & rehashed plot (Superman Returns).<br /><br />WB & Zack Synder gave us something worth watching w/Man of Steel a fresh plot & a new perspective on who Superman is. I think adding Zod & the Kryptonian outcasts was a perfect way to show Superman's complete opposite and sets the conflict of the movie. I think the Zod/Superman fight plants the seeds for M.O.S. II (which Batman will be introduced) from all the destruction & chaos caused from the fight.<br /><br />Man of Steel is like a Batman Begins take on Superman I say this is a 10/10.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The item arrived the same day my Macbook Pro came froom Apple :) I use it with my Apple 27&#34; display that comes with a charger cord that needed this little converter. I like it becuase It just works!

B00021HBGS|5.0|The kids have fun sticking on the wall and leaving it on until next day!  The pieces are durable.  I'll need to see how long it lasts, and see if mildew or stuff grows on 'em.

B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I loved the quality of the purchase, the movie was probably the worst of all the Iron Man's thus far... (that's just me)
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I had this on VHS and wanted a DVD copy...was not disappointed.  The best of Clint Eastwood along with a great cast including Gene Hackman (who once again has you hating his character throughout the flick).
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book os the best you should get this book<br />It's very very very good don't skip any pages tho she skips around
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Stephen needs to get back to really scaring you.  I was so excited to follow the journey after The Shining.  It just seemed like another novel.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great game, very challenging.  Keeps me engrossed for hours. I just can't put it down until I solve the level.
B005VT42BS|5.0|A must have for any network admin, great way to get a snapshot of the devices on your network. I use it daily.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|If you love big bang science stuff and a family comedy then watch this.  It is from syfy so take some things with a grain of salt. But over all vary funny.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Well written in ideas and specific storytelling. I ENJOYED THE Point of view the author was writing. I look forward to future works.
1908117230|3.0|The book is beautiful - positively stunning. Well photographed, (generally) great recipes, etc. Making macarons is truly not as hard as people claim it is, but it does require following directions, attention to detail, and if using these recipes - some level of intuition.<br /><br />When I first bought this book, within minutes I found several substantive errors (items missing from the ingredients list, but referenced in the instructions, etc.). I actually wrote the publisher because the book was not inexpensive and I personally found it to be so disappointing. The publisher actually wrote back a friendly reply saying the first print had errors and would send me a second print once it was out. Well, to my surprise, they actually followed through! Unfortunately, while some issues were resolved, even the second print had some errors in it. As an experienced baker, I am able to use context clues and previous knowledge/experience/intuition to figure things out that aren't clear in the text, but someone with less kitchen experience probably would be very disappointed with the book.<br /><br />If the book weren't riddled with such egregious errors, it would be a 5-star all the way. But to have numerous prints with substantive errors is really hard to justify, especially at over $30.<br /><br />With all that said, the Italian Meringue method Herme uses is really good and described in great detail (even though some of the directions have improper timing associated with them - for example, when he says to begin beating the egg whites would not work with the timing he suggests, etc.) and yields good results *if* you are aware of how to make do with middling instructions.<br /><br />As for standout recipes, well, the saffron peach macaron and pistachio raspberry were, bar none, the best macarons I've ever had. This book has the potential to be *the* best macaron book out there. But at present, it leaves quite a bit to be desired.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|Pretty good for the price.  If my 13 year old has not broken it yet then it must be wicked durable!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Amazing book of courage and perservering, not to mention the amazing love animals have for &#34;us&#34; not just we for them and the incredible power of heeling these animals can provide.  It's a must read!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Every paragraph pulled me to the next.  The real John Grisham stood up.  I am looking forward to more &#34;can't put this book down&#34; novels from the master tale spinner!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I always play in my tablet, when I tried to play in my pc the system simply took off all my levels, bringing me to the very beginning, its really a shame they did that to me, restarting is not fun.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|bought on a whim, listen to over and over and over.  perfect for diving in to or having on in the background.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A very well written novel that intertwines three separate story lines into one cataclysmic ending. I didn't question any reality or whether a character would actually behave that way or say that phrase. It was very real.
B008NW67E0|4.0|solid album if you're into folk rock.  I don't think it's as good as their first album, but it is a perfect one to play intermingled with the other one.  If you like this music, also try Of Monsters and Men
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I think this has to be one of the most beautiful pieces of fiction that I have ever read. Thank you, Mr. Hosseini.
B0014LX420|5.0|Brittney Spears greatest hits...need I say more?  Whether you are 15 years old or 35 years old her style and penache are unduplicated!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After reading first and second parts I had high hopes for a majestic finally. But I was disappointed to meet a pile of non realistic and illogical sequence of events.
1451678193|5.0|Classic Ray Bradbury novel - if you are into sci-fi, this should be a must read.  It's a quick read, interesting plot and should serve as great jumping off point to get your kids into sci-fi (if you want that...)
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|All the gang is back again for another wonderful trip to the disc. There is action and adventure a plenty and a fun take on modern society as always
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|i had high hopes for this movie, but it was more or less depressing.  I will concede the fact that I am 30 and may have enjoyed this a lot more if i was actually 40 (not joking, i really think it was more applicable to 40 year olds).
067144901X|5.0|I actually don't mind reading this one 4 times in a row because it is cute and has a good rhyme scheme.  I love to pause and let my toddler say the animal sounds.  It's sweet.  At 17 months, she loves it and asks for it by saying  \\"lalalala\\"
B000094A6A|5.0|One of the great comedic movies made in recent history...right up there with Tommy Boy, Dumb and Dumber and other classics.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This a good book for adults. It is not a good book for kids. Adults sometimes don't let their kids read it.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|great CGI (ignore the lens flare if you can).  if you're a treky it's a must see, but you have to be willing to overlook the significant overlap in plot line.
0783116934|5.0|This is one of the most compelling dramas I've ever seen, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more spine-tingling.  The performances of Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland are award-worthy.  The settings in the bleakness of the Soviet Union add to the atmosphere.  I can't recommend it too highly, but this is not for the kiddies.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|didn't think I'd like this series, but low and behold I love it,  I'm now watching it for the second time,  lots of thing I missed first time.
B008ROH07W|4.0|Despite having many CD's of classical trumpet performances, I'd never heard Alison Balsom before.  Amazing!  I prefer the Handel selections to the Purcel, but that is just my taste.  Her virtuosity is clearly apparent and I look forward to hearing her other CD's.
1781162646|2.0|As other reviewers have commented, this is certainly something different from King.<br />Whether that's good or bad is more tricky<br /><br />The novel deals with Devin Jones, a heart broken college kid spending the summer working for Joyland, a North Carolina amusement park. Still wounded from his breakup and the death of his mother at a young age, Dev finds himself in an amusement park with a dark past. Is the Haunted House haunted? Who killed that girl? And is the killer still at large?<br /><br />This could have been such a good book. I wanted it to be a good book.<br />But, sadly, it isn't.<br /><br />What's wrong?<br />First of all, King is clearly trying something new here. And not just trying to fit the hard case crime genre.<br /><br />There are at least two major, related problems.<br /><br />First of all, the novel takes far too long to &#34;take off&#34; (and I'll argue it never takes off at all). The first 100 pages are dedicated to nothing more than the characters small lives and the daily chores of working at an amusement park.<br />100 pages of running ferris wheels and the nitty-gritty of the job.<br />100 pages of the main character finding lodgings and bonding with fellow workers.<br />At one point two vital characters are set-up, then sent away only to return 40 pages later. Why? It seems pointless, like so much of this text.<br />Was King trying for a more literary effort? Something akin to Roth or Updike? The &#34;horror&#34; seems scaled down and confined to a few pages.<br />But simply reducing the horror does not a Booker price-winner make.<br />We expect certain things of King. He either should deliver or write one hell of a different book (Like Rage or Road Work).<br /><br />We get the usual King sob-story of the dead mother and the little kid with psychic power. We get the romantic tales and the classic &#34;old man looking back at youth - scenario.&#34;<br /><br />This novel doesn't work. Why? Here's my view: It doesn't work because we have to reason to care for these characters. 100 pages of &#34;non-action&#34; is great if the writer is J.D. Salinger or Breece D'J Pancake.<br />I found myself bored.<br />I started skimming, tired of amusement park chores and no real suspense. When would the action get there? When would King start?<br />The ending is fairly interesting, but sadly it's too late.<br /><br />Other's will disagree. But this book is the first complete dud by Stephen King I've read. I wanted to like it, but King gave me no reason to.<br /><br />Don't buy this book. I've never said this, but I'm saying it now.<br />Buy the Dead Zone, Salem's Lot, Road Work, Bag of Bones. But not this.<br />It COULD have been something truly great. A great bitter sweet tale of darkness.<br />But it just ain't.<br />It just ain't....
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This album was really good. Much different but I loved it very much. Highly recommend to be this album. Eminem is a true genius.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My young son and I &#34;nap&#34; on a blanket on the floor while watching this peaceful, beautiful movie on many winter afternoons. We both love it. It sparks his imagination and I love watching his eyes light up as the movie progresses. You will be glad you made this purchase. It's a treasure to be enjoyed for generations.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have been a whetstone user for many years and always sneered at this kind of sharpening tool, but this thing is amazing. It will restore an abused pocket knife edge in about 30 seconds. The flip-out rod does a great job of straightening and sharpening serrations. I have recommended these to all my friends.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Most of this novel surprised me with the author taking so much with the details of selecting a jury and then being ambushed during the trial.  Was the author giving the reader a taste of selecting and processing the a jury.  With high hopes of finding the jury for his client only to discover all is not well!<br /><br />What would have been the results if they<br /> did not<br />` find the lost brother?
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|great kids movie! we really enjoyed it! came perfectly packaged and in excellent like new condition! Would recommend for any family!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A fun and challenging game. Can't wait to get to the next step to see how fast I can get through it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great intermingling of characters lives. Everything comes back full circle and the final chapter is a great way to end the book with an entirely different outcome. Makes you think..what if...
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This series of books need to be read in order.  City of Ashes grabs you at the start and never lets go.  Lot of turns and twists, full of surprises.  I'm on to the City of Glass and will be a little sad when I finish the entire series.
B00FLNRN06|4.0|Great movie used the f word to much! Would have been 5 stars if not for that but still good.
0802473156|5.0|Better than I expected! We used this book in out couples class at church and we had a ball learning it!! Great, easy to understand information and easy to implement.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!!!!!!!!!! Xox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It is so much fun to play especially if you have a long wait time somewhere. Awesome
031624662X|4.0|I read a lot of science fiction and this book had some interesting stuff in it that I haven’t seen much in other sci-fi.  The way Leckie has dealt with artificial intelligence and how one system can see and interact through multiple vantage points is fascinating.  When I first saw how this book was going to play out I thought jumping from one view point to another, yet staying with the same character in those different points of view, would be confusing (just writing that sentence was a bit confusing).  What surprises me is how well Leckie pulls it off and how it doesn’t come off as confusing at all.  That isn’t to say it feels natural to read those sections, something feels a bit off as you get into the mindset of an Artificial intelligence, but I think that was part of the point.<br /><br />On that I also really enjoyed how she wrote a fully sentient and semi-emotional Artificial Intelligence.  It did not feel like Leckie just took human characterization and tagged it as being an AI.  The character of Breq felt very unique and well thought out.  Breq’s personality felt similar enough that you could relate and sympathize yet different enough that I bought the character as an advanced AI.  The other stand out character was Anaader Mianaai, the Lord of the Radch.  I don’t want to give anything away, but the internal conflict within the antagonist being used as a plot point was interesting.  I really wanted to learn more about what was happening with Mianaai, so much so that I was not pleased when the book shifted away from that point back to present day Breq’s journey.<br /><br />The one down side I had with the book is something I have been seeing more and more, well two things actually.  The first is the shifting time line, from present day to flashback.  I don’t mean just having a flashback, but when a quarter to half the book is flashback and the story jumps from one to the other multiple times.  It might be that I just prefer a more liner story but this does bother me some.  The other, and I find it usually goes hand in hand with the shifting time line, is when the author doesn’t make it clear what the point of the story is for large portions of the book.  It wasn’t until I was almost half way done reading the book that I knew what Breq was doing or what it’s goals were.  Because of this I never really latched on to the “current time” Breq.  I found myself connecting more with the flashback version of the character whose actions and intent were actually clear.  To be fair after the half-way point in the book those two versions catch up to each other and merge, but I don’t like waiting half the book for that to happen.  I know authors like to get clever with their structure so the book is “interesting” but this format has been done to death over the last few years and I would be happy if it went away.<br /><br />This is a really great sci-fi read and if you can handle the switching viewpoints it really is very inventive and feels new.this does bother me some.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The simplicity of this device and its price is amazing.  However, the performance seems to be less than stellar.  Unless you choose 480p (instead of 720p) it will occasionally disconnect or it will be jerky.  And I have a high quality 5Ghz 802.11n WiFi access point - and both the Chromecast and my laptop are only 3 meters away from each other.<br /><br />It would be great if other applications could connect to the chromecast... like VLC.  I also don't like how it adjusts the Chrome window - if I have the window maximized, connecting to chromecast will adjust the window a tiny bit.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Love this series. It's a little hardcore for the average viewer, but the story line is well written and Katy Sagal rocks this character.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I was expecting more considering the high reviews overall. The writing style is very basic and not necessarily better off for it. The metaphors are strange and the attempts to connect loose ends at the conclusion are somewhat disingenuous.<br /><br />The story and characters themselves would have been much more believable if they weren't inflated so routinely by the author, who seems to believe as children do, that children are the &#34;best ever&#34; at what they do. As far as Sci-Fi goes, the Ender Game does a poor job at convincing it's readers that this is a real place with real problems. The conflicts between the main character, Ender Wiggin, and his school mates is interesting at first. Yet, they ultimately reveal that the protagonist will never really stumble along the way. He always wins. The result is something a bit stale and predictable. The twist at the end is decent, but considering the weak and unbelievable characters the reader has been exposed to along the way, it is not nearly as impactful as it could be otherwise.<br /><br />In a few words: I was disappointed. I came into this with high expectations only to read a story that seems to have been written by a young adolescent that had not yet hit puberty.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|The talking dog is so much fun. Ben and tom are my favorite talking animals and the stuff they can do are fun
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|loved the movie even though it was in Italian the English words were put up on the screen.  It was a love story in a terrible time.  Love is more powerful than death.  The story of the human spirit rising above evil and cruelty The story of a man's love for his son.
B008M721MS|2.0|Skype used to work beautifully but ever since an over all Kindle update it crashes like crazy, stops randomly or glitches out to the point I have to sign out. What happened to Skype it used to be a good thing....clearly someone f-'ed up badly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game I enjoyed it and will play again.<br />The levels are challenging and the graphics are pretty good.<br />I will recommend to others.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I hate how Thomas dies but other than that a great book<br />If they had pictures on the drivers it would be greater
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is a great app, First of all its fun and entertaining, but, it also teaches you how to play different songs. I love that you can search for songs, and they usually come up. Then they teach you to play it. This is a great app for people at all ages. Thumbs up!!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|The way that they ended the season and other such gory events. Too bad. Season 1 and 2 were good.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Every time I get bored then I started to play it and it's my God how much they do so in was thinking to myself ITS EPIC
B00003CX8Y|5.0|It showed up earlier then I expected and it works great I would have no problem ordering something off of here again
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Very disappointed to see graphics geared to children  although the game is somewhat challenging. Some explanation regarding bonuses would,be welcome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was amazing I wish that the writer would continue in the series to show their life with the kids. And there love life it give me hope :)
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love mahjong all mahjong. This game has a good variety of puzzle layouts. Easy to see when you pick a tile and if you can't pick the tile. Many hours of fun with this
B006JD48NM|5.0|I first heard about this film whilst watching Formula 1 racing on Speed TV last season and have been looking for it for a while.  I could get grey imports and Region 2 copies but finally got my hands on a region 1 copy.<br /><br />Was it worth the wait.  Definitely yes.<br /><br />The documentary details the life of Ayrton Senna, from his early childhood days in carting up through his tremendous formula 1 career and his legendary battles with Alan Prost right through to his life ending crash during the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994.<br /><br />I've now watched the documentary twice and will likely go back to it again in the future.<br /><br />If your a formula 1 fan or even just have a passing curiosity in racing then Senna is for you.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I bought this action figure as a gift for my little son , he has been a fan of Sailor Moon since he was 12 years old , when he received his gift , he was jumping and yelling like a 4 year old with a new toy, now he is 30years old. That brought tears to my eyes, and made the figure totally worth it!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I loved the book because it was a maybe true story about what the future might be like. I would totally re-read this book again to get the experience about the world that they live in.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Ever since I heard about \\"the girl who was shot by the Taliban\\" in the news, I had been following her story.  And when I heard Malala had a book coming out, I immediately preordered it.  I found this book to be far more than a biography on Malala, and her dream of making education available to all boys and girls in the world. I also learned more about Pakistan \\"from the other side of the fence,\\" and about Malala's beloved Swat Valley.  Malala presents her story in a surprisingly objective manner that both complements and criticizes friend and foe a like.  Peace seems as much of her goal as education.  The pictures at the end of the book were nice too--to see the people and places she had been talking about.  I just wonder though, if Malala does indeed return to Pakistan someday, and decides to follow in the footsteps of her hero, Benazir Bhutto, will she end up facing the same fate?  But then if there's one thing \\"I am Malala\\" makes clear, her conviction is stronger than fear.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This backpack is great for keeping your lenses and the compartments were really well designed, so room for stuff is maximized within its volume. Besides from your gear there's room for other basic stuff (I usually take a book, sunglasses, small stuff)<br /><br />It comes with a LOT of stuffing to protect your gear and the partitions are all reorganizable, which is great, as they have velcro on their sides. Partitions are hard so the backpack isn't soft and your gear can't go rolling around in it and if you put a little weight on top of it, it won't get saggy.<br /><br />The material seem to be resistant to humidity like soft rain and etc (I can't really say it goes beyond this point as I wouldn't take so many chances just for the sake of reviewing my purchase LOL) so it's good for taking your camera to all sorts of places.<br /><br />The only downside (and I think someone mentioned it before on previous comments) is that the straps are kinda short. It's just that the backpack doesn't really fit wider people. I, for instance, have wide shoulders. I'm an average/big guy and the backpack kinda looks like a toy if I'm wearing both straps. And if I use their full length, the neck strap gets really close to my throat, so I just don't use it.<br /><br />But, for its price and its room, I would give it 8/10. It's really a good purchase.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I remember discovering Mr Hitchens only 7 or so months before he became sick. I was enthralled and in awe of him and how he spoke and wrote. I am a Christian so I allowed him his views as I do with people of other faiths. Anyway, reading this book about his fight with cancer was as if I was listening to him speak. If you respect Mr Hitchens for any reason, I would think you would love this book. Sad...
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|This was a very &#34;dark movie.  Now I will wonder every time I fly, if my pilot has these issues.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|There isn't much more I can add to the reviews already posted except to say that I enjoyed every bit of this book.  Oh how I hope there will be other 'Projects' written by Mr. Simsion!  Definitely not your ordinary book thank goodness!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is great I highly recommend it for those who love thinker games. its hard to put down I cant wait for The Room 2 to be out. its not a really long game but well worth 2 bucks
0385743564|5.0|It was a very action packed book with surprises at every turn. It has lots of interesting characters and they all have their own unique personality.  There is lots of description and you get a good feel of what is going on.  There is some good humor in this book but it is not enough to take anything away from the story.  I liked the whole story line and especially loved all the surprises. This is one of my favorite books I am so excited for the second book to come out.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|it was a great fast moving movie. enjoyed very much. kept me watching to see what happened, even though I had heard the story before.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I loved the movie. I am a fan of giant mechas since pretty much I can remember, and seeing this on the big screen, well it took me to my 6 year old self.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I originally downloaded this app to help get a piece of music out of my head and onto paper. I have really enjoyed this app. Best part is, the &quot;free cloud sharing&quot; section of the songbook has the angry birds theme!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It found that downloading and installing the App was very easy. Also,  downloading books is a very simple process.  The reading app is intuitive, just swipe and the pages turn.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and addictive. Challenging but solvable. A great anytime game. Good graphics and fresh ideas. Very easy to play and challenges the mind.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|the CG I looked so fake. it not a movie I'd watch again. waste of money glad i didn't buy it. :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is fun and I love it keep you relax, it is a good game to play when you by your self.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This album is the best! Worth every penny and then some! It's the mature words of a father and a son. He just keeps getting better and better.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|The title of Cain' s book immediately captured my attention when I saw it in the hands of a fellow passenger on my flight. I was still reluctant to buy the book unknown, and appreciated being able to sample it on my kindle. It didn't take too long to know I wanted to read more.  It was therefore puzzling when I realized that the book was no longer going anywhere, but seemed to be stuck in a loop of anecdotes about researchers and the author's acquaintances. I could sometimes spot the introvert Me, but by the end of the book can't say that I learned anything especially noteworthy.  It was a different topic at least.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The series is wonderful, i was shocked at the ending and upset for a time but the ending has grown on me and I find that it is very bittersweet. The unique ending is what makes the book so great because that is what makes the series so different from all the other books, I mean most books don't have endings like that, at least the ones I have read.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Sebold deserves more than five stars for this book. The victim of a brutal rape could hardly be described as lucky, but through the power of writing Sebold eventually got her life back.  This book is about her rape, in graphic detail. Normally I would not choose to read a book that is depressing, but as the title suggests, this is a memoir with a difference. Sebold  wrote with such skill I could hardly put the book down.
006202406X|4.0|Third of a series.  Bought for my daughter who has read the other two in the series.  She says, &#34;Took a lot to get into it, but good book.&#34;

B001AQMBJQ|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son.  It came promptly and in good condition. I know he loved and appreciated it.
B001BANK32|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan as long as I can remember. I own his books in hardback, paperback, audio and Kindle format. This story is one of his best and it is creepy and scary. The story in the book for me was better than the movie but both are 5 stars. I will not do any spoilers as there are so many good reviews.  You should know that this is a book worth getting.<br /><br />If you are a King fan then this book has to be in the top 5 or 10 of his best. I enjoyed reading it.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my Grandson.  It really looks good with a fun cover on it.  Good price too!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is fun, but you can only go so far before it starts charging you. So much for free!  Won't be downloading anymore free apps again.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|A great collection of hit songs from Seether throughout their career. If that wasn't enough they also included songs that were only  released on soundtracks and they even threw in a few new tracks. This is a great album for Seether fans, especially those that might have missed their contributions to their soundtrack only songs.
0394827996|3.0|My great- grandson really liked this book. It is a fun story, good for the three-year old mind.<br />We enjoyed it very much.
B00F5HWC7W|5.0|As a big time Killers fan I bought this album just to get the two new tracks and it was worth it. Even though I have all their albums, listening to their collection of hits all at once was absolutely fantastic, and getting two bonus tracks was a delight.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Well done. Great fight scenes. Good story as always. Overall great movie. There wasn't a time where I wasn't looking at the tv. Eyes were glued. Great in 3 D as well.
B00CABLXU8|5.0|Great album. Not only are these girls hot, but their music is great to listen to. Their pop songs are catchy and the album has several tracks that are top notch and would be considered great singles.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to set up. I find I am using more than my Sony Google TV box. It is very handy to control from my Samsung S4 phone. Netflix and You Tube work great.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Avril Lavigne does it again with this fantastic release! A great album with plenty of delightful tracks to listen to throughout the album, Avril Lavigne's beautiful voice shines through on this energetic album. What I really like about Avril Lavigne is that she takes her time making an album. She doesn't release an album once a year. She releases one after working hard on the writing, producing, and arrangement, and then releases an album. You can tell she did great work with all of that and surrounded herself with talented people to make this album such a delight to listen to.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I fell in love with the series and read the first two books incredilbly fast and could not wait until the third book would be released a year from when I finished the first two. I had kept up on the authors website in anticipation for any information I could get on the third book prior to its release. The author had voiced she was taking her time because she wanted to end the series right. My opinion is that this was not a bad book, but the ending is just not what most people would like to read, however, I think that the ending was more realistic, realistically there would be casualities in scenarios such as in the book and being a likeable or main character will not make you immortal. What I didn't like about the book is the series started out being more based on Tris as the main character and ended more based on Four. The constant switching back and forth from Tris and Fours point of views was confusing, as sometimes I couldn't remember whose point of view I was in until something would trigger and remind me. I feel that maybe the publishers pushed this author because the events were not that eleborate or clever, especially when the author voiced her opinion she wanted to take her time. Overall, the book was good and I am still glad I read the series, I really hope this doesnt effect the turn out to the first movie, though, as I would like the entire series to make it movie and just not the first book.
B00ERH15WY|4.0|Nice take on holiday songs from a great punk-rock band. The album is a great listen because the music is what you've come to expect from Bad Religion, except with a holiday twist.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This series had so much potential. The last book was a mess. The split perspective left me disconnected. The ending was pointless and rushed. I hated it. This would have been a series that I reopened often. Not now. It might have also been one to assign a classroom of students for discussion---rich with topics. No way that can happen now. Teenagers are fragile and this book left them the wrong message.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|It's fun and a good little puzzle game, but only worth it as the Faotd. Took me about 2 hours to play through completely while eating breakfast and watching a movie I have to read the subtitles to. :/ if there were more pictures available for free as well and included in the first addition of the game it might be actually worth buying. Sadly however There's only the easy pack available with this installation and to get higher levels you have to pay yet again.<br /><br />It is actually a good puzzle game which is why I gave other three stars. However, since you have to buy add instead and they want to suck you structure of every penny you have it only got three stars and I'll stick with &quot;eh.&quot; I don't regret downloading it, it made my morning a little bit more interesting.
0812968255|5.0|This is the best translation. I learn something new about myself every time I go back to it. Thank you, Mr. Hays.
0345803485|1.0|I don't write reviews...until now.  The books are tantalizing, in an adolescent way.  I simply wanted to see what all the hype was about.  To see if there was a plot.  And simply put, after reading the trilogy, I want a refund!<br /><br />Its a trilogy about unbelievable characters having sex.  Is there a plot?  Simply a woman falls in love with a man with issues.  The sex is redundant and comical.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great follow up work for a great book. Worth a read whether you read The Shining or not. I could not put it down.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The time at a quick glance, love it!~!  Sometimes - especiall in darker places where I can't see my watch, it is great to be able to see the time at a glance when using my Kindle, which I love love love!!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|It's a good and inspiring read about the heroism of these men who make huge sacrifices to keep everyone else safe.<br /><br />I'd give it more stars but the pace got a bit slow and tedious about 3/4 of the way.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Now I will know if I need to take a sweater, wear shorts, take a coat/unmbrella or WHAT?  So love a heads up.
B0052IEE8Y|2.0|The characters were not admirable, their dishonorable behavior was not pleasant to read about, and the ugly violence at the end was repellent. It would appear that FLW was quite the man whose feet were clay, and his treatment of other people was despicable. I prefer to read uplifting, inspiring stories about good people, but these people were selfish and destructive. Frank Lloyd Wright's work was accomplished at the expense of many others' feelings, lives, and sacrifices, so I have lost respect for him now.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you loved a Time To Kill you will love Sycamore Row. I had a hard time putting it down. I definitely think this book should become a movie. GREAT READ!!
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|nice not having to use energy to do missions or anything like that and it is a decent fun game to pass time and decent graphics
B000W9399S|5.0|Discworld has always been one of those series that I was peripherally aware of but, for some reason, hesitant to start reading. When the kindle versions went on sale, I figured it was time to take the plunge.<br /><br />Discovering just how big the series is was another shock, so I just grabbed the first three. By the time I finished The Color of Magic, I knew I was hooked. The writing is engaging, the pacing is perfect, and the humor is fantastic.<br /><br />I'm putting Discworld into my essential sf&f list, and you should too!
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book has essentially two themes: one about the 1980 Titan II missile explosion in Damascus, AR, and the other about the history of the United States nuclear weapons program in general.  The author pays special attention to the armed forces’ lack of regard for the safety of those weapons (either from intentional misuse or from unintentional accidents) that was the norm for the first half century of the American nuclear weapons program.  After reading the book, it’s hard not to take away a sense that major disaster was primarily prevented through sheer luck, as well as that accidents like what occurred at Damascus are not surprising, but rather inevitable.  In fact, what’s actually surprising is that such accidents didn’t happen even more often.<br /><br />Overall the book was well written and well researched.  While some of the information in it is cringe-worthy because it shows the reader just how often we got lucky instead of being good, the book is also an excellent stimulus for further thought and reading.  The author could have made a stronger case in favor of using human engineering, cognitive psychology, and other fields for improving these systems.  However, he did an excellent job of pointing out that systems errors, not individuals, are primarily responsible for these accidents.<br /><br />I also didn’t care for the organization where the sections went back and forth between the two themes instead of finishing one and then moving on to the other.  But it was easy enough to circumvent this annoyance by skipping ahead to read all of the chapters about the Damascus incident, then going back to read all of the chapters about the American nuclear weapons program.  I suggest reading it that way and in that order, as taking on each theme separately makes both of them much more cohesive.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|What a wonderful journey through the many fascinating intricacies of life. Dawkins may be a polarizing figure but that doesn't take away from the fact that he is a gifted explainer and a brilliant scientist. I would recommend this book to people on both sides of the discussion, both those who are already convinced that evolution is a fact and those who aren't.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. it has the largest cast of any show i have watched and each performance is extraordinary. the characters are moving and griping and i live & die with them in every episode. the show is a detailed study of the relationship between the aristocratic socialites and their lower class servants. studying the peculiar bond that these disparate social classes share as they live in close proximity day in and day out. the show starts in 1908 and as of season three has progressed up to the early 1920's. never have i witnessed a show with such scope and grandeur, and rarely have i seen a show with more heart and humanity.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|What is there to say about this collection of Bob Marley hits? Just put the album on repeat and relax into your chair. Now you know it's going to be a good day!

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|Bought as gift for a friend for Christmas.<br />Frome her lips to my ears..&#34;Exactly what she wanted&#34;<br />No complaints so far!
B001GJ3BR8|4.0|next to the directors cut of blade runner this may be the best directors cut i have ever seen. now that in no way means this is a great movie. what i mean is this improves on the theatrical version  of the film in almost every way. the plot is better and more cohesive. the characters make sense and we can under stand their motives. over all it feels like a real movie, not just a collection of loosely connected scenes like the theatrical move did.<br /><br />i hated the version i saw in theaters &  because of that i never gave this a chance. but with Affleck announced to play Batman i though i would give this a shot and i am glad i did!<br /><br />P.S. my one regret is that the abysmal seesaw fight is still in the film.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Nice light output, especially for the money, I would buy it again if needed, light is slightly whitish compared to others but thats OK
1400069289|2.0|The first two chapters or so are interesting and the chapter on willpower is also somewhat useful. The remainder of the book is filled with pointless corporate stories that are only tangentially related to habits. Overall it's a waste of time and money and provides little help for anyone wanting to learn about habit formation or useful ways of breaking habits.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Omg this game is the best game ever since I got it . I have not had this munch in years. And it is free get it why  it  Will not be for free for long because it is so fun.get this app.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Good 3D movie, Great story line, good action, funny. Great job at remaking the comic book story. Looking forward to the next Thor movie.. I would recommend this move to any 3D enthusiast.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|i like this mystery solving game. unlike others you can play a lot without having to invest money on it if you don't want to. you can if you don't mind, but i rather wait and have &quot;energy restored&quot;.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I found this book easy to get caught up in and clear to the end I found myself wondering what would happen on the next page. I love Grishams books!
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I don't write reviews often but I'm loving this app. Unfortunately, it's keeping me from studying for a very important exam on Tuesday. I like this app much better than the flip pix one the developer pur out because the controls seem more intuitive on this one. I prefer the CrossMe nonagram app to their flip pix but I haven't seen an app like this before and so have nothing to compare it against. I'm having a blast. No guessing yet, just pure logic. Definitely recommend.
B00EHMG358|4.0|Love the Preston Child books and this preview leaves you wanting more. Can not wait until this comes out to finish the book.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|This is Halloween, a classic, I watch it every Halloween, it is a family tradition now, a must see movie1
B009ZFPQOQ|2.0|I have problems with it force Closing often!  I also havent been able to connect with Facebook, is it cause I have a droid and not a Iphone? I love the idea behind it but I would like to see it in action before I can give it a real rating.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King does it again.  Good concept revisiting our favorite kid from the shinning all grown up now.  I hope this reaches a whole new generation of KIng fans.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The ending was such a huge disappointment, it sort of made me forget the rest of the book which was quite good.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|Great take on his wonderful music.  You may be hard pressed to figure out the original version of some of these songs!
B00FAIPDAE|3.0|Just started playing but seems fun. Just takes forever to build things and to speed it up it cost $
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|It's a decent album. To me it's one of those album that is overall good but nothing really makes you want to keep putting it back in your stereo.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very good book, one of his best works yet. Could not stop reading once I started, it reminded me a little of the &#34;Time to Kill&#34; in that it was hard to put it down.
B000023VR6|5.0|Classic to me, my first album when i was a teen. 10x better than the stuff being put out today by hip hop artists imo.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|It's a great album. I'm not even sure if I can write an unbiased review because I like it so much. The only thing is that some of these songs were on their last couple of albums (Christmas Favorites, We Are Love), but who really cares? I won't complain about getting more Il Volo. Also their take on Santa Clause is Coming to Town is fantastic.
B009NH6JRE|3.0|Was really hype about this season... was not for next. Started out nice and then about after half way everyone just gets kind of annoying and i kind of wished they all would get killed! Except daryl and maggie. The second half was just boring! I was on the season finale and didnt know it was the season finale.... disappointed!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a good game... makes you want to play... it's easy... and got to have good eyes to find a couple of things..
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Very nice album. Its refreshing to listen to when all you hear on the radio is mainstream crap. Good listen!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I did like it. The author really put a lot of thinking into it. As a teacher I recommend this book and I also like your sister Patricia Palacio.Thank you for making this book.How do you do this.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|It arrived in great shape and I binge watched it shortly after it came. I think it's a great season opener.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and my mom will love playing it when I give her the Kindle HD for Christmas.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|This book was terrible. I knew who the killer was from about 20% in. The main character is unsympathetic. She is a mess. This book glorifies so many things that need to be fixed in the world. I can't believe that anyone would rate this high. I was disgusted.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is something to think about I dream about playing it with my children your can get lost in with the game truely it's worth every penny
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book good series! This is my favorite one of the series! Rereading and can't wait for the movie release
B0083Z614S|5.0|I think this book would suit a young adult as the story moves to an enjoyable conclusion and keeps the reader interested
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Very interesting from cover to cover. Lots of points that were almost too good to stop reading.  Took many extended lunches when reading this.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have enjoyed using this website for all research. It appears to be fast and accurate. Good for all gorms of research
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fairway Solitaire is one of the best card games I have played. It can be addicting, so you have been warned. A good pastime for relaxing.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Fun video especially for beleaguered parents of large families. Emma Thompson is precious. Warning: your kids might learn some new ways to drive you crazy.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Kind of cool little app. Just needed something simple and this does the trick. Plus it's free. Go for it.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Angry birds, make me angry at the piggies. I have to put it down. I have all of the angy birds and keeps me busy and entertained while waiting for my husband or just want a break from reading.  Star wars is the best
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Enthusiastic, hilarious, and wonderful movie about positive attitudes, love and hard work. It is in fact a great movie to enjoy with the family.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great free shooter. How can you beat free? You can't. Right? The last time I saw an app this good was never.
B003YTPS7O|5.0|I really loved. It is very interesting, funny and romantic. Love the views and the difference between cultures make it very interesting.
1401308201|5.0|This book does a great job of reminiscing about the musical which I enjoyed tremendously. The pictures bring it all back.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This book snatched me in and held me captive from page one. The anticipation and suspense was invigorating. The story was well written, well executed and well worth my time. Bravo! Thanks for a great read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|when I play this game I thinkabout temple run. this game is so fantastic. this is very addicting. my sister play this all the time.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Stupid. It goes as everything opposite in the last two movies, the suit falling apart all the time and the power source not being in his chest? I mean, come on! They were trying to end this in a 3 movies stint and they did so all right. Anyone who's a comic fan is probably as disgusted as I am.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Steven King did a great job putting together the extended story and was able to tie it into the shinning. This was yet another masterpiece for one of the greatest writers of all time.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Excellant product. I can use this to charge my cell phone my kindle fire my daughters ipad mini..Totally worth the money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I;m addicted to this game. I can't say enough about how much I love this game. i loved the movies and I love the game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed his book.  It was well written and kept me reading.  I liked the ending very much but found it emotionally hard to read.
0143120530|5.0|If anyone gives less than five stars for this book then they are idiots. it's that simple. okay, four stars at least. but this book is actually scientifically helpful, not like a lot of self help books that get you pumped up and then do nothing afterwards. the proof is in the pudding - no normal person can remember thousands of things like these memory guys do. I have used the memory palace method to remember japanese kanji. for years it was too much. now after studying for just a bit and I don't even need to review the memory palace, the kanji get hard wired into my brain, whereas before it was a struggle to remember even a few. this book is actually useful, and the guy is a good writer so it is easy to read. I recommend it 100%.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I am in love with the show Nashville and so happy that they released a CD of the songs that play on the show.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very interesting story. Based on real events it kept me reading. I didn't want to put it down. A very good read!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|The experiments works, well they did for me and it was an easy to read book. I am now using the concepts in this book to improve my life and I'm getting the answers (maybe not the answers I want, but I'm getting them). It's definitely a great little book to have. I would recommend having this nifty little book in your collection.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|If you have any interest at all in American history, this is a don't miss book.  It is amazing how many significant events happened in this one summer.  I loved Bryson's humorous Walk in the Woods, and while this is completely different book, it is a well researched and fascinating look at a very unique time in America.
B005LAII4E|4.0|ANOTHER GOOD MOVIE, BOTH MY WIFE AND I LIKED IT ALOT. IT'S NOT TO MANY MOVIES THAT DWAYNE DOES IS NOT GOOD
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Awesome set! My son was so excited to get it. It is a micro world so it was a little more challenging than he is capable of so I had to put it together. There is no STEVE in the set which was disappointing to him too.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|ANOTHER GOOD MOVIE, DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ENOUGH FOR ANY MORE AFTER THIS ONE, IT MIGHT BE PUSHING IT SOME
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Incredibly busy year from a historical point. Charles Lindburgh, Babe Ruth, Henry Ford, Richard Byrd, Sacco and Vanzetti, Mt Rushmore, Al Capone, Jack Dempsey, Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Morrow, Herbert Hoover, the expansion of radio, the development of television, the end of silent films because of the development of talking pictures, the practical expansion of aviation for commercial purposes, racial &#34;cleansing&#34; in America, and on and on. A very interesting read, for those interested in history.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|It's alright, but starting to get tired of Zombies hao many zombies can rule the world???? I'll have to read the small blurb closer
1612680011|5.0|I have started reading a lot of finance and &#34;back to basics&#34; type books recently and this one has been my favorite. He tells a story of his life and what it was like to become &#34;financially literate&#34; with the help of others and education. This was a fun and easy read. The book motivated me to learn more about finances and really take a deeper look at how I view assets and liabilities. If you don't know where to start this is a great place. The road to wealth or living comfortably takes a lot of work and patience. Robert Kiyosaki makes getting started feel easy and fun. I wish I had read this book earlier in life. Let the journey begin.
B008JFUPZI|5.0|I REALLY LIKED THIS ONE, LOTS OF ADVENTURE, ACTION, JUST A REALLY GOOD MOVIE. IT WAS MADE SO YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE THERE.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I thought this was a good start to a new series, but not great, though the series could be.  The plot seemed to advance too quickly and I thought the twists were fairly easy to see coming.  All that said I enjoyed the book and will read the next one when it comes out.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|This story draws you in and keeps you in. Franco continues to be the most interesting and talented young actor around!<br /><br />g
B00EK3EFEA|5.0|This an amazing talent. Great songs, great voice, great production. Hopefully, the star making machinery is working overtime to make her one.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Sorry to busy listening to this great album to type a long review. They are back, sounding better than ever. Support these guys and buy their music.
B00G32TD98|4.0|Ok so my tastes in movies are changing.  Even though I cant take horror/thillers anymore, I am trying to watch them to see if I can stop this stress or fear I have developed. Because I have always loved these movies!! I liked the the movie.  It was very good.  Only hid my face a couple times hahha.  Seriously though it was good.  Movies based on actual facts are always good to watch and enjoy!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is magic.  It took maybe 3 min. to set up and it works great on all our tablets, and notebooks - 5 devices.  Turns you wide screen TV into a computer monitor.  We have an older MacBook that we connect to a wireless keyboard and my nearly blind mother in law can do email and word processing on the big TV with no problem.  It just works great.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|A great fun movie with a lot of action stars and a lot of action in other countries.  See it!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|My 10 year old boy liked the movie, otherwise I would have given it 2 stars. There were too many scenes where it felt like the writers just wanted to make something happen (to support the story line) and didn't really care about the details of how the scene was shot. For example, our hero Brad and his co-star (some Israeli army gal) are on a plane headed somewhere, zombies take over the plane, while in flight of course, plane crashes and is shredded in a million pieces, every one of the 200 passengers are dead except for Brad, his gal, and one zombie stuck in a plane seat. Seriously? That's when I went to make some phone calls and let my kid watch the rest on his own.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|&#34;Oh My Goodness &#34; It has got all your old guys in a Great sequel to the first Expendables . Action packed with humor , and don't forget &#34; I'll Be Back &#34;  You won't be disappointed :)  Five Star *****
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This book is great! It was a perfect finale to the twilight saga. It was captivating and made you want to stay up all night and read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Sooooooooo much fun. Everyone should get this game. I absolutely love this game. Awesome  minions all  the way!!!! YEAH YEAH.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Perfect album in all ways----it's the Beatles, how could it be otherwise?  Even the least of their albums are jewels.<br /><br />Some misinterpret the re-appearance of such numbers as &#34;Glad All Over&#34; or &#34;Lucille&#34; on this disc (they also are featured on BBC 1) as repeats---they are not---simply they are different versions of those songs and therefore not identical in the performance.<br /><br />Hearing such BBC non bootleg debuts such as &#34;This Boy&#34;, with a phenomenal Lennon lead vocal, and &#34;If I Fell&#34; with its perfect harmonies is worth the price alone.<br /><br />A grand excursion from start to finish.  If you like the Beatles, you need this disc!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using this for year's and it's the  keyboard I rely on.  I put it on every device of mine. Only gets better with each update.
B002GHHHKQ|3.0|slow moving, I found it a bit boring, so I give it a just okay movie.<br />I prefer a movie with a bit more action.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy to dl to my iPad. Great & easy read. Nicholas Sparks was not a let down. Like they say, most books are a lot better than the movie.
B00000G3PA|4.0|A entertaining Movie, you kind of know what is going to happen.<br />It reminded me of Space Cowboys plot, especially the ending..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to use your mind and have fun doing it! I hope it continues! Im only on lervel 4!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Star Trek Collection<br /><br />I've been a Star Trek Fan for years, so it's nice to<br />have this collection.  I've seen them all before, now I can<br />look at them again and again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have Candy Crush Saga on my cell, computer & Kindle...love the game; grandkids love to play it when they visit.
B00005JMXX|5.0|suspenseful, and full of action.  I missed it when it was out, and was<br />glad I took a chance in purchasing it now.  A great movie.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|Had never heard of this group until a young friend handed me an earbud and said &#34;Have a listen.  i think you'll like these guys.&#34;  He was right.  I'm a fan of Metallica and various other groups of that genre, and Volbeat does not disappoint with it's clever mix of old rock, metal, rockabilly.......fresh new music and some very well done covers of unexpected classics.  The vocals are superb.  Have a listen.
0316044695|5.0|This is my second purchase of this book. I let someone borrow it in the past and it was never returned; obviously good enough to buy again! I'm not a book reader by any means, but this one is tough to put down and provides great insight into the sacrifices our Military makes for our freedoms! Intense!!!
B0045HCJGC|5.0|Yet another movie I used to own that I needed to have back in my library.  A spooky but positive outlook on the possible future we face......makes me hope people don't get that crazy with outlawing things!
1455525839|2.0|I guessed who the killer was about one-third way through and I agree with the other reviewer who said one of the main characters was an idiot.  I am an avid animal lover and I know it is make believe but I still don't like reading about animal abuse.  Spoiler - one dog was killed and then burnt up in a house fire and one dog has his head cut off.  That really turned me off.  After about halfway through I quit reading and went to end of the book to see if I was right about who the killer was and sure enough I was.  Believe me, I am not that smart so anyone  should have figured it out.  I have decided that these two authors are not for me so I will not be buying any more of their books.  I realize other people will love this book and so I say good for them.  Everyone to their own taste!
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Owned this movie years ago and missed having it.  Had to have it again.  Just a good old spook movie to entertain you on cold nights.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Despite being a big sci-fi fan, I had never gotten around to watching Doctor Who.  When I finally did, I began with Season 1, continued through all the newer seasons, then returned to watch the classic Who seasons.  After now having watched every episode available anywhere of all 11 Doctors, I believe this season is still the best option for anyone that has never seen Doctor Who but is interested in beginning their journey through time and space.  Season One takes the time to introduce you to the concepts of who The Doctor is, the Doctor Who universe, and does so in a modern television format.  Watching the newer Who first, even if it's just this first season, should get you a solid foundation from which you could then return and watch classic Who or continue on with the newer series.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I pick up a book from each new area that I travel through.  While in Barcelona, &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; was recommended to me.  From page one, I was hooked.  I quickly grew to care about the characters.  The pages made me laugh, they made me angry, and I didn't want the story to end.  &#34;The Prisoner of Heaven&#34; and &#34;The Angels Game&#34; are optional, in my opinion.  But, The Shadow of the Wind is at the top of my must-read recommendation list.
B0000042H4|5.0|wagner music is something great. the solti recorded of the Ring is just excellent. The sound is perfect. I really enjoy it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Nicely done makes me wonder why we all stopped playing. Oh yeah, working long hours, diaper changes and other diversions. Well now I can enjoy a round while sitting at my desk.
B000G75ANY|5.0|Bjork is one of my favorite singer. I like very much her work. Dualdisk are difficult to find in Switzerland.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|a real look at youthful indiscretion coming back to bite you in the ass. I was very glad that the author accepted responsibility for her actions. An easy read but a good one.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great writing as usual. Good story, great dialogue. Never disappointed with his work and this is no exception. One of those books you hate to finish.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Love the book.  What I don't appreciate is the fact that my Kindle Fire HD is holding the story hostage until I review it.  There is no other way to continue (either that or it is well hidden)!  Shame on you Amazon!  Review should be optional and voluntary, not coerced.  Thank you very much for making my three year old daughter wait for her bedtime story.
0385345054|5.0|This book is fabulous. The pictures are beautiful. The flowers are breathtaking. The instructions are great and easy to learn. I am truly impressed with this book. I'm glad to add this to my crafting library.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|Easy to setup and use. I can access it from my laptop, droid smartphone, IPad and Macbook Air. The software utilities you get from the web site are easy to use.  Had an issue with trying to upgrade to the pro version of WD Smartware, gave a strange, cryptic error. Haven't tried to follow up with tech support as yet. Other than that, it's a fine product.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were very interesting. I  can honestly say I had a hard time closing the cover on my kindle. I think I will have to read them again to make sure I didn't miss anything!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Walking dead is great. My wife can't get enough of the zombies. Great show. If you haven't seen it, you need too. The show gets better every episode
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was totally blown away by AMS Season 1 and this season didn't disappoint one bit.  A new setting and plot, but the resurgence of some of the same actors/actresses from season 1, made for a whole other horror experience.  Watching these are like watching the longest, most satisfying ghost stories one could hope for.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Great movie!! watching the preview all i was thinking oh great another robot and alien movie. Turns out this movie actually has a good story! watch!!!
B00G32OER4|5.0|One of the best ghost and excorcism films I've seen.  I love the actress who portrays Lorraine Warren- Vera Farmiga- who also plays the mom in Bates Motel and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  This one had me from beginning to…well, it still does.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Lovely set.  Additional material and appendices worth the price.  Only wish there was more.  Some additional content is really important in understanding and appreciating the larger story.
B000244FDW|5.0|Simply the best P&P version bar none. It is the one closest to the book with the absolute best Bennett family, the best Mr. Collins and Charlotte, a perfect Jane and Lizzie and a pretty awesome Darcy.<br /><br />I know that generally Darcy's portrayal in this version is seen as overly stiff, but if you read the book and you pay close attention to David Rintoul's performance you will begin to understand the subtle genius of his acting. Just as in the book and in keeping with the mores of the time period, his reactions are somewhat stilted, guarded, his interest in Lizzie covert, his outward manner indifferent. Very often Rintoul manages to convey his character's feelings through a simple twitch of his cheek or a slightly longer look but he is always proper in the 19th century British sense, always upright, never emotionally revealing.<br /><br />Mrs. Bennett and Mr.Bennett are played to perfection with a strong dose of wit and irony. Jane and Lydia are also particularly well portrayed as is Ms. Bingley whose jealousy and pettiness and attempts at manipulating Darcy and her brother are clearly displayed.<br /><br />Elizabeth Garvie's Lizzie is witty and playful, her demeanor in stark contrast to Darcy's haughty distant manner.<br /><br />Mr.Collins is absolutely delightful, portrayed in humorous manner, yet clearly showing his passive aggresive behavior towards Lizzie in the second part of the book.<br /><br />All in all you have to see this version if you are a true Austen fan. In my opinnion this version's main virtues reside in its subtlety and its fidelity to the original text, with wit and humour thrown in, just as intend by Austen's satirical portrayal of society at that time.<br /><br />I have found this version significantly better than the 1995 one whose two redeeming features are: 1. Colin Firth and 2. the locations.  The 1995 version is overtly romantic, which is probably why it is more of a crowd pleaser than the more subdued 1980 one, but it is not as faithful to Austen's work.<br /><br />I also really liked the 2005 version but although the characters were much better portrayed than in the 1995 version, the dialogue was modernized with elements that did not ring true to the original Austen text and the movie was made to be some kind of a Cinderella story with the Bennetts and the Darcys really far away on the social scale.<br /><br />My prefererences:<br /><br />1. Elizabeth Garvie & David Rintoul (1980)<br />2. Keira Knightley & Matthew Mcfadyen (2005)<br />3. Jennifer Ehle & Colin Firth (1995)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is amazing for the reason of having a MOBILE minecraft game the game works fine and im happy to pay 6.99 for it so i can play on long car trips so people who hate it you are missing out plus i made a two player world and played for 18 hours total with my friend so BUY THIS GAME :-) #fun
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not a bad app. Smooth play. Does everything it is supposed to. Keeps me occupied while my husband watches boring TV.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I feel like Amazon is spying on me... I had been looking at this game the other day because I already have the free one from the same company. I really like these kinds of puzzles so I really wanted to get another one but I didn't want to spend money on it. And now, just a few days later, it's the FAOTD! So I'm either very fortunate or very creeped out. Maybe it was my birthday present since my birthday was last week. lol<br />Anyhoo... These are great puzzles, they seem hard at first but once u get the hang of it it's really satisfying to complete one without hints or errors. The only bummer I found was that even though this is usually a paid app, it doesn't have that many puzzles. It probably has the same number of puzzles as the free one. I finished them all in 30 mins. It's probably still worth the price since it has a good replay value. I'm just a penny pincher. So I do recommend this app. Especially if u like to zone out and and distract your brain.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Totally different sound and being able to sing well and get noticed without having to stoop to gross crap (like you know who).
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I rated this 5 stars because I just couldn't tear myself away once I started reading it. I did go on line and buy all of them. If you love vampires you will love this series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its awesome you can create any thing you want! I mean anything literaly I love it! Totally 5 stars :-) :-) :-)
159463176X|4.0|Good book but not nearly as good as his first 2 books. Still glad I read it (for a book club) and all of the readers agreed that it wasn't his best effort.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|Filmed outdoors in Spain, this is an incredible performance.  The singing is out of the world and the acting is great. It's sung in French so if you don't speak French, use English subtitles.  This is one of the few videos where it it worth watching the credits at the end just to hear the singing!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I loved her blog and when it went quiet I felt bereft.  This book is filled with her wry observations and self-deprecating humor that drew me into her world. Allie Brosh is relateable and down to earth. She doesn't hold back in her observations of her life and experiences.<br /><br />The truth is, you either get or you look at the people who recommended the book as bat-$hit crazy.  That's okay. I'll take the later. Allie tells us there is hope through perseverance.<br /><br />On a technical note, this book has been beautifully formatted for the kindle app.  Thank you to Simon & Schuster for taking the time to get the formatting right.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great book by my favorite author, John Grisham.  This one has just become one of my favorites.  It was very hard to put down once I started to read it.  I look forward to his next publication.
B003XIIW2Y|5.0|Lent out my original set to a friend and I haven't gotten it back (yes, we are still friends). Love the series and love to be able to watch full episodes without commercials. The extras make this a great buy.
B00G32OER4|5.0|this is a must see for all horror fans. im going to have to watch it again. my kiddo loved it to :)
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A fascinating story which fills us in on the history of Pakistan and an insider's look at living under the Taliban before and after 9/11, followed by Malala's heroic recovery and mission to educate girls and women.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|so love this way too cute movie! ive got my kiddo hooked on it to now. I think I have created a monster :)
B00011CZRE|5.0|Perfect transaction, DVD in great condition. Movie is an oldy but always a goody.<br />It is a keeper! Thank you
B00F3VOL38|5.0|Very familiar tracks and very similar to Version One, from 1994, and that's okay with me. All tracks sound like their first two albums...just...the Beatles! All instruments clear as a bell...all later diffusion - a dream.<br /><br />Wonderful, insightful interviews with the players, ages 22-26: \\"new\\" fans might assume they were all 10 years older, at least, as they expand on many \\"domestic\\" things: homes, cars, kids. Funny that the least prevalent singing voice here, Ringo, has the most interesting confab with the host. He's really the only \\"pure\\" rocker..if his stint suddenly ended, he'd still be beating rhythmically on anything available and flat!<br /><br />Another fascinating point for me, in addition to the mature professional image of all four, is that these conversations certainly imply that they are all doing very well financially, and actually were doing so not long after they took a support role in the Little Richard tour of 1962. And of course before the first tour of the U.S.A.! Like their role model, Elvis, it does not hurt to have a very proactive manager! [Mr. Epstein].<br /><br />This Reviewer-Fan finds it hard to get excited over note for note copies of MISERY, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET, THERE'S A PLACE; terrific tunes, but decidedly lower down in the display case to gems like I'LL FOLLOW THE SUN and I FEEL FINE.<br /><br />The material herein inescapably leads to personal muse on what *another* Beatle album might have sounded like, say, somewhere between the official albums 2 and 3, with tunes like LEND ME YOUR COMB, GLAD ALL OVER, LUCILLE, SURE TO FALL, BEAUTIFUL DREAMER, I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT YOU, I GOT A WOMAN, etc.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|“Gravity” is a non-stop, nearly plotless thriller about the perils of working in earth orbit , with a little human interest thrown in. Practically from the first, spacewalkers George Clooney and Sandra Bullock (who cares about their character names?) were pummeled and tossed about like toys in the vastness of space. After their ship is disabled, they need to make it to nearby space vehicles if they are to have any chance to survive. We learn about halfway through the story that Bullock has endured a personal tragedy, explaining a) why she is so mopey and b) why we should care whether she makes it back to Earth or not. But the real star of the show is the effects. Somehow, evidently without using the Vomit Comet or hanging actors from strings, the movie makers perfectly capture the physics of working in space. Cables float around, spinning objects just keep spinning and satellites adjust their course with silent jets of gas. It's a marvelous, and completely convincing illusion of the perils that astronauts endure.<br /><br />As for the hokey personal growth story, with its tacked on tug at the heartstrings? Meh. The same for a handful of ridiculous scenes -- as when Bullock, marooned in a foreign spacecraft, randomly hits buttons hoping to get the thing to respond.<br /><br />But leave the sniping to Neil deGrasse Tyson. &#34;Gravity&#34; is an exciting ride, filled with visuals that you just won't believe.
0307352153|5.0|The author is an excellent writer and the topic is one that's close to my heart. See? There's nothing wrong with me! It's okay not to want to gab about inane things on Facebook or converse with everyone I pass in the street! Plus, I learned a few tips and tricks to faking extroversion when it just needs to be done.
B000002GZ1|5.0|One of the hottest bands in Chicago in the middle 60's.  So many memories and so many good times years ago.  they were a great band.
B00GB7GX20|5.0|I love it more every time I listen to it, and definitely more then the time before, and the time before that!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so much fun and is worth the seven dollars. It doesn't freeze much and has good graphics. This app is amazing!!
B00F35BV64|1.0|In an effort to both be its own film and retain the spirit of the original Star Trek, this reminds me of the old proverb, &#34;Chase two rabbits, and you'll lose both.&#34; Couldn't be any truer here.<br /><br />The real problem here is a gross lack of story. The more you think about it, the more you realize, not a lot happened during the film. If anything was *going* to happen, they rushed through it as fast as humanly possible to get to more CG action.<br /><br />None of the characters are really developed at all from the last film, and while Khan *looks* cool and Benedict tries really hard to give him character, the writing just gives zero room for it. We get the briefest glimpse into who he is and sort of what he's trying to do.<br /><br />But through and through, the film can't figure out what it wants to be. We don't really focus on anything in particular. We get a hodgepodge of characters, but they don't develop, they just act. Khan ends up as nothing more than a cartoon character. Virtually no exposition, no background, and not even so much as a hint of what the hell Project Genesis was all about. Benedict gets no opportunity to develop his character, or his relationship to his crew. What made the original so great is just, well, not there. They just don't follow that.<br /><br />Now, that would be perfectly fine if what they *did* follow was interesting. But it doesn't bother with that. There's so much nothing going on, it just doesn't ever amount to anything substantial.<br /><br />It truly feels like half a film, and they certainly don't even bother to hide that they're loading up for another sequel. But it feels like half a film because we get the action part of things, but none of the &#34;Why should we care?&#34; part of things, which is kind of critical.<br /><br />Kirk is Kirk, Spock is Spock, everyone's everyone from the first film. But there's no real development. There's a tiny bit with Kirk, but just not enough. And the switcheroo they pull for the twist feels horribly forced, and also a bit saccharine, killing off whatever chance for drama there could have been.<br /><br />It's really sad that nothing works here, which is simply because too little happens in such a long timespan. We get the Klingons literally for about five minutes (and they look ridiculous. Bright blue eyes? 'The hell?), we sort of get Khan *once* while he's talking to Kirk at one point for less than five minutes, and the rest is nothing more than nonstop action.<br /><br />Look, action is fine in any film. But you've got to give me a reason to *care* about what's going on. The whole film felt like it was leading up to something interesting, but it never does. It ends so abruptly and without much really occurring, with an ending that is literally nothing more than setting up the next film, that it can't accomplish anything.<br /><br />Very, very disappointing. Feels like one of those films that had enough executive meddling and arguing to the point that everyone conceded and got a *little* of what they wanted, but nothing added up at the end. If all you want is action with no drama or character to speak of, well, go for it. But if you sort of like to care the slightest bit about its characters (God help you if you saw Wrath of Khan already, because this whole film can't even get that one single character to be anything worth following), forget it.<br /><br />An extremely poor Star Trek film, new or not. The original Abrams flick was far superior in every possible department, and it doesn't do a thing for Khan's character or the original film. Just another generic action flick without anything substantial guiding it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is awesome. it works very well and no mistakes happen. doesn't freeze or anything like that. it is very useful.

B00992CF6W|3.0|It used to work for me and it was awesome but now it is lagging a lot and I don't know why, help me please, I don't get it
B00881VLCE|2.0|The bug I've got would get fixed.  When I first got this game it was great, then, it started glitching on me.  The puzzle pieces don't fit together correctly, when I find a piece that fits, the pieces are not fitted together properly.<br /><br />If they fix this bug, I'll give it 5 stars, but, until then 2 is all I'll give.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great second book LOVEDDDD IT<br />If you read the first book you will LOVE this book!!!!!!!!! READ IT characters  are great
B0037QM8YA|1.0|I know that there are people who don't know this sort of thing goes on, but this was disgusting and I broke it into little pieces and threw it in the trash, and then I prayed for the victims of such horrors.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|It was a okay book! I read it with my class and I thought it was a really nice and decent book!!
B001CZVVVO|5.0|Wonderful just wonderful Concert, so good to hear the voice of certainly one of my favorite Tenors, Mr. Domingo.<br />The other two artists need no praise whatsoever, the whole concert is wonderful, and well worth the money spent.<br />More singing from Placido, and maybe a little more singing, because at age 71 he still has a wonderful voice.<br />Once again a great DVD both Video and especially audio.<br />Sincerely.<br />Robert G. Brown
B00594XOZU|4.0|Well it is awesome except it just somehow said that it was like &quot;currently unavailable&quot; and I can't log on so now I can't use my kik. But besides that it is awesome and I love it!! I do recommend this app!!! :)
B007THA4FI|1.0|A big let down after the Harry Potter Series.  It was very difficult to get started and I didn't care for the story line.  What else can I say.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Every time I need to do homework and I lose my calculator I can do everything on here definitely a great choice
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I like a book that I can't predict the ending too.  At least not right away. I love surprise endings.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS A REAL FUN GAME...IT WOULD BE NICE IF I GOT MORE FREE STUFF TO PLAY GAME WITH OTHER THEN THAT I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I try to beat my best time each play and it gets harder and harder. But I'm up for the challenge.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Predictable but fun.  Nothing special, glad I did not waste my money at a movie theater but was worth seeing it at home.
B00DWZHTRW|3.0|SO SO, I WILL NOT RECOMMAND TO ANY ONE, BUT THE PREVIEW IS THE ABOUT THE BEST PART OF ALL MOVIES, EVERY ONE KNOW THAT FOR SURE, IT GUESS IT STILL ALRIGHT TO WATCH WHEN NOTHING TO DO.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Predictable but fun.  Nothing special. Story line was thin but lots of things blow up so I was happy.  Good at home got nothing better to do movie.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|GOOD , WE ALL LIKE IT.. SOMETHING DIFFERENCE FROM TRANSFORMER, WE CAN REPEATLY WATCH IT AGAIN, SOME HOW, WE FOUND SOME TIME  FUNNY, YOU FIND OUT YOURSELF.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Her lives come from a far-out direction.  Trying to make you own mode of looking at People apply to Munro's just doesn't work.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Amazing, bought it for GW2 and Skyrim, no more wrist problems + phenomenal game play. Warning: it takes some time to get used to, but keep using it and you won't regret it.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|I don't know what instructions MJD read but the ones I read clearly indicate that the dots on a tile describe the tiles AROUND it, not the tile itself. So if you have a tile surrounded by two other tiles and has one each white and yellow dots, one tile will be white and the other yellow. You must use logic to decide. Fun.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie was excellent.  Denzel is so sexy in this movie and not bad on the eyes. I think he should win an Oscar for his performance.  I highly recommend it.
B00B2166BS|3.0|It worked great until one of the magnets fell out.  The coupling is rather weak so don't let kids get around it unless you fancy yourself to be in my situation.
0913866156|5.0|Good deck.  Fine reproduction of the cards.  Nice small printed Book of Thoth included as the lwb (the little white book)
B003GQM52Q|4.0|I am not a big Kevin Costner fan but really enjoyed the movie. The sets, clothes and film editing is worth the watch.
B000YDG5W0|5.0|I usually where a size 10M in athletic shoes and other boots that I have.  For these I had to go down to size 9M.  Others have posted the same, from half size down or full size.  For me it was full size down.  Once you get the right size they are really comfortable and great for fall and winter.  I actually bought two pair.  One burnished brown and one dark brown.  Both are great colors.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can certainly appreciate a neurotic read, but this one was over the top. The ending is anticlimactic, and I found it simply annoying. However, it does hook you fast and keeps you engaged in the chaos until the bitter end.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|These dolls are all the rage it seems.  I bought this doll for my granddaughter & she loves it.  The tail came off but was easily reattached, I believe it's made to do that to change her clothes.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This is just one of those stories that could go on forever, and I would continue reading it until the end of time.<br /><br />It was sincerely the most enjoyable read I can remember in a VERY LONG TIME.<br /><br />This book made me laugh, cry, rinse and repeat.<br /><br />In many ways, I identified with Cath but also Wren, not to mention Reagan.<br /><br />I even found myself looking forward to the fanfic blurbs.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this book deserves FIVE STARS!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|My daughter and I own them all. Love Supernatural and all the characters. Dean & Sam Winchester are tough, sweet, and hilarious. If you're in the mood to watch some bad monsters get killed, buy it :)
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|I had not seen this film in a while,sort of forgotten all about it.I was sort of disappointed given the cast.A horror treat is was not.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun little game! Makes it very hard to put it down!  Can loose track of time easily playing this<br /><br /> game.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's not anything like Rambo and it's not about food.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|Joe does it well!  Several good songs including the title track. Very good guitar work and a good listening CD.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played but they to give you more energy. I would love to get real steel for free.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Helpful for at tradition attachments when you are filming in dry conditions. I have the external microphone so I needed the Skelton case. I also have the wifi attachment and I swapped out the back door. Now I have better sound and wifi for non-aquatic filming. I will use the non-Skelton case for rain/snow events.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow. I've read many authors and this is up there with the best. Echos  of rothfuss in approach and I personally love mainly retaining the viewpoint of the central character throughout. The depth draws you in. I almost stopped a couple of times because I was annoyed with the characters choices, but I was always glad I persevered.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Holy Crap! Holy Smokes!...What?...I can't believe it! Can I give this more than 5 stars?  If you have the time to soak up this large novel, do it now, don't wait.  I was actually upset when it ended as I wanted more story. Maybe even another trip back to try again (read the book and you will understand).  My previous favorite books by King were The Shining and The Stand.  This book easily jumped to the top 2 in my list.  It was not a horror novel but a great story by the greatest storyteller of all.  I told all my friends that I would love to see the outline that King had in order to make timelines mesh and to make sense of it all.  It would be impossible to write an adequate review in a small space that people would read.  It's that complex and that good.  This novel will surely go down in history as one of King's best.  What are you waiting for? Download it now!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was really Suspenseful! I am Ready to see the movie! It was Bit of a cliff hanger though! !

B0074MZSWW|5.0|I absolutely love this album! Definitely my go-to in the car! Brittany Howard has an amazing voice!! This is such a cool band, and I love that they're from my home state!! I will definitely be purchasing any future albums Alabama Shakes release!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is pretty easy to get the hang of and has lots of fun and challenging levels to enjoy. Decipher codes, solve puzzles and escape each room with a sense of achievement. This is one of the best escape games and is a must have for any puzzle addicts out there.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Hands down an incredible movie the visual effects and story line including costumes made it the best superman ever!!!! A must see movie for all
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|When I downloaded the app.  I can  hear the music playing, but the screen was black so I uninstalled it and reinstalled the app.  same problems fix it please I have a kindle HD if it matters
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first two books were better, but it was good to read the last and have the conclusion of the story.  Overall, not a great book, but an entertaining read.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like this game a lot.  The graphics are very realistic and so is the way you have to continue to adjust your aim.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Hedwig is an awesome rock musicall.  It's a must-have for anyone who loves 80's punk and for LGBT advocates.  A beautiful movie with some fun, really sing-able songs.  One of my favorites!!
B009GEYX5E|5.0|Love these! It makes me reminisce on the old polaroid days! It came with tips on how to develop properly since this film differs from original polaroid film, extremely helpful!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I bought the book 1 - 3 bundle, and I just finished book 1.  Can't wait to get started on the next two.  Enjoyed the story line and the fascinating twists in the plot. This was my first book by Morgan Rice (no relation to myself) and I am sure I will be working my way through the rest of the series! I also have the audio book version of A Quest of Heroes. Books I really enjoy get read/listened to more than once and these will certainly be the case.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is fun and addictive to play, but very ANNOYING when it only gives you 5 lives at a time and then expects you to wait for new ones or PAY $$$ to get more.  I guess in a way that's a good thing because it makes me put it down.
0393327345|4.0|Fight Club Review<br /> For our English class we had to pick a book and have a book club. My group chose Fight Club. For the most part everyone enjoyed the book. It is definitely a very “special” piece of literature.<br /> By “special” I mean weird, like no other book I have ever read. Let’s just say the book is not the best bed time story for your little ones. It contains plenty of adult subject matter that I would rather not get into because it can get a little nasty.<br /> The overall gist of the story is, that there is a man who does well for himself but after his apartment blows up starts to think about philosophical questions like what is the point of life. He says things like, “You do the little job you’re trained to do. Pull a lever. Push a button. You don’t understand any of it, and then you just die.” (Palahniuk2). His answer is to experience pain and suffering so he goes to support groups for all different types of cancer patients and then starts a fight club. This all happens while he is living with two very interesting characters in not so great conditions.<br /> In conclusion, Fight Club is a decent read but it might not be right for some people. I enjoyed the book along with most of the kids in my book club. It has a very interesting story line but it can get confusing at some points. It was also extremely weird. It was weird due to the fact that I had never experienced or read any other books like this. Therefore it was a “special” piece of literature that was good but might not be for everyone.
B000U7XUKK|5.0|One of those albums that kick your ass when you weren't expecting.  Every song is a gem.  Highly recommend and buy for presents as well.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Video quality is good but the audio is low.  Dialogue was often difficult to hear and understand.  On the plus side movie played without any problems, no pauses or buffering.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|11/22/63 is a long captivating book, it has an astounding creative plot, where historical and fantastic fiction mix, this requires talent and top notch author SK has got what it takes.<br />Jake Epping is a divorced HS teacher in Maine, he uses to eat at a diner place, its owner, Al, is sick with cancer, teetering on the brink of the death, and reveals Jake a secret, the diner's pantry has a time hole, if you step in, you will travel back in time to 1958 America. Al has already experienced it himself many times, and returned to the present<br /> Al asks Jake if he can go back in time to prevent the assassination of JFK, he had done a research of the scene, and hands Jake a blue notebook containing his conclusions, from then on a very gripping thriller unfolds<br />In addition to the fact that SFK is an outstanding storyteller, the plot is solid, starts with a bang, has action, suspense, romance, excellent character development, and was consciously written, the author had previously done a huge background research of the places and events that lead to the 1963 JFK assassination as he explains in the afterword citing and listing most of his sources<br />11/22/63 ranks among the best ten stories I have ever read
B00BMEF6IO|1.0|This is electronic garbage with bad lyrics and fake screaming, the old stuff sounds good, I read never as can of their lyrics but  THIS is garbage
B007THA4FI|2.0|Too many characters with too many nicknames.  I am halfway through and don't know yet if there is a plot.
B000OLGCHA|4.0|I love all the Potter movies and their soundtracks.  This one, however, does not follow the scenes of the movies which is what I thought a soundtract does.  It skips about.  Umbridge before the dementors, etc.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Another trite tedious self consciously and synthetically &#34;transgressive&#34; example of the ubiquitous inescapable open-crotch pop &#34;culture&#34; which relentlessly and by degrees is suffocating Western civilisation.<br /><br />The people who created this odious thing misuse all their considerable talents and every technology available to produce yet another aliquot of corrosive poisonous pretentious drivel.<br /><br />Oh how they must chortle at the cynical production meetings. &#34;Lets see if the morons will go for a Venusian Dithyramb...&#34;  But for the young impressionable minds for whom this witches brew is destined it is no laughing matter.<br /><br />The target audience (Target being exactly the right word) will lap it up and no doubt think they are enjoying it on the way down... but then like all poisons it will slowly kill them from within.<br /><br />&#34;You're just a pig inside a human body&#34; sings the vile latter-day Siren, Gaga. Well done Ms Germanotta, perhaps a glimmering of insight at last into your own festering subconscious mind. Keep up the good work.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Slightly disappointing compared to the previous novels in the series. Seemed like they rushed to write and publish this book.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I watched this with my 6 yr. old granddaughter and it was just as much fun as watching my own children watch it.  It's just a fun movie.  They don't make this kind of movie anymore - too bad.
B008Y7IINM|4.0|A heady sci-fi that plays with a few well-worn tropes in new and amusing ways.  If you are looking for a sci-fi that isn't just lasers in space, this is for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cant stop playing it. But you learn tricks as you go along. My neice got me hooked on it.<br />It does help you get away for a little while from the world.<br />R Simmons
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Action packed. Hard to put down. This series is a lot like the Hunger Games series.  Well written, a fun read.
B009Y61ZMI|4.0|I love this movie.  A man is trained as a soldier from birth, becomes a mighty killing machine, then is replaced by other soldiers who are more powerful. He ends up on a garbage planet where stowaways are living.  Here he finds nurture for the first time in his life.  Somehow, the new soldiers find their way to the garbage planet and a battle ensues.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Great white temperature, and very bright. These are above a bathroom vanity that had 4 bulbs. I'm only using 2 of these with 2 of the incandescents. This gives a good tone with plenty of brightness.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Imagine being 73 and being humbled by a book with a noble purpose and one that should be required reading and then being discussed around a family dinner table.  This is THAT book!  Bravo!<br /><br />A must read!
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Installation was very easy and instructions were clear and easy to follow. It has been operating flawlessly for over a month now, but since I upgraded the motherboard, memory to 8G, and the GUI, all at the same time, I can't attribute the improved system performance entirely to this APU. All I can say is that it appears to be operating very well, with absolutely no issues. I will say that the  onboard Radeon HD 8670D is not all it's cracked up to be. My old GeForce GTX280 outperforms it easily, and I had serious problems trying to run FSX. Everything cleared up after installing the old 280. If using this for gaming, just count on also getting a good GUI to use rather than the Radeon HD 8670D.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Although not as shocking as Cabinet of Curiosities, I found White Fire to be more entertaining than the whole Helen series. A good read all in all.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The most complete and comprehensive set on Alien movies imaginable.<br />The Alien &#34;Anthology&#34; (a much classier word than &#34;Quadrilogy&#34;. Yuck.) is brought to blu ray with class and gusto.<br />The transfer on the first two films are demo disc quality. Alien looks as good as Blade Runner does, and that movie is in my top ten blu rays of all time. Aliens is nearly as powerful with little holding it back from being a damn good transfer in it's own right.<br />Fans of 1 & 2 won't be disappointed with this completionist set. Even if you don't care for 3 and 4, the extras native to this pack are worth it. Especially since I've seen prices for this pack drop under $40.<br />This set made me capitulate and give Alien 3 a rewatch on it's alternate cut. The Assembly Cut I believe.<br />Which is actually a blu ray exclusive in and of itself. On the DVD sets, it was a workprint cut. Not as refined, still kinda choppy.<br />It's been cleaned up and given the red carpet treatment here which is amazing, because it makes the movie better. Not only better, it justifies the movie's existence. Alien 3 is now a personal favorite.<br />The impact of this blu ray set actually changed my mind about a movie- for the better. The enlightening making of documentaries surrounding each film are also amazing, but none more so than Alien 3. The troubled production, chronicled (more or less) unbiasedly in &#34;Wreckage and Rage&#34; might be the unsung gem of this set. It offers a look inside the messed up production of the sequel to one of the most loved sci-fi movies ever. Stress and pressure for ages behind the scenes of this movie, it's bound to give you a new perspective on Alien 3 and why it could've been every bit as good as Alien and Aliens.<br />Fear not, the all-encompassing behind the scenes and making of's are just as in-depth for each movie without exception.<br />Even for the much maligned Alien Resurrection, you might be shocked at how interesting the special featuresare.<br />No movie was shortchanged in this set, and for fans it's a must own.<br />It has become a quintessential blu ray set in my collection, and one that I'm beyond proud to own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it..Awesome game..
1937053571|4.0|“Some people say when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. But when life gives you one seriously ticked off god gunning for your ass, you prepare for war and you hope for paradise.”<br /><br />Those ominous lines at the beginning of this bk pretty much sum it all up. It’s the final showdown we’ve all been waiting for between Alex, god-Apollo, Aiden and crew against the god-Ares and his group of automatons, daimons and soldiers. Seth shows his true colors and we find out where his loyalties lie. Be ready for some twists and turns.  And don’t be surprised by some sadness (hasn’t there been some in all of these bks?!?).  Unfortunately war has its casualties. But all’s not doom and gloom (ok, well most of it)…there are also bright spots.  Although it takes until nearly the end of the bk for the war to begin the earlier part of the story focuses on relationships and training. Alex and Aiden’s relationship was the best. Having the snarky Apollyon/Seth there amongst all the upheaval to rile Alex and stir Aiden’s jealousy kept things light in the midst of chaos.  Alex suffers some bumps, bruises and scars but she continued to stand strong and was a true warrior/Sentinel/Apollyon kicking ass to the very end. All the questions are answered as this was the final bk in the series and it concludes with a surprising ending (no spoilers).  Still not quite sure how I feel about it.  As this series has always had the DUN-DUN-DUN overtone I’m not quite sure what I expected but there is an HEA, just an unusual one.  Sad to see it end but in moving on I can only hope this frees up JLA’s time so she can write fast and furiously on the Lux series.  We’ll be waiting.
1401917232|2.0|People polarize around the question of whether A&P actually appear to Gary and teach him or if they are fictional characters.<br /><br />My take is they are indeed astral beings who materialize but they are not &#34;enlightened&#34;.  Just as there are many in this demension who mistakenly and sincerely believe they have achieved the highest level, many on many other levels have inflated misconceptions.<br /><br />I heard of a teacher who had his students read a book that was full of inaccuracies.  When they had all decimated it,  he said &#34;But why did none of you notice the author said something true on page 311 (or whatever page).  So yes there are glints of gold here.<br /><br />All the business about the trips to astral DisneyWorld etc. bores me and is just more of the illusion--real on its own level but not that high.  And how sad that he flushed his marriage down the toilet because of financial greed.  And how sad to be dyeing his hair etc and claiming not to have aged.<br /><br />DU was a wonderful book and helped me and many others.  The next book was weaker and this needed a rigorous editor.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Upon receiving the &#34;Superman: Man of Steel&#34; Package yesterday, it came with scratches on the DVD, and for some reason the Blue ray Disc doesn't play at all.  I am a little upset because I was waiting  to see the movie.  Is there something you all can do to correct this problem? Lucian A. Tower
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun for hours. The effects of making multiple matches is eyecatching. Its a good time killer for whenever your sitting waiting at the doctors or whenever you have time to kill.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|As a young aerospace engineer beginning a career in the industry, this book provided some great insights into how development programs have evolved over the years. The &#34;behind the scenes&#34; stories from the development of the U-2, SR-71, and F-117 are priceless. Great read for anyone in the business or just a nut about airplanes.
B0012CH350|2.0|I ordered the premium cover to replace the standard cover after it had ripped.  I have had trouble getting it to actually fit over the grill. It's nice and snug over the kettle but I can't help but get the impression that they forgot about the handle (which is welded on). I struggled to get it over the handle. I've been trying to stretch out the cover but it's been pretty difficult.  I was very surprised since the standard cover fit so well.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Fascinating trilogy! Gripping and couldn't put it down!  Margaret Atwood is a master of speculative fiction.  I wish there was more coming.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is lots of fun! Just the game to play when you want to unwind. Plus the minions are just too cute.
B0039NJTLQ|2.0|Blah story line. It took forever to get started. I feel like they were setting it up...setting it up...setting it up, all for 5 minutes of action and drama at the end. Being from a military town I figured I would enjoy this more...nope.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of it. I took it with me to a party, and everyone was delighted with Katy's voice and rhythmic interpretations. Our feet were never quiet. Her beat is so contagious that we could not stop dancing. There are songs in this album that soon will be international hits. In a few words I could say that Katy delivered big time again.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford & Sons have a great sound, great lyrics, and a style and language that is so much more pleasant than all that pop crap put out today.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|&#34;HD not available because display does not meet HDCP requirements&#34;. . . my display does meet HDCP requirements so not sure why this doesn't work. Another example of how difficult it is to watch legal content online, it is much easier for me to watch this film in hd through illegitimate channels, pathetic.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Good Evening New York City CD & DVD is True Entertainment. This is something everyone can enjoy.  Paul McCartney can still rock the house down,
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and now my toddler loves it too. Anyone that has a problem with this movie should settle down and lighten up.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This was a free app of the day a couple of weeks ago. It has been very entertaining. I would highly recommend it.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Reading Grain Brain offerd a perspective on my family history and relationship to grain. My mother intuitively and symptomatically knew her gastrointestinal issues were associated with the consumption of grain. Tests for an allergy were negative and so 50 years ago she went with undiagnosed issues with her digestion. She was diagnosed with diabetes in her 60's and for the last seven years of her life journey through the maze of dementia transitioning at the age of 89.<br /><br />Grain Brain woke me to the options I have within my control and my health destiny as I head towards a supported aging experience that eluded my mother. Given I was my mother's caregiver for many years I have first hand experienced what could befall my years ahead. I am in gratitude for the information and real changes offered in Grain Brain that I can create for myself. Since removing gluten I have improved my undiagnosed digestion problems. An understanding of insulin resistance has me vigilant to the numbers my blood tests reveal. They are normal in the high range. I now have talking points with my family doctor. I gave her Grain Brain to read. Thank you Dr. Perlmutter. My present life is improved and I look forward to my aging life.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|The reason u should get this is because it has very cute little creatures and little pets. I do not recommend kids under 6 play it tho is to hard.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|the gang was assembled once again,but it was hard to achieve the hilarious shock effect the the first two installments provided.
B0014QABX0|5.0|Bought this CD after hearing only one of their songs.  Had never heard of them before.  It's a pretty good CD.  Definitely a good buy for me.  Wasn't disappointed at all.  Liked it enough that I plan on buying more from them in the future.
0618680004|5.0|Absolutely love this book!  For an atheist surrounded by holy rollers, this book helps reassure that you are not alone.  Though your worldview may seem a minority among the rest, skeptical, critical thinking for yourself is not only not as rare as you think, but it is an approach to life worth sharing with others.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|Fantastic concert!  While I love all their hits (that's all I knew), I thoroughly enjoyed the concert.  Audio is 1st class - I used DTS 5.1 surround.  Dolby 5.1 is also available.  Video is good - no need to fuss about 1979 not being as good as today.  With good video and outstanding audio, this is a great concert.  These guys are very skilled and diverse in talents.  This is a must have!  If you only know a few songs, you'll still find this worth while.
0062225790|5.0|I absolutely love getting a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; view of Dawkins' life and experiences. The only downside is that this book is not long enough.  I found myself trying to read slower and slower toward the end so I could enjoy it longer.  His writing flows so naturally, I could read his books everyday.
B00005214X|5.0|I forgot just how good this guy is, this particular Beatle.  He's just different than John and Paul.  Lots of memories from the early 70's with most of these songs.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is challenging & fun. However, I don't agree that it doesn't have any bugs..been stuck on Level 8 forever, it freezes up in the middle of a good scoring game. The really annoying thing is that it doesn't keep accurate count of your &#34;gems&#34; at all..uses them up way too quickly & says you used more than you really did:+(
B000000OMJ|5.0|Loved Genesis, and when they split I had to go with Peter.  Love Peter Gabriel, not Phil Collins.  If you're a fan, get this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is delightful, be careful it can be quite addictive. Only dislike is that u need to pay if u want to keep on until u win. I just end the game and start over, so it's still 5 stars for me
B0060QM09M|5.0|All these books and this author are absolutely first rate.  I WONDERFUL writer and if you love animals, then read them all.
B00000J7M0|4.0|Like virtually all reviewers here, I concur that Staying a Life is one of the best live metal albums ever made. The live versions of &#34;Breaker&#34;and &#34;Son of a B....&#34; will tear your head off! I purchased this album when it first came out (in the late 80's if memory serves me well) and it's production holds up well even here in the 21st century.<br /><br />The only reason that I give it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating is because of a slight mess-up by one of the guitarists in &#34;Balls to the Wall.&#34; Not sure if it's Hoffman or Fischer but it somewhat diminishes the quality of this great tune. One could easily praise this as evidence that the mix was virtually untouched in the studio and this minor blemish in the performance simply adds to the &#34;live aura&#34; of the recording.<br /><br />All in all, a GREAT live album! Highly recommended.
B00B32X786|3.0|It was okay.  I probably would not watch it again. It floated along the surface; but didn't reach me on any meaningful level.  Perhaps if you are a psychology student, you may enjoy analyzing why each character is behaving the way they do and what their final agenda is.  No real excitement, no real action, no highly emotional moments, no real plot and no real solution to anyone's problems.  Ultimately, you are to surmise that all girls are beautiful.  It received 3 stars, because it does have some merit, the actors are brilliant especially with the material they were given.  Rosie is playing Rosie, as usual.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this book---actually the whole trilogy.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that Tris died!  I like the way the author tied everything up after her death, but wished that she had survived to move forward with her life with Tobias.
0525951652|5.0|Just love this type of book and Ken Follett keeps the story moving and exciting.  Have read the trilogy and recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, knights and ladies.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Fantastic in the true sense of the word. George RR Martin transports the reader into a realm of incredible detail and constantly twisting plots, charactered by people, magical beasts and situations that are beyond compare. Riveting, absorbing and transporting, and eloquently written, with humour, sweepingly brilliant landscapes and a veritable pendulum of protagonists that swings from insane evil to naive delusion. Can one ask for more in a book?! Other than to beg for Book 6 :-)
1400069289|5.0|One of the most influential books I have read in a decade.  My teenage sons (3) read it too which says a lot.  It held their interested.  Very fascinating information told in a very interesting way.  It held the interest of 3 teenagers, and these teenagers are not bookworm kids, they are all jocks!
B00G32VYDG|1.0|Not enough Marissa Miller.  Nope.  Not even close.  A shame really, cause the movie is also not funny.  Not even for a dollar.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down. I read this book in one day. This is an instant classic one of those that will be read in school. I could smell the food as I read it, you are transported to this time and know the characters well without the story dragging on. I am shocked that this is the authors first novel, I will happily read any other novels she writes.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Action follows the book but without any of the plot or character defvelopment. Okay for kids, but not very satisfying if you read the book.
B00E5I2M9K|5.0|Loved the movie! Thor is great. Had already seen the Avengers so was nice to finally get to see the story of Thor and his brother Loki. Can't wait to see the sequel.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I just love this movie! It is such a memory for me. I made my kids watch it every year with me while they were growing up!
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Amazing!  One of the best shows on TV!  I bought this along with season two for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas.  We watch it on TV every Sunday night together.  It has all of the fairy tale characters she loves and story lines that I like too.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Not even worth a lengthy review, DO NOT WATCH THIS!!! Save yourself the time and watch something else, or don't listen to the reviews, and end up writing one yourself..
B00EO3PKHM|5.0|I love this show.  I purchased it for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas.  We watch it together every Sunday night.  It is full of the fairy tale characters that she loves, but has a story line that I love.  There is some mild violence but nothing too scary.  And she is the kind of kid that gets scared at almost everything.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is extremely Entertaining!!!!!  I played  it on my pc and was happy to<br />Find it available on my kindle fire.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Too many characters and histories that made the book boring and heavy to read. Pendergast is so many plain that not deserve the word hero. My first and last book for these authors.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is a fun game and enjoyable over and over again.<br />I love to play it on a regular basis.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally making this app available on the Kindle!  Now I don't have to carry another Device to play it on.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I wanted to give it 5 stars, but that rating is sacred, so this is the highest rating I can give a normal book! I enjoyed it immensely.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Quick and easy, best of all big display and free!! I highly recommend, I have mine on my kindle, always handy when I need it.
1451666179|5.0|Fantastic work!  Her description of depression is spot on--told with humor and poignancy.  I love this book, it's so damn funny!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app! Totally addictive and challenging. There are plenty of levels and each one is different. I just hate having to wait for my friends to help me get to the next stage.
B006LSZECO|3.0|the book kept my attention for most of the hours of my breaks, but when you reach the ending, you feel really disappointed.
1592537251|5.0|Wonderful book! This book  is excellent for beginners viewer  professional sketchings ! The product has outstanding to diversity  between illustrators sketchings !
B0018QQQK8|5.0|You should defiantly read this book! It is different from the movie in so many ways. I like it WAY better!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This app is great! I love that you can play other people and unlock other pool tables. Definitely a time killer, I have a table in my parents basement but I like this for when I want to play and not play myself !
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is an awesome game I love it . It`s similar to temple run which I like temple run . But subway surfer  to me is way funner than temple run and and every one of my siblings love it . And it`s a very addicting game and I just love it .
1400049628|3.0|Funny and well written but I just wanted more of it. last 100 pages just existed of stories of zombies in history
B0007MWZEK|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!! I was so excited to get the Swivel Sweeper.  It sounded like and end to my frustrations trying to keep my floors clean.  Easy assembly.  I charged the battery according to directions, and was very anxious  to put this sweeper to the test.<br />About 25 minutes after I started cleaning my floors, it just stopped working.  I thought maybe hair caused the problem, so I used that tool to get all the hair out of the brushes.  No luck.  Then I thought that maybe the battery died even though it is supposed to last 45 minutes.  I plugged the battery in, waited 12 hours, and No Luck!  I can not get this sweeper to work.  The only truth about this sweeper is that it assembles easily and is light weight.  VERY disappointed, and back to searching for a new vacuum for my hardwood floors.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use math a lot and this is the best for a basic calculator.  I also like that it shows the whole problem.  I recommend this app to anyone.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Everybody needs to play this game. Ive been playing it for a while now... and i absolutely love playing it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|An absolute classic...  If you haven't read it, I strongly suggest that you do...  Forget Hollywood and the slapstick Silver, reading the original really puts everything into its intended focus.<br />One thing that I always think is how nobody in this story can be described as being truly blameless or completely acting to the letter of the law - this includes our hero Jim Hawkins and his 'business associates'.<br />Stephenson was an extremely talented writer who didn't necessarily write to be in vogue - a proper iconoclast for his generation!<br />ENJOY!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|For a law-and-order aficionado who works peripherally with the legal system, Dexter is such a refreshing fantasy - evil people who game the legal avenues of justice still get taken down; the good guys mostly win. In between, there's plenty of character development and angst to keep each dire situation different enough not to feel cookie-cutter. It seems more real to have a hero/anti-hero who may be cleaning up the bad people, but not in a way all the good people would condone - conflicted emotions create interesting theater. Most of us wouldn't have it in us to actually hunt down evil and kill it, so in a fantasy world where (thus far) Dexter doesn't face the ultimate consequences, we can cheer him on as a surrogate to the dark feelings inside that we don't like to admit to.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I'm just happy that I'm the first to leave a comment for this game so far from what I've seen it seems like a very good game it looks great the graphics is flawless only thing I don't like about it is that it's free so u know that you'll have to spend a lot of money to proceed
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Thor the dark world game rocks. Not just movie content but comics as well. Which makes it extremely fun!! Play away and bring on Loki!!!!!#
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Terrible.  The only thing that makes this part of the &#34;Hangover&#34; movies is the title and the cast members.  This is NOT a comedy, it's a horrible stumbling try at a crime drama for some reason.  It's not even humorous!  Loved the first two - they were funny.  I guess the producers decided they didn't want to stick to the winning formula and wanted to make a &#34;grownup&#34; movie.  Well, you failed.  It's not comedy, it's not drama, I have no idea what they were trying to do!
B00F031X62|3.0|Many of us want as much of Hendrix as we can get. I first heard his music shortly after his death in 1970. Since that time a vast offering of Hendrix material has been released--some remarkably good, some quite bad, some so-so. This concert seems particularly uninspired on every cut. None of them are offered with the passion and precision of some other renditions.  &#34;Tax Free&#34; has some tricky changes and just flops, sadly.  Jimi is badly out of tune on several numbers, and one tires of hearing all the tuning between songs. Could this not been edited out?<br /><br />Yes, it is still Jimi, and no one has ever played like him, before, during, or after this short life. That gives some joy, of course.<br /><br />The sound quality is clear, and Mitch Mitchell's outstanding drumming can be heart in its full glory. This is not always the case in live recordings of The Experience.<br /><br />Thus, we have another exhibit in the museum of Jimi Hendrix and his band. But unless someone is incurably curious or a completist, I do not recommend this album.
1451666179|5.0|I got this on a whim, browsing for some new books to put on my iPad mini for trips.  I had never heard of Allie Brosh or her blog, but I LOVED THE BOOK!  ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!  I've now read through her entire blog.  I finished her book in 2 days.  I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is seriously an easy read and a quick read. The writing was not too bad. The author made a great plot, however, I can't help feel that this is too similar to The Fifty Shades series. I do like the twist on the female being f***ed up versus the grey male.<br /><br />I feel like the sex is simple and the author wasn't afraid to use the correct terminology. I am interested in wanting g to know about Cross' past. Why is he so crAzy when he sleeps ? What's going on with Cary too? Why is he being s whacko. Ready for the second book!
0521675804|4.0|Very happy with this book but was surprised to find that the units don't always reference the area of speech being covered which would have been really helpful.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved the series, all books including this one were entertaining and intelligently written. The characters were well developed though sometimes predictable after first couple of books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty good depth, interesting levels. Looking forward to playing more levels as they become available. First game I have played like this.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|This is one the finest series I have ever seen on television.  Wonderfully written, marvelously acted and beautifully filmed.  A good film to see today as our social codes and mores vanish  in the trash that currently comes out of Hollywood, television and radio.  Make the effort and you will not be sorry for the time spent with the characters and their stories.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Classic! One of the great films in the history of cinema. Deserves to be in every collection. Very moving film.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Doesn't everyone love this movie?  We bought this to replace our original, worn out DVD. Great family film. Good deal too.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Been a fan since &#34;Soldiers&#34;.  No More Hell to Pay has been playing in my office and in my truck almost non-stop since I downloaded it.  Great sound and lyrically is one of their best.  Stryper is back to their roots both musically and spiritually.  Love it!!!  &#34;Revelation&#34;, title track, and &#34;Marching into Battle&#34; are early favorites but the project in it's entirety is great!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it is the best game ever i mean littarly at the beggining u stinkin fight the best robot in the game it is so fun get it OR DIE!!!!!!!!!
B008JFUNJQ|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the entire Ender's Game book series. However, if you loved the books, you will hate the movie. There was some good special effects, but nothing that was so mind blowing it changed everything for me. In fact, I went into the movie knowing that they would have to change some things in order to squeeze it into the time allocated, but nothing could have really prepared me for what I saw. It was like watching a movie based on Cliffs Notes of the book if you had removed major sections. Thinking back, I really feel like I was watching it in fast forward.<br /><br />If you read Ender's Game you will likely find yourself confused and hurt by all they left out from the book. Battle School took place over a couple of months (this might be a generous evaluation), there are just a couple of school battles, Bonzo Madrid is almost half Ender's size, oh, and they completely leave out what Peter and Valentine are doing on Earth. [I have only put in a few of the highlights that wouldn't be interpreted as spoilers.]<br /><br />On the other hand, if you never read the book, you might not understand it. Many people left the theater asking, &#34;Wait, so who was Valentine?&#34;<br /><br />I love Sci-Fi movies, even the really bad ones that my wife laughs at me for wasting my time on. However, in this case it is like someone trying to replicate the Mona Lisa on a dinner plate out of Spaghettios and saying it's as good as the original. This is one movie I will not be adding to my collection. My only hope is that in a couple of decades someone will buy the rights and make it as 2 or 3 movies as it should have been done.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I like puzzles and mysteries and seek &amp; find. This game combines all three! I finished the game in about 2 hours, so I can say it was more fun than frustration. I have always liked the G5 games and on a night when I wasn't able to sleep it was a great past time.
1423151054|3.0|When people say you'll be disappointed you will be disappointed, but not if you know what you're getting. You get nine hard cover books of a character one of the nine old men were famous for animating. The book flips through one single action of that character(s). Some of the movements they chose do not look great when flipped through. Others are very good and interesting. There are about 150 pages to flip through with each book so you get some pretty good movement. Then there is a small 43 page paperback book that gives you a short history of each animator and the animation process.<br />The whole product is nicely packaged. It is very interesting, but a more in-depth book about the nine old men or Disney animation will give you a lot more. This is more of a novelty gift that you place on a coffee table or the shelf for your guest to flip through. It gets boring very quickly. The price point is a little much for what you're getting.<br />If you know what's in this collection and that seems interesting to you then you will love seeing the flip books. I like the flip books, but I wish there was more about the nine old men, more about the studio that created these movies and I wish that it had more than just one action to flip through. For me it was just okay.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|I think i just expected too much from this film after the last two, but i have to say i dont think i laughed at all until a scene that occurred after the credits.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works well but not used very often. I worry that battery may die during the nite if i<br />am not careful to check charge.<br /><br />.
B0033WDCRA|5.0|Awesome groove throughout the entire record.  Makes you wanna jump up and dance.  I wish I had bought it for myself.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked it but not an awesome book  I have to write words I have to write words I have to write words
B0041H18MM|5.0|Beautiful, calming, absolutely enchanting music!  I love playing it on riany days, I think Speigel is my favorite track, and it's so much music for your money.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I thought I would get a VHS for the price I paid and I was pleasantly surprised to see a DVD.  Thanks.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|It could have been so much better - the story idea is really interesting.  The acting was pretty bad, and the &#34;scary&#34; kids looked like they were dressed up for Halloween with bad make-up jobs.  And each scene was soooo dark!  Why didn't they turn on any lights in the house?
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|This series is very gripping and exciting. You actually care about the characters and want to see what will happen to them next. Although I may be biased as they are my ancient ancestors.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think this is an awesome game. you get your own pets and things!!! its a little like the My Little Pony one
B00082IJ08|4.0|Album Review:<br />Album: Demon Days  Artist: Gorlliaz  Released: May 25, 2005<br /><br />Lyrics: The lyrics to this album are not necessarily award worthy but they are still fun and imaginative and even sometimes sad. They tend to be a little repetitive especially Last Living Souls, Kids with Guns, and Feel Good Inc. however, this doesn’t make the songs bad just at some points you wished they say something else  3/5<br /><br />What the songs are emotionally about: What the songs are emotionally about vary greatly like it is strange because on Feel Good Inc. the lead single makes you feel somewhat happy but the lyrics are dark and sad, so I get a mixed feeling about the emotionally feeling but overall it is a happy feeling I get from them at least. 4/5<br /><br />Rhythm/Beat: Now this is where the album shines the beats, groves, and the rhythm to this album are make this album worth the listen. It makes you just want to dance sorta like Daft Punk but obviously less techno you get my drift. 5/5<br /><br />Vocals: The non-rap vocals are great and they add a very dramatic feel to most songs. However, the rap is a little annoying at sometimes but not too much they are mostly fun and silly which makes them great, and easy to ignore and listen if you desire to do both 3.5/5<br /><br />I would recommend this if you like? Different music with great beats, weird vocals and rapping with a weird storytelling song as well it giving a very nostalgic feeling<br /><br />Top Four Songs:<br />1. Demon Days<br />2. Feel Good Inc.<br />3. All Alone<br />4. Don’t Get Lost In Heaven<br /><br />Overall Rating: 3.5/5
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a great sequel to an equally great book.  I felt that &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; was Grisham's best book  This is just as good.  It was so exciting I could not stand it so I read the ending and then went back and read the rest.  I have read almost all of Grisham's books
0756666937|4.0|My 7 year got this about two weeks ago and is still lugging it around everywhere he goes. He even keeps it under his pillow at night.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was born two years after this books publishing. The greatest writers are able to produce a story that will endure the test of time. Elements if this book are current despite being more than two decades old. That is no easily surmountable feat.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|I learned about this book through Goodreads. I found it absorbing, although it lost the plot a little in the middle. I had to keep reading, even though the principal character became quite unlike able.
1119962846|5.0|I bought this book as supplemental reading for a class where we used both SAS and R. Unfortunately SAS is expensive to buy as an individual and R is completely free. Not a programmer? This book is your friend in understanding and mastering R.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Keeps me from doing my housework. I'm glad when I run out of lives so I get off my butt! It totally keeps my attention. Thank you.<br />Asking for 20 word minimum is crap though!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is very addictive. Trying to beat somebody's top score and I keep getting close yet no cigar. Very fun game.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of the best series of all times! Each episode keeps you guessing and excited. Great actors and definitely worth the buy
B009JCPM5S|2.0|I do like Stephen King films. Glad I saw this, but it's old and not that impressive compared to todays films.  Not something I would watch again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it a lot,  but what I like most is that it virtual,  money,  stink. I bet though. that having a real horse must be better. For those that don't have the money spacee or time this,  this is a good replacement.
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|Different but you can still hear the original sound from trivium in some of the songs and the new sound is not that bad
B00E8G5HDW|4.0|Another fantastic season comes to an end. And with it, an abrupt ending to the series, cut short by the \\"Wonderful World of Disney\\" who have decided to \\"go in a different direction\\". I guess that means putting an end to anything they didn't have total control over from the beginning. A shame, since this show was the best thing the Star Wars fans have seen on screen in decades. The least they could do is one last feature length episode resolving the unfinished storyline between Darth Maul and his former Master. We may never know how it really ends. For this, I have to take away one star from what was otherwise a 5 star season.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I seldom play games on my phone or Kindle tablet. I have downloaded maybe a dozen over the years, kept three which I play occasionally when I have nothing to read. They are Temple Run, Fruit Ninja, and Dumb Ways to Die. Great fun ways to kill ten minutes.  The theme song on this game is catchy. &#34;Dumb ways to die, dumb ways to die ie ie&#34;  Challenges are doable, with the exception of the fork in the toaster. For a game that shows little jelly beans dying it is surprisingly happy. LIke having the bear drop candy on your head.
B004IWF64Q|5.0|Pocahontas had not just 1 man but 2 men that is beautiful on the inside and out loving on her. What a lucky girl!!!!
B008J05EL8|1.0|Thanks Amazon for taking my money and giving me nothing regarding this office suite app for my Kindle. First time I am disgusted with Amazon as app won't open. Nice going Amazon!!! DO NOT WASTER YOUR TIME BUYING THIS APP!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this 'sequel' to The Shining. I couldn't put down the book as I entered the last several chapters. I'd rather not get into details or some of the strengths and weaknesses I personally felt about the story, but would like to suggest Mr. King has indeed evolved with his writing skills and tale telling expertise. I will comment that the ending seemed a bit too 'pat', even tho I was rooting for Dan and Abra, so I can't complain too much. I have re-read The Shining several months ago and still can't help but consider that as his 'best'! I found the individual names of the True Knot 'family' a bit silly and interrupted the flow for me, but that is minor. Overall a great read and highly recommend! Keep on keeping on, Stephen King!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun...not too difficult but not overly simple either.  I'd like more levels since I finished the game in less than a half hour.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|im listening to al,s version of the beatles songs as we speak. I dont have fancy words, its just great. Sounds great, in your head it sends you to another place. I,ve been a fan since the beginning, and he has never dissappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The tension in the book was always there with every page that you read. A lot of casualties throughout the book. So don't read this if your super super sensitive. But if your looking for an adventure mixed with romance, you've got it. I count wait for the movie to come out this November!
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I think this series is one of the best ones that I have read.  Now I'm ready for the next crossfire novel to come out.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the Netflix version. Events are much like the Netflix TV series without the TV drama. The book an easy read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great writing. Fun to read and full or twists and turns. Can&#34;t wait for the next installment. Susan has it a nerve about what is happening in America. Better than atlas shrugged, a much easier read
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Following the release of her second proper album [[ASIN:B004K4AVAG Born This Way]] began the period some called \\"Gagamania\\". In all honesty it was probably the largest musical publicity campaign of my lifetime thus far. The name Lady Gaga itself became a buzz word,even outside a musical context. And the last time I actually heard of that happening was with the Beatles during my father's youth. Now I was more than aware that Lady Gaga had genuine musical talent. On the other hand it was hard to escape from getting the singer confused with the song. And when I heard that last album in 2011? Well it did have its strong moments,but the publicity for it was so overwhelming the album really didn't have a chance to creatively live up to the intense ubiquity of the artist who created it. Then she went on an enormous tour for it,being she's one of the few contemporary artists possessed of enough cabaret/music hall-type theatrics to be a completely effected on stage performer on her own terms. It was announced she wouldn't be putting out a new album for awhile. During that time Gagamania as it were cooled...as the sometimes embarrassing non musical antics of teen stars Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus have grabbed the spotlight. In the meantime Lady Gaga delivered a third full album that,from what I have heard of her,very strongly delivers on the strong musical talent that embodied how she was first presented to me before I even heard her music.<br /><br />  Beginning with the intro of gypsy/folk guitar \\"Aura\\" opens the album which extends on that gypsy folk type melody with very rhythmically sturdy uptempo dubstep type mixed in as well. \\"Venus\\",the percussive \\"G.U.Y\\" and \\"Sexx Dreams are even more impressive as they slow the tempo down a bit for a more groove based 80's synth pop/new wave sound with the electronic keyboards playing more of a melodic than textural role. At first \\"Jewels 'N Drugs\\" comes off as so cliched,instrumentally trashy and obnoxious with the silly raps of T.I.,Too $hort and Twisa that I saw it as a clunker-until I remembered how much wicked musical humor Gaga had with (what I can only assume) is a musical joke on her behalf. \\"Manicure\\" takes more of a new wave rock approach with a put of a punky cheerleader/Toni Basil attitude. \\"Do What U Want\\" with R.Kelly is one of my favorites here and what bought me to this album. It has a burbling,echoing base of boogie funk bass synthesizers with Gaga and Kelly with some powerful vocal exchanges. The title song is another pulsing,often stripped down melodic electronica type dance number with an almost droning pulse. \\"Swine\\",\\"Donetella\\" and \\"Mary Jane Holland\\" are very dramatically structured EDM type numbers-helped along by strong honest to goodness melodic versus with electric guitar and bass lines. \\"Fashion!\\" is a fantastically realized live band lean 70's disco era dance/funk number while \\"Dope\\" focuses in on Gaga's piano-spiced only with very light electronics and a slightly off kilter vocal delivery reflecting the decadent atmosphere she's projecting. \\"Gypsy\\" is a beautifully melodic ballad while \\"Applause\\" ends the album on another rather stripped down electronica type uptempo dance number.<br /><br />  One of the things I like most about this album is how Lady Gaga has come to realize that the music of the 1980's embodied more than an instrumental style. That 80's era ethic of melodic synthesizers and slower,groove oriented rhythms is hugely prominent on this album. Lady Gaga is a dance music artist. So the majority of the music here is uptempo of course. Which I don't mind whatsoever being primarily a funk admirer,of course. Yet another quality that really brings this album out is not only a sense of diversity-from leaner 80's uptempo synth pop/electronica to out and out disco and boogie/post disco funk, but an overall happier,more celebratory mood than I heard on her previous album.  Her persona as a somewhat jaded and over sexed dance music femme fatale seems to be what's primarily on display at the beginning of this album. Towards the end she is seeing herself mainly as someone desirous of attention from others. And sometimes doesn't seem so sure that she's altogether proud of that either. There will of course be some who are so totally put out by the Gagamania surrounding her previous album in 2011 that this album will earn instant condemnation from them.But the glue that holds the whole album together though is Gaga's firm grip on her core musical talent. Much as with Pet Shop Boys two and a half decades ago,Lady Gaga's songs present themselves with such a strong degree of song craft that if one took all the instrumentation away,you'd have excellent and enduring songs still left behind. Add to that of course her patented Prince/Madonna type way of courting hyper sexual controversy and you've got an album that is more physically revolutionary and futurist than trashy \\"sexploitation\\". Unsure if this will perform commercially as Gaga's more overt music may have done. But it shows her,at the very least,going forward in a very good musical direction.at's primarily on display at the beginning of this album.

B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I really like the game, but it keeps crashing on my Kindle Fire.  Wish I could play it all the way through...
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I love these types of puzzles - nonograms (which this developer has one called FlipPix - got it when it was a FAOTD) , Slitherlink, etc.  BTW, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, but I'd never played, or even heard of, this type of puzzle and I had no issue with understanding the tutorial and what to do.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am used to read books like the hanger games. when I saw this book I recognized it from the movie. After awhile I bought it and couldn't stop reading it.<br />This is one of the best books I ever red!<br />I just loved everything about it- the main character is so honest. He dis scribes His feelings in a way so special, like how he feels in those quite happy moments. Or when he just listen from the far, and observes people`s behavior.<br />All I can say that you mast read this book no matter what!!
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|This book, so anxiously awaited by me,was disappointing. Although I knew it would all come together in the end, I lost patience with the convoluted storyline. My favorite character is Pendergast and his presence was sorely lacking in this book. I almost put the book dome without finishing it since I pretty much knew how it would end.
B0040I09RM|5.0|my husband and I don't watch many things together except sons. Started watching season 1 and still am to this day. Now that its on amazon I can watch them all over again.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Excellent follow-up to The Shining.  Reveals another understanding of alcoholism that goes beyond the normal conceptions.<br /><br />I am selling my Winniebago and killing the cat......but not today.
142332241X|5.0|superb story-telling--typical of all of amy tan's books!  i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a really good and well thought out tale.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Almost a 5 star rating. However, not as good as prior 007 movies. It was thrilling from the beginnig to end.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Story line was easy to follow, moved well with relationships and action, characters all believable and likeable. Good special effects and didn't add sex and bad language for whatever reason others do.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This set is outstanding. The quality of the tapes are excellent. The programs are clear and look brand new. Perhaps it is because the DVDs were produced by Universal Studios. If you enjoyed watching Columbo on TV these DVDs will also be enjoyed by you.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|5 of 5, 10 of 10! An amazing read that will keep you turning pages. This is the second time I read this novel, and it was like I remembered it. Fantastic.<br /><br />Dear God make a sequel Mr. Cline.
B001QB5SFO|3.0|I ordered this as a joke and the following story is true:  I sent it to my friend at his (federal) office building.  The package had no indication that it was drop shipped as an Amazon order and had an address he did not recognize.  Inside was  a note saying &quot;Thank You&quot; and some gritty white powder, along with the dvd.  My friend and the building security guy were quarantined for 4 hours.  The entire building was shut down. Six haz-mat vehicles, Bomb Squad, 7 cop cars, a ladder truck from the fire department, FBI, FPS, and 2 news helicopters, were dispatched.  An immediate investigation into the owner of the residence on the return address ensued. Turns out he was a Saudi Arabian National but was renting the house to someone else.  Not kidding, all of this happened.  Best estimates are that this cost about $500k which surely could have been avoided if my order had been labeled as an Amazon order.  Of course I had no sympathy for my poor friend and when he relayed the story (after he was released from quarantine...boy was he mad) all I could do was laugh and try not to pee my pants.  Two days later the video was returned by the FBI who had perused it for anything bad since the dvd was not in its original celephane even though it was sold as new.  I hope the FBI enjoyed the movie.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Great eye candy. The plot was more in depth than I thought it would be (thank goodness). There was a bit of cheese towards the end, but not bad.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this game is relaxing and competitive at the same time.  love it!  the different power ups are fun and you get to share with friends and compete with friends.

0307352153|5.0|As a life long introvert-in-denial the ideas presented in this book are groundbreaking.  A book I will hold near and dear to my heart for a long time.<br />I have long subjugated my introverted preferences to what I took to be societies greater wisdom, that extroverts are both better and happier.  Until now, I was unable to clearly define this inward struggle for myself, a struggle between my innate nature and this extroverted, loud, obnoxious society I live in.  I don't have to tell you introverts what an exasperating and exhausting struggle that is!  In this book, Susan Cain shines a bright light on the world of introverts, but this time it's much appreciated.  Well done!
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|These short stories are very intriguing and amazing. All the main characters are well developed. Forms of Love and Life in Prison are full of action and suspense and surprisingly plausible. I enjoyed especially Clouded Emotions and also being scared at the same time, knowing how much we are all connected to the internet. Mr Rossi is an amazing storyteller!

B002ZG98C8|5.0|For something that started out as a joke, Machete took on a life of its' own.  The story, actors and effects are first rate. There is a lot of sex, violence and &#34;adult&#34; language.  This is not a kid movie!  It is a first rate action movie with several big name stars.
B00BATG18K|2.0|I have enjoyed all of the author's previous books. But this book did not keep my interest .  I found myself rushing through paragraphs to see if there was a more interesting part. Too much sex not enough description about the people and the main story line.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best short run TV series ever made.  Several of the actors have gone to bigger and better roles and still appear in TV series today.  The writting was first rate.  A must have for true Scifi fans

B002WY65VU|4.0|This is a standard Zombie slasher movie with a great cast, snappy story and enough action to keep almost anyone interested.  Woody Harilson is great.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You really can't go wrong with this app.  If you need a basic desktop calculator (I use this when I work with my checkbook) this will do.  I've found that on my Kindle Fire HD it's just the right size for &quot;eyes-off&quot; use.  Thanks!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|pretty much same as before.<br />Pretty AWESOME!!!!!  anybody over 5.  I am speechless.  House of Hades, here I come!!!  :)

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from this band.  Heard an excerpt from them on Public Radio.  Makes great background music since you really can't understand any of the word-sounds.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Game is fun to play. Wish I did not need to be online to be able to play. That is th  only thing I have a problem with. There are times I can't be in a wifi area.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It does what I need it to do wonderfully! I would suggest this app to anyone! I use it constantly.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|Yep! this game is hard and makes you think logically. I like it however as there is good tutorial that gets you started. The presentation is good. It is a nice balance of 'puzzle' and 'logic'. I tested this with my app scanner and no modules were found that are seen to be suspicious. No unwanted permissions or excessive permission issues, No data mining analytics. I wish the price was balanced too to make this even more sweet purchase.<br /><br />Overall a nice logic based puzzle game that makes you think hard and like the fact you can resume where you left even after exiting the game.

B00BEF1AEK|2.0|The game is appropriately named. It is 'King' of oddball. Game-play is simple enough to keep you engaged if you do not mind tapping and trying your luck. You have three shots with the weird looking monkey king swinging his tongue with oddly shaped rock. You destroy tanks, or TNT bombs, this or that and as long as those objects are cleared you clear the level and move on. I have not really attempted to finish all levels as somewhere it got boring as there is a lot of lucky tapping involved and I personally did not like the weird looking character swinging it's tongue.<br /><br />Also, I wish the game had some ways to exit properly. I fear games that do not have exit button and forces you to hit the home button and keeps running in the background. Adding to this worry there is 'Flurry Analytics' which seems pretty normal these days with most games. The 'data' that is collected is Anonymous but still 'data' if you ask me that could be mined out of your device. If you do not mind these noted issues then it is probably just a mere time waster nothing spectacular in my opinion.
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|The graphics looks nice. Special moves are exciting. But the fights get repetitive quickly; the control for all robots are the same.  I would suggest the developer give each robot different moves.  The in-game purchase are quite expensive.  If you like it enough to buy a second robot.  I would suggest purchasing the Reward-Doubler for $10.  Otherwise the game progression would be tediously slow.  The game takes every chance to prompt you for in-game purchase (almost every fight).  It can't be turned off.<br /><br />The game rely heavily on your Facebook friends to get perks and additional rewards.  They also have to install the game (large file size) to make it work.  You can also link it to your Amazon gamecircle for listing on the leader board, there are only about a dozen players who have done this.<br /><br />If you don't want to struggle on the above topics, I would suggest you do not play this game at all.  I have 150+ apps all free.  This is the first game I am suckered into paying real money.  I hope they continuously improve the game and have new robots, otherwise it's getting old fast.  There are also a few bugs with the game that needs to be fixed.<br /><br />2 weeks later: The game is so boring, I regret every penny I spent on it.  It also skipped a few rewards I am supposed to get for achievements.  Help desk is unresponsive.

0739366408|4.0|I've committed the ultimate reader sin- I watched the movie before I read the book it was based on. Based is used loosely in my opinion. This book was engaging and just real enough to scare the living crap out of me. If zombies swarmed, this book would be fact and not fiction. I synopsis revolves around the oral histories supplied by survives around the world who are interviewed by the author. From American to Antarctica, the history of the world destruction slowly unravels. The book touches on human greed, determination, and our ultimate need to survive whatever is thrown at us. The different viewpoints provided by the interviewees introduce the reader to the various responses of each country and culture's response to the undead take over. I was lucky enough for to listen to the audiobook version. It was glorious and made the creepy, holy crap is this real?! factor, so much closer to home than if I had been creating the voices in my head. Each character has an authentic accent and it's so REAL. I highly recommend the audio version. It's like listening to the oral history of world war survivors and reliving the scene through the painful chords of their personal voice.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh makes all of us feel less weird. Her self-effacing humor is adorable and  her drawings so loveable and expressive! I especially love her stories about being a terrible kid, her broken dogs, and anything where her mom shows up with crossed arms, looking bewildered. This is a quick read, but something you can read more than once and still get a case of the giggles! I love Hyperbole and a Half!

B00E7SFAAG|4.0|It had my attention for a day or two, and occasionally I'll return when I really have nothing better to do, like watch paint dry. But, all in all it's not that bad, just get's repetitive quickly.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|This version contains the original Eurythmics soundtrack which really is worth buying separately if you like the band. But I digress. Really good casting in this version adds to the enjoyment (if you can call it that) of this frightening and deeply thought-provoking story. The moment of Winston and Julia's downfall (&#34;We are the dead..&#34;) remains one of the most chilling moments I've ever seen on film. The story moves quickly and those who have read the novel will more easily follow the narrative; however those who have not read the book can still enjoy this movie. Recommended! The US version is currently out of print and from what I've read, was inferior in omitting part of the original soundtrack. This is a Korean version but the menus and audio are in English and play on region 1 players.
B00DK9FNLY|3.0|Who are we kidding, great concept but poor AI. It's good or what it is but quickly loses it's luster after you move into harder opponents. Maybe it'd be better on a tablet but the controls are lacking in finesse.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is a great device.But if you have a slow DSL connection Chromecast won't sparkle like its designed to.The setup was easy, it took me less than 10 minutes.Luckily I have a 50 mbps Blast WiFi from Comcast which makes Chromecast fly like an F-16 on the internet.Excellent product but you can't run Chromecast on low octane DSL , invest in a high octane connection people!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|A fun action movie, all though it does deviate from the original superman story.  While people familiar with the superman comics may take issue, it's still a fun movie if you can put that aside.
0761169253|5.0|This little book is very helpful to me (aspiring writer) for inspiration and encouragement -- see my review at  [...]
159420411X|2.0|I picked up this book because I thought it would actually concisely answer the question it poses on its front cover, \\"Why do some predictions fail but others don't?\\" It got off to an encouraging start in its introduction by citing historical examples of the failures of prediction and explaining why big data doesn't necessarily increase overall knowledge because of greater opportunities for bias.<br /><br />Okay, fair enough. There is signal (what is true and unbiased) and noise (what is untrue due to bias). We get it, now let's move on to solutions. Unfortunately, Silver doesn't think we grasp this relatively simple concept yet, so he proceeds to write chapters 1-7 (yes, SEVEN chapters) with oftentimes factually dubious examples explaining that bias exists. Well, obviously!<br /><br />Anyone who has taken an \\"Intro to Stats\\" course understands that personal bias is the main reason why predictions fail and that the ways that we correct for them are using mathematical models which make logical sense from an objective view as possible, but even this should be intuitive to anyone with a pulse. If I say three quarters of the way through the season that the New York Mets will win the World Series and they have the worst stats in baseball, doesn't it stand to reason that my prediction not only biased but also factually inaccurate?<br /><br />As I quickly grew frustrated by Silver's unnecessary filler, I decided that it would be best to just skip to chapter 8 and figure out the answer to the book title, which, up to this point, Silver just states in seemingly endless examples. Then, as I started reading chapter 8, guess what I found? Another example. Total waste of time if you actually care about the math involved. If you're a philosophy major, I'm sure this is more your speed. For my money, a textbook would be far more usual than this claptrap (and it wouldn't take 232 pages to answer the question either). I guess you could say, ironically, that there's too much noise, toolittle signal.

B00G4I0DNG|5.0|This movie is heartbreaking. But it is very informative and the public needs to know this! Seaworld should be held accountable for how they treat employees and animals. These whales should be free. This is just wrong! I am glad this film shines light on a problem many people don't see as a problem.<br /><br />My husband and I always assumed the animals were happy, treated well, and well feed but that is not the case.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The Daniel Craig Casino Royal film reinvented Bond in a lot of ways, striping it of the years of history it had built to make it fresh once again. I was scared this wasn't going to work. I liked my history. But it worked!<br /><br />We're now two films past that, and Daniel Craig is still making an excellent Bond. And this film manages to do the impossible: It stays true to what has come before for Daniel Craig, but it also brings things full circle, and returns to the series many of the elements that had been part of its previous history.<br /><br />A great Bond film, and I look forward to the next one!<br /><br />On more technical matters, the picture and audio did not disappoint. Bonus features were enjoyable, if not particularly memorable.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I can count my heroes on one hand and Adam Brown made the list. Cried like a baby through the last chapter. This book was all I could talk about for 2 weeks or so. Eric Blehm did a great job relaying the life, tribulations and redemption of a great and amazing man. Nothing I could say here would do him or his story justice.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This iis to often a neglected king book. It's worth every penny if you're a Stephen King fan but even those who don't care for him (inconcivable) or don't like the supernatural will enjoy this book.
B0056CUZRA|3.0|I like the characters and the background and social mores of the period. The first half was fantastic, while the second half moved too slowly and too much agonizing detail was packed into it.

B000063UR1|5.0|Always loved this movie. Saw it as a kid, never forgot it. A good DVD package. It's a sci-fi classic, and an example of low-budget effects accomplishing great things, whether you accept the environmental message or not.
B00DBR8A60|1.0|terrible. As some other customers' review said, the watch strap is way too short to fit an adult man. It can only fit for a kid. Worse thing is this seller never provides different strap size selection for customer, which Swatch official website always does. They do't even disclose such information. They just always ship the ridiculous smallest one to you.<br /><br />you should be very careful with this seller..
B0062OCNAI|5.0|As a parent she captures the essence of what a mother knows.  As a wife she embodies their story. Her relationships are so tangible and beautifully described.  I think this story is one most would fall into and leave changed.  Thoroughly enjoyable.

B001MSMULG|5.0|Although it seems no end to the introduction of characters in the book. It was a good selection for a book club with lots to discuss.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Every song on this album is great. Alan is extremely successful at singing and wighting country because he understands the venu of Hank Williams and the old bluegrass originals. I think that I'll buy another cd and give it to a friend for x-mas. Just great!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Many people have decried about the ending, but that’s not even half of what makes this book a total and complete fail.<br />Early on, when they announced Allegiant would be written from both Tris and Tobias’s point of views (POVs) I was cautiously excited. I really looked forward to getting to know Tobias better (by seeing things through his mind’s filter). And then I read it…utterly disappointing.<br /><br />Did an editor even look at this manuscript before it went to press? Tris and Tobias think and process the SAME exact way. This is nothing short of poor and amateur writing abilities on display. Doing the two POV’s exposed Roth’s weaknesses as a writer—she could only write one character moderately well. All others were cardboard. No two people think and process the same on earth. A good writer makes it so that the POV ‘voices’ are so different that a reader can open a book to any page, remove name references, and STILL know who’s head we’re in.  Roth failed to do this and this is the ultimate failing of the book.<br /><br />Okay…and for her next book, can someone please help her brainstorm so every plot twist isn’t either solved or thicken by the introduction of a new serum. Seriously. It was like: Ahhh…the world is ending! I know. Oh let’s say there’s ANOTHER serum that gives people longer life and ANOTHER serum that heals wounds and ANOTHER serum that makes mean people smile and ANOTHER serum that tames unicorns and ANOTHER serum that…you get my point.<br /><br />Also, can someone please give the author some romance lessons? I mean…I guess romance in her eyes is “let’s fight and be mad and OH! let’s make out for a chapter, but now I’m mad again, but let’s find some place to make-out.” If that’s considered good romantic tension these days it’s no wonder the divorce rates are rising. But really, again, it just exposed shoddy writing. Roth can’t figure out how to create genuine romantic tension for her characters. Period.<br /><br />And the ending. Yes. We can’t ignore that (unfortunately, because I’d sure like to). Honestly, Roth’s characterization was so weak in this third book (because of the POV failure) that I didn’t even care by the time I got to the last couple chapters. That being said—I’m not entirely opposed to killing off characters (I’ve done so in my own books), but how Roth did it was wrong and ruined the entire series.<br /><br />Allegiant and subsequently its author, Veronica Roth (who, for the rest of this will be known as VRoth) failed readers on so many levels, but more than anything it/she failed a generation of teen readers who are looking for a new brand of hope.<br /><br />See, when an author writes a book they can’t just willy-nilly send it out into the world. They must keep in mind that their words have the power to shape and affect people. An author, especially someone with a huge readership, has a responsibility to their readers. They must offer hope within the pages of their book or it’s a pointless waste of time for the author and more so, the reader.<br /><br />Author William Faulkner said in his acceptance speech for his Nobel Prize, “The writer’s duty is to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.”<br /><br />Does there have to be an “and they lived happily ever after” ending? Absolutely not. Suzanne Collins’s (author of The Hunger Games series) editor put it best when she said that young adult books don’t need a happy ending, but in the end, there must be “a window left open”—a way where we can see that the characters we’ve grown to love can move on from tragedy.<br />There must be hope.<br /><br />Teens today are growing up in a far different world than the one I grew up in (and I’m not that old). I’m of the Harry Potter generation. The books of my youth were stories of teens that could rise up and save the world. My generation was the one told that if we go to college and work hard then we’ll get good jobs and we can accomplish anything. I’m the generation just in front of today’s teens—and the teens of today have watched as the bottom dropped out of my generation’s lives. Where going to college hasn’t landed many of my friends a job, instead it has left them drowning in debt. Where many parents are divorced and a significant amount of people I know have watched their family home seized by forecloser.<br /><br />Teens today have grown up watching this all unravel. For all of the aware part of their lives, our country has been at war. Think about that. They don’t know of an America not at war. Polls show that their vision of success is very different than my teen generation (which is only ten years ago). Today’s teen sees success not as owning a home, graduating college, having a family, or starting a business, instead the number one measure of success in recent polls showed them wanting to be debt free “at some point in life.” That’s it.<br /><br />Contemporary teens aren’t looking for books about teens saving the world. They only ask for the small hope of saving their small corner of it. So popular books for this generation are ones that in the end show that in the midst of a messed up world, you can find your own peace/hope, even if it’s just between you and one other person.<br /><br />Fiction has always been meant to combat the reality of life. VRoth failed us here. She didn’t show us what could be possible. Instead she smacked us in the face with what is. And we don’t need that. Because we’ve all dealt with more than enough loss and hardship and heartbreak. We don’t need books that repeat what we live every single day, we need books that show us that in the midst of a heartbreak world, we can find our own little pod of happiness/joy. That just because the world we live in is going to pot, doesn’t mean we have to lose hope.<br /><br />Whatever her purpose, VRoth showed teens with Allegiant one horrible thing: their life, their struggles, their fight for right…none of it matters in the end. Which leaves teens asking: what’s the point? If nothing I’m working for matters…why try? I know that’s not the message she meant to send, but when an author is careless with their responsibility to readers, this is the kind of thing that can happen.<br /><br />I’ll admit I spent a good amount of time reading Amazon reviews for Allegiant in order to see if I was the only one left disillusioned. I wasn’t. Sadly, I’m in the majority with the one star reviews.<br /><br />Most of the five star reviews I read were people who applauded VRoth on her bravery in “giving a realistic ending.” To this I say: there is a whole genre dedicated to realism. If you want stories that make you feel like someone has stabbed your heart on the last page with no chance for recovery, then feel free to read that genre. But for the ninety-five percent of people that read for enjoyment and escapism, sorry, we want some glimmer of a happy ending. If the Divergent series was meant to belong in the realism genre then it was marketed terribly because right now, all we have are broken promises to readers.<br />Also, even within realism, hope is usually the end game.<br /><br />Take the book The Fault in Our Stars which falls in the realism genre, the teens in the story who fall in love both have terminal cancer. In the end of the book Augustus dies. Why weren’t readers rioting over that? Because a promise wasn’t broken—when they picked up the book they knew they were going to read a story about dying teens so a teen dying at the end of the book was something they were braced for, if not expecting.<br /><br />Even still, The Fault in Our Stars ends with hope. Hazel realizes that although Augustus has died, her love for him doesn’t have to. Death doesn’t have to change the definition of relationships. My grandfather, who is deceased, is still my grandfather because I’m living and can claim him as such. The last line of the book is in present tense whereas the rest of the book was in past tense. Meaning life goes on. This is a hopeful message.<br /><br />VRoth killed her main character which is just hard to do well, especially in young adult fiction. Unless the author brings the character back after death (like Harry Potter), a theme/point is better demonstrated through killing a beloved secondary character like Augustus in The Fault in Our Stars or Piggy in Lord of the Flies (how’s that for old school). Otherwise, just save it for realism or adult fiction.

B005PK1G76|4.0|pretty good.  holds on to &#62;almost&#60; any stroller.  anyone could figure out how to attach it.  two &#34;cup holders&#34;, one per side.  zipper pouch in center closest to you when you push the stroller.  empty center for holding things like cell phone or food.  glad i got it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would give this 5 stars except for the fact that even when you purchase the game it still limits you to how many lives you can have in a certain length of time. If you buy it you should be able to play continuously without having to do something else for 20 minutes while you wait to gain a life.....I get really frustrated with this issue.....just give us unlimited lives after all we are playing it on our kindle and other mobile devices and don't need to draw in &#34;friends&#34; to help us......otherwise it's a 5 star for fun and strategy...

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars I would!  It was great going back to the characters and time period of A Time to Kill.  In fact, after reading Sycamore Row I was inspired to go back and reread A Time to Kill.  John Grisham can weave a story like no other.  Keep up the great writing, Mr. Grisham!

There is a description of more or less 3 things:<br /><br />- The Damascus incident blow by blow<br />- Brief descriptions of other nuclear incidents<br />- The development of nuke command and control stuff overall<br /><br />I found the full top to bottom tour at the Titan Missile Museum a very useful complement to the material pertaining to the Damascus incident.  The great thing  about this book is that is really shows that not only were nukes an interestingly dangerous thing but also their delivery mechanisms, due to the tech and constraints of the deployment.  The implications of large scale extended usage of hypergolic propellants is really  brought out in this book. Also hints of the systems and controls.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Excellent documentary on his life.  He is a very talented and humble human being.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning of his life and story.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best TV show I have seen ... excellent acting, cinematography, script, etc ... all around a very enjoyable experience in every season,
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|2.5 y.o. daughter loves it.. and I admit, I didn't mind watching it either (I'm a 42 y.o man) :-) the story is pretty cool in the fact that Tinker Bell interacts with a little human girl. Put's it in perspective for my daughter I think..  I recommend this one and actually all the other Tinker movies too.  They are all pretty good.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|One of the most disappointing ends to a series that I've ever read. Terrible ending and an even more awful plot line. Veronica Roth, thank you for ruining the entire Divergent series for your readers. You are a terrible author and I will no longer buy any of your books if this is how you end a series: no thought or compassion for your characters or readers.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|It was a great movie! Kids will love it and its an amazing family movie! It fits Monsters inc so well.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Nothing I've read gets to Jesus the man within the time and culture he lived in like this book. If you already know all about Jesus, this will not be the book for you.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Not what I expected, really felt like a graphic novel most of the time.<br /><br />The director had a neat visual style, the actors kept the ham to just a slice each. Malkovich steals the movie, not surprisingly. Bloody, action packed and violently funny. Morgan Freeman was a bit underused.<br /><br />Good popcorn action flick. Looking forward to sequel. Well worth $1.99. Git ONNIT!<br /><br />Catherine's Husband that's too lazy to sign in to Amazon, himself.<br />Mike
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm app.  I have several deadlines during the day and have a separate alarm set for each of them.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS****<br /><br />I really hate the ending to this series, it felt like a total cop-out.  It made me extremely angry and almost seem to invalidate how good I thought the first couple books were.  It even makes me mad writing this as I have to think about the ending again.  Just terrible...
B004XWLIJS|4.0|Awesome movie. Great scenery. Jason Statham style - always great action! Smart, interesting, action packed, love all the water scenes.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|This doesn't work! waste of time and money. We went through nearly 20 bottles and came away with one jagged edged cup, all the other bottles (various thickness) cracked and shattered.  Was really hoping this would work. Great idea though
B000LYK0H8|5.0|Contains the songs that are beautiful to listen to. With percussion. Is wonderful. The composition of opera, instrumental music, is perfect. Beautiful voice. Precious casket.

B00005QB42|5.0|Contains the songs that are beautiful to listen to. With percussion. Use of vocals very well chosen, to excite. Is wonderful.
B00G8P27PM|5.0|I can't wait for my nieces to watch it was so enjoyable even as an adult Disney movies are still the best

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|To me, the show just keeps getting better & better. I was shocked in the last ep, when Rick told Carol to leave...
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend never disappoints! I am a fan of his music! He is an excellent musician and I am gifting and recommending this cd.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The Kindle version of the ESV Study Bible really works well. The notes are outstanding and accessible. The translation is true to the original and very understandable. Highly recommended for teachers and the pulpit.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Pure manifactured garbage.  This talentless, manufactured product know as miley cyruss has never had and will never have talent and now that disney is not going to be promoting her plastic manufactured garbage she is going to be smoking on stage, hanging her tongue out like a mentally handicapped person and whatever the hell twerking is just to draw &#34;im an out of control idiot attention&#34; to push this soulless, talentless,manufactured tripe to even dumber morons......nothing but another shat out product of big corporate record companies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a game that a number of people are addicted to--according to the media reports, those addicted are largely women.  It is an easily played game but also intellectually stimulating.  It is important not to accept the recommended plays until you have really analyzed the board.  I love it.  Be careful because you can use up your account buying moves.
B004F27I3Q|5.0|This is an awesome release.  If you love classic Sabbath then you will love these guys as they have broken the Sabbath code to amazing riffs, vocals, lyrics and flow of great 70's metal.
B001LMAK88|5.0|Oprah identifies her favorite things and so did I for items to be given away to my guests at my 80th birthday party.  Silverado is my favorite western because of the realistic portrayal of the times and also the cast is composed of many of my favorite stars--Kevin Costner, Scott Glen, Danny Glover, Lynn Whitefield, Kevin Klein, Jeff Goldblum to name a view.  It is an action-packed film and probably the first time I paid close attention to Linda Hunt who is now famous as Heddy in NCIS-Los Angeles.  You have to see it.
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|A great buy! This album is still in regular rotation on my mp3 player. I wish I would have discovered him sooner!
B00008EYA5|5.0|This is my favorite detective movie and I watch it every time it appears on television.  I wanted to give away examples of my favorite things at my 80th birthday party and this was one I selected.  LL Cool J, Samuel Jackson and Olivier Martinez (Halle Berry's new husband) are outstanding in their roles along with Jeremy Renner and Colin Farrell.  It is an exciting movie.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|OMG. LMAO! Amazon is so arrogant that they believe that WE NEED them....Hahahahahahahahaha. Meanwhile these bums can't turn a profit. Brilliant idiots.<br /><br />http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/25/amazon-stock-may-be-up-but-the-company-still-doesn-t-make-any-money.html
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I don't see how this can be less than a 5 star album if you appreciate this genre of music.  Lyrically, incredibly smart and funny, with awesome mc skills.  A *great* album.  I'm in the minority that I consider &#34;Recovery&#34; Eminem's masterpiece, and this album has a very different (funnier/confident) tone.  I'm still discovering all the clever hooks in these songs. &#34;Headlights&#34; brought tears to my eyes and Eminem's incredible ability to synthesize extremely complicated relationships and emotions into 4 minutes of tight storytelling is about as good as it gets on this album.  It gets better with every listen.  Thank you, Eminem.
B005DC68NI|5.0|OMG. LMAO! Amazon is so arrogant that they believe that WE NEED them....Hahahahahahahahaha. Meanwhile these bums can't turn a profit. Brilliant idiots.<br /><br />http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/25/amazon-stock-may-be-up-but-the-company-still-doesn-t-make-any-money.html
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Needs more connectivity with Facebook and getting things checked off with lives and moves, etc. Other than that, LOVE this game.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It's an amazing show. Love it a lot. The actors in this show were well chosen. Well played, can't wait for the next season!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is as good as it gets. The main character, Rose, was not as innocent as she was acting. The storyline was riveting and it kept you turning page after page. You definitely won't want to put it down, even at the end.
0307887448|5.0|Fantastic novel about a shy, lonely boy learning that his boyhood hero has died and realizing that his hero has programmed a virtual reality Easter egg hunt where you can win millions of dollars by solving clues. Friends become rivals and shady underlings make the story fast paced and surprises along the way. A must for technology savvy readers. 5 out of 5.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I didn't think it was up to Grisham's standard.  I always look forward to a new book by this author<br />but can't say this was as good as others.  It was disjointed, the characters didn't really connect.<br />However, as usual I did learn a lot about the law especially the laws pertaining to wills.
1905113153|5.0|Probably this is the best book on decorating cakes cream! Simply stunning Edition, I am very happy with my purchase.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Dream Theater's latest release is typical Ass Kicking Dream Theater. Buy it now. Mangini is clearly capable of sustaining the spot<br />vacated by his predecessor.
8866135704|1.0|Made in China.  Yet another classic sold out for the almighty dollar.  Why is it that the prices have not come down if the manufacturer is paying less overhead?  This will be the last Moleskine product I will purchase.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It has a lot of useful and interesting information and I managed to read the entire book in less than a day.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book....a little slow getting started but once you get into the book...in typical Grisham fashion youjust hate to put the book down...you are hooked!
0316227706|5.0|This book was sent to me as a gift.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading and seeing the dogs underwater.<br />It fascinated me.<br />Unique.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|There is a slight problem with the tightness of the clamp spring but it's easily fixable by removing the internal spring.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I guess I was not really enthralled with this story. It was difficult to get through. I didn't develop any empathy for any of the characters. it's a good book to help you fall asleep to.
006202406X|1.0|Truly disappointing. And yes entirely by the ending.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />I loved the series and the characters but I am wracking my brain for a reason why she had to kill Tris at the end. What was the point?<br /><br />I feel betrayed by the author and publisher, who, truly, should not have let it be published with that ending. I could never read another story by this author because I would never trust her again. Because, yeah, it is a matter of trust and betrayal. As readers, we invest ourselves into these stories, trusting that the author will deal with us fairly.<br /><br />I hope the movie will redo the ending, as the author, editor and publisher should have.<br /><br />Way to needlessly anger millions of people for no reason. It's not even that I feel outrage (as some books make you feel). I'm just thoroughly disappointed because she soured the story, characters and anything else I would have read by this author, which now, will be nothing.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Our family loves the music, and voice.  Great musical group & looking forward to their future work & concerts too!
B00005JPO1|4.0|Alright I understand that to many fans, this installment is the Ugly Cousin in the Indy family.  I get why many people feel this way.<br />But at the core this is still Indiana Jones.  Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the mayhem.<br /><br />I love that Marion is back, she was the only female romantic character worthy of Indy.  I thought Shia did a wonderful job as Mutt and that he and Harrison worked naturally with each other.<br /><br />I also throughly enjoy the behind the scene footage etc included on the second disc.  I love to learn about the hows and whys of movie production.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome and cool stuff like the way you can see how it works for me to get the way you can do it
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Excellent story.  Engaging characters.  Satisfying conclusion.  Makes you look at mental health in a very compassionate and empathetic light.<br /><br />I downloaded this book after the movie received all the media attention and awards.  I'm very glad I did.<br />In some spots it was very difficult to put the book down.  The beginning was a bit plodding in places, but stick with it because the ride is worth it.  The way in which Pat grows and how Tiffany develops is engaging and real.<br /><br />I haven't seen the full movie yet, and based on the few clips I have seen I don't think I will.  The movie seems very very different from the novel.  I seems to me that the movie smashed one of the key relationships which is at the core of understanding Pat.  I'll never understand why screenwriters feel the need to radically alter key elements of a novel.
B0037AGASG|4.0|My granddaughter loved this! I, have not listened to this myself. Not my taste n music, but my eight year old granddaughter loves him.
B00F0O8SZK|3.0|This is not one if her best albums.  Everything she does is good but this one seemed a little weak to me.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|We couldn't get this to work for us it never recognized our children when they were playing no matter where we positioned it so we ended up returning it. I found the Kinect Sensor TV Mounting Clip instead and it's worked like a charm.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book about wizards and witches some parts funny and some parts sad. enjoy this wonderful book like I did too
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|I bought the 3D package and feel that I wasted the $25.00. The 3D quality is average at best and looked more like a 2D to 3D conversion.  I thought the story line was bad and hard to follow. It jumps from past to future too many times and doesn't have the slightest resemblance to the original Superman story. There is very little about his childhood and as an adult everyone knows that Clark Kent is superman. The fight scenes with the other aliens are action packed but too long to the point of becoming boring. The ending is the real killer.... After the war with the krypton survivors which leaves the city in ruins witnessed by everyone, Clark Kent dons a pair of glasses and shows up at the Daily Planet and no one knows who he is. Do the glasses give everyone amnesia??????
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this there are plenty of things to keep you busy and you are interacting with the horse by petting it feeding and training it this is allot of fun the only bad part is you run out of gems quick but there is allot to do and get...
B004G6009U|5.0|Grandaughter (and her Nana) LOVED it!  She was thrilled to be able to watch it in her DVD player in the car also.
B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|Loved getting both a digital copy and the actual CD! I love this artist and this might be his best album yet.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I have to say that the writing style of Donna Tartt in The Goldfinch was beyond brilliant. I was captivated by her ability to use what we used to call &#34;run on sentences&#34; to articulate the characters mind chatter in the most amazing ways that would describe in such utter detail many feelings and nuances that I think most would not have been able to find words for. But there they were....words streaming across the pages that captivated and enthralled and now causes me to actually miss Theo. I didn't want this book to end and I recall the characters every day, now weeks after I read the last delicious word.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I got this app and it froze my kindle fire I got so mad I had to get mine replaced because it was frozen. I AM TELLING YOU DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Wasn't sure at first but after the first season I found I couldn't get enough.  Highly intelligent writing and real characters you actually care about, so well done you forget they are just actors and not really the people they are portraying.  Could I actually be fond of lawyers!??
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|One of the best build as you go games I have ever played. Very addictive, a must play game if you like games like farmville.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|An excellent, emotional look into the truth behind orca whales in captivity. While maybe not the entire story, it creates curiosity and desire to know all the facts. I will personally never look at SeaWorld the same. All animal lovers should watch.
0486282112|3.0|In one sense it is more than I expected and in another it is less. Likewise it is sad in most sense and poignant. It's too wandering, giving more information than we needed and run-on sentences are in abundance.  I can see why someone felt it needed another editing just to include the commas. Her sense of connecting thoughts and situations needed help also because it was difficult to know just who was speaking and telling the story.  Other than that, I found out much I had thought about Frankenstein's story as being much more horror than it was, thanks to the movie versions etc.
0812983459|3.0|Parts of the novel were very compelling and interesting but it fell apart for me when the pilgrims joined him.  It also had an unrealistic ending.  The description of the cancer were unnecessary and added nothing.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|Obsession with Daisy is all I could see.  I've never truly understood any director's idea of what Gatsby was all about and to tell the truth I still don't. The Jazz age people were always a little off course because it was quite like the Flower People era. No one knew just what had happened or what they were supposed to do or believe after a serious war.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Delight game to play . Love the little dinosaur and the game set up.My children enjoy the game as well.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem always steps it up when dropping a new lp and this one is no defferent, he goes hard and makes the best album to date
0679746048|5.0|love this book&#60;3 but the photo of the book isn't the same, it's the movie cover with winona ryder on it.
1400069289|5.0|This book has changed my life. It has given me a real understaning of the nature of habbit and helps one realize that they have complete control over the habbit they develop. It's an abosolut must read for anyone trying to develop good habbits or change bad habbits. The style of writing also makes the information easy to absorb.
B008220AVW|3.0|The products cam not as i expected. They are mexico versions, while i ordered the US ones! But they're ok
B00632HWOG|4.0|I don't like all the changes but after a while you get used to it and it offers many options
B007T8BYWE|5.0|Building a picture by solving puzzles is a very unique concept. You are presented with a high quality photographic background with question marks dispersed through out the image. Each question mark represents a puzzle and a picture element such as a bird, dog, flower, etc., though you need to solve the puzzle to see what the image is. To view the complete scene you will need to solve 8 or 10 puzzles. I often found myself guessing what image each puzzle might reveal, which added to the enjoyment.<br /><br />The puzzles are divided into levels of difficulty from easy to very challenging. There is a short but very good tutorial that any age group can follow and does a very good job explaining the process to follow to be successful. The basis for solving the puzzles centers around deductive reasoning. Each puzzle consists of a rectangular image divided into rows and columns of square tiles. You either 'paint' a tile with a brush to keep it or you use a hammer to smash it to pieces to create an empty space. Both actions are accompanied by an appropriate sound. Your shown at the beginning of each row or column how many painted tiles there are and the spacing between individual or groups of tiles. The blank spaces left after smashing tiles is a great help in determining which ones should be painted.<br /><br />First of all children will love seeing each image revealed and make them want to solve more puzzles. In addition, it's a fun and addictive way for youngsters to learn and understand deductive reasoning. But it's just as well suited for the elderly, they too will enjoy the images and it will allow them to exercise and maintain their mental acuity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app for everyone!
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's new take on an angry birds like game.  In this game you don't actually aim you wait until you think the rock is in the right spot and then you press the screen to launch it.  I'm not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews just because the back button doesn't exit the game.  Maybe these reviewers need to be trained in on the home screen button and how it works.<br /><br />Here's the Android lesson of the day. .<br /><br />Step 1 Press home button and watch the device switch to the home screen.<br /><br />Step 2 If app is still running in background hold home button for 2 second to open a recently opened app screen.<br /><br />Step 3 Select app you want to close and hold finger on it for another 2 second.<br /><br />Step 4  A menu box will open with the option to close app. Select and close app.<br /><br />I'm sure the people who are complaining about this app ate the same people who have free game apps that start up with the system and don't ever complain about them the fact that they can't be shut down cause they'll just load back up.<br /><br />Again great game with too many uncalled for 1 star reviews
B004LUS390|5.0|SketchBook Mobile by Autodesk is a feature rich sketching/drawing/painting program that is the free version of SketchBook Pro.  It provides the tools you would expect such as brushes, pencils, markers, airbrush, fill tool, line tool, circles and rectangles, etc. and the controls such as brush size, color selector, opacity, symmetry, line constraints, circle constraints, etc. that you want in a good art program.  It also provides the ability to work with a couple of layers but if you need a greater number of layers, you need to upgrade to the Pro version.  The Pro version also provides a greater number of each of the tools than what come in the Mobile version.  The Mobile version provides an impressive  amount of functionality for a free program, and even better than many of the paid applications.  I own and use Autodesk's SketchBook Pro 6 on my PC along with a Wacom Intuos Pro graphics tablet  which is a setup many professional illustrator's use to make a living.  But for a general use art program to be used on a phone or a tablet,  SketchBook Mobile is one of the best, if not the best.  The biggest drawback's to using this, or any other art application, is generally not the software, it's the size of the screen and the lack of an accurate input device on most capacitive touch devices, such as phones and tablets.  SketchBook Mobile is capable of producing a wide range of varying types of artwork, more so than the physical limitations of the devices it's used on allow.  But, understanding the constraints, I highly recommend SketchBook Mobile as one of the best, if not the best, free applications for use on mobile devices!
B0055B7IPE|4.0|It is a good movie. The score is great and the animation is exceptional. Ed Asner did a great job.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I thought this was a great book -- it was VERY hard to read, and in a few cases I found myself close to tears (I notice a few of the other reviews mentioned this and I completely agree!).  I thank that one of the things that impressed me the most was Ms. Dugard's ability to reflect on her situation with honesty and even (strangely enough) some humor at times.  I can't imagine having to go through what she went through.  I mean, she was basically a sex slave to this twisted, sick pervert -- but somehow, she survived and she seems like a well adjusted person.  This book isn't for everyone, probably -- but if you enjoy reading about true crime I would definitely recommend!

B0012DZ356|5.0|The stories in this book have the surprises and coherence you want from a short story. Not all of Munro's books are this good. Recommended.

0446547654|5.0|Can't say enough about Nicholas Sparks....what a master of the printed page is he.  Every book grabs you from page one.  The characters are fresh, with true feelings that seem to get them into jams but Sparks pulls them together at the end.

B00FAPU0UK|5.0|Pamela loves Bedroom games! She plays them all the time with Rick and Kevin. When she hears about a serial killer on the news she's starts to worry a little, she lives alone in a affluent neighborhood. One night she hears noises and grabs a baseball bat and opens the bedroom door to see who's in her apartment. I really can't say much more without giving away the story. Is it one of her bedroom buddies or the killer. Download now to read more. I loved this story, it has humor, lots of sex and the added thrill. I thought I knew how it was going to end, NOT! Very good job ladies! Can't wait for the rest of the series.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Nice to see some background of Bond, what made him the reckless, martini swilling, woman-loving, villain chasing guy he is. The special effects are spectacular, and the lighting and music are about as perfect as a person could ask for. Easily in my top three favorite Bond films, and vying for the #1 spot. Encore, encore!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I first read Mr Sanderson s work when he completed Robert Jordan s Wheel of Time.  Since then I have read just about everything else he has written.  I am amazed at the depth of his talent. This book was no exception. Thank you for sharing your talent with us. M.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Cool movie. Has a lot of action even though it really is a love story. Both gals and guys will enjoy this movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Honestly, I want to give this a higher rating but I was not expecting the end. I was in complete shock and disappointed. Overall it is a very well written book. I love how it goes between Tris and Four. The main reason  am only giving it 3 starts is because of the ending. I understand why Veronica did that but I was just devastated.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Fabulous movie. Full of action and great special effects. This will be a movie that I will watch over and over again.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Wow. I loved this CD so so much. Great music. I loved every single song on the CD. So good.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Very disappointing.  Gross in parts.  Enjoyed the previous books, but this one was horrible.  No need to read this one!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not only did I end up loving book 2 and 3 of this trilogy even more than the first, but the characters (many of them) stayed with after finishing the book. I absolutely bawled during the last chapter. Thank you SC for an amazing trilogy!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It helped me find words that I did not know the meaning of. It helped me on assignments that I had to know a meaning of a word.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is extremely eye opening!!!- I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in science, history or even just the human experience.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Love this movie!  It has something for everyone!  It is a modern classic.  Tom hanks delivers a brilliant performance in this movie.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|This book just exhausted me.  Eva and Gideon have worked things out, input sex scene.  Oh wait, they are breaking up.  Now they are back together, input sex scene.  They hate each other, input angry sex scene, they can't live without each other, input sex scene.  I just think Eva is the most annoying character ever.  Don't get me wrong, I love a steamy sex scene, but I like it much better when the characters are at least a little likable.
1476733953|5.0|First of all, pay NO attention to reviews comparing this to 'The Hunger Games'. The plot involves a dystopian future. There. That is where all similarity between 'Wool' and 'The Hunger Games' begins and ends. This is a post-apocalyptic novel set in a very bleak and hostile future world where most of mankind has died in what characters euphemistically refer to as 'the uprising'. I simply refuse to give away any of the more intricate plot details. You need to read it for yourself. Suffice it to say, this vision of the future is very dark and grim. However, what sets this book apart in a science fiction sub-genre that is already over crowded with sub par writing is the prose itself. Howey is simply an exceptional writer. If I had to draw a comparison, it would be to Justin Cronin, another favorite author of mine. He just captures so much feeling and emotional impact...he writes on another level. If you're looking for a slam bag shoot-em-up zombie holocaust book, look elsewhere. There are plenty of those, and some of them are even good. But if you're looking for a post apocalyptic adventure on the grand scale of 'The Passage' or 'The Stand', then look no further. You've found your book. Highly recommended. A future sci-fi classic in the making.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|It's the back to the future time machine in lego form.  If you don't like back to the future or legos, then you probably won't like this, but if you like either, then you'll love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The controls took a while to figure out . to fly tap the butten you use to jump twice to fly.In survival mode their are imps which follow you around not burn in day light and sometimes explode when killed give you gun powder.Mobs are skelitin creatures with bows and arrows that will burn in day light when killed give you bones and arows.Zombies are the easiest to defeat that do not have any weapons when killed give you a feather. Never stay out at night! Try to get a sowerd and bed your first day.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Finally took the time to read it. Prompted by my visit to Dallas. Not surprising... Once again King is BRILLIANT! Did not disappoint.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Eminently readable.  Compelling story of Cheryl's journey both physical and emotional.  We are carried along for the ride, immersed in the experience, not just witnesses. Glad I finally had the time to come along for the ride.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Sometimes the software seems to hangup and go in slow motion. Overall the game is habit forming. I seem to prefer the levels where the fruit has to drop.
1451697686|5.0|This is an excellent book which helps one realize how much we actually throw away.  The author describes how her family has drastically limited what they throw away from their household to, well, as the book says, zero.  She gives tips on cleaning products, how to eliminate packaging when shopping, and even wardrobe choices.  In this section, she shows how one can still dress fashionably (after all, she is French!), while choosing clothing from second hand sources.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this as a source, even if one can limit waste in one category alone.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|This product delivers all it promise to and more , I continue to enjoy and look forward to many years of enjoyment. Shipment was fast and the merchant was true to their word the quality is on the high end-Definitely would do business with them again!
0553381695|5.0|Bought this book after watching the TV series.  Bought the first book from a book store and finished in three days.<br />I will defintely buy all the books...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait for the 4th book. I think I like this better than 50 shades of grey! Good book.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a must see movie. Many movies now seem like there is no purpose but to show violence and blood. This movie has its fair share but has an amazing story line to it. I will not give it away but I will say that this is one of those underdog stories. Every time I watch this movie I feel motivated to do better. The movie promotes good guys as the good guys and bad guys as the bad guys. And of course there is great music to accompany this amazing film. This is a must see!
B00005MP58|5.0|Fabulous-  I love watching it over and over.  The scenery, the dialogue ( there is no one like Austen) and the romance---Love it
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Debatable the best movie ever created (this is my opinion). This is a mans movie (I will say my wife enjoys it too) that can be watched again and again . This movie does one of the best jobs at accurately representing reality. This movies shows the hard life of an aging man with a greedy family, psychology of gangs and how they effect the youth, and the ever diverse and changing America. I think it would do a lot of people some good to watch this movie. It will inspire you to do better in your life.
B00AEFY5TI|1.0|Was not happy, the editorial review on the page was misleading, stating this dvd came in the leather jacket packaging. It did not, and now I have to reorder and hope it arrives in time for my daughter's birthday.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Super. Could not quit reading!!! Makes u proud to be an American and from the great state of Texas  Also proud to be a veteran from Vietnam era!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book and quick read.  The imagery the author creates is excellent.  I'm sure the movie will not do it justice.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loveeed the series but i really didnt like that some of the main characters die, but apart from that it was a great book and a great trilogy!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I bought this book based on the Book Review in the New York Times written by Stephen King. When I began to read and still reading, I was intrigued how the author was able to touch on the emotion of losing a love one. I began to cry I was so moved by the loss, confusion, and the daze that the this teenage boy was going through I just wanted to hug him. Based on what I have read so far this book has me intrigued to find out what happens to him. This an excellent book.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Very nice app. I love it. Time saver and space saver. Nice little functions, where you can lunch an application from the program before deciding to keep it or uninstall it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I loved returning to the setting and characters of \\"A Time to Kill\\". This story was not full of twists but made for a very enjoyable read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This a great product. Works as described with no issues. I do wish they would add more services to this but seeing that you can watch anything through Chrome browser, it works fine.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.  it is addicting.  thought it was silly at first but now cant put it down.  its awesome
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast works very nicely, but was disappointed because it won't stream my music<br />and photos like an Apple TV<br />It must work through Google Chrome or something like Netflix<br />Once they include the ability to stream directly from my phone or computer, it will<br />be fantastic as the price is great and the ease of using on different TV's is so easy
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|It locks up my Kindle every time I try to play it. I don't know why. I uninstalled it immediately.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Again an easy informative read of life in medieval England. The combination of novel and history is special. I hope there is a third.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best works which is really saying something considering his body of work. Kept me guessing at every page turn (swipe)! Absolutely recommend this great book.
B00FN811SY|5.0|PLEASE, THIS IS FANTASTIC, BUT I NEED IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE. THE EASE OF FINDING SCRIPTURES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR LEARNING IS AT ONES FINGER TIPS.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|Good book, but Schlosser can't decide whether to write a book about a hair-raising missile accident or the history of nuclear weapons and the cold war.  Once you accept this lack of focus,  the book is a great read.  But before I reached that point, the constant change in direction was annoying.
0316055433|5.0|This is a masterpiece.  I have never highlighted anything in a fiction book before but the writing is so elegant, so meaningful and true that several passages deserved to be remembered.  Donna Tartt takes the reader into the deep chasm the main character, Theo, experiences after the death of his mother.  It is a dark journey but in the end, this beautiful story is pure gold.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it.  I would have given it five stars but I'm stuck.  It won't let me past level 110 with out buying something.  Ugh!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|You either have to connect by facebook, pay money, or play 3 quests (@ 1 per day) to move on. Takes up a lot of space and you can't really move on while you wait. Power ups are not earned, only bought. If it weren't free it'd be 1 star.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|This is definitely my favourite KP album, I love at least half of the album<br />my favourite songs are GHOST, double rainbow, by the grace of God, Spiritual, Unconditionally<br />I love how well thought and pleasing to the ears this album is, with soft and serious music and a good message
B008PZZV8S|4.0|This movie has an exciting plot that will keep you riveted and Matt Damon's acting is superb. I enjoyed it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's hard to say which Grisham book is the best....but Sycamore Row is waaay up there on the list!  It's amazing how you feel like you're right there with these people and you actually know them.  In one sense, you want to keep reading & reading to see how it will end - while on the other hand, you want to read it slowly so you'll remember all the events!  It's certainly &#34;movie material&#34;!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love this book.  Loved all of them.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.  Well done Veronica.  Looking forward to more books by Roth.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so awesome and fun.Parants if you child really what's it you should let them because it's free and kids like it.You should git it for your child.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so totally addictive that I can't stop playing it. The idea is to earn points from the sunshine to buy and plant the plants that will destroy the zombies before they can reach your door, as they drag themselves through your front yard. The good thing is that, because they move slowly, you have time to get enough sunshine to earn points to line the yard with plants. It requires logic and skill, as you need to figure out which plants work the best to &#34;kill&#34; the zombies, or the zombies will eat your brains, and you lose. There are many games and many levels, and, after 3 months', I'm only on the 2nd level! At first it seems easy, but as you go along, it gets more difficult, and frustrating, and you really need to figure out what are the best plants to buy to complete the task. At the end of the first level, we are on the roof, and you need to plant flower pots on the roof, and you have the corn ears that throw globs of butter, and peashooters that throw peas, watermelons that throw melons. Then there's the &#34;fume-shrooms&#34; that throw fumes that look like bubbles. In a game that would be violent, the weapons are hilarious. I was never much of a computer game player, but this one has me hooked.
B007SGM084|5.0|I haven't read an entire book in 13 years. Once I started I couldn't stop. It's hard to believe I actually finished the trilogy in two months!!!!! Can't wait to see the movie!!!
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This mans' explanations are very simple and easy to understand.  His pictures are very good--his fingers are not in the way.  His designs are great.  Many of them can be seen on his generous Youtube site but some of the designs are only in the book
0345373243|4.0|Very good condition considering it is used. Very happy with this. For lack of better words, I love this series. It has all kinds of twists and turns and it is very well written. I love the character of Polgara. AWESOME
6305428042|5.0|Love this movie! Will watch it all year long! My daughter loves this movie and watches it all the time!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Great theme with excellant rendition of original book. This movie will make you think about your beliefs and world views.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I  couldn't stop until I had read all three books. Will keep you on edge until the end. Best I have ever read.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Awesome movie.. Great movie.. Must watch.. Kids will love it and want to watch it over and over.. My son loved it..
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|well written, difficult to predict, holds your interest, enjoyed continuing the characters!!  Grisham always delivers!  Very hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so cool. It is so fun. If you. don't. like the game your stooped. But it is solo fun. cool.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|This is the best non-cable TV show currently running on any of the major networks and from the every beginning it's been an extremely well-conceived story with great characters, amazing acting, and a very compelling storyline which keeps me coming back every week!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|GOOD JOB ON THIS GAME!!!  I'M GLAD WE GOT A VERSION FOR THE KINDLE NOW!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Great thriller! Not as predictable as I thought.  Many twists kind you focused and waiting for the next episode. Enjoy!!
111846446X|1.0|This book is now VERY out of date.  NONE of the examples will work.  Not some, but NONE.  Be prepared for a lot of frustration and gnashing of teeth searching the web trying to get even the simplest examples to work.  It's very well written, and very clear, but badly, and I mean VERY badly, needs updating.  The web is full of people referencing this book and asking why an example from it won't work.<br /><br />This book is really a complete waste of money.  It would be like ordering a dictionary where every definition is completely wrong.  I'm sure it was great, but it no longer corresponds to the product.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like the size and that you can cast from your tablet,phone or computer.i will be buying another very soon.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Fantastic series. Cannot wait for next season to begin. You get to know the entire staff and all the ups and downs!
B00B7G23KQ|3.0|Sort of disappointing to me, I guess that is from watching so many Paranormal Activity movies, always seems the first is the best then sort of downhill.
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|It's very, very, very predictable. Not in the sense that you know what happens because it's loosely based on Cinderella, but in the sense that the writing just gives away what will happen in a couple chapters. It's only similar to Cinderella in the fact that she has a stepmother, two stepsisters, is treated like a maid, and there is a Prince. Everything else is original (but predictable.)<br />It was entertaining though and it does end on a cliffhanger. I will download the sequel and hope it's more surprising.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I'm just a big batman fan from way back in the comic book era to present. This is a great, action packed movie that I found quite enjoyable. I recommend it to others.
B000SEGHT6|5.0|Another masterpiece by kurt vonnegut. Love all his works. Have to say this is one of his best. He conveys his sentiments of the cruelty of the war and of life and death so brilliantly.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Just an all around funny and very enjoyable movie, full of laughs and goofy stuff...but hey it is a nice change. I really enjoyed the pace and difference and recommend it.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Interesting game.  But its main problem is microtransaction system. 5 fights and wait some time before another. Or spend money.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|holy smokes!! this c.d rocks from start to finish. i never knew this album existed till a couple of years ago browsing amazon. and being a loyal badlands fan since day one. i must say that this album is a bit different from the first in a way and a lot different from voodoo highway, production quality and the recording is more clear than voodoo highway,don&#34;t get me wrong there is no filler on dusk and i love every song on here, v.h. has filler and a couple of songs i dont care much for and i think jeff martins drumming meshes in a lot better on here than the last album. ray gillens voice sounds the best on here . and i hate say it but i think this recording stacks up not too far from the first badlands album, in a way!!! if you are a ray gillen or a jake e.lee fan then you need to get this third and last badlands recording.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Bought it for my dad- he told me - THIS is what I want for Christmas. So I got it for him.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love to play this game because it's always changing. It's never just the same boring stuff. I love it sooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!
B0080R7Q70|5.0|I buy mostly CD's that I listened to them 1st and rated them 5 stars A Must for any Symphonic Prog Lover
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Awesome game I used to play it on Facebook but it started getting complicated. This version is easier and oh so cute
B00BDPW7XE|5.0|I buy only albums that I listen to them first and if I rate them 5 stars I buy the CD after... This album like others from the band is a must listen too for lovers of progressive rock in the Neo-Prog or Symphonic Prog genre!
B00F87A7HG|4.0|A solid, quality studio effort.  There is no filler to be found on this album; I am very pleased with it.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I buy mostly CD's that I listened to them 1st and rated them 5 stars A Must for any Crossover Prog Lover
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install and use; watching shows that we can't get on satellite TV; very satisfied with item and performance
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|I buy mostly CD's that I listened to them 1st and rated them 5 stars A Must for any Crossover Prog Lover
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Album is fantastic! Eminem is back at it again! Favorite rapper of all time and I am still impressed by his new s***.
0679809015|4.0|My son loved this book, and still does a year later.  It has all of the animals that he loves and knows and also helps introduce him to all of the sounds they make.  My only issue would be that the book is so small.  When we got this for him he was still too tiny to hold the book himself and turn the pages.  So with the book only being 3&#34;x3&#34; it's hard for my husband and me to hold the book for him; not impossible, just more difficult.  Also, the glue on the binding came unglued after reading it twice.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Fabulous as always for a Grisham book.  Keep writing! I look forward to another read soon. Maybe a takeoff on a former book.
0689835604|5.0|My son loves this book!  So much so, when he ripped the flaps off of our original book that we received as a gift we purchased the book again.  The bright colors keep their attention when they're little.  And the different body parts that this book teaches are simple enough that they're learning them while playing peek-a-boo.  Just don't leave this book lying around if your baby likes ripping off flaps.  They come off very easily.
B007REV4T8|1.0|Just who are these Secret Service people supposed to be protecting? They obviously have no concern for hundreds of pedestrians/motorists as they careen down every narrow London street and roof top causing one accident after another. No surprises here. A long, boring and very predictable film.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND GOT A COMUTER TO USE IN YOUR VEHICLE..WELL THIS IS THE ONE.<br />I USE IT VERY OFTEN IN MY WORK. IT GETS ME ALMOST RIGHT TO THE HOUSE'S FRONT PORCH. WELL, MAYBE NOT THE FRONT PORCH, BUT AT LEAST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE IN MOST CASES. I NEEDED ACCURACY AND IT DOES THE JOB
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is  the bomb and I think it easy to play and it is the best thing to do on your free time
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hooked on this series from day one. Reread it fir a refresher for the new movie!! I'm so excited!! Yeah!!
B001BRJZPW|5.0|I bought this as a gift for Christmas for a friend. She doesn't have a Blu-Ray player yet...which is truly the best way to experience this movie; but she will love it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a great read, it has a very interesting and surprising plot and is written exceptionally. I highly recommend it :-)
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoy reading stories centered around a character that I can continue reading stories about in book after book.  I am glad that I discovered these books by Lee Child and the character Jack Reacher.  By the discription of him, I can picture him in my mind with every page I read.
B00ALGW286|5.0|Moscow Dreams is the story of Marina, a young Russian girl in Moscow during the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.  Like Russia itself, Marina is moving, with some anxiety and much hope, toward what she hopes will be a future where her dreams will be fulfilled.<br />Ms. Gousseva has written a touching, poignant, and very interesting story that skillfully interweaves the human and the historical.  Marina, the very serious student, comes of age amidst the tumult of the breakup of the USSR, the failed Communist coup attempt, and the beginning of change in the political, social, and economic spheres of Russia at that time.  But while the historical and political backdrop of the novel is described authentically and in clear detail, the strength of this novel is that it is a very human story.  Despite the magnitude of change, the daily concerns, hopes, dreams, and sometimes follies, of Marina and her friends, are the strong point of this work--as they should be.  Marina's concerns for her studies, her love for her family, her friendships and social interactions, her inevitable interest in boys and her dreams comprise the heart of this novel.  Ms. Gousseva relates all with sincerity and a confident, direct, and lean style.  I highly recommend this book.
B005HEPIDS|4.0|As with all versions of the franchise, there were a few episodes I wasn't that into but overall it's my favorite. Was never really a fan of Kate Mulgrew but thought she did a great job as the only female captain in any version of Star Trek. Liked the whole premise of the series. Melding hostile crews thrown together out of necessity into a family by the time they made it back home. Even helped a Borg reclaim her humanity.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the most riviting books (all 3) I have ever read.  It takes a lot for me to stay with 1500+ pages.  I found Christian's background and life to be very real, at least for some of us.  This turned out to be one of the most unconventional love stories I have thus far read.  If you do not just concentrate on the sex you can gain a lot, learning about humanity.  It is a very worthwhile read for the reality as well as the novelty.  Personally I geive it at least eleven stars ***********
B00BD99JMW|5.0|An amazing end to a remarkable series. Incredibly well-written. Thank you to Veronica Roth for writing the ending that the story truly needed.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Much too long (overindulgent Tarantino, which extends to his 'acting' in the film as well), but passages are well-played, especially Samuel L: Jackson as the 'Uncle Tom' figure, and Christoph Waltz in another striking outing. There are striking visual moments, but they get a little sucked under in the rising tide of QT's ego here.
145210655X|5.0|I've always wondered what it would be like if Vader had a toddler. Now I know. Arrived immaculate and well kempt.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|This game is the best, but I need more friends to join me. Please copy my I'd to become my farm friend! Thanks! FAVCGWS
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I had high expectations.  I am disappointed.  I hate the back and forth between Tris and Four perspective.  Multiple times I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who's perspective I was reading.  It was annoying and boring.<br /> I really loved Divergent.  I even liked people dying.  But, this book did not do Divergent justice.  This book did not do the characters justice.<br />I can never get back the hours I wasted reading this.  I will NOT waste any more of my time or money on Veronica Roth.
030759565X|5.0|Fabulous cookbook with lovely photos, interesting recipes and most aren't too time consuming. It would be a great gift for a foodie. And her blog is great, too.
1400032717|5.0|the best book i have read in several years.  i immediately lent it to others to share a great story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is not only fun but also challenging. You have to think about your moves so it works your cognitive abilities. It's a must download you won't be disappointed.
0307887960|2.0|After trying this diet, and then switching to a diet that is mostly raw greens and beans (see any books by Dr. Fuhrman) I can say that the high protein made me feel tired. Also, I hit a plateau after 10 pounds. I thought I'd love it because I love steak and roast chicken, but honestly, too much animal meat turned me off after a while. On the fresher, mostly veggie plan, I felt crummy for the first three days, then my mood and energy began to lift and lift. After two weeks, I felt like my ADD was not an issue, and I was much more productive and happy. I also felt my puffy tummy flattening as I've never had it do before. I've been three months now on Dr. Fuhrman's &#34;Eat to Live&#34; plan and I still feel great. It is not an extreme approach, and yet I lost 18 pounds without feeling anything but healthy and happy. It is a lifestyle, no more roller coaster of dieting for me. Consider live, fresh fiber rich foods!
B000002MVT|5.0|Wow, where do I start with this compilation of Texas's greatest Little Ole Band from Texas ! I love this cd. Alot of these songs didnt get alot of airplay , but they are some of my favorite ZZTOP song's of all time .These songs are the reason I love ZZTOP , Oldman, Hot,Blue and Righteous,Sure got cold after the rain fell, Bron Sugar,I need you tonight, 2000 blues ! All these songs on one cd. ya gotta get it.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|This  was a great version of Superman. Very close to Reeves version. I loved it from beginning to end. I don't know what movie a lot of reviewers watched but they were not watching Man of Steel. Fabulous movie.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Ethan Hawke did an excellent job in this movie.  Would watch again.  Great ending.  A little on the gruesome side, but still good.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Remote, like Rework, is a quick and easy read. Yet it packs a punch. As the owner of a company with both an office and remote workers this book will be referenced time and again as we move forward... Remotely.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was amazing! I'd rate it a 100 out of 10! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the these types of books! Can't wait for the movie!
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Alright; so this was a nice Halo preview as to what could be done with a large budget to produce a movie. Now, this was indeed catered to current players, readers and people who know the Halo lore.<br /><br />This movie was excellent in both cinematography and special effects. I give it a 5/5. Here's to hoping a Halo movie comes out of this soon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't get enough of Gideon and Eva! This literary couple is my all time favorite! You will love them too!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a good book never saw the ending coming was very interested have recommended it to other people I had the audio and it was very well told.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is up there with his first two.  It was hard to put down.  It was enjoyable reading.  Tfisenberg@aol
B00BD99JMW|5.0|With the, somewhat, bad reviews I was a little leary about this  one but I wanted  to finish the series... So glad  I did!! Ya the ending sucked but  it was a good fit for Triss. It was a bit  hard for me to read the last 100 pages, detailing with a, very, recent loss but it was very close  to what I am currently going thru. This series was amazing!! I have never read a series that I love all the books in the series, even Hunger Games for  monotonous to me, this didn't. I highly recommend this series!!!
B0014NDXGA|3.0|The compartment for the battery took a 3 volt instead of a 9 volt as originally advertised.  The 3 volt batteries are a little harder to find and more expensive.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is a great DVD collection.  The series is great and it lifts my spirit when I watch an episode.
B00EJYGQFG|5.0|I Love This Song It Is One Of The Best Songs Of 2013, One Of The Best Lyrics In This Song Is &#34;ONE SECOND I’M A KOONS THEN SUDDENLY THE KOONS IS ME&#34; Love It &#60;3
B003G4W49C|4.0|LOVED THE STORY OF ENDER. IT BUILT UP SO WELL BUT ENDED TOO ABRUPTLY. I DIDN'T WANT IT TO STOP.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great program for freeing up memory.  Works great on the new Kindle HDX.  I have used it for about a week now with no problems.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If you like horses it's fun!  Passes the time when you have nothing to do.  Graphics are really good and nice animation.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Andrea Bocelli's concert in Portofino is beautifully done and is very relaxing with the scenery and the soothing nature of his voice.  He is simply one of the best singers in the world.  The guest violinist did a beautiful job, too, as did Chris Botti.  David Foster did a great job putting this all together.  I think the only thing better than listening to this dvd would to have had the pleasure of being there in person. Sigh!
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Another great Fire Maple game!  Really enjoyed - keep 'em coming!  No hidden objects and moderately challenging but not too difficult that you get stuck.
B00ENIR864|4.0|It worked first time I tried it.  I do not have a popular tablet nor a smart phone.  I downloaded to a off brand tablet and it worked. Very easy to use. Served the purpose for me.
B008RV5K5E|1.0|Speak of it as if it takes up where the last 1 with Hale left off and turns out to be just a cartoon figure that's not worth watching.Now buying s another thing  I wouldn't waiste my money to buy a BluRay of a cartoon when I can buy a good  movie with real people portraying the actual figure and not be animated with a pencil with overlayed talking of someone..If I want something in that nature,I'd buy Disney where theres some humor and at least a good  story that all can enjoy..
B00FPH6M82|4.0|COULD'VE BEEN BETTER, BUT STILL A PRETTY GOOD FLICK, WORTH A WATCH! YOU CAN'T DENY THATS WILL SMITH'S SON!! (EARS)  PEACE
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I can't believe that Veronica Roth chose to play out the events in this story the way she did. I feel like this novel does not belong in this trilogy.<br />I also can't believe she chose to end the way she did. While I can understand her reasons from a literary perspective... Come on! JK Rowling could have easily killed off Harry Potter. It would have been so poetic as well. But she realized that she would be committing author suicide and conveniently threw in a loop hole. When you're the author you can do that!!!!  I am so frustrated with the ending and think that this book deserves to be replaced with something of quality.
B00F8MIIKO|3.0|Typical sequel, not as good as the first, by far, but fans of the original will enjoy the action.  Harder to follow storyline than original, but great characters and touching moments.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great book by Grisham<br />Spell binding it keeps you reading never once put the book down a must read
B006TVQU6C|5.0|This is a very well built computer case.  It is thinner than the 300 and higher models of Antec, but the black interior makes it look much better and really it does not feel cheaply made.  Very easy to work with, fits a full ATX board with video card, and larger power supply with no problem.  Hard drives mount from opposite side which is a change, but makes cable management better.  USB 3.0 on the front is nice, mesh filter in grill for dust, plenty of fan spots, and the lights are not exceedingly bright.  Would recommend and buy again.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game is super duper fun! But on the desert level I keep falling out of the world at spawn!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is fun and very addictive and great to play to pass the time. it works great on my tablet. my two year old son loves playing the game with me. it great for hours of fun
B000SMWUPS|4.0|It was great while it lasted.  After a while one of the straps broke but was very useful for a little while.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It is a very fun game.  With lots of interesting quests. The graphics are colorful and amusing to look at.
039916409X|5.0|I'm new to tapping.  Had read lots of great inspiring comments/testimonials so wanted to be open minded!<br />A few of the chapters were absolutely huge AHA moments!!!!<br />I would Especially recommend  the financial and goal trauma chapters for anyone whose struggled thru the whole Financial/Real Estate crisis and lost much!<br />She helps with working thru the personal shame and trust issues that have seeped into the soul and has made you second guess or dismiss the excitement of a creative new possibility!<br />Margaret has a great way of explaining how to tap in the videos that come as a gift with purchase but I should have probably started with a beginners instructional book or video first!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Giant monsters. Giant robots. Fighting. Explosions. And the guy from It's Always Sunny. What more could you ask for? Plot? No.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|this is the all time love story - have your Kleenex handy at the end, you will need it !
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Whilst the idea had merit it didnt quite hit the mark. I felt like I was reading about characters from the big bang theory. Felt like after such a detailed story it ended very quickly.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I just loved that series.  Great to get all the episodes in Blu-Ray.  Could have done without the collectible Cylon, but what the heck.
B000URWYTS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!<br /><br />Truly inspiring in relation to Frank Lloyd Wright,but more so about the life of Mamah, an outstanding woman we can all admire.  I couldn't put it down.  The writing and research were incredible!  It is an honor to have experienced such a noble work of art!<br /><br />Isis Adams, M.Ed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Drawn to the book due to the movie release soon to come out, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! I absolutely loved this book. It's been years since I've been able to really immerse myself into a novel and Ender's Game is the one that broke the drought. I look forward to reading the next in the series.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good story...very intriguing!  I couldn't wait to find out what the secret was, and now I can't wait to see how the story ends.
B007V693YK|4.0|search could me better you have to be 100% correct in typing names other than that it,s pretty cool ok
B001OSIV62|5.0|Great documentary of something that will NEVER happen again!  It's great that this film was made and that we can look back at a time when such wonderful and MAD escapades that show the full potential of the human spirit were possible.  Now that the buildings are gone, and now that the memory of such a magnificent and daring feat has been replaced in our minds by the memory of  one of the most dastardly actions we have ever known, it is good to be reminded that there is something in this world beyond evil.  Watching this film brought me back to my youth.  Maybe what Philippe did was totally insane but it was also totally glorious!
1572815108|5.0|really nice, very inspirational, nice colors, good quality and really good designs  nice size is really good buy. im happy
098555780X|4.0|Good book on starting paracording show intro to knots used in the hobby could be a little better illustrations thou.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I read this book in one sitting! By the time I got the end I had tears running down my face. If you want to know what it is like to be a Navy Seal team member and to be 4 men up against 100+ Taliban warriors way behind enemy lines you should read this book!
0985557834|4.0|Nice book on the subject, good companion book to vol. 1 which they would show more detail on using buckles and the like.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Thought provoking, answers many questions. I recommend this book highly, so simple and life changing. Can't wait to get started.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you like tool then buy it! Every Tool song rocks. Tool is totally totally awesome! XxxxxxIf you like tool then buy it! Every Tool song rocks. Tool is totally totally awesome!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Watched it with my girlfriend because she never saw it before. She thought it was an awesome movie and will watch it over and over from time to time.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Game is very well structured with good controls, very nice graphics, and flowing storyline. N order to advance though you will have to buy gems to compete quests, or play forever in zones you have outgrown .
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Very entertaining but it's heavy writing. Loved how she took me on the road with her all the time. She spends too much time on details that sometimes are not necessary , still loved the book and would recommend it to anybody.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|One of the best books I've read in ages. Instead of speed reading, I'm actually savouring every single word. Excellent!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Very entertaining! Nothing to do with the movie this is way better it's detailed and fun! Love it, easy reading and fun
B00B52F278|3.0|The series could have been better if there were more battles instead of talking back and forth at each other. The final series came to an end with a very dull ending which I will not spoil for those who have yet to see it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Wish we didn't have to pay for the two episodes our TiVo screwed up, especially since we had Prime, but it certainly was worth it.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|I totally regret the money spent on this movie-- WAY TOO MUCH CGG -- and stealing?? Really?? Stealing?  Such a disappointment!!  Too much brooding, and way too fragmented ... I thought it was quite awful.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I couldn't imagine Jane Austen and P.D. James on the same shelf.  Adam Dalgleish and Elizabeth Bennett?  Well, I'd give it my attention should anyone write the story.  There are many story lines but none very adaptable to most writers,
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Heartbreaking documentary brings to light the harsh reality of what goes on at seaworld. Thank you so much for making this, I always thought seaworld was an amazing beautiful place but now I know that I was blind.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I liked her Harry Potter stories but am very put off on her &#34;adult&#34; stories.  I will find other authors for that.
B004GKMV16|5.0|Again, Rutherford's books are not books I find it difficult to put down, but are very satisfying books to read.
B00338QENI|2.0|Our book group read this and I wouldn't ever have read it but for that.  Don't misunderstand, it is well written and of interest to researchers but one of the few I was tempted to not finish.  At my age I read to be entertained and refreshed.  This book did neither for me.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|It was a good story although sometimes a little contrived.  I was disappointed with the ending which made it rather like a T.V. serial - wait for the next episode (or next book).  I felt the book should have been complete in itself.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|It was awful. What's there to explain? It was a real stinker and I am very fortunate to have only spent 99 cents to view it instead of what it would have cost me in the theaters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Serves the first book justice and love the drama to it!!! Couldn't put this book down, everything is about to go down for Katniss and shocking secrets on what happens to Peeta and district 12!! Reading Hunger Games before anything else.
B00F9040HU|3.0|Good game but original Quest was better. Worth $2.99 so it's either greed or inflation. Like films, it's hard to come up with a good sequel.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I loved this movie because the story line and acting was great!  I was kept on the edge of my seat till  the end
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great series. Great scenery and spellbinding, couldn't wait for the next installment. Recommend this if you love a good mystery.
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|for a Shakespearean comedy it isn't all that funny (and yes, Nathon Fillion is great) but Amy Acker and Alex Denisof still have no chemistry.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Terrific book. I'll not look at the past presidents or the sitting president quite the same way again. The book was well written.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I dislike it when games say they are free and then hit you up for in game purchases.  It's deceptive.  Also it's a card game.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I would love to say that the album is great but there's always a BUT.<br />This album is less than her albums and EP's from the past. Everybody or most of the people can say that they loved more The Fame: Monster than The Fame.<br />I am a big fan of The Fame album, I love every song of the album and the special editions songs.<br />This album can be called ARTPOP but maybe is because they focused the lyrics in ART and nothing less, which is the same of the last album. In her first album, she was more involved with the process and she was more excited to work with RedOne and everybody who made the album a hit.<br />Every Artist has one CD that is not so great as everything else. Ex; P!nk with Try This, Eminem with Encore, Rihanna with Talk That Talk, Michael Jackson with Invisible.<br /><br />The CD is good and well made, but if you are someone like me who loved the first two CD's that she made and she was more in involved in the process, then just hear the album and don't listen.<br /><br />I am told in my Student Career that every Artist has 5 to 6 years of Spotlight, I think Lady GaGa spotlight is getting off. Madonna passed away her moment 20 years ago, now Lady GaGa will be a history in the making just like Madonna.<br />Now I think is Miley Cyrus moment, which is something that I don't like, I don't know who decided but its really sad.<br /><br />But like I said, Its not a bad album, just not the same that we loved.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is an excellent author!  This novel holds the reader's attention from the front cover to the back cover.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Aside from the problems with the movie itself (wanton destruction of Metropolis...but no bodies; the way Snyder offs Pa Kent), this media package is very weak.  So weak in fact the special features includes a Hobbit short (MAN OF MITHRIL?)!  Granted, special feature are never either 'special' or 'features':  they never really add any value to the actual feature itself.  They very rare exception are assemblages of outakes, but even those are often lacking.  Special Features are another marketing ploy to allow studios to charge more than the feature product is actually worth.  That is true for this edition of MAN OF STEEL.  I suggest waiting for one of the future editions (Director's Cut, Special Edition, Anniversary Edition, Ultimate Edition).  You know they're going to re-issue these discs:  maybe the Special Features in one of the future editions will make it worth the price.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The book series itself is good, but Veronica Roth, the end STINKS!!! It is inconceivable to me how you could put your characters thru what they go thru (and us the readers) only to have this ending. Un-Like!
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|No. Just no. Having a widowed woman of 51 acting like a moronic teenager isn't funny or cute. This book is a disaster. I loved the other books, so that made me sad, because I wanted so bad to love this one too. But I couldn't. Awful. Just awful.
B00F35BV64|5.0|An amazing addition to the series.  Great feelings of nostalgia while being creative and new. I enjoyed it even more than I expected.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Gives insight into what's happening in Afghanistan!  I enjoyed it as much as 'Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splended Suns'
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Excellent in almost all aspects of this movie! Only some minor flaws in storylines & acting. Very enjoyable to watch from beginning to end.
B00EVW04PE|5.0|great movie lots of action. Jamie and channing play very well together in this movie. Hope to see them together in furture movies.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Saw Wayne Shorter perform this live an the Monterey Jazz festival for his 80th birthday, it sounds very much like I saw the concert
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Had no idea of how the vision started with Amazon, great concise read of a company I've come to purchase from regularly, and certainly value the customer experience Amazon espouses!
0545626382|5.0|Great series.  Loved the story and you felt like you were involved in it, with everyone.  Scarey thought!!!  I was so glad to have all the books so I didn't have to wait to get the next one.... I just HAD to read and read and read... it was great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging game , it's free and keeps me occupied, almost everyone I know plays the game, it's like we are in competition
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Really great show!!! Would recommend highly!! Wish it was still one the air. Great cast...would love to see more shows like this one
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was Very well written, as always! Keeps your attention thru out! Can't wait for the next one... .or two..!!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Just for fun.<br /><br />Man of Steel: Five stars right up to the last moments and then the flight falters….a bit. I disagreed with the “thumbs down” reviewers in their assessment of most of the film, until the last few minutes and then I agreed with them: thus four stars out of five.<br /><br />The first two hours of the film was a surprise and generally a delight. But the last 10 minutes had the feel of a film where the script, the direction and the production did not know how to close the deal with the viewer effectively. Here is where they went wrong: An overly long fight scene between Kal-El and Zod, an inexplicable death dealing neck twist, and the emergence of a completely undisguised Clark at the Planet left me and those I was with a bit let down.<br /><br />The combat went on and on and on and on and was the same set of moves at different toppling skyscrapers. Lop five minutes off of it and it improves.<br /><br />Superman does not intentionally kill others- that’s one of his DC Canon hallmarks. Why couldn’t there have been a “Kansas Farm Boy” bit of wisdom?…..have Kal-El warn Zod that just as super-hearing can overwhelm so can the other powers and then have Zod burn himself out overusing his heat vision. Kansas wisdom: take it slow, moderation in all things, know your field before you plow it.<br /><br />And then Clark is “welcomed to the Planet” (a lame word play? in a city that is all but destroyed with a smoldering Smallville somewhere off in the distance) this whole things seemed surreal. How can EVERYONE NOT recognize him? His public presence during the face off with the Fascist Kryptonians certainly was filmed by someone in this day of ubiquitous camera phones. Why not dare to take the Martian Manhunter approach where his physical appearance as John Jones is completely different from J’onn J’onzz? What if Clark had altered features like Lemont Cranton, the Shadow, did? I suppose it is too much of a chance, too big of a gamble, too far a reach…but it would have gone a long way it making his so-called “secret identity” a bit more real.<br /><br />Still I loved the origin story with all its angst. We loved the two dads (and saw hints of the borderline personality in Jor-El that we got used to in Smallville). Their combined presence (in his Kryptonian genes and his Kansas jeans) are evident. We loved his “I can’t help myself” heroism.<br /><br />The Kryptonian science was interesting if not spectacular. Zod and gang were nasty enough. Lois was outstanding- a modern go-getter with as much drive as Kal-El but more certainty. She is Kal-El’s partner almost from the start. Indeed a common theme in the film, as in Smallville, is that despite all his power, Superman cannot do it without a little (and sometimes a lot) of help from his friends: Ma and Pa Kent, a clergyman, a general, a colonel, a scientist, and his “love at first sight” star crossed lover Lois.<br /><br />Will there be a sequel? I sincerely hope so.<br /><br />Afterthought- As I watched the film my mind wandered once or twice to a more serious interpretation of the films underlying themes. Jonathan Kent raises the issue of “being different” with Clark and worries that he will not be accepted, or worse, will be rejected and attacked, if his true nature becomes known. In our oh-so real world the question is not a new one. The danger posed by “aliens” who superficially look like us but unless they have been fully acculturated could bring us down and then replace us was played out. When key characters recognize that: “He is one of us.” It’s a turning point in the film. Could it be a turning point in our discussion of immigration, foreign policy, caring for the needy etc.  Hmmmm….too far a reach…but it would have gone a long way it making his so-called “secret identity” a bit more real.<br /><br />Still I loved the origin story with all its angst.

B00003CXB4|4.0|This will always be one of my all-time favorites, and I was actually really glad to find it here for less than $15. I mean, I'm gonna be honest when I say I don't like paying more than $15 for a DVD, and what do you know? It was for less than $10. AND it got here pretty fast.<br /><br />The DVD works great, but it always freezes on one scene, and skipping it is pretty difficult. It's frustrating, but other than that, the DVD's fine.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Games, apps, time wasters, mindless activity, hand eye coordination, - call them what you will but each game, app or whatever you want to call it keeps the mind working, solving problems, and looking for different things or situations. They (whomever they are) decided ages ago that these and video games - if they were not killing and such, taught the child hand/eye coordination and gave them better problem solving skills... Who knew???
B000063UR2|5.0|I was looking for this movie all over the place and finally found it here for a great price! The cover was a little worn, but the DVDs themselves worked perfectly - no scratches, no skipping, nada. Love it.

B008ALAHA4|5.0|Awesome, works perfectly with my MagCozy.  Price is crazy but is expected from an apple product.  At least they let you use your old adapters with the new air, that is nice.
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|Another app - when you are age challenged, you know those younger than you will enjoy things like this and will breeze through it at lightening speed....My grandson could do it, and my great-grand-daughter will be able to do it in a couple of years.  She isn't 18 months yet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Listen guys from Adam to Jesus it's been a bumpy ride but really people complaining just contact the creators of the app or pray because we're Christians are life not perfect because we are Christians. So like I said having issues pray or contact someone Jesus would tell you to do that right guys...lol

0316204366|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell and his writings are a telling example of the old saying &#34;It's more to it than meets the eye&#34;. He goes way deeper below the surface and always comes back up with surprising and interesting angles on how to look at life. David an Goliath is no exception, in fact I rate this title as his no 1 so far.
B00699XMCO|5.0|Owl at home is a fun and easy to read book. Children and their parents will enjoy sharing in Owls adventures. Have you ever made tear water tea, or had the moon follow you home, and what about those two bumps that appear at the foot of the bed when you lay down? Join Owl in all these adventures.
0792846710|4.0|This is an absolutely stupid movie.  That is exactly why I bought it.  My son hates clowns, and I thought he'd get a kick out this and HE DID!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story is located in a rich detailed history of Afghanistan; the characters are delineated with clarity and you identify with them in their lives. The pace of the writing keeps you engaged with the story and you are not unnecessarily bored with the details of setting that are irrelevant to the story. A fantastic read. I recommend this book to all who are interested in learning about other cultures while reveling in a well written fiction.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Great casting, well written dialogue and even some good character development. Just the right mix of cheesy, witty and mockery.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another excellent book by a great story teller. A fun plot with twists and turns. Glad to see Harry Rex Von in action.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|An excellent read. Once you get the characters  figured out. I enjoyed the story's plot, loved  how the characters actually came to life before my eyes. I would highly recommend this book.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The idea is interesting,but not novel...There is a book called the City and the Stars that I read many years ago that is much much better,although written in a much different way.<br />The Allegiant book does not really ever become interesting although one goes along with it. Characters are drawn in  a fuzzy way.They do have interesting features but do not keep in your memory .They get confused. It is more a series of events and portraits rather than a coherent  work.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|a lot of people hated this book for the way it ended the story, but I thought it was better than many other trilogy endings I've read.  It gave good closure to the rest of the story.  I almost didn't buy this book because of the reviews but I'm glad that I did.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS]<br /><br />After reading an author for as many years as I've read King, I have become accustomed somewhat to the writer's habits and other signature moves to the point where I can almost predict them. And when those habits and signatures aren't there, when a writer you've read for years is off his or her game, it becomes as palpable on the brain as the lack of salt feels almost injurious to a gourmet's palate.<br /><br />That's how I felt when I read Doctor Sleep, the sequel to King's masterpiece to The Shining. I'm almost at pains to call it a sequel, because it feels so utterly separate from the mind and world in which the first book was written that one could easily read this book without having read The Shining and not miss much of a beat, but there is some bridging there between the first two books for those who have read The Shining.<br /><br />That being said, the book started off very strong. Dan Torrance, once known as Danny or \\"Doc,\\" has grown up and he's wrestling with the alcohol demon, in much the same way his father did, only he has his childhood nightmare at The Overlook as well as his often torturous psychic ability still riding shotgun. He's a bit of a nomad, drifting from town to town after he's burned enough bridges (usually thanks to the antics he gets up to while on a liquor binge) but he tries to make the best of things working as an orderly at various hospice centers where he helps to usher dying patients gently into the afterlife. This whole side of Dan's life is not given a whole lot of gravity or dimension, however, and it left me wondering what exactly he does for these people that is so special. That was my first cue that King was not entirely on his game here, but I'll get to that in a minute. At any rate, Dan finds a home in Frazier, New Hampshire, a sleepy little town populated by good salt of the earth types that we like immediately. Dan also starts going to AA meetings, and we start to see him climbing out of this black hole he's been living in most of his adult life.<br /><br />As the plot evolves, we met Abra Stone, a girl born with an immense psychic ability that dwarfs what even Dan experienced as a child. She's telekinetic, telepathic, can travel into other people's minds from great distances, and can even leave messages on a blackboard from miles away. The stuff this kid can do is pretty amazing, and as she grows older and starts to interact more with Dan (which is inevitable), I liked getting to know her and her family more. That's one thing I really appreciated about this book. King's signature for developing heartfelt and realistic relationships between his characters is as strong as ever, and it left me wanting more. It is the only thing that kept me reading.<br /><br />Of course there is a third element at work here, and it is that of the True Knot, a band of psychic vampires who feed off of psychic energy called \\"steam\\" rather than blood. They travel the country in bands of RV's looking for their next victims. They are an interesting group, all with carnie names like Rose the Hat, Snakebite Andi, Jimmy Numbers, etc. They have a deep and abiding love for one another, but they are also monsters and child killers and they're desperate for more steam (times have been a little lean of late). After their leader (Rose the Hat) discovers her \\"white whale\\" of a steam head in Abra, they are determined to get her and here is where we start getting doses of actual conflict between the three stories King has been building.<br /><br />And here is where things start to go off the rails. King for whatever reason begins to lose interest in his story. Perhaps it's because it's more plot-driven than a lot of his work, but when it came time for Abra, Dan, and company to face off against the True Knot, he pulled so many punches that he was in negative punch territory by the time it was over. Not once did I feel like Abra and Dan were in any sort of trouble, and thatwas the first problem. It's hard to thrill people when you don't get a sense of peril, and it is an odd mark to make against King, who normally (and with glee) will inflict pain and suffering upon his protagonists in order to elicit emotion from the reader. Second, when it came time for Abra to truly interact with her main adversary (Rose), King more or less pulls her out of the story, placing her halfway across the country from Abra while she sends her surrogates after the girl.<br /><br />I tried to figure out why King would have made this decision, why he seemed to be avoiding conflict rather than running head-on into it like he typically does. I still have no good answers. If he was trying to make it so that Rose grew more and more furious with each loss suffered at Abra's hands so that when the two of them finally did have their showdown, it would be all the more perilous, he failed there too, dispatching the story's enemies with such ease that it was more of an anti-climax. Rose simply was not very scary at all to begin with, and all her power was sucked away by the time we reached the battleground. Abra was so strong that she had no one who could match her power. Everything about that climax felt tacked on. Everything rushed. It was almost like King couldn't wait to get this story done so he could move on to something more interesting. Maybe sequels just aren't his thing.<br /><br />And that's what this book feels like by the end, like the obligatory sort of thing people write because other people want it, not because the author really wanted to write it. I know King still has magic in him. He blew me away with Joyland and 11/22/63 remains a modern masterpiece for him. But this book, like the steam it features between its pages, is thin and ultimately forgettable.was the first problem.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|Loved it! Getting to watch the Netflix drama first really helped to bring this book to life. German does a great job and gave me real insight into how messed up our legal system really is!
B00EARP0HM|4.0|There are a lot of plot holes, still you can't expect too much from a comic series this old.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a heads-up on the future Thanos movie. I do hope they use this plot, although the scope seems too grandiose for a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it, cheers
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I figured it out very early on and the author went on and on about things that did not need to be in the story!  I did not care for this book.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!! IT HAS THE BEST OPENING SEQUENCE AND SOUND OF ANY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game but lots of advertising comes with it. Tastes scores, easy to play and fun. You will enjoy this!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a memo pad with some features. A calendar, choice of selecting different colors for different notes, a to-do list. It's more than a simple notepad. This app is a favorite of my mine. And I have it on my phone, too.
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|Great physics based concept....however it drives me nuts when there is no exit option to end the game...hate having to hit the home button then force close it to end the game....also,a scoring system would be nice too...fix all this, and a five star.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Too long and drawn out...boring.  Too technical, historical, etc.  Her previous books were rather drawn out too, but this one was extreme and I quit reading it halfway through.  I may never finish it with so many other great books I can still read.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was boring, poorly paced, and a waste of time.  I don't know what I was expecting since I wasn't too impressed with the other two books.
B000001FK3|5.0|J J Cale's &#34;Naturally&#34; is one of the greatest rock n roll records of all time period. Up there with Thunder's &#34;So Alone&#34;, or Dylans &#34;Blonde on Blonde&#34;, except he makes his statement in a much more simple way. Punk rock has nothing on this guy, most of the songs are 3-4 chords max, and one song &#34;Clyde&#34; says all it has to say about music, neirghbors and blueswailing dogs with just TWO chords. Needless to say, the songs are catchy as h#ll, and will stay in your head after a listen.<br />The songs are deep, covering murder, heartache, drugs, and the life of a musician. Chances are you have heard someone else cover some of these songs ( eg &#34;After Midnight&#34;, &#34;They Call Me the Breeze&#34;, &#34;Magnolia&#34; ), now go to the source. Cale's voice and guitar playing ( on his famous &#34;home-made&#34; ) are outstanding.<br />By the way, my usual cup of tea as far as rock goes are bands like Redd Kross, Throwing Muses, with lots of Stoner Rock like Witch and Baby Woodrose thrown in. This rocks my world as much as any of those. Check it out! And remember to turn it up..By the way, I much prefer the low-tech engineering of this, kind of like &#34;Big PinK&#34;. I don't like his polished stuff as much, though it's still strong.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|it was very good. very similar to the fifty shades of gray. reminded a lot of that book. lisa t
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So much sadness can come in this world. What a treat to see someone look at it with such firmness and lack of sentimentality. I've lost someone I loved very much and this book helped me to cherish the time we had together in a new way.
0064431622|5.0|Son loves this book, he has autism and reads it to me every night. It's made for small kids 6 and under. They are very cute!
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|Great action flick!  Longer than I expected but the story is good.  I would agree with another person's assessment...think Godzilla meets Transformers and there you have it.
B000002NAK|5.0|Love the movie! The DVD was in excellent condition. The movie is a musical and not the cheesy kind. Easy to follow, a real tear jerker!

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Great album! Completely different feel from Recovery, but equally crafted. If you are a fan of his older, wilder material - this album will satisfy your needs.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|well written, well acted, compelling plot lines. Now that Boss is gone, House of Cards takes up the helm of gritty, sexy, political drama
B005COO1X6|3.0|I was honestly disappointed by this short story. It's just not up to the par that other stories by Stephen King. The story line was bery weak.
B000VZX8J4|4.0|one of my favorite albums growing up.<br /><br />i couldnt get into ultramega ok<br />or louder than love,<br />still have trouble with those<br />because i dont like the way they sound.<br />opinion i guess, they just dont move me,<br />BMF does. if you love rock,<br />doom metal, heavy rock etc..<br />this album really rocks hard. :)
1881273377|5.0|This  book has totally helped my husband and I ! Highly recommend! !!!! We listened to it almost a year ago and have noticed a huge change in the way we act towards each other and even work out problems.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What an excellent writer! I loved the perspective gained from reading this book. I will definitely read more she has written.
B0050X1OQ6|1.0|Doesn't work.  It's been a month, and I had to remove it since the configuration isn't exactly like the RAM that's already in there.  So it's not compatible.  I'm busy, and haven't had time to return it.  So I don't even know whether they'll take it back at this point.  I may be stuck with it now.  In the future, if I want to double my RAM, I'll know to buy the identical brand, make, and configuration as the existing RAM packet that is already in my laptop.
B000FA5STS|5.0|David Baldacci is one of the best authors! I have had the pleasure to indulge myself into the many realms of mystery which kept me on the edge during the entire book! My heart was racing as I could not stop reading the book. There were so many scenarios, it was impossible for me to figure out the conclusion. The conclusion was beyond surprising! I highly recommend it, you won't regret reading one of the b<br />est books I have ever read.
B006N57PXG|5.0|This is my third time reading this book. Love the characters and the wit!<br />Hoping for more to be released soon.
0061148512|1.0|Just couldn't get into it.  Too much descriptive filler-- kept hoping it would get better.  I was excited when I realized I finally reached the end of it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and especially appreciate that it only gives you 5 lives at a time Although that gets frustrating at times, it stops me from wasting my hours away each day!
B00G9U7R2O|2.0|honestly,while it doesn't work for adults or teenagers (as the original did quite well), maybe small children would find it of interest. the story line was weak and there was nothing new that was original content, let alone funny. best to find something else to watch.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Wasn't sure Ms. Gilbert could write outside her genre (memoir type), but she can! Rollicking good tale with an interesting point of view. Still not great literature...needed more dimension to the characters, but a real good read.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Was a great movie. Worth seeing. You'll get a glimpse of the south that you might not see otherwise. Lawrence is amazing in this film.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|This movie is about everything one despises.  Corruption, murder, mayhem, drugs, alcohol, carnage, and, a little bit of child porn.  How this turned into a great movie is beyond me.  I guess it is the acting, cinematography, music, unusual story line and wonderful character development.
B000SZK41M|4.0|I had never seen this before (I watched it in 2013). I can see why it is so popular. I am in my 20s and really enjoyed it. It is a great christmas movie.
B00AWIUJ60|5.0|So happy I found this! I bought it as a Birthday gift! He really enjoyed it and was surprised I found it too!
B000ZLJOW4|3.0|It was an interesting movie, but I don't get what all the cult-like hype is about. Was a little disappointed.
0765325950|5.0|Love the series, love the ending.  It could have been better in parts maybe, but I wad hooked after the first book.  Brandon would have had to really butcher it to ruin it for me at this point.
1932907009|2.0|Way way way too expensive for what you're actually paying for. Some information is very insightful, but not necessarily helpful. It was never really constructive.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|If you haven't read this yet, you are in for such an outstanding story... and if you are like me, sorrow, when you out read the author and have to wait for the story's conclusion.  It is so good you will be able to read it again before the last book is written I am sure.  I am envious that you get a chance to read this for the first time!
1401937268|5.0|Love these cards! I have many Doreen Virtue decks, but this one is special. I am so happy Doreen created A Tarot Deck with Radleigh Valentine!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not my type of reading. Read it because of the TV ravings for the movie.  Perfect for someone who wants to read a x-rated Cinderella type book series.
B000002GB9|5.0|This is an excellent Styx CD with great melodies and great sounds. I highly recommend it for old and new fans alike!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have been watching the series on TV and the books just provide so much more insight on the characters.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|This is a great Stevie Nicks CD. It has some nice music which is very enjoyable. I highly recommend it for old and new fans.
B00BOTCJXC|3.0|This promised much and staying the course of the five episodes, it was possible to get into the story.  However, while the two leads gave great performances, the third character in the trio, Ms Wallop was poorly developed and was not credible as the powerful love to move Cumberbatch's character.  The five episodes could have been reduced to 3 1/2 and it would have been much tighter period drama.  Much of the middle seemed to be make-work.  Also, it would have been better if the costumer had at least got things like uniforms right.  The old style of cuff ranks was only used until mid 1915, and the hat they forced Cumberbatch to wear was so ridiculous as to be a real distraction.
B000005ILF|5.0|This is an outstanding Sting CD, with great lyrics and also some great sounds. I highly recommend if for old and  new fans. You will love the music and the melodies.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Em is back on this one, the lyrics have me cracking up!  Alot of samples which just add to the stories Em spits, one of the better rap albums as of late.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|This is some great music for this movie. The soundtrack is a definite must have and contains some great music and melodies. I highly recommend it for fans!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is cool I'm on the hammerhead shark with a score 100000<br />I've had this game for a month now<br /> Be warned I'm the master<br />Also get this game trust.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Like both of these actors. Thought the movie was clever, well acted, and just<br />a good romantic comedy with some serious material also. Would recommend to others.
B00DUIBZSK|3.0|I think Selena has a beautiful voice but most of the songs on this album were ehhhhh.... boring!  There's a couple good songs but you can already hear them on the radio... overplayed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I choose this rating because Auggie's story is just a wonder. How he didn't want to go school but ended up being the most smartest and popular kid in the school, even though he was deformed.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game seems fun and flows nice. Can not wait to get further into it and see how it progresses through out the levels.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very addictive, fun and challenging game. Provides bursts of entertainment when you need to unwind for a moment. Really enjoy this game and would recommend anyone to buy it!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Best app I have ever used can't believe it worked so well have not ever had an app work well the first time this app made my day I'm grinning from ear to ear.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|It wasn't what I excepted. I wish there something they did different, but over all it wasn't bad. thank you
B00COCY67A|5.0|I like the information in the little booklet I received. I haven't listened to the cd,<br />but plan to this weekend.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It is cute and then you can look at it his fealings. Get this app it will be worth it.
B006DVUULE|5.0|Excellent movie ....great quality...good packaging and received the movie in a short period of time...would order another one sometime in the future...
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I like it because MacGyver comes up with ingenious solutions to various problems. Some seem like they have about a 20% chance of working, but they almost always work for him. There is little romance, no sex, just good old problem solving.
B0064W67IM|5.0|incredible read that cuts to the heart of dreaming and death as integral elements of life...a short cut to the human psyche set up dramatically and moved into with passion and eloquence!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|10 out of 10 album!! thanks Marshall!! every song is extremely well crafted, it shows how much work he put in it.<br /><br />I've been listening to it, ever since it came out, it's the only album on my iPod.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book, the one thing I think that could have made it better was if they actually did the Capitol Hunger Games
B008J8KBKY|4.0|If the rotation was a full in X and Y axes I would have given it 5 stars.<br />Having a limit in rotation makes it not as easy to ensure you haven't made a mistake.<br />Also doesn't work with my stylus.<br />Otherwise, excellent program.
B00138KE5Y|4.0|Love her voice! There's no one who can sing better than Babs and the pairs were perfect. I just wish there were more contemporary songs/artists.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far ok. Tutorial could be shorter. Nice graphics.  Not sure end game goal but interested in playing a little more.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|Described as &#34;brave&#34; in some quarters on account of its depiction of a lesbian relationship, THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT is actually a sharply observed domestic drama centering on the relationship between Jules and Nic (Julianne Moore, Annette Bening), their children (Mia Wasikowska, Josh Hutcherson), and their sperm donor Paul (Mark Ruffalo).  The film takes a long hard look at Paul's relationship to the family he never knew about - not until the children decide to get in touch with him - and how his desire to obtain a ready-made family is ultimately frustrated.  He turns out to be too self-centered to understand how others feel.  Likewise Nic finds out to her cost that, despite her privileged existence as a doctor, her loved ones need a little more time and space in which to grow than she is prepared to allow them.  Lisa Cholodenko's film never allows viewers any respite; her camera focuses in detail on each character's reaction to one another, as well as giving us an insight into their inner thoughts.  The cast are utterly convincing in their various roles, creating a taut drama whose sheer raw energy compensates for a rather anticlimactic ending.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of the best!!!  An absolute christmas classic!!!  This offers a color version as well as the black and white version which is my favorite!!!
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|Look, the movie is wonderful, do not let the negative reviews on here defer you away. This is an &#34;ORIGIN STORY&#34; of Superman.<br /><br />1. He is not Superman yet, in fact he is only call it once in the whole movie.<br />2. He does not have these &#34;morals&#34; that seem to belong to Superman in the comics and past movies.<br />3. Superman has killed General Zod several times in the comics.<br />4. He is trying to find his way in a world where he has no place.<br />5. He is developing his morals throughout the movie.<br />6. What choice did he have other than to kill Zod? Zod was genetically engineered to protect, and if need be restore Krypton to what it once was. He would have stopped at nothing to do that...and in the process destroy the human race, to bring Krypton back.<br />7. People do not listen to the dialogue in the movie...listen carefully and you will understand why Kal-El did what he did and how his powers work when you think they shouldn't.<br />8. People always compare to previous movies and TV shows when a remake comes out. It is not the 70's anymore where Superman floats around Metropolis with Lois to sappy music and terrible effects. It is the 21st century where people, well at least me want to see something more believable than that.<br />9. Just because he puts on the suit doesn't mean he all of a sudden is the savior of the world, the doer of no wrong, the ideal person, every mothers perfect child, that doesn't kill and steal...he is trying to find his way and discover those things on his own.<br />10. At the end of the movie he is Superman. Not during. He is a young man learning by his actions. He is doing before thinking.<br />11.&#34;Superman wasn't funny enough.&#34; Well sorry I forgot he was supposed to go around cracking jokes while his people come to kill the entire race of people he has lived with his entire life.<br /><br />Finally, the destruction...If Kryptonians were real they would be gods to us. Zod was terraforming Earthinto the new Krypton, he is not going to as kindly for every human to evacuate Earth so he can form it to a new Krypton. He will kill anything and anyone that stands in his way. This is not the Avengers where an Alien race comes from space with the purpose to kill the human race and ends up blowing up tons of cars and destroying one building in the process. And where the Hulk is a 600 pound monster with indefinable strength that can barely put a dent in a concrete building.<br /><br />I understand I am ranting, it is just to many people did not look deeper into this movie.<br /><br />This movie was superb. And deserves better than what it got.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|I enjoyed Stephen's recount of his ups and downs in life. A writer myself, I found it interesting how he started writing and how he effortlessly painted words on paper to let us peek into his childhood.  I have never been a horror reader nor do I plan on it any time soon but I don't live under a rock and I have seen many of his movies ('seen' is subjective here because usually my hands were over my eyes).  It was interesting to get insight into his creative process.  If his other books read like this I can 100% see why he is as successful as he is.  I would have given it 5 stars but some of the language bothered me (which, I am sure he doesn't care about ha), but all in all I enjoyed this and couldn't put it down.
B00F2362IE|2.0|I read majority of the reviews on here before buying the game for my son and although some were bad I got it anyway because he was excited about it . Although it is easy for him to play and he liked it and still asks to play it I took it off his Kindle. To start I had to remove almost all other apps movies and books off the kindle to even download it to the kindle. Then after he plays for a few minutes it freezes the whole kindle u cant even get out of the screen and I have to restart the kindle by holding the power button for 10 to 20sec. By that time my sons upset and doesn't understand why its stuck and he cant play. so it turns from being fun to being frustrating.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good price, performs well and I appreciate the mobility of it.  Works well for me especially on my otherwise unused Tv.
B003MC5N28|5.0|One of my Favorite books, I can re-read it over and over again. The only word that comes to mind is amazing.
B00ET2ODTE|3.0|Linda Lovelace is perhaps the most recognized name in the adult entertainment industry. As an entertainer her career was short lived and boring. She happened into history and the industry at the right moment. Her sword swallowing technique has lead to many couple arguments and divorces as she has raised the bar, sort of speak. This film looks shortly at her naive youth, although she had a baby out of wedlock. It hits upon her most famous film, and glosses over how film went main stream and the problem with authorities. The film was supposed to show how she was abused by her husband (Peter Sarsgaard) but lacks being graphic in the details as if to say, &#34;Go read the book&#34; or &#34;You know the story.&#34;<br /><br />The nurse in the film &#34;Deep Throat&#34; was played by fawn looking Carol Connors who was a blond and not the hardcore looking silicon star Nicole Andrews. They could have at least tried for Carol Connors' fans. The film misses on a lot of cylinders, not knowing what direction it needed to take.<br /><br />Perv Guide: F-bomb, sex, off screen rape, nudity (Amanda Seyfried)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is a great game for when I don't feel like reading.  It is a nice peaceful stress reliever, although I never seem to win.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that this game is very good in helping you stay focus. I really like this game it keeps me company.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Most excellent. I can't do without it. I am a jogger and  I use it to fasten my LED flashlight to my 2&#34; reflective belt.<br /><br />I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:<br /><br />Beware! Some &#34;reviewers&#34; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to or because they sell competitive products.

B00ENYCQX8|4.0|Great for ebooks not purchased through Amazon. Just what I needed to sort and read my tons of ebooks. It does at times give wrong percentage read data and I can't seem to find how to edit books without deleting them but other than that it works.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|This author is so full of horse feathers! Would you like to read an exceptionally great book instead?

006202406X|2.0|Two stars for including Four's point of view, because as much as I love Tris, I enjoyed getting in his head.<br /><br />Otherwise, terrible. As other readers, I felt extremely unsatisfied with the ending, largely because... [spoils ahead]<br /><br />[SPOILERS, REALLY]<br /><br />I wasn't sad that Tris died. I grew very attached to her, sure, and loved her probably more than I liked any other YA protagonist because she gets on my nerves a lot less and is actually smart, so obviously I was upset, but not that she DIED. That was something I saw as unavoidable. I was upset that she died after surviving an assassination attempt, bullet wounds, an execution (which she would have survived even without Peter's help), and supposedly unstoppable death serum. She was killed by an incredibly insignificant and forgettable villain, if you can even call him that. If I was supposed to see him as a sort of 'puppet master,' that massively failed. She conquered such an incredible and well built-up foe in Jeanine and her followers that to be killed in this way feels like a waste to the point that it's almost offensive that I'm expected to believe she died this way. She died 'saving' people from something that ultimately means less than anything she did while inside the city. Nobody deserves to forget their loved ones, I'm on board with that - but it just felt so meaningless by comparison. She didn't at any point seem to have even one fraction of the passion she had to avenge the Abnegation when she was trying to stop the reset. Just...a mess.<br /><br />Overall, though, I hated the plot line of this whole thing being related to genetic damage, and wish they had found something other than the plain ol' USA outside the fence (discriminating now based upon not skin color or sexual orientation, but genetic composition).<br /><br />The only thing about this I think was well done was Four's reaction to Tris's death. His reunion with his mother? Please. I wish Roth would have written this, scrapped it, and started over. I wouldn't have minded waiting for something that gave these characters (ESPECIALLY Tris) a worthy farewell.

B00DYEN5QU|1.0|Great Movie! But DO NOT GET ANYTHING ULTRAVIOLET! UltraViolet is a rip-off riddled with errors, playback problems, and it is not compatible across devices as much as they make it seem. This studio should be punished for not offering an iTunes version of the Digital Copy. If you're thinking of getting this movie into your iTunes collection as well as a 3D Blu-Ray all for one low price, think again. You will either have to do without a digital copy, or you will have to buy it again in iTunes. Pick which is more important to you from the Disc or the Digital Copy, unless you're willing to buy it twice.
1412960991|4.0|This is an academic must read, as part of any qualitative researcher's training to conduct &#34;Case Study Research.&#34; It will further explain how to design case studies after they have been discussed by professors in the classroom. While in the field, an academic researcher may want to have a copy of this book as a quick reminder/reference since the book is in a standard 6&#34;x9&#34; size and, barely 3/4&#34; thick. At minimum, It is good supplemental reading for the qualitative researcher.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I sharpen tools as part of my job, and regularly do sharpening in the field while I'm clearing brush. This tool worked great at first, until I realized I was only using the rod sharpener. Some knives went through the angled sharpeners and came out sharper and some didn't. After a few days in my pocket, the rod came off the sharpener. It may be cheap, but the construction was cheaper. Might be ok for very light use, or use in the home.
