B000MITKOM|5|Works great. People should remember to install hoses leaving a quarter inch before bottoming out on the tube so they can get the pliers in position to easily remove the hose.
B000C94HIK|1|I'm guessing this sensor works fine ... But the rating is because amazon told me this would work for my 2007 Hyundai Elantra . And it didn't ... Thanks Amazon
B00DBEO44A|5|These lights are exactly what I've wanted. Bright white and plenty of lighting.
B000U0Z2L2|1|This would be a decent three way power splitter. I like that the outlets are each on their own cable, instead of one large, rigid unit taking up a ton of space.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is one problem: it won't actually plug into my car's power port. The metal side contacts are too far back, so it just falls out. I've compared it to other plugs, and they all have the side contacts about a quarter to a half inch closer to the tip.<br /><br />If you need something like this, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
B00MS97ZYK|3|Customer service is a +++. Product is great.  Need better led's tho. Mine started blinking after 2 days.
B001TID59A|5|Great product. Easy to install if you have a few tools. They look good and don't make much noise. I would buy these again.
B00144ASEO|5|Excellent
B00JJ5H5VE|5|Fit perfectly on my 31.5 tire, looks much better than the plain &#34;Eddie Bauer&#34; regular tan one that came with my bronco. I would recommend it to anyone that has a two tone Bronco with a tan roof.
B000C0YP6I|5|Perfect stock fit. No leaks. And I don't think I had to trim it either. Replaced for preventative maintenance when flushing the cooling system.
B0082365AQ|2|I can't seem to keep it on kayak... the tethering system is not good, and I may try other cargo straps.... it may be good if you are only carrying on flat beaches, but our area has slopes and some are even rocky.... enough said.
B004J0V2V8|5|Fits perfect speedy delivery
B00COYNZJ8|5|Love it
B006X8AHP6|4|The finish was perfect and it fit pretty good the bottom mounting holes did not line up with the bottom of the grill but it still fit and looks good
B00ABYVT64|4|These work to spray bleach around my bathroom. I'll note that the pick-up tube inside the bottle is about 2&#34; too long and requires trimming.<br /><br />You can hear a check-ball rattling in the sprayer. They will not spray at a slight angle (over 22degrees), even when the tube is submerged. I notice this as I am bent like a pretzel trying to spray bleach around my tub and shower enclosure without getting it on my clothes (I know, join the &#34;clean naked&#34; party).<br /><br />I've had 50% bleach in a sprayer for a week and it still sprays.  My bottles arrived clear. They are type1 PETE plastic. The three bottles were shrink-wrapped together in plastic (frustration-free).
B0009IQXM2|5|amazed at the results. just sprayed on, let it sit for 15 sec, and sprayed off with water. ALSO WORKED ON MY CHROME MIRRORS CHROME DOOR HANDLES. I was worried at first thinking it might damage the paint next to the door handles but it didn't. It ALSO CLEANED OFF MY RINO LINER THAT WAS STAINED REDDISH FROM A FEW LOADS OF RED BARK that I used for some ground cover. truly amazing product. and no scrubbing needed. I had previously tried washing the bed with soap and a power washer and it didn't work. this is the best product ever.<br />However, it is a small bottle and can get expensive. I know meguiars make another product like this that is sold in gallon containers. anyone know what it called?
B00449HHMW|4|Compared to the rusty old hose it replaced, this thing is great.  Fit perfectly.  I feel a lot better about the brakes in my 14-year-old car after replacing these and all of the rusty steel tubing.
B00BQE5HUW|4|All the light bulbs worked fine. No problems with the negative or positive wires or anything like that. The only true issue is that they are not as bright as you would probably expect them to be.
B003P55E2Q|5|A+
B004AGFPR8|5|these puppies have zero lateral runout (I used a gauge). Some brand new are between .06 and .08 of variance which I could quickly feel (steering wheel vibrations) after a few thousand miles. They are also balanced. Top quality. Avoid the vented/slotted brakes as those can collect chucks of brake pads.
B00PHOEKSM|5|Great product for a great price. Does exactly what it's supposed to.
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B002HXQBM4|4|Easy to put on with clips but seems a little flimsy to as rigid as I would have thought.
B00E6V8CRW|2|bought 3 only one worked  No electrical connection internally
B0082365AQ|5|Simple solution to transporting your kayak from your vehicle to the launch site.  Sometimes you just want to head out alone and enjoy a day of kayaking or fishing. But you don't need anyone to help with the TMS Cart.  Collapses to store in your vehicle and a snap to secure to your kayak or canoe.  Check out on YouTube.
B000CJ71ZG|5|Fit great on my 03 gmc sierra 2500hd. In a horrible spot tho. Much better deal then local stores.
B0002KNVPE|5|worked like it should
B000C8P8WK|5|100% satisfied!( And cheaper than part store wanted!  yay!) the whole experience for me went way smoother than I thought it was going to..was correct part,delivered on time,easy as heck to order from👍 I say yes!
B00BNDC3HQ|2|The splash guards were for a 2012, They would not fit a 2014
B00A82A3QG|5|Fast delivery. Exactly what I expected. Five stars
B00DQW31DM|4|I had to trim it a little but it's quality.
B00CWFZ4HU|5|Plugs right in.........after you locate the vehicle plugs. Don't depend on the locations given, except under the dash. On my 2014 Ram they were clear up against the front of the dash.
B003YCINNM|5|perfect cheap gym towel.  just what i was looking for!
B000BRFS8Q|5|Performed as advertised.
B002VVFZWE|5|Great replacement fuel filter for my ktm exc 500
B00P7G82TS|4|Very pleased. Had a custom mount made for my ML350.
B007VR7PMQ|5|Perfect fit
B000JFES40|4|The lens doesn't snap on too tight but it hasn't fallen off in transit yet.
B001DBTTSO|4|Installed these on my FJ to allow the suspension to be back into caster after installing a 3&#34; lift.  Happy with the product and the truck rides better, less tracking when driving over uneven surfaces/ruts in pavement.<br /><br />The only downside is since the ball joints are adjustable, it can be tough to find a shop that someone with experience with them. Most shops won't touch them or will have trouble properly aligning the vehicle with the adjustable ball joints.  If you are lucky enough to have 4x4 shops near you, this probably won't be an issue.
B0055EMN7Y|5|Good quality
B00BAZBYTU|3|This fit my Nissan Sentra fine.  It performs rather poorly, but is a vast improvement over the lack of antenna I've had since my wife busted it off on the garage door.
B00NHIHLQS|4|I was pleased with the promptness of delivery and the product.  It works as advertised.  Bright LED's anywhere you want light.
B00PARQUG6|5|Worked great fit good
B009DJ3466|5|Seems to do the job.
B001TNX0IQ|5|Smells great!
B0017ICQLK|1|not waterproof, not even water resistant-- bike was soaking wet underneath this cover after it rained for just 10 minutes. Indeed the material itself was wet through.  on re-reading the product description, it conspicuously avoids words like &#34;waterproof&#34;, &#34;rainproof&#34; &#34;showerproof&#34; and says instead  &#34;protects motorcycle against weather&#34;.  well, that weather might be a light breeze or some high clouds, but in my experience, that weather would not be rain...
B00B1CLZGO|1|I had the cover for the bucket seat version previous and it is a great product.  However, the bench seat version is NOT a good design.  The Velcro strip that attaches to the top of the cover to go around the headrests will not stay attached.  Just a bad design.  I think it would be better to have it sewed on each end and some in the middle & leave slits for the headrests.  I sent it back and will look for another cover.
B000C4E09G|5|I'm only giving this five stars to offset the negative reviews. Its a fuel pump, no big deal, the big deal is this pump specifically DOES NOT come with the fuel pressure regulator. Please, get the AIRTEX FTPS2 pressure sender. I know, you're the best shadetree mechanic ever and you won't waste your money, but just buy it, here's why:<br />• The old one is broken already, that regulator, coupled with a bad check valve is why your Ranger is running like crap<br />• even if it is still functional, it's going to crack on its way out<br />• even if its still functional and you're the master of removing plastic gubbins without it crumbling, it WILL NOT mate up/seal in the new top.<br />Save yourself from the aggravation I encountered, just have it. If you do successfully swap it, and it seals, and you're satisfied, send it back. but its better to have it instead of being behind the 8 ball
B005BNZ9UM|1|We purchased 3 sets to place under jacks is 40' fifth wheel parked on concrete so that we would not gets stains.  The pads are not a year old and have warped.  Not at all happy for the price we paod
B002NOGIT8|5|WOW!!!!!
B000ONZXPK|2|Got here fast but I ordered 4 and 2 of them were leaking all over the box. One of them was half empty with the cap loose.
B00BUS3AKS|5|wife loves this.
B00062Z6QK|4|This is a capaliary tube gauge and I needed a sending unit gauge. I did not read the description well. I returned it without problem and ordered a ford factory match stepper motor electronic that worked well on my F-250 diesel.
B000NZOH7E|3|Works fine for my 2000 4 runner. Basic but looks fine.
B00HI4ZUQ0|1|It was not what I was looking for at all!!!
B00GVHFCMW|3|Works as advertised but gave lower rating as company did not honor the gift card included in the package.
B002P35N7A|4|ok
B005CLMRVW|5|Works and fits like it is suppose to.
B009OBVXDO|5|Efficient and quality = value
B0039SOMUE|5|To the door and cheaper. Good deal
B000E347LQ|5|Arrived promptly, fit perfectly, works well.
B0067ULKE2|5|Direct fit.
B00A14PZ7S|2|They gave a nice sound until they fell off the exhaust during motion even though they were screwed on very tight.
B00NS6ZEKO|5|Right fit to my 2008 Toyota 4Runner. Smooth ride.
B0001EXP9S|5|Fit real good.  No need to cut or adjust perfect fit.  Easy to install. Looks great too!

B00E1SJ35K|5|Fast shipping high quality
B0027EAC7S|5|Birthday gift for my son.  Perfect fit!
B000TYVW8G|4|worked great
B0058V9CF0|5|As long as you don't mind maybe 15 minutes of labor, you can save about $100 over those custom fit mats out there! I am an electrician and this works great for carrying my dusty tools around each day, and protects my trunk from damage. Love it!
B00BNRQRF6|3|ITS OKAY BUT ITS TOO BIG
B0028P2TZ4|5|Great product. Great value!!
B00H36XX6C|4|This is great little device which combines portable device charging with a surprisingly powerful flashlight.<br /><br />It's fairly light but seems rugged. It's rubberized and all ports are covered when not in use. The description says it's dust and water resistant. This is not waterproof. but I guess it will protect from rain or casual spillage.<br /><br />The small form-factor is easy to cram into a glove box or daypack. You could even stick it in your pocket.
B003CJXRQU|4|I've used these footpegs before, so was familiar with how to mount them, sorta.  The instructions, which were almost useless, specified that the gold spring had to go on the right peg, the silver spring on the left.  So, I kept trying to mount the pegs that way.  Only they wouldn't (the springs allow the pegs to return to the riding position after they get hit and knocked into the 'retracted' position).  Finally, after finding some more detailed information on-line, I reversed the side the springs were supposed to mount on and, wonder of wonders, that worked.  Should have been a 15-20 job, took over an hour, all because of bum instructions.  The pegs themselves are very good, I like them because they give a better riding platform than the stock BMW R 1200GS pegs, more comfortable.  The pegs are well made and worth the buck.  Now about those crappy instructions . . . . . . . . . . .
B00DM8NBW6|1|Sorry ass product
B00C88B8J4|4|Good
B00QN62V0M|2|Don't store anything of importance up there. I only lost my shoes when the zipper came open. Also inside liner did not hold up well and came off. No longer water resistant. I'd pass on this product if I had a do over.
B002PYBZJO|2|Compatibility claims much exaggerated, specifically OBD wiz setup/ software'<br />I had to buy another, which enabled me to connect to OBD2 GMC Safari<br /> I ordered it last year, fooled around, never got around to it<br />until just recently, so it's partly/mostly my own fault, too late to return.<br />The part that works, seems to work pretty good, the delivered-to-the-door part<br />worked pretty good, as scheduled. I was eventually able to accomplish what I wanted,<br />but, it ended up costing  X2 plus, to  do so.<br />UPDATE, Couple seasons later, These folks saw my review, went to considerable effort to make me satisfied, which they did.<br />I feel I should point that out, as, that counts.  Thanks JR
B00NIHI5Y0|4|Nice.
B00BYH6C1E|5|they work great!  A bit hard to get into place but that is why they work so well. They fill the gap!
B005VFWOOE|4|looks geat on window its a lil tricky putting it on gota realy pay attention and be in mood to put it on window looks great though
B0001UZUW2|5|I upgraded the string on it and made it longer, works really well!
B005278RJM|5|Use this and never have a battery run down. Easy to install and use...
B00RXFPAAK|5|This part fixed the rear A/C unit in a 2003 Honda Pilot I had recently purchased.<br />The rear A/C seemed to have no power at all, and rather than troubleshooting the vehicle itself I researched online and found this to be a relatively common issue among higher mileage Honda/Acura SUVs with rear A/C units, so I ordered this replacement based solely on the symptoms observed and the solution reported by other owners (lazy man's &#34;diagnostic&#34; process). Installation was simple and the rear A/C unit immediately began working (whew). My kids and pets are much more comfortable now. :-)<br /><br />***Removal Process*** (no tools needed)<br />1. (see first attached pic) Move the driver's seat all the way back and pry off the access panel located along the bottom of center console on the driver's side. There are seven snap-in retaining Clips and two Tabs to release. You'll need to bend the access panel into a 'C' shape to release the front Tab and rear Clip.<br />2. (see second attached pic) Examine the air intake screen forward of where the transistor is installed and clean if needed (dust clogging the intake will cause the blower motor to work much harder than normal -- requiring excessive power draw and potentially causing these resistors to fail prematurely). Disconnect the power wires from the existing transistor by depressing the locking Clip on the connector while pulling the connector away. Remove the existing transistor from the vehicle by depressing the locking Clip on the housing while rotating the transistor clockwise until the two notches on the transistor are aligned with the two retaining Tabs on the vehicle housing, then sliding the transistor out.<br /><br />***Reinstallation Process*** (no tools needed)<br />1. Align transistor locking Tab pointed downward and slide fully into vehicle housing, ensuring that notches on transistor pass over retaining Tabs on vehicle housing.  Rotate transistor counter-clockwise until transistor locking Tab passes vehicle housing retaining Clip.  Align power connector with locking Clip pointed downward and attach by pressing firmly (a 'click' should be audible as locking Clip is secured).<br />2. Insert front Tab of access panel into slot on vehicle firewall. Bend access panel into a 'C' shape to position rear portion between driver's seat and center console. Insert upper Tab of access panel (top center) into corresponding slot on center console then firmly press on access panel at each of the seven retaining Clip points to secure them (don't forget rear-most Clip, hidden by driver's seat).
B0021YZER2|1|Joke!  Didn't take off water spots
B000ALDROU|5|I cant beleve i waited so long to fix this problum,It was a snap and a screw and your thru.i never realized how heavy the hatch is on a grand cherokee,i replaced both with strong arm 4857s works great dont have to use an old golf club,and a whole lot safer.Getting one arm wont work,i tried it.
B003YLMPPA|5|This installed fine, and fixed the blower control in out 2004 Jeep Liberty.  I can't attest to its durability, but it seems just as robust as the factory part.
B002PQJ9A4|5|fit perfectly on my '90 4Runner. almost identical to stock assembly , no adjustments needed
B000GU36KA|5|I received a kit years ago as a gift & it's been a lifesaver.  My boyfriend was installing a new exhaust on my VRod but didn't have his tools with him.  I handed him this kit & he thought it was awesome.  Buying one now on Amazon for my boyfriend as he has a VRod too.  He'll  keep these tools handy in his bike bag in case of emergencies.
B00Y13WAMS|5|Shipped on time. Thanks. Good product. Good price.
B00KN0UOEE|5|This was recommended for our softub.  It works great and will continue to protect it several times a year.
B002KNM7ZQ|5|well made
B007QBVS3O|5|Fast delivery good product and price
B010HPB6JG|1|Product is worth about $20. Plenty more to choose from
B00548YPLS|5|Grips are like pillows compared to other grips. Worth the money, easy to put on and haven't had any issues!
B00QILWRZQ|5|great for my other bike, Susuki GS650 GL
B001F72Y5G|5|well, worked on first trip.  light weight.  easy to handle.  seems sturdy.  if the camper started to shift, I would hope that they would hold...  don't really know that.
B008S9LGAS|5|Good way for Solar wire splitters
B00AZ4U43Y|1|Cheap, bad fit, goto auozone
B010CUCXZM|5|Easy to install and looks great thanks
B00D8DR0AO|5|Awesome car wash, drought in SoCal right now and it's great for my car washing business on my street.
B0095D34YM|1|I received the package open and without a grommet.  It did fit my 2004 BMW 330ci e-46, but the pump is very weak. water barely reaches the windshield.  I would have returned it for a refund but don't want to take the pump out again. I'll buy an OEM next time. DON'T BUT THIS PUMP.
B000C933ZI|5|Stops great, no noise, very little brake dust.  I am well pleased!
B001AWD6LW|5|Great fit for my 1991 Jeep YJ.  Have not tried it in the rain but fits and looks worthy of the price.
B00B8BBWDE|5|Great!
B0010DN08K|5|Yeah, go with new ones if you can. Refurbished ones don't  come out as good. Price much cheaper than from auto parts store !!
B010BT4XSY|2|Product is as expected. The down side is the mount makes the antenna rub on the tire. So if your plannin to put a spring mount on this set up it will not work except sideways movement. Also the mounting on the spare tire carrier will need spacers otherwise there is a lip on the spare tire carrier and will make the antenna stick towards the rear further. I decided to make my own mount off the third brake light with some angle iron from a hardware store as i am using a firestick and spring adaptor.
B00IITSC3C|4|They work great but i noticed they do make some noise when slowly song
B00332GPNS|4|One of the visors broke upon installation which was replaced by Amazon. Otherwise they seem to be nice visors.
B00CZBQCR2|5|I only installed on one door, It works pretty good, no complaints.
B00D450U1M|5|Mixed my pearls, smooth coats on, no issues. You'll never go wrong when using Performix products
B00NDJ6YDW|5|Love these Vent Window Shades, Fit perfect for my car...Thanks
B00MB8D7PO|1|The details are found to be broken
B00CI1VV34|5|Excellent!
B00GUSKOP2|5|Bought these for my boyfriend for his truck. True to size. He loved them!!
B009EKWIU2|5|Fits just like OEM - good price.
B00HPXK8E8|1|Too short.  Poor quality.  Was hoping for something much better.
B000NWA8HU|5|Works very well....fit right in no problems....have had it in for some time now and all is well......works like a charm.....
B00FIO6CUK|4|Works good only problems I had was that it blinked at a different times then the front lights and continued to tick after the signal was shut off nothing that stops it from working though
B00B9ZJT7A|4|Look really good
B00LNNR9GG|5|These are awesome. They match my TruckLite headlights almost perfectly. Gives a totally different look than stock. 08 JK Unlimited Rubicon
B00MC79TLA|4|One of the bulbs parking light died after 2 days. I'll update the review after I get a replacement. Let's see how this is handled  Update-Got the new set of bulbs and everything works well. The look great.  08 JK Rubicon Unlimited
B00192JGY4|5|Wish I bought this a long time ago, absolutely love it!
B0087NB1IW|5|If you don't think it's loud enough you are already going deaf. The bass is not for these speakers and no matter where you mount the mic I've been told I'm still clear. Battery life is good I guess I charge mine every few days or so. Love it!
B0006O7LWK|2|the plastic mount has sharp ends that will end up cutting the rubber unless lubricated which ends up being a hastle<br />i ended up sanding and polishing the ends to allow it to slip in without cutting into the rubber took me some  elbow grease to make it look professional but in the end its prefect<br />the pump it self works well<br />when i got the product it was covered in white residue from sitting for so long
B00SH33Y00|1|These are terrible.  They don't fit properly (yes, they are the correct ones for my vehicle).  He connections are not good and keep going in and out.
B00429NKWK|5|This is the second kit I bought for my brother in law. Works perfectly when you follow the directions. I researched quite a bit before buying this the first time.
B003VAY63S|5|Item was as described, shipped quickly, arrived with no issues.I will definitely use this seller again!
B00T6FPC76|5|Really easy to assemble and looks real good, plus the price can't be beat. Material looks and feels high quality.
B000EDQR50|5|As advertised and easy to install in original screw holes.
B007HRGTJA|3|This fit like a glove on the tank side. That was the only thing that went perfect. The outer hose is very soft, thus I suppose that was a good thing because the fit is on the edge of being too long. The other end, where you put the pump, the pre-drilled screw holes do not line for all 3. And it was hard getting just 2 to line up. The original neck came with a sleeve that fit on the tank side, this one did not come with that sleeve so I ended up using the original.<br />In short, I am thankful for this seller offering this product. For the price it is great! Just plan on a little DIY effort to finalize your install.<br />Hope this helps,<br />RedR
B00VC6H6A8|5|It looks really good, fast delivery
B00BUN5R1S|5|Perfect fit for 06 murano. Ended the dreaded tire drone. Seems like a quality part, but only time will truly tell
B0062V2VIK|4|The racks were fairly easy to install with one person. I do notice a whistling noise at 30-45 mph but it is a minor issue. Overall great product.
B00D7N8HRK|5|a+
B001PWA0IO|3|A really great idea and I do like it.  However, after about a month, the ball on the bed came loose and fell out surprising me when I lowered the tailgate.  In fairness to the company that made the unit, they made it clear that you only turn the screw so many times (I believe it was 12 or 13 times).  I followed directions to the tee, I thought based on the importance on other reviews and instructions.  I was able to repair the break but I just can't believe there aren't another device to use instead of what was used in this device.
B00XAX4B9A|5|Fits perfect for my 2000 and 2003 Nissan Maximas.  The quality so far seems great.  The price is also really good, as the reason why I bought two of them.
B00407YQ36|2|The color does not match well.
B008CE0R40|5|Do a good job holding fifth wheel in place on sloped driveway.
B00IALJ52U|2|Totally disappointed it lasted 6 months, and worst of all is that Amazon website show that it fit my vehicle 6 months later it shows that it did not fit.  Try the warranty but there is no way to contact the company. Stay away from Moog!!
B002FUR29A|5|I can definitely tell a difference in hp and sound!!!<br />Pretty much easy 45-1h work.
B00PI3R6IS|5|My wife loved them. So I'm happy for that.  Great accessories!!!!!!!
B002VI2YG2|5|Work great
B00MZLTCBU|5|Awesome awesome awesome! Came quickly and exactly as pictured
B0019I9SV4|5|Fit my sons Honda correctly, no issues
B00ELNATDA|5|It's a bit larger than I had anticipated, but it's exactly as it was described
B0048EBVMA|4|fits ok. curved part for the guage cluster could be better. needs more velcro
B00MJSQHJE|5|Exact fit
B00QHUFUU2|5|smooth, quiet operation great fit great price
B00594KQ06|3|Leather itself is amazing.<br />But mine got a seam open so i return.
B003DUFCGQ|5|Great product. Easy installation
B001LQJWK6|4|Nice plate holder for my mustang GT
B00BSY719A|5|This is the tool you need to get the clutch off
B00NPQUYM0|5|Great light for ATV. Easy to install and provides a nice white light for low lighting situations at dusk or dark. Easy install. Mounted this light on the front of my ATV to switched light wiring. Also waterproof.
B004A73MQI|5|I got this because our 2008 Honda Odyssey check engine light was showing a  P0154 - O2 Sensor Circuit No Activity Detected Bank 2 Sensor 1.  I picked up two since we were above 110k and I figured it wouldn't be much longer for the other one to fail.  This particular code means the front set of sensors (upstream), not the O2 sensors further down, closer to the catalytic converter.  These (the upstream sensors) have an O2 sensor plus an Air/Fuel sensor so it's more expensive.<br /><br />The old sensors were NTK as well, and look pretty much identical.  Removed with a 7/8 O2 socket, and installed with the new one with the same.  It went on easily with the anti-sieze stuff on the threads, plugged in and after disconnecting and reconnecting the battery the check engine light is gone and it runs fine.  What more could I want?
B00LORW9J8|4|Awesome.
B00768DDC6|5|great
B000COXNXK|4|just what I need
B008AZA4C6|5|It does look great on my bike!
B004K0DIIM|3|Good set up not as easy to bolt as shown in videos with the bolts that are provided recommend using your own bolts one of them snapped very esily.sometimes the switches wiggle loose and won't turn off for some reason.
B00X9HW8CY|5|Had to replace some automotive air conditioning valve stems that were leaking on an early 2000's Honda Accord and needed to ensure I got a tool that could open both types of Schrader valves on our car (2 different sizes) and this tool worked perfectly.  There were other reviews either here or elsewhere saying the barrel had to be smoothed down to fit in or something, but at least for automotive use and the one I received, it worked perfectly.
B013WZ13E6|5|We have been looking for something like this for our Chevy Traverse.We have things like discount coupon books and emergency kits we like to have handy in he vehicle but don't want them to fly around the back.  This installed VERY easily.  It held all of our stuff easily with lots more room for travel etc. I love that it just installs simply but could also be taken out if we had to drop the seat and didn't want that on there.  The netting itself and the seams etc on the sides are very sturdy and made out of quality materials.  I highly suggest this organizer because of ease of installation as well as the quality of the product all overall.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for an honest discount.
B000AS3D3S|1|Amazon &#34;Check Fit&#34; says that it fits my 2004 Ford Taurus. It does not fit at all. My Ford Taurus is SE with OHV engine. FRAM HM3600 fits my car.
B00T6MKG0W|5|I suspect that  these were for a regular sentra. ( non ser) I got it figured out and after installing  have no problems so far. Next time i will be a little more careful on fit.
B00Y1HUC5G|5|Great product!
B00HV4H3XK|5|I bought this for my friend. He loved it. It came beautifully boxed up as well.
B00CAX61MG|5|Very happy with product!!!
B00VIVGRS4|5|I dont know where else to put this. I see other people saying there is an instructoin book. I didnt get one. The flash light only lights on the center beam. I cant get it light on the 2 outer beams. Not sure if im doing something wrong. I will be testing the charger over the weekend.Otherwise seems like what I wanted
B00LTX7RPS|5|Excellent; The best  mats i've purchased even at that price$ 20; heavy as you would want it; it has ArmorAll written on where you're  stepping, means its their brand, a good one.  Recommended
B00I5HRTU4|5|Well built!
B000CQBFGU|3|The inside diameter was a bit small.  Had to grind inside a bit larger to fit the exhaust tube, but it worked fine after that.
B007TD1WIK|5|Packaged nicely, does the job and the cords are nice and thick to avoid tangles. Good purchase.
B00H40T9YM|2|would not stick and has broken tab i own the helemet pictured in the display  it is a fantastic idea just poor construction you would have to super glue it on to make it stick
B0018GP7SU|5|I had this installed in my 2009 Dodge Ram. From time to time, I walk out to my truck late at night just to start it and listen to the rumble. It's that good.
B005PZMKZI|4|Fit good  in my car
B00IS96WIE|3|Was really looking forward to this grill, but when I got it there were dents all along the top of it. Didn't want to spend time returning it so i still put it on my truck.
B000EBMLIY|1|I installed these, and the stitching broke immediately when I opened the door. Absolute trash.
B000KAZXHU|5|This fit the OEM connector on my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly!  As others have stated, you most likely will need to go to the dealership to have the vehicle &#34;flashed&#34; (service advisor's term) in order for the connector to work (have power flowing through the OEM wiring for lights, brake lights, and turn signals).  Basically, through UConnect, Chrysler will update your vehicle to have active trailer wiring - process takes approx. 30 minutes and usually costs $50.
B00NQUJ2Q4|5|Perfect  fit Bmw 2005 525i thanks Gates.
B00SCHSNGG|5|Exactly how it looks in the picture. Carry bag and lense cloth comes with it. Very happy with it. Waiting for the helmet to arrive.
B00B5048U2|5|Arrived sooner than expected. Fits perfectly. A little pricey, but Made In America makes it worth it to me!
B00W10XUP4|5|Love it! ! ! ! ! Igot the jeep grill ones and they look awesome. Even better at night. I was wonderfully suprised with how good the quality of the metal is. BUT, make sure oh you ststes rules about covering your tail lights.
B001QK1X5O|5|Didn't fit my trailer. Easy return process.
B0002SR5OO|5|Second one. Very time saving
B000NSBSNW|5|thanks
B00PP79NAQ|2|Was disappointed that these don't fit the factory bolts.
B00194F0CE|5|Does what it is supposed to do
B004XJ3R7C|5|perfect fit for Odessey 2014.
B000FUNZF2|5|It lasts much longer that conventional gun oil(it doesn't evaporate like conventional). It also stays on even when you fire 400rnds consecutively to the point where the gun is too warm to hold comfortably.<br />I don't know if it's the best gun oil, but it's my favorite so far.<br />It also works great as a bicycle chain lube!
B000CFQIO0|5|Quality intake, installed within 30 mins and came with paper directions
B0036R6IT6|2|Overpriced and not the best material, cheap latches
B004WMD8JW|4|It was the correct part.  We were able to pick up the tool required easily and at a reasonable cost.  It has been 2 weeks and still working well.  A friend and I installed it.
B000C01T3A|5|Great Rotors which I've used before on same vehicle. Even wear and minimized rust here in the Brutal Northeast after 3 years (Winters).
B00IESMAOO|5|Adorable - used heavy duty​ velcro command strips cut to size to attach to the dashboard of my new vehicle- works perfectly!
B00LUPOSD4|5|Panel tool removal tools worked perfect.  I was able to quickly remove the interior panels using a combination of one of the smaller tools and the large wide blade tool.  There was no scratching of paint or damage to interior features.  I am very happy with the results and I know these tools will come in handy for future jobs.
B000AME50Y|1|Does not work
B003CN1YRU|5|Looks great on my car.
B005CO9GX6|4|This vacuum pump worked great for vacuuming my A/C system before filling it.
B007GEETWS|4|Fit perfect.
B001ADFBVO|5|I did my research by going to the Du-ha website to find the exact part number for my vehicle. It fits like a glove. I just had my family in town for my wedding, and took them fishing. In my Du-Ha I fit a 20 gauge shotgun, 4 fishing poles, a small leather tote, straps, a pouch full of sockets and wrenches, my fishing vest,along with some other odds and ends. Fit just fine. It is sleek and conforms to the seat above. These items would be s pile of s mess or thrown in the back if not for my Du-Ha. Mine is in a 2011 Silverado crew cab 1500LT 4X4.
B00SK66BP4|5|Just what I needed. These mats are for my 3rd row Sorento. They fit perfectly and very easy to vacuum clean. They are made for thevehicle and replace the carpet mats that came with the car.
B00JGQM3DQ|5|Great product, easy pour....
B000C7S1FC|5|WORKED PERFECT, EXACT FIT.
B00475LKO4|5|Fit perfect on my 2010 Ford Mustang. Cute and sassy
B00QYPY92K|5|This Part worked on the first try. It didn't come in with the 30amp fuse required, it had a 15amp in it, but that was no big deal. Swapped it out, installed the part and has been working since. No more battery drain. Thanks guys.
B0002SRCMO|5|If you are working on cars that use these push lock fasteners this works a lot easier than a screwdriver or pliers. Also a lot less damage to the fastener. I was working on a Canam Commander side by side vehicle and the entire interior panel set is held together with these fasteners. This tool made the removal sequence take a few minutes.
B00029JKC8|5|Performed as expected.  This was a replacement for a gen 1 of the same system.
B00X5S0SNS|4|A little bulky. Build quality seems to be decent. (Tab to detent, where collar and body lock together, is a bit delicate).<br />Very bright. LEDs in general, don't illuminate so much as they are bright/blinding to look at (on comming traffic) which is where the issue is with so many of today's headlights.<br />Light beam is ok, not excellent but good for a retrofit.<br />Worth the money and delivery was quick.
B00J9OT8II|5|Great. Good seller. Thank you.
B0045WBVUM|5|More comfort than I expected! My but did not hurt.A worth while,functional purchase.
B004XNQLB2|5|I used this to cover some very small holes in the trailer awning. I'm hoping that the repair will be permanent - the tape will certainly keep the holes from getting bigger.
B004NV4E2W|5|Came in within a week great buy  ! Bolts not included but easy buy at a hardware store ..recommnd removing some washers on the middle Main bolt they make mirrors loose
B0015PKC5W|5|Very helpful tool! Its NOT worth damaging the axle seal when trying to install them without this tool or with makeshift tools. Good investment, solid tool that will be around for a long time to come.
B00IWQH64M|5|Everything was as expected
B00XZQ13NY|1|Broke 3 days after I got it. Doesn't stick well and hardens and breaks.
B00332YIM8|5|read the directions, looked at the youtube video and installed my light bar with no problems or issues.  Very rugged support for lights. Martes up with Jeep window support for bolting in and running wires for the lights.Does take two people to install the upper piece.  Leave the two lower pieces loose so you don't need to fight the alignment when mating upper and lower brackets, tighten lower brackets after all is assembled.  Great light support bar.
B000CIJ308|4|Outstanding product. Goes on smoothly and without a lot of mess. Not much overspray as the nozzle helps maintain a great accurate spray radius.
B00FS3CB6A|4|Good but a little hard to adjust but helped stabilze slides nicely. They help take a little off the load of the slides for longer than a day when camping.
B00BTJMWM0|5|Perfect color match, just be mindful of the humidity
B00B90PPGY|5|not using this for the truck it was designed for. putting this on my 1996 gmc suburban 4x4. nobody makes one for my truck so I got this one. looks like its going to be just about perfect.<br /><br />ok here are a few pictures of the install and yes the template is off and yes the front stud is smaller. do not know why. I also did not have a stud in my kit. its the same as the bolts that hold the pillar bracket on. I just got a bolt and cut it down and screwed in from the inside. you will need 3 1/2 hole saw and a tube of silicone. I used black. I trimmed the inner sheet metal with snips. i did need a heat gun for this. I am very happy with my purchaseand would buy again
B00WW0LIOS|2|if you buy the 24 inch its actually 21 inches so if you need specific measurements dont buy this product.
B00CFALFXY|5|Excellent, thick, absorbing microfiber clothes. The size is perfect. I use the yellow and green ones for dish washing and around the kitchen. The blue is for cleaning bathrooms. Have yet to designate the pink ones :-).<br />WibraWipe sent the clothes quickly and they followed up by e-mail with useful tips. All around a great shopping experience - thank you!
B000PL06IU|5|Works well, but produces really fine dust.
B0068C5E50|5|I am loveing it it turns people head left and right loud and sound so good beast exhaust ever...
B0002UEOLO|4|Easy to use but will have to see over time how well it works.
B000AP57W6|5|easy to install. great item
B00EOFRGBS|4|It's great she really like it. Shipping was messed up but it's all good
B008OYMYEO|5|Easy install and great match
B000G72UOQ|3|Good value, but I was looking for a silvered mylar one and they sent a dull grey version - read the fine print: &#34;styles may vary&#34;.  I don't know WHY they should vary, as those are two different products.
B00X5FJFQC|1|No place to place battery.
B00N2BQRRY|3|didn't fit right, still fits on my front porch maybe I'll buy a car some in the next 20 years and it'll fit that
B008A5Y0HG|5|Worked great and programmed first try. Perfect.
B00VH96FWK|5|really easy to use, stays on great, looks great
B00KJLM65W|5|Works nice
B002V4VLOC|4|BEST I'VE USED
B00DSK0L9O|3|Gets gummy if it is in the sun. Hello car windshield. Otherwise, it's not too bad.
B006RLIY9K|3|These went right in and worked fine until I tried to adjust them.  The passenger side would not adjust height until I gave it a few good raps with a screwdriver handle (stuck) then it adjusted but in a jerky fashion making it hard to set right.
B00B0Z6J72|5|Perfect fit
B00DX89H7I|1|UPDATE - This battery was almost completely useless.  It worked for about a month, then the bike sat for 2 weeks. It had enough juice to start the bike, but left me stranded 2 hrs from home.  When I got it home and put it on an approved charger, it wouldn't a charge.   This battery fits great in my 2006 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R (636cc). Battery came fully charged, bike cranked first try.  This battery weighs maybe 1 lb. The battery it replaced weighs approximately 9 lbs. When I picked up the box I thought they shipped me an empty package. I'll update this review is I discover any negatives to this product.
B00D3YEGO6|5|I love it!❤️
B00I9SK8XY|5|Exactly what I needed!
B002UWLDSO|5|Just put it in my daughters car and it works perfectly!
B00EPDLT5I|1|Didn't come with pin to lock it on
B005HSOTZM|5|nice
B000C2JSXG|2|They are breaks. They are also the rear breaks. That was not specified
B00UKWRD6M|5|Works as described!
B006H34AE6|5|We have 4 cats and recently purchased a house with all hardwood floors. While I'm thrilled that vacuuming is now a lot easier, I am constantly annoyed by the matted cat hair in the low-pile area rug by my desk. Vacuums can't touch that hair.<br /><br />This brush does exactly what it says. If you are unable to do some tough arm work to get hair out, this might not be the product for you. I had no issue though, and didn't mind spending the 30 min or so getting TONS of hair out of the rug. Bring a trash bag or something along with you, as you'll be collecting mats of hair constantly.<br /><br />This would probably work fabulously for a couch or car interior, and with a lot less elbow grease involved. I can't imagine this would work well with a very high-pile rug or other upholstery, but I haven't tried it. I was at first concerned about the vigorous rubbing causing pilling on the rug, but that didn't seem to be an issue.
B008EXHNZA|5|oem type product
B00252A0M4|5|Product replaced my old broken door handle pretty well. It comes unpainted black, I used the duplicolor perfect match, 2 coats of base coat, and 2 coats of clear coat. Matches okay, i am going to try and wax it to try and match the paint as best i can. it took my 1.5 hours to do the job.<br />It Would have been very nice if they included some instructions, especially considering how technical it is to get the lock cylinder out of the old handle, and then to install it into the new one.<br />All in all, Its well worth the $19 to have a brand new door handle. I saved $40 buying it here on amazon compared to autozone.
B000EH0ORI|5|Very useful.  Works well.
B0049HCOT0|3|Good for under a patio table, but very light weight. The wind blows it all over the yard. For 25.00 it's ok.
B00EP99H0G|5|Very nice.  I have an Atlas trailer with a 2 /16 ball.  Fit perfectly.  Nice and snug.
B00ED2IZWG|5|adorable sticker.....arrived quickly....very happy
B007IW6ZFM|5|Arrived on time and took about 10 seconds to change.
B00O83NSD6|4|They work great, no issues so far; had to make a few adjustments to make them fit better, nothing major... I really enjoy the new look on my truck
B00KAIJS4Q|5|Great
B000066OC7|4|Wish it were a little thicker,
B0002RPGOG|5|They last long.  Well worth the money.
B00AK9Z3NA|5|nice rigid design...plenty of space
B00TJ0Y0FS|5|Great lights and work as expected.
B00DJ7OMCS|5|Great
B004809YBE|5|price good, shipping,good.
B002Z64P4Y|4|Fits fine, does the job.
B00UIP4EXG|5|Best I have had this far. I like the quality of the material. Will be purchasing again.
B002RL3E62|5|Great product
B008PW52OY|5|Its been working great for the motorcycle valves that I've been taking out. works like it should the only issue I have with it is the adapter will tend to spin when tightening the spring down. This causes issues when removing the keepers that hold the valve into place. So I have to hold it while spinning the anvil. Other than that great product for the price.
B000NPIYF0|2|Soapy water works better then this tool. It has to be so close to the leak  to sense it. I kinda feel like its a waste of time.
B003XPMNL8|3|Several terminals and wire connections were loose or not connected at all.  Had to take unit apart to make operational
B00A93TE00|4|Great little front license plate. The craftsman ship seems solid, but be aware that the Honda emblem is not as prominent as in the picture. It really goes and blends well with the glossy black license plate, but does not stop it from looking good at day.
B00DZPC5NM|5|Works wonderfully and was so easy to set up!
B009NUJQSU|5|Much much better than the stock black honey comb grill. Not difficult to install. Very happy with it.
B00CD2R3E4|5|Easy to install  looks good A+++++
B00OL4QK4Q|3|Very good price, quality not the best
B007VR5YHO|5|Great
B003S5YV4U|2|The product arrived promptly and in good condition. The only issues were that the holes for the speakers were not the same as the factory and neither were the wiring clip holes. While it did fit it isn't an excact match.
B000IYPSZU|5|Perfect fit for 2004 Honda accord 4cyl. Was about to install without removing radiator.
B00TXI0JT2|5|great little mirrors
B00F6JU2EE|4|Not as bright as I hoped. But work well
B000CO9FF0|1|Bulb lasted less than 3 months.  Now looking for replacement.
B00Z646LSK|2|Well it is what it is you get for what you pay. The product it is not very well made parts from the original one do not fit right. The key do not even come out of the case.
B001Y93PO4|5|Wo, worked out great everything fits fine quick speed thank you very much
B0009JKGII|5|I bought this product with the bug and tar remover mits. It took a lot of muscle to get out a lot of the tree sap, but it did the job. The smell is a little nauseous after a while but the product itself has a good consistency. Definetly will go with this product again in the future but I would use the sponge/mits with it.
B00ED6D8W4|5|Excellent product. Thinner than what I thought. Keeps road noise down, makes the interior look great. Very easy to install!
B00SXWZ08E|5|Great so far, and fast delivery
B00EZUL6ZY|1|Smells bad, low quality plastic.
B00BX5D9I6|5|Perfec
B00JLN5O76|4|Rides great
B00D75HFQ2|3|Ok
B0031B6AQI|5|Once again great product! Much better than the old rubber strips that dry rot way too soon.
B00Q5CT9VI|4|Nice finish and sturdy. Matches expectation and price point from Cocoweb. A little lateral play taken out by spacer. Not confident enough to leave on during winter salt months.
B009OBVS20|4|I tried using this compound for removing key marks in my vehicle but it just didn't completely do the job.
B00TRCPUG6|1|Terrible. The suction is very weak. I got it to stick to the dent, but as soon as I pulled, it came right off.<br />In theory it should work, but it's just cheap crap made in China
B00APOERLO|5|I bought this as a gift for my husband who loves his Pontiac G8 and he displays this proudly on his car.
B00I551I1W|5|Perfect fit for a 2004 Acura TL. The replacement arms have only been in for a day but they work well and they hold up the hood without issue. It actually takes a bit of effort to collapse the shocks and close the hood, but that is a good thing because the hood wont be falling down any time soon.
B001OJJWWI|1|Sticker is nice but the clear sticky paper the fox decal is on is not clear it is densly foggy u cannot see thru it
B001U8MPMM|5|Good quality.
B012MZGKOU|3|Ended up getting this for our GMC Yukon. Also went and used it on a GMC F1500, a Ford F-150, and a Mazda b2300 pickup truck. For the most part the device performed well. Sometimes if you connect and disconnect multiple times over a scan, then it will require a restart of the adapter until Torque (the app of choice for ELM327 units like this) can communicate with it again. Sometimes the connection was slow as well, but that could have been a lot of factors during actual driving. I also LOVE the fact that it has an on/off button right on the front there.<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Well...<br />If you're pairing this wifi unit with a 4G Smartphone, you have to choose between communicating to the unit OR connecting to the internet, not both at the same time. The direct connection between the Smartphone and the Wifi takes up the full Wifi connection, disallowing you from connecting to the internet, while the Wifi connection itself has overlapping frequencies with the 4G radio on your phone, so your phone doesn't allow you to connect your wifi and 4GB at the same time. At the very least this was the case on my Galaxy Note 2, though I've heard this is the case with many 4GB phones.<br /><br />This means that: I'd have to disconnect from the internet, connect to the device, run the scan for fault codes, then disconnect from the device, reconnect to the internet, email myself a report on the fault codes, look up the meaning of the fault codes, then disconnect from the internet, reconnect to the device, and wipe the codes. And remember what I said about repeated connect/disconnects would require you to restart the unit?<br />---------------------<br />With all that said, apart from that glaring flaw for use with my smartphone, the device worked well enough, and even if the need to restart it or occasional slow read was due to a bad unit, I've dealt with Etekcity before and I know they would have replaced it with very little difficulty and would have taken care of me.<br /><br />I'll be getting a bluetooth code reader now so I can scan and have internet access at the same time, though Etekcity doesn't make one at this time./>I'll be getting a bluetooth code reader now so I can scan and have internet access at the same time, though Etekcity doesn't make one at this time.
B000EQTSOO|5|Fixed rough 2-3 and 1-2 shifting
B00INVEQYE|1|No where near an 18 gauge wire. It is maybe a 22-24 gauge wire. It has a real thick insulation to make you think it is a larger wire.
B008BLNXR2|1|I would give no stars just the fact I ordered blue, thought I got blue installed on headlights and the peeling was blue the actual piece that stays on headlight is clear. I've all ready cut and put on so can't return.
B001LA18W2|5|Looks great, stays adhered. Can't ask for more.
B00IGZQT38|4|Quick and perfect
B000NW8EU8|5|Good price and product. To The door.
B000S2SKIY|5|Beat price on the net!!!
B000C9N8G2|5|Great part, fit and work good
B00L5JUJ1A|5|Worked good
B00QG1H546|5|Excellent trader.
B003RY53U8|5|keeps drinks cool and hot if needed, great for outside work.
B00RVHIB3I|5|very good item good price too
B003RF5AWI|5|So far it's a great battery.  Altough it shipped with enough juice to fire up my bike without a hint of hesitation, I did notice it keep my trickle charger &#34;red lighted&#34; for a whole day and then I took it for a long ride and that seemed to have topped it off.  No signs of weakness.  No problems at all.  I'll keep it on a charger and keep my fingers crossed it lasts me as long as my first battery (6yrs.)
B00CZALB7Y|5|this and the check valve within the fuel pump is why your Ford Ranger is running like crap and giving you a P0171 error...
B004GEWP7C|5|Fits as good as OEM.
B000R308RA|3|its ok
B00F7GYU3A|5|Really Nice
B00I5LCEAA|5|The dishes in our RV stay in one place with these these are great buy them good price too
B003VXRPL0|4|Great product for racing applications. Bought two containers...one to use right away and the other to keep in race trailer in case we need it. Appreciate the high boiling point and have had no brake problems since using this brand.<br />Definitely recommend.
B004VT8D8W|5|Lights are bright. Easy to install. Watch the video. After 10 years my OEM lights were cracked and looking old.
B00D8Q28ZS|1|got wrong headlight bulbs for Goldwing just e mailed will try to workout  possably wrong kits
B00M5GJUQM|5|Great job
B00199BO4C|5|Lots of spark
B00YMEEYRK|5|First let me say, I ordered a 4 pc light set. What came in the mail was 4 boxes with 2 lights in each box... 8 lights for  $40... what a deal... Will update with a better review after installing and using for 30 days.
B00E5PK8TE|3|battery is just OK.  So far it will only hold full charge for about one day.....and after five days of not being used it will only hold a 50% charge. I use a digital &#34;pulse&#34; charger so that sulfation and over charging are not issues. the battery I replaced was the original on my 2007 FLHX......so.......longevity of this one is too be seen
B013ME9PII|5|Awesome product.  Its easy to install and is a simple fix for a frustrating problem.<br /><br />Pros<br />Quick to install<br />Doesnt damage bike or helmet<br />not noticeable when not in use<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review
B000EVP84I|1|Doors rods fit a 2002 dodge durango slt 4.7 ltr???
B00BI3QW32|5|It worked great I actually need one for other side
B004ZF4MW8|5|Just installed them in my 2011 Ford Fusion. They went right in with no hitch. They are very bright during the day. Can't wait till night to go for a ride. Bulbs look very high quality and the ballast looks very high quality also. I already had the capacitors from a previous install. I will update tomorrow after night falls.
B0023VBW6A|3|When the package arrived the corner of the taillight was chipped.
B006TMMMIG|5|Works perfectly
B000RXNLK6|5|Great detail product for the &#34;detail junkie&#34;. Just spray on and use a high quality micro fiber cloth to wipe off. Provides a nice shine and reflective qualities to the paint,. I use this on all of my premium sports cars. Great price for under $10.00....keep your car looking great. Use after washing, or dusting the car.
B00KVC78RU|4|Will this fit my 1990 300zx
B00N3WJAYY|5|These work perfectly in my 2010 Ford Fusion, which I honestly expected given that I researched which size to use.  :)  I was concerned that the blue shading on the bulb would cause some color issues, but I can't see any difference between these and the stock Toshiba bulbs that came with my car once installed.<br /><br />I needed to get a replacement because one of my rear blinker/brake lights went out, so I popped on to Amazon, ordered these, and had them two days later.  I love this place.  :D<br /><br />Folks recommend replacing these in pairs because the brightness of a new bulb might not match that of your older bulbs, so it's great that these are sold in a two-pack.  At under $7 for two, I think these are a good deal.  I'm quite happy that these seem to be the same brightness as the remaining good bulb from when I bought the car, because that means that I don't have to replace both of them right away.  I started to replace the second one anyway, but the trunk liner on the side with the still-good light was giving me trouble when I tried to move it out of the way, so I just decided to leave it.  Hey, if it ain't broke...  :)<br /><br />I sure hope that they last as long as my original bulbs (the first one just went out after five years), but even if they don't, they are pretty inexpensive.  Anyway, if these fit your vehicle, I have no reservations in recommending them.
B00NH6AR3O|5|Great sticker!!
B000JZYWQO|2|Fit fine works fine a little quiet for my taste only problem was it had surface rust on arrival
B00GSAUHB8|3|It works, but slips down in my Honda CRV. First few attempts to prop it up with my sun visors can be an ordeal, and in really hot 100 degree weather, not something I want to spend an extra minute doing while parked in the lot. The only way I can get this to not slip is to pull it upwards towards the visor so more of it rests on the visors, but the very bottom of the protector wouldn't cover the very front of my dashboard - a catch 22. I think it needs to be a couple inches taller.
B001NYQRUY|5|Great product
B00WFRQZ28|1|I bought 4 of these lights and only had them mounted on my quad I use to push my wing sprint around in the pit's one day only and washed my quad by hand and all 4 lights have water in them and one of the lights the amber light stays on and goes off once in a while, I recommend buying other lights, now I understand why they are so cheap.
B00LHK6XU8|4|Arrived on time, good quality for the price
B0000AZ9KS|5|WORK GREAT
B007Q1EXYA|5|Installed into my 2013 F-350 with the 5th wheel prep package in about 30 minutes from opening the box to finish. It was very simple and easy to do by myself. Very solid and easy to remove and reinstall in less than 5 minutes.
B00MKHWD92|1|Did not specify size when I ordered it. I was led to believe it was adjustable and it's not. Now I'm stuck with a hat that is to big. Cost more to ship back than I paid for it.
B001Y8XUL8|1|THEY LOOK GOOD, BUT MAKE ALOT NOISE WHEN YOUR CAR IS MOTION. I TRIED PUTTING OIL TO MAKE THEM QUIETER AND THAT DIDNT WORK. IF YOU BUY THEM PUT THEM ON THE CAR AND PUT THE CAR UP FOR SALE OTHER THAN THAT, BE PREPARED FOR A LOT OF NOISE WHEN YOU DRIVE.
B00YGRS230|5|Just what I wanted.  Works well, folds up nicely.  Would buy again if I needed another one.  Would recommend.
B008SG7ZAG|5|It Fits On My sv650 Snuggly
B010XZRQCG|5|Amazing product.  Very well made and very bright all around.  I use this for my plates and my bulb is at an angle. So far this one has been the best to light up my plate. More to follow on durability
B005BNZFQ0|5|Absolutely perfect adapter for RV Camping, use it to plug a 30 amp 4 prong L14 locking generator TT50 outlet into your 50 amp Camper Power Cord. Very convenient handling grip on the TT50 end. Sturdy enough for frequent use & much safer handling than a combo single plug type which can shock you or burns out easy.<br />While we do not frequently primitive camp using a generator we are now better able to use the Camper as a base in event of longterm power outages such as post hurricane or ice storm where the generator does not have enough power to run the house heater, fridge, freezer, lights, hot water heater & stove - we can run all just like camping limited to using only 1 air conditioner.
B00E1SOLH0|5|good
B004SRK6NC|1|Even though the product was specified for a 2011 2 door Honda Civic - it did not fit well.  The clips that secure the product around the wheel wells are inadequate - so much so that at highway speed the bra was snapping against the car with enough force that I had to remove the plastic to avoid them from scratching the paint at a rest stop.  I am not satisfied with this product and would caution other potential buyers to be aware that that the 'custom fit' is nowhere near so.  If I could get my money back I would.
B00CT2XYAK|5|Fits perfectly in my 2015 Honda Fit

B011Z7DE2C|5|Good
B0036U02WM|5|Works great, easy installation
B00QXVUS52|1|The item came without the rubber washer at the base, therefore there is a 1/2 inch gap between the base of the antenna and the vehicle part of the antenna.
B002JATYOC|5|came soon.looks good.
B000C95PW2|3|i ordered two of em....one was brand new, and awesome.....the other looked like it had been slightly used, and it was dirty, but functional......i also had to trim the dirty one, of its excess rubber, which was blocking a 1.5&#34;x1.75&#34; (or so) hole(which was easy to trim...but what the heck.
B00KE1AY2O|3|It was a little small and caused the seatbelt to curve in at the edges

B005ZHRNOE|5|Perfect fit for my 2011 Golf TDI 4-door. Great insulator. Well made and sturdy.
B00CMUD8E6|1|Looks different from what's in the picture. Definitely not the same as the stock '12 crv cabin air filter. As one of reviewers have noted, it does not have that support/structure as the original; looks and feels cheap! Disappointed!!!

B00062YVIY|1|This is the fourth one I've bought due to the others breaking.  When I got my car, it had one on it that failed.  I bought one (#2). The second one made it a few months.  Since I was under time constraints, I just bought another after that one failed in a few weeks (#3).  At this time, I was wanting something else, because this is getting stupid, but again, I put it off, and didn't have time to mess with it, so got another (#4).  Of course, it failed DURING my race.  Yes, being a moron, and putting it off until the last second again, I got another (#5).  It failed.<br /><br />I don't know if they have manufacturing issues or what.  I even tested by shorting the lead to the housing (with a gator clip) to verify that it was not a housing grounding issue, like so many others have experienced, and the gauge worked fine, and I had proof the grounding was fine.  Every new sender worked initially, then crapped out.<br /><br />Startup pressure on my system is ~75 PSI, and running is ~45-50 PSI, so I know I'm not exceeding the sender's capability, and I know the oil is clean and not clogging up the unit.  AWFUL.<br /><br />There is NO EXCUSE for this type of failure, THIS many times.<br /><br />Update:  I called Autometer, and spoke with someone in tech support (got right in, no waiting, nice guy on the other end).  He stated that they have had issues with some vehicles and certain harmonics that caused failures of the senders.  He recommended remote mounting the sender.  He was sympathetic, but that was the only solution he had.  I didn't want to buy ANOTHER sender (would have been #6!) and I didn't want to do a &#34;remote mount&#34; for the sending unit, because that's not acceptable.<br /><br />I got some time, so I bought a VDO Vision series mechanical gauge, installed it, and haven't had any problems with it.  I wish I had done that initially, instead of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result (...isn't that what they call &#34;insanity&#34;?).
B000GZBZOE|2|Did not fit right, and I know I installed them correctly.  On both front doors window hits the visor.

B00063ZPBU|5|good product
B00OBOLW1W|5|Great product, easy install
B010VCLX1Q|5|Helps with the sun and the wind.  The tie clips are very easy to hook and are in the correct location.  I have a red 2012 so I got the red top.  If I did it again I would get the black due to a red glare.  I took it off for the winter because I don't want to over stretch the bungees.  If they go bad the top is no good.  FYI  - It is NOT a rain cover and does not claim to be.  I use door bars or no doors all summer, no top at all.  I drive 75 miles each day at turnpike speeds.  No flutter or flapping problems.  My cover fits over with no problem.
B00TQAZP6E|5|First impressions are great. The light is crazy bright and the curved look is awesome. The wire harness is really nice. I mounted the light to the roof of my polaris rzr and it looks great.
B00B9H3XWK|5|works great, easy to install matches the original one as well.
B002R109DS|5|Easy to install and made the front look new again.
B000C1LW0E|5|great quality
B00527Z664|5|It is great to be able to charge things as I am driving however I must admit, charging DSLR batteries takes quite a bit of driving to charge but then they also take a while to charge in the wall socket.  So I might have to rethink my strategy and look into a small solar panel and trickle charge a small battery to draw off that.  Am happy that I bought it. The USB works great and I didn't find it made that much noise.
B004RCRS9I|5|Holds a ton of soap - perfect, bought an extra one for another satisfied customer as a gift. The side brushes are great for under the mirrors and keeping the base from hitting my car/trucks.
B00HTOXOKS|5|works great, looks great.

B000CPCBF0|4|Used it to service the differential on my Crown Vic. Performed as would be expected from a Red Line Product.. I am immensly pleased and would recommend it to anyone.
B00WXQBUQ2|5|Arrived quick and as expected the product is excellent.
B00CPL918E|4|Used this in my Harley. The dreaded lifters noise went away. The motorcycle runs like a dream.
B00IVHGYYA|5|The case itself isn’t that strong and the clear window by the bits tends to pop out, but overall I think this is a good set. To open the case, you press the button on the side, and the lid raises and the bits pop up via spring action. The kit includes 20 screwdriver bits for a wide variety of uses in electronics. Both the handle and (bit) extension have magnetic bit holders, and there’s a non-slip grip with raised rubber dots on the handle. There are also thumb indentions for improved grip and force around the base of the handle (toward the bit). If you want, you can even hang the screwdriver by the hole in the end. The case fits nicely in a work shirt pocket. Please note: I received this item in exchange for my honest review.
B004N6NR2U|3|Fit was decent, mounting hardware is garbage, reuse factory or get new ones from a store for 5$. Be prepared to think, there is no installation instructions and you have to mount the fans yourself. Other wise not a bad set up
B0016KFW06|5|Works great. Install was quick and easy and the fit was perfect.
B00282YGA8|5|Fits perfectly and was extremely easy to install.
B0032YUKMY|1|Wife got me one for our aniversary. This bra has a very nice look. I love the look.  I had it professionally installed.<br /><br />It did not fit snug it was particularly loose under the front bumper and on the lateral distal aspects of the headlamps. The bottom bilateral corners in front on the wheel wells began to fray and fail, eventually tearing away from the clips. This unit was installed in July 2015. It is now August 2015.<br /><br />I am going to have to remove the bottom section of the bra.  This is very disapointing. I love look and feel of the bra. Sadly, the quality of the product is very poor, not made to last.
B00W8ADB1K|4|I do like this Car Organizer. It works great especially for my back seat passengers. Water bottle holder, bagged snacks, magazines and small computer/pad holder. Even the white printed JACO looks good. And this HangPro will look good in a RangeRover as well as a Scion.<br />My only concerns is that the stitching is a little flimsy on where the head rest straps come together on the organizer body.<br />My resent organizer seems to be completely redone and stitched better, but i see that one of the straps is sewed into the cording and not to the cardboard backing as well.<br />I hope that it can take some weight without ripping.<br />I will update if i find failure in this product.<br />The company is a pleasure to deal with.

B00BT76O30|5|Fits well and the color matches.  USPS bent the first one and Revemoto sent a second one very fast.
B002C3S1I6|4|Well made and pretty easy to install. Hardest part was removing old bent parts.
B001N729FS|5|My usage involved with one end of this switch needs to connect with all 12V terminals while the other end of this switch connect to a &#34;inteli-power Progressive Dynamics 60 amp PD9260C Converter&#34;.  So, I can switch off all the 12V terminals while the PD9260C conducting 60A charging at night.  Works well.
B006FRQZOW|1|Looks great, came as described, but will not fit electronics from old fob. Seller responded no other type/style available. Vehicle is 2001 VW Golf, looks very similar, but took a chance due to good price, and just as some other reviews (however those were regarding 2000 VW Golf,) Be careful.
B004NBO440|5|I loved that the price and ease of replacing this whole module.. Hubby installed it quickly and it fit my jeep perfectly.. I have to say, the price was the best thing.. This module usually goes for up to $400 and what we paid for it on this site was a huge life saver!!  Thank you

B000WEMH4G|5|Quality construction is obvious.  Wire is large gauge.  Installed easily and works perfectly.
B00NDZNDL2|5|I have been searching and searching for a Dime sticker for my husband. It goes well with his slayer, opeth and led zepp stickers.<br />Quality is great!
B00QSH7E4Y|4|I got it on but it was a fight !!  The plastic attachment plugs are similar to the plastic inserts you use to mount your license plate on your car. They need a redesign , the back that goes into the hood needs to be at least twice as long because when you try to put the screw in they pop right out !  Now on the other side there is a rectangular moulded area that is to fit in the slot on the bug shield ,it also should be a least two to two and a half  times taller so it doesn't twist out of the slot . This is what causes the fight cause when it slips out it twists and the insert pops out ! If these improvments were made the instalation would only take about 15 to 20 min. maybe less. Once it on it looks good just hope it stays put.
B00IKSK8JM|5|Very Nice
B00OABWY5E|5|Awesome product. Durable.
B000C2EGK6|5|Fits my 2004 Ford Taurus SE with OHV engine.
B007XTOMHI|4|Got the batteries quickly.  Installed easily for me.  Hoked up to charger and after a minute it showed full charge, so I guess they ship fully charged.  Havn't had a chance to test batteries yet to see if they last longer than what they replaced.  Only complaint so far is the item description says these are 5.5AmpH batteries, but they are only marked at 5 AmpH.
B000S0N2RU|5|Nice to be able to adjust, I think it is the right one to get
B00HL1X288|3|Good strong tools.  It is what I expected.  Three stars because the inside part the holds the  drill bits was broken.
B00M9MY67A|5|I find it odd that this pack received very high reviews on a motorcycle gear site but terrible reviews on Amazon. It's also interesting that the high-vis version of this exact pack has stellar reviews on Amazon, with the only difference being the color of the fabric.<br />That being said, I've used this pack several times over the last few weeks since I purchased it from Amazon. It is well built and sturdy. A bit heavy, but excellent support. Good strap control. Excellent size. Very good visibility. Comfortable when riding. I can't yet speak to how it will hold up over extended use, but at this time, I'm completely satisfied.
B00COYNZJ8|1|I was very excited to get this because I have always been a huge Star Wars fan, however I was disappointed to see that after only 5 months this started flaky. It was only a little at first, and then one day I picked it up and found a huge mess on my car floor from it! Would love to get another one however the quality and lifespan is not worth the cost.
B00GURL6OG|4|Seems like it doing what its suppost to
B00EPROSES|5|Perfect, impressed with purchase!

B000CQBG1O|5|Good replacement for old hardware
B00DYAF9FY|1|This stuff is easy to apply and sticks great. But it stinks! I used it in my trunk and every time I opened my trunk I was greeted by a nasty odor. I have left the trunk open for days but it always returns and 3 months after I installed it the odor remained and entered the cabin. I finally had to remove it which was a very unpleasant task. Hopefully I received a bad batch and this is an uncommon occurrence. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the stink.<br />Edit: One year later, my trunk still stinks. My wife got so tired of it, she put an odor remover in it. Now my trunk smells like lilacs in an asphalt factory. I regret the day I installed this.
B009BI94PE|5|Comfortable fit, pretty decent construction. I can see these lasting for a while.
B0039HBORO|4|It works.
B00BCRMAR6|3|Love the colors. Not the greatest material though

B00WG8IUDI|5|Hello, This product is suitable for the BMW 318 E-90 2008?
B00413GK2E|1|Please do not buy this bumper. After having this for 3 years and washing my truck frequently, almost every 1-2 weeks, this is what it looks like. Rust has started everywhere and is appearing at every corner and edge possible. I just took my bumpers off today to repaint them finally and I also realize my bracket is broke from using the tow mounts that are built into the bumper so please be careful with them. Should of bought road armour

B0031ZDU62|4|For starters, my wife drives a 2007 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer 5.4L. Thanks to  an incredibly poor design, I have already replaced all 8 spark plugs and 4 coil packs.  If you purchase these at your local auto parts store as I did, you will pay approx. 60 to 80 dollars a piece depending  on the brand. After seeing the preceding reviews, getting engine hesitation, and seeing the all too familiar engine light, I decided to give these a try.  The first thing I noticed about the coil was that the attachment flange and hole is 90 degrees from the electrical connector.  The stock coil pack is 180 degrees, which thankfully, wasn't a problem because the wire harness had long leads, and no surrounding components interfered with the install position (this may not be the case with your vehicle).  Secondly, the rubber boot has an additional 1/2 inch of rubber (beyond the metal contact spring) that I needed to remove so it would make contact with the plug.  Also, the rim that closes off the opening in the head to the plug is smaller, so water and other debris may get in easier .  The only redeeming quality about this experience with my POS vehicle (many other unforgivable  issues - last Ford ever) was that the installation was relatively easy.  I was able to replace 4 coil packs ( cylinder 2, 5, 6, and 7) in about a half-hour. Remember - this coil pack was made to fit multiple vehicles, so you will need to be  prepared to get creative if it doesn't  match your existing application.  I did also want to mention that as with most of my Amazon purchases, shipping was very fast (from the time the order was placed, 5 days). So far, I have put on about 500 miles with these coil packs and am happy to say the dreaded  engine light hasn't returned - not for the coil packs anyway.  Also,  don't forget to purchase some die-electric grease for your contacts on both the connector and plug (I also added some around the rim to fill in the void left by the smaller one).  The description said some was provided  in the package, but there was none in the box I received.  For 38.00 shipped, this was a no-brainer for me.  At 1/16th the price of a factory installed coil pack ( first one failed at 58k), I will be satisfied  if I can get half the mileage.  I will update this review in another 10k, or if I get a premature failure on one of these plugs.  I hope this review was helpful for you, and good luck with the installation. UPDATE 2/28/16 So my wife has put on about 12k  miles now, and I'm happy to say that 3 of the 4 coils that were installed have been trouble free.  I am not as happy to report that I have had one possible failure - After about a month of use, the &#34;Ford -5.4l triton engine sucks&#34; light came on, so I checked and found that cylinder 5 was misfiring.  I replaced the coil with another one from the pack and I was still having an issue.   I took it to my mechanic, and found that the tip of my new plug (top portion that connects to the coil) was completely burnt off! -mechanic was as surprised as I was.  I replaced the plug and the coil pack and have not had another issue. For this reason, I have downgraded my opinion to 4 stars.  I still feel that these are a fantastic alternative to OEM or other aftermarket coils, however.  There are well over 1000 reviews here with positive feedback, and if you are on a budget this may be your best option.  Good Luck, Eric.
B00LNNR9GG|5|These are great exactly as advertised
B001DKM3SI|3|Handle is a bit flimsy making it hard to apply pressure to scrub off the dirt. Wash mitt is a bit on the small side as well. However it does allow me to clean the roof of my van and the price is right. Get's the job done, just not that well.
B004H1RLRS|3|add said it fits 84 Goldwing but the 84 has a 7/8 handle bar so I will need to get some thing else. my fault I should have checked before I bought it.
B00MWPBXD4|5|Nice dash board holder.. although there is no sticky pad underneath it holds very well to the dash and has never moved or shifted while driving. Perfect size for a pair or 2 of sunglasses or a cell phone. Could be bigger but then the dash is curved so it may not work as well if larger.

B0130NLX8G|5|This is the prefect bag for my car. The instructions show it being fastened behind the drive or passenger's seat but I didn't like that it sat up so high so I fastened it behind my middle console and it looks so much better. This baby won't spill over or fall with the movement of your car so you can say goodbye to those 'accidents' that would occassionally happen where you'd have trash littering the floor of your car. It's so easy and simple I don't know why I didn't think of this! My favorite part is the heavy duty liner on the inside so you don't need a second trash bag for this 'trash bag' and seems like an easy clean if needed be.<br /><br />There's side pockets so if you have other intentions for the bag, it comes in handy for the beach, the gym, maybe even take it with you to go see a movie! I really love this product and enthused that I got it at such a great deal! Thank you InsideSmarts!
B009AA4886|5|Excellent product, delivered in a timely manner

B008VE0GA6|2|For 2001 Discovery 2:<br /><br />The radiator cools fine but the slots built in to slide the oil coolers are not wide enough that near the completion of the re-assembly it stalled the job by a couple of hours (shade tree mechanic working alone) because the oil coolers could not be mounted. Had to modify the radiator to get the oil coolers to fit; cutting and grinding on the plastic mounting points.

B00BRHM8FA|4|Excellent product that is really easy to use.  TPMS is now turned off on my 2010 JKU and tire size is updated for a perfect speedometer reading after moving up to 35&#34; tires from 30&#34;.  This &#34;tuner&#34; deserves 5 stars itself, but the update software took it down a notch for me.  Trying to install SPARK and the correct USB driver on certain computers is a real pain in the rear.  You may need to disable your firewall(s) and anti-virus software (or uninstall it like I did) to even get your computer to recognize the FlasCal.  Overall though, this thing is great.  If you're on the fence whether or not to get this for your JK, just do it!  Wished I had gotten one of these on day one after buying my Jeep.  I plan to download the update to make my FlashCal into a FlashPaq in the coming months.

B000E2CVDI|5|Why doesn't every oil filter come with a nut on it? This one feature alone makes this filter worth the minor extra cost over other options.
B001GF3QUE|5|good quality, fast shipping
B005VG6CGO|1|Very cheap! The plastic studs break so easily, buyer beware :/
B004AIGVZG|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.

B004HPSI6M|1|Didn't work with Garmin Nuvi 1450lmt. When connected with the Car Charger the device continued to show low battery warnings and shut down intermittently.
B00GU9FULO|1|It fell off on the first day I put it on😡 not worth the $20 I spent soo angry😡😡😡
B00S72R2UY|5|This worked well for getting an old wrap off of my car.  It saved me hundreds of dollars over having a pro do it.
B0022ZL5DW|4|Worked like I expected, remember to give it time to drain out after you soak the filter.
B00LO0M918|3|The bulbs are nice and bright, look like fluorescent.<br />But a 20% failure rate !!!<br />2 of the 10 melted and fell apart within minutes of turning them on.<br />Is there any kind of warranty ?
B00AWPHNB2|5|fit just right
B001GJ7HCI|5|helps a lot with the bird s***
B00YRJI3D6|5|Very nice key chain. Sturdy and has an easy ring for sliding keys on and off. Large ring holds a large number of keys without seeming bulky. Would recommend.
B00GRSOJSS|5|This stuff does remove rust, but keep in mind that you have to be able to immerse the rusted item in it for best results. You can't just rub it on something and expect it to work as well. It's very watery, so unless you have a container large enough to immerse whatever you have, you might want to try something else.
B00CJ7M5FA|4|Quick shipping. Seem to be decent quality.
B000UK1Y00|4|seems to work fine
B0031GYP5G|5|Not sure why other gave this only 1 start. Maybe they put it in a 97 civic. I just put it in a it worked. No adjusting or altering the product on my 04' civic
B01171RQV6|5|I ordered these for my husband's 2010 Jeep Wrangler and they fit perfectly. Installation couldn't be easier with the pre-applied adhesive - I was able to install them myself!
B00EAK07QI|5|Not much to say other than it does what it's supposed to.  Quick shipping.
B00RTFVGZM|5|I LOVE them! I can't wait to put them in my car. They are the perfect size, and easy to assemble. If you're a Disney fan,  you need to buy these and Disney-fy your vehicle, lol. They come with two air fresheners, but I ordered an extra pack just to have. Buy these and enjoy!
B0031XULF2|5|Works great and adds a sense of security when traveling and my car stays at home
B0038YNA16|5|I was quite pleased with this purchase. The device works well, it is not heavy to use and it came with an assortment of bonnets. If you are looking for an inexpensive buffer, this seems like a good choice.
B005C1Y9D6|5|Was a little tricky getting the light covers off, but after I watched the online video, they went in with a sinch.<br />Very bright and look cool too!
B00YDLV6PA|5|Worked perfectly. Fitment was 100%.

B00BXMRP4I|5|great
B000WEMH4G|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B0091Q3NCG|5|I drove a 1980 Chevy Citation for over 20 years, that car had been in my family since 1980. Unfortunately the engine crapped out and I acquired a 2000 Chevy Monte Carlo SS. came in handy when the check engine light came on.....if you just want a basic OBD II guide this is it!
B002YBKTRC|5|Exactly as described, fast shipping. Very satisfied, will recommend to everyone.
B00Y5L409M|1|I have a stock intercooler for my Ford f350 6.0 it said a fits but when I received it it was a size bigger its for an aftermarket intercooler 3.50 but sock intercooler are 3.25 I did contact the seller but he did not have the size I have told him I will keep it because it will cost me to send it back
B00A8MZ7IA|5|High quality.
B000C2Y9RG|5|Worked great.  WARNING... I tighten the rack/pinion end of the hose and it broke a piece off the rack/pinion housing.  Cost me $250 just for the new rack/pinion plus labor.  Be careful on how tight you put the hose on the rack/pinion
B00EENZ9MI|5|Boyfriend claims to like it...still don't see it on his car. Shipping was quick. Product was as described.
B007RE53MC|5|I have these for both of my Jeep Wranglers, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again. Perfect fit, no wiggle, rock solid Mopar part.

B000ALJYEW|5|Works fine
B00M1K80B8|5|mounted these on the front of my bass boat and they work as good as i hoped they would i would suggest these flood lights for night time boating and much more they really light up the way
B00700U44A|5|Very good
B003O4SA2E|4|I was a bit hesitant due to some of the reviews mentioning they were concerned the frame wouldn't hold the European plate  well, thus I waited to put a review. I have an Audi A7 and always get my car hand washed. Since I bought the German tag and frame, I have washed it 3x and have not had any issues. The frame seems pretty damn secure to me. No issues at all. It snapped right into place and was easy to assemble. Should that change, I will update my review. My only negative is the price tag for an all plastic frame, thus the 4 stars.
B00075OSC4|5|nice new item and fast shipping
B00CKINHZ0|5|Worked great!
B009F590L6|5|Exactly what I needed
B00DU0DXHE|5|I just got this jacket the other day and finally took it for a ride today. I have to say I have been to alot of stores and I bought this on a whim, because of price. IT IS WORTH IT. I rode today and it was 80+ degrees and the jacket kept me cool and the jacket work amazingly. If you considering it just buy it. I ride a dyna wide glide and it looks awesome on me and while riding. WORTH THE MONEY!
B00CEPUJEG|5|I purchased two front quick-struts for my 2004 CRV and have been pleased with their performance.  I shopped the struts around a number of mechanics when I received them and found most mechanics agreed to installation charges of less than 2 hours for both struts.
B007HFT034|5|Great replacement plug.  We pulled a few too many amps for a few too many days and ended up melting our RV house cord to the surge protector.  Plain instructions and a quick job done.  I chose to place some silicon around the openings to try and better seal it a bit better.
B001TZEIBM|5|For an econo unit that was only to be used one time, this was perfect.  The bonus is that I can use it again!<br />quick shipping.
B00NP60URE|1|vacuum to weak to be effective. Pump quickly over and over yet fluid draw is not enough. Adapters are very very soft mushy rubber. They do not hold tightly once wet with slippery brake fluid.
B00A2VHM1W|5|as advertised.
B009D9HEJO|1|Looked great for the first month or so, then fade out and look terrible. Now I need to see how hard they are to remove. Do not buy. Wasting your money.
B004SF3PMI|5|Fits perfectly on 1996 ford f150 4x4 4.9L.  Made the job much easier to renew the old truck back to new again.  need help getting off, just ask ill be more than happy to give ya some pointers.
B00WX5LIU6|5|Works great, fits perfect.
B00HEDYD1S|4|The shield was an exact OEM part match. I would have given it five stars but for the fact that the fasteners didn't come with the part as was described. I had to purchase the fasteners from the dealer and they costly. Auto parts store fasteners would not work. Tie wraps don't last.
B000AMGYNA|1|This is my first oil pan, because I am forced to do regular maintenance on my vehicles now living in a small town. I didn't buy this off of Amazon, but rather from a local auto repair store. I am unsure if it is even the same brand. But I do know that it's the same design and, as you've read in the other reviews, it is crap.<br /><br />The story: I drained about a quart from the final drive of my motorcycle, 4 quarts from the motorcycle engine, and about 7 from my car. The nozzle started leaking all over my garage floor. After attempting to secure the hot oil pouring out of the nozzle, which was pointless because over-tightening the stopper actually jumps the threads, I finally got smart and tilted it backwards (away from the nozzle) and unscrewed the stopper completely to find bits of plastic from the manufacturing jammed in the threads. Even after clearing the plastic, the stopper would still not secure properly.<br /><br />I finally got the stopper secured just tight enough that it's not over-tightened and it no longer drips oil everywhere (or maybe it just finally dripped enough oil out of the pan onto my floor that it no longer has enough to drip with, good grief).<br /><br />On top of that, the stopper in the middle of the pan collects oil itself because of its inverse conical shape (like an ice cream cone holds ice cream). I predict this will be annoying to clear out.<br /><br />When I go take this pan to the recycling center, I'm leaving the entire thing and getting something different from Amazon. Learned my lesson.
B00FOFZHEK|5|Excellent
B00PBOQY1O|5|Very easy to put in
B00H1I639Q|5|Nice, Shiny lug nuts! I bought these with 4 Pro Comp Alloys Series 31 rims. They look great on my 2011 Ford Ranger. I've had them installed for about 6 months now and no problems. Still look like new.
B007H8DKJG|5|Good quqlity wiring harness.
B008EMDRZ6|1|very dissapointed in design. nice material but doesnt have a place to clip the side of the seat cover to the side of the seat. tend to roll when entering the car. for the price i expected moe. be better to buy the cheap nylons and replace them more often.
B003UN4FXW|5|Leds work perfectly now.<br />Just plugged it in, on a 05 gsxr 1000, took less than a minute.
B00DSOUG5E|5|These are an awesome set of mic's from Sena. Got them in on a Friday and made a 300 mile trip with a buddy Saturday. No issues what so ever. Easy to get used to as far as the menus and buttons. Battery life is really good. Rode a total of at least 10 hours with no charge. They still haven't died on me. People who call me can't even tell I'm on bike blasting down the road. Will buy another set.
B004MUI7OA|5|Worked great
B004UQV3II|5|Easy install. Had to cut some of the pipe away for fan blades to clear.
B004AIZ3MS|1|Lasted precisely 1 month - long enough for me to gain sufficient confidence in it to throw out my old, dead starter, which now means that I'll have to pay the $70+ core charge in addition to the higher price of a new one from a more reputable remanufacturer. Not recommended.
B002WLP2LC|4|Not as bright as I thought they would be. Almost dangerous to drive at night without the brights on. Good look tho, intense blue in color.
B00062ZWTQ|5|Good fit. Mounts well on the truck. But that's what I expected from Auto Meter. If you don't want to change out your whole A Pillar cover this is what you need.
B00UU54QQO|5|arrived on time or before and was exactly as described
B00080QHMM|4|Product works great. Would buy it again.
B003NU0EM8|1|well this didn't work. it just comes right off it's so weak. might work if you car is made out of thin plastic
B001LEQ350|5|exactly what I needed...exactly as advertised. Great service. Thanks
B00KNN7NSQ|5|Does everything its supposed to.
B00DMTX2TM|5|They were very nice. They fit great and cover a lot more than original mats. I don't kick them up like a lot of mats I've seen. They were less money and were beter quality than their competition!
B0018YGB6Y|5|worked good
B00TPI88YS|5|Just  yes as described
B00GSAUHB8|5|Bought shade for 2004-2008 F150. Fits the front window and helps substantially in keeping the interior cooler in the California sun.
B00HXCGDI6|3|Received my Danny Gray Air Hawk seat a few weeks back. Great looking seat but still lacking on comfort, for the long hauls.
B000JQQQKS|5|Good value for a variety and multitude of bungees with metal hooks that have plastic guards over the ends.  Comes in a handy screw top jar that makes keeping these stored and together easy.
B00YI9WOGM|5|Looks Great Same As My Old Ones
B003O4S6B4|5|So I finally got these put on my bike. They are bright, blue, and pretty much awesome. They really light up the bike and the ground around it. The switch that came with it is a simple metal toggle switch, which I replaced with an LED Rocker switch. The four stars is because the double sided tape doesn't really hold well. I will at some point, I am sure, have to silicone the lights onto the bike. Other than that, you kind of get what you pay for and these are not expensive at all. They are going to do nicely though. The pictures were taken at about 11:30 p.m. on August 29th, 2015.<br /><br />Update on August 18, 2016 - Lights are still strong and look fantastic. I have updated them to a 5 star purchase. I was right about the silicone and even that was wimpy. I finally have them on strong and have since covered the wires in wire tubing to keep everything neat and tidy under the seat. Good product to learn how to do some elementary wiring with. Make sure you hook it all up correctly because if you don't the wires will burn up on you. Speaking from personal experience. Added a new photo.
B0087T3IHS|5|The mount is made of good quality steel with nice welds.
B00K7938O4|5|Great fit
B00NT5VDZ4|2|This steering wheel cover was excellent for a few days. It served its purpose and looked as it was described. However, after a few days was up the steering wheel cover started to no longer fit my steering wheel. It didn't stay on the wheel very well. It was obstructing my view of my speedometer. It was interfering with my ability to safely drive my vehicle. It was stretched out. I loved the product when I first received it. However, I am highly disappointed that in a just a few short days of having and using the product that it no longer was able to even be used.
B004A6JAF6|1|THIS WILL NOT fit 2013 Ford Escape or newer Escapes,It says it will but it does not.
B00IV7PT2S|5|i love customer service about this product the most
B00BTSH5M8|5|Saved me more than $100 over the same thing at the Ford store. I did need to have it programmed by a locksmith but that was only $40. Absolutely no reason to pay the cost of an OEM replacement key. We own a car lot so I frequently need replacement keys and remotes. I always check here first.
B007V2CGV6|5|The product is superior to the others on the market.  It works as advertised and custom fit is perfect.
B0082365AQ|5|This is a great product for the price. I have looked and have found nothing as good in this price range.
B000CQFWRS|5|Used to install my 2M mobile amateur radio transceiver. Perfect solution, well built.
B00QWXMGFQ|5|I'm still alive so it must be doing something right.
B0085IJXCU|5|Exact fit,
B00QMTAZ1W|5|neat item
B0017OCHZO|5|work good
B000CB94JU|5|Easy installation. This part fit the car perfectly. It's a 2.0t b7 a4.
B002MC0WSO|3|First of all, while the alternator looks black in the picture posted, it is actually silver.  Nothing wrong with that. It is just that I would have liked for it to match the rest of the engine, and not look like an aftermarket replacement.  Soon.The pulley is slightly bigger than on a  Mando alternator it replaces, and if your belt is factory like mine, you will have a hard time putting the belt one.<br />But my biggest disappointment though is that it is made in China!  What is not made in China now days, but I never thought I would put an alternator made there!  I still have the old, factory alternator, and I will have it rebuilt soon.
B0021W9R68|5|Fit well replacing the round cover. The old cover had been damaged and the hole was opened up.  This cover allowed me to cut out the damaged skirting and make a good looking repair. It also has a positive latch so the door dosen't open during tow. I may replace the keyed latch with a non keyed one because it is not necessary to lock the hatch especially with the &#34;universal camper key&#34;.
B00BTLEJXI|5|Awesome.
B00S3V9TQO|5|good buy
B00NLRWHDW|5|great jacket
B0007VFMA0|5|Fits my 88 f150 perfectly. All weld receivers like this are much better than the bolt together multifit ones in my opinion.
B005EPLJJC|5|Works very well, a great replacement for the original part.
B010JRHAAQ|4|Arrived on time. Installed easily. Had minor defect contacted seller. They promptly replaced bad part.
B000C4KILU|5|Its working wonderful no problem at all
B00407V70G|1|Way to thin!! I redid the cab corners on my truck this weekend. After 8 hrs of grinding, bondo, and sanding I was finally ready to spray. I thought at the 8th coat it was good. Nope! My truck is red an now it has cab corners that are pink. Thought maybe the clear coat would bring the color out. Nope, just shinny pink. Very disappointed. Will not buy again. Better off spending the money and getting GM paints. Now I got to sand off the $96 worth of paint an buy different kind and spray again.
B000GGMJS4|2|If one rides a bike they know that the road dirt splatters up onto your back and legs, which did a number on my driver's side seat. After cleaning it, I needed inexpensive covers to at least stop further damage. I didn't expect heirlooms for the price, but I did expect them to have a reasonable fit. Despite the car specific feature on Amazon, these do not fit a 2009 Honda CRV because of the arm rests. The covers are of reasonable quality for the price and attractive, but on both seat sides, they are scrunched up above the arm rests. This also puts undue pressure at the hem bottom and I am sure they will will tear in short order. I called the &#34;customer service&#34; number on the package... When I asked how to install them past the arm rest, the operator on the other end simply stated, &#34;Just because it says universal, it doesn't mean it will fit all cars.&#34; I pointed out that many cars have arm rests and how have they advised them in the past. She stated in four years of employment she had never had anyone call regarding the arm rests. Okayyyy. I am going to give them a try as they are better than the towel I had before, but if they rip in a few weeks, they will have been exponentially more expensive. If you are okay with a jimmy-rigged seat cover, I guess they will suffice.
B009PJK5QG|1|called manufacture to see if tool would work on a 2010 volvo xc60. they stated yes. ok ,ill buy it then. guess what. tool skips over this model year. even updated tool to latest software. was miss lead buy manufacture so i would purchase tool. shame on autel. do not purchase this or any other autel tool. if you state a product works on a specific model, then tool should work as designed. once again , i was miss lead by manufacture, not buy a third party seller.
B00684TAYY|5|Works great easy to program, will order again if something happens to the one I have.
B0080DJ3KM|5|Perfect fit, works well.
B00JRE1QIK|5|Perfect. It fits  great
B001FANRQI|4|Fits the 2004 Wrangler pretty well.  Will update later on durability.
B00UW05CIS|1|Didn't work on my 2011 Mazda3. Contacted seller and they told me to go to a dealer. I went to the dealer and they said the product was faulty.
B001C42OXY|3|Does not say how much it covers, but each can covers around 16-20 square feet (1-1.8 square meters) single cover. For better effects though, you need double cover. So basically it gives a good clear varnish but it is very expensive to other cheaper, though worse covers. You get what you pay for, though.
B0049CGJAU|4|Not sure if this is designed for a specific connector but I had to extensively modify it to work with mine.  I wanted to use it for a JK wrangler with a rugged ridge harness.  Still, it does the job.
B00O83U3UW|5|Easy and nice fit looks good
B010R2JCG8|5|Great stuff would do this again!
B00L5QRG4Q|1|Very fragile. Broke the first day or two.
B0050SG9KW|5|No problems so far, iv used it on about 8 cars now to check vacuum, set carbs up and set timing. Nice easy to read gauge.
B008RAEKAQ|1|Did not fit
B002LRUZXM|4|Lightweight gloves, with nice ventilation. Seem like a good value so far.
B007ZSZAKK|4|Ok
B00Q34AIUO|5|The steering wheel cover looks great on my Kia Soul.
B005F3G5BA|5|Worked out just fine.
B000XQ5IO4|4|Great kit, but could use more of each fitting
B00BD9HYE2|5|Nice helmet
B0130NLX8G|5|I received a discount on this car garbage can for giving my honest opinion and leaving a review and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. When it first arrived and I saw the fabric on the outside I got a little worried about how it would contain spills but when I opened it up I saw the LiquiShield waterproof liner and was instantly relieved (We poured water in it and it didn't soak through like I was expecting). I feel like this garbage can is going to last for a while- it feels really durable. The mesh pockets on the side are really great for storing extras (diapers, wipes, napkins, etc.) and definitely a bonus. Overall this garbage can is definitely a great asset to any vehicle (especially if you have kids or are on the road often).
B004YTP152|5|Fit perfectly! in my 2012 Explorer. Buy them...you won't be disappointed
B00HF40N06|5|It works great cleans the grease write off.
B00QNUO7FK|5|This is another product that I bought a few months ago, liked it so much I bought another set. The Rag Company #1 for microfiber.
B001JT0L46|4|overpriced, but it does what it's supposed to.  The included adhesive tape is sketchy.
B00Q3YRB6S|5|reminds of Sear's Craftsman tools; the hole is centered perfectly.<br />. not sure how durable the metal is since I tested it only on unfrozen threads;<br />but I mention that only for completeness.
B00A2XD7RI|5|The 22-inch version of this works perfectly as a guide for precision parking.  We have a three-car garage and we do park three vehicles in it, one of which is a Dodge Ram quad-cab that only fits in the middle spot.  That beast has to be within a couple inches of the garage door to leave enough room between the bumper and the back wall to get to the other side of the garage, and this is how we achieve that.  We back in smoothly and slow down when we approach the final parking positions, and I've found that the bumper stays in place on our finished floor surface without adhesives or bolting.
B0002MA56U|5|work great
B006MGV370|4|Keeps the spare tire covered and it looks great.
B00BLPS29E|1|1.) made of plastic and can be crushed with a pair of channel locks<br /><br />2.) numeric combination wheels are also made of plastic and be crushed by a set of pliers<br /><br />3.) metal slide is cast and the release clip is pressed or glued on which will fly off as it did with mine.<br /><br />4) lock functioning or not the fact remains that if there is a pocket knife and a will - there is a way to cut the chin strap.
B0064GVQP2|5|Fits perfectly on a Suzuki Swift 2010
B00GU7M0WS|5|as advertised
B00ON8Y2AE|5|Worked good fast shiping
B00WCPRFHW|5|Bright white lights seem to be good quality so far. Quick shipping, awesome price!
B002R4V2S6|1|Headlights don't even resemble any color near &#34;jet yellow&#34; as described or labeled. Very disappointed
B0002STRPO|4|It works well but is fairly oversized. I was disappointed that the fix was so loose, but it doesn't affect function.
B000CN7ADA|5|Worked great

B00UCNCSJ6|5|This Gooloo power bank not only charges my 12v tablet, it actually cranked my 1992 Mercedes 300D 2.5 diesel for several minutes!!!<br />--<br />I bought the Gooloo unit to have a small external battery backup for my Surface Pro 3 tablet PC, which requires 2.5 amps at 12 volts to charge--difficult to find in most external power banks.  USB chargers are only 5v.  Most small 12v batteries can't deliver 2.5A.  The Goolooo delivers up to 10A at 12v.  (It also has a standard 5v USB port and a 19v port and comes with most all cable adapters.)  So I was pleased but not surprised that it charged my tablet PC just fine.<br /><br />I got the surprise when I pulled my old car out of storage.  Naturally, the battery was dead.  So dead that the dash lights barely came on and the starter didn't even click.  I had coincidentally just purchased the Gooloo.  Most reviews on small, portable12v batteries with jumper cables suggested the power bank only works boosting a car if the auto battery is slightly weak, not mostly dead.  I thought the jumper cables were a marketing gimmick.  But I figured I'd give the Gooloo a try anyway.  My car started without hesitation on the first turn of the key!<br /><br />So that was a surprise.  But the belly-laugh surprise was yet to come.  After starting the car, I noticed it was nearly empty of fuel.  So I headed for the nearest gas station and ran out of fuel about two blocks away.  I reconnected the Gooloo and cranked for two 30 second shots trying to restart.  All I accomplished was filling the fuel lines with air and getting the Gooloo jumper wires scorching hot.<br /><br />So I walked to the gas station and bought a gallon of diesel. Put the fuel in, hooked up Gooloo, and cranked intermittently for another two minutes trying to evacuate the air from the fuel lines.  The car sputtered and popped, but never started. Again, the wires were so hot they were hard to disconnect. So I got another gallon of fuel.  Hooked up Gooloo for the fourth time and started cranking again. Eventually the engine fired off.  This tiny Gooloo battery cranked my car's starter for a 4 or 5 minutes on one charge!!!<br /><br />When I plugged in Gooloo, it was below 20% charge, and it only took 3.5 hours to fully charge it.  Jumping my car was in 85 degree F weather, not cold winter weather when it probably would not have done as well.  Conventional wisdom says a battery won't last long or will fail when discharging it as fast as I did.  I've only had my Gooloo power bank for a week.  And since jumping the car, I have only used it to charge my tablet and can't comment on how long the Gooloo will last.<br /><br />So far, I'm amazed.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00UCNCSJ6 GOOLOO(TM) 12000mAh Portable Multi-function Car Battery Jump Starter Power Bank]]<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UCNCSJ6?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0started cranking again.

B001RZC7DU|5|Sounds sick! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDNZmKMqasw<br /><br />Only negative is mine is a little too close to the fender bc it came slightly bent; but I don't think they're usually so close to the fender from the factory.
B0013GSQXS|4|Many of the comments that I've read before I ordered this said that it sheds everywhere... Not sure if that's true but mine hasn't really shed anywhere in my car, it just tends not to look as brand new after a certain period of time because your hands are always pressing onto the fur. However, love this steering wheel cover, I might just buy another one.
B00T0WJSIE|1|They didn't give me my windshield and front 2 door tints very dissapointed.
B0066COQII|1|I was so disappointed in this item. It took 15 mins of running my car to make about one ounce of coffee. Don't waste your money. I wanted to return it, and I missed the 30 day window so now I'm stuck with this useless coffeemaker, don't buy this!!
B0002STTQG|3|Didn't work for what I needed.
B002VMDA0W|5|Works great ! Holds many bumpers. The holder arms could be a little stronger as they bend with weight but still gets the job done
B007A3N1CE|1|It sucked and is not 600 what ever.had a small hole in it.Do not buy
B009LOO1DS|5|As described, easy to install took under 15 mins, works great
B00F542DQU|1|This is not the real fedral signal light it is cheaply made in china. I found that out after i bought them. I bought 2 i had one put on my window it fell off and only way it works after u turn it on yiu have to hit the pattern button and now dont keep the pattern
B00KK45XJO|5|Love this stickers!! Easy to put on and looks great !
B00LUZTTL0|4|so far so good
B0019I33FQ|5|very good item
B00Y1HSLHC|1|Transmitter does not sync. Followed the procedure exactly but did not program into the SUV. Tried multiple times alongside instructional video, but device failed to sync.
B0016GTTZY|3|ok
B000CLPDSG|5|Great stopping power in a good price.
B0033DM4UA|5|Just did my timing belt for a 2005 Subaru Wrx STi and all the bearings (Koyo brand from Japan) matched the original even the small diameter idler one was an exact fit. I've heard that some people had to buy that idler from the dealership. The timing belt guide spacer for the crank pulley was a plus but I used a 1mm piece of cardboard to set the other belt guides. Comes with instructions in the box but I used All Data Pro at the dealership I work at.<br /><br />I will post an update if anything comes up. So far so good.
B003YDY826|5|good heavy duty cord exactly what i expected
B00B0C1WKO|1|Sounded great but no reviews...  I'm really good to my brakes (normally get 75 - 90K miles per set) but one of these front rotors wore very unevenly and was shuddering in less than 5K miles.
B00L4TF32G|5|If it does what it says it does , I'm happyB
B000JFL8RK|3|works
B00CS332Q6|5|Fixed a common problem on an Envoy for very low cost.
B000C9K3WO|4|Seems like great quality. fit correctly like the original GM one. Works fine so far.
B013PP44TE|5|took some work but looks great
B004AIHKT2|5|Absolutely a must have replacement . Chrysler /Dodge knows about this defective part, but offers another plastic piece for replacement . Give yourself the piece of mind of a metal grade A craftsmanship part , that will out last the life of your car .BUY it
B000RFSARI|4|We bought this because it looked like a good item. We have not had an opportunity to try it out yet. We think it will work great and should find out on the next camping trip.
B00T7EN6OM|1|I've had other sheepskin belt covers that are soft fleece. These are NOT fleece. It feels more like scratchy, itchy fur. And they are very, very long.
B000CO81KK|5|I got a whole lot of more horsepower to my f150 1994 5.0 motor Very Happy
B009P1VBQC|5|It was exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price. I would buy from them again!
B00O6MRQ6O|5|Simple to install took me 10 minutes.  Only thing was getting the adjustements right.  BEWARE if you get the wrong adjustment for the brake pin it will lock up on you.  For my Ducati monster have the screw in the furthest out position was the correct setup.
B00CQ8NF7E|5|I love it!
B0021YZER2|5|Like other reviewers I was skeptical of this product.  My wife and I purchased a home with over 18 years of hard water on our shower doors.  We tried every product you could think of.  My wife was ready to just purchase new glass.  On a whim I looked up products on Amazon.  I found this one and decided to give it a try.  I decided to tackle the project today.  Let me tell you, this product is AMAZING!  It actually does what it claims.  Here is what I did:<br /><br />Using 0000 steel wool, I sprayed the glass with water then placed a little of the driven gel on the wool. (Make sure you use gloves).<br />I applied the gel using circular motions on the glass, adding more gel when needed.  I didn't use a lot of pressure.<br />Once the glass was covered, I let it sit there for 20 minutes.<br />Came back and using a dry micro-fiber cloth, I buffed away the gel.<br />I had to do this 3 times (the glass was really bad).<br /><br />The glass looks brand new.  It took a good portion of the morning, but it was worth it!  I wish I would have taken pictures.  Looks like next on the list is their polish product.  Stop trying other products and get this.
B00BSXDV40|5|Used this on my 2012 Kawasaki ZX6R after removing the factory exhaust and servo.  No fuel injection light issues and it works perfectly, freeing up a lot of room under my seat.  I do wish it was a bit cheaper but the product itself works great
B00R5Y2F0W|5|I like this organizer. Mostly I use it to protect the back of my passenger seat from little feet. At first I was worried about the strap crossing the lower part of the seat, but have not had any complaints from passengers regarding discomfort in sitting against the strap. It provides adequate coverage and does not flop around.
B00KC7NQ0M|5|Work great!
B001DRHMPA|5|Perfect filter for the C230.  Easy fit and makes me distrustful of the last pricey ($$) oil change done by the shop.
B00TA4MNYS|5|The set is excellent and will charge just about every electronic item I own. I received it on time and I its small enough to take with me on a trip.
B007M5QH4Y|5|Very happy with all of my recent purchases. Thank you.
B0058WXNOK|1|I product did not work as advertised. It was useless.
B00K35RZN2|1|First of all, I never realized this was a refurbished item until it arrived. The compressor basically stop working electrically. Now, I am gonna have to pay to have this compressor removed , and wait until you refund me for my purchase. Sorry but can not say I am quite a happy camper with this item.
B000C930YM|5|Great pads! stops great little dust.  No noise!
B00B7K9PBC|1|After a week of use on another keychain, I noticed that they ring is still there, but the part with the logo is gone.  The part connecting the logo to the small ball is incredibly weak, not worth buying.
B00GURQJRA|5|Great product..
B00429YAA6|4|Perfect for  persons that work in labor intense situations and want to keep the cars seats clean. Reasonable price. Sturdy fabric:)
B00GVOZ4B4|2|Color was probably 3 shades lighter than what's on car even though color on can matches the color code for car.  Woulda been better off good to have color made somewhere local
B00HG0A2NM|1|Put these on my Rzr XP1K and they have worked great. I have beat the hell out of them on the rocks. The added UHMV does help them slide over rocks much easier than bare aluminum. I have had a problem with rocks grabbing the inside front of the guard and bending it outward. I am going to look at trying to put a bolt through them or some way to attach the very front to keep them from continuing to get bent outwards. I think this will probably be an issue with any aluminum guard you install.  Update 10/27/15:  After running these for about 4 months now, both guards have broken on each side with the sides peeling back like others have said. I use my equipment but I dont intentionally thrash it. These havent held up very well at all. I would not buy them again if I had the choice. I would try a different brand that has better reviews. The UHMW is nice for sliding over rocks, but other brands offer the same set up for less money. Never again will I buy Pro Armor.
B004M0CZS4|5|Nice! Thank you!
B00N4TTIFM|1|This item does not convert your doors to gullwing doors, but instead to lambo style doors.  The title needs to be corrected because I hate lambo doors but do like gullwing doors.  Gullwing doors open completely different from lambo doors.
B002G3OG6S|5|They fit my Audi A4.  Great buy and 1/3rd of the cost from AutoZone.  IDK what Audi would have  even charged me....They were also delivered in less than 24 hours to my door. Great Buy!
B00K65EMQC|2|Description was great
B008YDJUG0|4|Work very well and are reasonably priced.
B000NJAAIK|5|Perfect
B010WX5CQG|1|Very poor protection from the sun, the shade this item provides still makes my son close his eyes and turn his head when the sun is hitting the window.
B000C122WG|5|Excellent
B007U5JRYI|5|I love this sticker I'm going to put it on a friends car
B0023VFUWM|5|It's good!!
B000CDAEAQ|2|worst wipers I have ever owned. I'm 70, and have bought wipers for Corvettes, BMWs, Acuras and many more.
B00J9OMB6O|4|oke
B00A6RL3MG|5|Came with everything needed to replace the leaky OEM part. Gasket and Thermostat are already installed in it. It's ready to install on your vehicle right out of the shipping box.
B00QMLTS8Q|4|Does the job, I no longer brace myself for the heat in my car after a day of work and leaving it in the hot sun
B0045V8CKU|5|Thanks, just the right fit.
B00ZVJ35XE|4|[[ASIN:B00ZVJ38XQ OxGord 17pc Set Flat Cloth Mesh Gray & Black Broken Stripe Seat Covers Set - Airbag Compatible - Front Low Back Buckets - 50/50 or 60/40 Rear Split Bench - 5 Head Rests - Universal Fit for Car, Truck, Suv, or Van - FREE Steering Wheel Cover]]I received this product at a reduced price in for my honest and unbiased opinion, and as an added benefit I also test this product by using it as we would daily. Including putting in a wheelchair having to separate the seats, tossing things in and out of the back, getting in and out of the car, going grocery shopping, and taking the dogs out for a ride. I needed to see if hair stayed on the product.<br /><br />Upon opening the product, all looked good, packaged well, explanation of contents very good it comes in a zippered bag much like that you get when you buy a comforter in the store. The bag contained all pieces, nothing missing. Seat belt cushions, there were four, steering wheel cover, five head rest covers, two bucket seat back covers and base covers, set base cover for the back bench seat, and cover fort the back bench seat with a bra zipper that allows you to lower one seat at a time without stretching the fabric too much, and a bag of hooks, A LOT OF HOOKS.  Of those hooks I could not use the majority of them.<br /><br />This was not an easy project and I will explain more later in this review. We did get it on the best we could. It covered the seats the best it could but it was evident halfway through it was not made for all SUV's, honestly not even sure how to classify our car I had to call Autozone to fine out. We drive a Prius 07, they said the closest we would come is something for an SUV.<br /><br />We needed to hook the elastic strings to one another underneath the seats, this could not be accomplished, we tucked them deep between the plastic of the area holding the seat and as close to the bottom as we could get. Putting the back on the bucket seats was just as difficult due to the car itself and not the product. A Prius has Velcro holding the current seat covers from the manufacturer on, which cannot be removed or tucked without the seat sticking in an upright position far too close and uncomfortable bunching up the large Velcro area under the seat back. The head rests went on fine in the front, but we had to make our own holes for the back headrests to be put on.  There is no opening for the seat belt holder itself to be used at all so, we left it covered.<br /><br />Putting the bra on so the seats could be split and one lay down- we did have a little problem with the zipper. It came apart, but we were able to fix it since we have the wheelchair in the car most of the time it was not an issue.<br /><br />Pros-<br />It looks good, much better than the seats that are 8 years old. It fits snugly and makes the car look more appealing compared to what it was.  The cushions for the seat belt I do admit are nice to have and you don't get that ride up where you have to constantly adjust the seat belt while driving or riding. It did not become displaced although after several uses you will notice a little bit wrinkled as we got in and out, or when groceries where taken in and out, I tried but it did not happen. Dog hair does not easily stick to the seats it is easily brushed away.<br /><br />Cons -<br />The instructions are terrible, minimal at the least. We had to decide how to put this on basically by ourselves with a great deal of &#34;oh that is what that is for&#34;. They do need to work on those it would cause less stress when two people are trying to work together, there was a whole lot of sweating going on. This material can only be stretched so much before it tears, if you have long fingernails I suggest you be very careful or you will tear this material.<br /><br />In conclusion, for the current price of this set I would buy it again at retail, but I would hope they had one that was specific to the hybrid cars like the Prius and take into account theoriginal seating can't be removed and add Velcro instead of the current elastic straps and hooks. There also needs to be a better instruction packet that comes with this set as there are far too many straps and hooks to know what to do with.original seating can't be removed and add Velcro instead of the current elastic straps and hooks.

B004ATQBJ6|5|These luxury add-ons are great! The application of the handles is idiot-proof, very simple and straightforward. The chrome handles give the car a touch of sophistication and appear is if they were always apart of the car to begin with. I recommend to any Nissan owner. The shipping was lightning fast. Great product.
B001CF1A7O|1|Lots of rust spots within 24 hours of use.
B0044FPNIG|5|This looks like a very strong bungee cord--should do the job well.
B000BQSYJ2|4|I bought this as some of my tool manufacturers recommend it.  Used in the air compressor environment with air tools of all sorts.  Helps keep your tools working better and longer.  Easy to apply.
B00J4UQCMW|5|2012 Subaru Outback 2.5i Premium Perfect fit, OEM can't be beat. Satisfied!
B0100WNVLM|4|Fit my Renegade very well and was easy to use. Only downfall so far is the little bit of whistle it gives off above 40 mph, but for this style of crossbar that is expected.
B0010DZZSI|5|Great
B01092IFZK|5|nice quality, had to do some fitting
B0012PHCO4|5|Fit well and rides much better since the originals were well worn out after 175000 miles.
B008I629TI|1|This will not bolt up to a 96 Suzuki intruder 1400 and has the wrong plugs
B004GFTC0E|5|This is the only way to restore headlights. Don't bother with any as-seen-on-tv junk or anything that doesn't require a drill.
B004LEO1DI|5|Just like the original on my trailer.  Used it on my deck to swing awning arm straight down. Worked fine.<br />..
B008O5KAOO|5|Works great
B00K36EB74|5|As described, soft and fluffy. Alittle lighter than the picture
B00B50NAN8|5|Excellent
B00BFDGOQK|5|Fits good on my 2009 Honda CR-V
B00KRH7MXO|1|Too small for my wheels even though it claimed it would fit... Overpriced for what it is
B004QXR63G|5|Received this item and from mail to instal took me about 2 minutes.  Easy to install and cutting it to size was just as easy.  Looks great and we couldn't be happier with the quality now we just have to see how long it will last!
B001O0HND2|5|Fit on an '05 Nissan Xterra, I recommend them.
B000Q0S10K|5|Parts Fit Perfectly !! Car Handles Awesome !! Along with this kit I also added Eibach Spring Kit and Koni Adjustable Struts and Shocks
B005MJCNNQ|4|nice item, but wasn't long enough for my 2002 mustang convertible
B00KV15JVI|5|Material and workmanship were first quality, much better than the original vinyl armrests. Unfortunately, this is not a job that most people can handle themselves. It requires removing the interior door panel and the armrests came with minimal instructions. I took my Honda CRV to a body shop. Our local Honda dealer did not want the job.
B0040MGZV2|5|Perfect fit.
B005CW9P2K|5|worked perfect
B000F3RYGA|5|I ordered two of these in one order and they came with the same key number. This means no searching for the correct key!
B000BQSL5E|4|Great product.  Hubby used large one to dry truck after washing.  Said it did a great job.  Anxious to try on house windows.
B00EO0RN5M|5|great replacement/price
B00T36TPEY|5|Installed by True Street Perfornance in McKinney TX, on a 2015 Cadillac ATS. Love the look, they dropped the car perfectly. Good combo with 19&#34; wheels!
B00XII6UKK|5|Looks great!
B00429NKWK|5|The dealership would have charged me $200 to clean my headlights. This $20 kit + 30 minutes is good enough for me. My before and after picture speaks for itself!
B011YNKWZO|5|Next day delivery and great quality
B004AE0DAY|5|This tail light assembly was an exact duplicate that even included the two inside bulbs.  Very satisfied for the price.
B0051D3MP6|1|This did not work. The Porsche one works beautifully. I depend on it. This one didn't. I went cheap and paid the price.
B0064RD47E|5|A great item.  I'm ordering another set.
B0002JN56A|5|Its been over a month now since I used this product and my mirror is still up. This product was a quick and easy solution that I would highly recommend to anyone!  Only advice I would give is to do the repair in the evening so the glue and primer have time to set over night .
B0016KG72I|5|Fits like a glove
B00Y7CCV7C|4|Worked just like they should. Looks great on the bike
B006WPABKG|3|Great
B0041TOW0U|5|Couldn't ask for a better product . Great price, fit perfectly and works great. Solved all of my problems.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Purchased to lock up rear wheel of my small 50cc scooter. Other 'D' style locks are no where near as wide or versatile. The lock mechanism is very sturdy and leaves me feeling confident when locking it and walking away Very sturdy and seems to be able to withstand as much abuse as any other lock I've bought, especially one of this size.<br /><br />Worth noting, the lock can be secured at any of about 12 different 'lock' positions, so it isn't necessary to have the full length of the lock used in the event your application wouldn't require something so long and bulky.
B00UMDQIE2|5|Fit perfect, but had hard time finding some screws to fit screw covers. If you have problems just go to local automotive store to find fit. Looks great on the Camaro
B00GRSOJSS|5|Great
B000GPRFNO|2|It is not the tip shown it is not the same color there is a large sticker on the barrel which is impossible to get off unless you boil it
B00JXYKJ5A|1|the plug connector did not make good electrical connection in my 2013 Chevy Camaro.
B00407X9WU|5|Exact color. Do not see the difference between new and older areas on the lower part of my car's doors.
B00NLMGVXY|5|Perfect fit for '11 CTS Coupe. So far it is keeping my paint protected in south Florida sun.
B0089KNC8A|1|Bought two keys for my 2002 f150 and they were too short and could not be cut for my truck.
B00RKHQY1K|5|The price was good, and it fits perfectly.
B003V9Y48G|5|works well
B000LKGCG0|5|Great bag for large ATV's. Fits nicely on the finder of the bike. Our Gas tank doesn't stick up far enough for the ones that fit around the top and hang down the sides. This is a Great alternative.
B0002JMF98|5|perfect
B008UF7YX8|4|this chain was perfect
B00GSAUHB8|5|I have purchased several different windshield sunshades over the years and this one by far is the very best. 1.) It covers the entire window. It's design fills in any and all spaces so it works very well as a privacy screen as well say when you are camping and have equipment stored in your car.<br />2.) No messy streaks left by suction cup marks. It stays in place with the pop open coils and your visors. No need to get saliva on your windows and/or have the suction cups loose their grip when the moisture dries. 3.) Very compact and easy to open, operate, repack and store. The one thing that made me think twice about initially ordering this product is because it was a pop up. I have not had much luck with pop ups in the past and have found them to be difficult to re compress. Not this item. It is very easy to open and re pack in it's own compact storage case. No larger than a dinner plate and paper thin. 4.) Complete UV blockage from the material used to make these. The material is very thin and lightweight but completely blacks out the light and is well constructed. Can't go wrong with this purchase.
B002T00RLQ|1|ez red updated these to a new style why i dont know , the old style was a real good set the new style looks heavy duty but they break super easy with very little pressure ive had to warranty mine every week since ive bought them and im no longer happy with this brand it looks to me as they took the tiawan cheap route and still charge us for the quality that is no longer present in this product i recommend saving yourself a headache and buying a set elsewhere gear wrench still has good products
B002092DWC|5|works fine arrived fast, helps with those battery's that don't have handles
B000C2SJ9A|5|Fit my 2008 F150 like the original part I replaced it with.
B00K56PPAY|4|doesn't fit my mazda 3 perfectly, but does the job
B00KPW9JVE|5|Awesome..Works great.
B0080IIET8|5|Good tool. Comes in handy.
B00FJMMSLI|5|Worked very well  would recommend if<br />You are looking for a backrest<br />Only one problem a little small concentrates<br />The support in one small area changed my<br />Seat to HD Hammack with backrest
B00INVEUP4|3|product as advertised... average quality... average price
B003L33KKK|5|It's keeping the oil nice and clean even after 1500miles.
B00916MMJG|4|Gave this carrier 4 stars for the same reason so many others did...it's a good product at a good price (I found it for about $50). Unlike others, I had no problem with directions, as I never got any with the product. A bit anxious about assembly, but after examining the pictures of the carrier on line again, I found it pretty easy to put it together. All the hardware and parts were there and all the holes lined up nicely(although any hardware would be easy to find/replace at any hardware store).<br />Agree with those who mounted the two main racks loosely, then fitted and tightened up the supports before going back and tightening the 8 bolts holding those racks in place (don't forget to fit the two cross pieces underneath when you do the supports or you'll have to go back for that afterwards).<br />Found the anti-sway interesting, but not usable on my truck, which has a larger Class V hitch and I must use an insert to mount 2&#34; units like this so neither the anti-sway or the pin can be used.<br />Most important thing is to take your time and don't overtighten the bolts. Again, as others have pointed out, this unit is not the heaviest gauge steel and if you overtighten, you will bend the frame. Just snug the bolts up. If you're worried that the lock washers won't hold, add some Loctite to the threads when you put it together.<br />Finally, not sure I would want to go any long distance with this unit loaded to it's stated max of 500 lbs, but as my Vespa is around 300 and dirt bikes are less, I think it's more than able to handle that load for the 100-200 mile trips I mostly take.
B00SA25KWI|2|This is the 2nd Universal Hood Scoop that I have purchased on Amazon. Although sold by different vendors the product is identical. Both Universal Hood Scoop's the vent screen falls out. The silicon that hold it in place within a few days is unable to withstand summer heat or the engines heat and begins to separate from the Hood Scoop.<br /><br />On the first Scoop I had to use a black 500 degree poxy and small about 1/2 inch flat tip screw driver to apply inside and outside on both sides of the screen, allowing set up time, prior to installing. It works for now.<br /><br />On the second Scoop the screen fell out inside the engine compartment and was mutilated by the fan, I am surprised that my belts received minimum damage.<br /><br />Even if you were not to use it functionally, the screen/billet will fall out. The silicon actually appears like hot glue from a glue gun.
B0047ECW56|4|Does the job. Silver fades to a copper color after awhile.
B003TU7L0U|4|Heavy duty noise isolation mat. Used one piece thus far on a skid plate that was reflecting engine noise from a thumper back. Easy to apply, and pull up if you mess up. Once pressed down, it is stuck. Really quieted down noise on engine. Next up, cabin of work truck with no insulation.
B0002SPC2G|2|Absorbed a lot of product. Sponges are much bigger than they appear. Was not a big fan
B000BUU5UO|5|The only TP we use in our motorhome (in which we live full time), because it's truly 2-ply and doesn't cause clogs!
B00L3K3OD6|5|I used these to replace the oem fog lights on my 2002 silverado and they are almost as bright as the headlights I have only had them for about a month so I can't say how long they work but for $60 you can't beat it I will buy again
B00IMPEWHM|2|I ordered these using the search function on the site, but these were the wrong size.
B0016KFY0O|2|The drivers side lens leaked after 1 week of service (4 days of boating).  I hope to get a new one under warranty.
B000RL5QCO|4|I wish it had galvanized or stainless fittings however it does work great and it makes it so much easier to put the boat on the trailer.  I have a 18' aluminum G3 which doesn't weigh much.  I'd go with a longer unit if you have a heavy boat.
B00CJ5DX9E|5|Worked like a charm on my 2004 Dodge 3500 truck.
B00029JDRU|4|The filter was just as advertised.
B00HNY10Y6|5|Great product. Came quickly. Exactly what I was looking for.
B00JBHY0PO|5|I like the colors. I also like that the package came with the seat belt cushions and a steering wheel cover! Dificult to get on if you know nothing about seat covers, but once they are on they stay in place really well! The videos they tell you to watch helped a lot! I like them. Also once I ordered them the package, it arrived before I could even think about it again after I ordered it!:)
B000EDOSS8|4|ok
B000182EV4|5|Excellent. Would do business again. Thanks for the great product.
B000F0E8FS|5|ok
B001CJHU9W|5|works well
B003WOZOUM|5|traveled from Florida to Ohio with this. We don't have the racks on top so it was perfect. The instructions were a bit unclear but we finally figured it out. It fit all of our clothes in it, so it was perfect.
B00VS3ET2I|4|Quick Delivery, quality product. It is just smaller and more fragile than I expected.
B000GV537S|4|This was exactly what I wanted to clear bigger tires.  The only issue was one hole on the rear bracket needed to be drilled out because it wasn't in line with the other holes. Simple to install took about an hour.
B000CGHR76|4|Its a great product. This mount seems to have more &#34;meat&#34; than the OEM Mount. It installs easy no modifications or adjustments. I noticed an immediate difference on deceleration and acceleration. where there used to be play when I got on and off the gas had seemed to improve. Im going to buy the rest of my mounts from DEA. Highly recommend. lets see how long they can hold up
B000C7XUMQ|5|My drivers seat would go forewords but no back! So I found this switch on Amazon purchased and installed now I'm back in the drivers seat<br />Easy to install and much cheaper then the Dealership.
B00AI6RV1M|5|good stuff!
B00E1JOQ6K|5|Looks great!
B007QV5JVQ|4|Good tool
B00652G4TS|4|Basic scanning functions nothing special. The connection time send really long sometimes but it works, clears and reads codes and you Vann see some live data
B001LHVOVK|5|Did what I needed it to do
B000EFLSGQ|4|These Springs Are Solid, And Were Easy To Install! My Car Rides Smoother And Handles Corners Alot Better.. Overall, Im Satisfied!
B00BYNJ90E|5|These shocks can actually adjust the ride hieght and they ride better than the factory shocks
B000CITTWA|3|Good enough, but needs a sturdier mounting system
B00FFXDTEQ|1|Had very high hopes but was extremely disappointed in this product. I purchased it last year and put it on my truck and was very pleased with the light output. About 6 months ago I started getting condensation in the light housing, even though they claimed it was water proof, but it still worked. It was never submerged in water, just drove through the usual rains. Just last week I turned it on and only 1/4 of the LEDs light up now. Hopefully they will stand behind their guarantee of it being water proof and replace it for me.
B00XAIN574|5|Good quality
B001413FRE|5|Great quality
B004LX1WHC|1|Panel not crystalline and do not buy
B003UT822G|5|Put this in my Tacoma and now oil changes are a snap...great for the DIYer in your family.
B003UW1IQU|5|Excellent quality polisher. The pads are great the only thing I wish the kit came with was a chart for what each pads grit/use is.
B006ISZDVE|5|Awesome!
B003O95MT8|5|seems just like OEM, wish I had bought the hitch package with the connector holding bracket.  I had to modify a curt bracket to make it work.
B00PJPHEBO|4|this thing is just a adapter it does nothing without the app but it works
B00BVB5HFA|5|The switch was easy to install and worked as expected. It's nice to go through a drive-thru and know the window will roll up.
B00EEEB77I|5|Great product.  Works perfectly and saves a huge amount of space over my towel in my workout bag.  Highly recommend.
B00DF8C25U|5|Easy to order and install.
B000BYEQZ0|3|It threaded cleanly to both the plug and block. I am not sure it helped at all, it runs rougher.
B00KTHYDA2|4|A bit too plasticky but works well.
B00QIQD05C|4|Works for quick disconnect for my travel trailer. However, one has anchored nuts the other came with standard nuts, also had to double up the ground wire as the clamping space is two wide for the cable.
B0039HEJKS|5|Fit my '99 Volvo S70 perfectly in place of my old solenoid. The plug was facing the opposite direction and I had to splice the wires, but everything fit how it was supposed to and functions correctly.
B006E0MS8M|5|Better than one!
B000QUTQ0E|5|Perfect fit on my 1996 Ford Taurus
B005NLQAHS|5|the thing i like about its cheap and i didn't  spend eighty bucks  for a  real one that takes up space . its great for used car hunting there's no wires it fits in the pocket and works with cellphone to see if its a good buy.  u can try different  ob2 apps u dont have to rely on their app they say. it looks cheap but its not . i also got the<br />Autel MaxiScan MS310 CAN Diagnostic Scan Tool.. to compare the two  items<br />they both are easy to use .
B0016KABFC|5|Nice winch for the price
B003BYFTMG|3|it's ok...it is nice but I hat how flimsy the top was made....why have a lock when it would easily gain access with a quick punch....I sat on it for just a second and it cracked....don't expect it to keep valuables safe and the lock only attracts attention to it so it will be gone through if a vehicle burg happens.
B007VR8ZBQ|5|Just look at the workmanship
B009M9YO6G|5|Awesome...can't argue with what the tag says.
B00D42AFS8|5|I bought this a while ago when Amazon had it as the &#34;Deal of the Day&#34; and threw it in the car, figuring it probably would never really be able to jump a dead battery, but at least I could use it to charge cellphones, etc., in a pinch. This morning my truck battery was completely dead. Honestly, I didn't even think to use the PowerAll... I forgot I even had it. So first I tried one of those cigarette lighter-to-cigarette lighter things and it didn't do anything... even with me letting it sit there for over an hour and then trying. Car wouldn't even turn over at all... just made a clicking sound. Then I remembered the PowerAll (though I wasn't even sure when I last charged it). Got it out of the trunk, hooked it to the battery, turned the key and VROOOM... truck started on first try! Amazing that such a small device can do that! The only negative comment I have to say about this device is that it's a bit hard to tell that it's on, and hard to figure out how to turn it off and on. 2016.07.11 UPDATE: This thing is incredible. This time I had a dead Harley motorcycle... seriously dead. Tried jumping it with my truck, with engine running. It would just barely turn over... about 3 times and then quit. At first I didn't even think of the PowerAll, cuz what could be better than a &#34;real&#34; jump with my truck. Luckily I finally *did* remember. Undid the jumper cables to the truck, hooked up the PowerAll, and started the bike... BOOM... instantly fired up, as if the bike had a brand new battery. My friends who were helping me with this, and myself, where all in shock. INCREDIBLE!
B00829I2ME|5|Fit and worked great on my 08 Is250. Aisin is the factory supplier for Toyota,  so this is a OEM pump for half the cost of dealer. It  even has a shiny ground down spot where the TOYOTA used to be. Highly recommend.
B00433SIQI|3|probably overpaid but it was helpful
B001O7HZPQ|5|Great
B00VB2OJ1C|5|Perfect fit
B000E5S4ZO|5|Sounds fantastic. The only reason I purchased it. I can't confirm whether it actually increased HP or not.
B00PJK9MQY|2|The stem caps came loose in a bubble wrap envelope. One was crushed, I was able to superglue it back together and it worked. I told the seller about and they wanted me to send them pictures of it. It wasn't worth my time for such a cheap item. The other one won't turn off (sometimes) unless I flick it after I stop.
B000FGLQCK|5|Purchased this for my 2015 Kia Forte. It is placed in the back seat in the floor in the middle and fits nicely. It held my daughter's drinks on a very long drive and compensates for the lack of cupholders available in the back seat. Great price and nice solution for what we needed!
B00YNNAZ00|5|Fit great look great
B002T07C82|5|I got just what I wanted. Thanks!
B00ITNLD4W|2|Like this brush scrubber for the wheels very much. But after a little while the flexible metal spine poked though the end and would have scrathed the hell out of everything. Have some other brushs replace this. The microfiber thing is still good I use it for something (engine detail?).
B00BI4K4I0|5|Got a set of these in the mail today for my 08 chevy silverado 1500! Already put one side on with no struggle they went on just fine trimmed them up to fit right on! Found a video on youtube of a guy putting them on a dodge car and followed his instructions and the job went smoothly for putting them on for the first time ever! Gonna put the other side on tomorrow since its gettin dark and the bugs are out hopefully itll go as good as the first one! INSTRUCTION VIDEO LINK: http://youtu.be/C0WfJvw7cgw
B000C9Q2RO|4|Well, it is hard to tell how good they are as I just put them up today however they fit my 2001 Honda Civic Coupe perfectly. They are cut on the side to allow to slide them on the sway bar which makes installation easier. In order to install them you have to jack up the car then crawl under. Each bushing is held with a curved plate and 2 bolts.<br /><br />You will have to remove completely the 2 bolts on one and loosen the 2 others in order to keep the bar up and replace the bushing more easily. Make sure to notice the direction they are pointing. For me, the cut was pointing the front of the car. Also they fit, they were a bit smaller than the one I had installed.<br /><br />I made sure to do the following:<br /><br />1) clean up the sway bar and bushing<br />2) put some silicone grease inside the bushing and inside the curved bracket<br />3) put some anti-seize on the bolts<br />4) snug everything back<br /><br />We'll see how long they last but so far they are quiet and seems to do the job.
B00K36QPCS|5|perfect fit
B00OCIBPIM|5|My fifth floor jack; and the best value--especially the safety pin.  Only wished the saddle swiveled.
B001DRP9VE|5|It fit to my car but I haven't use yet
B000GU24HG|1|Absolute waste of money.  Soon as any wind comes no matter how slight, this cover will tear.  Do not buy this cover it is horrible.
B001O0TZ56|5|Used these pads before.  I think there the best quality pad for the money.  No issues to report.
B0031ZDU62|5|This worked great
B001A553WE|5|Works great and will mount on almost any vehicle.
B00D8DR0AO|5|Great product I would recommend it anytime, I had used a similar product made by Turtle wax but I found out later on after I couldn't find it at the stores that they had discontinued it we have terrible drought in California and Optimum No rinse is very obvious the solution to preserving water. My neighbors saw me washing my cars and they took note of what I am using and now they want to get it for themselves, I washed two cars with the same water and it was less than two gallons of water. The seller was very efficient and I got the product sooner than what I was expecting.
B008VIJNDS|5|Installed on 2015 Iron 883. You don't need to take anything apart to install. Just unscrew the stock bolt and the washer comes off with it. Then wrap this new bolt with blue tape where the socket will touch it and then use blue loctite liquid on the threads of this new part. Torque the new part down according to the harley service manual specs. Make sure to know the difference between ft lbs and in lbs in torque settings.
B00K2MYPY8|5|This light is the perfect size and style for my camper van.  However the halogen bulb gets really hot.  I would like to replace it with a led but I don't know what bulb to get and how to remove the light cover.
B0093XZDS4|5|I put this in my 43 year old (GM Crusader) engines on my boat and they have not run this well in 20 years.  Not sure BestLine is the reason, but I'm  using this product from now on.  Also put it in my BMW recently and will see if it makes a difference.
B008DUUA7C|5|Dealer wanted 275$ for the same part a bit over the top i thought.  Works great for me. I only saved 265$.
B005FK3P8O|5|Nice rotors for the price. I am happy with them.
B0013FFPX8|3|The knob we received was a knob for a newer GM radio instead of the one in the photo for our older GM radio and doesn't 100% match in looks with the rest of the knobs. Unless one looks, it is not that noticeable so not much of a foul. But the knob does fit and completes the task at hand. Plus the price is far better than what a GM dealers parts department wants.<br /><br />Just ensure you are getting the knob you desire, otherwise we would recommended this product on price point alone.<br /><br />We were not paid nor discounted in any way, shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others. We believe, as a family, it is important to give an honest and accurate review to assist others so they can make good purchasing decisions that can benefit them and their family. And not be lead to cheap, unwanted purchases that are scripted by advertisers to buy their products. We are a family that believes in a minimalist lifestyle while trying to be green as much as possible in all departments of our life.
B0009IQZFM|5|Excellent product,you can't go wrong with this.
B00KTIAREM|5|This item worked well, and the instructions were  easy to follow.
B00KXHH20Q|1|Do not fit 2004 f4i they're junk
B004HE554Q|1|ok funcionan bien.
B00WVDE0SW|5|Fits perfect. Looks very well constructed. Like the fact I can wash, rinse and reuse. Helps to reduce waste.
B000VU7E1M|4|Was able to change the regulator without removing the alternator (1987 944s). Quality of construction was not quite as good as the OEM component that was removed but it was a lot cheaper.
B00HLK77YO|5|Great!
B00ASY7HJA|4|Looks and works great.
B000CPCC4A|5|Works fine for connecting my trailer turn lights.
B0002SRGXY|5|Sweeeet! Works as advertised, wish I had it years ago.
B000CFS02S|4|Works good besides hard to get airline lined up good
B008KODBO0|5|Not just anyone can or will try to program an after market key. But I called around and found a locksmith that would , so 30 seconds and  $75. Iater i had a key that would work.
B0064SEBPC|5|good
B00PSRORH2|5|Looks great and easy to install.  I have a F150 Supercrew cab.
B00BXUMNME|5|Just what I wanted
B001C9S5S2|5|Engine mount works well and was easy to install. Quality part.
B000C18Q3A|5|Great lights, fast shipping to Sweden
B00383MIQA|5|Bought this for use on the stern of my 1996 Yamaha Waveblaster 1 and it is the connecting point for the tie-down. If you use any other part of the unit to tie the watercraft down to the trailer like the seat, the deck, the craft's towing cleat, or the grab handles, then you are not only doing it incorrectly, but are setting yourself up for unnecessary damage and/or excess wear to your Waverunner. You need to use a special locking pin which I don't see on Amazon at the moment (8/2015) or I would link it, and then combine that with a 3-point tie down (they sell it at Overtons). This bow eye is a quality item and I have used them in all of my PWCs that can adapt to them over the plastic ones that come OEM. They are strong, and they look amazing.
B005KQ48KW|4|Replaced old case didn't cut the key just swapped the case
B00GBSCSQE|5|great for tool storage, fits HD and lowes buckets
B005BNYY26|5|Correct fit, on time delivery, issues.
B006ZNPZ8I|3|It works as described
B00TQZTN6W|5|Bought it for my wife's car since she does not have veteran plates.. she loves it!
B0074CTD00|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  It keeps my purse from falling to the car floor.  There is no need to move the net when I have a passenger -- they don't even know it is there.  The only thing I would change is to make it completely black so it would virtually disappear in my black interior.  Without the grey binding, it would be invisible, which I would prefer.
B004SFRX30|5|Great part Denso compressor all good
B00CXAEDEO|5|I got what I paid for works great
B000BZJN5W|5|perfect !!!! and a price better than any part store around me .
B00DHGEVTK|1|Didnt fit, poor quality.
B001J7K2VK|4|I've tried several brands of dash pads. This is the only one I've used that hasn't deteriorated. It isn't the stickiest but it has proven over months of useage that it is safe for wood as well as the dashboard of a car. Another brand of dash pad I used on wood surfaces deteriorated resulting in the the pad permanently bonding to the surface of wood. These probably aren't intended for use on wood so shame on me if I used these incorrectly. Regardless, they make great anti-slip water proof surfaces for phones, tablets, books and even beverage containers (glasses, mugs, cans..) in the house and for phones or other items on the dash of cars.
B00VM4ON56|5|Very nice light. Much brighter than I expected it to be for the price! I would definitely recommended it to anyone looking for a small light for an atv.
B005GYA6FY|5|great store
B006P89DXQ|5|Looks good on my leather.
B004GC8DPC|5|It fits properly and works.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Used for a 1500 mile round trip on my Highlander.Carried the camping equipment etc leaving a lot more space for passengers and luggage.Also bought a zip up cargo bag to fit and a cargo net,but three long bungie cords are easier to use and give quick access.Easy to bolt together,very solid,gave me no problems,no rattles etc.Will use for moving garden mulch or other bulky items to the house,i can store in the garage by hanging on the wall or support it and use as a shelf for the camping gear until next trip.Very useful piece of equipment.
B00NYHH0NQ|5|Beautiful and fits well. It was easy to install.
B000MVTKRG|3|Bought it for a 2003 Ford Ranger and the bar is solid, not like my old one that was 2 pieces, so when installing you can not put in the middle of the access placement, for the spare tire access hole to lower the spare tire would be covered, so looking for a different bar made for this truck, The amazon page showed that it did fit this truck, sorry not correctly though.
B004PSZ85A|5|Does the job and they are strong
B00OV31UEM|4|Looks great installed. So glad I did not need to drill holes in my bumper or permanently install license plate. Removes in seconds for clean show car appearance. Only issue was when installing it was near impossible to get it level. It had a slight but very noticeable slant that was not acceptable. My simple fix was Velcro straps used as shims under the high side of mounting bracket. Easy fix and now looks great.
B003V3PZIK|5|Everything you need. Used on my Bimmer, gave it the showroom shine it deserves. The clay bar is especially helpful. Will continue to use these.
B00GBRA3J4|5|Awesome product.
B005DO9BQM|5|Once again - Perfect!
B006N88IWU|4|Item is as described.
B00BCZJEOA|5|Nice fit.
B00I8BWCNG|5|AWESOME all the around!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|the product was easy to install and doesn't make any noise when driving on highways. no complaints
B00EECL95U|5|I LOVE THEM AND I THINK YOU WILL TOO...
B002FSIY5I|4|Beautiful rotor - but it is marked as fitting my 2010 Cooper and it does NOT - it is too large in diameter. There should be something in the descriptor stating it fits 294mm rotors, NOT 280mm rotors...
B000BWE4M2|4|Great deal for the money looks good
B00PXH81CE|4|Look great but a bit loose in the wheel. A bit of black vinyl tape fixed the problem
B007LICL56|3|Loveeee the bling fasteners however my second set i bought for my front plate screws were to small and the diamond fell off of one.  So 3 stars out of five for fast delivery the next day and for my first set for my back plates was beautiful.  Thanks
B01103ARL2|5|Arrived as expected, easy to put on.  Looks good.
B001DCEMQM|5|great
B00CX4KTJS|5|A great battery! I never heard my car crank up this fast, she sounds amazing!
B007WR25ES|4|It worked great for my family needs since the rental agency didn't give us a van as requested. Since new cars are made for 7 passengers but only enough room to haul 4 overnight bags. I don't know what the other 3 passengers are suppose to do
B012HHJ7OS|4|It is a snug fit on a 2008 Nissan Titan LE, with the plastic adapter with the smallest hole.  The problem is that the Knob does not fully go down the shaft, so a little bit of the screw part of the shaft shows, I have to look for a cover to make it look nice, this knobg is designed for a shifter with a cover on the bottom already.  The good news is that the knob sits much higher and makes for much easier shifts.
B002692308|5|What a deal! Fit perfectly. Very inexpensive.
B00XZV6O38|5|Love them!  They fit nicely and look sporty.
B00DGGHR3S|1|Part did not fit my Infinity G35. It was curved too much and did not fit flush to the trunk.
B00M28MO3O|4|Quite good but it's abit hard to Installed!
B00BJNTLGG|5|Fits my 2003 Hyundai Tiburon 2.7L GT.<br /><br />Replacing my canister fixed the following problems :<br /><br />-  Difficult to fill tank at gas station<br />-  Gas odor after fill up<br /><br />Canister is located directly under the spare tire near the rear of the car.<br />Upon removal of the bad canister, I noticed the charcoal pellets easily fell out of the canister.<br />On the new canister, the pellets cannot be poured out, proving the canister is faulty.
B001BK24UM|4|It works
B00S77QUMK|5|They fit great and have stayed on during strong winds
B004BHCEES|5|Easy to find my key love it. Gift from my husband  when I bought my car
B00U868BN4|5|Excellent product,really takes care of unwanted odors in your vehicle (Great air purifier..Thank you
B00IFV6Z3M|5|Sounds awesome but not too loud
B00QU7R30W|5|vvery good condιтιon nвrandnew
B00P80G0S8|5|Same quality and construction as the more expense FRAM. In fact it was identical to the FRAM filter. I think the same manufacturer is supplying both Luber-finer and FRAM.
B000R5G0DO|5|Love it! Purchased it to check the transmission pressures on my 88 monte carlo SS. Fittings were 100% and no problems or leaks whats so ever.
B001ARNN0G|5|Received my stuff quick and clean
B000O03FVM|3|Came in an open package. As far as i know the part could have been used. It did however work.
B005NLQAHS|4|like it
B000RFUYQI|5|Exactly what i needed for working on my rusty old car.
B000N9JE1Y|4|great product, with some minor flaws.  don't let your buddy raise & lower it.  he might accidentally unscrew the lens & drop it in the river. you cannot buy a replacement lens, you have to buy the whole fixture... the lens unscrews with just a slight turn.  the light swivels 180 degrees with notches all in between, so it can point down, up, & many places in between.  i swapped out the crappy incandescent bulb for an LED bulb, it was expensive, like $20 or something, but it is brighter, & won't burn out, or have the little wire in it get broke from rough water or vibrations.  i kept the original fixture that was on my boat, & just used the lens.  the boat has been on saltwater for at least the past 5 years, & the fixture works great still.  i did remove the lens & coat the metal with dielectric grease when i got the boat, & i make sure to keep all the metal coated with fresh grease so it will not rust out.  if you leave the light in the down position, it will fill up with water.  if you drill a hole in the top, then you have the same problem in the up position.  they should have sealed the lens to where no water can get in but left a vent so it will not fill with condensation, i guess a strategically placed hole in the fixture couldn't be implemented into the molding (idiots).  anyway, it's a good product.  overpriced, but &#34;fair market value&#34; so can't blame them for that.
B00F92YCXA|5|works good
B000CONUBU|5|All good
B000GU0P4A|4|It works well.
B012L7X9JI|5|This works great. One issue the screw they provide is not as strong as the anchor it is trying to manipulate. I had to go to Lowes get the correct screw and finish the job. Other than that this was a great buy!!!
B00EKMHH2I|5|Excellent light for my mustang and can
B00N707WKG|5|It was a perfect fit
B00JRE38EA|4|Very bright, too long did not fit inside the marker light on the top and side my class a rv, I end up use these light for all storage bins light, still searching for something shorter than 12 mm or 1/2
B0096FSDTA|2|it must have had a crack I could not see because it just shattered in to shards after about a week. It's a shame because I liked it and it was kind of fun to spin.
B007DPI0AM|5|Awesome
B00ZHOQIR8|5|Perfect color match for my car.
B00D9C2CDO|3|Returned, wasn't what we were expecting
B002P8EMGI|5|Great valve caps for cars and bikes. We have a couple of 'extra' cars that these caps are perfect for. They are a little lightweight, but not a problem.
B00TRF6BCU|5|delivery was prompt @shaft was same as original.
B0061R3D78|5|They are what was advertised.
B004ZF35GM|5|Great product. Recommend to anyone.
B007ISGIOE|5|I will be honest I didn't buy this off Amazon I purchased this K&N at Auto zone but I wanted to write a review on how I fell about this product.I absolutely love the way this makes my car sound! It no longer sounds like a Infiniti. It gives the car more of a nice rumble to it. I have noticed a slight increase from 0-60. I haven't really noticed a increase on my MPG though. The only downfall I found was that the instructions kinda sucked.The hardest part was fully connecting the air sensor all the way in to the air tube. I found it really easy to disconnect the sensor and getting a microfiber on the back on the sensor and pushing it really hard with your Palm of your hand. The last pic is the Air sensor all the way in to show you guys that it does fit. It just takes some muscle to put it in. I took some pics of how this looks in my car so everyone has an idea on how this would look like. Hope this review helps if so give me a thumbs up so I know it helps you guys out.

B00YBFU75S|5|After being an RV owner for 9 years, I finally had a great shower! This product was easy to set up, just 5 minutes and the power is amazing.  RV Manufacturers should include this shower head in all their models.  Owners will feel the difference.
B005CCJ25K|5|They are really bright for their size.. I wish their were brighter that is why I am going to purchase the 10 in E series combo flood/spot..
B00JXA9AGS|5|Showed up super quick. Quality is good. Install was pretty painless and the lights look pretty awesome. Installed on a 2015 Yamaha raptor 700, some splicing involved, pretty simple though.
B00HUM54EI|5|A perfect fit and great on sunny days. I appreciated the shade from the moment I opened the package.
B0101EP6BM|5|So far this product has been awesome!!! The light is very bright and performs flawless... After using it on the trails you can't imagine trail riding without it.
B00008RW9U|5|Great auto accessory. Picks up dust like nothing else. Great price when using Amazon Prime with the free shipping. Be sure to place the duster on newspaper for a few days to absorb some of the dust pickup material from the duster. Keep my 2015 Corvette looking great. I highly recommend this  &#34;original&#34; California Duster.
B000SL4AA2|5|I use this every few weeks to maintain proper auto tire pressure. Still going strong after 3 years. I just looked into the digital type, but decided I'd better play it safe and just keep using this one. The cons are that it tends to bounce around when running, and I lose some air trying to get it secured to the tire valve. But I use a digital gauge to check the pressure before and after, which I would need to do at any rate. So I'm pleased with this one and do recommend it.
B000B5QFE4|5|They work great
B008JPV6ME|5|Easy to install great price.
B002T4SF20|5|very good quality. has been very useful on my kingquad for 2 years now. one bit of advice, I learned the hard way. don't over tighten u bolts. will collapse your frame.

B003ZIL1NE|3|I have sent many e-mails/messages to Anzo with no response to my problem. My LED light set, AnzoUSA 321210 Red/Clear LED Taillight for Dodge Challenger - 3 Piece , has developed a hyperflash in the right rear light set-up. How do I fix this issue? I think the resistor box may be defective. Where do I get a replacement?
B00JMJP41K|3|Fits perfect, but received 2 silver and 2 gold trim....would be nice if all were the same.
B00008RW9U|5|Love it. Like they say the dirtier the better. Always use it on my motor home. Makes the wheels clean up really nice & easy. &#34;Happy Trails&#34;.
B007I5B6PS|5|Great kit. Easy to install and luckily I live about 10 miles from the place that produces these so mine arrived in a day

B00Q5HXQ9O|5|I am very short and have been sitting on a thin cushion to help me see the road better.  I recently developed pain in one of my hips when I sit for more than about 40 minutes, especially when I am driving.  My physical therapist put towels under my cushion to change the angle so it is higher in the back.  That  relieved the pain, but the towels and the cushion had to be re-positioned every time I got into the car, and sometimes I got it positioned properly and sometimes I didn't.  I purchased the Driving Comfort Cushion because of the wedge shape, the strap that holds it in place, and the description of the materials. Yesterday I used it on a trip to a destination 100 miles away, going down and back on the same day, so I spent over 4 hours sitting.  About an hour into the drive, I had to stop and put a towel under the back of the cushion because it wasn't enough of an angle and my hip started hurting.  However, that one adjustment was successful, and because the strap holds both the cushion and the towel under it in place, I didn't have to re-position every time I got into the car.  My hip didn't hurt the rest of the way down, or on the drive back.  The cushion is firm, so it gives good support, and it is very comfortable.  So I am pleased with this purchase.
B00E59KLXS|5|Like the original one,,,
B00F5WZWSI|5|Awesome
B002PQU6YC|2|Compatible but not original
B00GUD2WH0|5|great
B00K1C1WC2|5|What you see is what you get
B004RFT3KM|5|works very well. saves time and fingers
B000OO10AG|4|Loved them . But depending on how high your boots go . They might not work for you.  (The fox brand boots go to your knee almost so these dont work with them.  Great product double strap is nice.
B007OW6MD6|5|They're gaskets. What more can I say...
B003CK5UZU|5|Exactly as advertized, and all balls quality
B00JKU640Q|5|they also never make the news. I bought this for my 7 year old Goddaughter to remind her to always be a badass!
B00IALJ566|2|Totally disappointed it lasted 6 months, and worst of all is that Amazon website show that it fit my vehicle 6 months later it shows that it did not fit.  Try the warranty but there is no way to contact the company. Stay away from Moog!!
B003TTL0TE|5|The Chemical Guys are my go to for wash products - I haven't had a complaint yet on all the stuff I have bought.
B00N6D7G5A|5|high quality brass I can finally flush my engine in the drive way. thought I would never find one.
B0039KU6ZW|4|Takes a while to deliver, but cheaper than they are at my local dealership. My set came with all 4 floormats and the anchors to hold them in place.
B00ANZHG4U|3|These are small like the ones from Costco much better
B000GOHUZI|2|Well it beats no air but it is not like an OEM much lower air output.
B000IYT158|5|Locking gas cap. Works well. Great quality. Keys are not flimsy stamped steel. Worth the cost.
B000C2SBG6|4|I have always like the quality of Gates belts and hoses. I was very surprised that the hose did not have the internal spring to prevent collapsing.
B006N91C2M|5|Battery worked perfect. Saved a LOT of money buysing this and installing over the dealerships prices and even a lot cheaper than the local stores.
B002EP0ZHW|5|Fit perfect. Be careful, when Amazon says it fits your vehicle they are not always right.  This was my second attempt at getting the correct cable.  Had problems with other vehicle specific orders as well.  I suggest you do a close visual check and use the questions option.  An example is the serpentine belt I returned for a different vehicle; I received a belt too short for mine with a/c compressor, ordering process did not differentiate.  Good luck.
B00G0OUGSG|5|Easy to install works great.  Shipped fast no problems
B003TAB6Q0|5|Great!
B00A23V5EU|5|The pump has been great.
