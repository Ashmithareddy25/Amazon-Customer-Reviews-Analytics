B001NLKXK2|5|Great story, very touching. Have the tissues ready...
B003JTHXOK|5|even though we all know exactly where each of these books are heading their still an easy enjoyable read start to finish.
B00PTB7B34|5|This the best game ever
B008XG1X18|5|Love it.
B00CSR2J9I|5|This game is awesome I have it on my I pod and I really wanted it to be on my kindle and finally it's on here !!!:)&hellip;
B0083Z614S|5|I really enjoyed reading this book
B0095ZMMCK|5|Great series.  Love Clancy.
B00687Q0VC|5|It made the Revolutionary War and the people that suffered through it to a victorious end come to life.  Giamati is stunning as he brings you along side of Adams'  struggles, his battles to steer wisely and his head strong passion for honesty.  John Adams has become a new hero of mine because of his portrayal .  Brilliant directing and editing.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007IQX9ZW|1|Don't waste your time, movie was horrible! There is absolutely no redeeming quality about this movie, find something better to do!
0399255370|5|Wonderful book, great story, adorable pictures...my Kindergartner and I loved it!
B008JFUNJQ|5|Fantastic
0440238609|2|I heard many good things about this series of books.  And it is well written. But it is too preachy and zealot anti religion for my taste.  Others may like it more than I did.
B0064MPXFA|5|Love the cast and the story!
0553502077|2|I think that John Grisham must be getting tired - this book is the most boring one  and I have read all of his novels - I  kept waiting for it to get interesting and it never happened. The only thing I learned was how to move money around the world - that is if I ever get any money to move around the world! The characters were never developed and the final thought on this one was &quot;who cares&quot;
B000QRIGLC|3|I tremendously admire and respect the job and role played by U.S Special Forces and especially the Navy SEALS. I had followed original news reports of the incident and survival of this SEAL. I was curious about the details of the incident, especially after seeing the movie. I had seen films of the training regimen of the SEALs and the text gave a good reprise of that process. While I respect Marcus Luttrell's patriotism, I would question some of his views about the rules of engagement required of the services. I know these ROI restrict and may endanger U.S personnel in some instances, but there is long term strategy behind them. I admire and salute Marcus Luttrell for his excellent service to our nation, and wish him long life and prosperity.
B00006I53S|3|First, I should point out I'm an amatuer. This is my first lens for my Canon Rebel XTI. I purchased this lens on Amazon over a year ago, and although I have no other lens to compare this to - I am dissapointed. Here's why:     - I read a few reviews indicating that this lens could be your \\"only\\" lens - good for all purpose. I have to disagree. I am often frustrated by the limited 135MM range. Especially for landscape shots. Now, if I knew how to crop/ photoshop/ etc., perhaps this wouldn't be as big an issue for me. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a telephoto lens with 300MM range and purchased the basic lens that came with the Xti for short-range photos.     - I was warned that the lens was heavy, but I thought hey - I'm 6'3, pretty strong - no big deal. However, now I wish I had gone with a lighter lens. The lens is heavy and makes carrying around your camera all day a little less appealing. For a casual photographer who wants good shots, I have to imagine there is a decent quality lighter lens out there for less money (however, I admit I have no idea yet if that's true!).     - I find that about 20% of my shots are a bit blurry. I attribute this to being an amatuer, but I never had this problem with less sophisticated \\"point-and-shoot\\" cameras. Is it possible I'm doing something wrong?? Probably. But again, I'm writing this as an amatuer, so if you're like me, perhaps there's a better lens out there (or maybe not - I'll have to try another one and find out!)    In summary, although I have no major complaints with this lens, I was dissapointed after reading all the glowing reviews. I am now considering purchasing the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens OR the 70-200mm f/4L IS USM Autofocus Lens. I plan on trying them both out at a local camera store before purchasing - especially since I want to make sure I get \\"enough zoom\\" in my next lens.     Good luck with your purchase!
B004ZMWUCU|5|I am not much on romantic novels, but this one is written wonderfully, it's sly humor is enchanting and it's characters endearing.
B001UTW7QU|5|It was great!  I can't believe I didn't watch it when it first came out.  My brother recommended it to me and now I can't wait to start Season 2.  If you were ever a fan of the X-Files.......you will love Fringe!
B006PHD0RW|5|I thought this games was really thought through before being put on the app store. I never have problems with it. its cute. its just awesome.
B006ID6NDQ|4|Great quick read.
B00N9MQBKY|4|Excellent album!
B000TGCR38|3|Black Book has gorgeous photography, brilliant costuming, fine performances and good writing.  Unfortunately, much of this is squandered on a preposterous story line.  How could anyone over ten take this story seriously?  Let's take just a few of the more outrageous examples.  The evil doctor heading the Dutch resistance group is constantly in the midst of fire fights rife with automatic weapons fire, yet we are supposed to think, what?  That the German soldiers somehow know he's on their side and miss him?  The Germans in Holland are relaxed and happy in April of 1945, even throwing a luxurious party to mark Hitler's birthday.  I guarantee the Germans were doing no such things in Holland in April of 1945.  They were scrambling to get anything they could in preparation to high-tailing it back to Germany first chance.  A Canadian officer allows the SS to execute one of their own officers AFTER the war is over with live ammunition issued to German soldiers.  Seriously??!!!  There are more examples, plus the myriad implausible twists and turns.    I did enjoy the film and will praise Verhoeven on the many things done well.  It's a shame he felt the need to be so over the top with his story line.
014062029X|5|One of Hardy's best novels. The characterisation are excellent and the descriptive writing is superb. I recommend it highly.
B00FRQ32N4|5|I love this game it's just like the movie
B00AATV046|5|One of our favorite Christmas movies from long, long ago.  New format will replace our ratty VHS tape.
B00886XQO0|1|When I first used them they were AWESOME, but that didn't last.  They worked for a one hour game and then after that they started with the crackle and pop sounds, which seemed caused by certain colors or effects in the game, or they'd cut out completely.  Customer service told me they needed to be reset and re-paired.  I followed their directions and it still wasn't fixed.  Self troubleshooting, I replaced the optical audio cable with RCAs and this made them usable for about a day.  Then the crackle and pop started getting worse again.  I said screw it, went and bought some cheap X12s, and these are going back.
B0094K1WZE|4|Solid.
0141301155|5|This book is excellent. It combines fantasy with reality and day to day morals. A great read!
B00005QDW1|5|No Doubt's latest offering ROCK STEADY is a bit of a departure from their other albums. As a fan, you either love it, or you don't. This fan here loves it. The album has a more electronica feel, with a few more beats and texturized sounds. No Doubt worked with a variety of producers on this album, namely William Orbit, Nellee Hooper, Prince, etc. The result is a fun party album which has a variety of music styles, including reggae, ska, pop, and more. To me the biggest standout of the album is the Prince produced track &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, which is an irresistible song to listen to, very catchy, hopefully it will be released as a single. Other great songs include &quot;Running&quot;, which features compelling vocals by Gwen, some of her best, &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Underneath it All&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. Not for everyone, but its a nice move and overall a great album. Give it a try.
0812550706|5|I have read a lot of Science Fiction books, and I believe that this genre is one of the best (You get insight on the human mind through experimenting with extreme circumstances).  Anyway, I was going to read this book for awhile, but never thought it would interest me.  I heard it was amazing, but never wanted to read it.  One day I decided to pick it up, and the rest is history.  This book was intelligent, thought-provoking, and fast-paced.  It told of people going through extreme challenges and how they delt with that.  It was great, I don't want to give anything away, but if you like science fiction you have to read this book.
B004ZY0VHY|3|It wasn't the easiest book to read. For the first time ever, I preferred the movie. It was okay though.
B0083ZRAJS|4|The story of Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz is one that almost everyone knows by heart. The movie has been a classic Thanksgiving staple since long before I was born and continues to be shown to this day. However with the addition of new books and movies to the old Canon the classic book has fallen into obscurity. Though the movies have the same flavor they all lack the true richness of the story of the first in L. Frank Baum's twelve book long series. The book is written in a classic fairy tail style that is easy and quick to read and providers multitudes of delightful lessons and allegories to the observant reader. Highly recommended to those who delight in fable and fairy tales and, of course, for children.
B000TERJK6|5|Bill Conti wrote a masterpiece soundtrack here, and the soundtrack is so capturing of the asmbiance in the film. A blockbuster movie with one of the greatest soundtracks ever done for film
B005MLOKXA|5|I love the personalities and relationships of all the characters - there's always a surprise, or something being revealed about a character.
630575067X|4|This movie is great. It has fantasic special effects.  The storyline and actors are weaker than those of the trilogy.  How ever it is enjoyable. I would only recomend it to those who don't expect it to be a movie with alot  of character development and a big star wars fan.
B000QCUB8I|5|this has not left position # 1 in my car changer ... esp # 6,8, and 9 amazing way better than Daft Punk and hey, thats a stretch for me to say after ALL of the years I loved them till Robot Rock, ugh!<br /><br />Justice, amazing!
B008JGSM6G|5|starts simple and progresses to test your reasoning...fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B006O3MU96|5|I don't know what else to say. I was unsure at first about the app but when I started playing I was instantly hooked. this game is simple and wonderful but most of all simply addictive.
B004HWT6DO|4|Good movie. Vos Brothers were really screwed!
0790729644|5|great price and fast shipping  thanks
B007VYDFMS|5|A Legend's story told well. Gave me a perspective I didn't have about him and learned a few things about him too.
B000023VR6|1|After a week or even less i could no longer listen to this album..at the beginning i thought how great it was, but now i even zap when there are clips of da dr on TV becos its getting sooo boring after a short period of  time...its incredible...i can only recommend u to NOT buy this album...what  did happen to DRE?
B00FRQ32N4|4|This app is pretty good. It's annoying how you have to spend money to progress. when i first got this game I had to reinstall it because the ads kept popping up at the start screen. Overall, it's a good game with good graphics.
B00471TLZS|4|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Good early work by Speilberg.
B0050N8N0Q|1|I didn't give it any stars because I didn't want it and don't like it even tho I had to pay for it.
B00RNRD8RA|3|Not great, but I must admit it was entertaining and I laughed out loud more than I expected. Franco was especially hilarious.
B00GLP47UM|5|I LOVE FROZEN!!!! IT IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE AND REALLY CUTE SONGS!!!!!! I will listen to this a lot.
B0052UZIFA|5|A fun game, nice graphics, witty &quot;story.&quot; More fun than other puzzle-like games I've tried. Works great on my evo 4g.
B00GQQ77IU|4|Fast paced basically true to the book
B002E0JL4A|5|Hey it has Robin Williams in it - I absolutely adored him.  Enough said.  Very funny.
B00SB2OYL0|5|Adorable movie, finally one for the entire family.
B001BANK32|5|I had forgotten how good the book is since I've only read it once before & have been watching the movie more often. I mean, it's Stephen King. Of course it's a great story, but it's the way *he* tells it. I wanted to re-read this because I had just read Doctor Sleep (which is the story of &#34;Danny&#34; all grown up). Now I'm just glad I took the opp to re-read &#34;Shining&#34;. Love King's way of telling a story & this is one of the best. (No matter how hard I tried though, I couldn't *not* see Jack Nicholson as the dad! LOL)
B001CTGQBK|5|One of my all time favorites!!!! Now my daughter is in love with Danny Zucko too! She wants to go to a singing high school! And it's a million times better than High School Musical!
B006GLLXXK|5|I love true blood with all my heart
B0002ZDVEU|5|the first was good, but im not sure why, i just thought it seemed to mainstream hollywood, and the fight scenes weren't that great. but the camera work in this is genius. it adds a whole new level to the film and gives it a much more cool, exciting, and intriuging style. the direction and editing is great, the first really seems like more of a set up than a movie, but now, now we have the REAL film hopefully a third is on the way, and with any luck, they wont listen to all these stupid b*stards saying that the direction is dumb, or that the hand held camera was a bad idea. the best thing about this is that [probably since it was very rushed during production] it seems very fast and gritty. this is my kinda action flick.
0486415856|5|Mansfield Park was my least favorite Austen book until subsequent readings. Fanny is not your typical Austen heroine but she grows on you. She isn't a funny and witty or beautiful character but she is honest and upright and caring. Now I love her! The quality of this really inexpensive book was very pleasing as well. It's in way better condition than I thought it would be. Can't wait to order more classics from Dover Thrift!
B0042U94UQ|5|It seems like we received this almost the next day. The movie is a hit, everyone really likes it - even the kids!
B001KDQ4KQ|5|Amazing novel. Very close to my heart and very emotional. Keeps you wanting to read more. Like the unexpected twists to many of the relationships throughout the book.
B00ILHW6AG|3|I read the entire book in two days, so it definitely keeps you engaged.  I won't spoil anything for people reading the review, but I expected more from the ending.  The whole book is engaging and suspenseful and then the end just doesn't do the rest of the book justice.
B00K9V2OPE|5|Good book-kept my interest the whole time.
B00K7C17QW|5|Love the crime solving aspect of this hidden object game. Also like the fact that you can play without spending REAL money as long as you can wait until your energy bank refills.
B00BEJL6Q8|3|Slow & dark filming
B001RJEHO8|5|I don't know, I'm not a huge audiophile but this is one of those ones where the original media format makes the experience somehow. Seems to generally apply to glam-rock and underground rock, but to the second side of Ziggy Stardust more than anything else I've found. Also play it as loud as you possibly can!
0698115635|5|Children have loved listening to me read this book to them for years. Over and over and over again, we read this book. &#34;Today is Monday, today is monday....&#34; I know this book by heart by now. They also know it by heart as well. They enjoy the sing-song melody of the words and the colorful illustrations. I usually read this at bedtime because they choose this book for reading at bed time.
B000MX7V5M|3|I wasn't too impressed with this film. I am usually a fan of Care Grant, but this movie didn't move me that much.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Best game ever for me
B005ZOBNOI|5|I love it so much. Sad but extremely meaningful. I became attached to the characters and cries a little. I definitely recommend it!!
B007D2XSW0|1|First of all why would they put a camera app in the kindle fire appstore? The fire doesnt even have a camera! The only thing you can do is take pictures from your gallery to decorate. Plus when i turned it on it froze! i tried to get to the home page but nothing worked. I  finally had to restart my kindle. but when i restarted the kindle the app was still on the screen! i had to call the kindle fire customer service so they could fix it. but they charged me 50 DOLLARS!!! this app can ruin your kindle so beware! unless you have money to blow do not get this app!!?
B006885LZM|5|Excellent depiction of the war with Japan.  Focus is on stories from real people that had this experience.  I have new respect for these men and the situation at the time.
B00992CF6W|4|I've always loved minecraft for a while now,but this new update isn't so great. The nether doesn't work anymore and every time I join a server with my friends, it doubles everything in my inventory. And some things are invisible too. The breeding thing with the animals do work though. Please fix it soon! :)
B006ZAZ31U|5|This is one of the best books I have had the privilege to ever read about our American heroes! I look forward to watching the documentary. I will put this family in my daily prayers and encourage everyone I can to read it.
B00EMXBDMA|3|Engaging, mixing science and expansion survival adventure (outer space is a lot like the early west) in an informal style. The blog style of main character makes an easy entre to space technology, the interludes of 3rd person pov with more characters and interchange either back at NASA,  or among the original  Mars travel crew gives it some depth and texture.  Mark Watney, alone on Mars, is clever, interesting,  suspenseful, a little technical, and almost repetitive without the shifting focus.  I was surprised  by  a discussion with some other readers about there being a slightly sexist viewpoint- and really, would this industry not be slightly sexist in terms of women in the field, or a slight male ( nerdy male) fantasy element when discussing women? I'm ok with it, and actually find the  casual language, and  revealing remarks make this book  authentic, and also make me wish for a bit more character development and a good editor. What does happen to a book  with a self published online success- is there an editor on hand to grow the novel? All in all - Not great literature, still a fun smart read,almost a beach read, although this beach is Mars.
B00F4ID7JE|3|Very enjoyable.
B00JP5ONY0|5|Loved this movie! Had substance and meaning to it in a subtle way...was funny and sad, really well done! Acting was complex and moving. Highly recommend it!
B0069G5Z9K|5|This game is very fun and adictive once you get into it.
030745455X|5|After reading the first book in this trilogy, I was completely hooked.  The second book provided much more action and excitement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I found it to be easier to read.  I highly recommend this book, and I also recommend this seller.
B004OEIL5O|4|nice item. price is good. couldnt have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.
B00BP4WAZS|5|I think this would be appealing to anyone at any age.  We really enjoyed this great family movie.  At one point the video game world had us craving gum drops.
B000002C1W|4|Besides &quot;Ummagumma&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; this is probably the most disrespected album that Pink Floyd ever produced.  The critics hated it because Roger Waters left, and Floyd were trying to figure out how to continue without sounding empty (like they had to completely reinvent themselves after Syd Barret descended into hallucinations and living like a hermit).  Occasionally, this album sounds tragically 80's, but what can you do?  There are, however, really great songs on this album, such as Learning to Fly, Dogs of War (am I the only one who likes that song?), One Slip, On the Turning Away, and one of the top ten Floyd songs of all time, Sorrow.  That song alone is worth the price of the CD.  But that's just my opinion. Buy it yourself and see what you think.
B003ZSJ212|5|All movies looked great in Hi-Def.
159420411X|4|requires some knowledge of statistics and math theory. the proposed idea of the bayesian theory appropo to the thesis. maybe decrease the total number of different topics..
B0099Y2MYK|5|could hardly wait to see now waiting for No. 4, I have enjoyed all the series. I also have my daughters and grandaughters interested. they too caint wait for various serious
B00ALYY6ZA|4|Very well written. Information presented in an informal manner. Appreciated the case studies and the authors' personal experiences. Can't wait to start the 5:2.
0064471837|5|I don't normally read too much fantasy/sci-fi books unless I'm familiar with a series or author. When I got Sabriel, though, I knew right away that it was one of those few sci-fi's that can actually keep me interested the whole way. The plot is very intriguing, and the characters can be both serious and hillarious at the same time. Somehow, Garth Nix has managed to create a magical, yet realistic world filled with suspence, romance, and action. It was this book that inspired me to become a fan of Nix, making him one of my favorite writers of all time.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Other than the foul language this book was one of the best reads in a long time. I loved the humor, the science,and the involvement you felt.  Can not wait to see the movie a d read anything else Andy Weir writes
B00JDMY58Y|5|Beautiful!
B000Q6GUTI|2|Great for a 14 year old boy...... Anyone else it is nerve riding... Very predictable. Marky Mark does look great in a white feather outfit in the end.... Save your money and see it on TV.
B0058A11AK|5|What is there to say about Barbra she is the Queen of vocalists no one comes near her, Im just glad my life has run parallel with hers.
B00J4ZTAFI|5|Great twist on an old classic
B00821OX98|5|Good
0345803485|4|I read the first book and swore i wouldn't read the 2nd much less the 3rd, but you really have to read the 2nd then the 3rd........I liked it, but still not sure why, she keeps repeating certain phrases over and over again, not the greatest writing, but, obviously there is something about these books that make so many people read them .....it's a mystery, but totally easy, light reading.
B0036EH3X4|5|The DVDs came in a brand new box and in excellent condition. Good deal for me.
144937980X|5|Great book with easy to follow examples.    Perfect size for an easy chair with a glass of white(or red) wine.    Some books are just more fun than others and this is one of the fun ones.    ENJOY!!!
B009UX2YAC|2|Good app like temple run its kind off the same thing but I think subway surfers is better so I give it a 2
B0039TD7PY|4|This was pretty damn good.  Mellow music is not usually my top choice for listening pleasure, but I have always like Carole King, and James Taylor.  They look and sound good together here.  It was an intimate performance, and very enjoyable.
B005C8ENI0|4|McConaughey is good in this type of role. No oscar, of course. But, good for this role, and a good story. The mental games the two main characters play as the story progresses definitely keeps it fun and interesting.
B005SEYOXW|5|Of all the shows that were prematurely cancelled, this has to be the best one out there. I think this show would still be going strong if it had not been cancelled.
B0063IH60K|5|When I am waiting on an appointment or something I enjoy playing solitaire. You can pick it up where you left off and the game keeps track. I have played this game a lot.
9889979942|5|I'll just state that this book should be used in all American schools as a personal introduction to China, or -- as the author explains -- \\"the 33 provinces of the fourth largest country in the world,\\" which includes \\"56 different ethnicities, each with their own languages, customs and lifestyles.\\"<br /><br />CHINA: Portrait Of A People is an amazing book. No less remarkable for its unpretentiousness. The author and photographer, Tom Carter, is no crusty academic, and what he provides here is a personal (and personable) view: a voyager's log in part and what is essentially a superior example of guerrilla photojournalism. The book is divided into 33 chapters, one for each province, and before each chapter are his recollections of his difficulties traveling to the regions as well as episodes where Chinese individuals (see \\"I, Shen Mei Li,\\" page 134) are allowed to speak for themselves, as well as fragments of poetry and other uniquely Chinese related material -- just enough to wet the appetite for the remarkable images -- some gritty, some even grotesque -- you are about to see.<br /><br />Favorite images, sections? Hard to pick since there are so many. The photo-illustrated journey starts at Beijing ('the epicenter of the \\"center of the world,''' as Tom Carter writes) and concludes with Tibet (\\"Middle of nowhere, center of everywhere\\"). With more than 600 pages in between. (The images in this final section -- Tibet -- are among the most emotionally compelling and beautiful of the book.)<br /><br />With a country as vast as China (and one as culturally and historically ancient), there's a lot to see and Tom Carter provides a vast array of images and views -- glimpses of a country on the cusp of a sweeping transformation: a great nation that still identifies as Communist while embracing new Capitalist ways. These photos then also provide historical artifacts as modernization plows away thousands of years of history.<br /><br />The scope of this book is epic, yet broken down into satisfying sections. So it's user friendly. And again I would mention that the book's lack of pretension and self-conscious artiness lends it a down-to-earth charm. It's like a pilgrim's account of China experienced first hand and shared in photographs. And I found myself fascinated by certain details (the \\"hair salon girls,\\" pgs. 28,169, 331 and the \\"double lucky\\" eyelids/cosmetic procedure), among other things.<br /><br />Of the places I'd like to visit on account of this book, top of the list would be Tibet and places like the Portuguese-influenced Macau, and of course Beijing (\\"Chaoyang\\"). Then: remote Heilongjiang (\\"Harbin\\"), Inner Mongolia (which is one of the most beautiful sections of the book), coastal Shandong (birthplace of Confucius), Jiangsu (with its sad and bloody history of Japanese invasion), Fujian, Guangdong (\\"Dapu\\"), of course Hong Kong (for its urban, multi-cultural variety), Guangxi ( \\"Zhongliu\\"), Guizhou (\\"Zengchong\\"), Anhui (\\"Mukeng Zhuhai,\\" the Bamboo Sea where Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was shot), Hunan (\\"Zhangjiajie\\" and \\"Fenghaung\\"), Henan (\\"Song Shan\\" for its 800-year-old Shaolin temple and its ancient association with Kung Fu), Shaabxu (\\"Xi'an\\" for the Bingmayong vault), Gansu (\\"Hexi\\" and \\"Langmusi\\" for its Tibetan yet almost Peruvian-appearing culture), Sichuan (\\"Jiuzhaigou\\" and \\"Emei Shan\\"), Yunnan (\\"Lijiang\\"), and once again Tibet (particularly \\"Lhasa\\").<br /><br />Need I say more? For the world traveler and romantic in us all, this book will infect you with<br />enthusiasm, excitement, and curiosity for a place. And I can think of no higher praise for a book.<br /><br />CHINA: Portrait Of A People by Tom Carter. Highly recommended.So it's user friendly.

B005IT0V8O|5|William Strunk and E.B. White's inexpensive book of excellent advice for workers with words. Includes tips as simple as \\"omit needless words\\" and reminds readers about usage, such as the difference between 'lie' and 'lay'. Well worth rereading in almost any edition!
B000X1Z0BU|5|When I picked up this movie, I was under the impression that it would be a typical love story that my boyfriend would hate - aka 'chick flick'. This was SO not the case. It's more a story of a love of music and where that can lead two people. I was highly impressed with this film and it's documentary style. If you are a music lover, I recommend this film. You won't be disappointed.

B00005JNQ8|3|The point of \\"The Interpreter\\" seems to be that in a civilized world one should always drop the machine gun and rather use diplomacy and the UN. Now, if we could just convince our president to do that. Anyways, I found this to be a powerful movie that sneaks up on you. I found myself feeling underwhelmed for the first hour or so, only to be completely enthralled by the time the credits rolled. This film, which lives and dies with its storytelling ability, overcomes many of the pratfalls of the political thriller to tell a powerful story.  In most political thrillers the director takes us to a land of make believe where really important people are replaced by people who they tell us are important.  By avoiding this you can avoid character development of the villains (see \\"All the Presidents Men\\" and while not a political thriller a film nonetheless \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\"). This film contains the make believe land of Motobo, and with the filmmakers not wanting to name names it sort of neuters the film. That is not to say the movie is totally apolitical, UN strife, suicide bombers, and terrorism are things born out of our recent political past.  The film revolves around a Motoban citizen who now works in the UN named Sylvia (Nicole Kidman) who hears about a assassination plot that is to be executed inside the UN. Sean Penn and Catherine Keener are the people the government sends to investigate the threat (playing quintessential Sean Penn and Catherine Keener characters).  From there people's pasts are examined, and Sylvia is thrust into the middle of Motoban's political upheaval. There are at least 3 very good suspense scenes that were impressive to me. I could have done without the romance between Kidman and Penn. I know some girls out there will only show up for any movie if they think there is a possibility that the climax will involve a wedding in a park. However, and I don't know about you, when I'm knee deep in Motoban politics I don't have time for anything else. I also enjoyed the connections this film had to my real life. Oren's Daily Roast (my employer) was represented in the form of three coffee cups. Also, when the bus blows up, it blows up on Nostrand Ave. in Brooklyn, the same street that I live on. Those things aside, this is a very enjoyable movie. ***1/2lso enjoyed the connections this film had to my real life. Oren's Daily Roast (my employer) was represented in the form of three coffee cups.

B000H6SXMY|1|I was very upset when I bought this! I'm only up to season 7 and half the disk don't even want to play in my dvd player. The packaging was horrible, they come in a flip like book in plastic sleeves and the package with Rachel on the cover was unglued from the back cover. The disk look like they are illegal copies passed off as new. Around the center there are glue marks and finger prints. I contacted the seller (dusteeshane) and was told that they were really sorry but they bought it off someone else so they had no idea if they were illegal copies or real. No refund was offered even. I'm looking at re-buying the series but am scared to do so now from anyone now not just amazon. Thinking about buying the seasons one at a time but not sure how to store them.

B00G32VYDG|3|I'll get right to the irritating bits:<br />- stock cop gets whacked by his partner, seeks revenge plot line<br />- effects were uninspired. The 'deados' were animated terribly as bloated cartoon characters, all of them with terrible, saturday morning cartoon quality voice acting too.<br />- the big action scene at the end went from chaotic to boring to ultimately pointless.<br /><br />It's not an awful movie, and there are some funny one liners in there, but it's nothing special.
B00COHIFQS|3|Thought this movie was enjoyable, but nothing amazing. I didn't find the movie to be scary at all but more of a thrill/ fantasy. The story was one thing I liked most about this movie, I kept me engaged and I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The visuals was what I thought was disappointing, awhile ago I saw the body movement test done by the actor and thought this was going to be a sick movie, but there was alot of cgi parts that I thought killed the horror aspects of it. Overall its a movie I enjoyed watching but would only watch once.

B00025G2K0|4|A taut, clever tale brimming with backstory, 2003's \\"The Avenger\\" is a nice return to form for Frederick Forsyth, recalling if not attaining his \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" peak and showing there's life in the old boy yet.<br /><br />Attorney Calvin Dexter lives quietly and alone in Pennsylvania after the deaths of his daughter and his wife. Unknown to everyone else, he leads a second life as self-styled \\"Avenger\\" for hire, calling upon skills honed as a tunnel rat in Vietnam to help other grieving families achieve closure by bringing those who have hurt them to justice. He needs all those skills when he takes on ex-Serbian paramilitary boss Zoran Zilic, whose Bond-villain name comes with a coastal fortress Blofeld might call home.<br /><br />Reading Forsyth of late has been a disappointing experience for me; I picked up this book not knowing what to expect. \\"Icon\\" and \\"Fist Of God,\\" his previous two novels, started strong only to peter out, hobbled by excessive exposition and plots that unfolded too neatly, drained of suspense. \\"Avenger\\" has a lot of exposition, and a neat wrap-up, yet it actually works very well this time, in part because Forsyth's writing has tightened and also because he has a real story to tell, one that resonates in the same way as his early classics.<br /><br />The plot is engaging like \\"Jackal\\" because you don't quite know what the protagonist is up to. In \\"Avenger,\\" like \\"Jackal,\\" you are given a lead character operating alone and in secret, the differences being that Calvin Dexter is a sympathetic figure and known to you by name. We spend a good deal of time seeing Dexter in the time before his current life began, including a terrific sequence explaining the whole Tunnel Rat idea. A bit more exposition than needed, perhaps, especially when we travel to Dunkirk in 1940, but that's Forsyth's style, something his fans enjoy and others should allow for.<br /><br />When the book begins to take off, however, it really soars, especially when the CIA gets involved. Zilic, see, is no ordinary exiled baddie, but one who has connections in the global underworld. And there's one man in particular who, as August turns into September of 2001, that CIA counter-terrorism boss Paul Devereaux would like Zilic's help in eliminating.<br /><br />Devereaux is a complicated figure. He'd be the villain in almost anyone else's book, no question, as he works to keep Zilic safe. But Forsyth is wrestling with the problem of how to fight evil in today's world, and poses the question to the reader in an interesting way. This gives \\"Avenger\\" a kind of twist that makes it special in the Forsyth canon. Does the end justify the means? Is it better to leave Zilic to prey on his dozens of innocent victims to stop someone else from preying on hundreds of thousands?<br /><br />Forsyth doesn't present any easy answers, just a tough story that keeps you reading. Dexter's confrontation with Zilic feels rushed, and it seems Forsyth could have done more with it than he did. Like the whole Avenger identity, you don't exactly buy it, but you enjoy it just the same. It's easy work enjoying Forsyth this time around, and hopefully there's more to come as Forsyth rediscovers the balance between giving history lessons and a ripping good yarn.inary exiled baddie, but one who has connections in the global underworld.

B00069YE0W|5|For anyone who can appreciate warmth in music, this album is for them. The guy who wrote that really crappy review was obviously an idiot. I mean, music is a matter of personal taste and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don't like it then why come on here and write a really harsh review? You're clearly a struggling human who can't deal with genius when faced with it. go back to your fu**ed up musical ideal and your 'raw' performances. raw is a word. music is emotion and you clearly lack that. stop being such a synical f**k-witt. try and feel something for once instead of judging people and their own personal efforts at beauty. if i heard u'r music i may not like it. but i'd still commend you for your efforts at making a beautiful piece of art... something that you and others really appreciate. the bottom line is... critics are useless, they serve no purpose. they do nothing for everybody and you are doing just that. go and listen to what makes you happy and stay there quietly. you don't deserve to have a musical opinion if you can't appreciate all kinds of music.
B000UR9T7I|5|good movie
B000FCKGPC|4|What I did like about this book was it still left me wanting to keep turning the pages until I was done.<br />I think this series is amazing and can't wait to start book 5
0553801473|2|The title about sums it up.  The book was alright, I don't forsee myself rereading it like I did the others.<br />Some spoilers<br /><br />I picked up the series just as AFFC came out, not realizing it would be a 7 book series.  Devoured the first four books (I even liked book 4, despite many people not) and recommended it to all my friends.  They also immensely enjoyed it and we all eagerly awaited book 5, which kept getting delayed and delayed and delayed.<br /><br />I knew this book would not live up to 6 years of expectations and I wasn't really expecting it to.  But I was still surprised how far off the mark it was.<br /><br />The most disappointing things<br /><br />1) Lack of editing.  The first four books seemed to be somewhat well constructed, at least compared to this.  I found numerous typos.  Additionally, the use of certain catchphrases (s)he was not wrong, words are wind, little and less, much and more, reek reek rhymes with etc. are repeated so much that they actually ruin the immersion.  Add to that the pages upon pages of excessive description of things totally irrelevant to the story, food, side character descriptions etc and you have a whole lot of catchphrase, description, catchphrase, description segments that really break the flow of the story.<br /><br />2) Plot lines going nowhere.  Basically as said in many reviews, nothing actually happened in this book.  Sure a lot of pointless stuff happened, but almost none of it will have an effect on the overall storyline.  The actual things that did happen in the plot line are mostly useless as well.  As an example: Aegon Targaryen the child of Rhaegar found, which would mean he is the rightful heir to the throne not Dany, yet she has a dozen or so chapters and he has none.<br /><br />3) Ridiculous character perspective disparity.  There are too many Tyrion, Dany, Jon parts in this book, which coincidentally are probably the least interesting perspectives.  Bran, Asha, Davos, Arya have a couple.  Rickon has 0, Cersei 2, Jamie 1, Mellisandre 1.  The other books had great balance and I didn't find myself saying oh not a Tyrion, Dany, Jon part again.<br /><br />Overall there was just nothing special about this book.  If you are invested in the series already then I would wait for the Library rush to be over and get it from there.on has 0, Cersei 2, Jamie 1, Mellisandre 1.

B005QYKE2Y|5|You know going in what you are going to get with a Michael Bay flick....lots of explosions and copious hot chick butt shots. You certainly get that here. However, it does seem like he has taken the criticisms from the last two movies (and part 2 in particular) to heart. In this movie, you dont get lost in the combat scenes, for example. Also, where he went more Wild West for the battles, in this movie, the Transformers use more martial arts and medieval knight styles in the combat sequences. It worked quite well.<br />Emotionally, there was also more a draw in this movie. The comedic scenes were plentiful, and i laughed often throughout the movie. Also, when Ironhide dies, and when Bumblebee gets captured, you cant help but get a little choked up.<br />Megan Fox's replacement was equally hot, so no drop off there.<br /><br />...and, much like the cartoons, while Megatron is a bad ass as a rule, he has moments where he seems quite frail. If you remember the old cartoons, there were moments of cowardice for him. Here, there arent, but there are moments of weakness.<br /><br />I dont understand all the negative reviews here really. If you are expecting an oscar worthy movie, you shouldnt be watching this to begin with. If, however, you go in just expecting a fun and fast romp, i dont see how you could be disappointed. Also, for now at least, the reviews for the DVD. Blue Ray, and Rentals are all being thrown together. So...read a few before you make a decision. They arent reviewing the same things.

B003ZSJ212|2|No in-depth interviews, let alone ANY new interviews from the core ORIGINAL cast? - NO!  No return of the approximate 7 minutes that was released during New Hopes very first limited release? - NOPE  No original versions of the first 3 films prior to the \\"special\\" edition debacle? - NEGATIVE GHOST RIDER!    ... Than I am not going to buy these just to get  RICK ROLLED!  Grrrr....    PS - Rick Rolled is a term you can google for when you think your going to see one thing and you in fact are forced to watch something completely different!  ...like a Rick Astley video.  PSS - Yes, if you were old enough to see Star Wars on the limited release, prior to full nationwide release AND remember there were deleted scenes - than you know what I am talking about.  If not, than after some google research you will find that I am not the only one, and Lucas has said in the past those will not be released.  If you find old kids picture/story books, you may find one with pictures from deleted scenes like when Luke, in the first of New Hope, actually does go into town and meets newly graduated x-wing pilot Wedge and talks about the rebels!    [**update** I have been informed that this scene I am speaking of is, for the first time, \\"IS\\" being released in this set. For that reason I am changing my rating from 1 star to 2 stars.  That kind of childhood vindication that I saw a \\"different\\" version the very first time, as a child, is worth it. ....now if only I could see the original versions we are predominantly speaking of...that would be another review entirely! My final thought still stands, considering the many decades this took and my over all point...]    But who am I to ask for such things?  OH, I dont know maybe part of the generation that has payed hard earned money to line George Lucas pockets for life.  Phewww, whatever, hope I dont ever meet him in person.

B00SI7GCJK|5|EXCELLENT MOVIE !!!
0316228532|5|... and Bob's your uncle in J.K. Rowling's new universe.<br /><br />I really loved this book. It's true, there's no magic in it. Instead there's drug addiction, child abuse and neglect, and a variety of sexual misbehavior. But the voice is unmistakably J.K. Rowling's, and that woman sure knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />Just as the Harry Potter series fit into classic English genre -- two of them, actually, the boarding school novel and the fantasy novel -- \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is written in the tradition of the English village novel, which encompasses writers from George Eliot and Anthony Trollope on through Joanna Trollope and Helen Simonson of \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand.\\" And there's a little of \\"Major Pettigrew\\" in this novel -- which also features village prejudice against Britons of south Asian descent -- but the south Asians in question are a lot less saintly than Major Pettigrew's Mrs. Ali. No one in this book is a saint, in fact, with the possible exception of the character who dies in the first chapter, creating the casual vacancy of the title. Imagine a world where Harry Potter is killed halfway into the fight against Voldemort, and you've more or less got the set-up.<br /><br />So, yeah, every character in this book is deeply flawed, but few are outright villains. Everyone's life is more or less grim, but everyone also dreams of something better. The big question is whether they'll be able to do anything about it, for themselves or for others. Like the Harry Potter series, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is ultimately about life's big moral questions -- but it's written so entertainingly that you don't quite realize it till the end.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this book down -- I read it over a weekend, and I would have finished much faster if it hadn't been a really busy weekend. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Eliot's \\"Middlemarch,\\" but without the boring parts. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews; if you're a fan of big, chewy novelsand you like Rowling's writing style, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />ETA: I see that a lot of the one-star reviews come from folks who are shocked and dismayed that there is profanity in this book. Yes, people, this is a novel for adults. If seeing the F-word in print sends you straight to your fainting couch, you'll probably want to skip this one.

0375842381|5|You will find that these books provide a fast paced journey with fantastic creatures, characters and plot development. There is a good flow to the writing and it will keep you turning pages whether you're 15 or 25. The polarization of reviews to be found are religious in backing. You won't find a one star rating from someone based on the story or the prose, but on their distaste for any themes they find against their own dogma. The story does attack tyranny and religious domination. A snippet from the book: \\"I met an angel: a female angel.. She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\" Its really a sum of that; independence and critical thought over suppression, dogma and dominion.<br /><br />Lyra and Will are the two heroes of the series. Each has an instrument that provides them some fantastic power. The books are filled with parallel worlds and various other entities borrowed from theoretical physics. If you are looking for science fiction and fantasy mixed stories in marvelous settings with plots to keep you jumping, this is a good bet.

B00C7JGDBW|5|It's a daunting task for any director to tackle the world of L. Frank Baum in light of the masterful 1939 version of &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;.  With a few references to that film director Sam Raimi puts his own stamp on that place somewhere over the rainbow.  This film acts as a prequel of sorts with the story of how a charlatan magician named Oscar Diggs(James Franco) became the Great and Powerful in the time before Dorothy Gale's red ruby slippers trod the yellow brick road to the Emerald City.  The main plot concerns a power play between the forces of the Good Witch (Michelle Williams) and the not so good witches (Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis) for control of Oz and how they're using Oscar for their devices.  Good backstory and terrific characterization and performances.  The visuals are eye-popping but they don't overwhelm the narrative.  I wish I saw this on Blu Ray or better yet in a theatre where you get to experience the richness of the details.  A terrific film no more intense for the young 'uns  than the original.
B00IRISI42|5|This book was filled with intrigue, espionage, family all intertwined in this unforgettable novel. A pleasure to read. The plot was perfection. John Puller did not disappoint and this should be a must read for all Baldacci fans. His best yet!
0143034901|5|I stumbled across this book in a Barnes and Nobles in a desperate search for a book that could awaken all my senses!<br />When I first saw it, it's blood red cover and elusive plastic wrapping caught my attention. I chuckled over the unnecessary presentation. The cover was simple a Z made from dark books with two small figures at the bottom that appeared to be a man and his son.<br />I quickly grabbed it after reading it's poor attempt to sound illusive and prayed I'd found a winner. Boy did I ever! This book intrigued me from start to finish! Now on to read the rest of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's books!
B003L16FAE|1|Do not buy it. Get an older barebones 2008 edition instead. The person who supervised the transfer for this new Ultimate Hunter Edition should be fired for complete incompetence.
B005FRF6PC|5|I am a tennis nut and I have watched Rafael Nadal for the last decade. I have always been amazed at how ferocious he is on the courts and how humble he is everywhere else. This book goes a long way in explaining both sides of Rafa. I also like the way it's written. Alternating between autobiography and biography, we see the EPIC 2008 Wimbledon finals as a microcosm of Rafa's life through his eyes, and we see the whole of Rafa's life as written by John Carlin in alternating chapters.
B0071XO8RA|5|It has been a long time since a book had me on the edge of my seat! I felt all the emotional and physical highs and lows of the characters. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
0446608955|5|this was the sweetest book i have ever read, be ready to laugh and cry.  A walk to remember is a sweet love story with turmiol and heartache but i loved it
B008EKOO46|5|Diamond set expectations for his work astronomically high with Guns, Germs and Steel. Which, for laymen like myself, utterly disrupted my understanding of the world and the human condition. The World Until Yesterday meets that expectation admirably and raises the bar yet higher as a companion piece. Since reading GG&S I have been unable to see the world as I had before, and again with TWUY, the world is filled with renewed wonder and curiosity.<br /><br />As a footnote, it's not that I didn't enjoy Collapse - it's just that I started reading it in 2007 - so I won't be finished for another week or two.<br /><br />BW
B00BVYNSLC|5|This was a pleasant surprise. Solid acting and a curious plot.
B000E1ZBGS|1|I was SO glad I didn't see this dreadful movie in the cinemas.  I don't understand is why on earth anyone would try to improve on an already masterful adaptation (even with it's flaws) of this beloved novel.  The A & E version is the very best do date. <br /> <br />Keira Knightly was about as believable as I would be in this role. Her acting is stiff and her facial features (what is up with her mouth?) are too distracting. Matthew Macfadyen is so wooden and doesn't betray any feeling towards Knightly.  There isn't any real tension or chemistry between them. <br /> <br />You can skip this movie.
B00HYTNBU6|4|Fascinating!  Touching!  Left me feeling helpless,  Robert Redford at his BEST!  The boat rolling in the sea made me wish I had a lifesaver. Great special effects and cinematography!!!
B001BFFTO0|3|I bought these boots expecting typical Timberland quality, however I was disappointed by the craftsmanship of the boots. The tongue of the boot is a two part stitched design, and within a few weeks it started to come apart.<br /><br />I had them replaced, and it was obvious that quality control on this line of boots is poor. The new boots have a tongue that is easily half the thickness of the previous pair. It is almost paper thin!<br /><br />It is a shame the boot suffers from poor craftsmanship because it is a beautiful looking boot and feels good on the feet.<br /><br />For those who remain undaunted by my comments - please note that these boots run very large. Get a 1/2 or full size smaller than you would normally wear.<br /><br />In closing, nice looking boot and terrible craftsmanship.
B00IMZ2PNK|5|I really enjoyed the movie, the special effects are awesome.  The movie was well done . definitely I recommend it.
B00I442CYQ|5|Probably the most informative book I've ever read on Hitler's true ideology and a true understanding from his own words on what made him custom built for the times he lived in. Though I do not agree with his ways by understanding history at the time I can see a puzzle piece that fit very well in the shape of post world war 1 .
B0070Y46UY|4|I borrowed this book from the library by looking at the cover and thinking I could really enjoy a good adventure story.  Something light and nothing that I had to think about much.  Just a fun book.  None of that happened.  None.  I almost took the book back after about 35 pages.  The intent of the book was murky and it didn't seem to be going anywhere I wanted to go.  I had just read a book about current the economic structure of America by a Nobel Prize author, \\"The Price of Inequality\\".  It was good but it was not light reading.  I was not prepared for a lengthy discussion of religion and the various branches of religion.  But I got into the rhythm of the story and by 50 pages I was hooked.  This has been called a simple story and I do not agree.  It is a masterful, even elegant, tiered tale that is played out in a small volume of space.  The thoughts and ideas, the issues and the adaptations are rich and dense.<br /><br />I make a connection with two movies.  12 Angry Men, and Lifeboat by Alfred Hitchcock.  Both are about critical survival issues played out in a small, sometimes claustrophobic setting.  Both highlight the way essential decisions are made and how we use natural talents and whatever comes to hand to meet needs.  All three end with an unexpected trust.<br /><br />I liked this small story.  I have just bought the book because it will be read more than once.
B00LZXOI5E|5|Do it. Just do it.
B007P6VM04|5|Good one!
B00BAXFECK|5|I bought this because it won the Pulitzer.  I didn't expect to be sucked into the story and walk around the house with my nose in my Kindle until I was finished.  It's a great read and the writing is &#34;yummy&#34; - language as art.  When I saw  that the author was from Mississippi, I was not surprised.  Southern authors are the best.
B004HWYTP4|5|RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) was quite funny, fast paced and tender.  We really enjoyed this movie - the acting was excellent.
B004I8WD6E|4|Flimsy and gets dirty easily.
B00OMLRSPI|1|great effects story sucked
038553826X|4|The last few Discworld books were not very good.  This latest installment is an improvement although its still below average for the series.  Its another Moist van Lipwig book, which generally entails introducing an aspect of the modern world into Discworld.  In this case its trains.  The antagonists are set in their ways dwarves, i.e. fundamentalists.  Of course, a conflict arises between the two.  Much like a train, the story chugs along and doesn't deviate off track.  Even more than the prior Moist novels, it is the new invention, the train, that is the star of the story.  There isn't much in new character development.  Moist is already fleshed out and doesn't really change while the secondary characters don't stand out.  However, the book recaptures some of the charm and energy that was absent from the past few volumes.  Fans of Discworld and particularly the other Moist books won't be disappointed. Just don't start the series here.
B009FZFONO|5|While this show is not for everyone, it certainly has something for everyone. This show is the purest form of e-crack out there, and it is wicked awesome.
B0096NCVAE|5|Lego fun for Halloween. 5 year old put together easily!
B0000TB050|4|FINALLY!  Music DVD producers are getting the formula right - Widescreen 16:9 and DTS!!!!  That's what they should ALL be.  PERIOD!<br />O.K., with that said...this is a very nice package.  I got mine from Best Buy for $15.99.  The redone &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; documentary is worth the price of admission alone.<br />The audio is very good (not stellar).  Very hot mix.  About the same dB level at &quot;55&quot; volume on my system as others at &quot;60&quot; volume.
B00BFUUMO8|5|Well thought out. Great time killer. You don't have to send requests or pay money to play it through fully.
B009VIZDLI|5|I absolutely loved this book.<br />Beautifully written, hilariously funny, wonderful ending.<br />A perfect read. I encourage everyone to read it.
B00AREIAI8|5|In my opinion this is a good game. I got it for my daughter and she loves it.It looks realistic and fun to play I even play it good for any age and all animal lovers. :)
B00E8KLWB4|4|Yh right now I am not sure yet but I'll be able to do
B0013FSL3E|2|Love this movie but unfortunately we chose to get a used one and the disc's sound stops throughout the movie.
B00715SUI6|2|I think after seeing all 3 Paranormals this one was a let down... big let down.  What happened?  Who dropped the ball?  I thought the second one was the best and should have stopped while they were ahead.
B008NMT684|5|My two year old grandson and I have a ball playing and putting the puzzles together. He's to the point where he tries to do it faster than me. Great game!
B00E8KLWB4|4|I can play this game for as long as we I have the time and energy to play the game.
B009CPJHY4|5|Loved it!
B0083P1QUM|1|I couldn't even begin to follow this book. I've read all that she has written and I was still lost.
1582701709|2|This book could be somewhat of an inspiration, but most of the concepts within I've already read in the Bible. (Ask, Believe, Receive). It just supplants \\"God\\" with the \\"Universe\\". The book has nothing groundbreaking in it-it's mostly about positive thinking and manifesting things with thought. I'd simply recommend being more positive and expecting good things in life.
B0053VKP8S|5|If you are deciding between the two available on Amazon, just go for this one... it's half -price and it works exactly as expected  good quality too) comes in a very small box, and \\"just works\\".  Enjoy!
B000L212HC|5|Another great movie by Christopher Nolan with several twists. You'll always be looking out for the truth and you'll be forced to think about several theories to what has unfolded. Great cast, great movie.
B007J4T2G8|1|I consider this pure trash!!  The plot is absured, the contents bordered on bneing pronographic, and it was  just awful. I rreally had to struggle to make myself finish the book.
B00005O3VC|5|Classic and funny!  Love it!
B00009TB5G|5|Continuing on from the stunning beauty of the extended version of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a paradigm of Epic Adventure. The same themes abound : love, hate, tolerance (between races), action, sorrow, fear. <br />For those who thought that Jackson could not top the final battle scene, I recommend the extra scenes. They not only add to the scope and danger of hand to hand combat but they also explain how the Orc Army was finally decimated. <br />An absolute must for any fan of Tolkien, SF&F fan, adventure movie or classic literature brought to life.
B00FB13Y74|5|The best game I have played in a while. Very addicting.
B00ECTZKJ6|5|This album is sure to grow on you. Ive been a Korn fan since i was 13. With the return of head, korn went back to their signature sound. Im not a huge fan of electronics. Path of totality was a bit too much for me. There were a few good songs from that album. However, they should have left it as an EP. There electronics all iver this record. Unlike path of totality, they're blended into the music instead of overpowering the bass and guitars. Couple of my favorite tracks are victimized, punishment time, I wasn't born yesterday (bonus track).<br />The dvd is well worth it. It's an hour long documentary. Any true korn fan will buy the deluxe package instead of only watching \\"reconciliation\\" through youtube. The dvd goes into head coming back to the band. Inside the studio with pre-production and actual studio recordings.<br />Great to have head back! They seem so refreshed and awakened! Can't wait to hear what's next!
0141439475|4|I'm not big into sci-fi but this book was better than expected.  I only read it for a class.
B00QU140PE|2|The movie is amazing but the audio keep cutting , I have 150 Mbps Comcast cable and my Samsung 4K TV is connected directly to my router via ethernet cable so no wireless involved , I had wanted UHD movies from amazon before and they play just fine but this one had an Audio problem , I restarted the TV and tried again and it was the same issue .
B0052UZIFA|5|you may be reading this, you may not.  if you are, then know somewhere there's an employee of disneyland that hates his job.
B00F7YHDWC|3|very frustrating game
0316789720|5|These books are great for helping young and old learn to draw.  Fun subjects.  Kept my kids busy for hours learning.
B00FRQ32N4|5|I've been playing this game and I promised myself that I wouldn't spend kindle points but I ended up spending it for a good reason though.
B000001EJ8|4|Vangelis is an inovator in electronic music, maybe best known for his highly rated Chariots Of Fire film soundtrack from 1981.  The timeless Titles is in this collection.   Having said that I really enjoy the collaborations with Jon Anderson of Yes fame.  The best being So Long Ago, So Clear, I Hear You Now and to top them all, I'll Find My way Home.  The remainder I do not listern to as often, overall a good compilation lasting 75 minutes.
0786886811|5|I really love this book, and there is no way that this review can extol all of its virtues! The best thing is how accessible Nigella has made all of these procedures. If I am honest; baking always seemed kind of terrifying to me and seemed like it was the territory of the expert. What this book does is demystify all of that and teaches you, in a very calm and freindly way, how to do it. Before I knew it I was baking home made bread and rolling pastry for pies and tarts. As she says; cakes, cookies, and other desserts are a snap and if you follow these methods, you will never see the need for a boxed mix again!<br />The writing, as ever, is wonderful. The text is warm, freindly, and inviting, and reading the book leaves you completely charmed. Again, her way of cutting through porcess leaves you feeling enthused and confident that you can do it. I have many other baking books (Richard Sax, Dorie Greenspan, Sarah Raven, Delia Smith) and all of them are good, but none come close to this. Those other books usually leave me feeling tense, which of course finds a way to sabatoge your cooking. Nigella leaves you feeling calm and confident, allowing you to have repeated success!<br />The recipes themselves are divine! Nigella has always had a knack with sweets, and this is a showcase for that. However, this book contains many recipes for savory tarts, pies, biscuits, and breads as well.Her flavor and texture profiles are always spot on: The Londin Cheese Cake has a light texture and a not too sweet tang. The Snickerdoodles have the feel of a doughnut, with a warm and spiced flavor. The Essential White Loaf features a chewy crust with a soft, fluffy interior. The Dense Chocolate Loaf Cake reads plain on the page, but is heady with flavor and unbelievably moist! Some other favorites include: Easy Almond Cake, Autumnul Birthday Cake, Banana Bread, Coconut Macaroons,Supper Onion Pie, Blackberry Galette, Chestnut Ice Cream Meringue Cake, Torta alla Gianduia, Brownies, ChocolateCherry Cupcakes, Snow Topped Spice Cake, Christmas Cupcakes, Cranberry Upside-Down Cake, Creme Brulee, Brown Bread, Finnish Rye Bread, Bagels, Flatbreads, Passionfruit Curd, Blackberry Jam, and Chinese Plum Sauce. I know this is a long list; but the book really does help you make a habit out of home baking, and you will find that there are countless reasons in which a home-made something needs to be produced.<br />My one suggestion would be to avoid the American print of this book. Unfortunately, the American publisher did a poor job in translating the recipes into imperial measurements. Go to Amazon UK, order the original UK print, and buy a food scale to help you with the metric measurements. This will actually help you as the metric system is MUCH MORE reliable when baking!<br />In my opinion, this is the best baking book avialable, and I reccomend it highly!
B001NZ3DY6|5|Awesome collection of all of her best hits!
B007ZGO7EM|5|I use this calculator on my kindle fire frequently. It does what it was create  to do and is very convenient. I highly recommend it and would purchase another app from this developer.
B007SYWFRM|5|Lots of fun. My daughter and myself have fun with this game on both of our kindles. Always something new on it.
B00BB3UYS8|5|I so enjoyed the series &#34;The Inner Movement&#34; ! It kept me thinking and engaged through all three books. I don't often reread a story but I will be rereading this one.<br />I found the characters intriguing. They came to life almost effortlessly and I was hooked.<br />The creation of the different portals, out views, and astral communication spoke of the creative abilities that this author posses.<br />Thank you for many hours of reading enjoyment.<br />Marguertie Warriner
B00VFTCGES|1|Terrible!  Huge disappointment.  We should have stopped watching about half way through but kept hoping it would start getting interesting and making some sense--but it did neither.
141970642X|3|I DID NOT GO THROUGH OR READ  IT BUT MY SON DIDN'T ENJOY THE STORY AND SOME OF THE PICTURE ILLUSTRATIONS
B00ISS01RS|5|Love this app. Makes extremely amazing videos. Deserves 10 stars. At Least. I love making movies on this thing. Probably the best video editing app in the entireworld.
B005L38QHA|2|I bought this mouse mainly for the four thumb buttons. I figured it may work for mapping them to WASD for movement. The problem is, you can't map most keys on the mouse to a keystroke, so I actually had to create a macro to do a single key press for each one. It took a while to get it all working just right. I also had trouble with macros working in different games (SWTOR, GW2 beta, and Rift). Finally I gave up, and went with a Logitech G700, which so far, I'm very happy with.<br /><br />This mouse is made to mesh with World of Warcraft, even with the ability to assign key maps to the various buttons from inside the game. While I'm sure it does great at that (I don't play WoW anymore, so no first hand experience), it's just not very good for any other games.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are buying this mouse for World of Warcraft, you'll probably be happy. If you're buying it for other games, look for something else.
B0010YSD7M|5|Great way to tie in the end of season 10. Some little story lines didn't need to be in there, but loved seeing my fav people on screen again. Can't wait for continum.
B002XTBE6K|5|Enjoyed it!
B003M70O5O|5|loved it !
B001BZRUR4|5|Markus Zusak is my new favorite author!  This is the second of his books I've read two of his books and loved them both.  I'll search out all the others I can find and read those too.  He's really talented and has such different plots that are unexpected but really wonderful.
B008AK8FHM|4|Pretty good read.
B004SDEP38|5|I don't know what I would do without this app! It provides everything I need, just as if I was working from my pc. The workbooks are great and I can email the documents to myself. Love it!
B00BIPORC8|5|Every now and then you come across a TV series worth spending some serious time with. You found one with TGW. The writing and acting is nuanced, there is a riveting plot line, and the characters are at least moderately complex. Plus the interplay between Will and Alicia is addictive. My favorite of 2014.
B00J7UL6V6|5|Ever since the Black Keys have begun their musical journey this one is another that will make you so happy with their unique sound, lyrics, and rhythm.
B00FLML7HW|5|Excellents sériés!!!
B00637HXNG|5|Wouldn't play on my Samsung BlueRat (I believe it's a 2550), but I hijacked my kids' PS3 and that worked.  I forgot how many good songs they did.  I played it at a gathering where my brothers (in their mid 40's) were present and they LOVED IT.
B00EIL7E9C|5|Just what I expected. Crazy, but good.
B00004RJ71|5|it is a very good movie, its an attention holder for real!!! you have to get it and watch it!!!!
B00DD77PO6|1|There is nothing to this book.  The illustrations are good but there is no story and no vocabulary.  Don't buy.
B00479SVBU|5|Got 5 and all work fine.
B00MRHANNI|5|liked the immediate download...
B00DJFIMW6|4|The minions are AWESOME the game is almost perfect but.  Mega giant flying seals of the water I dont want to pay $50 for a costume
0783229526|1|I bought this after reading the reviews here. To make a long story short, it's the only DVD I 'm considering throwing on the trash can. I have more than 90, from all genres, and never felt this idiot before. The film is ridiculous, the acting is grotesque, I can't believe it gives pleasure to anyone. It's worst than many summer comedies, because it tries to be &quot;cult&quot;. Everything is so overacted and predictable that I didn't even smile once while watching it. As for the DVD only, it's normal, no valuable extras (if only this was possible with such a movie). The Amazon ranking was one of my guides for movies. After this bad trip I'll consider more before buying.
B009UX2YAC|4|This game is addictive and I love the tour. I love every place they choose to go and love it when it changes location.
B003KRJNBW|2|I love Denzel Washington hands down. If he were not in this film, it would be a piece of garbage. At least for me. You may love it. It was violent without purpose, language, just all over the place. But, that's just me.
B00CO4KGYA|5|I found myself having lost of time with this addictive game. It is challenging but not so much that you want to throw your smartphone.
B00AEBB8BU|5|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1975 and it still holds up by today's standards. Redford and Dunaway have great chemistry. The action is tense and the story keeps you engaged throughout the film. I'm glad I added it to my movie collection.
159562015X|4|This was required reading for my management class at UMASS.  I found this really eye opening and helpful.  Strongly recommended to anyone who wants to know more about the way they work.
B00000K3CR|4|Penny Marshall knows comedy, and this warmly sentimental fantasy proved she could deliver hugely commercial entertainment in a delightful way.  Tom Hanks is absolute perfection as Josh, and each player succeeds brilliantly  at bringing to real, vivid and always amusing life the simple, child-like  story.  Mercedes Ruehl had one of her first big breaks here as the mom.   You will love this movie.
B0087FMUCQ|5|this app works great and very easy to use.
B002VWNID6|5|I wanted this so bad. You have to flip it.over to play second half. Srill a great deal. Also a really great price and fast shipping
B00884GR0W|5|really fun game like mine craft<br />I have played it for hours<br />creating your own world is fun!!!!<br />I love block story alot
6305692572|5|never saw a better movie
B006LSZECO|3|Enjoyed the novel and it's written style of one chapter from the protagonist's perspective, next from the antagonist's... Particularly since which character was hero(ine) and which the villain were not immediately discernible.  However, about half way into the story, the defined roles are shoved into the readers face and for the remainder of the novel, one waits for the villian to get their due.  Unfortunately, the reader never receives the satisfaction of a sense of justice and the novel abruptly ends, good and evil trapped in their respective new, old life/old, new life.<br /><br />Pedestrian summer read one can breeze through, but the opportunity for a climactic ending is lost to a weakness unexpected from the characters and author.  Frankly, never having seen the movie and getting through the story without another reader or film goer spoiling the end for me was favorable.  But with the ending, I was left to wonder why anyone would buy the rights to make it into a movie... It was hard enough to capture the images in text, I can only suspect the movie's best part was in casting a &#34;lesser known&#34; actress in the female lead, opposite Ben Affleck, who may make a better writer, director (producer), than he ever will be as an actor for me.
B00009TB5G|5|Peter Jackson pulled off the impossible -- he translated an over-written yet beloved epic into a riveting trilogy.  And yet even with dividing &quot;LOTR&quot; into three long films, Jackson was forced to make dramatic cuts in the story in order to make it fit.  Fans of the books will love this extended version of the film, as it fleshes out the story.  Extended scenes between the hobbits and the Ents, Faramir and Boromir, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn, and Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor are treats.<br />Did Jackson make some departures from Tolkein's novels?  Sure -- he had to, if for no other reason than Tolkein's dialogue is about as dull as can be imagined.  Still, Jackson has faithfully recreated Middle Earth and its stock of beloved characters.  The ensemble cast throws themselves into the roles with gusto, and the special effects are amazing.  <br />The major surprise in this film is the emergence of Gollum (formerly Smeagol), the tortured Ring Bearer from whom Bilbo stole the Ring in &quot;The Hobbit.&quot;  Using CGI, Jackson uses a boffo performance from Andy Serkis (even though Mr. Serkis is never seen because Jackson superimposed CGI over Serkis' form) to create the most fully realized computer-generated character ever.  <br />The extra DVD discs show that this project was obviously a labor of love for those concerned, and their cinematic accomplishments are even more amazing when you see the process of how the film was made.  These DVD extras are worth it!

B00992CF6W|5|Minecraft is an awesome game. My grandson loves to play this game. Minecraft has a lot of skills. It's fun!
B007IXWKUK|5|Romantic, erotic, sultry. Can be slightly redundant, but well done considering the enormous amount of sex happening. No regrets. If you're looking for that carnal, butterfly, feeling, look no further. I will be buying Fifty Shades Freed.
B003O86FMW|5|The Hunger Games trilogy is an excellent series. Book two Catching Fire is full of suspense and excitement. The ending leaves you anxious for book 3 Mockingjay. Can't wait to read it.
B009FZFONO|5|The Walking Dead is my new favorite.  It wasn't until I purchased Netflix subscription that I even knew about the show, which is odd because I watch a ton of TV.  I started watching S1 Episode 1 and had to turn it off as Rick Grimes was coming out of the hospital in the loading dock area.  Creeped me out!  Glad I gave it another chance....now I understand the &#34;walkers&#34; and enjoy seeing them receive the mandatory &#34;cranial massage&#34; which awaits them.  All caught up on 3 seasons....awaiting the airing of S4 this fall.
B004SEUJK0|5|I love this movie.... Such a classic!!! Rene zellweger is absolutely a riot and Colin Firth makes me want to move to London!
B00AEBB89W|5|I followed this story for years and read both of Graysmith's books.  I still believe he was right on the money.
0440238153|5|The Amber Spyglass is the third book in the His Dark Materials series.  The story continues with finding out what happened to Lyra and how Will plans on saving her.  It also follows the stories of Lord Asriel, Mrs. Coutler, Mary Malone, and many others.  Will and Lyra lean they must travel to the land of the dead and to get there they must give somthing up.  It is very heart breaking, I had a hard time reading this part.  Great action sequence with the war between Lord Asriel and the Authority.  I enjoyed reading about Mary Malone and the Mulefa.  But best of all were Will and Lyra.  I loved their story!  I cried my eyes out when I finished the book.  I felt like there was so much left open at then end of this book.  It made me want more.  Philip Pullman is an amazing writer!    On another note, I know how sensitive some people are on the whole religion topic.  As for me, I am on the same boat with Philip Pullman, which may have caused me to enjoy it even more.  But, if you are not like me, and are very religious and take things way too seriously DO NOT read this series.  There is a good posibilty you will be offended by certain things in this story.
B003V1WXKU|2|Zorba's review &#34;Brilliant but insufferable guy&#34; is spot on so I will strongly second but not repeat the excellent points in that review. I stopped reading this book midway because I don't wish to tarnish the admiration I've always had for Feynman based on his incredible contributions to physics and abilities to teach and clearly explain such complex ideas. The large number of glowing 5-star reviews for this book completely baffles me. The writing is clunky, the funny incidents lack a key ingredient (humor...), and Feynman all too often comes off as a self-aggrandizing jerk, intent on making sure everyone else knows he's the brightest bulb in the room.
B005T87QCI|1|Please do not get this game it is not HD and it is too hard so please don't get this game the reviews may be good but it is not.

B004UB9SKS|3|Dont use it enough to give it a good review, but is good in a pinch.
B00FEHXISA|4|Pretty good! Surprise ending. I still prefer the 1st and 2nd ones to this one, but it was still very good. Robert Downey Jr. is a hilarious & cocky as always :)
B0086700CM|4|So you're this explorer, and you stole some idol that was protected by creepy deamon monkeys. When the game starts, your character is just running out of the temple with po'ed monkeys fast on their heels. The object of the game is to make it as far away from the temple as possible without tripping or falling; collecting coins and temporary perks along the way. These perks can be upgraded in the shop for the coins you collect. There are also a few characters to be unlocked for a pretty price.<br />The visuals are pretty good, and your surroundings are nicely detailed. The only problem I have with it is the sensetivity. It lags a lot, and doesn't respond, so I end up not getting as high a score as I normally could. I'm not sure if it's my device, but if it isn't, I hope it gets fixed soon.
0061367036|4|My daughter is an avid SuperNatural fan, this was a stocking stuffer for her - she loved it!  She feels it is very informative and is jam-packed with detailed information on demons, spirits, etc.   She would recommend this book for any true SuperNatural fan.

I just don't understand why people think he is somehow \\"different\\" from the rest...<br /><br />from wiki:<br /><br />\\"Obama's current economic advisors are Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago and Jeffrey Liebman of Harvard University.[1]<br /><br />Obama wrote: \\"we should be asking ourselves what mix of policies will lead to a dynamic free market and widespread economic security, entrepreneurial innovation and upward mobility [...] we should be guided by what works.\\"[2] Speaking before the National Press Club in April 2005, he defended the New Deal social welfare policies of Franklin D.

B008K8VDPU|5|Lo ve it !!
B00AN0KBJC|5|I don't know why but this series has me completely captivated in spite of the violence and how women are treated, although it is true to the times.  The characters are so compelling and the story stays true to itself, never compromising just because you love a character does mean he/she is going to live very long.  My favorite is Bran.  I love the mysticism included in this series.
B00F87ZUYG|5|Excellent mid-season, dramatic turn. Didn't think they had anywhere to go with story but I was wrong.  Good acting continues.
B000EYK4GW|5|This is such an incredibly adorable Disney classic.<br /><br />Ho very happy to have found it.<br /><br />What a perfect purchase!  THANK YOU!
1476770387|5|Great book. without going into great detail, it puts together the writing styles that King has employed in several of his other books, with great success.
B0034DGPEU|5|This historical drama deftly pulls the reader in from the first page and catapults her through countless emotional up and downs. Count on a few too-late nights unable to put the book down!
1582701709|4|Good product
B00F8GYC1Y|2|Downloaded the game today. Great game and graphics,  but after playing a level or two,  the game slows down, freezes quite often, and there are flashes randomly all over the screen where you can see the pixels. I gave up trying to play it. Maybe it is just a problem on the Kindle Fire? Not impressed.
B0015442YU|5|Great Movie! Please watch the trilogy. Anthony Hopkins performance is terrific. I would recommend this movie to all that love suspense!
0307010856|5|I have given this book to several children.  It is always a hit with them and with the parents as well.  Terrific humor for children.
B005NACYQU|4|I love Gaimans idea about the gods and the supernatural beings as anthropomorf personifications of human beliefs, that aquire an independent existence after they have been brought into this world, simply by an honest act of believing. And how that can actually suck pretty bad, when a god is forced to exist in a world where noone believes in him.<br />The protagonist Shadow does not know these things, as he starts his travels with the gods. He meets a trickster, a seasoned con, a homicidal maniac, and some rather strange characters living lives on the fringes of society, seemingly barely scraping by.<br />All becomes clear, eventually. If ever this book gets filmed, I hope Anthony Hopkins is still around, because he would look a lot more at home in Neil Gaimans version of Odin the Allfather, than he did in the Marvel movies about Thor, the god of thunder.<br />It`s the first novel by Neil Gaiman that i ever read, and i cannot believe it took me that long.
B0066WJLU6|4|Very nice .... The flash light is very bright and makes it easy to see in the dark... I recommend it
B007STBUIW|4|Absolutely one of the very best in shark drama, pure classic, audiences will love and also remember this one for a very long time to come, depite it's compititions.
B00JVZ0DQG|3|When I log on to the game it says &amp;#34; There has been a problem with the amazon app store  please try again later&amp;#34; I love this game but I've tried everything PLEASE HELP I want to play this game so much.
B001EIK7IC|5|Must have for enjoyment of smooth velvet jazz male voice.
B007J4T2G8|5|What an excellent read, utterly captivating throughout. I will undoubtedly be reading the sequels. Disappointing it had to end so abruptly.
B009M2T7K6|5|excelente
B000000H3W|5|great album
B00001X590|4|Joe Cocker and a stellar case of rock's Who's Who from the late `60s overcame a bit of turbulence in the studio to create one of the defining works of that time, a great introduction to Mr. Cocker, and a great reminder of just how much talent and musicianship existed then.<br /><br />Listening to these songs now, it's interesting to hear Jimmy Page underplaying his parts and to hear how Albert Lee was already the consummate guitar session man. Of course, this album is all about vocals, and Mr. Cocker let the world know he was ready to be reckoned with on this debut. The fine backup singers really help frame his sometimes out-of-bounds singing, but this set still swings and sound remarkably fresh considering it is 40-plus years old now.<br /><br />The sound is a bit cleaner on this remaster, and the bonus tracks, while worth a listen, neither add to or detract from the recording's status.
0060873027|1|Until now, I thought that the worst Michael Crichton book was TIMELINE, or maybe the one about the half-chimpanzee human child.  Both were stinkers, but MICRO is a new low.  And to make matters worst, it apparently will have a sequel. \\"Don't Forget Michael Crichton,\\" indeed. MICRO is your evidence that the family and Preston have. Save your money.
B00DRPVE3M|1|Can't be used offline.
B00002MZ2C|5|Wow.  Now there is a powerful album.  Rage Against the Machine knows exactly what the problem with US government is, so they use their awesome musical talent to protest against it.  With Tom Morello and YTimK using  their guitars to make sound effects seeming impossible without DJ  equiptment, they make very powerful and hard-rocking songs to get their  message across.  Though it differs from earlier styles of music, this album  creates new ideas for music, and for fighting against the power.  This  album is a must-have for any Rage fan.
1400063515|5|I really enjoyed this book. The author managed to hold my attention and even if the book's main points are quickly postulated I think that the abundant anecdotes help to really grasp the main message. So read it and learn from it.    Apart from that it is really funny to see how the author falls in some traps himself (which he admits, but some  have found their way into the book). So I would like to start a little game and collect these \\"faultlines\\". My first throw: In one chapter NNT is approached by an Italian scholar who is convinced that Taleb has grown into an sceptical empiricist because he hails form the Levantine, which is supposed to be the ideal breeding ground for Talebs intellectual developement. NNT  reports that he nearly fell for it but then begged to differ: Nationalities are no good to generally predict personal pecularities. But the funny thing: He keeps on bashing the French people in the book (at least a dozen times) and contradicts the aforesaid but also confirms how easily one can fall into hardwired traps.
B002WY65UQ|4|Pretty good as a \\"brought up to date\\" version of the old St. Trinian's stories.  Certainly worth watching even without  the original Alistair Simm and George Cole characters, RIP.
B00DJFIMW6|5|this game is addictive, i play for hours.good way to pass time whem riding in car on trips and waiting rooms
B00JB3MVCW|2|This movie is far from the truth in the Bible
B0054JZC6E|3|what can I say, it is free, and seems to be huge on content, and all the creativity that has been put in in trying generate money for himself is commendable
B004I4H8QS|5|Excellent CD!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Absolutely engrossing series that you won't be able to stop watching and will long for the next session!  Acting and storyline are top notch!
B002VPE1WK|5|Everyone is trying to take my bag from me. It's construction is well done and I have found it to be very convenient in taking all my equipment around comfortably.
B007SGLZP8|5|John Grisham is becoming one of my favorite authors.  This book was so involved that I couldn't predict how it was going to end.  That is a great thing.  Usually I can figure out who is working with who or where things are going but he did such a good job that I was guessing the whole time.
B008XG1X18|5|Fabulous ideas and wonderful people who are constantly sharing their creativity. I spend lots of time everyday just browsing and smiling.
B00E1LTEG0|5|Fantastic
B003SI605K|5|I recommend this movie to be watched by mothers and daughters, girl friends and even couples. Won't give away the story but I will say that this is a must see. The movie is from a woman's perspective. The acting is great and the story is too. The characters although played mainly by Asian actors, have no ethnicity. You will find yourself relating to at least one if not a combination of the characters. It is not a man-bashing movie by any means. It is more about the human heart, relationships and knowing yourself. By the end of the movie you will find yourself examining where you are and where you want to be. Oh, and don't forget your box of tissues. You will find yourself laughing and crying all at once. Please watch it with no interruptions.
B004A8ZWVK|5|Like the book I read last summer which I couldn't put down, couldn't stop watching this. Hard-hitting dramedy comes wrapped in a dust cloth -- doesn't cover up the message but it doesn't sting as much when you're slapped with it.
0671656244|5|Forget GAME OF THRONES, this is George RR Martin's masterpiece.  I buy extra copies to give away.  A hard look at the future of ecological engineering and the future of mankind among the stars.  Haviland Tuf is a thinking man's hero.
0451419243|5|Love this series. I can't wait to finish the next book
B00CSR2J9I|5|My grandson got me to play and I love it. I can hardly put it down. I want to see if I can get ahead of him. Hehe

B00ADS98FC|5|If you like pop music, cheesy teen romance, and want to escape and just enjoy a couple hours off, this is the right movie for you
B0029LCJJS|4|I loved it.  I like historical novels best, and this is one come to life.  All the pageantry and costuming and beautiful scenery all put together with lots of drama and sex.  And it's mostly all true!  What's not to like?
630529142X|4|Adam Sandler is an amazing actor who can convey many comical individuals. This movie is very hilarious but for a mature audience of course. There are certain portions in this film that are absolutely unimaginable, but they are funny. The farmer is the most hilarious character other than Adam Sandler's character.
B000002BYD|5|Since releasing their self-titled album, which I think is their best album since \\"Ten\\", <br />I decided to go back into the Pearl Jam catalogue and check out their other stuff. \\"Yield\\" is a promising album, despite the drummer is Jack Irons (who's good but not as good as Matt Cameron), and it starts off promisingly. For some reason the last few songs just didn't me as hard as the first ones did. \\"Wishlist\\" & \\"Pilate\\" are two PJ classics and Eddie's lyrics are top notch (although there are some lyrics here by Jeff Ament & Stone Gossard as well). I do like this album enough to buy, but check out the new album, Ten, Vs., or Vitalogy first. Here are the tracks: <br /> <br />1. Brain of J-5/5-This song is really catchy and good. It's simalar to the song \\"Life Wasted\\" off their new album, but it's good album opener. <br />2. Faithfull-5/5-This song is catchy as well and has some interesting lyrics. <br />3. No Way-5/5-This song has some great lyrics; The lyrics are better than the song itself and the best part of the song is the chorus. <br />4. Given to Fly-5/5-I love the lyrics to this song, but this is a great song period. <br />5. Wishlist-5/5-This is one of my favorite Pearl Jam songs, it's so cool and Eddie sings it perfectly. <br />6. Pilate-5/5-This is another one of my favorite PJ songs. The song was written by Jeff Ament and is such a simple song but it's really good. \\"Like Pilate, I have a dog.\\" <br />7. Do the Evolution-3/5-I know that this is one of their hit songs, but I really don't like this song that much...It's kind of annoying. <br />8. *-5/5-A kind of semi-drum solo weird thing done by then-drummer Jack Irons. It's pretty cool, although it's just a filler. <br />9. MFC-4/5-This song is really short and not that great. <br />10. Low Light-3/5-This song's like the last two, it's just OK. Nothing really stands out about it. <br />11. In Hiding-5/5-This songs a lot better than the last few songs, but it's still not a PJ masterpiece. <br />12. Push Me, PullMe-2/5-This song totally sucks. It's not even a song, it's Eddie talking with a bad musical background. <br />13. All Those Yesterdays-4/5-This song has to grow on you. It's start off bad and gets better as it progresses. There's an instrumental hidden track directly following this song, which is quite good though. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+ <br />
B00785P2QC|4|I like it. :/ lalslalslalaka. its a fun game it has its moments when its gard to. complete. a task but I get through it most of the time.
B006LXQID8|5|This movie is just adorable and teaches you life is too short to be fixing everyone's life! It's also very funny and has some adult parts in it, so be aware if you're showing children!
0156027321|5|I don't know what moral words I can use to describe this book, let alone to get the point across that it is a priceless work of literary art.  But, that's not going to stop me from trying:<br /><br />I knew the main idea of Life of Pi before I actually read it, I think most people did.  It is a book about a teenage Indian boy who is shipwrecked and stuck on a lifeboat with a male Bengal tiger.  Normally, that would be enough for me to at to a to-read list of some sort.  But, I never did.  Until I saw the trailer for the movie, with it's amazing visuals.  Any book that could inspire such artistry must be worth reading.  I was right!  The book isn't just about Pi's ordeal with tiger, whose name is Richard Parker, it is indeed about his life.  Which I greatly enjoyed reading about.  The whole 356 pages could just have been about Pi's life, minus the bit about being stuck out at sea with a tiger, and I would have loved it just as much.  He lived a very interesting life.  He lived at zoo and therefore had a vast knowledge of animals.  As someone who loves animals, that was a plus.  I also greatly admired his character and personality.  Though, I have to admire Richard Parker too.<br /><br />All in all Life of Pi is a book I found very profound to read.
B0000046ZJ|5|Stan Getz in person was quite unpleasant apparently. Quite in contrast to his wonderful Tenor Sax playing. Here he supported by the Oscar Peterson Trio in a session recorded in October 1957.<br /><br />The most noticeable thing about this session is that there is no drummer, although sometimes you'd swear there was as it swings hard! The trio is Ray Brown - Bass, Herb Ellis - Guitar, and Oscar Peterson - Piano. The first track \\"I want to be happy\\" absolutely motors along with Getz playing a typically lyrical inventive solo followed by a blistering reply from Peterson.<br /><br />The other oddity is the last track \\"Blues for herky\\", a straight blues started by Peterson with a downhome Jimmy Yancy boogie-woogie left-hand. A boogie-woogie feel is maintained throughout the whole track and finishes the album off perfectly leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />If the rest of the album isn't quite as interesting as those two tracks theres plenty of other classy tracks that you may well prefer. Well worth getting.
B00BATKZG4|5|Cameron did a phenomenal job teaching and educating us on the in and outs of our body.  Made me feel sorry for mine & promise to it that I will definitely do better.  This book is a MUST read!!!!!!!!  I'm hoping Cameron comes out with a recipe book, because the recipes she mentioned in this book sound DELISH!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5|Loved loved loved this trilogy
B00003CXDD|3|This is a classic fantasy film.  I bought it to enjoy with my daughters as I enjoyed it as a youngster.
B003XF1XOQ|1|This book is terrible with the blood and sacrificing the children
0345544927|3|I have been a Jodi Picoult fan for ages, but somehow this book left me cold.  Picoult writes with her usual skill to draw the reader into the heart and mind of her characters; to evoke empathy for them.  And it's not that there aren't enough clues so that the ending is totally out of the blue.  But it is an encouragement to people to dabble in spiritualism which is enough of a fad right now to make me uncomfortable.  Sorry, Jodi, because I've loved most of your earlier work.
0792164903|5|One of my favorite movies. The costume designer out did themselves in this movie. Wonderful mastery of the story of sleepy hallow.
B008Y7G1BI|5|Nice it is. Screenplay is at its best.  Love the way the perception was captured. A good movie indeed. Good
B009C7ZQM4|3|For free it's not bad, fairly quick and gets the basic tasks done. It is an easy uninstall in the event you don't like it.
B00005YUNY|5|Yes with an Orchestra?? Of course.... If you are a Yes fan, this has been a long time coming. The mix (I prefer the DTS, has the best bass range) is wonderful and the animation is a nice addition with the ability to turn it off if you like. The playing is superb (yes, I know its not Bruford, but let's face it , he was only there for a few albums compared to White who went through a lot more with the band) and the absence of Wakeman is noticeable, but the keyboard player plus the orchestra really makes up for this. For the purist this may not do, but for a real prog/Yes fan, it sounds wonderful. Anderson and Howe are totally up to the task (Jon sounds incredible although he is a little flaky on the song intros)The funniest thing is Squires Spandex pants (he still thinks he's 18.)<br />Track selection is marvelous (Even a 'Ritual' performance Mmmmm.)New and old combine nicely here and we get the classics (as always) including 'Long Distance Runaround' and 'And You and I'
0440219078|4|Our world today is totally different than Jonas's world. I liked that noone in his world had bad memories about the past to deal with. Only the Giver and Jonas the Receiver of memories received the memories of pain and color.  I also likedthat everyone over 12 had a job in the community. Those are some of the many reasons I liked this book.
B00I8H6X58|5|This is such a great story that is finally getting to the masses.  The cast did a phenomenal job.  I was amazed at the courage and the will to just live.
B007V5CF5K|5|Excellent!! Finished it in 36 hours. Of course I had to work on only 5 hours of sleep and sneak off at work to play but that is how awesome this game is. I just bought the second one. Gotta go!! It's calling me.
B000003TA4|1|Then I grew up and realized that I don't have to buy music just because MTV or Rolling Stone says it's good. Nirvana sucked and had limited, if any, musical talent. The only member who had any talent was Dave Grohl. This album was totally cut and pasted in the studio to be mass marketed and it shows. Cobain couldn't play the guitar, couldn't sing, and his lyrics were nonsensical whining. Do your ears and your mind a favor and pick up some rock music played by actual musicians.
B0083P1QUM|3|this book was mediocre compared to others.  slow moving at times.  enjoyable but not at the usual high level of storytelling.
B000FVE3A2|5|Watch as advertised,  nice look,  as close to a Rolex as you can get for only $105 delivered vs over $10k. Showed my boss who has a Rolex and he said its the closest to a Rolex that he has seen.<br />Very comfortable to wear,  great compliments.
B005ARYEPK|5|Movie came in great condition for a great price. Fun movie for everything one to watch and enjoy in many families.

B00R2LZ41K|5|Tolkein would have been proud... Jackson did a great job in keeping with the final outcome according to the book. Interesting how he wove in new characters and still kept the story moving. Nice lead in to &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; at the end.

B007XKEY6Q|5|i am really getting a kick out of draw something, some times i wonder how in the world i am going to draw what they give me to pick from but coming up with the how to's makes  my brain work and thats a really good thing.  this is fun and my friends i play with enjoy it alot.
B006885EFE|5|Fantastic!  This mini-series gives viewers an amazing perspective of what these brave men went through during WWII.  It gives an inside view of the life of airborne infantry soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division during some of the most important battles of the war as well as the more mundane aspects of military life.  I thoroughly appreciated the interviews of the real men who gave everything to fight for our country.<br /><br />The series goes from the staging of the invasion of Normandy to the actual airborne operations during D-Day itself and follows Easy company throughout the European theatre of operation.  The fight from France to Belgium and Holland and onwards to Germany.<br /><br />You will laugh, be angry and maybe cry a little at some of the situations.  You will also experience the leadership and caring of a certain man who's dedication to his men was unwavering. This was the one aspect that I really admired. These men came from all walks of life and from all over the country whose shared experiences created human bonds that are almost impossible to find in this life.  I am thankful and grateful that our country had men such as these.  These men make me proud to be American.<br /><br />Not suitable for younger viewers because it is graphic.<br /><br />The only disappointing thing was, like all good things, that it had to end.  Hats off to the production crew.
B006LRUVUA|5|supeb.....
B0089LOG02|4|This is a lovely and moving novel that was a favorite with my book group. And while this plot is fiction, it is based on a true period in America's history and a real organization- The Children's Aid Society. For those interested in learning more about orphan trains, there is a book by Stephen O'Connor entitled Orphan Trains: The Story of Charles Loring Brace and the Children He Saved and Failed published by Houghton Mifflin.
B000BMSTMS|5|Amazing
0440180295|5|Put simply, the best book I have ever read.  I love war books, and this one is certainly not one of your average war books.  It's different.  Read it.
B00BLCHZC2|5|A little gruesome and violent.  But I'm sure it's accurate to the times. Cant wait to see the next season.
B002NVTSGQ|1|Too &#34;modern&#34; to be entertaining.
0316055433|1|This story started out with a lot of potential and I read about 400 pages hoping it would improve. It didn't. so I skipped to the ending which was totally incomprehensible. One of the worst books ever, don't waste your time!
B0046B8GEQ|5|Fantastic Movie.  Have watched it several times.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|One of the best shows I have ever watched, well written very entertaining.  I have watched this 3 times, can't get enough.
B00IX035QA|3|I can hardly object all positive reviews that hail the quality of writing, scripting and gameplay as an overall experience. However, one should be aware this is far from a complete story and it comes to an abrupt ending. This way of promoting into the second part is disappointing and leaves bitter taste of the otherwise engaging story.
B005LCYR7Y|5|A great read from start to finish.<br />Very compelling - I couldn't put it down.  I liked the way he entwined all outcomes of the intricacies of time travel.
B00BEZTMWW|5|I've been a fan of Middle Earth for several years now and have looked forward to the release of all of the movies. At first I was disappointed when I learned the Hobbit was to be turned into three movies but now I'm excited and pleased by the prospect of three movies. For one thing it will give three more opportunities to visit the movie version of Middle Earth.<br /><br />This particular set of discs has something for everybody; the 3D version is effective and I found myself dodging a burning pinecone as it flew at my head. The Blu-Ray 2D version and the DVD also have excellent audio and video and are each enjoyable in their own way.<br /><br />One feature that I particularly enjoyed was the Special Features disc; it is filled with fascinating shots of New Zealand and, most importantly for me, the progressive story of the making of the movie told in 10 production videos hosted by Peter Jackson. The videos carry the process of producing the movie from the pre-production phase, through the production and post-production phases to the world premier in New Zealand. If you've ever wondered what all of those people with strange titles do then you have a chance to not only see what they do but to meet some of them as well. I was filled with a new respect for the incredible effort required to produce a movie like the Hobbit and get it to the screen!<br /><br />It was fun and very entertaining to watch and I recommend it along with the movie itself. I look forward even more to movies two and three!<br /><br />This one is a keeper and will stand up to repeated viewings; I recommend it for the entire family.
B00HDMMISA|3|A good summer read but rather predictable.
B00DRPVE3M|4|It's a true fun game! The only thing I don't like is when players take forever and time out, it annoying but still a fun game!
B0064MPXFA|5|So glad I can catch up on series I missed when I was working. I absolutely love this series and it's so great being able to watch it when I want. The acting is superb and the story lines interesting and provides a glimpse into the often not so nice reality of the law/political life. A+ for sure
B00821OX98|4|Falling Skies may not be award-worthy, but it's entertaining and suspenseful.  Also, it's a show I can watch with my 9 year old son without him being too frightened and without my husband and me being too bored.
B0025KW29U|5|It's awesome. Don't even think about it- just buy it already!
B004V6X902|3|it was okay. very inappropriate. i'm a huge fan of jim carrey and ewan mcgregor, they were very funny but again inappropiate.
B00992CF6W|4|This app was really surprising when I got it mojang did a great job except for some tiny little things.<br />1 Redstone has no use  at all it just there<br /><br />2 there is no running / sprinting feature<br /><br />3it's not.as big as the pc version needs some.updates<br /> 4 there is no skins or a.good mp feature<br /><br />All together this is a great app aside from those bugs I give it four stars don't get me wrong I love minecraft I just prefer pc more than this
B006PTZNSY|4|I had no expectations when I ordered this cd. Starships was the only song my the artist I had heard. For the most part I enjoy the cd, but only the second half. (Songs 10-18) The rest of the cd is a little too off the wall for my tastes, but all in all a good buy.
B004J4WKUQ|5|Really good book. Great protagonist. Very likable characters. It's a story that mixes minecraft with d&d and makes it work. And it has a happy ending!
B009C7JS14|4|The only thing that i would add to this is the ability to have a radar, otherwise it gives me all the info i need when leaving the house.  If there ever is a radar, then i will give 5 stars
B001DUKHXQ|3|Love the vinyl and the album itself, but dislike the packaging. Doesn't store well.
B00EKXDVOK|5|Always 5 Stars for the Living Legend of our time. No one even comes close.
B002ZTIIXK|5|A great 2 c d set. Enjoying new and old songs by k d lang.
B008ZVNC2O|2|Terrible song choices. The voice is still there, with some key changes perhaps, but the album lacks deep soul. This is only a thin varnish of what we remember in Mick's heart.
B0098VYCCE|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm not a big fan of Kirsten Stewart's very stiff acting, but it looks like this really was a great role for her. (Very little speaking on her part!) Anyhow, two thumbs up!
B00BJ9VBLI|5|haven't gotten very far, but sure is a nice game and I am enjoying it.  Good graphics, plays fast.  Colorful.
B001AGXEAG|4|I enjoyed this movie when I was little and I was sure that my 11 year old would too. She likes it a lot. There are a couple of \\"insinuate\\" scenes where Beetlejuice creates an exotic club for himself (I completely forgot about) but overall it's a good movie with GREAT music/dance scenes
B009FZHYKU|5|So far so good.  Nice pick-up from season two.  I'm really starting to get engaged with the main characters.  Even though a couple got unexpected chomped on and two new members were added, it was a good shake-up.  Not yet sure how I feel about the separate storyline with the two females connecting with Meryl and the community of survivors, although nice to see mad man Meryl back.  It is an interesting take though; we'll have to see how it progresses.  Looking forward to seeing more of the chick with the sword in action.
B000021Y77|2|I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted  watching this style of German movie making.   The use of cartoons takes much away from the story. I don't think I have patience to watch it again  so I will probably trash it.
B0050DIWFC|4|Good start, plot, and excellent ending..just a little dragged out at some points..overall it is a thought provoking, entertaining, well written book.
B0009VRHLK|3|It has taken me eight years to be able to even begin to embrace this film. I've disliked this film immensely for the past several years, and when I re-watched it recently to be able to properly write this review, I dragged my feet on the ground until I wore a hole in my shoe. My sister warned me it was awful, but I didn't heed her warning. The first time I ever saw it was when it came out on DVD. It was unavailable at most video stores, and the ones that did carry it tended to always have their copies rented out, and most other stores just stuck it in the ADULT section. Being underage, that would've made renting it out from those stores impossible, so I ended up just buying the DVD from a local Borders. I was about sixteen years old at the time, but luckily I knew the clerk who sold it to me. He was (and still very much is) a queer like me who knew I was always on the prowl for challenging films with intense subject matter. I also knew that he hated this film but really was eager to know what I thought about it. I had seen Buffalo '66 prior to this and loved it, and I was already familiar with Vincent Gallo as an actor with films like The Funeral and Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby. When I sat down and watched The Brown Bunny, I was completely put off by Gallo apparently just like most moviegoers who saw the picture tended to be. The Brown Bunny is an infuriating experience, full of awkward scenarios of uncomfortable and, frankly, inhuman behavior that resembles the worst and the most banal aspects of everyday reality. I remember telling my Borders friend exactly those words. Oh boy did I hate this film. Sitting through it was so difficult for me, in fact, that I ended up injuring my right shoulder due to how much I was cringing and squirming throughout. I had to remove all of my clothing because the picture was making me feel like I was about to have an anxiety attack. If there is one thing that I can safely say about The Brown Bunny, it's among one of the most difficult films to actively sit through. If you're going into it thinking it'll JUST be a meditative, hypnotic experience that puts a microscope above everyday human behavior, prepare to be greatly disappointed. This film is deliberately pessimistic, angry, creepy, and emotionally and staggeringly hateful. Just about the only kind words to say about it is that its more light-hearted and more entertaining than Gus Van Sant's Gerry. This was my reaction the first time I viewed The Brown Bunny.<br /><br />Since 2005, when I first viewed The Brown Bunny, I have watched the picture six times. That's five more times than I've seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. To put that into a more honest perspective, I've seen Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey roughly around twelve or thirteen times, all of these viewing in the span of a good two years when I was utterly obsessed with the movie. I've watched the William Hurt film The King about eighteen times total. I've attempted to watch Gosford Park about ten different times. I still haven't finished it. The point is, I love to re-watch strange art films that are difficult to swallow. The stranger the better. I can hardly wait to re-watch Wendy and Lucy, which to me is a similarly troubling film that I reacted very similarly to as I did The Brown Bunny. The Brown Bunny is one film that I have a difficult time re-watching. I've only ever watched it by myself, which is honestly probably the best way to watch it I feel. Every time I've watched it, it puts me through the emotional ringer. There's nothing that makes me more uncomfortable than emotional dysfunction, I've come to realize upon my latest re-watch. The Brown Bunny is not only a film about that, but it also explores it in what could be the most horrific way to explore material like this. Each time I've viewed this film, I've appreciated it slightly more and more. The first time I viewed this film, obviously as you can tell from above, I hated every aspect of it. Couldn't even begin to appreciate any element or scene of it. To me, it was just one big embarrassment. I refuse to call the picture a vanity project. A vanity project implies that the end result holds some sort of beauty, whether subjective or objective, and I don't even think defenders of this film can say that the subject matter or the imagery of this film isn't ugly. It's beautifully shot, sure, and it's beautifully presented, but do the ideas hold any kind of beauty to them? I don't know, I guess it depends on the person. The second time I watched it, I found the finale of the picture itself to be rewarding, but the fact that it takes place at the end of such an agonizing and humiliating experience of a film somehow made it feel futile to even begin to try and embrace. The third time I watched it, I was struck a lot more by the weight of the circumstances of the main character, Bud, who spends the whole movie driving his truck, occasionally stopping to re-visit and speak to acquaintances, drive his motorcycle, and have bizarre and cruel interactions with random females, before ultimately confronting an old girlfriend of his played by Chlöe Sevigny.<br /><br />The forth and fifth time, I found myself enjoying more and more of the hypnotic imagery. The sixth time, I found the combination of long, meditative shots and intense emotional quality to be more interesting, but couldn't get past the dry atmosphere. The seventh time I watched it, I began to understand its darker elements a lot more, but was still put off by the sheer anger of the presentation. Now I've seen it again, back in late July of 2013. I am now starting to truly realize why I have such a difficult time with the picture, and why it is such a brilliant work of art. Make no mistake, the experience of The Brown Bunny is one that gets me shaking with fear, but now I can properly put into words what specifically makes it so off-putting and ugly. Vincent Gallo very much bared his heart and soul into this picture, and the reason why I initially rejected it is because I, along with many other men out there, have a deep personal fear of showing emotion and showing any sort of fragility. This is a film that explores the inherent weakness in men in the most personal way possible. It is a film that explores why masculinity will truly be the death of us all. I am ashamed to really say this, but as of writing this I am in my mid-twenties and I still sometimes feel like I've never grown up and am afraid that I never will. What does it mean to grow up? Who we have in this film is Bud, and I think the film makes it fairly obvious that he has not grown up nor does he have the mind of a typical adult. I think his behavior in this film is mostly childish, and he still very much shows a genuine fear of women through all the weird and disturbing behavior he exhibits throughout the story. He loved his ex-girlfriend Daisy (Chlöe Sevigny) so much because she represented someone who could actually take care of him and raise him like some kind of child still. He could act and behave like an adult, and even be in love with her and find her attractive and would even be willing to engage in sexual intercourse, but when it came to having a healthy relationship with no strings attached and no complications, he was a genuine failure. That's what makes the finale so heart pounding to me. He is completely lost and aimless in this world without another woman to take care of him. He is, I'm afraid, representative of many of the men out there. Many men haven't truly grown up and feel the need to have a woman in their life because they feel that's the only way that they can have any sort of guidance. Unfortunately, in the case of Bud, Daisy was a drug addict and was extremely self-destructive, and that's why this film is so troubling. We're watching a despicable man pursue an interaction with a woman who we all know is not healthy for him, and his understated obsession with her is what makes this filmso deeply disturbing and difficult to sit through for me. I can think of hundreds of films that are all about the loneliness of the road and how much of a lie the American dream is, but I cannot think of as many films that are so damn bitter about it as this one is. If it were starring a woman and directed by a woman, critics and audiences would embrace it and celebrate it because that's what they expect. Here, the only thing that gets exploited in The Brown Bunny is Vincent Gallo himself. Even in the infamous hardcore blowjob scene, it is Sevigny who is very much in power and in control. Gallo spends the entire film laying bare everything that is physically wrong with himself. His large chin, his lanky frame, his high-pitched voice, his birdlike scowl, all are on display for about 75% of the film's runtime, and in the end he ultimately is exploring the idea of how it is the weakness of men and their libidos and their constant desire to adhere to tradition and dignity that has destroyed America the most. He presents this idea in the most non-elegant way possible. He paints a portrait of a man who cannot accept death or the idea of someone dying, and it is that kind of inability to move on that leads to the destruction of the human soul and the degradation of the human body.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Bud is a scumbag. The women he picks up throughout the film all look and appear angelic. I'll give you one example of how painful this film is. The first girl, a teenager, has a striking resemblance to many girls that I know and grew up with. She has simplistic facial features. She is one of the most realistic looking girls I've seen in film. Her facial features have an unusual kind of beauty to them. Bud, with his creepy facial features, gets her to fall in love with him by showing a vulnerable, scared side of himself. He plays a different character, essentially. Then he ditches her at her home after he convinces her to quit her job and run inside to get clothes for the road. The scene is one of the scariest scenes in the film, for you almost fear that she'll run out of her home and see Bud drive away. The look on her face, in your mind, will be a look of tragic disappointment and shame. Luckily, she doesn't come running out, however, her face continues to haunt you for you just know that she'll look upset and sad, and seeing such a cute face with such crushed disappointment is an uncomfortable and utterly maddening feeling. You start to wish she had so that you could at least have a look of disappointment that doesn't match the horror you picture in your mind. It's almost as if the sadness of the scene itself could never match the tragedy your mind conjures up. That is, I feel, where the true horror of the film lies. It's the Taxi Driver syndrome. The feeling of wishing to see graphic images so that you can take your mind off of the image in your head of a character you care about crying and having an emotional breakdown. As powerful as this film is, The Brown Bunny will always be an uncomfortable, awkward, and creepy experience and always will be. The Brown Bunny is basically the Merchant-Ivory version of The Passion of the Christ. Both could be viewed by some as pornographic pictures that exploit the men rather than the woman. The only difference is that The Passion is slightly more S&M-themed.
0670034711|5|This book was purchased as a gift for my daughter, a college student about to become a college professor in literature.  She said she considers it one of her 5 best books ever (and she reads constantly!)  Now she will pass it to her mother and friends... and demand it be returned!  Exellent, she says.

B006MW3UZW|5|Funny, engaging, romantic. It has become our favorite show to watch! So glad it's available on prime!  We love it.
B00368PSN2|5|I was expecting a weak and/or cheesy movie when I rented this but I am a nerd at heart and the whole sci-fi in viking times sounded awesome.<br /><br />I was wrong, not only was this movie great, but the production value, story, sound and picture quality was incredible. After watching this movie I immediately ordered it from Amazon to add to my blu-ray collection.<br /><br />If the synopsis of this film sounds even remotely interesting to you, get it. You won't be disappointed.
B00GY0HJ4K|1|Initially, I loved the look of this game and how it played.  However, not far into the game, it quickly became apparent that the levels are designed for you to fail so that you are forced to spend more money on lives or additional turns.  No thanks.
B000JMKTLO|5|Such an in-depth book with a very interesting story line. Very had to put down once you're in to it.
B000001GBJ|5|I love this music. I had never heard of this duo before, but was I ever impressed!  I love the cross between Irish/Celtic music and Norwegian music.  The instrumentals are incredible.  This was quick to become my  favorite cd. I just bought the other two!  Very soothing to the soul. Rolf  Lovland is an exceptional artist with a truly remarkable gift. Great duo  with Fionuala!  She's awesome!  Together they share their incredible gifts  of music with the rest of the world.
1484707230|5|Great for my 11 year-old son.  He loved this series!
B003DNN0L2|5|This is a well written and great movie. Family comedy that everyone would enjoy. the director has also directed moonrise kingdom which is also another great family movie.
B00ILHW6AG|2|Just not very good. The last 25 percent was ok, but otherwise I wasn't very interested in what was going on.
B0074JODP8|5|I just watched my 2nd show with Joe Bonamassa on KQED, and have totally fallen in love with his music.  I did purchase at the $125.00 level, so I could get all the music from that night of \\"Live at The Royal Albert Hall!\\"  I have been to the RAH in London on 3 different ocassions to see my favorite band, The Moody Blues, so the RAH has very good memories for me.  I've also been very busy on amazon.com buying more of his music.  I also purchased a ticket for his show in Fresno, CA, that is coming up on 19 Apr 2012, and can't wait to see him live.  I had never heard of this guy, but when he invited Eric Clapton to come out and play a song with him, I would have to say that Joe Bonamassa \\"Has Arrived.\\"  He is fantistic and awesome, and very methodical at times, which puts him in his own style of music.  Thank God for KQED introducing this young man to us, as he is definitly has come into his own!!!  Like Stevie Ray Vaughn says, \\"If the house is rockin', come on in.\\"<br /><br />Peace Out ~ BluesSongBird
0812550757|3|I thought Andrew Wiggin was too much of a Jesus figure in this novel. His character was much more accessible in the first book.    It's a good book, and you really should read it after you've read the first one.  I just expected more from all the reviews saying this was better than Ender's Game.
B009AMANBA|5|This is a movie you can watch every few years and still thrill at the ability of these gifted actors to take you to that time and place. It will go down in history as one of Hollywood's greatest.

B005CRQ4OW|5|This book is the best I love it. You have to read it this is a great book.<br /><br />  - need to read
B00J3ZIGOU|5|This is the best book for kids who likes adventures and who likes to  read the diary of a wimpy kid books. Jeff Kinny is the best for kids in middle school.
B003KJF2WE|4|I liked this movie.  The story made sense and the acting by Edward Norton and Liv Tyler made the characters believable.<br />The action is impressive of course, and I think a wide range of people would enjoy the film.  There is not a lot of bad language and other than the use of a lot of machine guns it's pretty family friendly.
B0010YSD7M|3|This movie is good if you're a Stargate Fan.  Since we don't have the opportunity to see it on TV anymore - it will seem really good to fans.  Not too much substance to the movie - mainly just going thru the motions - but it was good to see all the characters again.

B00382S9V4|5|I really hate how Amazon lumps in VHS, DVD and Blu-ray together. Often, Blu-ray films have unique problems that occur with transferring, given the technology is fairly recent.  You then end up browsing all of the reviews (tossing aside the DVD Ebert reviewers out there) to figure out:<br /><br />1) Is it worth getting on blu-ray if I already own it?<br />and<br />2) How is the quality of the Blu-ray?<br /><br />The second being most important, I can say that even though reviewers like A.Dent complain that the Blu-ray \\"skips\\" or is juddery in some fashion, I can assure you it is not (or at least not in the disc by design). I believe that the people on here who complain of skipping either 1) received faulty discs or 2) the manufacturer re-processed it since to fix the errors and I ended up with that version. I almost didn't purchase this on Blu-ray based on what A.Dent and one other reviewer stated, and I want to ease people's minds: the Blu-ray version is great and mine plays flawlessly. Seeing Brosnan's minute facial features/smirks/fake-surprise in high-def really gets you into his character that much more.<br /><br />To the former question of is it worth getting on Blu-ray, I can't tell you. We all know action movies are always worth the upgrade, but I honestly just believe you're going to be replacing it at some point and I'm somewhat of an HD purist and notice the difference even in up-converted DVDs. So if you already own it, maybe another movie you don't own is a priority. But it's only $11.99 (or so, depending on the day), so it's not a gigantic investment. Many of us are Blu-ray-ifying all of our old libraries, and this movie is one that's worth keeping around for a while. (I have several movies that I don't like enough to even own on DVD -- don't ask why I own them -- that I'll let sink into the great beyond of cassette tapes VHS).<br /><br />This movie is one of the few that appeals to both sexes without one taking a sacrifice. Every bachelor pad should have it in stock!
0316069884|5|I would recommend this book to anyone considering crossing over into vegetarianism. While this book is not a how-to, so to speak, it will no doubt encourage your journey to a more compassionate and healthy way of life.<br />  I found Mr. Jonathan's work very thorough and walked away a better informed and determined vegetarian because of it. Loved it!
B000005H4X|4|This was my introduction to Bu in my college days, and in retrospect it barely scratches the surface. For a follow-up, pick up the eponymous collection on Columbia with Hank Mobley and Donald Byrd. Also, be certain your Blakey collection generously represents, among trumpet players, Clifford Brown, Kenny Dorham, Freddie Hubbard, and Bill Hardman (not to mention Valery Ponomarev, Wynton Marsalis, and Terrence Blanchard). As for saxophonists, Golson, despite his compositional talents, is one of the lesser players to occupy that spot in a Blakey ensemble. Even when it comes to composers, if there's a \\"genius\\" among the Blakey contributors, it's Walter Davis, Jr. \\"Jodie,\\" \\"Ronnie's a Dynamite Lady,\\" \\"Backgammon,\\" \\"Uranus,\\" \\"Gypsy Folk Tales,\\" \\"Scorpio Rises\\"--these are all Davis compositions that Blakey saw fit to record--challenging, adventurous material that places Blakey in the forefront of modern, progressive music, a musicmaker beyond category as opposed to being simply leader of jazz' foremost \\"hard bop\\" ensemble.<br /><br />It's not easy to find, but look for another \\"Moanin'\\" on Laserlight. Recorded live, it features Hardman playing the title song like there was no tomorrow along with a cadenza on \\"Blue Moon\\" that Freddie, who introduced the tune on \\"3 Blind Mice,\\" could have played only in his dreams. Another good introduction to Hardman's trumpet artistry is the Italian LP, \\"Art's Break,\\" on which Art stops the band while Bill plays for half a dozen choruses unaccompanied.<br /><br />That's jazz. That's the inexhaustible world of Art Blakey.
B000003TA4|1|The Public couldn't take anymore bands like Firehouse, Poison, or Warrant and who could blame them. It was a good 15 or 16 years of that sort of music and it was getting old. When Nirvana put this cd out, it was a whole new ball game. It was so different than anything before it. It was also about the worst record to receive this kind of noterity. Every song, compleat garbage. No tuning, no singing, no song? Smells Like Teen Spirit? Not even good titles! The strange part was that there were so many bands that were out at the same time and were all better (soundgarden, Alice in Chains ect.) There will be bands like this again, when ever the public is in need of a change. Just hope the next can learn to play first.
B008IJTFYW|4|Lots of choices. Nice relaxing music to listen to when I am knitting or crocheting.
B001TH16DI|4|I watched disc one last night, Star Trek the Motion Picture. The set up options for audio does not have options for 5.1 or DTS or even Dolby Digital. My old receiver apparently cannot decode the 7.1 on these discs so my sound falls back to PCM. Other than that the movie looked great.
B0007KIFGE|5|great movie
B007HC3LHS|5|I really enjoyed this book. The descriptions really made you feel right there with the characters. Loved it. Will definitely read more by this author.
B001NLKXK2|3|Reading this book made me appreciate my mother's perspective.  It's a wonderful tribute to Alzheimer's with many meaningful quotes.  But, I do not think it was accurate.  Even early Alzheimer's stages overlap and do not advance quite that rapidly (monthly in the book).  I would have liked to have seen &#34;Alice&#34; before the disease longer.  We needed better medical details.  I also think a better perspective from the other characters would have been nice ( it's hard as the daughter) as well as how this disease is perceived and treated by friends, co- workers, and the general community.  Overall though this book gives a better understanding of how this disease affects so many lives.

B00594XOZU|3|I really enjoy kik but there's some problems... kik has changed since 2012 it use to be fun but now there's only old people over the age of 21. I think you should add something in where you cant be over the age of 21 to use kik. Cause as teenagers all we're getting are old people trying to get creepy and it's uncomfortable. If you haven't noticed more and more people are deleting kik because of this problem.
0553801473|5|I loved this book; I loved this series; I cannot believe the author tells you before the book begins that there will be additional book after this one, but I'm glad the story continues.
B009ZQ8FQG|3|I was not at all impressed with the ending.  How morbid are the writers anyway?  They killed off two main characters in one season, how much imagination does that take.  Do you really think you can maintain your following with that kind of agenda?  Don't you think we have enough of that in the real world, we need to see it in entertainment, too?  I think you have lost me as a viewer!!!!
140006922X|5|Like many of the trolls posting negative comments, I haven't read this book. And before I saw that Fox interview and saw the despicable behavior of so-called Christians trashing a book that they haven't even read, I had no interest in it. But because of these things, I'm buying a copy. I'm pretty sure Mr. Aslan would like to thank all you haters for pushing his sales through the roof, nice work.
B00003CXA6|1|Far too slow, wooden character portrayals, too much time devoted to speeches, the music score detracts from what's happening on screen rather than enhancing it.
B0089LOG02|5|A very poignant retelling of the shameful experience in our history.  Truly, the mettle of these children was sorely tested over and over again.  So glad this story had a satisfying ending.
B004DLPXAO|3|I do not know where to get support so hopefully someone at amazon will read.  I recently purchased a technical book with equations.  They appear properly on my kindle.  I mostly now use my Galaxy S4.  In that you CANNOT read the equations.  They are TOO SMALL.  The only hope is to highlight them and then select magnify.  This is VERY irritating.  The regular text is fine but the equation text is WAY WAY WAY too small
B002XBVQKW|5|Very funny
B006IND5M8|4|It didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie, but someone recommended it to me, so I gave it a try. I thought it would have a bad story, but it ended up being good. I would recommend it.
B00APUYWYA|4|It was a good movie! It could have provided more singing. It was a very up beat and happy movie!
B001HNE3NO|5|im so glad i read this book!  not only a great book, i learned so much!  a heartbreaking tale of the french role in the holocost, the author does a great job of drawing you into the story, alternating between the past and present.  i dont want to say too much in order not to give up too much of the plot, but it kept me so interested i didnt  want to put the book down!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|My first Liane Moriaty read, I loved it!!  Every and any married woman with a family would appreciate what the characters were going through. I found myself telling my girlfriends the storyline as I read it it. I also liked that there were only three main characters. It was easy to follow the storyline of their intersecting lives without getting lost. Sometimes authors introduce so many characters, you have to go back pages to remember them. It was a moral dilemma that makes you think how you would handle it.  A good read.
B00LFG2UMO|3|Good cinematography but with plot holes you could drive a miles long train through and, the logic of the premise needs a LOT more thought (e.g. really? How are you feeding the cows the upper-class is eating?). With the exception of a few grisly scenes and character reveals, I found this overly hyped and predictable.
B00IS87HYI|2|The game is fun but the fact that it wants $$$$ and I mean my hard earned real money to go to the next level is just BS! Games should be that a game and free!
B00A757EFW|3|kinda hard to play. The joy stick is touch, but since it's virtual, you are off it without knowing and of course your eyes can't be two places at once.  Not that great a game.  Really takes a lot of getting used to.
B001F0VHEM|4|I BOUGHT THIS CD ON A WHIM .. ITS GOT SOME GOOD TUNES ON IT, BUT YOU SURE CAN TELL SHE'S UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING. RAW AT TIMES, BUT OVERALL FLOWS PRETTY WELL.
B00005JKCH|5|O.K.
B00BD99JMW|5|I have gotten hooked so quick with this series. It's nice to have a great book to get into when you have a lot going on in &#34;real life.&#34; Be warned: you will get absorbed quickly!!
0385504209|2|Although the premise is intriguing, author Brown's prologue statement that, with few stated exceptions, all facts are accurate is somewhat misleading.<br />I think that Brown's idea of &quot;accuracy&quot; is somewhat similar to the way Oliver Stone treated &quot;history&quot; in his film &quot;J.F.K.&quot;<br />If the reader is less interested in complete accuracy than an interesting story, this is a fine book. The characters are one-dimensional and, at times, the writing seems workmanlike. Nevertheless, the premise keeps the fires of this story stoked until the very last pages.
B00KA7JIII|5|Game creates a soothing ambiance and has the right length puzzles for a mobile game
B0071XO8RA|5|These books deserve to be better known, and are a real triumph for independent publishing.<br /><br />The stories are engrossing, with genuine, likable (and hate-able) characters, a vividly realized future gone terribly wrong, and enough technical savvy to keep hard-SF fans happy.
B0014JKJHK|5|Love my Crocks and as always they are true fit and very comfortable
0307887960|5|Did not work for me.  Will give it to our local library.
B00W3V83QW|5|Another game that's lots of fun.  Tough ones too.  You'll enjoy it.
B008YRVW0I|5|I love aquarium games and this is one of the better games of this type I have ever played.  You can earn cash to decorate your tank and buy fish by simply playing a side game of matching three like objects.  No need to buy cash for the game with your own &quot;real cash.&quot; A definite plus. Thank you for such a nice calm relaxing game. A great destresser!
B00A1XOPE8|5|great quick read....
B00005JKN9|5|SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY REVIEWS ON THIS MOVIE I WILL JUST SAY THIS: LISTEN TO ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS FROM THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IGNORE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM ALL OF THE STUPID PEOPLE!!
B007PT3QOQ|5|This game is great fun.  Can be easily additive.  It has a couple of technical issue,  which can be fixed.
B007TNQ7EY|1|I thought this game was going to be pretty good, or at least moderate when I saw the description and the screenshots, BUT! What it doesn't tell you is that once you download the whole thing after buying it and want to get rid of it to make room, YOU CAN'T DELETE THE GYGABITE OF DATA YOU HAAAAAD TO DOWLOAD!! I would have ranked lower since the graphics seemed like something out of sonic, but I guess I have to wait to rank -5. If the producers do fix this for other people though, that would be fantastic.
B0099RFVXQ|4|Thus is a fun watch. Plenty of action and some fair acting to boot. Worth a couple hours of your time.
6305171769|5|I think this was a great movie and Jamie Lee Curtis did such a good job of reviving Laurie Strode! But one thing bothers me...if michael was finished off at the end of H20...how can he reappear in the rumored Halloween 8? Maybe it wasn't him??
B008XG1X18|5|I loovee this app, I'd recently started going on pinterest and on a kindle fire, its hard to view pinterest when its not mobile etc. (for me anyways:) ) and the pinterest app makes it sooooo easy!! :D anyways, I love it.
B00IMYSCR4|3|I enjoyed the movie &#34;Gravity&#34;; however, there isn't much of a story line<br />and it seems to be one escape after another!<br />Sandra Bullock does a wonderful job and I can see why she was nominated<br />for an Oscar: She is in nearly every scene: special effects are wonderful:<br />Very short only 90 minutes.  George Clooney has a very short appearance<br />but still ok.<br />An ok escape and fun but so unlikely.
B0071XO8RA|5|Fantastic, unique and spellbinding.  I usually don't do reviews, but this book kept me enthralled.  I would get so drawn into the story and time flew by. Great job!
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Best of all the new Star Treks!
B00DR0PDNE|5|It's great! Works exactly as advertised. It's so easy my 3 year old grandson can pull up Netflix on his Samsung 7 inch tablet and then play it on the tv with the chromecast.
B00CH26TL8|2|dont llike
B00BXKKNFS|5|I wanted to try anything that would stop my iPhone from being &#34;redirected&#34; to ads when I would look up something.<br />This works great<br />I just started it up..and it started to work
B004SBS8LA|5|I continued to have this type of problem so I finally got an Amazon CSR who helped me recover my apps. She was very helpful and now this problem below no longer exists.<br /><br />< I had downloaded the Angry Birds Rio Free and it had the free power ups. I then purchased the Eagle. When I purchased the ad free Angry Birds Rio it deleted the power ups and the Eagle. >
B0054W4JQK|5|Upon recommendation from a good friend I was thrilled to find 'Before I Go To Sleep' as a Kindle book. Having just finished it after two sittings only, I have experienced heart-pounding suspense, dread, unease, fear and tears in this utterly gripping story. Never have I been \\"lost\\" so totally in a book before. S J Watson - you have hooked me!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love the progressively more difficult puzzles as you advance in levels. It's easy to get addicted if you like a challenge.
B00L23SE52|1|I Didn't like the movie.  The Quality of picture and color was really bad.  Turned it off less than half way.
B000XUBFE2|5|I stayed up late to keep reading this book.  I loved the way the storyline played out.<br />I recommend this book.
B0062NAX1U|5|Great, wonderful Christian story, nothing offensive in this movie!!!!  Such a relief to watch something without offensive scenes or words
B00R4VIDMK|1|Drove me Crazy!!! You can't win.
B001L5YW9I|3|Daniel Day-Louis is one of our top actors but you'd never know it from this underwhelming role and an invincible Native American who never misses a shot. Predictable.<br /><br />A few good violence scenes, what you'd expect from a film made by the guy who came up with Miami Vice.
0439023548|5|This book was great!  I love this trilogy of books and highly recommend that others read the series.  It is a really cool series.  Love it, Love it, Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|4|Awesome game!! Very addicting and fun!! :)
B004QXJZXA|5|gift
B00AG6Z92C|5|t's really  good!. Excellent music selection, excellent voice, I really enjoyed it. It was a very good choice. It's not only for lovers, is for everyone who likes the best on international music.
B008QTVNUI|4|Not entirely believable but Claire Danes does bipolar beautifully.
B0015DWJ8W|4|It's what I would expect from Murakami. Reading for the love of reading is much like running for the love of running and not for the finish line.  As someone who enjoys running half marathons(and working as an artist) I can relate to alot of the material. It won't give you much insight on running, but it's an enjoyable read about his experiences.  Now onto more murakami books!
B00KWVZ750|4|Angry Birds Epic is EPIC!!!!!! This is a fun game for all ages. It's easy to understand. I love this game.
B0089EHWQE|5|Excellent with many heart felt surprises!
055358202X|3|George R.R. Martin was a talented writer who created a wonderful trilogy that turned into a quintlogy or an octilogy that will never be finished by it's originator.  It is now in the hands of a MEGACORP. Accept it as the unfinished work of art it is.  They will turn it into a Star Trek type franchise. George R.R. Martin you let beauty turn into gold in your hands! It is worth reading up to this point cause it is wonderful.  Beyond here... you may judge...this is where I choose to stop.  Do your worst MEGACORP!
B002KKCVPU|2|The lines on the bottom of the sandal caused my feet to itch.  I had to return it for this reason.  I'll keep wearing my old Tevas and wait until they completely break down to buy new ones.  I'd buy a 1/2 size higher than what your normal shoe size is.
B00005JNBQ|5|It's not a matter of whether it was good or bad or whether you \\"get it\\" or not. The human sense of humor is complex and unique in each individual. You can \\"get it\\" without thinking it's funny and you can find it funny even if it is poorly written or acted. Stop telling yourselves that your reaction to this movie proves that you are smart and that those who disagree with you are stupid. If you think that agreeing with yourself makes you smart, then you aren't as smart as you think you are.
B00020HEG6|5|This is easily the best Harry Potter soundtrack thus far. John Williams manages to capture a distinct and darker mood for the film. The themes for Lupen's talks with Harry and for Sirius are really touching. While the other soundtracks are OK, Azaban is actually memorable.
B00JB3MVCW|2|Good graphics, OK stort
B0015DROBO|4|I resisted reading this book for two years before I broke down and bought the trade paperback - for $7.99 it wouldn't be too severe a loss if I didn't like it. I assumed that because of all the hype that it could not possibly step up and deliver.<br /><br />It is not a masterpiece. After the dreadfully dull and hard-to-follow first chapter I almost gave up. I have a short attention span for boring discussions about business/politics. However, chapter by chapter I was reeled in until I had no choice - I was interested in the outcome and in the character of Lisbeth Salander, who shone so brightly above all others in the book that she felt like someone I knew. And liked. And I despised Erika Berger on her behalf, although quite honestly I disliked Berger from the moment she was introduced as she seemed a superfluous character to me. The relationship between her and Mikael Blomvkist was not so much shocking as it was just annoying. While it may be true that Europeans are more relaxed about such relationships, America is not without its own surprising number of such relationships. I've digressed - back to the book: I fervently desired for Berger to just kick off at some point, and not just for Salander's sake, although for the life of me I do not understand what was so compelling about her. More than once it was mentioned that she \\"purred for the camera\\" (blech), charmed the elder Vander (groan), or was in a royal pet at Mikael about something or other. Please. Lisbeth was far superior to her.<br /><br />The book was not superbly written nor was it poorly written. I am sure that some of the writing just did not translate well into English, hence the awkward/cliched phrases. The drinking of copious amounts of coffee and the eating of sandwiches did not bother me and I am perplexed as to why this was an issue with some readers. The violence was not nearly so rampant as I thought it would be, judging from the howling indignation of many one-star reviewers. There were horrifying scenes but these were kept to a minimum; certainly other crime novels, even ones written by saintly Americans (gasp) have contained more sex and violence than did this book. In a story about a twisted serial killer I would think that's par for the course (speaking of cliches...).<br /><br />I do think there was too much long-winded detail about business goings-on, especially regarding the magazine Millenium. I honestly did not care that much about its demise though I did wish for Wennerstrom to get his just desserts.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson does have a gift for creating a complex mystery and I truly was shocked at the revelation of the killer and was anxious for the resolution of Harriet's disappearance. But his crowning achievement is Lisbeth Salander. I just can't stop thinking about the girl and her haunted life. There are many wounded birds like her in society, although not so many have her prodigious talents. She is truly one of a kind and is the reason this novel gets four stars instead of three. Now I've just started The Girl Who Played With Fire and hoping against hope that the damnable Erika Berger takes a very long sabbatical away from Sweden and out of Blomkvist's life.<br />So - if you are offended by violence, scenes of rape and other depravities, my suggestion is to read lighter mysteries. There are enough in-depth reviews out there now about this one that you should be able to make an informed choice about whether or not the subject matter is something too offensive to bear.these were kept to a minimum; certainly other crime novels, even ones written by saintly Americans (gasp) have contained more sex and violence than did this book.

B000JMKQX0|5|This book is absolutely amazing, is Brooks the only survivor of a forgotten zombie apocalypse, the detail and depth of the book is the best I've read.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Do not play this game if you want to lead a productive life. It is fun but it's super addictive.
B006RJTIF6|5|This movie perfectly depicts what Americans really need to be afraid of.  Despite being made in the 1960's, it's very relevant to today in that some of our politicians seem to overextend the reach of government since nine elevn.  The 1994 version with Forest Whitaker is also very good.  IT's just a really good story.
B009NFHF0Q|4|Touching story
B00ET2ODTE|5|I finally got a chance to watch this DVD. It was nice but you need to watch it with your man if you are heterosexual.  Male with female. Stimulating. I will watch it soon with him in bed with me tonight. Keep in mind, this is not like deep throat  years ago movie. But it is again a nice stimulating dvd to watch with him if you feeling love......<br /><br />The name was just used for this film, Linda Lovelace. Remember? Nice, Ms. Chippy
B00192IV9U|5|A must have for ANY fan! This album is amazing! It's a Michael Jackson album not Michael Jackson's album. You can tell by the small imperfections that he would have never allowed his fans to hear. You can really hear the talent that this world lost. But, I'm sure MJ is rolling over in his grave knowing that Sony is taking advantage of his talent AGAIN!. Either way, I'm a huge fan and will continue to support the name. Rest Easy Mike~!
B002ZG98UA|3|It was okay, The first 3 movies make you anticipate something better than this; but there are a few twist that wern't bad.
B007PTJOV0|5|You want a fun game to play we'll here it is enjoy...its awesome..I really think in my opinion it's. one of the best games on here..
B00U7VDC7A|3|Great way to pass the time.
B00MB8P1OO|2|Well, maybe it's a little too early for me to pass judgement on the app. I was under the impression that the Amazon Fire's remote &#34;voice search&#34; feature would work with this app...maybe I just missed the how to video?!
B001MM28JG|3|You need to be in the right mood to watch this one. The humor tends to be a bit corny and contrived. But . . . Hey, it helped me fall asleep.
B00HFG3UC2|5|Loved the song when I first heard it in Despicable Me 2. I had to have it and was glad I was able to find it as a CD single. The single has the full length version and an instrumental version which I enjoyed. Such a feel good song.<br /><br />I kind of wished I had waited for the Pharrell's whole CD to come out. Its a bit annoying that I paid more for the single than it would have cost for the whole CD but i guess you pay for convenience.
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Very good!
B000M341QE|5|wasnt a huge fan of aviator, but this is on par with goodfellas.......great movie!
0439023483|4|The Hunger Games is set in a postapocalyptic world in a not too distant and very dismal future. The world is divided into 12 nations and the Capitol. Every year, each nation must send 2 children between the ages of 12 & 18 to the Capitol to fight in the Hunger Games, only one child can survive.     The book is extremely well-written, I couldn't put it down. The characters are believeable and the plot line moves along at a good pace. Given the violence, I was surprized that this book is aimed at children as young as 12. Another mom loaned this book to me and I think children in their late teens would like it, but I would not give it to a 12YO.
B0073LWEXK|5|The people that put that they don't know where the hints are&hellip;then its your fault for bein lazy and not looking! The hints are in the journal and with its help I finished easily. Its so fun I could play it again and again!! (which I do btw)
B00BFUUMO8|5|At the age of Four, and I still love everything to do with it today. This game helps to immerse you right into that wonderful world and is a cool experience for all age groups. Highly recommended.
B004SD5GZ4|5|You really can't function in the 21st century without this baby. Don't know how it works and/or what  it does,but my device works better with it then without it.<br /><br />Grampyz
B0028IDXDS|3|My son love love loves his monkey pacifier.. I wish it would have a snap connection instead of being sewn onto the plush toy.. if the pacifer gets ruined, it would make more sense to just unsnap n connect a new one. I think it would be more worth the money that way aswell
B00U7VDC7A|5|REALLY ENJOYIBG THIS APP.  FIRST TIME HAVE TRIED THIS TYPE OF ADVENTURE.  LOTS TO DO AND THE HINTS ARE VERY HELPFUL.  WILL TRY MORE OF THIS KIND OF GAME IN THE FUTURE!!!
B000WMEAKC|5|This band has come a long way in only a few years.  The songs are written by the very talented Ryan Tedder and performed by a great group of guys. You will find them very friendly and approachable at their concerts and you will find yourself humming these tunes.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
B007KUFDBY|5|Two words.<br /><br />SPACE.<br /><br />PIRATES!!!!<br /><br />nuff said
0670022411|5|One of the best written books I've read in a long time; I found it hard to put down.  Of course, one must be interested in witches, vampires and the like, but if you are, this is the series for you!  I finished this book, the first of a trilogy, and am on to the second book.  I'm so sure that I will love the second installment as much as I loved this one that I've already purchased the third installment as well!  All three books will be permanent fixtures in my personal library.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It's a mindless relaxing game with the most wonderful music. I can't put it down. It works all the time...no glitches. That deserves five stars all by itself.
B000009FJL|5|This has got to be my favorite of all early Genesis (except The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway). From Looking for Someone to Knife , I can listen to this repeatedly . My only question is that although this has got to be one of  the best , why has the record industry failed to release this in a  digitally remastered version as they have for all the others ..... ? I'm  still waiting !
B0094BB4TW|4|This app is very fast in terms of loading and is having good features but when searching for friends it takes long to load
B00OPMI04M|5|Meghan Trainor is so refreshing. Her debut album is so much more than I expected. This is not just another teenage diva with a one-hit wonder. Her songs are clever and fun with a delightful doo-wop flair, and her messages are empowering for young women. I enjoyed the album from start to finish. This artist is one to watch.
B00005JL78|5|top notch- best of bunch!
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great show!!! However, if they get rid of Travis Fimmel then I am done! Hot looking, great actor!! He makes the show for me!
B00HZ3C4N6|3|Good flick. Fun for Clancy fans.
B007REV4YI|5|The musical score for Skyfall is a masterpiece. Although I love Adelle's contribution, I am in awe over Thomas Newman's score. It is always a challenge for Bond films to do three things well: 1. Satisfy the Bond fanatics (count me in)  2. Make the current film's music unique- a work unto itself  3. Make the current film great.<br />  The orchestral score is totally recognizable as being Bond. Compare this to the last Bond movie- what a disaster! Alas, there is no solace to be found. I paid to see a Bond movie- and I want Bond music. Yes- this is my immature tantrum, but there is no need to cry now. I thought I died and went to heaven when the garage door went up an the Aston Martin DB5. Thank you Mr. Newman for that delight- it wouldn't have been the same without the classic Bond theme music! Chill bumps!<br />  Secondly, the music is so good- such a fine work unto itself that I am purchasing the score. Listen to it on your way to work or on your ipod while exercising. WOW. once again- kudos to Mr. Newman!<br />  Finally- never underestimate the importance of a movie's music. George Lucas had it right when he said it is \\"half of the movie\\". Star Wars is a great movie- but would have only been \\"good\\" if not for John Williams. Instead of cheesy synthesizer music, the full orchestral score makes it timeless. The Skyfall score is a huge reason for its success. One brilliant scene- listen to the driving percussion that electrifies Bond's fight with the assassin. It's an instant classic!<br />  Thomas Newman pulled it off- on all three accounts! Here's to hoping he does the next one!
B0017ZB8M6|5|I'm not into pop music, but this CD is just wonderful! It's enjoyable music and she's completely charming. Highly recommend.
B008JFUOVI|5|Excellent addition to my collection
B00L23RZO8|1|Juvenile.  Awful.  Don't waste your time or money.
B000WGWQG8|5|Sure didn't end that way as the cast, the truth of it is wonderful. Was unsure of casting as well, but they each are perfect
B001PJRAUS|5|I really like the modern funny parts , but even better than that, I finally started &#34;getting&#34; Jane Austen.  After watching this, I went back and watched Keira Knightley's version again, and enjoyed it more than the first time.  Then I got the Colin tv version from 1995 and loved that, too.
B00Q1KZTOK|5|The “Rescued by an Alpha” saga continues in spectacular fashion with “Rescued by an Alpha Part 2”, readers of this series and readers on a whole need to definitely clear their calenders and set time for this sensual and passionate tale.<br /><br />Tom finds himself torn between the two breathtakingly beautiful jaguar women whose beauty are just as dangerous and striking as their crafted to perfection bodies that is a sensual lure for Tom. This man undergoes many human struggles in this fast-paced story and Celine Yorke brought it to us in all its lure and multi-dimensional awes. This one sizzles to the bones!<br /><br />*Review copied to Amazon UK, CA, AU, DE, FR, IT, NL, MX, BR, IN, ES, JP.*<br /><br />Al-Khemet Book Club, Mar 2015
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is very addictive I absolutely love it. It really feels like you own a real horse! I would recommend this ti any animal lover's!  It is by far the best game that is free! On a scale of 1-100 it is infinity b/c of how fun it is!!!!!!! Thank you for creating this awesome magnificent game! I LLLLLOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEE THIS  GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1574216988|5|Sandy  is a wonderful writer always with a sence of humor and makes me smile. InThe way she givs hints makes you aware of how to see things and how to finish the exercise I have read the book so many times and see somthing new all the time.
B004MC0FO8|5|I was truly surprised at how fast Shazam identified songs.  Glad that a friend introduced me to Shazam; I use it often and must say it's great!<br />Tom
B009ZQC7MY|5|This is one of the best shows that I have seen in a long time. I love it and only wish I could get it on my stations.
B005K17RU0|4|This app is great. I like the way I can check what the temps are like for family in other areas.
B00HVJB4VM|1|Did not understand most of the book.  Needs explanation of stock market terms.  Accordingly, many things not understood.  Needs more info. About what happened with main characters and new market.
B00VFTAXUC|4|A long movie but effects were great and the plot highlighted some interesting concepts of time, space and dimensions!
0618680004|2|This is the first book that I read by this author and I am disappointed - I expected more. In fact, it was a slow and tedious read and I do not recommend it.    The main purpose of this book is to provide anti-religious ammunition and reasons to those who already are atheists or intelligent agnostics. To that end, the author provides good points.    Unfortunately, the book is too combative and sounds angry overall, offending religious beliefs rather often. With this tone, it is unlikely to persuade moderate Christians or Muslims to abandon their faith.    Perhaps the best points of this book are that it shows the damage of fundamentalist religion to society and explains cosmology and evolution theories that provide a scientifically accepted alternative to creationism. However, a much more concise book could have achieved these goals without sounding as negative.
B000P0J09W|5|Always a classic.  This is a movie from my childhood that I was eager to share with our 10 year old.  Listening to him laugh at what I found funny in my childhood was priceless.
B000R7I3LY|5|She's got a great voice, love the album even though it is several years old at this point.  Songs are timeless.  Can't wait to catch her live some day.
B002TXZRNQ|3|Ok tho a tad &#34;soapy&#34;, we do know all these life lessons but a good reminder if you wish to be reminded...
B00594XOZU|4|So, I'm pretty sure that you will like it but how do I update it? Because for kik points if I win it says I get a new smile face But it says I can't get it because I dont have the new update.😨😨😨
B00AAQRNQ8|5|This mouse is absolutely perfect. It fits in your hand comfortably, it glows, and it has plenty of programmable buttons, along with the ability to change mouse sensitivity on the fly with a convenient little button in the center, which is very helpful when quickly going from sniper, to grunt, to tank operator. The ability to change its weight is also very nice, since everyone is different, and prefer different weights on their mouse. Its glow is nice, and the mouse is all around, just great. There’s no other way to put it. It works perfectly for its intended use, and is very affordable, making it a 5 star product for me. I most certainly recommend this item.
B000CNESU8|5|I got this DVD for my son and he loved it so much that he suggested that I watch it also.  I did and it was really good and so true for today's struggling economy and papparazzi even though it was supposed to have taken place in the 70s.  I agree with other reviewers and think that it should be re-released at the theaters.
B007J4T2G8|5|I have always been curious about 50 Shades of Grey since it was first published in 2011.  I have heard a little about its controversial contents, but that didn't keep me from wanting to learn more about the book. I looked at all reviews I could, and many were very seemingly prejudiced against the book. I decided to download the sample. No harm right?  I finished the sample, and was quite hungry for more. I have been reading this title since yesterday morning and have been unable to put it down. I can't imagine why it has gotten reviewed badly. I have found it to be wickedly addicting. I hope my review helps you to form your own opinion of the book, and not to pass on it because of a few bad reviews.
B00881VLCE|4|fun game
B00004WEJZ|2|As this is review number 124 I didn't care to read everyone's opinion regarding this movie.  Overall I think it's a decent film, leaning further to the campy style than Connery had in his previous Bond films.  I own a widescreen video and the widescreen dvd. I kept the video for one good reason:<br />THE DVD VERSION IS EDITED!<br />When Bond enters the casino after disposing of the tubby bouncer with a cigarette case (or bomb with a tino gyroscope) the entire scene where he meets Domino (playing Centapede) is gone! As is the following scene where he buys her a drink (another \\"Hard or soft?\\" moment), as is the next scene when Largo meets Bond and invites him to play Domination with him!  This entire sequence is cut! Why? I don't know. Maybe Atari objected.<br />If you insist on buying every James Bond dvd, by all means, buy it. But be warned: you're not seeing the entire movie!
0596007124|5|Absolutely the best technical book I ever read.   It is fun, methodical, and gets the points straight cross in multiple ways.  Recommended to people who tend to bang their heads with tech books or fall into sleep with them.   Not recommended for those who love reading books others can't understand. <br /> <br />If you are already an expert in Design Patterns, you will find this book too \\"kinder garden\\"; but if you just started learning about Design Patterns, I think there is no better book than this one. <br />
B00HHYEOY0|5|I never thought that it would be the Grammys to bring to my attention such an gem of an album.  Also not a core Beck fan, but always respected his artistry.  Had heard this was more of a folk effort and now can't believe this was not already on my radar  - a luscious, melodic and poignant work of art.  Thank you Grammys for doing the unexpected (Arcade Fire, Mumford & Sons) again this year.  Past sins are becoming a distant memory, notwithstanding the exclusion of War on Drugs and Future Islands from this year's crop.
B00AIQP9DE|5|I think this is a great game to play. It's allot of fun. I really love it. It isn't one of those bloody games that all you do is killing and splash blood everywhere.
B002BWP49C|5|Love these movies.  Cheaper and available before we can get it in Australia.
B00FB13Y74|4|I got this game because after all its angry birds. I'm not that good on it yet but with practice I will get better.
B001J66RG0|3|Visually beautiful, acting and story are so, so
B007IXWKUK|5|Great follow up
B003F3FJQO|5|THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. IT WILL MAKE  YOU LOVE, CRY, EXCITED, AND ETC. IF YOU LOVE BOOKS WITH TWISTS THIS YOLLUR BOOK. IT DOEANT HAVE ANY PREDICTABLE THEMES, ITS ALL UNPREDIXTABLE AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE AND DEFINITELY BUYING THE DEATH CURE
B00GRPD0J0|4|Works as expected and no errors so far.
B00AC8ZIXO|2|This movie was slow and boring
B0091REZMW|4|I love that this game never ends!  I don't mind having to come back to check on my bar.  the game is worth it.
B005WQ4RP6|4|Hard for me to watch at times because I'm a little whimpy, but I really did like it, great acting.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is awesome and since flappy bird is off the app store, this is the game to go to
B00AEJM6H2|5|I play this game constantly. It's not as advanced as something online like bejeweled, but I'm just as addicted to it as I used to be to Tetris..I even see it in my head before I go to sleep if I play too long.<br />:)<br /><br />The occassional popup ad are a small price to pay to get this game for free. Definitely try it out.
B005LAJ17M|5|We have viewed the first two episodes and so far the story is interesting though we are not happy with some of the language gratuitious sexual scenes
B004ZGI1V0|5|Great movie, both me and the husband enjoyed it,suspenseful and didn't see what was coming, highly recommend , good for a date night.
B0069G5Z9K|3|Grandson loves it. Ok with me as long as he keeps the volume down.
B00DR0PDNE|5|You just connect it to your TV, connect it to an outlet, switch over to the hdmi input that it's plugged into and voila! You'll be streaming entertainment like it's nobody's business!
B00H4BVW8C|5|Great
B00CQZ65BU|2|This author clearly has an adjenda. She took great pains to rationalize every action that Empress Cixi made during her lengthly reign. It is irrefutable that the Empress was an impressive and amazing woman; unusual in her policy and many of her ideas. Her story is interesting and it is worth reading or at least skimming this account.<br />The author is much more interested in cleaning up Cixi's history than creating a historically correct record of China during this period. Viewpoints unflattering to Cixi are ignored or explained in the best terms.<br />In reality, even with the whipped cream account, Cixi was a figure to be feared as well as admired. The author adores her, I found her ruthless and vindictive. As for her effect on China, according to the author, she was the open door to the west and the modernazation of China. I hesitate to believe that is the case even after reading this piece of propaganda.
B000HWZ4A2|5|Sure it's overacted and not entirely plausible.....how can the jury find him not guilty when he admits to blowing up the building? Still one of my all time favorites.
B007D2XSW0|4|Makes my pictures come out looking amazing. The edits aren't complicated and easy to use and I love how I can automatically update my Facebook if I want.
B003WJQ74E|5|The awful truth to what we do to each other. I was so right on I could barely finish it.
B00IQE4NUK|5|I have always loved Coldplay.  From their calm beginnings with \\"Parachutes\\", to their experimental masterpiece of pop rock \\"Viva La Vida\\".  It's nothing new to say that they aren't considered a 'manly' band.  But who cares?  I listen to everything from metal to rap to R&B to soft rock to pop to dance and so on.  I have no problem saying that I listen to Coldplay and own a few of their albums.  \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" are piano rock anthems.  \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Fix You\\" will always be considered beautiful classics.  Many called them a wannabe U2, which I saw as a compliment.  Then they released their album \\"Mylo Xyloto\\".  It was also a great album, but it just didn't feel like a masterpiece the way the rest of the bands work was.  I love the album as it has some of Coldplays best tracks, but it was almost just trying too hard to be something it wasn't at times.  Again, nothing against the album.  It just wasn't as amazing as the rest.  So then I hear the new single \\"Magic\\", months before this albums release.  I loved the subtle yet beautiful approach of the track.  Another song was also released called \\"Midnight\\".  It had this Bon Iver mixed with electronics vibe to it and I loved it as well.  I had hoped the whole album would experiment in that manner honestly!  Then I found out that the album was going to only have 9 tracks.  Well, to me in order for an album to be considered a full album, it has to have at least 10 tracks.  So I was somewhat hesitant at first.  The album is said to be inspired by Chris Martins breakup with Gweneth Paltrow, and that just means that this will most likely contain some of the bands most emotional material!  Now the album is finally out, and I have given it a few listens, and here is my track by track review.<br /><br />1.  Always In My Head:  The intro to this track sounds very ambient and peaceful before the song really starts.  The guitars are very sexy and the drums will relax you as Martins vocals serenade throughout, especially in the chorus.  Great song about constantly thinking of an ex.  Good start to the album but it ends abruptly.  9.5/10<br />2.  Magic:  The beautiful subtle single that builds upon itself so perfectly.  When I first heard it, I didn't think it was that special.  But by my 3rd listen I found myself loving the track to death.  The layers and layers of the song are gorgeous.  The last 2 minutes are amazing especially as the guitars start to intertwine.  The vocals go from soft to a somewhat rocking ending.  9.5/10<br />3.  Ink:  This is amazing.  The guitars and the peaceful pop drums.  I don't know what to say.  Every aspect of this song is beautifully done.  The lyrics continue the albums concept of getting over an ex.  I really can't express how great this song is.  Could be a single in my opinion.  It almost has this delicious throwback sound to the uplifting songs of the 90s.  Its one of those rare songs that manages to sound happy and sad at the same time.  A lot of people are saying this is one of the worst tracks.  They really must be listening to a different song than me then.  For me, this is among there best tracks to date.  10/10<br />4.  True Love:  This song literally glides along smoothly.  Martins vocals are the main showcase of this track during the first half before the song starts to take off for a beautiful ending with some haunting but delicate guitars!  9.5/10<br />5.  Midnight:  This song had a mixed reaction from people.  Many loved its new direction, and many simply didn't.  I'm one of the people who love the experimental nature of this song.  Though I'm somewhat disappointed that the rest of the album didn't sound like this, I'm still glad this track exists in the middle of the album to calm the mood.  Yes, the song has a slight Bon Iver vibe to it.  If you played me this song and asked me to guess who it's by, I definitely wouldn't say Coldplay honestly.  But that's a good thing.  It sounds gorgeous and relaxing.  Toward the end thingsslowly get electronic without turning into a dance song.  Definitely a great song to listen to while taking a walk anywhere while just thinking of life, or to go along with the concept of the album, think of an ex!  10/10<br />6.  Another's Arms: The song immediately starts with haunting vocals from what sounds like an angel truthfully before Martin comes in.  The 'angels' vocals come in and out of the track and each time just hits me emotionally.  There are nice guitar moments toward the end as well.  9.5/10<br />7.  Oceans:  Many were saying this song sounded like it could've been from the bands debut album.  That made me have extra high expectations.  But when I finally heard it, it just didn't click right away.  I just thought it was boring at first.  I thought I would keep skipping the track.  But something happened during my 5th listen.  Something just felt right with this song.  The acoustic guitars and string moments really compliment the heartbreaking vocals.  The ending is drawn out too long though even if it leads to the next song.  9/10<br />8.  A Sky Full Of Stars:  This is definitely the most commercial sounding song on the album.  I say that in the best way.  Its a dance piano rock track.  The band brought in Avicii to produce it, and you can tell right away by the sound of the pulsing dance beat that floods the track.  The vocals are great as always, but there is this guitar part that happens toward the end that really sells the song most for me!  This will definitely be the big hit of the album.  9.5/10<br />9.  O:  Beautiful.  A great and subtle way to end the album.  The piano riff is going to be covered by many and as will the song itself.  The outro to the track and album features some of the same type of ambient sound from the beginning.  Amazing way to leave this experience of an album!  10/10<br /><br />So though the concept of an entire album being about a break up and getting over it isn't original, it hasn't been done this well in a long time.  This album did what many try to do but fail.  It made me feel like I was experiencing a relationship and then slowly getting over it before realizing how life goes on.  Some of the best albums were put together as a result of a bad break up.  Think Bon Ivers break up masterpiece \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\".  I can tell this album will receive mixed reviews upon release.  Many will think it's too short, or too different.  I can already see the naysayers calling it pretentious.  But mark my words, this album will be considered a classic in the years to come.  It already is for me!  This is the perfect soundtrack for moving on from a relationship or just any hard time in life.  Close your eyes and let the music sink in!  I highly recommend it.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|this game is addicting. So much fun. Don't rage quit. I love this game so much. People need to get.
B0009HLD0K|5|Breaking Away is the forgotten classic of 1979. The story of Dave Stoller the Bloomington \\"cutter\\", cyclist and would be Italian, who with his friends is in search of his true identity. Brillant performances from dennis christopher, Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern. Why Paul Dooley didn't win an academy award for his brilliant portrayal of Dave's dad is a mystery. The film did win an academy for best original script. There is justice in the world. While the film received a swag of nominations in other areas. A brilliant rites of passage film that belongs in every classics collection.
B00139W3NE|2|The main problem with this movie is that I never believe what's going on.  It's feels like a Narnia knock-off.  An adventure for an adventure sakes.  I never understood WHY LYRA.  What made her so special?  Even Nicole Kidman's performance is a reminder of the White Witch in Narnia.  I never really understand the dust thing and exactly what they mean about it settling in their daemons.  I thought about watching it again to try to understand again-but I just don't want to.  My time is worth more than that.  However, I suspect that the book is a lot better than this film.
B000MGB6M8|5|I have the DVD, HD copy, and now bluray. Simply one of my favorite. I find AJ to be at her most beautiful self on this film and I'm glad I finally got a FullHD copy. Packaging is normal, not the collector's type or limited edition. For about 10 bucks what I can complain for. Great buy!
B00NOPQU2K|5|Loved it. Great story with interesting believable characters.
B00OPMI04M|5|Great product, arrived on time and as listed.
B00006JIA4|4|I love Queen.<br />While these might not be what i consider the greatest hits, it is still nice to have a physical CD to rip in .aiff to my iDevices.<br /><br />One of the best parts is that when buying from Amazon, you get the free  &#34;cloud&#34; version as well...so I can listen at work via an app or via the web.
B003NX75B8|3|the double characters were confusing, but i was good overall. it supports gays and thats good. I didn't like the style of dialogue though.
B00ESY7QXI|1|It is quite possible a worse movie has been made. Possible, but unlikely. A wretched and cartoonish rape of an American classic, full of swooping cameras, over-saturated colors, too loud music, and overheated performances. Rarely does the movie pause for a breath, and when it does, brace yourself, because the effects people are about to unleash more visual overload. DeCaprio almost pulls it off, but he is about the only thing in the movie that works, and he is too often betrayed by whipsaw cutting and a camera that can't stand still. Perhaps most annoying of all, nearly all the outdoor scenes are filmed on obvious indoor sets with false looking landscapes digitally inserted. One hundred forty three minutes of your life irretrievably lost, time that might have been better spent pulling your toenails out one by one.
B00SI7GCJK|5|Arrived on time. Great buy!!
B008NCSZQ8|5|Greatest superhero movie EVER!
B0074PNCRM|5|I have never written a review in my life but i found this book so funny, sad, poignant and honest that i think everyone should give it a go. if you like stories about human relationships then this is definately a book for you. i loved it!
6303334598|5|If I could make one change to this movie, it would be near the end when Angel (Isaac Hayes) tells what happened to each of the characters...I would have added a brief cameo of Muriel (played brilliantly by Rosie Perez) getting her just desserts...I would show Muriel, working in a nail salon, with a bitter look on her face, slamming things around, with a rude customer barking orders at her.  Other than that, great movie!
B005LAIIFS|5|I saw this movies trailer and it sounded and looked good. When i finally saw it in theaters i was shocked at how awsome it is. I love how the characters are like one big happy family. Its funny and awsome. I would recommending this movie to many. I just hope they make a 2nd one now.
0385528752|5|Very insightful and very clever!  A must read for anyone in business or government.  It ain't easy to turn that elephant.
0739322125|4|I love Coben's stuff and this lived up to every bit of my standard for him.  Always unpredictable and captivating, his audio books are perfect for road trips!
B000002MFN|4|Madonna is the queen of copy cat's. I love her for it though, she does it so well. She goes to the places that main stream America won't go and sometimes can't go to  collect her data and then adds a few of her special touches and makes it her own before presenting it to us.<br /> With all of the hooplah about the &quot;Sex&quot; coffee table book this cd went under the radar which is too bad because it's actually pretty good. If you don't have this one you may as well get it to complete the set, the cd and the book...I know you have the book.
B006CHML4I|5|Attractive watch.  I've only had it a few days, but so far it seems to be very accurate.  Comfortable to weat.
B005J0VPNC|4|Worth a dollar, sure.  But I dont think the app is astounding.  It makes some pics look pretty artsy and cool...some look meh...then again im not much a photographer so what do I know
014242417X|5|Real tear jerker of a book. I enjoyed it a lot.
B0084AZXKK|4|Excellent story
B00005JNX0|5|I received the DVD in great condition, no scratches or torn boxes. My kids have yet to watch it but everything looks fine!
0307959473|2|I have no comment.  Bought the book, It did not seem of interest so I gave it to someone else.
B0044XRIMW|5|this was the veru best movie and I show it to my Grandkids. The music is beautiful. Just love it.
B00N6PD3GE|5|Larson recounts the events leading to the sinking of the Lusitania from several perspectives, including many of the ship's passengers, President Woodrow Wilson, the submarine captain who unleashed the torpedo, and British naval intelligence.  By doing so, Larson's story is peopled with an array of characters, each of whom in his or her own way, have left their mark on history.
B00KLF5J64|5|Loved it and the movie greatly. I will definitely purchase the next mix!
B00I6JOBTI|5|I love everything this movie is. Clever ending too.
B002U5HKZ6|4|Great description of Bombay life, exciting story line with strong characters. Felt some of main characters decisions seemed unlikely, but overall very good
B0091W7K6K|3|The car chase was neat because it was the first ever. The rest of the movie wasn't that exciting and hard to get into.
1401924751|5|Love them
B00I8H6X58|4|Good story line and amazing performances by McConnaughey and Leto. J Garner's character not well developed. As long as you are not bothered by all the &#34;F&#34; words, it's definitely worth seeing!
B009NPA3Q4|5|The music is phenomenal. I loved him on American Idol and I love his CD ! I am eagerly awaiting the next one!!!
0544002318|5|Exciting read about Scott Jurek's running & racing experiences.  I especially enjoyed the tips, advice, and recipes.  This book has found its home in my kitchen with my other recipe books.  I'm personally not a vegan, but have made lots of alterations to my diet thanks to this book.  Feel better than ever on my runs now.
B008Y7N7JW|5|Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Katniss and all of the supporting actors were great.  Loved the books, loved the movie
B00BVYNSLC|5|Loved it. Tatiana Maslany is amazing in her various roles and the actor playing her brother is wonderful as well. While you will have to suspend logic a bit if you are going to let yourself be absorbed, I found it a fun ride filled with good acting, dark humor, action, mystery and suspense. Hope to see more of this.
B0047VSW30|5|Awesome film based on the reality of organized religion, will change your perspective on  these institutions that still exist today, if you let it!
B00499K9E0|5|This show kept kept getting recommended to me and I finally watched it...all of the episodes in one sitting. I was hooked. From classic Sherlock novels onto the screen. Great stories very true to the original novels just modernized.  The chemistry between Sherlock and Watson makes you truly believe they are best friends. I cannot wait for season 3.
0525952926|5|The book was great.  I can hardly wait for the 3rd of the trilogy comes out. Even though fiction it really goes into the history of the time.
B0018PH3L0|5|I knew what I was ordering when I ordered this.  Had the movie previously in VHS and it was wearing out from so much viewing.  Love this movie, my all time favorite!!
B00003BDXG|5|the cuted seen of the court room is one of the most powerfull seens i have ever seen, and belive me i've seen a lot of movies in my life. the only movie i have ever eulised this one is  kubric's orange, i think that oliver  stone did a superrb job with this tarenttion script and i can't really  understand why was he angree aboute! i hope that in the future, both of  them cuopporate again to make some more psychdallic movies like this  masterpiss! yours, mikinox1@yahoo.com, israel
B00AN0KGWE|5|Very well done show. Interesting characters, sets and cloths. Some of the violence is a bit tough to watch, but life was probably more like that than not.
B00CH26TL8|1|THIS game is a waste of time sadly I got bored real fast with this one<br />Because it lack excitement
0812982622|2|While I don't deny this is a well written tale, I can only offer 2 stars. This is because the story was chocabloc full of torture, backstabbing, fear and recrimination and If I could use only one word to describe this book it would be \\"brutal\\".<br />Well, I know little of North Korea apart from the fact it has been and still is ruled with an iron fist by a despot. That the people are subjected to torture should they step out of line and are little more than robots in a sad and secret land. Whilst I was reading The Orphan Masters Son it was reported on the media that eighty citizens of North Korea were shot in front of large selected audience because it was discovered they had contraband television sets and were watching Western television programs. So......the story is probably not a stretch of the imagination, however it would have been a more enjoyable read if it was more balanced. Ok, there were specks of kindness, love and humanity from time to time, as well as a touch of black humour. However,in the main, this is a very bleak and dark read. Some will say, this is a ridiculous statement and the author would not have been true to anyone had he \\"softened\\" the blows.......HOWEVER it IS a work of fiction and he may have reached a larger audience if it was more tempered.<br />In the meantime I would not recommend this book to my worst enemy.....on second thoughts maybe I would.
B0064MPXFA|4|Solid acting.  There's also an underlying level of tension within episodes at multiple levels, which keeps your mind on its toes.
1878424505|2|I must be getting cynical in my old age, but I just can't accept this as anything more than four bits of common sense advice (like \\"Always Do Your Best\\") couched in a lot of New Age gobblygook. Don't get me wrong -- I **AM** a \\"new thought\\" believer and have a large collection of New Age spirituality and self help books, but this one is all hype and no substance.<br /><br />And sorry, but if the author is the chosen transmitter of ancient Toltec wisom, then I'm a Vestal Virgin. Be sure to buy my book on ancient Eqyptian wisdom (Rule one: Never kill a hippo on the Nile). Just $14.00, as seen on Ophra.
B00B2V66VS|5|great game really enjoyed it but haven't had time lately pick up my kindle and really enjy reading on the ke===
0446554995|5|I love the authors and all their previous books, so it stands to reason that I'd like this book.  It keeps one guessing.  I bet another book in the series is on the way.  It's a definate must for all Pendergast fans.
B004VMUS9G|4|I like the app for how many features it has. I will not however be using it. it will not get pushed outside my phone lock. this means I have to unlock my phone to get to the alarm in order to snooze\/dismiss
B00LU0P9L4|5|Lots of fun! Great graphics with an intriguing story. Keeps your interest. Recommend!
B002W1GCX4|5|This is a great buy, had all these songs on vinyl (except London Bye Ta-Ta & Ching-A-Ling) back in the day.  Been following Bowie ever since.  Had Ching-A-Ling on David's VHS tape LoveYouTillTuesday.  This is a great package, love the stereo versions.  This is very early stuff.....'67/'68.....pre SpaceOddity, pre MickRonson & TheSpidersFromMars.  No electric guitars.....orchestral.  Very nice!
B000F1IQNC|5|My DVD was in excellent condition when it arrived, and it arrived in a timely manner. Amazon.com is the best for online shopping.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Loved this! Great summer read.
B00NWLIW0E|5|I like it it's just like the pc
B00DSY8D36|5|Great
B003O86FMW|5|I read Hunger Games in one night and immediately started the second one. Fantastic series - fast paced and original. Put twilight to Shame. No spoilers here -- just get the whole series and start at the beginning you won't be sorry!
0143124544|4|Enjoyable read.  I'll definitely finish this one as the character's lives are deeply engrossing and I didn't want to stop until the conclusion of the book!
B008M0NDOK|1|Even at the price I got it at this thing is a waste of money. It is only compatible with a few GameLoft games. I don't think they even support this thing anymore. I see new GameLoft games come out all the time and they don't support this. So even in their new games they are abandoning this thing.<br /><br />If you have a game that says it works with this and you would love to play it with a remote then this is the device for you. If you want this to play multiple games then don't waste your money. The support for this is very limited to say the least.
0307455483|5|Thanks!
B002T9H2LA|5|Really enjoyed watching this movie, several times now. I greatly recommend it for one viewpoint of the Nazi Aryan notion of greatness being smashed. Though it is clearly fictional it succeeds in making it's point. quite well. Loved the movie fire scenes.
B00KGCNRAM|4|I like
B00H2EQFBK|5|Awesome.
0143034901|4|This book felt like a combination of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Water for Elephants.\\"  It is beautifully written- someone mentioned the constant rain- you could feel it.  There were enough plot twists and turns throughout to keep it entertaining.  While I figured out the main twist fairly early on, there were enough little twists to keep me interested.<br /><br />I don't think this is the greatest novel ever, but it certainly was fun to read.  I didn't have a long flight or a day to dedicate to it, so it did seem like it took longer than normal to finish it.  I didn't find it hard to follow the characters, but at some points the detailed descriptions were a bit cumbersome.  I also felt a little ripped off with how the ending was told- in a letter format, rather than in present tense.  It felt a little forced; as if after 400 pages the author was trying to wrap it up.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading if you're looking for something a little different, a bit more challenging than chick-lit, and simply well-done.

B0031KC8OC|5|I Love this show, watching again brought back memories of what I was doing when it premiered, and can't wait for the reunion movie!
B00IG7MRN2|4|I liked this g a me a lot the only thing I didn't like was all the reading you had to do when talking to the characters would have liked to hear them talk
B0015FHDRW|4|Remember how fun \\"Dookie\\" was? The band didn't take themselves too seriously (the first single dealt with the pros and cons of masturbation!) and the energy on the album, despite the close cribbing of the Clash (with a little Ramones thrown in for good measure), was infectious.  Flash way forward, and of course I was a fan of American Idiot, but also recognized that some of the songs were a bit too serious and heavy-handed.  This Foxboro Hot Tubs album is a great side project...SO much fun to blast in your car, really nicely done retro-production, with lots of little nods to the great bands of the 50's and 60's...sure, there's other bands out there that do this stuff, but Green Day has done it quite well here.  This one was worth every penny.
B0086700CM|5|My review of this game:<br />Absolutely amazing it's very addictive. And if your a first timer you basically run away  from evil monkeys and you have to go through obstacles throughout the game. But recently I've had an issue with the app the runner won't move side to side. He/she I use both. They only stay in one place like middle or left or right. Unless I handle it manually. But when I do that I bump into one of the obstacles and it sucks any solution? Please help with that. I wrote this big paragraph and I'm only gonna turn 14 on the 12 of 2013.  :D I feel smart and creative... O_o  happy early birthday to me! :D

B001HUHBAE|5|Movie - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />I've always found the mystery genre to be pretty engrossing, especially when it has either a perplexing case to solve, a long or epic narrative, empathetic or interesting characters, or a combination of these. I tend to get my fill of said sleuthing and drama these days from the likes of House M.D., The Mentalist, Castle, and Lie to Me, which are fine and dandy considering they're just TV shows and are thus somewhat limited by their episodic nature and production budgets. Suffice it to say, though, David Fincher really captivated me with his work in Se7en and its unrelenting visceral assault on the senses. Its shock value, grittiness, and downright dark atmosphere were such an eye-opener to the genre (for me, anyway) that it remains one of my all-time favorite films and amongst the top in its class. And then he made Zodiac. While I love Se7en for all that it is stylistically, I dare even say Zodiac barely surpasses it in three ways: 1) the fact that it's a period piece and thus, has more realism (not to mention a lot of this actually happened at some point), 2) is over half an hour longer, which doesn't necessarily add to the characters, but boy does it accentuate the plot, and 3) the sheer amount of obsession as portrayed by the characters of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and to a lesser extent, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.).<br /><br />That being said, Se7en and Zodiac are both crafty masterpieces in their own rights. But much like how Se7en infused the genre from a more emotional approach with its shock and grotesqueness, Zodiac seems to drive itself with much more technicality using facts, evidence, and frankly, a drier style of investigation to present itself. Not to discredit Se7en for being any less sleuthy, but I believe Zodiac to be slightly more enjoyable for its methodical nature, down-to-earth character portrayals, and massively engaging screenplay.  It's all about subtlety and attentionto detail, much like the aforementioned TV shows listed above, and I was especially delighted to see such a depiction over what seems to, historically, be a very interesting case. Everything from the production, cinematography, score, script, and even sound design have a very low-key feel to them, yet in the end add a real sense of fascination and awe to the entire ordeal and the events that took place over the span of the investigation. And while the case never was solved, Fincher made a very entertaining depiction of it.<br /><br />Video - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Zodiac was shot using the Thomson VIPER FilmStream Camera (a digital camera for those who care) and digitally mastered at 2K resolution. The result is a stunning and gorgeous transfer to Blu-ray. Black levels are the best part of the overall presentation with an amazing amount of definition, even amidst a lot of the darkly-lit venues and nighttime shots with all the little lines in clothing, shading, and texturing easily viewable. The smoke of cigarettes is especially pronounced whenever people were smoking them in a scene. Any shot of Paul Avery smoking up a storm, while subtle like the entire movie itself, looks great. Contrast handles perfectly with every bit of stubble visible on the closeup shots of Graysmith's face. Flesh tones, facial features, you name it; not a single visual element on any person or thing is lost or distorted throughout the entire duration of the film. I shutter to even think about how smudgy/blurry this would look on DVD.<br /><br />As for the colors, they're as natural as you can expect. From the various costuming of the era (late '60s through the '70s), I have to applaud cinematographer Harris Savides, production designer Donald Graham Burt, and art director Keith P. Cunningham for opting to go with a retro look on a contemporary camera. In most period pieces I've seen that take place in the '60s and '70s, rarely do I ever envision it looking as pristine as this. More often than not, titles like this usually end up looking somewhat washed up or a little desaturated through filters and such, which is thankfully not the case here at all. The clothes, their colors, and even the set looks as I'd imagine the '60s and '70s to \\"feel\\" like despite the actual picture being so sharp and gloriously rendered. My favorite scenes for reference are any of the office shots at The Chronicle for its ridiculously clean closeups, any part where people are smoking cigarettes (as much as I despise the act of smoking itself, it looks pretty damn striking in HD if you're any kind of videophile), or the scene where Graysmith goes down into Bob Vaughn's basement (only two 40W bulbs were used to light that entire room, which just goes to show how amazing the that Thomson VIPER camera is). This is reference video all the way.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5 / 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In response to all the other reviews I've read around the Internet about the audio being bad, I have to disagree with the low ratings. Yes, Zodiac is extremely dialogue-centric. It's a methodical, meat-and-potatoes, long-winding, and very technical investigation that relies more on plot progression, mood, and visual presentation for its atmospherics as opposed to the loud, bombastic, razzle dazzle mixes we've heard in other Fincher films. Ren Klyce's sound design is very subtle here with not a whole lot in terms of quantity, though he makes for it with quality. A good deal of the sound effects happen either in crowded areas (The Chronicle's offices) or in the more suspenseful moments (when Zodiac commits or is about to commit a murder). Dialogue, obviously, is not a problem. For all the talking there is, not a single line is lost, and even the phone calls sound very precise. The center channel does most of the work, while various background effects have great directionality and separation during the more busy sequences across the fronts. The opening credits is a good example of what I mean.<br /><br />The score by David Shire fits the period well, and the mood of the film even more so, and as we see the first letter from Zodiac make its way from the mail truck up the secretary, there's a very understated amount of depth and fidelity amongst all the doors, carts, typewriters, and telephones ringing all around the place. This is about as much as you'll hear from the rear speakers until the movie gets to other crowded scenes (people on the streets, visits at the police station, or any of the musical montages for the passing of time). Like I said, it's a sound design that's less about quantity and more about quality. For all the Fincher films I've heard Klyce mix that are on BD, I have to say the guy knows what he's doing. And if Fincher wanted to go a little quieter for this particular title, then so be it. It's no sonic powerhouse like Se7en or Fight Club beforehand, but for what it's worth and for what the film is, I'm fine with the way the movie is presented.  My favorite parts are the aforementioned opening credits (lots of busy bodies and noises, the scene where Zodiac attacks the couple by the lake (it's silently disturbing with no music, all the rustling grass, blowing wind, and stabbing and screaming at the end of it), and finally the part where Graysmith is in the basement with Bob Vaughn (for just really creepy atmospherics overall).<br /><br />Extras - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director David Fincher)<br />Fincher goes through many of the nuts and bolts about the making of the film. I especially like how he keeps everything in a sort of \\"present tense\\" mindset whenever he talks about a particular aspect of the movie and its filming. When said factoid or comment occurs, he talks about it vividly in great detail as if he were reliving the moment right there, only with the occasional anecdote to compliment it. I also like the fact that he doesn't get too anecdotal when talking about the actors on screen. Comments about them usually tend to be about casting, preparation for the role, and any of the quirks/experiences that occurred during the many, many, many takes he did with them on set. In addition, he talks about what it was like working with the real Robert Graysmith, Dave Toschi, and other people who were involved in the case and how the film portrayed them and the events that unfolded. I was also very surprised at all the parts Fincher pointed out that were either matte painting or blue screen backgrounds. They really fooled me the whole time into thinking that was just stellar production design. And finally, Fincher makes mention of the various parts they wrote took some dramatic licenses (which I feel worked pretty well).<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.; Producer Brad Fischer, Screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and Author James Ellroy)<br />The two groups were recorded separately and dispersed into various locations of the film, but it's an entertaining listen, nonetheless. Most of the commentary comes from the executive side with Fischer and the two James' talking about a multitude of elements from the making of the movie, the interpretations and themes within the plot, how the actual events affected the lives of all the people and communities involved, and various anecdotes that range from jokey to insightful. The commentary from the actors. has more to do with recollections of filming, acting (as well as a few stories here and there), and there own interpretations of the characters and writing. There's a wealth of information to be heard on this track that compliments Fincher's commentary very well, so fans of the film should definitely give it a listen every now and again. I only wish the actors commentary would've included Mark Ruffalo as well, since he played such a huge part as Dave Toschi and provided such a fantastic performance in the process.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />The special features are divided into 2 sections: The Film and The Facts (one for the movie and the other for the actual historical events).<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />- Zodiac Deciphered (HD; 54:15 altogether)<br />A pretty in-depth look at the making of Zodiac. It covers a wide range of of the technical work that went from the idea of the movie to the construction of all the sets, how they were shot, the actors and how they portrayed the characters, and even a little of the theme analysis at the end. You can play all the featurettes together or.. individually, but who'd want to do that? For those who are curious, though, here's the breakdown of the individual features:<br /><br />- Zodiac Deciphered (5:23)<br />Discusses the original rights lapse from Disney and how producer Brad Fischer was able to get it from the real Robert Graysmith himself. He and screenwriter James Vanderbilt had initially thought of Fincher from the get-go thinking he would actually turn it down. Obviously, it's a good thing he didn't.<br /><br />- Blue Rock Springs (8:09)<br />Talks mostly about the location scouting of Blue Rock Springs and how they chose a slightly different spot in the movie since the real location had changed over the years. Of interesting and morbid note is also the fact that they had the real Darlene Ferrin's clothes from evidence to make an exact replica of for the actress.<br /><br />- The San Francisco Chronicle (13:12)<br />Tells how they built the office from scratch and went to great lengths for the props. In addition to old telephones, they even went so far as to dig up the microfilm with the original newspaper publications from the real-life reports that were printed during the time of the actual killings. They also show a warehouse full of period clothing, and one funny little bit of Fincher doing 36 takes to get the right throw of a book on a car seat (that's dedication right there).<br /><br />- The Hall of Justice (6:27)<br />Looks mainly at the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Bill Armstrong. They show pictures of their actual counterparts for comparison, and the resemblances are remarkable. At one point, they even had the real Dave Toschi on set giving out autographed boxes of animal crackers.<br /><br />- Presidio Heights (5:06)<br />Talks about the difficulty they had with shooting on location (as alluded to by Fincher's audio commentary on Disc 1 about a Homeowner's Association). To get around that problem, they built a set to double for shooting and used blue screens and CG to insert backgrounds, houses, and vehicles. Needless to say, they did an amazing job that certainly fooled me.<br /><br />- Lake Barryessa (7:27)<br />Starts off with the real Robert Graysmith talking about how impressed he was with Fincher's ability to realize they weren't even in the original spot when they initially got there for scouting. And when they finally did get the right spot, they actually had to plant their own shrubs and trees because so much of it had eroded over the course of time. In addition, there's an interesting anecdote involving Fincher and a 1-thread alteration to the Zodiac's mask.<br /><br />- Obsession (8:27)<br />Discusses some of the movie's themes and how the information they compiled for the plot was actually not available because the police wouldn't release it publicly. This feature also makes special mention of the fact that the point of the story is not establish the premise that Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac, but that Graysmith and Toschi believed him to be, and that the real conclusion is anyone's guess since the case was never solved even to this day. Everything up to this point is either conjecture or just circumstance.<br /><br />- The Visual Effects of Zodiac (HD; 15:18)<br />This featurette covers the amount of stunning work that went into, what apparently, was the work of the visual effects gurus. Specifically, the gorgeous opening shot of San Fransisco in the opening credits was completely CG'd. Originally, they had taken still photos of the city using the Thomson VIPER with a longer lens and used those as reference for the correct lighting and structure detail. They also point out that Paul Stine's cab ride around San Fransisco, his bloddy murder, the Kathleen Johns, and the Transamerica Pyramid sequences were all either computer generated or composited as well. Again, great work by that team, I really couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />- Pre-Visualization<br />Blue Rock Springs (SD; 1:06)<br />Lake Barryessa (SD; 4:21)<br />San Fransisco (SD; 1:02)<br /><br />- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:32)<br /><br />The Facts<br /><br />- This Is The Zodiac Speaking (HD; 1:42:18 altogether)<br />A massive feature that gives a haunting recollection of the murders Zodiac took credit for in his letters. Each segment includes interviews from the police officers involved, various experts, and even the survivors of the attacks. Each piece also includes case photos from the crime scene investigations, evidence from those who passed (such as Darlene Ferrin and Paul Stine's clothes), and even vintage footage from the actual TV reports. The present-day interviews with the people were a lot more intense than I thought they'd be, especially when they go into detail about the actual attacks themselves. It's sort of an unreal and horrifying story to listen to when you've actually seen the movie and then listen to the words straight from the person that nearly died those nights. For all the emotions a movie can induce from its script, screenplay, and cinematography, I'd be hard-pressed not to say that this entire feature isn't scarier than the movie itself. Definitely give this a watch if you're like me and don't know much about the case in general, but areintrigued, regardless. Here's a breakdown of the segments individually:<br /><br />- Lake Herman Road (13:15)<br />- Blue Rock Springs (22:44)<br />- Lake Barryessa (37:33)<br />- San Fransisco (28:45)<br /><br />- Prime Suspect: His Name Was Arthur Leigh Allen (HD; 42:35)<br />Since the book was written by Graysmith and thus adapted with the source material in which he compiled for us to believe that Zodiac was Allen, much of this feature focuses on said assumption using interviews with the officers, experts, and people involved with the investigation. It's a fascinating discussion about all the facts they did find and includes personal accounts from Bob Cheney (the man that knew Allen right before the killings started) as well as Ralph Spinelli (who claims to have encountered Allen with some pretty striking allegations that made Allen seem even more suspect afterward). It's a very in-depth look at the man a lot of people believed to be the culprit and should definitely be watched at least once for any fan of the film or case.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />I first saw this movie in '09 when I was lucky enough to find the Blu-ray on sale for $13 somewhere and don't regret the blind-buy one bit. I've become a big fan of David Fincher within the last 5-ish years and really appreciate his directing prowess and attention to detail. I'm too young to actually have lived through the happenings of these events, but the occasional crime case (whether it be real or fictional) is a cool way to keep my mind sharp, and I find it spectacular when someone can actually adapt these real-world crimes into some kind of television or cinematic gem that transcends beyond itself into something even more (in this case, something of a retrospective phenomenon). The acting, production value, and writing are all stupendous in this film. It's engrossingly epic and obsessively entertaining. The video quality is immaculate in HD, and while the audio presentation is subtle and nuanced (much like the film and its writing elements), it's as accurate a representation as you could ask for when given the moments on screen. Best of all, though, are a couple of excellent commentaries and an exhausting amount of supplements covering both the filming and real-life facts behind the entire Zodiac arc. This should be a must-own for fans of Fincher, and especially those who enjoy murder-mysteries.
B008ROVTEW|4|It was a good movie for the children. I just didn't like the female bunny. She was way too voluptuous for a children's movie.
B00L436E7A|4|I download a lot of free games from Amazon. Most of the time, the games are total trash, but in a few exceptions, I find a really good game such as this one. Unfortunately, I don't think this game is free anymore. The game, for one, is an actual game. That is pretty sad that I have to mention it, but many times a download a cool looking game and it turns out to be wallpaper or a puzzle game. It has really good graphics. The physics are pretty decent as well. The only things I can really say bad about this game is that there is at least no option to have a human rider on the skateboard rather than just a skateboard without anybody riding it. Another thing is that you can only ride on one park and have only one skateboard option unless you make in-app purchases. Still, it is a pretty good game to pass the time.

B00005RHGK|4|I think what makes all of the old Universal horror films so timeless is that at the time they were released, there was nothing else like them. Think about it.<br />When Bela Lugosi donned his cape in Dracula, vampires were still a new concept to American audiences.  What was a werewolf, if not some old European folk tale?  Who had ever pieced dead bodies together and brought them back to life before Frankenstein did it?  Jeepers Creepers introduces a new monster.  One that kills and consumes to regenerate itself.  If we have seen this before, it was just in nibbles and sniffs.  This movie is an eyes-open full-blown look into the face of a new creature in our monster pantheon.<br />Jeepers Creepers was born in the late 1990's, early 2000's, when Wes Craven and his Scream franchise had rejuvinated the killer-with-a-knife formula that was started as far back as Psycho, distilled in the Texas Chainsaw massacre, and refined for the masses in Halloween and Friday the 13th.  The previews for Jeepers Creepers sure give the impression of yet another tale of pouty, posturing teens stalked by a masked avenger with a knife who wants to punish them for their sexual transgressions.<br />In reality, what Jeepers Creepers delivers is a throwback to the days when a monster was a monster and there were things moving in the dark.<br />I just finished watching this film for the fourth time about 10 minutes ago and I realize there are some glaring holes in the story (i.e. how does a monster go to the DMV office and get personailized plates AND somehow get the lettering to be uneven and jumbled in a \\"crazy\\" way?).<br />If you read my other reviews, you will notice I watch a lot of horror films.  If you enjoy horror films also, then there is one thing you probably already know.. do not expect perfect continuity.  If you watch an historical drama, then I guess you expect accuracy and continuity.  In horror films, that isn't the case.  <br />To enjoy a horror film, I expect a few things.  First, take me some place where I am uncomfortable.  Make me question my safety.  Make me feel that no matter what I do, I am going to meet with a gruesome end.<br />Jeepers Creepers introduces us to the \\"Creeper\\", a new addition to the pantheon of classic horror figures.  The entire story takes place during one fateful afternoon/evening, along a country road in (place you favorite southern state name here).  It is hot.  The characters are sweaty and you can almost smell them.  The Creeper certainly can.  <br />The Amazon review tells most of the secrets of the film.  If you are reading this, then what you really want to know is \\"why should I watch this movie?  Well, all I can offer is that it is different.  If you want a good, old fashioned monster flick, then by God you came to the right place.<br />i would give this film 5 stars but there are those nasty plot holes, plus director Victor Salva was busted for \\"certain\\" crimes which I must protest.  I must say that he did a fine job filming this creature feature though.
B002VPE1AM|4|I just got back from seeing Avatar 3D last night and the visuals are stunning. Just look at the end credits and see you will see every major CGI special effects company and product listings like 3D Studio Max etc.  Cameron does a great job of creating an alien world that he had a lot of potential to utilize and didn't.<br />Halfway through the movie I knew I was watching something I had already seen before with Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai[[ASIN:B0001JXOVC The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], a movie that borrowed heavily from Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves[[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].  Once I predicted the ending, I wasn't enthralled by the weak storyline.  Even the end battle was a diappointment.  I was hoping to see Jake Sully battle Colonel Miles Quaritch in one of those fighting mechs, which didn't happen. Yes I am a fan of Gundam, Robotech, Robot Jox, and Transformers.<br />Watching Avatar was a lot like re-watching James Cameron's Aliens [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]. In Avatar you have Sigourney Weaver, corporate antagonists, a strong military presence, giant walking mechs, cool military vehicles, and interesting aliens. Only this time the aliens are not out to implant something inside you that will only burst out of your chest later to wreak havoc.  The interesting twist is the humans are the ones doing that.<br />In a way, Avatar is a James Cameron greatest hits film that goes over themes that we have seen over and over again.<br />You have all the common Cameron themes including the dangers of nuclear holocaust, strong female characters, and humans and aliens both using technology.<br />I really wish Cameron would have told a less predictable story.  However, I am glad that Avatar is doing well at the box office to take the attention away from all the bad horror movies that have spawned up over recent years like the awful Paranormal Activities, all those dreadful Saw movies, and endless mind numbing Final Destination films, that make the average movie goer stay home and watch something from Netflix.<br />Avatar will be a good thing if Sci Fi makes a much needed comeback in 2010. Both the Sci Fi and Horror genres are at an all time low.<br />My overall verdict for Avatar is 3 and a half stars. Good for the average movie goer but bad news for the hardcore Sci Fi fan.vies, and endless mind numbing Final Destination films, that make the average movie goer stay home and watch something from Netflix.

B000R8YC18|5|Travis Binkle (Robert DeNiro), a Vietnam veteran, takes a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep at nights. While driving around, he becomes obsessed with \\"cleaning the scum from the streets\\", and in particular, with saving a 12 year old prostitute (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />It's sometimes hard to remember that Robert DeNiro was once a serious actor and not a semi-comedian who has sunk to the level of self-parody. However, watching \\"Taxi Driver\\" makes you realize how DeNiro gained his reputation in the first place. It is DeNiro's performance that makes \\"Taxi Driver\\" and without it, this film would have been long forgotten. That's not to say that the script, directing and other acting aren't also great. It's just that, the focus of this film is on one man's descent into madness and obsession, and without a convincing actor in the lead role, this film would not have worked. The intensity of DeNiro's performance translates well into Binkle's own intensity in his crusade.<br /><br />\\"Taxi Driver\\" has a reputation for the levels of violence that it contains, but with the exception of the final 10 - 15 minutes, it is actually surpringly non-violent. Having said that, this is a very disturbing film. Watching DeNiro practice pointing a gun made me wonder if this is what mentally unstable killers are like just before they commit a crime, and it comes as no surprise to hear that this is the film that inspired John Hinckley to attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />This film well deserves it's place on many \\"greatest films\\" lists and hopefully it will continue to remain on such lists for many years to come.

B00HUAP0NK|5|Loved the first Foster The People record, and thought for sure this would be a sophomore slump album, but I am pleasantly surprised. This album has less straight pop songs, but I really like that. It's diverse and has depth, whereas the previous album was lacking a bit in those areas. It's nice to see a band grow a bit and more interesting, without completely abandoning the sound that got you into them. Highly recommended.

B00B2V66VS|3|I'm not a fan of the first temple run, it was really predictable. but this one fixes those problems, just, not all of them. instead of running straight paths where you can see obstacles a mile away, they added twists, turns, and ziplines. and in addition to coins, they added gems. but the game is buggy when it comes to gems and hit detection.<br />first, the hit detection. I can avoid a wall, a fallen tree, and a tumbling spike wheel, but the twist and turns on the segments where you have to hug a side of the track is unfair, sometimes I will move to the side and I will fall through the ground. sometimes I will just die out of no where. and sometimes, I will turn and an obstacle is immediately popping up out of no where.<br />then the gems, I had 4 gems from a single run. I died (because of the previously stated cheap deaths) and I hit SAVE ME, instead of resuming the game though, it spends the gem and closes the game down. I just wasted all my gems because this games bug proofing is shown to have not been finished.<br />good game. too many bugs, especially since those bugs came from what might have made this game a whole different breed of running.
B0002V7OI8|5|I liked this movie. There was a lot of action in it. It makes you think though. What if this really happen? What would you do?
B003NX76BM|5|This was one of her better books.
B001RTP3YQ|5|I absolutely love this CD...Gave it for presents I loved it so much. I don't usually care for live concerts, but this is exceptional!

B00B2V66VS|4|It is an awesome app...i would recommend it.  Download it from Amazon, its fantastic.  You can tilt it from side to side and everything.
B00B4804KS|5|I have been a fan of this film since it was first released in theaters as a teenager.<br /><br />Setting aside the 3D for a moment, the blu-ray is crystal clear, with no visible film degradation at all. The special effects are still stunning to this day. The mix of CGI and animatronics creates a balance of reality few films manage to find. The 3D conversion is quite good. In the scene where the group is watching Hammond on the screen with MR. DNA I was annoyed for a split second by the fact that there were people blocking my view of the screen, only to have reality remind me the characters on the screen are the ones blocking the picture. Obviously the 3D is not absolutely necessary for enjoyment, but it does add another level to watching the film.<br /><br />For those with good sound systems the 7.1 DTS master track is as amazing as I recall from the theaters. It is incredibly satisfying to hear the soft rustling of leaves from the left rear speaker, followed by a chirp from the front right. The visuals may draw you in, but the sound is what brings alive the immersion.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of the film should have this on Blu-Ray for the visuals. If you have a strong sound system, the film has never sounded better unless you heard the original DTS track from its theatrical release in 1993. If you also happen to have a 3D setup, this movie belongs in your collection.
B000002MP2|3|THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM WHICH CONTAINS 3 GOOD SONGS LIKE LONGVIEW, <br />WELCOME TO PARADISE, AND WHEN I COME AROUND. RECOMMENDED ALONG <br />WITH AMERICAN IDIOT, NIMROD, AND WARNING. <br /> <br />EXPRESSO LOVE.
B006LSZECO|4|This book is full of twists! I did not like Nick or Amy but that was probably the point. The tale begins with Nick finding out his wife is missing and he is the prime suspect as husbands usually are. Did Nick do it? I enjoyed the different perspectives of reading Nick's side and Amy's side. Overall a good read as it keeps you on your toes!
B004J4WKUQ|5|Very good, especially if you grew up during the 80s!
B009UX2YAC|5|Great app, I love playing this game in my free time.
B004J4WKUQ|5|I couldn't put this damn thing down. It is such a well written love letter to all these classic titles from days past. It grinds deep into the pitfalls of solitude and provides a deep, complex, but fun treasure hunt story that you could say rips off the genre, but it is really just paying wonder homage. I throw this down as a must read if you are strong with the nerd. You may find it annoying otherwise. A+
B007ZGO7EM|5|This is a very simple, easy to use calculator that does everything I ever need. I would recommend it.

B009WO7NQO|5|My 3 year old grandson loves playing this on my Kindle Fire even more than I do. It is something that we share which makes it priceless in my book.
0553386794|5|I am one of those people who saw the show and then decided that reading the book was probably a good idea. I really enjoyed the show. I thought it was fresh and entertaining and the perfect amount of gore. I also love fantasy, so it was a good fit for me. This is one of those stories that translates well no matter what format it is in. I love this book. Martin creates a new world that is not too fantastical. This may sound like a complaint, but to me, it is a compliment. Sometimes I read fantasy books and the worlds do not seem well-planned out. The names sound nonsensical and everything seems almost too unrealistic. Martin does not have that problem. He creates a world filled with everyday problems of our own reality- there is lust for power and deceit and plenty of murder. He keeps the fantasy section alive with tales of dragons and a new element all of his own, called the direwolf, which is much like a wolf but a great deal larger.<br /><br />Martin begins his story with the Starks, who live in Winterfell and are rulers of the North in the Seven Kingdoms. Lord Stark's old friend, King Robert Baratheon comes to visit in WInterfell with his family because the Hand, who rules the kingdom for the king, has died. The previous hand, who was a friend of the two men, dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert's in-laws, the wily Lannisters, are the antagonists to the noble Stark family, and the current connection between the three families is tense. The King also faces opposition from Targaryens, who are the children of the king which Robert and Lord Stark deposed years before. Beyond the political intrigue lies the Wall, an ancient 700-foot high barrier that protects and fortifies the Seven Kingdoms, and is protected by the Brotherhood of the Night's Watch. Life is an ever-present danger, and it quickly becomes apparent that you either win the game of thrones or you die.

B006LSZECO|5|I loved all the books this Author has written..could not put them down and I<br />think Gone Girl would make a great movie!

B00HGJ18C2|5|Engrossing game, fast paced and entertaining. Graphics are clear and easy to manipulate.
B006LSZECO|5|This book deserves all of the hype. It is a great page-turner full of plot twists that you are never really sure what really happened until the very end.
0553378384|4|I think this is an amazing book that identifies things that may affect us in this life that belong to our past lives.  It's organized so you can go right to the section that is right for you based on your birthday.  Oh, such good opportunities to 'let go' of behaviors/beliefs that don't serve me in this life.
B00007AJF9|2|This film only merits two stars to give credit to the costume and set designers.  The rest is pure trash.  The script sounds like it was written by a bad romance novelist and the historical inaccuracies are amazing.  The characters are pure stereotype.  If you are intersted in a dramatization of Elizabeth's life you would be better off going to the old \\"Elizabeth\\" series with Glenda Jackson.  Even the 70's movie \\"Mary, Queen of Scots\\" does a better job with the same material.
B004LWZWGK|5|So happy I finally got my copy of the Dark Knight Rises. Shipping was fast, no damage, perfect condition. What else do you need to think about?
B008602KQI|5|Amazon has a much more extensive selection of movies at a very competitive price. Download was very fast. Great movie.
B00JVZ0DQG|1|Playing the check out of this game but not sure if I will continue. 9 days into a 14 day challenge they reset the goals so less people get the top reward (from 3 to 1). Why even bother playing if they're going to move the goal 3/4 of the way through?
B00B5HQLMI|3|I found the sound to be difficult.  Also, it would have been nice if the movie filled the whole Kindle screen.
B000GDH9JQ|5|One of the best dance movies ever.
B00HVLUR18|5|Love this headset! Check out my video review for it here.[...]
B006OAB6EY|4|\\"Innuendo\\" was released in February of 1991. The single \\"These are The Days Of Our Lives\\" was issued ahead of the album to little airplay, while \\"Headlong\\" fared better at rock radio. The video for \\"Days\\" was interesting in that Mercury seemed frail looking and in poor health. In November, Freddie Mercury released a press statement that he was terminally ill with AIDS, and then died within days. As is now well known, Mercury was fighting to complete this album (along with tracks that eventually would become \\"Made in Heaven\\") as his last testament.<br /><br />As such, \\"Innuendo\\" is a really solid late Queen album, as good as \\"A Kind of Magic\\" and better than \\"A Day At The Races.\\" Mortality was obviously weighing heavily on Mercury and his bandmates, as semi-autobiographical numbers like \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad,\\" Mercury's ode to his cats \\"Delilah,\\" the bittersweet \\"Days\\" and the stately \\"The Show Must Go On\\" all indicate. Brain May's guitar is hotter here than on many of their post-Game discs, on both \\"Bijou\\" and the epic title track.<br /><br />Queen's pop sense also was in full swing here, with such missed opportunities for singles as \\"All God's Children\\" and \\"I Can't Live With You.\\" Even though Mercury was in failing health, the band's tradition for pomp and grandeur continued with an album launch party occurring on the fabled Queen Mary liner in the US after Hollywood Records signed the band in the US. It's a considerable feat that the band decided to go out at full-throttle, with Mercury delivering some top-notch work. As the album closes, Mercury delivers what could be his finest goodbye.<br /><br />\\"My soul is painted<br />like the wings of butterflies,<br />Fairy tales of yesterday,<br />will grow but never die,<br />I can fly, my friends!<br />The Show must go on!\\"<br /><br />As far as the bonus cuts go, there are two noteworthy ones. First is the re-recorded version of \\"I Can't Live With You,\\" which originally appeared on the now out of print \\"Queen Rocks\\" collection, the other a B-Side titled \\"Lost Opportunity.\\" The passing of Mercury so soon after the release of \\"Innuendo\\" meant no live performances, though the Elton John rendition of \\"The Show Must Go On\\" from the Freddie Mercury Tribute shows would have been nice.e passing of Mercury so soon after the release of \\"Innuendo\\" meant no live performances, though the Elton John rendition of \\"The Show Must Go On\\" from the Freddie Mercury Tribute shows would have been nice.

6303540082|5|Madonna is always known to shock the world with her wild antics. In 1990, Madonna put together her most successful tour entitled, The Blonde Ambition Tour 1990. While on the tour, she had a batch of cameramen follow her around, for she was filming this incredible documentary, which showed what Madonna was like on and off stage during this tour. Her younger brother, Christopher Ciccone, makes an appearance as the set designer. Her older brother, Martin Ciccone, who is the oldest of the Ciccone siblings, makes his appearance by visiting Madonna when she takes the tour to her homestate of Michigan. Not only did her older brother stop by for her Michigan concert, her father, Sylvio Ciccone, and her stepmother came as well. Other appearances include WARREN BEATTY, MAUREEN MCFARLIN (Madonna's childhood friend), the father of one of her dancers, ANTONIO BANDERAS, SANDRA BERNHARDT, and many others. Not only do you get to see behind the scenes of her tour, you also get to see live performances from the European portion of the tour. You can tell they are the European performances because they are the ones where she did not where the I-DREAM-OF-JEANIE ponytail. You see, she kicked off the tour in Asia and then brought to the U.S. and Canada after Asia. During the Asian portion and the U.S. portion, she wore the ponytail. But when she got Europe, she decided to leave out the ponytail because it constantly tangled itself into her headset and it drove her crazy. The featured live performances are EXPRESS YOURSELF (the tour's opener), CAUSING A COMMOTION, LIKE A VIRGIN, LIKE A PRAYER, LIVE TO TELL, OH FATHER, VOGUE, HOLIDAY, and Medley: FAMILY AFFAIR/KEEP IT TOGETHER. This is an exellent documentary and all you Madonna fans should have it. If you would like to know The Blonde Ambition Tour 1990 setlist, well, just look below.    MADONNA: THE BLOND AMBITION TOUR 1990 Setlist:    EXPRESS YOURSELF (with \\"Everynody\\" dancers introduction)  OPEN YOUR HEART  CAUSING A COMMOTION  WHERE'STHE PARTY  LIKE A VIRGIN  LIKE A PRAYER  Medley: LIVE TO TELL/OH FATHER  PAPA DON'T PREACH  SOONER OR LATER  HANKY PANKY  NOW I'M FOLLOWING YOU  MATERIAL GIRL  CHERISH  INTO THE GROOVE  VOGUE  HOLIDAY  Medley: FAMILY AFFAIR/KEEP IT TOGETHER
B008HK3XU4|4|This case is perfect and the price was great.  I looked at the more expensive ones and thought I would try this one.  I love the color and the ease of use.
B001R4MEUW|4|very interesting  CD
B00CWY76CC|3|This would be more fun if you could just get a hint when you are stumped instead of seeing the whole solution.  Also some of the steps are just so obscure,  nobody could figure it out.
B005OZ4E3A|4|This is a great CD; I love Laura Pausini's voice and music and that hasn't changed. However,I would like to see her progress a little more in future....this album (while wonderful) does sound very much --too much--like her last several.<br /><br />Also, Amazon marketplace purchasers will want to check their product carefully. I too received the spanish version instead of the Italian one. In the end, Laura is Laura, and the beauty of her singing really transcends whatever romance language she happens to be using on the CD. So I decided to avoid the hassle and stick with the Spanish version. However, for those of you for whom this matters more...caveat emptor. \\"Italian version\\" may be what it says, but that doesn't mean that's what you get.
B00006WKSZ|5|All some
B00006J3T4|5|I have owned this CD for a long time and bought it for a gift for someone.  They love it too .
B0001I55SS|5|I liked that this movie was a clean family movie that has a good plot without all the bad language and scenes.  I would recommend it for the whole family.
B0001MDPV8|5|It is great. It  has a classic song on it. But this album is short and I am really dissapointed because it is a classic and I thought it was going to be better. I did not give this album a 4 because it is a classic in the hip hop world.But if you are from New York you can enjoy the album more than other people around this country. But on the Disc 2 there are 2 unreleased songs that are great.
B000R7I3LY|5|Who could know that a voice on a TV commercial could imprint itself into your head and heart.  I watched the commercial until I could read the name of the artist playing the piano and singing. I did a search and realized that I was a little off in my spelling, but it was well worth the research.  I've been listening to this CD over and over again.  It digs into my head.  Lyrical and throaty Sara has my heart.

Highly recommend this book to those who are open tho change and are willing to accept a happierand more peaceful life.
B00F1RR3Y8|4|I got this free game for my granddaughters, there are five of them, to play on my Kindle Fire.  The three oldest (7-8-9) really like doing the nails and decorating them.  For a free game, it's lots of fun for my girls and I couldn't ask for anything else!
B00FAPF5U0|4|I love to play Candy Crush Saga when I'm stressed and need a break.  Only problem is if I fail at a level too many times I have to wait a while until I can play again.  Wish they didn't have that feature.  Otherwise it's a lot of fun but very addictive.
B00622B3MY|1|My son (and both my husband and myself) absolutely love Cars, the original. We were so excited to get Cars 2, thinking that the first one was so great, the second one must be great as well.  We were very very wrong.  Cars 1 is a classic, an original and fun story that you can watch over and over and continually enjoy.  The sequel is nowhere near as fun, as smart, as creative or as enjoyable.  It goes from being a film for all ages, to a film for a much older audience of children but not as enjoyable for their parents.  Its bland, boring, and just plain dumb.  Total disappointment from these Cars 1 fans!  Spend your money on a different film.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Good stuff
B00005QDW1|5|I own all 5 of No Doubt's albums, and this is just another masterpiece! It may not have songs as deep as &quot;don't speak&quot; or &quot;simple kind of life&quot;, but it does have a lot of upbeat, positive party songs, and a few meaningful lyrics here and there. I'm glad that No Doubt tried something new (and it worked). If every album sounded the same, people would get bored of them. So you should definitely check out this album, it's worth every single penny!
B004EPYZP8|4|Matthew McConaughey did a great job in this movie. Though nothing was really surprising, it did keep me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Anyone who likes these drama/lawyer driven movies should definitely see this at least once, but I'd make it a rental only!
6300214826|5|This movie was great for the first hour and pretty funny in parts, especially the part when they are envading.  After that it kinda gets boring and very weird, I found it hard tring to stay awake.  But that is  just me, my dad and brother love the movie.  Its weird but worth watching.   HOO-YAH!   Thank all war Verterans.
B004UXUUDA|4|Ever since my book club read [[ASIN:1250004349 Sarah's Key (Movie Tie-in)]] a few months ago, I'd been wanting to see the screen adaptation. Only one theatre was showing it, and it was never very convenient for us to go there, so I waited for it to arrive on DVD so that I could watch it from the comfort of my own home.  The film adaptation remains true to the novel, but it was unexpectedly shorter than I had anticipated. Like the novel, the film also left me emotionally exhausted and haunted by the true-life events that it chronicles. Although Sarah's and Julie's stories are entirely fiction, they honor the memories of those who lost their lives in this tragic event.  Like the book, the film of 'Sarah's Key' alternates between Sarah's story, which takes place in 1942, and 60 years later when journalist Julia Jarmond begins investigating the Vel' d'Hiv roundup and discovers that the apartment owned by her family has a connection to it.  'Sarah's Key' is very difficult to watch in some places, and I found myself angered by those events and at the people who instigated them. This is not a film to watch unless you are mentally prepared to see death or mental and physical struggles to survive. Unlike the book, however, I felt distant from most of the characters acting on the screen before me, especially Kristin Scott Thomas (\\"Julia\\") and Frederic Pierrot (\\"Bertrand\\"). The novel's character Julia felt warm, conflicted, desperate, and eager, while Thomas's portrayal of Julia seemed to just go through the motions; I'm not very familiar with her body of work, but she did not use facial expressions to the extent that I would have liked to see. As for Bertrand, I absolutely hated him in the book, and didn't have a strong opinion of him either way in the film.  The two actors that stood out the most to me were Melusine Mayance (\\"Sarah\\") and Niels Arestrup (\\"Jules Dufaure\\"). Melusine Mayance delivers a heart wrenching performance as the young Sarah, who tries desperately to getback to Paris to rescue her brother. Niels Arestrup's facial expressions are such a joy to watch; he is able to convey so much emotion and I literally sat at the edge of my seat holding my breath just watching the most tense of his scenes. I've since seen him in 'War Horse' and I look forward to seeing him in many things to come.  Bonus Features:  These are definitely worth taking the time to watch; you'll learn about the author Tatiana de Rosnay's road to publication as well as the development of this film, meet Melusine Mayance and hear the director speak about her, and see what life is like on set in between filming.
0544340620|5|Every book in this series is fabulous!
6304383827|5|This is another Jane Austen story. Emma is very likable and she seems to think she is a very good matchmaker. Loved the movie.
B0024FAR5M|5|This is just an all around great show.  Sure, it can be over the top at moments, but the plot and characters are well written and highly entertaining.
B007FEFLTO|5|Ken Follet continues to weave fiction with non-fiction in this absorbing sequel. The story and characters are so well developed that you have a hard time putting the volume down. I have already pre-ordered volume 3 and anxiously await it's release in August of 2014.

B007BVOEPI|5|This is the first season of a particularly excellent show, my favorite of all TV thus far, and I know many who feel similarly about it. Definitely fun to watch if you like fantasy and drama.
B003O86FMW|5|I could not put it down! I have a Kindle with over 50 books on it so after reading the Hunger Games, I immediately purchased this one. My first Kindle purchase!
B001IBIHQ4|5|One of the best set of DVDs I have ever purchased. Saw it when it ran on HBO and it keep me glued to the TV. Now I can watch it anytime with no breaks in the total story. As a Vietnam Veteran I found myself absorbed with the charters, and somehow gained a brother hood to our WWII vets I never had before.
B00BN3EE1O|5|Let me first start off saying that I was one of those movie-goers who had the advantage of seeing Safe Haven on opening night with my husband. Since it's release I have went back two other times to the Cinema because the first go around kept me wanting more. To sum it up, that is exactly what Safe Haven does...it keeps the audience wanting more.<br /><br />  Nicholas Sparks has a way of pulling the heart strings of young adult readers world wide and when one of his books hits the Cinema you better watch out for a stampede of avid book worms alike. The chemistry between Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel is intoxicating! You are immediately swept off your feet with Southport, North Carolina and the charm of it's close knit community. The musical score of the movie is superb. Blending seamlessly throughout the picture and leaving you humming the quaint tunes out of the theater.<br /><br />  I won't go into the story line as other reviews had. But,I would say to give this movie an honest chance. It has real heart and is definitely a suspenseful chick flick that makes even the male audience intrigued.
B00H3JHFOK|4|This is a movie for which you have to pay attention and think about what is happening on the screen, if you do not pay attention you will soon be totally lost and the movie will seem to be chaos. M-Theory, or more precisely the existence of infinite dimensions, is the basis for the plot with infinite pre-birth knowledge also thrown in. You do not have to understand M-Theory to follow the movie, the relevant aspects are explained in the movie without getting into the boring details. Also this movie's version of infinite pre-birth knowledge is explained near the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />This paragraph may be a slight spoiler but on the other hand it might help in understanding the movie sooner, it is a bit confusing at first. The jumping of time and timelines (AKA dimensions) reminded me of &#34;The Butterfly Effect&#34; however in this movie instead of the main character traveling back in time and changing the timeline as of the point in time he jumped back to then returning to a drastically changed present, he is simply remembering all of the dimensions simultaneously while he himself seems to be in a dimension in which he did not previously exist. The jumping around in time and sometimes being confused about where in the timeline he is (or which timeline he is in), and to a lesser extent having foreknowledge of what will happen, is what reminded me of &#34;Slaughterhouse-Five&#34;. But this movie does not have the aliens and nudity which &#34;Slaughterhouse-Five&#34; has.<br /><br />There is a revelation at the end of the movie which puts things into prospective, but I will not give a hint of what that is.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I love love love this show, and I don't have cable so I'm glad I can watch it on amazon prime!

B0013TXA5Y|5|Loved it.  Funny, romantic, and fast-paced.  Great characters--Jace, Simon, Magnus Bane.  Kept me up late into the night reading.
B008QE9XD2|5|Not a fan of Tim Burton, HOWEVER, Johnny Depp, is another story. After renting on Netflix. had to add this to my DVD collection. Loved the music tracks also, !!
B008IJT0CE|5|I love the sounds on this app. Although there aren't alot of them, about a dozen or so I think, they are very nice, soothing, and you can play several together if you want, like rain, thunder, and chimes as just an example. I recommend this app over another one out there called Sleepy Time that I wish I hadn't paid for.
B002UM5BXW|3|This is an odd book. If you are not interested in the food industry, then it is probably not going to be very interesting to you. It is not poorly written, but quite limited in its content. He uses questionable language in much of the book. The best part is his description of his first trip to France. BAM
B0081SRJSY|4|Fun game. Plays faster than the board game which is always nices. has some glitches but overall worth the price of $0
B00U7VDC7A|4|Fun game. I have trouble finding a lot of the items required. They are impossible to see on my screen but the hints work. I'm enjoying playing.

B0012GTZC0|5|Interesting historical background to a real thriller.  Excellent character development.  It was very hard to put down.<br />Great book for the beach
B003Y2BMVC|5|I was largely surprised. When I first went to see this movie back when it was in theaters, I didn't like it all that much. My cousins did, but I didn't. I was bored by it somehow. But I learned over time that that depended on my nine-year-old tastes and that tastes sometimes change. This movie finally grew on me last year. It came up on Netflix along with a whole slew of Disney movies I hadn't seen on there before and I went on a binge. I decided what the hey and watched it later on. I'm so glad I gave it another chance!<br /><br />The animation, music scores and storytelling really make this one a gem. It does go a bit slow however and I think that that's what made me not like it as a child.<br /><br />This is a story about a young man named Jim Hawkins, who lives with his mother at an inn and tavern that she runs on a planet very similar to Earth. He wants to feel the freedom of thrills and adventure, but is stuck helping his mother with the inn quite often. One day, a strange, alien like creature appears &#34;shipwrecked&#34; at their back door (he was a pirate). He passes away, leaving behind a map that leads to a legendary treasure. Jim takes it to a family friend, a sentient- actually genius- dog like character who has been researcher for years and shows it to him (although before this, he didn't know it was the map really). He convinces him to help him get his mother to let him take a voyage to look for the lost treasure. A captain, crew and ship are assigned for the task. The captain seems very strict yet kind (she's a creature based on felines) and the crew looks mean (most of them are various aliens, some looking like insects, others dripped slime, some having hooks for hands, some having eight legs, etc) ... Jim is added on board as an assistant to the ship's galley cook, a sort of rough looking cyborg. At this point, the adventure looks like it just couldn't get any worse to Jim...<br /><br />The story really has it's emotional ups and downs and quite afew great laughs as well. There is also a romance that goes on in the &#34;sidelines&#34; of the story that I find highly adorable. ;)<br /><br />Also a great Fathers Day kind of movie. Jim grows up without a father since his father leaves and never comes back, but the relationship he establishes with a father figure in this movie is one of the most touching relationships in any Disney movie... Probably second only to that of one of the following:<br /><br />Bambi and his mother<br /><br />Dumbo and his mother<br /><br />Lilo and Nani from Lilo & Stitch<br /><br />Brother Bear's Kenai and Koda<br /><br />(None of them are father-son, but they are good comparison for the level of strength of the relationship)<br /><br />This movie is highly entertaining and even more of a blast for those of us who are sci-fi or steam punk fanatics.
B000002GIE|4|Debut album by big hair rockers from Boston, this little package is full of raw guitar rock suited to fit any style.  Despite this taste of music being somewhat of a garage sale nostalgia nowadays, it still is something to note given some great singing by Gary Cherone and guitar playing by Nuno Bettencourt.  As the pro review on this page reveals, there were Van Halen influences and that was not a bad thing when Extreme entered the picture.  Little Girls, Play with Me and Mother don't wanna go to school today are all fun and user friendly.  No quite their best but for a debut album it still remains a great one to me.
B00475AYJQ|5|This series was the first I've been excited about since Game of Thrones, The Wheel of Time, and The Magician. So happy I came across these books.

B000Q66PXE|5|Perfect.  What more needs to be said.  Prompt shipping very well packaged.  I highly recommend this seller.
B00I2TV3NO|4|Exciting extension of the original Hunger Games movie. The story seemed to flow well along the path originally created by the first one. I did not read the books, and therefore am not tainted by any preconceived ideas of what the series should be. For me it was just another nice adaption of a post apocalyptic government gone power hungry, and then put in its place by the subjugated underdogs, love story.
B008AK8FHM|4|This was well written (lots of technical information) and held my interest throughout.  Got this book because of a recommendation from a friend and enjoyed it very much.
0812979680|5|This was my annual present to my friends, colleagues two years ago. Antifragility is important to understand, especially in these times of rapid change, and need for flexibility.
B00LP9E79U|5|Although violent and dark I found this movie very entertaining. It was nice to see a new take on the subject and not another half-cocked recycle of previous movies. If you are a fan of the class warfare-esque type movies (Hunger Games, Equilibrium, etc.) you will enjoy this movie.
B006885FZI|4|Very intimate story into the experiences of three marines during the Battles of the pacific and their personal lives.
B006OCM0G0|5|I think this is a great app to have! Anything you want for an app is on this one! Loving it. Finally merp.
B0063IH60K|5|Easy to play, once you pick it up to have a \\"quick game\\" that's it you can't stop playing! You don't need any brains or skill to play it so the whole family can join in. Also has a function allowing multi-play. Great game thank you
B00EMXBDMA|5|So many have review this book before me, and I don't hold any illusions that I could summarize the plot better than they have.  Knowing this, I will simply tell you why I enjoyed this book so much.  I'm a fan of many genres in fiction... romance, paranormal, horror, sci-fi, and even fantasy on occasion.  Within the sci-fi genre, I've never been a huge fan of books that involve too much actual science.  I've always preferred the human part of the stories more than the technical aspects.  The Martian however, is the best of both.  Watney was such a fantastic character. To me, his incredible sense of humor was just as much a tool for his survival as his technical knowledge.  The &#34;science-y&#34; (yes, I just made that word up) parts, though very technical to me at least, were just as entertaining.  It was like he was living in a choose your own adventure book.  If you make this decision, it leads to these consequences and now you need a solution.  This was a really inspiring story that balanced human nature, technical knowledge and humor in a beautiful way.  Congrats to Mr. Weir for a great read!
0385732554|4|This is a short read and listed as YA but don't let that fool you. It packs quite a punch in imagining what a world would be if everyone was the same. And if everyone was the same what would happen if you were faced with knowing the world had differences. It would be akin to describing color to the blind or music to the deaf. If we were all blind and deaf the scariest part would be seeing and hearing for the first time. Our brains would have difficulty in comprehending and processing the new stimuli. This is the dilemma our main character faces.  The aspect that frustrated me was that the way this world came about was never really explained but I can forgive that because it wasn't the focus of the story.  Spend a couple hours to read this little gem. It is well worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I think that this is a great game for all you fellow minion lovers. My advice is to buy this game right now
B00005JM09|2|When science fiction movies like those based in the future or have something to do with it, generally receive huge amounts of appreciation and become increasingly popular, one does not quite resent the idea of watching one of the genre.<BR>I have not watched the first two of the Terminator series, so my views are free from that kind of comparison. <BR>What did I expect from the movie? Thrilling sound-effects and breath-taking visual sequences.<BR>The sound-effects were good and certain scenes showing blasts and the use of their weapons by the Terminator and the Anti-terminator were almost impressive. The attempt at comic relief has proved successful. The computer's view on various subjects was interesting.<BR>However, the movie is basically an endless chase with plenty of 'booms' and 'bangs'. The story is hardly thought-provoking; it does not have that 'unique' and 'unbelievable' and 'interestingly logical' feel to it.<BR>For all those who enjoy raw action, watch the movie, enjoy, HAVE A BLAST!
B000UJCALI|5|Although Stephen King HATED this movie, it'll still scare the bejeezus out of you no matter how many times you've seen it. Luckily for Angelinos, artifacts from the film are currently on display at the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art along with film clips through mid 2013.
B00008EY65|4|I had almost zero good expectations for Hellboy. I had never read the comic. When I saw the preview, I thought this movie looked like the dumbest flick this side of \\"Wild, Wild West\\". I had no plans on seeing it whatsoever. At least not in the theaters. Then it came out and reviewers were giving it very positive remarks. So, I was intrigued. I bought the movie the day it came out and I am happy to say I am not disappointed.<br /><br />Hellboy is based on a comic book, as many of you already know. The movie stays true to the comic, but takes some liberties that actually improve the movie version, in my opinion. The background of Hellboy is an interesting one. Back in WWII, Hitler was researching the paranormal. He then sent Rasputin (the badguy) to try to capture a beast from another dimension (hell) who would come to our world and start the apocolypse. Rasputin builds this portal-like device and was in the process of bringing Hellboy to our world when a scientist, accompanied by the US Marines, interfere and end up screwing it all up. Hellboy still comes through the portal, but he is in the hands of good not evil. Hellboy then lives with other humans and adapts some of our bad habits, emotions, etc. He now fights on our side against monsters and helps humanity. Of course, Rasputin (still alive, can't be killed) has other ideas. That is where the conflict comes in.<br /><br />Hellboy is not just a regular comic book movie. Sure it has a hero, villain, lots of action, lots of special effects, etc. But, it also has the constant struggle of the Hellboy character trying to be normal in a world of humans. He fights for humanity, even though most of the world would call him a monster and want him dead. I know it sounds like the X-men mutants, but it's not quite like that. The story has a deeper, more emotional side that I didn't expect at all. That's what seperates it from the Spidermans of the industry. Not that I didn't like the Spiderman movies, it's just nice to see something more unique.<br /><br />Ron Pearlman plays the character Hellboy and does it absolutely perfect. I don't think there was another actor that could have played this part. He has the right look and has no trouble spouting off the one-liners that the character has. He likes beer, cigars, women and other stuff that any other man would like. He just happens to be tall, strong, blood red, and has horns coming out of his forehead. Pearlman was the perfect choice to play the lead here.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does a very good job, as well. Karel Roden plays the villain, and does a great job. Selma Blair plays the love interest here. I haven't really liked her much in any of her movies, but she impressed me here. John Hurt, a classic actor, takes on the role of the scientist that discovers Hellboy. He then basically raises him like a father & is very close to him. Do I even had to say if Hurt was a good choice for this part? He is a great actor. Overall the acting was solid all around. The movie was directed by Guillermo Del Toro (Blade 2). I think this is his best work to date and if there is a sequal, I hope he is heading that one, as well.<br /><br />If you like comic book movies, I think you should check this out. It's not your typical one, but if you can look past the goofy looking lead character and strange story, you will find a very surprising movie. I can highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />Special Features: Where do I start? This 2-disc set is LOADED. There are 2 different commentaries, set visits, storyboard track and recommendations. And that's just the first disc. On disc two, you get a two hour documentary on the making of the movie. The way the documentary was made, it kinda makes me think of the ones on the Lord Of The Rings extended edition sets. Very well done, and worth the price of admission itself. You get a few deleted & extended scenes, all with audio commentary if you so choose. There are character bios, animatics, trailers, film bios and more. Like I said, this movie is aboslutely crammed with special features. I almost gave this DVD a fifth start just for the supplements alone.lers, film bios and more.

B00G32TD98|5|very scary and great cinematography/camera work.<br /><br />watched it with my wife and we both enjoyed it. you will too. :)
B00FJ2YTLK|5|This is just about the most amazing book I've ever read. I can't believe how well Kiera mixes her romance, adventure, drama, and everything else. i love this book! WAY TO GO, KIERA!
B006LSZECO|4|Book is far better than the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5|This is fun like temple run but I love temple run 2 more.<br />If you don't have temple run 2 you should get it because its fun<br /><br />.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this app!!  every time I get on my kindle I play it! it is very realistic and so fun!!
B001U9BRNE|5|I saw and heard this in a Bose store and was blown away with the visuals and audio quality. the band are made up of the very best session musicians and the individual performances were simply \\"class\\". One of the best purchases I have made.    David Fosters influence on music over the past 3 decades is immense and hopefully he will discover even more talent for all to enjoy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|wonderful!  I couldn't put it down.  the characters were smart and very likeable.  There was not a slow moment,  good to the end.
B000RZIGVS|5|This my favoerite series in Star Trek.  I love the fact that I could get the complete set for a reasonable price.  My only complaint is the holder which the discs sit in broke easily.  I am enjoying this series as much now as I did when it originally aired.
B00N35P5MW|4|Gods time killer.
B009CF7JDU|2|It was silly but fun
6305508550|5|One day I was wandering around the local video rental and I saw this on the shelf. I picked it up and noticed the names of Mike Judge and Jennifer Aniston and that have made me rent this movie, I didn't have any other on my mind and I didn't risk much taking this one. And that way I've discovered one of the best comedies since Monty Python's Life of Brian. Great satirical view on today's work and life. I haven't seen such funny American comedy in years, with such a taste of humor (not like American Pie or Scary Movie), without jokes about farting, vommitting and sperm. At last a intelligent film with great dialogs and few worthy observations of American society.
B004L35GAQ|1|The best thing about this CD was the cover art.
B00BVYNSLC|5|The acting in this show is incredible and the character are very interesting. Tatania Maslany does a magnificent job playing multiple characters.
B005ZUR724|5|This is the best mmorpg I've found for kindle.  If your a fan of WoW and want to find something like it for your kindle, get this game.
B009X01C64|4|The standing case was good however did not like the outside elastic strap.  Would have preferred a flap with magnet.
B00F8L2VO4|5|I love the way this starts. You know where you are from the beginning and you can work from there.  Great app for kids
B0054JZC6E|5|its ok, it is a good way to keep occupied when bored. the games are reasonable and fun to play.
B00BAXFECK|5|I liked the character and all his flaws. The author didn't force the main character to be the hero. Just a person figuring out life. The detail of how his life progressed was well developed. ,most stories jump and miss important times in developing a character. This author did a thorough job.
B009HV2JT8|5|I really liked the way that they tried to tie in all of the historical events. It gives the movie a great feel. The special effects were good and the story line was awesome. I would never have pictured Abraham Lincoln as a hero type in this respect. I think that they did an amazing job of retelling the history and events of the Civil War. Even my better half, who is known for picking movies apart, loved this one. :)
B0064TVQ5E|5|I love this app! great game :) no problems with it what so ever. totally addicted. I had never played it before.
B004DLPXAO|5|Love it
B009NY43NY|5|I ate this book up like a delicious dessert.  I have been waiting for the next &#34;Sookie&#34; book and I was thrilled to see this come out.  I tried to take it slow, but that's impossible.  I wanted to know what happened next and I found myself looking for spare minutes to read it whenever I could.  Now I have to wait until the next installment.  I hope it's not too long before I get to satisfy my craving!
B00FHNBDC4|4|His writing and production is so polished sounding. Fantastic next album Mr. Lee!<br />I have been keeping it on repeat for a few days!
B004IK8PLE|5|Great book.  Clear and simple explanations
B009YP9L7U|3|I downloaded this cause it was free and the summary seemed interesting. I liked the story a lot but found parts of it to be a little unbelievable; the dialogue was horrible in parts (no one talks to each other the way these characters did), and I find it hard to believe someone as independent and headstrong as Megan would allow her cousin and her friends to treat her the way they did. Regardless, it was a pretty good story.
B00FKAA3MA|5|Awesome! Great cd Eminem rocks. Sequence of the album is outstanding and it triggers all subjects and purposes. Really satisfied.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|Thanks
1401924352|5|Truly an amazing book. Maybe its not a great peace of \\"literature\\", but its a book that can change your life if you read it carefully and absorb the message she is trying to portray. After reading this I really changed the way I think and live my life. I'm more positive and I really love myself and accept myself. I think thats one of the most important things in life, and if it helped me it could really help you. Glad I bought this, I had been waiting for it to be released for a while.
B00005JMGC|1|This film uses the 50's as a set up for some cheesey hollywood rightous indignation. This film is as if Erin Brockovich travels through time to stop the evil institution of marriage. All men are slimy cheaters and all female students are kissing and touching eachother in a sexual way. Great acting from a great cast is wasted on this cliche' film. Why attack the fifties? Why set a film in the fifties if you hate them as the filmmakers do. Every 50's icon is viewed with a smirky contempt. You have to wonder what the point of making a film that condems the innocence of the 50's is, when we already live in the jaded opposite of the 50's.
0143118420|4|Just days before the Julia Roberts version comes out in theaters nationwide, I finally got around to reading this memoir. I began reading it halfway expecting not to like it (as a few other readers I know didn't care for it), and ended up being pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I do understand why people might not enjoy it though--the book can seem a little self-indulgent and maybe even a tad preachy at times. But for me, Gilbert's easy writing style invited me right in, and through most of the book, I felt more like I was chatting with a dear friend, rather than reading the inner musings of a total stranger. As a travel lover myself, I was thrilled to 'tag along' with Gilbert on her year-long journey to far-away lands (and as a true foodie, I was in heaven during the Italy portion of the memoir...loved sampling the local cuisine vicariously through those pages!). Overall, this was an enjoyable and escapist book that I'm glad I read. I would recommend it to people who are 'armchair travelers' and who like the idea of taking a journey in order to find yourself and find balance in your life. If you don't like the idea of that kind of a journey, then this may not be the book for you.
B00BHHIWQO|5|I love it but it won't come up anymore. Would love to play it again. I so enjoyed diamond dash.
B003O86FMW|4|It begins a little as slowly. There is great detail about what life is truly like in the districts. As the plot picks up. It's hard to put the book down. Well done.!
B009XTF8KQ|5|this was awsome you dont get to much better of a movie, i suggest everyone see this movie! its one of the top possession movies out.
B008Q0DAXK|5|Still as entertaining as it was 30 yrs ago!
B0089LOG02|5|i would suggest this book to anyone tat wants a good read. It is amazing on how these orphans rode these trains and ended up in such horrible living conditions.
B00EHMFC78|3|Will Robie and Jessica Reel make a great team and this book has a lot of action.  However, I felt it was a little too cliche; and not enough of the unexpected.  I knew exactly what would happen well before it did.
B0052UZIFA|3|If this version had the Zen garden I would have given it 5 stars. I hope they come out with an update soon.
1416575464|3|I am a major Domino fan. I have been reading it for two years, living vicariously through its profiles of well-heeled decorators and clients, and the resulting photo shoots. I never used to read decorating magazines because I found them a little stuffy or hilarious, but Domino strikes the right balance between whimsy and realistic. So the book - 4 stars. Why not 5 stars for a 10 star magazine?     The book is, well, a rehash of Domino photos for the past few years. The book is a roundup of decorating elements that have appeared in the magazine - patterns, objects, furniture, objets d'art - and they are presented in a format similar to the Lucky Magazine book on fashion. (Both magazines are published by same company.) The book is high on pictures but low on practical advice. You see pictures, a summary of key elements (as in shapes of furniture, a few keywords about the style). There is some information on how to go about the process of DIY decorating or the professional route, but I really missed the details on where to buy what you saw in a picture, or the personal commentary from people who participated in the decorating that makes the actual magazine so great. I think a major element of Domino's success was to hear how living in a room felt like, and these rooms were beloved because they were very habitable, not at all untouchable or filled with dangerous-looking items (Kelly Wearstler, I'm looking at you). But here you just get the end result, without the process, which is what decorating and creativity are all about.      I would recommend this to people who have NOT ever read Domino, or who don't have the patience for it and would prefer to just look at pictures for ideas on how to fix a room, or to get a sense of what they do like. Faithful Domino subscribers (and the book does include a subscription) might prefer to stick with the back issues. I wish I hadn't been forced to throw mine away due to a move to a smaller place, so this book is a nice resource, but it does not measure up to the real thing.    Some pluses, however, since I would like to end on a positive note for a magazine I've really adored:   - great section on small spaces and how to deal, particularly for renters  - how to put together a not-embarrassing kid's room (!)  - love the hand-drawn illustrations (not found in the real magazine)    Ideally, I'd give it a 3.5/5.
B000FJGWBC|4|We all know that Jessica Alba is hot. And I admit buying this based on the review that the best part was watching her swim in a bikini. But there were only seconds of that, and the movie stands on its own pretty well as the old \\"treasure hunt gone bad\\" story.
B00BLCHZC2|4|Great drama with plenty of action.  I really get invested in the characters and can't wait for the next episode.
B00B2V66VS|3|I like the game but is way way way way way way way way to real life and I still like playing the game but is ok
B00DF0POXA|5|The album is so unique, to be honest one listen won't do it justice. I had to listen to this album about 5 times to understand what I was listening to.  Kanye West realy made something that should be actually listened to, not just skimmed through with 2 or 3 singles.  This album in my opinion is one of my faves its a different take on hip-hop but I'll take it.  I really haven't stopped playing this album along with Born Sinner by J Cole for the past few weeks. Just give it a couple of listens and you'll see what all these 5 star reviews are about.
B001FOPODS|5|I absolutely love this version of Peter and the Wolf. That being said.... I teach elementary school music and cannot use this movie in my classroom. It is far too dark. There are guns and poverty and soldiers, etc. This movie would be wonderful to use in middle or high school to compare/contrast with another version. But it's just not for my elementary school students. As an adult, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of Peter and the Wolf. It has brought new light to the story for me.
B00DR0PDNE|5|The most suitable hardware you can buy for every budget. It works perfectly with any HD TV with an HDMI input. Requires Android or iOS for streaming.
B0002858YS|5|good rock music
B00127RAJY|3|im not really sure how to rate this since it will be a gift for my daughter for christmas gift
006202406X|1|I'm a huge Divergent fan, even giving the book as gifts.  And I was satisfied with Insurgent as well.  Pre-ordered Allegiant and had the release date on my calendar to be sure I'd have time to read it asap.  OMG, what a disappointment.  Allegiant is actually boring!  For most of the book, nothing really happens.  There is not much of a plot line to advance and the characters seem stuck & uninteresting.  Whereas Divergent was full of life, Allegiant felt dead.  I didn't stay up all night to finish it and generally did not care about what little was going on.  It became something I could read a little and then fall asleep.  It's such a shame that this talented author put out this piece of junk.  I'd much rather have waited several more years for a 3rd installment so that she could have taken the time to more fully develop the story and get better editing.
B00AZM7IQC|3|I would like to purchase this item, I only need it in 3D format and think a price of around $27.00 would be more than adequate for it.
B000H2FDTO|1|The number 1 country we import oil from is Canada... but I guess it wouldn't have been as exciting if it was called Ottawana.
B000AADYRQ|5|A much more varied album than their previous (Transatlanticism) DCFC's Plans is a mixture of lighthearted breezy songs(crooked teeth) and ballads (i'll follow you into the dark). I can listen to this entire album without stopping, and thats saying something. Their hit single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" doesn't falter in giving you a musical experience. If you were a little iffy on their last album, but liked their style, I would not hesitate in buying this album. Their styly in music doesnt really change, it's just more enhanced, and their songs dont all seem to last 5 hours like on Transatlanticism. But there are some long moody songs (What Sarah Said) just to show you that they haven't lost their signature style. It's a great album to write and paint to, and I reccommend it to any iffy DCFC fans.
B007PVHMCG|5|great
B00EDLP6O2|5|This game is fun....works great on my kindle. Graphics are cool.<br />Tutorial helps you learn how to play the game.
B00AREIAI8|5|Ok so the graphics are fantastic and its the cheapest way to own your own horse. But its also fairly time consuming.  It takes awhile to level up and a lot of work but as a horse owner  I can honestly say real horses take much more time and care than these ones!
B009C7ZQM4|5|I use this daily.  I like to keep my devices clean of junk and free of unnecessary memory usage.  Seems to keep my battery alive longer also.
B004SJ3BCI|5|I'm addictied to this game!  It's so much fun and can be challenging.  Well worth the $$.  (Oh yeah...it's free!)

B00013PHGS|5|I received this album as a belated Christmas gift a few weeks back. I popped it into the player in my car on a rainy Sunday afternoon while running errands and soon found myself circling the neighborhood absorbing this musical masterpiece. Long ago I lost my Moon Safari CD, and had not listened to Air in quite some time. This CD is original, bold, and eclectic, but it all connects together perfectly. I dare say that I like this better than Moon Safari in many ways. Its a little more &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;experimental&quot; on the outset but after repeated listens the warmth and beauty starts to surface. This and Rufus Wainwright's Want One are two of the best albums of the past 6 months. <br />Highlights for me are Run, Mike Mills (one of the most beautiful instrumentals ever!), Surfing on A Rocket, and Biological. The instrumental from Lost In Translation is wonderful as well. The only weak track on this album is Another Day. I hope I will not have to wait so long for new material from Air next time around as this album shows they have much more sonic territory left to explore.
B006J420UE|5|This is my third APU...........awesome value for the $$$$$
B00CLD65X0|5|Suspenseful and compelling an accurate account of that epic time period when aristocracy was at its pinnacle of transformation / extinction
B00F8802SE|5|Great start to the season!  I love how the show focuses on the day to day struggles and interpersonal relationships to drive the storyline and not just the zombies.  Excellent show and a great start to the season!!!<br /><br />I've been using Amazon prime for the Walking Dead since season 1. It is one of three shows I watch all year. The episodes are typically released several hours after they air on AMC so we are typically just 24 hours behind \\"regular TV\\" viewers.<br /><br /> I highly recommend HD for the extra $1.00. At $2.99 an episode the total cost depends on how many episodes are released. Last year it cost $48 for the season, of course I can still watch all those shows anytime i want so I think it is well worth it.<br /><br /> When you buy the HD shows you get access to the SD ones as well for tablet and phone watching. Even if you can't watch the shows in HD right now, I would still buy that package because you will be able to eventually and like I said you get the SD version too.<br /><br /> I'll adjust the star rating appropriately when the season actually starts. I can't wait for Monday (Oct. 14th) because that's how the past three years have worked with the show on prime! (Side note in the past three years all episodes were released within 24 hours of the airing on AMC except one in season 2 which took almost 3 days, I assume it was technical difficulties)<br /><br />Since I see a few people worrying about the January 1 2014... Last season and season two had similar dates like that and they still released the next day... I am very confident this season will be released on the same schedule as seasons past.
B000003TA4|5|This album exibits some of the best music ever.  Kurt and his band follow in the footsteps of the Beatles and break new music ground in this album.  All post-grunge or post-Nirvana music sounds cheesy compared to the original.  Even in the 21st century, bands are admitting that they were influenced By Nirvana.  This album broke through genre barriers, even people who listen to R&amp;B and rap have heard of Nirvana.  The lead singer may be dead, the band may not be together any more, but the legend lives on.

B00KY7PEAA|1|The only reason that I got this app was cause there was too many adds of it. At first I thought it was a bad game but then I thought it<br />looked a little cool so I got it. Didn't really understand the tutorial. So then something pops up that says I have to be 13 or older to play. Wow. Just wow. So then I say I'm not then it brings me to the Amazon app store then goes to the screen where I installed the app. Amazon plz let me rate 0 star.
B00006FDCD|5|Stephen King has had a lot of movies created from his books. Some he even played a part in. That being said, some have been hits and some have been misses. Lets' not talk about Cujo or Creepshow some of his worst. It on the other hand  is a huge hit. My whole family loved this mini-series/movie. It is shown in two parts the first dealing with a group as children and the second dealing with them as adults. Their is a wonderful symmetry to both parts. ****Spoiler Alert**** The story opens with &#34;IT&#34; taking the life of a ten year old boy, pulling his arm off and pulling him into a sewer. &#34;It&#34; apparently lives in the sewer system. As the movie progresses we learn how the group became a group &#34;The Lucky 7&#34; starting with the brother of the boy who was taken by &#34;IT.&#34; As the group evolves they become stronger taking on the neighborhood bullies and eventually &#34;IT&#34;.  They go from &#34;the losers&#34; as the bullies and they call themselves to &#34;The Lucky 7.&#34; They defeat &#34;IT&#34; as children but, pay a huge price for their victory. In the process the bullies get theirs.<br /><br />****Spoiler Alert *** continued, As adults they all come back to Derry with the exception of one, when they find out that &#34;IT&#34; is back and killing more children. The leader of the bullies is back as well. &#34;IT&#34; puts them through some trials and they pass barely, all leading up to a final confrontation with &#34;IT&#34;.<br />****Spoiler Alert Over*****<br /><br />&#34;IT&#34; is is a great miniseries one in which you will never look at clowns the same way again. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Ralph.
B00005AQGG|5|Easy return
B00FKF0F3C|4|An engaging read, reliving major world events through the characters of Follett, made this very enjoyable. Highly recommended this third book of the trilogy yet I have to say book 1 and 2 were more engaging for me.
B0085P2Z6E|4|Interesting story but VERY wordy.  The HO game is excellent and the variety of other puzzles is very good.  It offers a good combination of of multi-level scenarios at a challenging pace.
B0002OERI0|3|I liked a couple of songs on here but after listening all the way through I kinda regret buying it now. But I still love the band.
B00BB8Q1RQ|4|Enjoyed this movie
B005ZUR724|1|I am very disappointed. When I decided I wanted the Kindle Fire I researched apps and this looked to be the coolest game app and it was. However, I only got around two days to play it before it said needed an update. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling, but nothing worked. So I spent a $1 just to play this game for 2 days to me that is not fair. I really liked this game the days I played it so I hope they fix it (then perhaps it may get 5 stars).

B009UX2YAC|5|I NEVER write reviews but this game is a lot of fun! I am extremely picky and get bored easily, especially with these sorts of games. But this is one that I don't get tired of! I also like the updates and different versions. Download it!
B003VS0CX8|5|This is one of my favorite movies. I don't get tired of watching it.<br />The music is wonderful. Everyone should watch it at least once.
B001V7YWTQ|5|Firstly the production is first rate, and sound beautifully balanced. Just listen to the rhythm section on Dear Mr Fantasy, the bass line is easily discernible without being too prominent. Musically this concert is enough to make a middle aged man like me cry. The musicianship is perfect. Don't listen to the detractors. If you are at all a fan of red hot white blues/soul you will love this.
B008Y7N7JW|5|I just loved seeing this movie after my kids forced me to read the book.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0000025HU|5|London Calling, Who's Next, Allman Brothers - the Fillmore Concerts, Buffalo Springfield Again, Abby Road, Dark Side of the Moon<br />Start there...

B00BOLFRKW|5|Why didn't it get the academy award? It is a cut above all the rest, in a class by itself.
B00CL68NOG|5|I'm one of those people who believe Barbara Streisand has never really gotten her due when it comes to her acting and/or directing skills. I think that is a shame but I love the way she keeps on truckin(old saying!). She never quits & as far as I'm concerned, as well as the friends and family members who love her, she gets better as the yrs go by. This comedy made us laugh out loud because of Ms Streisand & Seth Rogen(omg! He's got the skills).  Loved it!!
B006GLLXXK|4|I was never able to watch True Blood before since I don't take HBO but now watch it on Prime.  I'm enjoying the series a lot, although it is a bit too carnal and I don't think that really helps the plot line much, but other than that, I'm liking it a lot.  Not a good program to watch right before bedtime, though.
B00EGMQIJ0|1|I usually leave books on my kindle after I have finished reading them because I like to go back reread my favorite parts from time to time. Not this one. The paper thin protagonist, the predictable plot, and the extremely heavy handed narrative result it one of the worst books I have ever read.
B008ASLK8A|5|Love the action, lots of excitement, and of course, Robert Downey, Jr. What else can I say? It was great.
B001NLKT60|5|This is the second book in the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larrson. I read the first book and thought it was quite good and I just finished this, the second book. It was even better then the first. I am glad I purchased all three books and started with the first one because I got to know and understand the characters that continued into the second book. I can't praise this book enough. I am about to start reading the third and final installment of the Trilogy and look forward to another terrific read.
B003AO1SVS|4|I really only bought the CD for one song, &#34;Howlin' For You&#34;. There are some other really nice tracks though.
B001NEK2GE|2|Purchased this looking to add space for extra keybinds (using Bartender4) in WoW, while being able to keep all the default keybinds intact.  When you plug it in, it remaps the keys on the unit to copy ones already on the keyboard.  If you just want things compacted..win. But if like me, you were hoping to just be able to keep things in game as they should be, while adding keys just for the things you need, this isn't what you will want to purchase.<br />Since they post this unit as for use with WoW they really should be more specific imo about what it does functionally so more people do not make this mistake.
0316779237|5|...the content can be found in all of his other books, which makes this one more of a &quot;collector's item&quot; for those of us who have read literally every other thing Mr. Sedaris has written. <br />Well, what the heck! It's a cute little book and it's on sale.
6305428220|3|I like most of Robert Rodriguez' work... I just now got around to seeing this one. Not bad, but nothing special. Decent acting, (especially Robert Patrick as your typical [mean] football coach) but some pretty cheesy, TV grade special effects, especially when compared to the films it [copies]. This movie was obviously targeted at teenagers, with each of your stereotypical highschoolers represented. Some of the high school humor and angst was actually entertaining. <br />**SPOILERS**<br />After seeing this, I had to ask myself: is this an homage to or just a [copy] of Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" and \\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\\"? The whole \\"who's really a human\\" and subsequent testing scene are a complete [copy] of \\"The Thing\\", without any of the dread and tension of that masterpiece. Not to mention the crawling head scene, which is a perfect example of why cheap CGI effects are still not as effective as good old fashioned animatronics.<br />I have to give them credit for having the audacity to use crank(homemade speed) as the method of saving mankind, I was laughing and shaking my head in disbelief! <br />******<br />If you are a teenager I'm sure you'll love this movie. But if you want to see a REALLY scary movie, rent John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\".
B004EJ14V2|5|This movie shows how you can turn a frown upside down. It's really just a matter of perspective, everyone! If it's not true who cares what other people think? I've always lived that way and I'm doing just fine. That's why I love this film so much! Lots of lessons to learn about this and that. Nope, not telling!
B00E3UN44W|1|Pretty much the worst season that has been made so far.<br />The shaky-cam will give you whiplash, Sherlock isn't very likable or interesting despite trying to make him more of both for this season, the plots for each episode are pretty boring with very little charm, and Mark Gatiss has WAY too much screen time as Mycroft Holmes (Executive Producer and Co-Creator on the series has too much screen time? No.... Can't be.)<br />Oh, and the big payoff on how Sherlock survived his jump is remarkably unimaginative and doesn't really make sense in a couple of spots.
B00910Y1OQ|5|I really like the graphics in this game and it's got so many pretty ones. It takes some thinking at times but it's very easy to play and time just flies by.

B005UBNKWO|5|I have bought this processor along with a 990fx motherboard chipset, I havn`t overclocked it yet but as a first impression its HUGE, its really big comparing to my old pentium, the strongest point here is the price, its really cheap for a 6 core processor not to mention its unlocked and very overclock friendly, I havn`t played much of games yet but its really fast for multitasking and running cpu intensive programs, thanks to the big cache memory and turbo technology, alot professional reviewers view the fx series of processor as very bad or disappointing, forgeting to focus on the total price and value per speed, even the motherboards are much cheaper than intel and the 990fx chipset is the only chipset that support 2 x16 graphic card at the same time. you might wanna check passmark.com for benchmarking and value per performance.<br />overall its good so far and no issues.<br /><br />edit: most of benchmarks and reviewers are saying the bulldozer series is a failure, and its very slow, the fact is the series is not slow, and on 1080p gaming in comparison its only behind by 6-8 fps from the i5 and the i7 2500k, comparing this to the total price for a motherboard, rams and graphic cards, I would rather waste the money difference on another high end graphic card and run it in crossfire.<br /><br />the point am trying to make is that a merly of less than 10fps in games is not considered a failure giving the performance/value ratio, its a very solid buy.<br /><br />picking up and intel based 2011 79x chipset system and you will end up paying 300 - 400$ more in total, for about 10fps faster in games, thats not really a bargain giving that the 990fx and am3+ is newer and still has a lot of upgradeablity  potential which means it will last you longer since the upcoming piledrive are also am3+ based.<br /><br />please note that this opinion is based from a budget system build point of view, if your serious about building the fastest and strongest gaming reg then simply go with intel 2011 socket and an i7 3930x processor. that will cost you around 2000$ in total compared to amax of 800$ for an amd am3+ build.ith intel 2011 socket and an i7 3930x processor. that will cost you around 2000$ in total compared to amax of 800$ for an amd am3+ build.
0739366416|4|Hearing President Obama read/speak his book is fantastic.  The only slight dissappointment was that it seems that he skips reading some of the parts that talks about individuals or certain kinds of experiences (maybe because they are sensitive if spoken by our now President).  So, I found myself going back to the book to read over those skipped parts.  Still great to hear him talk!!
B0000AQS0F|5|I am a big fan of Buffy/Angel- so my sister got me this DVD because the creator of Buffy (Joss Whedom) also came up with this series.  At first glance, it seems like a sci fi--which isn't really my type of tv show.  But i am glad that i got this DVD- this is not your typical space/sci-fi/futuristic show.<br />  Firefly is set in the future, but unlike other space shows, it has a different feel.  Space is actually quiet and soundless.  The future seems to be dominated by Chinese. There are high tech weapons (lasers and hovercrafts) but also guns, horses and a western feel to some of the episodes.  This is a view of the future that is quite different from most space shows- more grittier, more real, more of a struggle to survive.<br />  The strength of the show comes from the characters and their interactions with each other--they just happen to be on a space ship.  ( i should have known that any show by Joss Whedom would be one of relationships, diaglogue and struggle)<br />  Firefly tells the tale of a rag tag bunch of outcasts who are on a ship (Serenity).  They are lead by their Captain Malcolm and his first mate Zoe (both would be familiar to fans as Caleb from Buffy's last season and Darla's child from angel-i forget her name.)<br />  Joining them are Walsh (zoe's husband), a doctor and his sister, Kaylee (the mechanic) and Jayne (a kind of mercenary).  Also on board is a preacher and Inara \\"a companion\\" prostitute.<br />  Together this group flies around doing odd jobs- some legal, some not.  They are avoiding the alliance (a quasi govenment bad guy), some strange blue handed men and \\"reavers\\" ( sort of space pirates-murderers) as well as their own enemies.<br />  Like all of JW's shows, the human element and relationships are ones that any viewer will be drawn to- the struggle between Walsh and Zoe's marriage (walsh can't believe that he has married such a beatiful and strong woman when he is the opposite):  the deep respect and trust between Zoe and Malcolm:  the budding romance between Kaylee and the doctor:  Inara and Malcolm's tension and attraction:  and all of them has to intereact and deal with River- the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them.<br />  This DVD set contains 14 episodes as well as the usual DVD extras including the making of firefly, Joss Whedom's comments,a gag reel,  deleted scenes etc.  It is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled- but JW himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of Firefly (another series ??a film ??).<br />**also there is a hidden easter egg--jayne singing the folk song about him, on the last disc**<br />  So if you are a fan of good drama, intriguing characters, and witty diaglogue..get this DVD.  I don't know how it got cancelled (bad timeslot? lack of advertising?) but it wasn't because the show wasn't compelling, fascinating and different.the budding romance between Kaylee and the doctor:  Inara and Malcolm's tension and attraction:  and all of them has to intereact and deal with River- the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them.<br />  This DVD set contains 14 episodes as well as the usual DVD extras including the making of firefly, Joss Whedom's comments,a gag reel,  deleted scenes etc.  It is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled- but JW himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of Firefly (another series ??a film ??).<BR>**also there is a hidden easter egg--jayne singing the folk song about him, on the last disc**<br />  So if you are a fan of good drama, intriguing characters, and witty diaglogue..get this DVD.

B0000009SF|5|I can't think about this album without remembering the intermission while watching the tour.  Needing bodily relief, I braved the men's room and when I finally got my chance at the stall, moaned: &quot;Blessed Relief&quot; (one of the album's song titles).  Immediately, the fellow standing next to me exclaimed: &quot;Eat that Question!&quot; (another song title from the album) and the whole place erupted in laughter.  Frank may not have had the largest following, but we were serious fans and we still are.<br />This disc is amazing from many viewpoints.  It was a step further into fusion for the band, maybe we should call it fusion with a sense of humor.  Read the liner notes for clues.  Considering when it was recorded, the sound quality is excellent.  The entire album is fluid from front to back so it's hard to pick favorite tracks but I guess Cletus Awreetus Awrightus and the title track are my favorite two.  This is a great disc to listen to late at night, with the lights low or out.  The percussion floats in space, as do the horns.  I can still get lost in the cymbals and the overall ambience.  It's biggest fault is that it was too short but at the time, Frank kept his LP sides short in order to improve dynamics and reduce crosstalk on vinyl.  Too bad he didn't extend this to a 2-LP set.<br />Essential stuff, don't miss it.
B00H7MW31S|5|Lea is so amazing,<br />she just finished her album&book,and in procces of creating more..<br />this album is intense and shows up her beautiful(!) voice so well,<br />every song is so special and different,<br />for people who loves meaningful soul fun songs-this is the album for you.
B00A6CCF0K|5|I love that king can continue a story after so many years. Always wonder what happens to the characters after the story ends. He should do this with more of his book.
B002MW50KO|5|This album is so so so so good! Great in the earphones, great as background music. Listened to it three times straight through on 1st December (can't do Xmas tracks before December), and I think it will become a treasured lifelong friend. Dylan is effortlessly cool and he has (effortlessly it would seem) produced this non-sickly, non-cheesy masterpiece just to make you smile this Christmas...happy listening!
B000007XUQ|2|I'm not really a Carpenter's fan, but there were two songs I wanted for variety around Christmastime, and they are both on this CD.
B0087240Z4|5|Sounds like the old Pumpkins from the '90's.  If you like that, you'll love this.  Album really flows and is worth a listen and another, and another, and another...
B0043URV8M|5|As good as the book are written, so is the music for this soundtrack. It sets the moods all perfectly for each and every background, conversation, battle, silly times, dark times, hopeful & hopeless times. The composer (Alexandre Desplat) has the opportunity to really follow in the foot steps (and possibly overcome) the greats before him (Hans Zimmer, Ennio Morricone, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore, John Williams), and he had a lot to prove taking on the daunting task of composing music for such a Magical and Visually overwhelming story. He did spectacularly.

B005DKLPF6|3|I am a strong fan of Mastodon's recorded music. I say recorded, because unlike one of the reviewers, I feel it's Mastodon's usual gravelly raspy vocals that none of them can actually pull off unless they're in a studio with special effects and not playing instruments at the same time. Brann is possibly the exception, usually singing clean, but how often does he get to sing? Come to think of it, Mastodon needing to tour supporting an album with songs they can actually sing in concert would explain a lot about The Hunter, though not everything.  Anyway, I am a strong fan of Mastodon albums (and the EP). I would rate Leviathan five stars because the songs are well composed and because it was revolutionary at the time. No one had ever sounded like that before, including Mastodon. Blood Mountain gets four stars from me. Pretty good album--basically in the vein of Leviathan, but not quite as good and obviously not as revolutionary. Crack the Skye also gets five stars. I can understand the Mastodon fans who were disappointed by Crack the Skye because it was not as heavy and for other reasons. I for one liked the songs (most of them). The album had seriousness (Why does Skye have an E), the songs were thematically connected, and it was musically original (though some will disagree). I believe it is a masterpiece and deserved a Grammy nomination (if it got one, and I somehow missed it, somebody let me know).   Now, we come to The Hunter. This can't be five stars. It lacks the originality and brilliance of Leviathan or the coherence and novelty of Crack the Skye. It can't be a one star either. That would mean, to me, that most of the songs are unlistenable. Closing in from the top again, it's no four either. That would mean it's another Blood Mountain. I can't think of a single track on The Hunter as good as Sleeping Giant. Hunters of the Sky, or Siberian Divide, although \\"The Hunter\\" (track) seems to be hearkening back in that direction a little. Two stars? As I'm listening,it just doesn't have the irritation factor I expect from two stars. Even Curl of the Burl, which has an irritating name, I couldn't bring myself to fast forward through (and least the second or third time--after that, who knows). The one exception is Creature Lives, which makes me want to shoot myself, and not in a good way (it's Yes, whose early work I love, after they decided to stink). On the other hand, there are some songs, like The Sparrow, that I was surprised to find out I like.  So, that leaves me at three stars.  This is never going to be a classic Mastodon album. It's just not original enough. Most of the tracks sound like simplified--can I say it?--HAPPIER sounding versions of older Mastodon. An exception is Curl of the Burl, of course, which sounds like Govt. Mule with metal fuzz. Mule fans who like metal, I wonder if that track hits the spot? I imagine it will be one of those albums that people buy in one of two ways. 1. You are a die hard Mastodon fan and you will buy anything they put out. Some of you apparently love this album. Fine. Either way, you bought it. Or, 2. This is the first, or one of the first Mastodon albums, you ever bought. If you even sort of like The Hunter, you may be in for a treat, going back to discover Crack the Skye and possibly Leviathan (though you might not have the stomach for the vocals in early Masto right away).  If you're in camp #1, you may listen to The Hunter a few more times because you have worn out the tracks in your LP or CD or MP3s of the earlier ones. Familiarity may make some of the tracks sound better with time. Maybe some worse. There is value in this album. It's not a beer coaster. Unless I'm stunningly mistaken, it's not a future retroactive masterpiece either. Three. Stars.

B000002KAT|5|Just what I wanted.
B000ZLFALI|3|\\"Across the Universe\\" is a musical with Beatles songs. But do we really need another Beatle musical (after \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\") when we already have \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" \\"Help!\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Let it Be\\"? How about fabulous \\"Yellow Submarine\\"? But of course, I may be wrong. After all, it's the Beatles and you can't go wrong with their great songs, but as far as \\"Across the Universe\\" is concerned, I am not still sure.     You either love or hate \\"Across the Universe\\" which is directed by Julie Taymor. Her works as film director include \\"Titus\\" and \\"Frida\\" and if you have seen her previous works, which some viewers call creative while others, well, pretentious, you know that storytelling is not her forte.     Because so many reviewers have already summarized the plot (or the lack of it) I will not go into the details of it. In short, a young man from Liverpool Jude (Jim Sturgess) meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) in America and they fall in love with each other. The time is set in the 1960s, politically and socially turbulent years.    So far, it is good. But the romance of Jude and Lucy needs a better story. Their story is clichéd, disjointed, and their romance is uninvolving. Moreover, \\"Across the Universe\\" runs more than 130 minutes, which is 40 minutes too long.    But you might say it is a musical and it is music that matters. Unfortunately our Jude is no Paul and his singing is just passable. Besides, it seems some songs are randomly chosen, which do not fit in the story. Visually intriguing as it is, for example, the musical sequence featuring John Lennon's \\"I Want You\\" sequence is rather pointless, with one bizarre idea of \\"She's So Heavy.\\"     Also, many references to the Beatles songs and the group member's background (Jude's father, for instance) are thrown in. They are mildly amusing at first, but soon start to look shallow, even silly. You remember the song \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window.\\" Yes, she really does.    Some musical scenes are really brilliant (\\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" in a bowling ally scene and Joe Cocker's \\"Come Together\\" with a nice choreography). But as I said, you can't go wrong with the Beatles songs.

0385336810|5|Okay, Emma is slightly dopey with all her little secrets, but haven't we all at one time or another left the scene of the copy room when the paper got jammed? Believing she'll never lay eyes on the handsome stranger who sits beside her on a turbulent flight, Emma reveals her innermost secrets and most fatal character flaws. The fun begins when the stranger turns up on her job. He's the CEO! Be prepared to laugh uproariously.
B008V59AF2|2|As everyone agrees, this is one of the best albums ever recorded, and this new edit is very clean, crisp and accurate.  It is also very hot.  One review put several different mixes of this on a scope, and only this one pegged out at 100 percent on peak amplitude.  If you are using this mix for a car stereo, or if you employ less than full-range audio reproduction, this will no doubt sound much better than the old cd.  If you are pushing more air, you will need a little de-attenuating to enjoy it.  Levin's masterful bass playing on this mix is too pronounced at higher volume ranges, even at moderate volumes.  This recording was originally heavy on the low end, and when these engineers cranked this up, they should have turned the low end down on the final mix. I just compared the end bass run on 'Don't give up' to the old CD release, and I have to tell you, the old edit was more listenable, especially at higher volumes.  The new one was almost unlistenable, way to heavy on the bass. So the two stars are for this edit, certainly not the music, which is among the best.

B00QI1N0KW|5|Her best album thus far.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|From the beginning this story latched onto my heart and refused to let go. Emotions, feelings, connections, reactions, etc were written in a way that made you the reader 'feel' everything that was happening. While there were times I felt I couldn't read/deal with what was happening, I pushed myself on a 'felt' every heart wrenching moment.  I'm not sure if I'll read the next book. I think for me the story ended the way it should have and I'm content with that. I don't want to ruin that feeling.
031606792X|5|I'm not sure why some readers are using such harsh language to review this book.  After all, this is a fiction story, purpose:  entertaining.  I love surprising, romantic, unthinkable, and happy ending story so if you are too, you will like this book.  If you are thinking too much, breaking down too much, and love dramatic ending, this book is not for you.  Have fun to decide!
076790592X|5|it is really amazing!As a teen, reading this kind of self-help book is beneficial. This bk was actually recommended by my friend. After reading, I really appreciate and wanna give her a BIG THANKS!!<BR>I especially love the chapters about death and money. Very good interpretation and inspiring. I immediately lent my bk to my other friends. n' they love it too.<BR>I highly recommend this Bk* :]

B002361MLA|5|Eckhart has popped up quite a bit along my path. He continues to come into my space. Read this book, do not become attached to the words, and experience the knowing yourself. Believe no more, simply know.
B001G9LVGG|4|I really only like a couple songs on this CD.  It is not her best work by any means, but if you like her music, it is worth a try.  (I'd listen to various cuts first for free to see if  you really want it.)
B009JBZH54|3|I wanted The Dark Knight Trilogy and that's what it is, but it's no more than all all the films together in a pack. I already owned the second movie, and is absolutely the same same than in this package. Its good, yes, but it's not great, nothing new.<br /><br />You have all you can need, the movies and a lot of different extra content, but... I was expecting more.<br /><br />One more thing, the Spanish is Latino Spanish, not from Spain.
B00AREIAI8|5|this is a great game. the only thing I didn't like was that you can not just ride the horse. All in all a great game

B004VMUS9G|5|I am fortunate to have no need for an alarm clock, but I use this on my Kindle Fire all the time. I set it to remind me of conference calls and appts as I often get caught up in what I am doing and forget to look at the clock. Initially, my biggest disappointment was that I could only set the alarm on the day of the event, but I discovered that if I used the repeat setting I could set alarms up to a week in advance. AWESOME! The only thing that would make it more perfect is if it had a calendar...oops, I keep forgetting it's 'only' an alarm clock.
B000HKW7E0|5|Love this movie! Watch it every year! Super funny and entertaining!! Love Chevy Chase, he's a great actor and very funny!
B000006P8I|3|This is a weird album with some really embarrassing, albeit charming, moments. \\"There is a Happy Land\\"??? Whoa-- this is the same man would become the most cynical person in 1974-75? It reminds me of Marianne Faithfull; 60s folkies who were all love and peace, as was the time, and then got so disillusioned later on (I guess like the rest of society, post-Manson & Altamont)that they just radiated bitterness and cynicism.<br /><br />He is just straight-up goofy here. I think he was about 19 or so when he recorded it. He shows promise, and of course we know what a genius he became, but he seems a bit like Paul McCartney-- a supremely gifted person who really needs to be surrounded by the right people to check his daffier tendencies.<br /><br />The Laughing Gnome is one example of some kind of Syd Barret influence gone wrong. Terribly wrong. But it is amusing; I remember when I was an adolescent Bowie Worshipper, this one horrified me. I was so embarrassed for him. But now it's pretty funny. Post script: I see the Laughing Gnome is not on this release. It must be another re-release I'm thinking of. But if you are curious about Bowie's true youthful weirdness, check it out!
0060245867|5|Simply put, this is a wonderful book.  Our 19 month old daughter has enjoyed this book since she received it on her first birthday.  The story is simple and easy to follow and the pictures are big and bright and wonderfully drawn.  There aren't alot of words on every page so if you have a younger child that likes to turn the pages frequently, this makes it easy to keep the story going. Although the story is whimsical and involved enough for an older child to enjoy as well.  We have read this book so many times that my daughter has memorized some of the words on every page and pretends to &quot;read&quot; it herself.  Personally, I feel this is the best of the &quot;If you give a .....&quot; book series (we have them all).  I think the only improvement this book could use is if it came in a board book version as the paper pages in our hardback version are quickly becoming worn from all the frequent reading and toting around!  A true classic that I feel any parent with a young child can't go wrong with.
0307949508|4|Have read the books years ago and just bought them as a gift.  This is a great reading for amusement
B00M25DDQE|5|Now that my TV’s are High Definition I rarely buy DVDs. Whenever there is a DVD I want to see I’ll either rent it or wait until it’s on Cable. After watching Lucy I had to buy it. This is not the typical Luc Besson Action Film; this film has an interesting message also. Throughout the movie there are references to cells, cells as the building block of matter, individuals as a cell, family units as a cell, the human species as a cell and this Gaia-Sphere we inhabit as a cell. Our modern Industrial society also has characteristics of a cell, a Metastasizing Carcinoma. The movie talks about time giving legitimacy to existence, I’ve always wondered, if time is infinite, the fact that we exist no matter what the probability of it happening, then we’ve had this dance many times in the past and will have this dance again in the future, this might be why Lucy says we never really die. The central theme of the movie is what happens as Lucy gains more control of her Cerebrum capacity, this is a common Sci-Fi theme. Considering the energy required to have our Brain function at 10% it’s hard to imagine we’ll ever be able to control more than this, 25% of our basal metabolism goes to the Brain. The question we need to be asking is, does our high Carbohydrate, high Sugar and low Fat Western diets provide enough energy for our Brains to function properly. The foods we eat seem to promote Fat storage not metabolism, is it possible the majority of people in the West have Brains that are undernourished. Maybe a population who’s thinking and reasoning abilities are diminished is desirable, maybe this type of population is easy to manipulate and control.  Lucy tells a group of scientists that we have codified our existence to bring it down to human size to make it comprehensible; we’ve created a scale for it so that we can forget its unfathomable scale. The Deities we’ve created to define what we are, the Abstractions we possess that give our life value; as a species we’ve become more concerned with having than being. Over the last Billion years conditions have existed that has allowed this Gaia-Sphere to nurture a wide range of varied, beautiful and interconnected expressions of life, humans are just one of these expressions. Lucy says it best “What are we going to do with this Gift”.
B007J4T2G8|5|This is a great book..  wish now I would have just ordered the trilogy.  As soon as I finish my other books I will order the next two.  Thanks
B0016YBFZ8|5|This is one of the best movies ever! Every actor is fantastic and there are just too many to name !

B002HK9IDQ|3|Most of the players performed as expected. The Story line was Ok. I did not like Rex Harrisons performance.  Most of his Dialog was not actual singing, And his performance was not well executed. I believe That there are more modern renditions that have better performances.<br /><br />  G E J
B00005JHAB|5|I loved this movie, I thought this was the perfect movie for romance and also comedy. This movie is the most perfect girly movie.
B004S3X9ZS|4|Although I don't love this sound as much as I was promised I would, I do think this is a quality music product.
B008MM9630|5|Very fun. Wish they would give more crystals and not keep jumping the amount for more land. But very easy to use.
B0069G5Z9K|5|Hi I am jayme. I like jetpack joyride I think this game is so awsom that I want to merrie it.
B00CLD671A|5|My criticisms are only about the story line & Shirley MacLaine's character.  Regarding the story line:  There were many other characters that could have &#34;passed on&#34; without doing away with a favorite.  It seems that bringing in new characters is what the writer seems to focus on.  Personally, I could care less about most of the new characters & miss my favorite.<br /><br />As an American, I do take offense with the rude, common, flashy nouveau riche, vulgarity person that the writer seems to want classified as how those fortunate in times of need behaved in the USA.  All of the wealthy non-American characters have an elegance about them.  Even Tom after he has become used to being included.  Shirley MacLaine is a fantastic actor.  To have her &#34;over act&#34; and portray Cara's mother as the writer/director has done is an insult.
B0095MVOMC|1|won't run on original kindle fire ... displays half the screen and won't allow access to home or back buttons to quit, have to hard reset to get rid of it.
B00AREIAI8|5|It is a very good game I love it I've had it for a long time. It is so fun you have to pet feed and ride the horse and you can enter it in races. It is a fun game it is good for all ages.
B005LAIGPU|5|Found this movie for a great price and when it came I was excited to use it. It did not disappoint.
0767812387|5|THIS IS ONE OF VANESSA WILLIAMS BEST DANCE MOVIES THAT SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER, NICE MOVIE TO WATCH ON SUNDAYS WITH YOUR FAMILY
B000000WA4|5|This is one of the greatest rock alblums ever crafted. From the metal guitar riffs of Zero to the techno rock of 1979 to the string laden Tonight Tonight the Smashing Pumpkins have produced a masterpiece with MCIS. There  is no filler here, all two hours of music are well written and recored.  Billy Corgan is a fine song writer and his skill is apparent on Mellon  Collie. If you are looking for a wonderful collection of music, buy this  CD, it is worth the money.
B00HBQWGXK|1|One of Jack Reacher's worst story lines. Lee Child, you can do much better and have. I feel like Mr. Child just phoned this plot in.
B007JMW46U|5|Sherlock Holmes is simply amazing.  The stories are engaging and entertaining without a lot violence and vulgarity.
B00L9B7IKE|1|Sorely disappointed and difficult to follow especially on a device - had a hard time figuring out who was who and who belonged to who - finally had to write down a flow chart so I didn't have to flip around in my Kindle. And Rachel - honestly, she was ridiculous ---are there people really and truly that stupid? I know there are people who are stuck and cannot make a good decisions for various reasons, but Rachel takes the cake. Not worth reading. Sorry I wasted time on this book.
B0057ZAA6W|5|This movie is one of the best movies ever made..  you have to see it to understand how brilliant it is.  Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlye, Kevin McKidd are outstanding in this film.... remember to choose life.. :))))
B004EPYZUS|5|We love this movie and it is a great addition to our movie library which we have hundreds. I guess if I have an addiction it is movies. Thank you.
B005NS5CX4|5|I purchased Own The Night, when Amazon offered it for .25. Not only was it a fantastic deal, but I have enjoyed every song on the album.
B00T4837W2|5|loved it, was new way of showing story.
B00CL68QVQ|2|This is just the same old story (boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl) with the &#34;quirky&#34; addition that both girl and boy are crazy.  I do not understand why what's-her-name got the Oscar...she just chewed the scenery and yelled a lot.  I think she was much bette -n &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;  (see that one!).  A one-trick-pony movie that got the buzz because it was not a franchise (like Superman, Fast and Furious, etc.); not too many &#34;one off&#34; movies these days so the critics went overboard.  So it goes.
B00005Y6YB|5|Superb TV series in the day and absolutely great to be able to revisit it in full.  A timeless classic!
B00QLVY7J2|5|I LOVE this game!!!
B0063IH60K|3|It's ok but the game doesn't last long as its hard to get cards up. I prefer the games that require a little  more thinking.
B000002H33|5|Awesome album. Master and Battery kicks hard. And I love the metal play of Orion. My favorite is Sanitarium. This is a must have for any Metallica fan; oh though, I must disagree with a lot of people here. I think  Metallica has been doing their best since this album. They had made great  albums then, and they are still making them good. I don't care what anyone  says. Sure they have a different sound now, but it's still great. If every  album sounded the same, then they would be boring. Anything Metallica sings  is great. They are great even when they suck. Get all the albums if you are  a true Metallica fan.
B0030V0PEW|5|This is an eye opening book for anyone who works in medicine, and an empowering book for patients.  Dr Gawande provides an accurate look at the safety culture of medicine and illuminates ways that we can improve.  This will be required reading for my housestaff.
B00CQGU9GG|5|I was introduced to ZZ Top by Eliminator in the 80s.  As I grew older I kept hearing about the \\"70s\\" ZZ Top and started downloading individual songs as my interest for classic rock grew. Today I have 22 songs from the 70s era and once I saw this Complete Studio Albums I figured it was time to download a few more.  Then I started reading about people's excitement for the original mixes and I went to youtube to do some research.  I couldn't believe the difference between the remixes and the original recordings.  I checked out most of the songs I originally downloaded only to find the most of them are the remix variety.<br /><br />To see for yourself, just go to youtube and search \\"ZZ Top Beer Drinkers\\" and you will find two videos that show the green album cover.  The remix will not be called remix, just ZZ Top - Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers, and the good version is the one that says \\"Original 1973 Vinyl Mix\\".  Just listen to the first 10 seconds of both and you will hear an incredible difference.<br /><br />Part of me is angry as I feel that I've been listening to the wrong songs all these years.  But now I just ordered this box set on CD which I will be receiving this week and feel like I will be hearing ZZ Top for the first time!!  Love the sound of the preview clips and can't wait to hear what all the original fans already know.<br /><br />Update: I received the box set earlier this week and am so happy that I pulled the trigger on this one!  The songs sound so crisp and clear especially through the Bose speakers in my car. You can actually feel the guitar solos.  I have browsed all the albums and found so many incredible songs that I had never heard before like: Goin' Down to Mexico, Mushmouth Shoutin', Chevrolet, Bar-B-Q, Nasty Dogs And Funky Kings, Avalon Hideaway, and Asleep In The Desert just to name a few.  For $40 this really is a no-brainer.
B000PFU7OO|5|This is our 5th season. My husband and children loved it. The product came in time and perfect condition
B005ZOBNOI|5|I could not put this book down.. A must read for people who are struggling with illness and death..Read it.
B00I8Q77Y0|1|Sucks, to easy to lose, crappy game mechanics, and why do you fall farther than you fly when you flap at a constant rate?
B00AYB0TOW|4|This is a pure and unadulterated action flick. It goes back and forth between fast paced action and bullet-time sequences that show, in a strangely beautiful and artistic fashion, body parts being blown apart and bullets ripping through flesh and brain. The amount of detail that is present in these slowed down shots is pretty amazing but also kind of disturbing. Definitely worth seeing in HD.
B000000YNZ|4|I own many Bill Evans CD's, including every one he did before this.  Bill set out to be lyrical on this all-ballad record.  The best way to understand the result to describe what it is not.  It is nothing like the rowdy cuts on New Jazz Conceptions and Everybody Digs Bill Evans - no up tempo numbers.  Paul Motian really eases up here.  No dancing on a tight rope like Portrait.  So then, how does it compare to the more subdued Village Vanguard recordings and Explorations?  Sadly, to me, it does not hold up there either, and it's not just the loss of Scott LaFaro (later recordings prove that).  Those CD's have a sophistication and subtle drama that draw the listener in; this recording seems ordinary by comparison.  Perhaps that was inevitable - Evans had already tamed the frontiers of innovative voicings, modal music, rhythmic displacement and three-way simultaneous improvisation and was said to hate recording because he did not have much new to say.  This was his first all-out attempt to pull the heartstrings.  It's still Bill Evans, and he's still great, but the gunslinger checked his best guns at the door here.  The result comes across as mainstream, with nothing daring or edgy going one.  Of course, mainstream pays the bills - this was one of his most popular CD's.  However, I reach for it to deal with road rage, not when I want to hear Bill Evans at his finest.
0525951652|3|Please stop the price-based reviews!  This is not the venue.  I almost decided I had no interest in reading it based on the overall review score being so low.  I'm glad I went ahead and actually read the reviews. The only really negative ones (1-star) are based solely on it \\"costing too much\\" and there are a LOT of them.  Cost has nothing at all to do with the merits of the book! I will definitely be reading it. I gave it 3 stars because I haven't actually read it yet, and that seemed like splitting the difference.
0064431789|5|A relative bought this book for my children, almost 50 years ago. At first I thought &#34;this will scare them&#34; so I put it aside till they were a little older. Once we read it, it became an every night favorite, along with another book of their choice. They took turns choosing and it was always the Wild Things and one other. I now have a great, great niece about to be born and I am going to purchase this book for her, although it will be some time before she will understand. I also came upon another copy at a yard sale and also purchased it.<br />Now we have 2 copies and each of my sons have one for their children. I took my grandchildren to see the movie too.
B0036EH3WK|5|i know this is a pre-review, but, barring some glaring technical glitch, this will be a truly great set.  LOST is a show unlike any other in the history of the medium.  not only is it a great show, with inspired acting, inspiring music, gorgeous photography, and trippy storylines...  not only does it have deep characterizations and an even deeper mythology...  not only is it cinematic in scope yet intimate in the smallest character moments...  not only is it, like, totally addicting.  it's also the first time (at least here in the u.s.) that a t.v. series has a complete beginning, middle and end, just as the creators intended it.    so many shows start out brilliantly, chug along for a while on that inspiration, then start to peter out somewhere along the way and then... stop (twin peaks).  or, are episodic in nature and don't have the burden of having to *end* properly.  but LOST started off with a bang, settled in with the characters and their predicament, started to repeat itself *just* a bit, then decided that it needed to end at a certain point and started it's long steady march toward it's denouement.  and it's been nothing but greatness ever since.    it's often said that movies are like short stories, and t.v. is more like a novel.    well, we have our first truly great novel.

B000063DIH|4|This album is divided into three parts:    The standouts: Be Quick or Be Dead, Childhood's End and Fear of the Dark  The good: From Here to Eternity, Judas Be My guide, Afraid to shoot strangers  The other tracks are ok.    My favourite track on the record is Childhood's End, which is all about war (a typical theme for metal). It's sort of like a ballad, even the instruments sound emotional.     And finally, here is the score for each track individually:  Be Quick or Be Dead: 9/10  From here to Eternity: 8/10  Afraid to Shoot Strangers: 8/10  Fear is the Key: 6/10  Childhood's End: 11/10  Wasting Love: 7/10  The Fugitive: 5/10  Chains of Misery: 4/10  The Apparition: 5/10  Judas Be My guide: 8.5/10  Weekend Warrior: 5/10  Fear oof the Dark: 10/10    Standout track: Childhood's End (why couldn't this have been performed live)
B0012GTZC0|5|Excellent story flashing back and forth between main characters, slowly building tension and then climaxing toward the end of the book with an unexpected turn. Author did an excellent job setting up the resolution to the underlying theme, weaving many details of what may have been going on in both Churchill's and Hitler's camps. Excellent! Dialogue was very believable as well as story line. Will be reading more of his books!
B00MASEPTC|5|Simply epic

B001F6TXME|5|great for night time photography. the wireless one was not so great.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Loved it!  Couldn't stop reading it.  I especially liked that it was a continuance of another of Grisham's books.  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B006885LZM|5|Very clear what our greatest generation went through over there in the Pacific.  It clearly shows the bravery and the iinsanity of war.  I would love to see the story of Vietnam by the same directors.

B0038YWPZS|5|I bought this Keepsake Edition of Dirty Dancing for my daughter, who's a massive fan.  It didn't disappoint.  Packaging is excellent and the book that's included is a real gem.

B00DC3DGSK|5|There is no other artist at this age that has the energy of Buddy Guy. He has found the fountain of youth. His voice sounds great and NOBODY can play the guitar with such a FORCE as Buddy Guy. When he goes into one of his patented guitar solos I just crank up the volume. He continues to amaze. Have seen Buddy live many times and just saw him a couple weeks ago. Still going strong. Love this album and a double album is a special treat. Buddy Guy is one of a kind. A true gem of an artist.
B00466HN86|5|The movie was inspiring, eye opening, educational, beautiful, motivational as well as entertaining.  I cannot think of a better way to spend some down time.  Actually, I was exhausted after seeing the movie because it aroused so many emotions. It is a walk in everyday life, with everyday people and challenges.  I cannot think of a better gift to give to someone you love.  My hats off to the makers of this fine movie.
B00C8USQEM|5|This is one of my favorite TV shows. Now I can watch it without commercials any time I want. The HD quality is 1080p and very sharp on my 47&#34; LG TV. It arrived as promised in 2 days. Thanks for the listing.
B008133MDK|5|Makes all other Sherlock Holmes production look second rate. Writing and production quality unmatched by any current TV or movie version.
B0010SKSTO|5|I loved this book! Mr. Navarro made this book hard to put down and it is practical throughout the read. I gleaned so much out of this book that at times it was hard to remember when I went to practice finding \\"tells.\\" It is interesting from time to time to see some of these \\"tells\\" such as the framing with thumbs in the belt loop! I really didn't expect to change my own body language by reading this book but I found some bad habits that I fell into as far as body language and realize how others perceive me based on that. Anyway, I would recommend this book to anyone!
B007N85ZXY|5|Great renditions of Americana classics. I don't know if &#34;Get A Job&#34; is an Ameicana classic but what the heck. It's the Niel Young we love.
B00GNK18X4|5|One direction is amazing, ive listened to this record from and back and I love every song. Totally worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I never write reviews, but I loved this book. Couldn't put it down until I finished it. I lost a lot of sleep but worth it.
B001BANK32|5|As always, great story- I've had this book for 30 years and I loaned it out. I bought it for $1.99 as part of a monthly deal, and it was great re-reading it, and on a Kindle Fire at that. Something new for an old book.
B003UBTX6S|4|I thought this was a fun read and a page turner.  Can't wait too read the next book.  Wonder what will happen next.
B003YL4LYI|3|I liked this book but it was boring for most of it until the end. The last 2 books of this series have been this way. I do hope the next is much better.
6303187064|5|this is one of the best movies in the world to me and it has a great  story. I like it because it has something for everybody action, love story,  and the coolest special effects i have ever seen, this movie should be seen  by everyone and I know for a fact that you will enjoy it.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Love this!
B005V2EVBQ|1|Dont waste your money on this product.  I tryied to use the cover as a stand and its useless.  It will not secure in place to hold position as a stand.  Wish I could send it back! Complete waste of money.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|You s should by the game pixel gun rocks I a m so addicted to it I can not get off the game pixel gun!!!!!!!!!!$$$$$$$$$$:)
B000OCXMAE|5|I was completely astounded from start to finish! At first listen the radio friendly cuts grab you: Leave Out All The Rest, Shadow Of The Day..and while these are supreme LP cuts its the edgier stuff that really takes the cake: Given Up, Hands Held High, Valentine's Day is classic LP and would've fit in place on any LP album. Theres inspiration, innovation, and versatility everything you love about LP is alive and well and dare I say...better. The album is perfect start to finish, nuff said so stop hatin and download: Given Up, No More Sorrow
B000FC2L1E|5|Diana Gabaldon has created a very plausible tale of love and heart break.  She has really done her research and brings the 18th century to life.  Her characters make us root for some and hate others.  Jamie and Claire's love story is one we all would wish we experienced.
1608193381|4|I was looking for an articulate depiction of the deep flaws of capitalism --- one that would convince some people that we need balance in our world system.  What I found was a very articulate work showing the imperfections of capitalism.  Perhaps there are no deep flaws in relation to alternative economic systems, but only in relation to competing religious and moral systems.<br />This book will appeal to people with above average intelligence and above average capacity for sympathy.  That describes most progressives (the few other progressives being selfish opportunists).<br />The author is very sharp and very honest.  This is a good read but will not change the world.
B00008PX8P|5|I found myself yelling and screaming with the crowd as if actually at a concert-video and audio is THAT good.  As we know some live Zep performances on bootlegs are not the best--THESE ARE.  Truly illustrates the magic of a Zeppelin concert.  I cant overstate how good this set is.  And for the price?  WOW!  I am at a loss for words. My title says it best: UN BELIEVABLE!
081297381X|4|dense, difficult reading but well worth the time involved to learn the insights of this very bright man...it may change your life and certainly will change the way you look at the daily financial page.
B000BKVQTS|4|This is probably Guilliam's most normal film ever.  That doesn't mean that it is entirely conventional, it's just more conventional than Time Bandits, Brazil or Baron Munchousen. <br /> <br />As I am a fan of Guilliam, I went to see this one in the theatre.  What I had to say about it was- not so good as I expected, but still a good film.  If you're expecting the film to top Guilliam's earlier masterpieces, you'll be disappointed.  If you give the film a more fair viewing, then you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit. <br /> <br />Like Guilliam's other works, the story is kept to a minimum while our attention is drawn to the brilliant imagery.  A little less episodic than Time Bandits or Baron Munchousen- a little more normal on that account. <br /> <br />The tale keeps up a fairly lighthearted tone most of the time, except that the imagery is consistantly dark, and sometimes violent.  So, you ought not to watch this film unless you like a bit (but not a lot) of blood. <br /> <br />Y'know, I'm thinking that this is such a dark comedy, and most people can't stand a little light-hearted torture thrown in for good measure.
B00J8NDGOM|3|This game needs you to search for string fast.<br />It's more suitable on a phone when riding bus. The UI isn't designed for tablet.
B00QW8TYWO|5|NUFF SAID love it!!
B007ZTLLMK|4|It was fun for a while but the gyro is a little too sensitive and it really has no point to the missions. Fun if you have nothing else to do except drive in a car. I like the game but would like to have a real RC Helicopter instead. Realistic but it looses its flavor after 10 minutes. Can't knock the price though cause it was free. Would not spend any money on it...
B00BATG18K|3|more details about sex in a whore  house than I care to know  confusing jump between the tales of the generations  a long story  sad  did not really like this book
B005MLOKXA|4|The plots started getting more involved and hard to follow.  That is why I didn't give it a five star
B00HV2KPNW|5|My boys and childcare love this movie!  I've seen this, already, multiple times.  I'd watch it over and over again.
B00DUGCLY4|5|its fun app... some of the don't make scence at first but you get them eventually. has stuff to work on
B00D8CSVLW|5|From the first page you turn you know that it is going to be a story you will remember.  Predictably brilliant Grisham with gripping back-stories, no frustrating loose ends to ponder at the finish and an outcome that no-one could guess.
