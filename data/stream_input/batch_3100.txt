B0070Y46UY|5.0|Nothing! Stop reading this review, buy this book and start reading it. You will be happy you did! It is every bit as outstanding as you've heard.
B00BEIYH1A|5.0|I went the movies to see Kick-Ass 2 because I really liked the first one.  I was and am happy to say that in my personal opinion that this was just as fun and entertaining. Of course movies like this one will always get critical reviews regardless of how well the movie is made simply because there are people who get two touchy-freely about kids in rated R movies--Chloe Moretz was more mature at age 10 then half the adults I know!  Looking forward to this movie being released on DVD in December so I can get a copy.
B008UWEFU6|4.0|I could'nt wait to get my hands on this book. I loved it and will read it again. The only reason I would'nt give this book five stars is because the ending was a little anti-climatic (pun intended).
B000OPOAJS|5.0|May be one of the greatest car chase action movies of all time. To realize that most of the footage is real and not computer-generated gives you a great appreciation for this movie. In many ways I wish today's films not to have such easy access to computer generated images they remind you of people in cartoons with very little reality in the background.
1451666179|5.0|This book is one of the most hilarious things I've ever read.  Yeah, some of it is stuff from her past blog, but I've read it 8 times there, and EVERY TIME I about die laughing.  This book makes a GREAT way for me to share the hilarity of the web to those who say they \\"don't have time\\" to read stuff online or don't know how to \\"work a computer.\\"  I am buying 3 more copies for friends and family for Christmas.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|If you like the original movie the Blu-ray version is even better. Thank God that they didn't have much computer generated graphics when they made this movie they would've killed all the life the real sets brought to it
B00CHVJODE|5.0|This is a great movie.  I preordered it, but it still didn't get mailed out until the release date, so waited a little longer than expected, but that is probably how it's supposed to go.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|This may be my favorite movie of all time. Somewhere in all of us we want to be a rock star with crowds groupies and airplanes and all that goes with it. Watching William chronicle it is really fun. Having been involved in the music industry at the time I can tell you that the story though fiction is pretty close to what really happened.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great book! It was not quite as good as the first book, but it filled out the empty spaces. Frightening to see such events in real life to be like this book. Very thought provoking!! Great Great read
B0038P59A0|3.0|Great acting wonderful plot too bad it is basically a cartoon with human actors. Give me the original Sherlock Holmes with real sets and real places.
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|Great band, great album. If you've enjoyed any of their past albums, you won't be disappointed. Sounds very much like the early sound. Two thumbs up!
B009CF7JDU|4.0|What's not to like about the movie. It is a great fun time and insightful into how parents and children  disconnect in need to work it out.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I like this movie very much, I like the way they decided to re-boot the series by having an alternate time line and the characters are really good and close to the original cast.  Good action and decent storyline, great special effects.  Having Nimoy in the movie too was good,  he is THE SPOCK and I enjoy his appearance on any thing Trek.  The movie was packed very well, and delivered on time.  I also have the movie on my iPhone and every now and then watch while at work on my break.  I do have to say, McCoy has the best lines, I get a good laugh out of his metaphores!!!!!  I hope that they continue with the same cast and have its ongoing mission of making good to great movies!!!!  They really have to, the franchise is now on their shoulders!!!
B003XMKMTQ|4.0|Great blues, great guitars and great vocals. The video is excellent as well as the audio mix. It doesn't get a lot better than this for a live event in an open venue.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Monsters, Inc. arrived on time as usual with Amazon and packed very carefully, My kids were very happy when they opened this package and got to see this movie, the oldest boy fell asleep at the movies when we took him, he was just a little toddler when this movie first came out.  He loved it.  Pixar and Disney always have great graphics and color.  Love the Bluray from these guys.  The whole storyline was very good and very entertaining.  Also, having the DVD is nice, we can have a copy of the movie in the Suburban and the kids can watch it while on long drives during Holiday trips!
B000FC10MU|1.0|I did not care for the writers style nor the contents of this book. I was very disappointed over-all. Would not recommend it.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Easy to read. Nothing flash but just confirmation of what many of us have thought or felt at some point. The author conveys it candidly and clearly.  I really love the book and the structure it was presented.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series--can not wait to see the movies. After they all three come out. The promo looks really really good!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|crush time. this is a fun. game to play doesn't get boring unless you get stuck tor a long time on one level
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|i was looking for a particular song since i did not have. it was on this cd. i bought it ,and i got what i wanted.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|the video is teriffic and the sound is very good.  I would recommend it for anyone who has watched it on Tv.  This version is much better.  Plan to watch it again later.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Great movie. I tend to spoil movies with too many details, but this film  has a bit of maturing as  with just as many laughs as a character  grows.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was amazing I couldn't put it down it never stopped being interesting it never really slowed down it was always fast and exciting can't wait to see the movie I guess we will see if it does the book any justice
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Great book I love it. Very detailed and it teaches a really good lesson. I would highly recommend this book to a friend
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use<br />big screen<br />simple and useful<br />it is a great addition to Kindle<br />So great to have on board
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Paid the money download pretty quick.  Played the 1st chapter then booted out. Will not let me play further. Read in some reviews not compatible w/1st gen fire. They seem pretty compatible with my money.  Should not be able to download if it won't play.  Boo hisssssssss!
B005C0DHEY|4.0|When we think of corruption, it is something that cannot happen here in America. It is a low and demeaning practice that would never take place in our own backyard. WRONG. Corruption just like the disease it causes in this movie is very real, it is unbias, unprejudice and unrelenting once it has taken it's hold. This documentary is a must see. It is a simple reminder of the greed and corruption that happens every day in the backyard of America. This will also leave you wondering \\"how could my own government allow this?\\" Without giving too much away, this movie covers the dangers when signing rights away to corporations who have their quota in mind over the land and health of plants, animals and human beings. There's a good balance of facts and research, along with b-role and interviews of personal accounts.<br /><br />Although this was a great film, this has been the only one Amazon Prime continued to give me problems with while viewing. (Hence the -1 star).
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We saw The Piano Guys on PBS and just had to have their music.We were not disapointed with this cd.I would recomend it to anyone.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Surprisingly “Denn die Toten reiten schnell” or “For the dead travel fast” is more than an opening line to this tale of love in the dangerous moon light. After watching several Drac movies and a few Nosferatu’s, I pretty much though I had a handle on the genera.  Little did I know what a wonderful world of mystery and suspense that Bram Stoker opened up for me.<br /><br />The story is told mostly third party though the papers, diaries, and phonograph recordings (on wax cylinders) of those people involve in a tale so bizarre that it almost defies belief.  The general story line is that of a Count that plans to move to a more urban setting (from Borgo Pass to London) where there is a richer diet. There he finds succulent women; something he can sing his teeth in. Unfortunately for him a gang of ruffians (including a real-estate agent, asylum director, Texas cowboy and an Old Dutch abnormal psychologist) is out to detour his nocturnal munching.  They think they have Drac on the run but with a wing and a prayer he is always one step ahead.<br /><br />Of more value to the reader is the rich prose chosen by Stoker as he describes the morals and technology of the time. We have to come to grips with or decide if we can perform the rituals that are required to eliminate vampires verses the impropriety of opening graves and staking loved ones. The powers in the book differ from the movie versions in that they are more of persuasion and capabilities to manipulate the local weather. At one point the Dutch Dr. Van Helsing, is so overwhelmed by a beautiful vampire laying in the grave that he almost for gets why he is there and may become vamp chow.<br /><br />All in all the story is more in the cunning chase. And the question as to will they succeed or will Dracula triumph.  Remember “For the dead travel fast.”<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002KVULG Dracula]]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 3yo downloaded it and asked for help well I wouldn't give it back lol. I sat here for about 20-30 min if that and with interruptions and finished all 10 levels. I'd love to see more levels I'd definitely play them a good change.
0767919408|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but there wasn't as much wit and humour as I've come to expect from Bill Bryson in it. Still a good read though.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Just one of the classic American movies about &#34;launching&#34; from your high school days and how that change is uncomfortable but exciting.  A fun film portrayal that is right up there with &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; and &#34;American Graffiti&#34; as the best of the 70's and '80s and beyond.  The film script is outstanding writing with very good acting efforts from young and old alike.
006202406X|4.0|Allegiant was one of my anticipated books of 2013, I really didn't know how Veronica Roth could wrap up the series successfully. Allegiant was panned by fans and many fans felt that this book ruined the entire series for them. Then there's me, one of the few \\"black sheeps\\" who actually enjoyed this book and felt that it was extremely necessary that it ended this way.<br /><br />  Allegiant is nearly impossible to describe because there's just so many subplots going on at the same time. At any given moment, there are at least 5 or 6 different storylines that Roth is telling and it's a bit overwhelming at times. This is definitely the most complicated of all of the books in the series and I guess it makes sense, given the fact that Roth needed to somehow conclude the series in a satisfying way.<br /><br />  Finally readers will learn what being \\"divergent\\" really means for Tris and Four. Tris and Four's relationship is definitely tested in this one and there is a lot of bickering between the two. I just wanted them to make up and just resolve their differences; it does make sense that they are constantly on edge due to hectic nature of their lives. When there aren't fighting (which wasn't very often), there were some very sweet moments between the two. The romance in this one is pretty light, but we do get to see more of what's going on in Four's head.<br /><br />  I completely understand why Veronica Roth decided to write in Tris and Four's point of views, but it wasn't up to par with the high quality writing that was evident in previous books. There were times when Tris and Four sounded way too similar and I had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to find out whose point of view I was reading. There were other times when I had really enjoy Four's point of view because it was extremely revealing and it was completely unbarred. The reader slowly learns to understand why Four is such an enigmatic force and why he keeps himself so reserved from Tris. I really felt like Four's point of view was extremely vital to understanding who he is and how much he cares for Tris. I do wish that the writing was tighter in some of Four's chapters to make his voice more distinct for the reader.<br /><br />  The side characters in Allegiant have been called undeveloped and unimaginative by so many reviewers, but I disagree. All of the secondary characters (both new and familiar faces) place an extremely important part in helping Four and Tris make decisions. The secondary characters help raise the stakes, they help Four and Tris realize that everything isn't going to end perfectly like they had hoped. Each character has their own specific purpose and rightful place in Allegiant, it was truly something special to see my favorite characters from the series interact with new characters.<br /><br />  I have to address the way Allegiant ended because it's caused so much controversy  Veronica Roth received death threats after fans had read the ending. IT'S NEVER OKAY TO SEND SOMEONE DEATH THREATS, I thought that was common sense, but apparently not. The ending of Allegiant is so ballsy and was such a risky move on Veronica Roth's part; Roth had the guts to pull off something most authors wouldn't even dream of doing. This is why Roth has sold millions of books because she pushes the limits and is always creating ingenious plotlines. Anyway, I felt that this ending felt inevitable, Roth even said that she always felt like she knew it would end like this. After a bit of pondering, it all made sense to me and I felt like Roth had been leading up to this ending ever since Divergent. In fact, if you read Insurgent, there's tons of foreshadowing that hinted that Allegiant would end like this. Allegiant's ending felt necessary to me and I really feel that this is the ONLY ending that truly would have worked. While I didn't love the ending, I felt that Allegiant's conclusion was extremely effective.<br /><br />  Though Allegiant is extremely slow-pacedand slugs due to info-dumping, I really enjoyed the final installment in the Divergent trilogy. Allegiant didn't provide readers with the happily ever after that readers were looking for, instead it provided readers with an extremely realistic ending. As much as I would have loved Four and Tris to ride into the sunset on an unicorn, Allegiant had to end in such a manner. Allegiant has solidified my love for Veronica Roth's writing abilities and it ended on a satisfying note, in my mind. I really look forward to reading Roth's future books and I hope that Roth will continue to defy all odds with her incredible books. There's no denying that Veronica Roth is dauntless after reading Allegiant, it takes an extremely brave and daring individual to write an extremely controversial ending without fearing retaliation from fans.and slugs due to info-dumping, I really enjoyed the final installment in the Divergent trilogy.

B00EVCD9HY|4.0|I'd love to give this album five stars because I absolutely love the variety of sounds and the creativity that abounds.  If only there were more new artists like her, modern music would be so much more interesting.  For me, a five-star album needs to just kill it throughout, which this album mostly does, though I'll admit that there are a few tracks that probably won't stay on my playlist, but that's the paradox:  I love that she takes it all over the place, I just don't love everywhere she takes it.  Still, I totally support everything she's doing and can't wait to hear more!
B006M4F67A|3.0|It is like most mahjong games I have played in the past. The biggest problem for me has always been getting use to the tile patterns.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Not Def Leppard, not Dokken, not Motley Crue, not Poison, not Europe, not Ratt, not Scorpions, none of the 80s metal bands have made a comeback that lived up to what they used to be. The recent Stryper albums came close, but it still felt like they are just a shadow of what they used to be. I've always ranked Stryper in a higher class than most of the 80s bands. This album is the pudding that proves it.<br /><br />I've been a die hard Stryper fan since 1987. They helped me get through some difficult High School years. It's hard to admit, but this is their best work, even better than their Platinum to hell with the devil. The only downside is that many of the songs left me wanting more, especially the guitar riffs. Buy this! It will blow your mind.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This game it kind of like mario brothers with jumping and other action movements. I personall have never been that good at this type of game but the grandkids are naturals.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once you get passed the writing style, the book is rather good and it is not just an erotic novel. It follows a story line, develops the characters and if you continue to read the other 2 books you will not be disappointed. It is a great love story full of erotica, passion, love, family, wedding, drama, kidnapping, attempted murder......
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This started out to be a simple little game. it was cute in nature. but after you get in a few levels it is like all those crappie facebook names. where to get feature you have to like it on face book. I just wanted something I could kill time in my down time without being on the net.
B003XYERRM|4.0|This was a very interesting book with quite a different spin on the 2 young heirs. I enjoyed this book.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|5stars and a great reference for living!-love the end with all the poetic philosophy so harshly learned through the life-journey that this book takes the reader along for...inspiring and a truly great read
B00902AKK4|5.0|Other peoples reviews are better that what I could write but I love both the puzzle aspect of it as well as the general design so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. it is soooooo much fun to play.  one of my favorites. I play it all the time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I found it perplexing to say the least how these two world wars came to be. By following the lives of people on all sides Follett paints the true picture of war and how painful and useless it is for all. A fascinating web of real history through the eyes of those that lived it. Highly recommended.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Great Violin Instrumental Music.  The artist did great for violin lovers.  I loved it and it's great for a daily wind down.  Great to listen to prior to sleeping too.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to the next in this series.  Brandon is becoming one of my “go to” authors.  This book is almost geared to a younger audience, but it keeps an adult feel throughtout.  If you haven’t read any of Brandon’s books, this would be a good place to start.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie, can not wait for the new movie to can out. Glad I rented it before, I went to the new show. It looks like it is going to tie together.
B00F2362IE|1.0|bought this game for my 7 year old.this game loads to often and freezes all the time. he doesnt want to play it because its so frustrating.don't waste your money.
B009TQ77KM|3.0|This \\"Limited Edition\\" screwdriver is visibly indistinguishable from the normal edition of this toy. Functionally, it's identical in nearly every way except when it's extended. The batteries for this screwdriver are housed in the main emitter unit (the part with the light on the end), which detaches completely from the housing during battery installation. This causes the main emitter unit to be top heavy, and as such, it will not remain extended when held in a vertical position unless you hold it there. Held horizontally, it will remain extended with no problems or hindrance to function.<br /><br />If you extend it and then activate it, the pressure will allow it to remain extended when held vertically. However, once you release pressure from the activation switch, it will immediately sink back into the housing.<br /><br />Other than this, it's the same as the normal sonic. Comes with the regular/invisible ink nibs and all.  I'd pass on this and get the other if you want the toy and not just a collectible that sits in its packaging forever.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|runs great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Hours of fun for $2. Responsive to the gravitational tablet steering and touch screen.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun, but I don't want to annoy my facebook friends with updates so I didn't link. So in order to progress you have to link with FB, pay, or wait 24 hours between 3 quests. Annoying! I've enjoyed it, but I don't see it staying on my Kindle for much longer. I can see a one time paid upgrade to go on, but this thing is set up to slowly suck up all your money.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|Mozart doesn't get any better than this outstanding collection,Perahia is really without peer when it comes to Mozart and is equally adept with the Beethoven set. Wonderfully recorded, fine balance between piano and orchestra.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game I have it on my phone also. Couldn't wait for it to hit the kindle. I'm so addicted
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Awesome jumper!  We LOVE it!  :o)  We bought the Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo for our daughter and use at our house, which she loved.  However, we needed another jumper since my Mom was babysitting our son and wanted one of her own.  So after reading through reviews, we bought the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo.  Our son absolutely LOVES it and is the happest little guy in it.<br /><br />- We actually prefer the Rainforest Jumperoo over the Luv U Zoo because the toys seems to be lower to his level.  Not sure why but he seems to have an easier time playing with the Rainforest one.<br />- We like how the Rainforest Jumperoo has a round base as compared to the Luv U Zoo base because it takes up less room.<br />- We like how the Rainforest Jumperoo base pivots to be made smaller when not in use.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|The novel starts off as a very good international thriller. However, it quickly flat lines.<br />I normally like Mr. DeMille's novels. This, unfortunately, is an exception. I found it far too lengthy, boring and grew weary of John Corey's cheesy jokes. He's just not funny.<br />At over 600 pages, much being repetitious dialogue, the book could easily have been pared down quite a bit.<br />After the action in the first chapter, the reader needs to get to approx. 1/2 the way through before anything really happens again. The main characters have just taken a very long drive through the desert. They successfully deal with an ambush attempt. The description of the trip is akin to hours of boredom, interrupted by a few minutes of action. That just about describes the entire book. There is just so much repetitious dialogue and description. Neither does anything to add to the story. The book never advances to the thriller stage. I found myself just scanning ahead. I like character development, dialogue, and description. But, here, I found myself wanting to nod off.<br />Mr. DeMille also needs to can Corey's corny jokes. They aren't funny, yet they pepper the entire book. They distract the reader's attention since they consistently interrupt the plot. The jokes are found in other John Corey books and are overdone, as well. Here they are a glaring annoyance since the book is so glaringly lacking.<br /><br />The end game has a good twist or two. But, by that time, I barely cared. I was happy it was the end. You can easily pass on this one.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I did not like this application. I know it is because of the ads. If you use the other app that Amazon offers for free, you will have a better viewing experience. If you like moving, changing, and disturbing ads, by all means download the product. Do not say I did not warn you.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|Couldn't put it down! It brought me back to Jeffrey Archer after a very long time, and I'm now going to read more of his more recent novels. Loved the twists and turns of the plot, the characters were great - the whole experience was one I have told others about. I was sorry it came to an end.

B00004YA66|5.0|Frequency is the best movie of all time, but maybe it just seems like that to me since I lost my dad 50 years ago when I was the same age as the son in this story.  And, of all of the World Series \\"match ups,\\" I recall the 1969 World Series the best.  If the Mets had not stolen the Cubs' pennant that year, history would have been so different.<br /><br />Great plot twists throughout.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|This was a very enjoyable, entertaining, well done movie.  If it wasn't this easily available, I'd buy it on DVD.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is the 3rd time I've read this book and I still find the four agreements to be relevant and touching.
B00FQAZ7PW|2.0|Yikes... what were Pearl Jam doing the past four years that has affected their music so poorly? This isn't an awful album - but by PJ standards, it is fair, at best. There are a few pretty good songs (Getaway, Yellow Moon), but not a single song jumps out as great - which has always happened on past PJ albums at least a few times. This album is for hardcore PJ fans only. For newbies - look into Vs., or Yield.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Where to you begin to write about Wilkie Collins?  He was a contemporary of Dickens, and the two of them worked jointly in a number of projects.  But there's a big difference between the two writers:  Collins is better than Dickens!  Don't know why more attention was not given to him in the classes in literature that I took while in school.  His writing is clearer, more animated and his mysteries are intriguing.  Great, great literature.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|it surprised me how entertaining it really was.  I do not typically like this type of game.  would recommend to anyone
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|The only thing that would make this better would be video of 'Circus' and 'Fathers Eyes'.<br />Amazon had a great price as well.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala is amazing. I think of her as the Anne Frank of our century. She writes of her life, intertwined with political upheaval, and personal tragedy. Malala was shot in the face by a Taliban assassin, who was trying to silence her. Her strength and her spirit are inspiring.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Not as good as the first film.<br />Great cast- good characters.<br />It gets pretty predictable at a certain point. But, hey- it's Trek- gotta love it!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent, reading through both of them in a couple of day, caring so much about the characters and wanting to know what happens next.  I couldn't wait for Alligent and was sadly disappointed.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wow...wow. I absolutely loved this story. I couldn't put it down. I cried and I laughed, which I haven't done in a book in a long time. There's something extremely compelling to me about Sorna. He's got a quiet resolve and his character is not forced upon the reader. He comes alive effortlessly on his own and I find him captivating.<br />I'm sure if I reread and reread this book a hundred times I could walk away with some criticism. But I'm am content to deliberately not seek any. I put this book down feeling like I was gifted a great story and I have no need or reason to criticize it.<br />All I can humbly say is: Thank you, Anthony Ryan.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Amazing telling of facts of world events told thru compelling personal stories of interwoven lives of people affected. Gripping reading that you can't put down.
0553386794|2.0|I know, I know! I'm one of the few. I just couldn't get into it. I tried. I have a hard time saying why, too.<br />I liked the prologue enough, and I thought I was in for a treat. But after a few hundred pages, I found myself not reading as I read. It seemed a chore to pick up. After I started dreading it, I stopped reading. I found that I didn't care for any characters yet, which for me, is a must if I'm gong to read. I have to at least be mildly interested in SOMEBODY. I hear it gets better. But with so many other options, I want better now. :)<br />As for the series being 'different' or 'fresh', I'm not so sure. It didn't feel all the revolutionary to me, but then again, I didn't get far.<br />Regardless, I enjoy the old school fantasy books full of hope and cheesy dialog. I do LOVE a dark book crammed with one obstacle after another until you feel you can't breathe while reading because everything seems so hopeless. You know, the one you actually ache in sympathy for the main character who gets knocked down only to rise and hit repeat because they refuse to give up. I didn't FEEL anything in GOT. No humor, sadness, cheering, yelling at the characters. Nothing.<br />So for me, I couldn't finish it.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wow, did not expect that I would like this game so much- but it is fun. Some of the levels have been a real challenge. I personally like that it limits your play when you struggle with a level- makes you take a break and come back refreshed. I have made it past level 50 and never had to buy any &quot;helps&quot; so far. Enjoy!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This has to be my top favorite Romance/Drama movie. It really sets emotion throughout the whole movie. One second I’ll be laughing and the next I’ll be crying. It really makes you think of past experiences and the memories you’ve encountered with someone else. It truly reaches out to me and sends a great message. “Don’t Lose the ones you love.”<br /> In The Notebook I felt that Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling did a brilliant job telling a love story. It kept me very intrigued on their acting skills and the realism they put in their roles. Nicolas Sparks wrote this book and Nick Cassavetes turned it into a movie and I really like how you can read a book and compare it to the movie. It defiantly explains more in the book but it is worth watching to get the full experience. Another thing that really caught my attention was the setting (back then) the movie was taken in. I felt that there was more lovey scenes and romance compared today, so I guess I really like the history of the film and how different we can compare it to today.<br /> Even though I really liked the ending I wish it didn’t end the way it did. It defiantly shows really good emotion again, but I wish it went on talking about their kids and expanding just a little farther into detail about their love life.<br /> Overall I would give The Notebook five stars out of five stars. Whenever you’re feeling down about a relationship consisting of family, friends, or boyfriend/girlfriend, I highly suggest watching The Notebook. Listen to the messages it sends out and grab a bucket of ice cream and a box of tissues and wait to laugh and cry your eyes out.

1451696191|4.0|Perks Of Being A Wallflower<br />by Stephen Chbosky<br /> Perks of Being a Wallflower is like no other book you will read out there. It is made for young adults and really connects with the reader, if you're in that age group. There are many books out there that speak about high school life and being a teenager but none like this one, anybody in high school knows about the hardships you have to go through with, friends, homework,teachers and parties. All of those elements of the book helps, relate to it.<br /> Perks of Being a Wallflower is about a young boy named Charlie, who has gone through something devastating over the summer break, before his first year in High school. His best friend kills himself, over the summer. He is nervous about going in to High school alone without his best friend to be there with him along the way. To help his peace of mind he starts writing letters to an unknown person and that's what you get to read all the letters about his year.<br /> Along the way he meets a mentor named Bill, his English teacher. With the help from his teacher he learns to overcome his anxiety and shyness. He starts talking to his classmate Patrick and his step-sister becomes his best friends. During the course of the school year, Charlie has his first date and his first kiss, he experiments with drugs and alcohol, makes new friends and loses some. There are some parts in the book that don't make sense at first but if you keep reading you will find out, it makes you want to keep reading to find out. He has a secret that nobody knows about that has bothered him since he was little but has chosen to ignore, until it surfaces back in to his head and has a mental breakdown. He has to be hospitalized. He feels relief after he gets let out of the hospital because he forgives his aunt for what she had done to him.<br /> This book is great for a teenager in High school or is going to be soon. Anybody in that age group will like it in one way or another because they canrelate to what is going on in the book to their lives. Anybody out of the that age range won't be such a big fan of the book. Overall this book is good but is targeted for a specific audience. If you're not in that audience you may not enjoy this book too much.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Although the very beginning of the book is gruesome, it kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.

B004RFWZNY|4.0|If I was rating this by performance only then I would have to give it a 5.  The Allman Brothers were really hot at this stage in their career, reforming after a lacklustre period at the end of the 80's.  Warren Haynes is a suburb guitarist and Dickey Betts had to pull out all stops to show he was just as good (and he certainly was in this concert).<br /><br />The video quality is poor.  The sound is also poor with little top end or bass.  I found that increasing the bass on my receiver (something I rarely do) helped.  Use the 2.0 mix, not the \\"5.1\\" mix.  The sound is basically mono.  If you have an amp/receiver that can simulate a hall or other surround mode from a mono source then use it, as it will help fill out the sound.<br /><br />Don't be put off by another reviewer who gave this DVD only 1 star.  You will be buying it for a first class performance by the Allman Brothers at a peak period in their career and the video/audio quality is of less importance.  Think of it as a classic b&w movie or a classic 78 rpm record - performance outweighs everything else.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing story you've never heard of!  Henrietta Lacks was a woman who lived in the mid 20th century in Virginia/Maryland, and unfortunately, died from cervical cancer.  A culture of her cancer cells known as &#34;HeLa&#34; survives to this day, and has been used to make amazing breakthroughs in medical science.  This is the story of the woman from whom these miraculous cells arose, and the unfortunate lapses in biomedical ethics which have forced her into obscurity.  This is a must-read for anyone involved in biological or medical science!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is a must buy for td lovers. Now you might be thinking why get this when I can get it on the computer for free? Well I'm going to tell you why you should get it on hand held devices. 1. It has 2 special towers. 2. It is handheld and has co-op. And the main reason I got it is the beautiful graphics and I love this game. This is definitely a must have game.
0345529057|5.0|Four amazing books for a very low price!  Read the story everyone's talking about!  A Song of Ice and Fire is an epic fantasy series, on par with the Lord of The Rings and may be one of the most important pieces of fantasy literature of our time!

B007R11DKQ|4.0|My family really enjoyed this comedy. The actors played roles which were different from the ones they typically played. It was filled with moments of laughter and a few surprises. Claire Danes shined as the fallen star in a magical land which allowed her to be in human form. Captured by a young man, and chased by an evil witch, saved by pirates, these are some of her adventures in this sweet faerie tale.

B005LN5UOC|4.0|The EX03 was very easy to pair with my PS3, worked well, and was so comfortable to wear that I almost forgot that I had it on. It is also surprisingly compact - much more so than the product photos indicate, and looks durable enough to last me a while.<br /><br />~A_E~

B000MV90F8|5.0|Insightful look at piece of history from WWII (most of which is true says ending credits) that few folks know about.  Beautiful scenery too.  Video quality is very good and colors were virbrant; sound tracks very clear (English). This is a two-disc video because of film length.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Overall good and fun app that will keep you busy and is very addicting! Happy I got this great app.
1451627297|4.0|Though this novel is well over 800 pages, it goes pretty fast once you started.  King kept me guessing and kept me wanting more.  Other reviewers have mentioned that King took overly long to tell his story, which may be true, but I enjoyed even the long parts.  I do wish though, that King would have transported US back into time better.  Yes, he mentions there's no air conditioning and no cell phones, etc., but I didn't really feel I was ever transported back into the 50's and 60's -- the sense of time and place seemed not much different than 2013 (maybe that was his point, but I don't think so).  I was so disappointed that I wasn't completely immersed in a time I barely remember.<br /><br />Sadie didn't seem like a woman of the 50's at all -- maybe that was his point too -- but I would have liked it if I were given a better glimpse of what it would have been like to live as a normal woman in the 50's.<br /><br />There were some confusing parts, like the yellow card men whose function in this novel I didn't get.<br /><br />I know more now about the Kennedy assassination and the Oswalds and learning about them was a pleasure!  Four stars for a unique and entertaining read.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I have been a faithful Stryper listener for many years, and have enjoyed most everything they have released.  \\"No More Hell to Pay\\" has captured the best of Stryper: tight vocal harmonies, hook laden melodies, meaningful lyrics, phat guitars, hot licks and a pumpin rythm section.  The new release went beyond though.  Refining and updating all those elements, delivering a hotter, leaner, meaner Stryper.<br /><br />This is hard rock/metal at its best.
0307341550|5.0|Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn is a thrilling and authentic novel that balances eeriness and mystery with one woman’s struggles with herself and her family. This book follows journalist Camille Preaker back to her hometown in Wind Gap, Missouri, to investigate the deaths of two little girls. As the crime unfolds, Camille finds that the case hits a little too close to home.<br /> Two little girls around the age of ten were murdered in a similar manner, with their teeth pulled out and strangled. In such a small town, rumors fly, and different people, all closely connected to the girls, were suspected of the murders. Camille begins to remember her life in Wind Gap, and bad memories are dug up. Her sister died when she was 13, and from that point on she suffered with self harm issues: she even had to be institutionalized for it. Being around her crazy mother and fake friends begin to trigger Camille again, and she imagines words flaring up on her body like “nasty” and “wicked”.<br /> Camille also has a thirteen year old half sister named Amma, who appears saintly and innocent to her mother, but by night she’s an insane teenager (drugs, alcohol, sex, you name it!). Amma and her crew of three other girls are into some very shady stuff, and at one point, they drag Camille into it. Camille has a few love interests, but none last, as she struggles with her paranoia and shies away from commitment. Her mother, Adora, begins forcing a great deal of powerful mdecine on Camille and Amma even though they are not sick, and Camille begins to question her mother’s sanity. Eventually, the true murderer is convicted, but it’s definitely not would you would expect.<br /> One concept about this book is that it can be very graphic at times. Even for me, an avid fan of murder mysteries and gory TV shows, Sharp Objects still induced a wince from time to time. One example is when the body of Natalie Keene is found: “Wedged in the foot-wide space between the hardware store and the beauty parlor was a tiny body, aimed at the sidewalk… I recognized the wild curls. But the grin was gone. She looked like a plastic baby doll, the kind with a built-in hole for bottle feedings. Natalie had no teeth now. [28]” It’s slightly creepier than normal because it’s a ten year old child who was murdered, and I think that can be quite sensitive to some people. The main character, Camille, also has a history with self harm. The visuals, while masterfully done, paint an extremely vivid picture in your mind: “I remember feeling that word, heavy and slightly sticky on my pubic bone. My mother’s steak knife. Cutting like a child among red imaginary lines. Cleaning myself. Digging in deeper. Cleaning myself. Pouring bleach over the knife and sneaking through the kitchen to return it. Wicked. Relief. [60-61]” There’s also a fair amount of sexual content, but it never lasts more than a page. Of course, judging a thriller for its graphic content isn’t entirely fair. From reading the synopsis on the back, or even just looking at the cover page, you can figure out that it isn’t exactly a PG-rated story.<br /> Overall, I loved Sharp Objects. It’s the very definition of a “page-turner”. In almost every paragraph it seemed that there was another plot twist. I spent just one night reading it, and for days I couldn’t stop thinking about it. It was so “messed up” and mind boggling that it took a while for me to wrap my head around it. Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer. I fell in love with her first book, Gone Girl, and now Sharp Objects. Her ideas profoundly original, and she finds an excellent way to portray a complicated story in a coherent way. I can’t wait to see what Flynn accomplishes in the future.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am planning a trip to France in one year.  I do have some &#34;lost&#34;  knowledge of French from high school and college (years ago).  But, big but, if language is not heard, read, spoken, knowledge is slowly lost.  This course is fantastic.  No conjugation, language is taught the way we learned our native language.  The opportunity to hear French spoken is a great plus; if you take this course seriously, you will learn.  Review is important, and when not comfortable, it is easy to go back a lesson.  So glad I found this app.  Highly recommend.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Traveling around I always need an extra cable to keep my Kindle in prime running condition.  In other words I never leave home without it and found this to be as good a quality as the original.
B00DYEBM2Y|5.0|Wow, what a return. They could have tried a different direction, introduced a new sound. Thankfully they chose not to and have delivered an album that effortlessly sits alongside their other pieces. Whilst there may not be a chart topping single amongst the new collection the whole album is a delight and is a joy to listen to. Let's hope the next album is released within a decade!
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|I read a review for this game on The Verge, so I decided to buy it. I usually don't buy apps, but since I got a Kindle Fire, I've been playing a lot more. This game is perfect for the tablet, the art is beautiful and the game plays very smoothly. It has Amazon game circle implementation for achievements and leaderboards if you are into that.<br />There is an additional 100MB download after the initial download. The only &quot;ads&quot; you get are promotions for other games, and I only saw one after playing for 10 minutes.
B0044WUQ3G|5.0|if you want to watch a scary movie but dont get into horror and ghost type stuff this movie is for you. its a very emotinally moving movie so be prepared for that.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I read some of the reviews--no spoiler ones--before reading this book.  I loved Divergent and Insurgent, so no matter what I was reading Allegiant.  Some of the comments had me wondering what I was getting into, but it was so worth reading.  I think having both Tris and Four's viewpoints from chapter to chapter helped finally get his viewpoint--we mostly only had Tris's viewpoint in the first two books.  I think we learned a lot more about their true feelings in this book and their acceptance that although they were both Dauntless, they were still different in how they saw things and wanted to solve them, but they still loved each other.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are because it wasn't all wrapped up at the end in the fairy tale package like most YA trilogies have been.  This was more real.  I admit it made me cry in parts (I won't spoil it with what parts), but I think it was supposed to make you feel what they were feeling.<br /><br />Someone said in one of the reviews that Peter never showed remorse for his actions in the other books then he does in this one--did they not read Insurgent--Peter is the one who saved Tris from death at the hands of Jeanine then when the factionless took over, he stayed near his mother and didn't participate--he was already hating himself then.  He was never meant to be a good guy, but he always knew he should try to be better--he just never could put forth the effort to do good instead of evil.<br /><br />No book is perfect, so I think the criticism of this one has been a bit harsh, but I still liked it.  It did remind me of the Matched trilogy in the memory erasure, but all these YA dystopian novels have similarities.  At least there was no love triangle in this one--Tris and Four loved only each other--I still refuse to call him Tobias.  Now I get to wait to see how they destroy the novels for the movies...hate to see the amazon reviews when they release the movies.

B002PJN59M|4.0|John Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" is an ambitious attempt to capture the scope and complexity of Arthurian legend into one full-length movie, stretching from the circumstances of Arthur's birth to his death and journey to Avalon. Despite the huge swathes of material it has to cover, the film manages to be coherent, and some of the choices in combining characters and relying on potent imagery in order to get the point across are pretty clever. At the same time the Duke of Cornwall is being graphically impaled by a spear, Uther is visiting Igraine in the guise of her husband, and the state of Arthur's kingdom is signified in how shiny the armour of his knights are - and trust me, that armour can get pretty damn shiny. We're talking a blinding mirror-quality level sheen here.<br /><br />But naturally any degree of character nuance has to be obliterated in favour of plot. Divided into five parts, the first deals with Uther's pursuit of Igraine, the second the Sword in the Stone and Arthur's attempts to prove himself as king, the third Lancelot and Guenevere, the fourth Perceval's quest for the Holy Grail, and the fifth Arthur and the battle of Camlann. Strewn throughout are some staple parts of Arthurian legend (the Lady of the Lake, the Round Table, shiny swords, mysterious castles, bad tempered bridge-keepers, knights that go crazy at the drop of a hat) and it covers about sixty years in total.<br /><br />It's entertaining enough, though a lot of it has aged terribly. That it was filmed in the eighties is unmistakable thanks to all the ginormous hair and hideous clothes, and though I have no idea whether the full-body plate armour was accurate or not, it looks ridiculous. Fight scenes are generally composed of people lurching uncontrollably at each other in the attempt to land a blow, but the armour makes it virtually impossible to move.<br /><br />And yeesh, no one in this movie has an indoor voice. I'm certain that at least 70% of all the lines are screamed or shouted or bellowed, usually rendering the line utterly incoherent, complete with rolling eyes and massive gesticulations.<br /><br />But there are some beautiful outdoor scenes (Arthur and Guenevere's wedding comes to mind), some great use of Richard Wagner and \\"O Fortuna\\", and plenty of familiar (albeit youthful) faces: Helen Mirren as Morgana, Patrick Stewart as Leondegrance, Liam Neeson as Gawaine, Gabriel Byrne as Uther and Robert Addie as Mordred (okay, you may not be entirely familiar with that last one, but he's the man who played Guy of Gisborne in [[ASIN:B00180IPQW Robin of Sherwood]]).<br /><br />In regards to the performances, it's largely Nicol Williamson as Merlin who's the standout, but Helen Mirren is also a lot of fun as Morgana. It's a rare example of Morgana being portrayed as a blonde, and they transfer some of the Merlin/Nimue relationship to her as well, making her the one responsible for trapping Merlin in the crystal cave after learning what she can from him. The time restraints make it impossible to properly explore her motivation on turning on Arthur, but there's a nice indication that her animosity toward Merlin is born out of her awareness of his role to play in Uther's rape of her mother.<br /><br />As for Nigel Terry, I'm beginning to think that the role of King Arthur is to actors what the fairytale princess trope is to actresses: an impossible task. It's not that he's bad, but much like Richard Harris, Sean Connery, Clive Owen, Paul Curran, Edward Atterton and (oy) Jamie Campbell Bower, he just seems completely overwhelmed by the material. King Arthur needs to dominate. And dominate effortlessly. As it stands, Nigel Terry is convincingly aged from a teenager to an old man over the course of the film, and gets some nice line readings here and there, but I never really felt within myself that this was a man and king who could change the world.<br /><br />This certainly isn't something that you want to sit your kids down in front of, for \\"Excalibur\\"is filled with nudity and bloody violence, as well as the usual staples of Arthurian legend: incest and adultery.<br /><br />If I was to sum up the film as a whole, I would say it's a bit of a mess. But it's an *interesting* mess, and sometimes that's good enough. Personally, I don't think anyone has come close to creating the absolute, definitive, by-which-all-others-shall-be-judged version of the Arthurian legends, and to be honest, I doubt anyone ever will. But this valiantly makes the attempt.is filled with nudity and bloody violence, as well as the usual staples of Arthurian legend: incest and adultery.<br /><br />If I was to sum up the film as a whole, I would say it's a bit of a mess.

B000002JSJ|5.0|I felt compelled to write a 5 star review of Led Zeppelin's Presence after noticing that all other Zep releases up to Presence have received reviews averaging 4.5 stars and Presence has averaged only 4 stars.  Maybe it is just my OCD kicking in, but I cannot just sit idly by while reviewers give this record less praise than its predecessors.  I have been listening to Zeppelin since I was a child in the early seventies when my dad forced Stairway to Heaven on my ears over and over again.  At the time, I remember thinking &#34;well, it is okay&#34;.  As I aged into my teens, my assessment of Stairway improved and, like many, would list it as one of best rock'n'roll songs ever (if not THE best).  I grew to love nearly all of Zeppelin's stuff at that time.  However, my favorite Zep record was (and still is) Presence.  As many reviewers here have stated, Achilles Last Stand is one of Zeppelin's best ever songs.  But to me, the BEST song Zeppelin ever recorded is Tea for One!!  Tea for One is the finest, most moving piece of blues-rock I've ever heard and I get goose bumps just thinking about it.  And the songs between Achilles and Tea are great, too - THERE IS NO FILLER ON THIS RECORD.  Please, people, give Presence another listen.  And then listen to it again and again - it is a thing of true beauty.  It is in NO way inferior to its predecessors - you don't need to compare it to them (in fact, you shouldn't because it is something altogether different from its siblings and you'd be comparing apples and oranges).  It is time for this record to get the respect it deserves.<br />Please join me in writing 5 star reviews for Presence - Do it for art; do it for justice; do it for future generations!

B0081SRJSY|5.0|This video version of the now classic board game plays pretty much like the original.  It's a smooth transition from the table to the tablet for casual and hardcore gamers alike.  I played the board game version for the first time a year ago and had to buy it right away.  it's a must for any board game collection.  If you are looking for a quick and easy way to have all the fun of the original version, this will interest you.  It's still a value at full price.  You won't be disappointed.

B0087FMUCQ|2.0|I have played the &#34;flicking paper&#34; games and they are fun little time fillers.  I thought I would like this one a lot because of the golf theme.  I give the game four stars for the look of it.  It's almost worth downloading for the visual aspect because it's less cartoony than the &#34;flicking paper&#34; games.  Unfortunately, it's darn near impossible to play because, no matter how hard I flicked, I could almost never get the ball far enough to make some of these, and you had to hit some of the shots incredibly hard to keep the ball from going into the water.  For this, I would give it a zero, so it averages out at two stars.  If you want to try it, be ready for a little frustration, but maybe you will be better at it than I am. Best of luck!

B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This isn't a bad notepad app.  It's just really limited.  I have downloaded a bunch of these note taking apps and this one isn't badly designed, but there isn't as much you can do as there is with other apps like it.  It works smoothly, but the only real use for it is making a list and using it almost right away, which makes it a disposable app.  You can make a list or take notes and they will remain there until you delete them, but you can only make the one.  What you type in will stay there, even if you close the program, but there isn't an option to make other notes.  In fact, there isn't any options at all.  All you can do is make a note and that's it.  I think I like the icon for the app better than the app itself.  I like the leather notebook and the fine pen, but this is a three star app at best for being very average.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved the book. Being five years out of high school, this book brought me back to my days of spending hours in the library reading about Greek gods and goddesses. It was such an awesome read with both super serious and hysterical moments. I can't wait to read the second one.

1401232590|5.0|Can Batman, Gordon, and Harvey Dent find the mysterious killer that is terrorizing Gotham and its most powerful gangsters? Loeb and Sale paint a beautiful picture of Batman in his early days; young and full of energy. As more and more clues are found, the evidence points to Harvey Dent. The story leads its readers in all directions, questioning what they thought they knew and who is the killer after every page. By the end, you will be so shocked, in a good way, that you will want to read it again to see if you can see it coming, thats at least what I did. You won't be able to put this book down. Sale's artwork is wonderful and compliments the great story of Loeb so well. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of good comic books and a fan of Batman.

B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This was a definitely fresh breath of relief for today's horror.<br />Today's horror: nothing but sex, excessive swearing, completely unnecessary murdering, just showing off the newest movie-making technology to show how well we can do the next craziest thing.<br />In this, yes, there is swearing, but as meaningless as I'd imagined. No sex, though, not even any thorough nudity, though a tree acting all rapist? That's reminiscent of the original but on script-written acid in this case. All the killing is contextually sensitive and makes sense in each case.<br />Most importantly for me is that this has what I barely find at all in today's horror movie: a substantial story that gives an element of hope. Five friends (two being siblings) come to an isolated cabin. Yeah, seems like just a sexcapade of a getaway, only it turns out four have an ulterior motive for the last, who's recovering from an addiction to drugs. If this were a typical Hollywood horror movie, they could have left that out and just keep the ultra-gory violence in and it would be no different.<br />This is from the original filmmakers, though, so that's a key factor. There was hope in the originals (albeit with downright darkly quirky humor), now it's taken as a serious storytelling device in quite a serious story.<br />And then... the violence. Heaps of it, the first being the immolation of a demon-possessed girl. Even with a hint of CGI, it's eye-gripping. Then comes the rest that show the immolation may have been completely impressive, but it was nothing but a hint of what was to come. Dismemberment abound, completely broken fingers, split hands, even a woman pulling off her hand (rather graphically, from skin-tearing to tendons coming apart to veins breaking), and even for one whole scene, the rain itself is blood. Yes, tremendously ominous throughout. Even a little thing like a syringe needle getting stuck in a person's eyelid got rather creepy.<br />Yet it would have been nothing but showing off if it weren't for the strong story of paranoia and the education of trusting one another. Not to mention the heavy element of self-sacrifice, can't forget that one.<br />Now to wait for the sequel.f it weren't for the strong story of paranoia and the education of trusting one another.

B001R10BM8|2.0|Thanks to some bizarre copyright issues, the rights to the James Bond novel Thunderball were never completely held by the traditional Bond production team.<br /><br />Thus, another movie or movies could be made by another company with a screenplay based on Thunderball. Never Say Never Again was the result in 1983, with Sean Connery returning as James Bond 11 years after he had last played the role in Diamonds are Forever.<br /><br />Roger Moore's tenure as Bond was winding down in 1983, though that year's official Bond entry, Octopussy, still outgrossed this movie. Connery looks game but a little tired here, and the pacing seems off, and the movie overlong by about 20 minutes and one too many changes of locale. Klaus Maria Brandauer does make for a surprisingly sinister Bond villain, while Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger do OK work as Bond girls evil and good, respectively.<br /><br />The tone shifts even more abruptly than usual for a Bond film, from parodic to serious and back again. That may partially be because of the screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple, who helped turn both the Batman tv series of the 1960's and the 1980 Flash Gordon film into smirking parodies of themselves. It's not quite Camp here, but it's close. M and the rest of the Bond hierarchy take the most severe beating, though Rowan Atkinson's first big-screen appearance, as an MI6 operative played solely for laughs, also grates. Bernie Casey is fine as CIA agent Felix Leiter, and actually has something to do other than supply exposition.<br /><br />The prime oddity of Never Say Never Again is that the first thirty minutes or so play like a dry run for the recent Bond movie Skyfall, as a rundown James Bond faces suspension and the Double-O program itself faces termination in the wake of political changes. An historical oddity, Never Say Never Again also acts as a weird psychological test -- viewing a James Bond movie without the familiar soundtrack never feels entirely comfortable. That the score for this movie, and the title song, are both unremittingly terrible doesn't help things.s movie, and the title song, are both unremittingly terrible doesn't help things.

B008JFUNYG|3.0|Made with the participation of original (The) Evil Dead writer/director Sam Raimi, this Evil Dead makes some smart changes to the low-budget 1980's horror film that launched the careers of Raimi, his brother Ted, and star Bruce Campbell.<br /><br />The first is to come up with a weirdly plausible new reason for the inevitable trip to a cabin in the woods: four of the five characters are staging an Intervention/Drug DeTox for the fifth, Mia, who appears to have a heroin problem. The second is to alter the tone to one of more seriousness, or at least more angst, for the first two-thirds of the film. The Evil Dead is far less loopy than sequels Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness, but next to this Evil Dead, it looks like a Warner Brothers cartoon.<br /><br />Are there problems? Of course. The addition of a dog to the cast of probably doomed characters goes nowhere, possibly because the filmmakers shied away from graphic violence involving a dog as either victim or perpetrator. The characters are a little shrill at points, though this may be intentional -- certainly, the issues of the various characters are intentional, as is at least one resolution to those issues. The angst tends to overwhelm any attempts at witty or blackly comic dialogue, though. Diablo Cody (Juno) was apparently brought on as a script doctor to add such wit, but it isn't all that apparent what her contributions are.<br /><br />Gore and violence come in increasingly rapid, escalating waves as the film progresses. Nail guns (an homage to Raimi's Darkman?) and electric meat cutters do some terrible stuff. Several characters take levels of physical punishment that would have made Bruce Campbell's Ash proud. If you're going to be a character in an Evil Dead movie, you've got to be able to take a beating and keep on punching back. The film bounces ideas from all three previous installments around, sometimes in newly effective ways, though I wish they'd worked the overwrought tape recording of the archaeologist into something other than the closing credits. I love that guy.<br /><br />Through it all, the Book of the Dead remains indestructible and weirdly attractive to otherwise intelligent characters in search of bathroom reading. Even barbed-wire wrapping and annotated warnings from some previous reader of the tome can't stop the high-school teacher from reading an incantation out loud. Stupid teachers! The filmmakers finally jettison most of the serious dramatic tone for the final twenty minutes, cutting loose in a manner more consistent with the series as a whole. Frankly, it's a relief. And the identity of the survivor or survivors comes as something of a surprise.ist into something other than the closing credits.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|.<br />The Pulitzer Prize is for a book about America and America (Texas) is a very small part of this book.  Once you realize that your main character is in North Korea but the author is commenting about America throughout the book, you will get a lot out of it.  It is not the easiest of reads but is worth the effort, definitely worthwhile for a book club discussion, especially if research is done.  You will learn more about North Korea than you ever wanted to know and there is not really a way to verify what you learn.  The author did a lot of research for your education, about N. Korea and about America.  After book club discussion I needed to read it again, haven't done so yet.  There are lots of dark parts to get through and there are confusing time changes to figure out.  This book is not for everybody but worth the effort, for sure.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|In 2008, the world was introduced to Katy Perry.  Her first major-label album, One of the Boys, was nice little album.  Nothing earth-shatter, in my humble opinion, but it had a few fantastic moments.  Its 2010 follow-up, Teenage Dream, was something else entirely.  That was easily one of the greatest pop albums ever released, and a true force to be reckoned with in the world of mainstream music!  Therefore, Prism had a lot to live up to, and it’s almost not fair to compare it to its older sibling.  With that in mind, let me say that Perry did a fabulous job of making a proper follow-up to that behemoth.  While Teenage Dream was full of sugary pop confections, Prism is much more serious and revealing.  It still has plenty of fun moments though, and when taken in its entirety it’s a record that will stand firmly among Perry’s best work.  Here’s a quasi-rundown by track:<br /><br />ROAR – The album’s first single, and honestly it’s the song that least represents the record as a whole.  I always felt that the song wasn’t quite finished and takes more than a few shortcuts.  Not the strongest Perry single (despite being #1 on the charts), but it’s fun enough.  I’m glad it’s the first song on the record, because after it ends the album really opens up.<br /><br />LEGENDARY LOVERS – Right off, we get into one of the best songs on Prism.  A love song with a Bollywood edge, this is a Katy Perry highlight!  Great production, fantastic vocals, and an awesome breakdown in the middle make for a fantastic song!<br /><br />BIRTHDAY – For some reason, this reminds me of early Mariah Carey.  The more upbeat stuff she did, to be specific.  A sweet little love song, this is very much Katy Perry.<br /><br />WALKING ON AIR – One word: GLORIOUS!  Perry was going for a sound reminiscent of early 90’s CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters…and to say she succeeded is an understatement!  This song is a 90’s deep house love letter, and it wins.  This should be playing at every club at top volume.  It makes me want to jump and dance around my living room!<br /><br />UNCONDITIONALLY – The album’s second single.  It’s got some good production, but in my opinion is not the strongest song on the album.  I personally wouldn’t have picked this as a single.  The chorus soars, but like “Roar” I feel it wasn’t written too well.<br /><br />DARK HORSE – This is a hip-hop number that is easily the album’s weakest moment.  It’s got a repetitive synth backdrop and a grating rap breakdown.  Katy is better than this style of music.<br /><br />THIS IS HOW WE DO – I love this song!  It’s got a great beat and pays homage to care-free partying, a la “Last Friday Night”.  My only grip here is that the song is only just over three minutes long.  This would make a fantastic single.<br /><br />INTERNATIONAL SMILE – Amazing!  Great dance beat and a riveting Daft Punk breakdown in the middle.  Katy shines when she does stuff like this!<br /><br />GHOST, LOVE ME, THIS MOMENT, DOUBLE RAINBOW – I lump these together because this is the segment of the album that loses me every time.  The four songs aren’t bad, and the production is good….they’re just not very memorable at all.  It’s unfortunate, because this is the part where Perry starts getting really personal.  Musically, however, they just happen to be blander than the rest of the record.<br /><br />BY THE GRACE OF GOD – The album closer of the standard edition, this is the album’s most personal moment.  It’s a beautiful ballad, and one of Prism’s strongest tracks.<br /><br />SPIRITUAL – Along with “Walking on Air”, this is one of the album’s best songs.  It’s an ethereal pop track reminiscent of Duran Duran’s slower material.  This really sounds like nothing else on the record, and it’s a shame that only the deluxe edition gets this track.  This should be a single.<br /><br />IT TAKES TWO, CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES – Another two tracks that kind of meld together.  It’s tough to follow-up “Spiritual”, and maybe that’s why the deluxe edition’s closing tracks don’t measure up.  Generic lyrics and average production.<br /><br />While not a constant string of heavy-hitting tracks like Teenage Dream, Prism is still a great album.  Really, there was nowhere else for Perry’s sound to go.  This really is a great follow up, and in many ways it’s superior.  If it weren’t for those few unmemorable tracks that hold it back….
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addicting, but I wish you didn't have to pay or ask friends for help to access levels.  It's also not clear as to how to use extra moves friends send you. I do like seeing where friends are in the game.

B00F2HW20M|5.0|I am torn on this review. I saw Steve Hackett's 'Genesis Revisited' show at Royal Oak, MI this year. The show was amazing. I was happy to see this CD/DVD package being released. I couldn't wait for the set to arrive. The triple CD's sound quality is very good. The interview disc was great as well. As for the show, this was a high quality filmed show. All in all, a great value for the money spent. However, there seems to be a skip on the DVD on the track \\"I Know What I Like\\". I sent it back to Amazon and they promptly sent me another one. The second one is defective as well in the same place. Amazon has offered to refund my money if I return it again. I am worried that this item may end up out of stock since I am having trouble finding it elsewhere. I was curious if anyone else purchased this and had the same problem. This CD/DVD set is too good to not have in my collection. I am debating on whether to keep the one I have and live with the slight glitch or send it back and not be able to get another copy. In my opinion, the set is a solid 5 star rating. If only I had one that was perfect.

B003PBB4ME|4.0|Light weight, very functional -- feels slightly cheaply made (but it is inexpensive after all).<br /><br />I'm on the fence about whether I like the skids (feet) on the bottom.  First off, they don't allow me to install a tripod quick release for either my video or still tripod heads -- even though the retaining thumb screw does have a 1/4-20 threaded hole on it.<br /><br />If you mount a light on the top hot shoe, it does flex quite a bit in the handle -- but I don't see that it would impact performance much.<br /><br />I didn't purchase to do any skateboarding shots --- just wanted an easy way to hand-hold some shots with a light / mic -- meets my needs fine.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Decided to give it a try and now I'm hooked! Downloaded it on my husband's device and now he's addicted too!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|My audiophile friend really likes this model -- he knows WAY more about mics than I do.  He's very pleased with the audio performance and characteristics of the unit.... but I don't know good from great.<br /><br />I just needed an inexpensive lapel mic for some video interviews.  I was pleased with how well it picked up the main interviewer and the person next to them on occasion -- no need to run 2 mics or place the mic in between them surprisingly.<br /><br />The only negative is that the cable seems awfully long.  I guess that's fine -- I would think a shorter cable would be nicer (for me) -- and if needed a longer length, to use an extender cable.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Not sure why there are so many negative reviews unless an entire film critic school decided to single out a movie. Yes its kind of a rehash of the Men In Black movies. But my measure of a movie of this type is, Did I have fun watching the movie? Was I superficially entertained? And the answer is yes. Not every movie needs to be 12 Years a Slave or The Kings Speech. Sometimes you just want a fun and brainless movie and I think this fits the bill just right.
B001BANK32|5.0|Hey, it's King and all that that means.<br /><br /> I reread it in anticipation of Santa bring me Doctor Sleep. Glad I did because I'd forgotten how different it is from the movie. Lots of the iconic scenes in the movie are not in the book but the book has many more of its own. The ending is completely different and I liked both.<br /><br />You definitely get more insight into Danny (the boy) in the book.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00CIAGP4U|4.0|Great imaginative story line - well developed and easy to follow. Begs the question, &#34;Is Creator the ultimate Big Brother&#34;?
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|I have a Lord of the Rings room. I collected dozens of the original Sideshow/Weta collaboration statues. And all of the movie extras, bookends, Gollum, Minas Tirith, even Minas Morgul. This statue is the equal at least of anything before. WETA could offer it as a stand alone and easily charge the $70 for it. Gollum is done very impressively well. He is spot on and amazing expression detail given his size. The Bilbo face is not as well done and is the weak link. But still the clothes and colors are great on Bilbo and the face is acceptable. It is definitely WETA worthy.<br /><br />You also get a box with art so good by my favorite Tolkien artist, Alan Lee, that it is another gift item in and of itself. Charming picture of Gandalf looking down into the Shire and Bag End. Also a picture of Bilbo standing against the white Orc Azog on warg. As far as I know at least that picture is unique to this box set.<br /><br />The 3D is among the best I have seen in a movie rivaling the IMAX 3D discs I have that had been better than movies. I could have gone for 50 minutes more of this movie. But the 13 mins included are delightful. They are some of the more lighthearted scenes: more of Hobbiton, much more of the dwarves having fun in Rivendell, a bit more of the goblin king. It is all seemless and the only downside is you are left wanting more. Each time I watch the Hobbit I like it more. It seems like every lesson learned on the LOTR films was applied here. The acting is top notch and the reviews for this film are, in general, vastly under-rated. It is a more than worthy addition to Jackson's Tolkien work.<br /><br />For those wondering on statue quality it is among the best of the movie inclusions. Perhaps the bookends are next best. And rivals a WETA buy alone product. Gollum is particularly well done, his expression is just fantastic.

B00AGE2HPG|1.0|First, it showed up as a new release for 2013.  Now it is showing the truth, it was released in 1987.  The story line has great potential but the acting was horrible and the movies budget was obviously tight.
B00EEPFRGE|3.0|Just a little humor there..<br /><br />so.<br /><br />I'm the first of the 3 star reviews. Am I also the last?<br /><br />Heaven - I think Revelation could be the greatest Stryper song ever made. It feels like a culmination of everything this band has tried to achieve - in a single song.. that's tough to do.. No More Hell To Pay is the Stryper sound to end all Styper sounds - and it rips - Saved by Love is my favorite song here though - the tempo and where Michael Sweet takes his voice shows why he's practically unequaled in the vocal dept. in all of rock - Jesus is Just Alright is pretty catchy but it overstays its welcome fortunately it has, as most of these songs do an AMAZING guitar solo!!<br /><br />Hell - Let me say if I were to rate this disc on how it ''sounded'' and ''how well the band PLAYED'' it would be a five star album immediately - the problem is - there's more to music than that. The last half of this disc is completely unspectacular as is &#34;the Token Ballad.&#34; Seriously, &#34;The One&#34; is a very boring ballad - but it sounds great! After &#34;Legacy&#34; which is a good to great song - the album slides into fillers-ville and chugga-chugga-land. ''Marching into Battle, Te Amo, Sticks & Stones, Water into Wine, Sympathy'' are virtually all interchangeable...not that they're &#34;bad&#34; they just aren't special and mostly all of them lack any sort of hook.....''Renewed'' comes in to try and save the day but's too late.<br /><br />3.5 stars from me..it's a great sounding album without many memorable tunes.

I love almost all of the songs and know all the lyrics by heart. My husband made fun of me for pre-ordering the album, and laughed how I swooned over the picture of Brian. What can I say, there is nothing BSB could do that wouldn't impress me. I think most BSB fans feel the same way. I love you Brian!

B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was a good but horrible book. Spolier alert if you don't want to know what happens stop reading this now. If tric didn't die the book would be so much better.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This is probably their best work to date! I loved Stryper in the '80's, and No More Hell to Pay does not disappoint. It is current and heavy, yet it stays true to their style. My personal favorites are Marching into Battle, Sympathy, and No More Hell to Pay. Believe the hype. This album rocks!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun game for those who love puzzles! I love the way you have to apply logic to finding out how all the clues work together.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I have seen many apps like this. It is ok but it won't allow me to arrange items into a playlist. I would also appreciate a function that you can turn your screen off and still listen rather than have it exit the video. I do like that I can watch my favorite YouTube videos quickly offline though.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Well written mystery with great locales and quirky and charming characters. Plenty of subplots to keep the reader intrigued. Would recommend this book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I can not get off of it it is so sweet love it.  it is so awesome I keep playing it and playing it until my device is dead.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|It was a good movie. It got to me quickly and was easy to unwrap. I'll be buying from you again.
0385349947|4.0|This book was all over public radio this summer. I decided to give it a shot and it is definitely an inspiring read!
B002XXUWMI|3.0|The movie does not ever rise to it's potential. The disconnect between the premise introduced in the preamble by the Doctor and the actuality of the situation that unfolds is never resolved to my satisfaction.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Said it was good condition when in fact it came in excellent condition!  lt came quickly, well before the final due date and l had just had major surgery and was thrilled to have Castle and Beckett to keep me company!
B005FITIGO|1.0|Just watch the trailer...the glitzy look is about all this flick has going for it.  A zero in terms of plot, suspense, character development, etc.  In fact, even the glitzy trailer was somewhat of a fraud, because the production was strictly low-budget in terms of the number of locations and setups so, ultimately, the visuals became as boring as the thin story.
B006C45CFG|4.0|It is a good movie. Fun to watch, well written, directed and acted.  Worth watching,  but it is not a great movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I only wish that going from one place to the next did not take three days since I do not have Facebook.
B00F031WB8|5.0|THIS DOCUMENTARY IS A GREAT LOOK AT JIMI'S LIFE AND MUSIC.LOTS OF INTERVIEWS BY MUSICIANS,FRIENDS,ETC...THERE ARE CLIPS OF JIMI WITH THE EXPERIENCE,BAND OF GYPSYS,AND OTHER COLLABORATORS WHO JAMMED WITH HIM.THE EXTRAS ARE GREAT,THOUGH THE FOOTAGE/CLARITY/SOUND OF MOST OF THE CONCERTS IS WHAT IT IS.THIS IS ARCHIVAL,HISTORIC PERFORMANCES THAT I'M GLAD TO SEE AND HAVE.THE CONCERTS ARE GREAT AND HAPPENING.HE WAS A GENIUS, WHO WE WERE THANKFUL TO HAVE HAD AS LONG AS WE DID HAVE HIM FOR.HE MADE THE SCENE INTERESTING AND EXCITING.THIS IS A FINE DOCUMENTARY WITH TWO GREAT CONCERTS.I REALLY LIKED IT.
006202406X|5.0|I'm surprised that so many people disliked the ending.  The entire series is based on a distopian society with difficult, life altering decisions made all the time.  Personally I loved the ending.<br /><br />I must admit, at first it took me a a couple of chapters to get back into the groove and I originally found the dual points of view distracting.  But the further I read, the more I appreciated it!  It was fascinating to have Tobias' and Tris' view of things as they happened as well as their reaction to them.  Once I read the ending, this dual perspective really fit perfectly!  It's another huge win for Veronica Roth.  I greatly appreciate that she waited so long to write this.  There is nothing more frustrating than loving a series, waiting impatiently for the next book only to be disappointed that the author clearly rushed it to appease her fans (third Hunger Games book, I'm looking at you!).<br /><br />I plan to reread this entire series as a whole and I think it will be even more satisfying.  Excellent book!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love this!  I love the fact you can print from your phone, to home, from anywhere!!  Truly amazing what you can do with this APP.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This movie is grrreat, a must watch! Nothing like the terribly bad Judge Dredd movie that had Sylvester Stallone in it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Was a gift to my wife for her mmo game play and she very happy with it quality and range. Further she recommends that I get one for myself.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|but this is the second time ive rented this , the First Time is what im rating the Second Time was a Mistake for The Newest one Thor, The Dark World, is what I was trying to rent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't put it down!  You don't know you're attached until you can't walk away!  Great for all ages!  Recommend for everyone.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I'm glad I didn't listen to any of the horrible reviews before I read Allegiant. Oh, and this is my first Amazon review, so forgive me if it's a little long :)<br /><br />In all honesty, all 3 books had their flaws, but the story was captivating. I love this series and feel that this book, although it didn't have the rainbows and butterflies and \\"happily ever after\\" ending that a lot of people wanted, myself included, it did do the series justice. Considering that this was set in a dystopian society and all of the challanges that the characters had faced in the previous book it makes sense for it to go out with this emotional bang.<br />*******MILD SPOILER (maybe)*******<br />I liked the direction Veronica took this book considering the twist at the end of Insurgent. It seemed more believable than having Tris going out and saving the world, or whatever. She kind of gave a twist to the twist if that makes any sense.<br />********************************************<br />Regarding the 2 different POVs from Tris and Tobias, even though it took me a few chapters in to get into it, once I did I felt that it helped me get a better view of their lives and the world they lived in.<br /><br />All in all this series was great and emotionally challenging. Ok, enough blabbering.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love the game but HATE that I have to pay or wait to continue to play.  The 24 hours between quests is just another ploy to make money!  I would rather pay a flat rate for the game.  A total rip off!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|What's all the fuss about this app?  There are a bunch of others almost identical to this one and one is even better.  The others might be copycats, but who cares?
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app dearly, but when I got to my Facebook I couldn't get back to photo editing!!!!!!!!! Now every time I log onto the app it brings me back to the url. If anyone knows how to get out of this problem I will gladly start using this wonderful again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Pleasanrly adicting!!!! I can't seem to get enough. ..even when I'm in the car.  ....so much fun but very adicting.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie! Can't wait to see the next Thor movie. Love these types of movies! A must see for everyone!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Can't go wrong with Pixar films it's just that simple! I have to say I may even like this one better then the first one! My kids and I didn't get to finish the last 30min and it drove me crazy! The anticipation was insane so I found time secretly and finished it! Sullivan has always been my fav I fell in love with him at first sight! Although I miss Boo in this one I mean how can you not she was the cutest little girl character I've ever seen in any animated movies I've ever watched! Maybe they will bring her back in the next movie I hope:). Wow I'm a grown woman and I'm more excited about this film then my kids haha oh well it's the simple things in life.
B0002TJGQS|3.0|It is like any other battery for 2032. Yet it is at a cheaper price!<br />I would buy this again!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son is five, and loves this game. He wants to play it all the time. Glad we got it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game.I tell everyone I know to try it. At the present I am in a race with my kids.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Have this bad boy hooked onto my 4670k and I am in the 30-40 deg C for days. Keeps it so cool, and it can barely be heard over room noise.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|this app only gave us three puzzles. and showed us a great deal of locked puzzles but no option to buy or unlock.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Those is a great game because it just great I don't know how to say is but is great and I hope you think so to
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It sucks it can't update without u going to google play and when u go to the Appstore on the kindle it just says open not update there is no doubt it sucks
B0047SHEAK|3.0|Was okay,<br /><br />  wasn't too fond of how the movie began.  People are just falling out of the sky.  Didn't care much for the story line.  Still think the original is the best.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|This is a very, very silly film.  It's also a very gory film.  Alcohol was imbibed and I did watch it all the way through.  Alan Tyduk was a hoot, as expected.  Four stars.  Joe-Bob says &#34;check it out&#34;.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Another great Denzel movie. I always watch his movies and have never been disappointed. A great ending I didn't think would happen.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|The best weather widget available. One of my screens is devoted to the clock widget, which lets me see in an instant what the weather will be for the next twelve hours. I did get this as a Free App of the Day, but I would definitely pay for it--one of very few apps about which I can say that.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Fabulous album that I regret missing for so many years. I think I will wear it out before too long. Nice to discover such great music that has always been right under my nose.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Who can't love this movie?  Its just beyond silly and the actual timeline just makes you wonder.  They seem to have internet access yet dress like they're in the 70's.  They have music from the early 90's.  Its just the kind of movie you can watch over and over.  The extra features were kinda nice.  Outtakes from certain scenes were interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. I love playing against my Facebook friends. It's great when u beat a friends high score. Can't wait to see if there will be a sequel.
0307120007|4.0|Gave this book as a baby shower gift, among other gifts and it was well received.  My girlfriend read it as a child and highly recommended it.  It was packaged nice in a little box with clear wrap so it wraps up nice if its to be bought as a gift.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I haven't been playing for long but I am already hooked. I can't wait to see what comes next. I really enjoy playing shipwrecked island too but like any of these games, you have to spend real money to continue. Some of these games are worth it if you look at them like any other arcade games. You pay to play those, right?
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love these adventures of these brothers.  I prefer the story lines where they are not fighting the universal evil dimensions, but that they are dealing with individual demons.
0440245915|2.0|Not a very interesting thriller. I need to be interested right away or else I just don't put in the effort to get to the interesting bits.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|Glee is total escapism.  If you are looking for reality or something to teach you lessons of life, Glee is probably not for you.  But if you want to escape into another world, another dimension (like science fiction), relax and enjoy the exploits of Glee.
1572814136|5.0|I like the size of the cards and the graphics. However, I did not expect to find a thin instructions book. From what I gather, each person interprets each card according to how he/she sees/feels each card.  You can always purchase a new instructions book that you undertand and like.
193700788X|5.0|I loved this story. I don't know how people could complain.  It was a classic Sookie story. The only thing I am sad about is that it is the last. I will miss reading about Sam, Sookie, Bill, Tara, Pam and the rest of the crew.  Great job Ms. Harris!!!!!!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem is back! Love this album. Especially the deluxe edition. Rap god forever. Worth every dollar. Don't understand why some people hate it.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like reading a book in the format of letters but after a few letters I was hooked.  I found myself going back to the top of the letter to keep track of who was writing and to whom.  I didn't want the story to end.  I even liked the letters by the characters that I didn't like.  It made me want to learn more about the time frame, the island and the people who lived there.  I was terribly disappointed as I got to the end of this well written story to realize that there would be no others by this author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read several Steven King books and this one was a very pleasent surprise.  It was hard to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is fun game with cute sound effects and graphics. But you need to buy \\"lives\\" or be forced wait 30 minutes if you fail to complete a level in 5 attempts. Which happens more and more often as you progress in the game.  I found this very annoying. So unless you are a very patient person l would pass on this one. Because there is a vast array of games available without this type of restriction.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Everything is awesome except 2 things. 1, which I have the biggest problem with, is that the suits are to expensive. The other thing is that you don't get diamonds that often.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a great story about a girl's love of nature and wanting to ensure it survives.  It is also about a father who wants his child to survive as well as the animals.  They go to great lengths to protect a flock of geese.  Great movie for the entire family.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really enjoy puzzles of all kinds but this one brings back so many great memories of times spent with family . Love the scenic and seasons puzzles the best . Question or thought, is there any way to lock down the puzzle so that when your working on it, it doesn't move off the mat . Lost one already and can't get it back . Thank you
159448385X|5.0|This is a fabulous book that captures the reader's attention for the beginning and displays the reality of living amidst constantly changing governments. It has opened my eyes to the Afghanistan culture beyond that of what I see on the news.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I liked almost every song. She sings with heart and talent. Except for &#34;4x4&#34; and &#34;love,money,party&#34;. Just thug and pointless.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|I really like this great free app. Warned me to get rid of 3 things I had put on my phone, I feel much safer with it installed.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|The acting was terrible.  Although the plot premise was OK, what they specifically did with the plot was stupid.  Basically an excuse to show off special effects.
B00BSBVJVE|4.0|I love Pusheen so I immediately preordered the book. When it arrived yesterday, I was a bit disappointed to find that it included very little (if any) new content. I flipped through the entire thing in five minutes.<br /><br />The only purpose I could really see in buying this book were if you were to give it to a child (the littlest of babies). For anyone else, just visit the tumblr (which has animated gifs too).<br /><br />For me, the purchase was more about supporting the artist, but I think I probably could have done better by just sending her $10 directly.
0446582778|5.0|taut very-well written story from the beginning., excellently read by the reader. I couldn't wait to get into the car for the next chapter. Kudos to Michael Connelly.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Loved seeing this again with Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. Enjoyed every minute of it. A classic for sure!
0143122061|4.0|Tour de force for Mr. Ferguson. Lots of enjoyment listening to Mr. F. read his own book on the CD version (does many accents quite well, some not so much), often good insights and certainly a global reach. Worthwhile.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|It's all about the characters and whether or not I want to spend what little &#34;spare time&#34; I have with them. these are definitely worth it. I really like how they are growing through the seasons.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This was recommended by a friend,  and for some reason caught my interest.  It made a lot of sense so I started following it.  I lost weight, I have more energy, but I'm still waiting for my arthrightis pain to subside.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Love this game.....better than Angry Birds.  Grandkids LOVE it also.  Keeps them busy ..... well worth the price.  The graphics are great also.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|this review is made on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 4.5 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 . 5<br /><br />great blu ray , demo quality all the way.<br />have you cheering all out for turbo.<br />highly recommended.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|40 years. ago I first heard of the white album hunted it down and bought it . I was so dissapointed I left it in a corner for several months then one day I said to myself I would give it a chance so I sat down and listened to it carefully at that point I realized I was not the Beatles I was listening to but a combination of John,George,Paul & ringo showing what was to come on their solo work or first albums next thing I know it was becoming one of my favorite Beatle albums today I have it on cd,cassette and vinyl and on my way to buy a sealed one to leave for my daughter this lp is not meant for any other type of format but vinyl and on a good system so if you have a choice don't get the cd or the excessive hissing cassette
1623650003|4.0|This is good mystery novel, but definitely not one for the faint of heart. The opening part of the novel involving the kidnapping of the eponymous character, Alex, is both gripping and disturbing. Overall this is a quite good novel. The story was well paced and there were enough believable twists and turns to keep you interested. The character of Alex was intriguing and one of the better subjects of a crime novel I have read about in quite awhile. This is a novel that will stick with you which is why I rated this as highly as I did.<br />The reason for not getting 5 stars is that I disliked the lead detective. He was really the only character I didn't care to read more about. He did not come off as being nearly as impressive as I think the author intended him to be. A crime novel normally lives and dies by the lead detective, but there was enough going on throughout the novel that allowed this story to overcome that limitation. The secondary characters were fun and surprisingly well fleshed out for the amount of ink they received. I get the sense this could be the start of a series and hope to hear more about them in the future.<br />One cultural anecdote that will stick with me is that when describing how hard the police were working the author tells us that the police were putting in 10 hour days. As an American a 10 hour day isn't all that impressive (I do it 5 days a week), but apparently for the French this is going above and beyond.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Drivel, very disappointing from the author of Pillars Of The Earth.  Not worth reading.<br />Sorry I spent money on this stunningly bad book.  I had thought of Ken Follett as a reasonably decent writer. I'm shocked at his infantile portrayal of characters, as well as miserable verbiage. He should be ashamed of himself for allowing this book to be published.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|One of the most artful documentaries I've seen. A must for every sushi lover. Jiro brings art to sushi and reveals the dedication to his profession.
B00000633N|5.0|New product, cd is fantastic!!  Exactly what I wanted and enjoy!  I'm planning on ordering a lot more cd's this way for sure, Kudos!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Enjoyed this movie, again. Looking forward to Catching Fire. If you haven't seen this yet, it's worth watching. A+ rating.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|love google anything you need you can find. explains all information you need to know about. I use  it everyday
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|You are either going to like this movie or hate it...no in between.  Probably would not say it is great but I thought it was actually pretty cool.  At least 3.5 stars and I gave it 4.  I also came in with low expectations because I read so many bad reviews for it.  Regardless, I thought the sci-fi and special effects were cool.  I also liked the whole father/son thing.
0451232577|4.0|I really enjoy historical fiction and Ken Follett does it well.  This book gave information on the events and politics leading up to the first world war in a way that was easily understood.  He gives great depth to his characters and makes us care about them.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Wow, I just finished this book and couldn't wait to review it.  First of all, I was near the end last night and stayed up half the night because I couldn't stop myself.  I'm a person who is asleep by 9:00PM without fail so that alone is pretty amazing.  Not only was this a fantastic drama but it was a beautiful love story that was action packed as well.  I think what sucks you into it is that we all have a fantasy at some time or another about changing something from the past whether it is our own or the world's.  You never think of all it would take to do it or the consequences.  This book will make you think about this subject in a profound way.  Ultimately, this book is a long read but it doesn't once feel like it.  As a matter of fact, I'm disappointed that it ended.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is one of my favorite of all time! I can play for hours on end. The game play is amazing and the graphics are spot on! So much fun. Definitely worth the money and then some.
0486295559|5.0|I bought this because I'm doing a project on Persuasion and I wanted a cheap copy that wasn't the one that is near and dear to my heart to make marks and notes in and such, so this was perfect for that. It's as fine an edition of Persuasion as any...I never read those introduction/notes bits in the standard editions anyway.<br /><br />About the actual book, Persuasion is one of my favorite Austens...Wentworth is the only Austen hero I actually crushed on growing up. I mean, I love Mr. Darcy, but that is more of an object love, an observation of his general greatness as a romantic hero and the perfection of Lizzy and him as a couple....but Wentworth did it for me, personally, haha.
0740748475|5.0|Absolutely the best compilation of the most hilarious two characters ever to make the funny pages. Calvin could have lived on my block when I was growing up in the 1950's. In fact, I think he did and in my house. I can truly identify with him.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|A profound, provoking film that considers the intelligence of the audience as an element of good story telling. Each facet of these converging and diverging stories has purpose. This purpose is alluded to throughout the film and becomes it's own character along with the music and the underling  message. This is a film that only gets better the more it is watched and understood. It speaks of purpose, potential, strength, weakness and how each person posses all the traits all the time.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Great when you have 3 to 5 free minutes to workout. You can make time for this and you feel it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a very entertaining game. Its a great way to kill time. Especially when you have some waiting to do such as waiting on a bus or riding the train.
0756407915|4.0|I recently just finished this book.  It was more or less a labor of love.  Clearly, it is not a short read, although it does read pretty easily, but at over 1100 pages you should be ready to invest some time into it.  Also, it wastes little to no time picking up where the previous entry left off so if you haven't read The Name of the Wind or forgot most of the story, refresh your memory beforehand.  As for the story... it is okay.  I would define this book in its entirety as one giant conglomeration of several tangential and anecdotal accounts of seemingly random things that happen to Kvothe during his young adulthood.  Almost none of it drives the plot forward, what little of it there is.  And if you do not take into account the devices introduced in The Name of the Wind, there is literally no plot in this story at all.  It's kind of a bunch of shorter stories mashed together that do nothing to advance the core of the story.  No questions you had will be answered... none.  That being said, I still enjoyed the book.  Rothfuss has a way of storytelling that is both punctual and elaborate.  The pace is fast enough to stay interesting but slow enough to really get a feel for the environment of the story and characters.  The only thing that struck me as strange was the super random point where Kvothe just starts banging every girl he meets.  Sounds like I'm joking but I'm not.  It just seemed sooo out of place and just plain weird.  Not sure what prompted Rothfuss to make that decision or not cut it out in editing but it definitely does not fit at all with the rest of the story.<br />Anyways, for all of the negativity in this review, I should say that I still think this is a fantastic book.  It's different for sure, and may not sit well with some readers because of the way it moves forward (or remains stationary as it were) but I enjoyed just about all of it and have come to enjoy the multifaceted adventures that Kvothe embarks upon.  Plain and simple, if you enjoyed The Name of the Wind, do yourself a favor and visit Kvothe and company  again!
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book. Such intelligent, enthralling writing. Elizabeth Gilbert has an incredible grasp of her subject matter and of human nature. The storyline took so many unexpected twists and turns I was continually in rapture of where I as reader was being taken. What a unique story and beautifully told.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG! This game is so freaking addictive! I see why everyone is raving about it. I cannot put it down. I have even starting to play during lunch instead of eating. I love it! I yell when I get through a level. So much fun! Thanks Amazon for adding this one.
0316017930|3.0|Perhaps the main problem with the book is its use of the word 'outliers' to refer to exceptional people, individuals who achieve so much more than others. It should instead refer to the exceptional circumstances that allowed them their meteoric rise to success. These factors - such as year and era of birth, family background, race and place of education - contain the quirks of fate that allow the merely talented to achieve the successes that lie so far outside the norm. This is Gladwell's major thesis.<br /><br />Gladwell's target is the traditional American story of success: rugged individuals, by dint of hard work and raw talent - perspiration and inspiration - achieve those magnificent success levels that elude others. Instead, Gladwell wants to show the place of circumstances and situation in this story. He wants to give success a context beyond that of one man and his willpower. Fair enough.<br /><br />In order to do this, Gladwell tells some stories of his own. Lots of them, in fact. The book is one, big collection of counter-cultural stories about the nature of specifically American success. By 'counter-cultural' I mean contrary to the 'rugged individual' myth described above. This story-method is Gladwell's greatest strength or weakness, depending of what you're looking for. Me, I wanted to read something fascinating, provocative, and launch-pad like. That's exactly what I got.<br /><br />Most of Gladwell's detractors find his method of extreme induction - \\"Here's one case so that means there's a pattern\\" - infuriating. I find in fun. When I read a Gladwell book, I'm not on the lookout for rigorous sampling methods or objective self-criticism. Let's leave that to university textbooks, can't we? Gladwell does pop journalism with ideas and trends. He's a beginning, a warm-up guy, a threshold-guardian of atypical info. You don't need to take him more seriously than that.<br /><br />That said, my lingering sense after finishing the book was one of anticlimax. OK, so now we know that as well as talent and effort, success also requires of us a massive amount of good fortune and opportunity. So what exactly can I do about it? Beyond vague pleas for someone - Big government? The education system? - to take this wider context into account, there's not much we as individuals can do about it.<br /><br />Or maybe there there is. Throughout the book Gladwell does flag up a couple of possibilities. He just doesn't do too much with them, that's all. That's what frustrated me the most with the book.<br /><br />For instance, Gladwell spends some time taking the IQ industry to task. He points out some examples of people with incredibly high IQ levels who haven't made been successful. So far, so trite. Gladwell sexes up this observation by juicy piece of compare and contrast (chapter 4). In one corner, entre Chris Langan, in IQ terms a genius, but in success terms a flop. In the other corner, there's J Robert Oppenheimer, theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project. The difference? Oppenheimer had charm, excellent communication skills, and 'social knowledge'. And where did this come from? His comfortable, suburban, upper-middle class background.<br /><br />It's here that I want to scream. My mind is shouting, \\"Write about emotional intelligence! Tell them that social skills and communication can be learned! Mention Howard Gardner, or at least Daniel Goleman!\\" But no. Instead, we get one footnote, two sentences, about the work of Robert Sternberg (p. 290). Way to go, Malcolm. Not. Here's a prime chance to sow the seeds of personal development, but instead you pour on the cement of social conditioning and class consciousness. Again, nothing for us to do.<br /><br />Another example is Gladwell's handling of the 10,000 hour rule (chapter 2), formulated by Dr. K. Anders Ericsson. According to this rule, 10,000 hours is the amount of practise required before a human being can lay claim to mastery or expertise in an activity. Even if you're a genius like Mozart, you still have to pump in those hours. Gladwell illustrates this rule with the Beatles (performing together) and Bill Gates (programming).<br /><br />Only problem is, he then goes on to describe how a very specific and unique set of circumstances allowed them to notch up those hours, factors that Joe Bloggs public - that's you and me, folks - just couldn't contrive. Still, it made me wonder whether I've chalked up anything near 10,000 hours honing a particular skill. The best I could come up with was reading. Does that count?<br /><br />Anyway, I give the book three out of five stars for entertainment value, quality of journalism, mental stimulation, and idea-gathering. For my taste, there's a little too much, 'me, me, me' in Outliers; Gladwell needs to untangle his brain from his own hype. But his main problem is that the book is discouraging, leavening us little to do beyond wonder if we were born on the wrong time and place to achieve a level of success that lies outside the mean.<br /><br />Outliers is a book of pretty analysis, that's for sure. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do with it. And for a book about success, that's a pretty tragic flaw.

0385528752|3.0|This quote from Albert Einstein haunts my evaluation of Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard by Chip & Dan Heath, those Miliband brothers of the business world. Switch is a simple book. It is based on a simile - the emotional part of the mind is like an elephant, the rational part is like its rider, and getting them to work together requires roadwork. That's it, really.<br /><br />So is this simple, or simplistic? Have they provided a structure for individual and corporate change that is easy to apply and powerful in it effects, with all unnecessary verbiage and overkill stripped away? Or is it a nice little story - borrowed from someone else - with a swamp of other, lesser stories engineered in to fill out some space?<br /><br />This book made me think, which is always a plus. Switch's often repeated mantra that 'people problems are really situation problems' (3, 183) challenged my own view of the nature of change considerably. It also serves to explain the authors' suspicion of personality testing and analysis as a change mechanism (114 with note, 252, 258). Their main thesis seems to be that managing change is not a matter of reason or emotion but environment, not inner working (which are hard to influence) but the outer world (which is easier).<br /><br />This environmental emphasis is further reinforced by their (research justified) assertions that 'willpower is not enough' (10) and 'knowledge is not enough' (30, 35, 109, 112, 175). In particular, the notion that increased information can easily lead to change gets a real kicking in Switch; knowledge without change is TBU - True But Useless (71). Rather, emotions are the key (105), or rather motivation as managed through tweaking your situation. To diagnose failure to change as a personal issue rather than a situational one is to commit the 'fundamental attribution error' (180 with note).<br /><br />The authors are convincing when they analyse the problems of 'analysis paralysis' (33, 72) and 'decision paralysis' (50) inherent with reliance on reason ('the rider') alone. I enjoyed learning about BHAG's (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals - 75) and Black-and-White Goals (86), as well as the SEE-FEEL-CHANGE method of persuasion (106). I wanted to know more about the identity model of decision-making (153), the management technique of 'appreciative enquiry' (48 with note), and the theory of 'small wins' (136). I was glad to recognise the inclusion of key psychologists whose ideas have much to say to the world of work, such as Martin Seligman (121), Ellen Langer (124), Albert Bandura (129 with note) and Carol Dweck (164).<br /><br />Most of the good stuff quoted above comes from the middle and strongest section of the book, 'Motivate the Elephant'. The authors had just done a great job of convincing you that the rider (reason) needs directing; this takes the first third of Switch. But it is in the crucial final section - 'Shape the Path' - that the books weaknesses emerge. Which are? Too much repetition of previously stated points. An over-use of illustrative, folksy stories with dubious immediate relevance. And suggested solutions that border on the childish e.g. checklists (220).<br /><br />There also seems to me to be some basic points of tension in the message of Switch. We're told to give ourselves big, bold goals...but 'lower the bar' (130) and seek small victories. We're told to 'script' all our moves...but then leave the middle part of the journey to take care of itself (93). Perhaps this fuzziness is inevitable when you use metaphors to explain similes!<br /><br />I'll take away from Switch the basic triadic model for change it promotes, as well as a newfound appreciation for the situational element in creating change. Reading Switch has also left me with a douzen-or-so different articles, concepts and thinkers to research. (Sometimes the references in the notes were the book's best bits.) And I'm persuaded by it that the usual mixture of information and perspiration - new facts and/or more willpower - are not sufficient or even the primary tools in our quest for improvement.<br /><br />So, Switch, simple or simplistic? Simplistic, I'm afraid. However, Switch did provide enough additions and challenges to my current thinking about change to balance out its flaws a little. I would recommend Switch for those who want a self-help book but aren't familiar with the wider literature. As a business book, Switch's value might reflect the reader's prior knowledge of what to look out for. There are nuggets in the notes. The rest is a one-time read.
B006MPKE9O|4.0|Such a super book! It was interesting, funny and clever all in one. Great characters and was a little different from the usual read.
0345472322|3.0|Despite the three star evaluation, do not underestimate the quality of the central thesis of this book. The idea that there are two mindsets - fixed and growth - and that these mindsets are basic in determining many things about success and happiness in life, is incontrovertible, radical, and perception shifting. Dweck has based the book on a bedrock of sound, academic research. She has applied it to several key spheres of life. She has witnessed its power to change lives.<br /><br />What's the problem then? The problem is this book and how it is written; specifically, Dweck underestimates her audience's ability to handle the strong stuff. Instead of explication and application, we are treated to story after story, anecdote upon anecdote, and imaginary dialogues with non-existent people. I'm by nature a careful reader but I found myself flicking, scanning and otherwise anxious to get it finished. That's what I usually do when I read the psychology section of a magazine.<br /><br />And the worst about it is, Dweck has so much of depth and detail to say. I suspect that she has said it in her more academic book on the same subject, 'Self-Theories: Their Role in Motivation, Personality and Development'. I suspect, further, that someone convinced her of the need to write a popular account of findings, dumbed down for us plebs. Perhaps this is slightly unfair; Dweck's passion for facilitating positive change in people's lives does shine through. But I needed less motivational patter, more on her theory of motivation. I'm a big boy, I can take it.<br /><br />What frustrated me the most were the hints in her book of the workshops and training sessions she has supervised in order to help people grow a growth mindset (140-141 and 218-220). I wanted details, details, details. Instead, there were brief overviews, references to techniques without the possibility of follow-up, and dead ends. But surely this should be the very hub of the book. The concept of 'how to' might seem beneath the purview of lofty academics but for the average buyer of this book I'm guessing this is almost all of what is required. A large chunk of other reviewers seem to agree.<br /><br />As well as more detail on use and how-to, I'd have appreciated some thought from the other end of the spectrum. What I mean is, if true, I think Dweck's theory constitutes a deep interpretation of human nature. She does recognise that mindsets run at a more basic level than the techniques and approaches of therapies such as CBT or REBT (216). Maybe I'm over-doing it, but I kept thinking of the debates in pre-Socratic philosophy between the worldviews of being and becoming, Parmenides versus Heraclitus. It also minded me of debates about personal identity and persistence over time i.e. whether personality is fixed, in flux or a fiction. One reason why I rate Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi`s 'flow' concept so highly is because he interacts with it on all these levels.<br /><br />A few other little points niggled me. Dweck's excursus into business ethics was an exercise in naivety (esp. 118). Her habit of taking every businessperson, every sports star, every relationship issue, and using it to illustrate her fixed/growth dichotomy seemed stretched to me. And an academic writer who feels the need to quote Malcolm Gladwell as one of her prime sources is surely getting things the wrong way round (40, 90, 108-9).<br /><br />Dweck's fundamental thesis will stay with me. Her stories will not. Her method lies elsewhere. So, probably, should your money.

1594484805|5.0|Pink's 2005 book A Whole New Mind redefined the business/psychology genre of self-help-type literature. It did this, not so much by its content, as by its shape and style. Drive continues this trend, only more so.<br /><br />Yes, the content of both books is first class. Pink shows incredible ability gathering together disparate strands of information - news stories, academic research, cultural trends, web materials, business speeches - and weaving them together into a convincing narrative. But the likes of Malcolm Gladwell do the same. How Pink exceeds his competitors is twofold. (1) He possess a taxonomists skill in grouping large chunks of data together in ways that seem to throws light on historical patterns. (2) He isn't interested in merely tickling our fancies; he wants us to go forth and do something with this new knowledge.<br /><br />Hence, in A Whole New Mind, after explaining each of his six right-brain senses, he spends time teaching us how to grow or apply the skills discussed. And so with Drive. Only, this time, he spends the last third book on this type of material. The first third lays down the background and theory. This is where Gladwell stops, minus the coherence and classifications. The second third focuses on the main three motivations skill of autonomy, mastery and purpose. This is where Chip and Dan Heath get to on a good day. But Pink is only warming up.<br /><br />Part Three of Drive consists of \\"The Type I Toolkit\\" where type I means those with internal motivation as opposed to external 'carrot and stick' motivation (type x). There are eleven subsections here, including a brilliant recap of and glossary for the whole book. There is a reading list and a guru list for further research. And there are other lists of ways to apply the book's thinking to areas are diverse but vital as individual and group motivation, paying your employees, raising your kids, and getting/keeping yourself fit.<br /><br />There are plenty of blurbs and reviews thatfocus on the specifics of Drive's content, so I needn't regurgitate them. All I can say that as a training consultant and business book club founder, I'm familiar with literature on motivation. This is the best out there, bar none. Pink always manages to unearth material that is new, exciting and relevant. And let's not neglect that fact that Pink has good stuff to say in his own right. Less so than A Whole New Mind, you're still getting a bit of the author's own thinking in Drive, minus the navel-gazing Gladwell displayed in Outliers.<br /><br />Pink mentions Gladwell on page 190. Such a first-rate writer, and so generous with it...
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|I wouldn't call the objects in this game so much hidden as just part of a very cluttered scene, but the basic goal of the game is to find specific objects as quickly as possible before time runs out.  There are several modes to this game.  You can find objects based on pictures of the objects, outlines of the objects, or the written names of the objects.  Sometimes, there are added challenges, like stopping bombs that appear at random locations while you're looking for other objects.  At each phase of the game, players are offered a choice of three different modes to play through.  You can play the same phase of the game over again in a different mode, if you like.  There are also extra bonus levels that you can unlock.  The background scenes are sort of Halloween themed, like old houses and graveyards.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the game was that some of the objects are small and difficult to see, but it is possible to zoom in and out of scene, and that helps.
0307463745|4.0|Although there is no 'system' to Rethink, there is a method and a style. The method is to take no sacred cow or status quo for granted but to put all to a thoroughly pragmatic test. The style is to whittle each point down to a bare minimum and then rush on to the next. Rework is about bite rather than depth, practice rather than theory. But it would be wrong to place it in a motivational mould, neither is there one overriding motif beyond a challenging of orthodoxies in a fresh and positive way. Unless you count a love of leanness as a theme.<br /><br />I liked it for two reasons. Firstly, it contains some insights that I thought but didn't have the confidence to say or try. After all, I don't have an MBA, so what could I know? For instance, under 'Hiring', the authors decry the worth of resumes and the usefulness of anything over six months of experience. Also, in 'Takedowns', I always suspected that learning from failure is overrated, planning is a synonym for guessing, and working yourself to death is dumb on so many levels.<br /><br />Second, it filled my mind with a ton of fresh little experiments to try out in my own business. I especially found this to be the case under 'Competitors' (\\"decommoditize\\" or personalise your produce making copying impossible, and \\"pick a fight\\" with a big boy in order to contrast yourself with it and make a splash) and 'Promotion' (give away a little free stuff, build an audience not just a cliental, and, most brilliantly, \\"out-teach your competition\\" to establish your expertise and trustworthiness). For me, as a trainer, this last point sunk home.<br /><br />There was an interesting and surprising emphasis on the power of writing through the book. For instance, they contrast optimal business writing with formal or academic writing (216). A criterion for hiring a quality employee, all else being equal, is the standard of their writing; it is a sign of clear thinking and empathy (222). When writing, sound like yourself, not some wannabe lawyer or corporate robot (263); this sort of everyday behaviour will create the right culture from the bottom up.<br /><br />I would say that Rework is an ideal read for entrepreneurs (especially new starts), the self-employed and owners of SMEs. Those who work FOR someone rather than ON their own enterprise might find it a little shallow or all-too-easy sounding. Even then, the chapters on 'Productivity' and 'Damage Control' are applicable to any workplace. For those of us in the entrepreneurial (oops - 28) trenches it's a tonic; while not quite a tool box, it's certainly a box of tactics, tricks and twists on SOPs that make you want to experiment immediately. It may even shake up the thinking of some old campaigners out there.<br /><br />Yes, it is thin on detail. Yes, some of the pics seem designed merely as space fillers. (A quirky but relevant diagram for each point would have served far better.) I found myself disappointed at the 'Resources' section, which was just a couple of lists about the authors' business and products. But as a call to action, experimentation and the overturn of many business clichés and customs, I found it highly valuable. I will be reading it and using it again. There's hardly a better recommendation than that.

I am aware of the whole story behind the band being upset with the mix (and the quest to find the masters) I can ONLY reccomend this for the bonus tracks and the Live disc. If you want the live disc BUY IT. There is NO doubt that the actual album sounds worse in this DELUXE vesion.

She prefers reading this book to watching a TV show before bed which is great!<br /><br />As far as the book goes, the story concept is unique and the illustrations are excellent. If I had any complaints I would wish there were a few more pages I think it could have used some content between the crayons complaints and the resolution of the story, maybe it could have explored the process of thinking about and solving the problems at hand.<br /><br />I'd like to see the author and artist team up again, this was a good effort, but I suspect they can do even better.

0316247545|5.0|This book is definitely a good guide to the series, with summaries of each episode so far and the letters Twilight Sparkle and her friends have sent to Princess Celestia, mane 6 profiles and even nods to fans for background ponies, ex. calling the famous pony that looks like the Doctor from Doctor Who \\"Dr. Hooves,\\" a nod to the popular fan-name \\"Doctor Whooves.\\" There is also an exclusive interview with Lauren Faust, concept art, and quotes from the crew of the show and Hasbro Studios. Throughout the book, crew share their stories in little bubbles of color scattered across the pages and parallel to the pages that announce a new chapter. One such story is the producer Devon Cody's tale about how he saw a person dressed in a Pinkie Pie costume in Austin in 110 degree heat. \\"Now that's dedication!\\" he concludes.<br />In the beginning of the book, in comic form, is the story of how Princess Luna became Nightmare Moon, and on the inside of the cover on both the back and the front are quotes from the show.<br />This is a very good book for fans if they want to go inside the show in depth and see what goes on behind the animation. All in all this is a great guide to the show and you will not be disappointed.<br />One thing that is not correct is the color of the Elements of Harmony: in chapter 5, \\"The Elements of Harmony,\\" the colors of the gems are correct EXCEPT for one: there is a green element in there! I do not recall a green element in the show, but this is a minor error that does not take away greatly from the book. This is actually a very well done book, complete with glossy pages and hardcover, well, covers. Fans, your prayers have been answered!

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Completely blown out of the water by the quality of every single track on this album.<br /><br />So much of Marshall Mathers on this album, less cocky but more real retracing his past<br />and all his emotions intertwined.  I can't stop listening to this every time I listen I get a new<br />piece of the album... rich with subtle and clever wordplay Eminem doesn't miss a single step<br />on this album.<br /><br />It does't have the same &#34;raw&#34; feelings of his early albums but somehow he gets across a<br />message of &#34;I am matured but still giving a middle finger to anyone who hates it&#34;.<br /><br />I'd recommend this album to anyone absolutely anyone.

B00DBISUWS|5.0|&#34;Tales of Us&#34; is very different from the elector-pulsating albums many Goldfrapp fans are likely most familiar with. This isn't a dance party: it's a collection of moody, hypnotic, entrancing tracks that are hauntingly beautiful and mysterious. Goldfrapp constantly reinvents itself, and this might be the group's darkest album to date: and it's amazing. Love, love, LOVE it!
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|Although the special effects are not the greatest, the story does have a kind of plot, and the characters are interesting while they last (most are killed off, one by one).  Vin Diesel is not invincible in this movie  (his jailer bests him twice in minor combat);  in many ways this movie is very similar to the newest Riddick movie (very similar plots with some scary monsters on an inhospitable planet where darkness is not your friend.

B00ERIUO02|4.0|Truth be told, I wasn't the biggest Katy Perry fan until &#34;PRISM&#34; came out. Sure, she has some fun bubble-gum pop hits like &#34;Teenage Dream&#34; and &#34;I Kissed a Girl,&#34; but was there really anything of substance there? Then I listened to her new album in its entirety, and that made me a Katycat. Truly, &#34;PRISM&#34; is an awesome album that showcases Perry's range as an artist, which I didn't know existed before now. There's the power anthem &#34;Roar,&#34; which took a while to grow on me but finally did. I also really like the ballad &#34;Unconditionally,&#34; the dance-infused &#34;Walking on Air,&#34; the surprising hip-hop heavy &#34;Dark Horse,&#34; and &#34;Grace of God,&#34; which is a beautiful and vulnerable song about surviving a broken heart. There are still a couple of songs on here that make me roll my eyes (&#34;Birthday?&#34; seriously?), but all in all, this is a fun album which showcases a more mature Perry. And I like it.

B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Could be one of the best book of 2013. Even though I disagree (though I pause when I update Instagram) and will keep using Social Media, it still was a great concept and warning about where we are going. Most importantly it was a page turner. When you can have something entertaining with a cool premise and message I am a happy reader. Eggers shows he still has the stuff.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Angry Birds-Star Wars is a very good version of the Angry Birds theme games. I like the idea of having various characters instead of just various bird types being used to eliminate Pigs, levels also seem to be more challenging.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|An incredible tale of a family's struggle to survive and flourish just before and during World War 1.  Mostly set in Vienna, a cultural meltingpot of its time.  Sebastian drew me in from the very beginning and wouldn't let go,  from the very beginning when the poor youth had to have his leg amputated all the way to the end of the book.  This isn't just Sebastian's story though, but the story of his family, their friends, and his country's struggle to get through the war.  It is about life, death,  friendship, sacrifice, and love.  While reading this story,  it was almost as if I had been transported back in time and could see events unfold, and feel what the members of the Schreiber family was feeling.  I easily rate this book at 5 stars, and only wish I were allowed to give it more stars.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Is a great game for children or adults. Directions are easy to follow and once you learn how to place objects to build reef so that it is easy to collect points/money the game itself is quite enjoyable.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Even though it was difficult to come back to occasionally (Amsterdam), the story moved forward to a logical, meaningful conclusion. Almost all of the characters were well drawn as mixtures of dark and light. The prose was highly polished yet felt as though it spilled from the author's mind in one sitting, which is truly remarkable. A wonderful two week read.<br /><br />Note: The crux of the biscuit is, of course, the apostrophe! A memorable Frank Zappa song made great by the extraordinary bassist Jack Bruce.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This is a good game, however I do have a version that installed on home computer that is better as bubbles on that build and move down so you have to be quicker at eliminating them.

B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|The levels are somewhat difficult with the magnets - hard to tell how to complete. Would like more instructions on some of the attributes of the birds, don't understand all of them.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|This is a very good version of the game, and the two player option is good. The only draw back to game is that only have just the one type of bowler, i have option that bought online for computer that has option of several different type of bowlers and is more entertaining for children.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This software has a wide array of useful applications. I use it mainly for its mathematical module. It has a good and clear menu, with examples that show how to use it. Great buy.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a much better version without the ads and plays better than the other version offered with ads. Even though games are the same it plays much smoother.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I remember seeing the TV series as a kid, thought it was funny. This movie is great from beginning to end, I Love Johnny Depp as the lead role. I would recommend this movie to others, especially if you saw the TV version.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Enjoy using google for many searches, think it is a wonderful tool. Basically loaded onto tablet so that do not have to be on PC anytime need to use it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't want to read any more of this kind, too much trash.  This is not a love story.want to read less trash
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Did not like Angry Birds - Friends, as to participate in the game(unless play as a guest) you must do so on Facebook. As I do not participate in Facebook (or any other social sites) this game was absolutely usless to me.

B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Kiddos LOVED IT!  Though I do have to say this movie was not as funny as the original Monsters Inc.
B00004YTIQ|3.0|It served it's purpose for about 2 months of summer, but couldn't withstand the weather.  Heat made it stretch out so it became very flimsy and then it ripped in multiple places.  It did fit perfectly on my 10' x 6' pool.  I didn't expect much for the price, but would invest in a better quality one next year.

B009CVRQLY|3.0|Celine Dion supplies the energy, charisma and powerhouse presence befitting her reputation on \\"Loved Me Back to Life,\\" her 11th English studio album. The material doesn't always - or even often - match her vivacity and bite, but her professionalism and staggering vocal prowess mean that the album is worthwhile even when it wouldn't be in the hands of a lesser talent.<br /><br />Dion makes these songs sound strong whether or not they are - a testament to her power and skill - but it remains unfortunate that a singer of her command and stature is not being given better songs. Too many of them simply do not leave their fingerprints on the listener.<br /><br />The title track is an adventurous, intriguing piece of modern pop that proves Dion can keep up with the Rihannas and Adeles, yet it does not make any unnecessary concessions. It, and the heartbreaking ballad \\"Water and a Flame,\\" work as individual triumphs. She has never sounded better or more invested in her material. \\"Somebody Loves Somebody\\" also sizzles and sparkles with a gutteral, effervescent arrangement that gives her a real vocal workout.<br /><br />Cloying, often obnoxious production peppers several of the album's selections, underscoring the anonymity and facelessness of the songs themselves rather than buffing them away. \\"Break Away,\\" a chunk of inconsequential angst-ridden rocky-pop that does not suit Dion's style or, importantly, give her listeners what they want to hear, is layered with a melodramatic, in-your-face arrangement that is not a pleasure to the ears. \\"Unfinished Songs,\\" a faint reminder of songwriter Diane Warren's former glories, is also too busy with cheap-sounding swirls and loops, and the unremarkable \\"Incredible\\" with Ne-Yo is much the same. These songs yield an oppressive, rather than welcoming, sound that distracts from Dion's number-one asset - her voice.<br /><br />Of course, pipes like hers can never be truly compromised by colorless production values - the startlingly moving \\"Thank You\\" is proof enough of that.<br /><br />Her cover of Janis Ian's \\"At Seventeen\\" is one of the best moments on the album because its stark bossa nova arrangement not only suits the contemplative nature of the evergreen tale of teenage heartache but allows Dion's considered, lovely interpretation to really shine.<br /><br />Though only moderately remarkable tunes, \\"Save Your Soul\\" and \\"Didn't Know Love\\" are noteworthy for bringing Dion into novel territory. The former is a cool piece of funky, modern blue-eyed soul that she confidently sails through with an appealing lightness and conviction, and the latter explores the full breadth of her register, including deeper, huskier tones she rarely accesses.<br /><br />She also cannot help but enchant alongside Stevie Wonder as they sing his mid-80s gem \\"Overjoyed.\\" Their voices blissfully blend.<br /><br />A living legend at the peak of her talents, Dion has nothing left to prove, which may account at least partly for the uneven quality of \\"Loved Me Back to Life.\\" This casual, untroubled approach to record-making also opens the floodgates for a handful of genuine, intimate moments that would have been left on the cutting room floor in her \\"Falling Into You\\" days. The compromise is a considerable one - except for the title track, there's no big, brassy hit single in sight, and less time seems to have been invested in the final product - but listeners will be happy to hear Dion again regardless.Thank You\\" is proof enough of that.<br /><br />Her cover of Janis Ian's \\"At Seventeen\\" is one of the best moments on the album because its stark bossa nova arrangement not only suits the contemplative nature of the evergreen tale of teenage heartache but allows Dion's considered, lovely interpretation to really shine.<br /><br />Though only moderately remarkable tunes, \\"Save Your Soul\\" and \\"Didn't Know Love\\" are noteworthy for bringing Dion into novel territory.

B0036R92V2|5.0|Wow. I pity the lover of Westerns (not just Spaghetti Westerns) that hasn't seen this film. There is so much to love here, and I really don't want to give any of it away. The opening sequence alone has you wondering about the title character, what he has, and where he's going. The setups and payoffs are pretty exciting, and the hero rivals Clint Eastwood in the Leone films. Franco Nero's piercing eyes, rugged outfit, and carefully chosen words are iconic to the point that it's easy to understand why countless \\"Django\\" ripoff films followed this one, leading all the way up to Tarantino's recent version of Django; that even borrowed the graphics and title music from this one. The aesthetic of this film is worth noting as well. It has a filthy, muddy atmosphere that you can practically feel your feet sinking into as you watch the film. Blue Underground has done a great job with the HD transfer as well. Good stuff.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful program. The costumes, sets and plot line are all masterfully done. Fascinating look at the intertwining of the lives between upstairs and down.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Magnificent!!! Image and sound quality.  The package of the collection is sublime.Like other package blu-tay should be. Recommended before become out of production
B00004XMTJ|5.0|One of my favorite musicals of all time.  I took my kids to see it and they loved it too.  Now we can watch it whenever we want.
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|good, clever.  The action was smart,...and I liked that it was not in the US...although, I'm not sure that it was filmed overseas...
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|This is the final book of this series. What a wonderful book. The other two are just as wonderful an I was happy when I stumbled across this one. The author does a great job of making you feel as if you are in the book with his characters and are living with them. I wish there were more books like this. I love reading about Europe before, during and after the war. All three of thes books provided a different insight of Europe Nd the families that lived thru the war,. I highly recommend all three books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really cool game there are so many blocks cool nether towers I made a castle with a vault and a bedroom suite.
B002U3CCF6|3.0|I have given this book 3.5. Stars as it's another of Flynn's great reads.  I really enjoyed this gripping book<br /><br /> by the author of Gone Girl.
0399255370|3.0|My girls love this book but I think it's just ok. I don't love some of teh language like when one of the crayons refers to another as a &#34;whiner.&#34; Also didn't love the crayon being cirtical of the boy coloring &#34;outside the lines&#34; as it isn't really reflective of encouraging individual artistic expression. I wasn't sure I understood the real point and didn't feel like it got tied together very well at the end, but my girls think it's funny.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. It has been great entertainment on long trips. This game has given me many hours of entertainment during my spare time. Thank You for creating such a great game.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Oh my gosh, this app is totally awesome. I love watching the video roar, ordinary girl, who says, the climb Francis Chan,and etc. You should get it if you are thinking about it.( great for kids too)
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|We bought the Chromecast specifically to stream from Chrome onto our smart TV. Setup was pretty easy... until we realized that you cannot stream from Chrome on an iOS device (iPad, iPhone). You can only use the existing apps -- Netflix and Youtube. That is NOT well described anywhere on the Google Chromecast site. They just say that it's &#34;compatible&#34; with iOS devices. So, we tried streaming from our laptop using Chrome. It &#34;worked&#34; but just barely, if you could even say that. The lag was so terrible that the audio/video never matched up and the video essentially froze. This device sounded too good to be true... and it was. I am returning this right away.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Great movie-a nail-biter! Love these 2 guys! Had me sitting on the edge of my seat thru most of the movie.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I love Michaels voice, I think he could of chosen some better songs for his album. Iran out of things to say.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Easily addictive and fun to play. Very nice way to distract yourself and help time fly by.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I really like James Rollin's books. I have read many. This one was good, but not up to snuff with some of the others.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Before I talk about the book, I have to say that I loved Hosseini’s The Kite Runner, but thought his A Thousand Splendid Suns was just so-so.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed was one of those books that many critics say is “beautiful”, but is actually a bit boring and hard to follow (I come across so many of these, that I think I’m going to start calling them the “beautiful borings”!).<br /><br />Hosseini tells a few interlinking stories that span generations and continents (the Middle East, the U.S., and Europe). Unfortunately, his structure is incredibly disjointed and the scene often jumps to something entirely unrelated without any warning or transition. I found myself having to go back a few pages to figure out how we so abruptly got from one place to another.<br /><br />I enjoyed the writing itself and even the central story of Pari and her new mother, Nila. I just wish Hosseini had a tighter focus and avoided including story lines that were only tenuously connected to this central one. For example, the story of Markos, the subsequent owner of Nila and Pari’s Kabul house, takes up an entire third of the book even though he was only a minor character in Pari and Nila’s story.<br /><br />If Hosseini and his editors had structured the story better and pared down the content, And the Mountains Echoed could have been a truly beautiful book!<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B00FVZAPB8|5.0|i bought this at Target. i work for them and got it on the first day it was released. Love it immensely. Paul McCartney once again shows why hes so good at his game,which is performing and singing. Great NEW music from the MASTER! i highly recommend this to fan and non fan alike! Long Live PMC! :)
B004KZOWEG|5.0|It is a fabulous read. It was a book for a class. I wasn't looking forward to it.<br /> You start reading, and soon you say to yourself, &#34; I need a break from this&#34;, but you can't put it down. Not only is he an excellent writer he did his home work. Great research and backup. I hadn't heard of this history and I have been on this planet for a while. He is now on my list of MUST read authors.<br />Ceré
B00BYCT2MA|5.0|This finally arrived yesterday and I can say it sounds great. I have the remastered CD and I have been listening to that as a reference while I waited for this blu-ray to arrive. I have listened to this several times in the last 12 hours and in my opinion it is worth purchasing if \\"A Love Supreme\\" is important to you and you have the set-up to listen to it. This is the way to hear this music. I am hearing nuances I've never heard before and I am loving it, the bass sounds especially clean and crisp. The live version that's included sounds great as well. Blu-ray audio is great for \\"A Love Supreme\\" where there is so much masterful artistry happening at one time. This format brings it all to life. I can't recommend it highly enough for any audiophile, not just fans of Coltrane.<br /><br />This is the U.S. release that includes Parts 1-4 of the original recording broken down into four separate tracks and another nine bonus tracks:<br />1. Introduction by Andre Francis 1:13<br />2. Part 1: Acknowledgement (Live Version) 6:12<br />3. Part 2: Resolution (Live Version) 11:37<br />4. Part 3: Pursuance (Live Version) 21:30<br />5. Part 4: Psalm (Live Version) 8:49<br />6. Part 2: Resolution (Alternative Take) 7:25<br />7. Part 2: Resolution (Breakdown) 2:13<br />8. Part 1: Acknowledgement (Alternative Take) 9:09<br />9.

B003TQKVGU|5.0|I've read a bunch of books like this, and they're all really great, uplifting, powerful and true. It really is about your subconscious mind. I recommend this book to anyone struggling through life or feeling a little lost. This will help.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is such a great series that just keeps you wondering....I also like that each season is totally different but with the same actors!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend reading this book, even if you've already seen the movie. For instance I saw the movie first but after reading this I had a whole new appreciation for the characters. The movie was great, but the book is soooo much better!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Worth the price.  This is a very fun game. Got through the entire game and more I want to play the bonus page but can't until I leave a review.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love This Game Soo Much And I Link It To Facebook And I Can Play Against My Mom and Dad and Close Friends I Love That. Why Does It Take So Long To get lives With An Addictive Game Like This It Should Take 5 Min for one and 10-20 for full. Full Lives Are Only 5 Lives Why Not More????
B00D7JGL36|5.0|A great music selection.  Love that steel guitar!  Upbeat and fun to listen to.<br />Yes, I would recommend this CD to a friend who likes the rue form of the original country music.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I got this game when amazon had it as a freebie it was played on my velocity micro cruz tablet there where no problems with game play.<br />I got into the game and then noticed that several hours had passed, all i can say is get this game
B00D29CBIU|5.0|I have been working with Margaret Lynch for a couple of years, and her work is first rate. This book tells people how to identify the limiting beliefs and traumatic experiences that are preventing them from accessing their creative potential, and the money that comes along with creating value in the world. Ultimately, wealth and money manifest from contribution. When we are really open and aligned to those higher creative aspects of ourselves, we attract money.<br /><br />Tapping is a great tool for dissipating the energetic charge of those limiting beliefs and blocks. Then we can embrace our true potential. It takes courage to face these energetic blocks and commit the time, energy and money to clearing them. But the joy of birthing your full potential and the money and wealth that follows is worth it!<br /><br />Great book! Insightful, helpful...a very wise investment in you! It presents concepts Margaret teaches in programs that are much more expensive.<br /><br />Its like a cheat sheet to wealth!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|When u think it's gonna be trite or even stale it pops in with a waterfall of new actions that make you want to paddle upstream,  going with it just make you wish you had a stronger boat,  a bigger one that holds all your friends.  Wild!

B002M5E2DW|5.0|Great book!!!!! Really makes you change your thought on life!!!! Great Read.... Highly Recommend!!!!  Every one should give this book a look!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addicting. Looks great on my Kindle fire HD. Good for young and old alike. Would recommend to everyone. Best free game I've found.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|It’s hard to find the right words to truly show my appreciation for this book.  I read Ubik back in February as my introduction to Philip K. Dick, and now I’ve delved into Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?.  In two words?  Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />What makes us human?  What is the clear dividing line between man and machine?<br /><br />In a future Earth thrust into what could only be a full out atomic war, the fallout has forced most of the survivors off the planet.  Those who are left deal with worries of the effects of the radioactivity, to not become so warped as to be labeled a “special” and ostracized by the rest of society.  A new religion, Mercerism, has taken hold.  Empathy boxes are used to fuse with Mercer, to feel his pain on his continuous journey up the hill and through the tomb world.  Caring for the animals still left becomes a vital part of the postwar culture.  And if you can’t afford a real animal, well… There’s always the electric counterpart.<br /><br />But among the humans left behind lurk androids, almost impossible to tell apart from the living save for testing, the Voigt-Kampff scale of empathy the most reliable test to date.  You see, androids do not have the capability to show empathy as humans do.  No group survival instinct.  Practically predatory.  And it’s Rick Deckard’s job to “retire” the rogue androids roaming the San Francisco Bay area.  Specifically, six androids of the most advanced model to date, the Nexus-6.<br /><br />Is empathy the true dividing line?  Yet, there are humans that suffer from mental illnesses that cause “flattening of affect”.  In layman’s terms, a reduction of the range and intensity of emotion.  One of the symptoms of schizophrenia, as an example.  Personality disorders can hinder the expression of empathy as well, such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  And then there are those who ruthlessly kill without regard to anyone but themselves.  Are they, then, human or android?  Who can possibly tell?<br /><br />And does wiping the androids out make us just like them?<br /><br />I at first expected much more action and fighting when it came to retiring the androids.  But as in Ubik, we get mind games, trying to discern what is reality and what it fantasy.  Especially in the context of Mercer, which I cannot get into more without spoiling parts of the story.<br /><br />PKD discusses these philosophical questions, among others, throughout the novel.  Deckard himself must come to terms with the implications of what the answers may mean.  You will not finish this book without seriously mulling over the topics he brings up.  Over forty years have passed since the publication of this novel and still it holds up strongly to this day, even with the dated mentions of the Soviet Union.  A difficult feat to accomplish in this genre.<br /><br />With the exception of Rick Deckard, character development did take a back seat to the world building and the aforementioned questions that were posed as food for thought.  But this, to me, was not a negative aspect.  The plot was well paced and highly interesting.  If it weren’t for school work and other activities, I would have read this start to finish in a day.<br /><br />There was one small detail in the story that astonished me most of all.  I came across the most startlingly accurate descriptions of what major depression is like.  Words that I’ve always tried to express but could not in such an easily understood, eloquent, and effective way.  This quote, in particular, hit me like a sack of bricks.  Deckard speaking to his wife Iran:<br /><br />“Maybe it could be depression, like you get.  I can understand now how you suffer when you’re depressed; I always thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time, if not alone, then by means of the mood organ [device that can change emotions with the dial of a number].  But when you get that depressed you don’t care.Apathy, because you’ve lost a sense of worth.  It doesn’t matter whether you feel better, because if you have no worth–”<br /><br />In conclusion, be prepared to think deeply when it comes to reading this book.  Perhaps that is expected with Philip K. Dick’s work.  I suppose I’ll have to taste test more off the platter to find out.Apathy, because you’ve lost a sense of worth.  It doesn’t matter whether you feel better, because if you have no worth–”<br /><br />In conclusion, be prepared to think deeply when it comes to reading this book.  Perhaps that is expected with Philip K. Dick’s work.  I suppose I’ll have to taste test more off the platter to find out.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was OK to read.  Just your standard romance novel.  A good, easy read that was enjoyable.  It passed the time with smiles on my face.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It holds everything I need and so much more. I couldn't be happier. For the price, it doesn't get much better.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I am a senior adult who has read this delightful story.  Mr. Grisham has included good fiction, pertinent educational material and current creative social media in this book......which is a great read for kids from age eight to eighty.  I will recommend this to my grandchildren.
B00FANXZL8|3.0|Not a bad idea to try and spiff up a middling release. New additional tracks, some new remixes and an expanded package of material including a DVD of the 4 songs made into videos. It's made the overall album a bit better but unfortunately it's still rather mediocre. All of these songs needed better arrangements, perhaps more innovative production and nearly a complete reworking, which this \\"extra\\" release does not really do.<br /><br />The original album released in March of this year was received with undeserving 5 star reviews. It's actually one of the least successful, artistically of Bowie's long and celebrated career. It gets a few stars extra because it's Bowie and he's been away for quite some time. Perhaps the \\"next\\" release will be a bit more deserving of five star reviews.<br /><br />Mark Fisher of the Wire had this to say about \\"The Next day\\": \\"an album of \\"quotidian mediocrity\\", saying it was entirely undeserving of its wide acclaim and that the \\"wave of hyperbole it generated point[ed] to a wider malaise in contemporary music\\" because it proved that anything of low artistic merit could achieve success via \\"artfully timed PR\\".
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Good story, well acted.  Of course, since it was British, we had to use captions.  Why don't they speak American English, huh?
1400052181|5.0|The story of  Henrietta Lacks is an absolute page turner, I read this book in 7 days.  While I was at work, during the day all I could think about was reading this book. Her contribution to science and medicine is probably unmatched throughout the history of the U.S. of America.

B006BY2DBI|5.0|\\"William Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" is a complete, well-researched anthology of Shakespeare's writings.  The plays are presented in nearly chronological order.  Each has an article about the play's history and content.  Each play appears in full as thought to be from Shakespeare, although spellings have been modernized.  Page layouts are clean and lined out to preserve the poetic meter.  General introductions to the anthology discuss the language of Shakespeare's day.  I especially appreciated a discussion of his use of \\"you\\" and \\"thou.\\" There's much more; this is a great anthology.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read every book John Grisham has written.  By far this is my favorite.<br />It is possible to stop reading once you start.  It is absolutely mesmerizing!  By the time you finish reading you feel like you know each and every person in this book.<br />Thank you John Grisham!!!
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|It's hard to put down when you start reading it...as long as you have time to keep going.  It wasn't so compelling that I had to finish it.  I'm planning on finishing it when I have time on a plane to read...definitely a thought provoker.
B002OLV35E|4.0|If ever there was an album to bridge the ferocious & climatic style of Tool and the melodious & brooding parts of Incubus, this is it. Highly enjoyable and recommended.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It is definitely one of the best books I've read and I definitely cried when Tris and Uriah died! I was extremely upset.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Buy this today!  What an awesome story!  I already pre-ordered the other two books that I saw are due to come out in this series.  I was laughing my ass off on one page and falling in love with Drew the next... I can't believe how great of a job this author did telling this story from a man's point of view, and did it so well!  You will love this book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the escape games. This one was a lot of fun. It was hard, but not too hard. I wish it had more levels, but other than that, it was great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been said about the 50 Shades series?  Unbelievable, couldn't put it down, page turner.... I hope that Ms. James has another series in the works!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is really addicting and fun! It's sort of like a cartoony version of temple run. I couldn't stop playing this game! You will love it! I'd rate 4.5 stars, but it won't let me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great so far. Down loaded and installed fast. Now I can download the books I want. Give it a try.
1465408681|5.0|Like all the other LEGO books, this is just a glorified checklist of all the products in a particular line. But they do a good job about not making it feel that way. There is lots of character information and it's all on par with the camp tone of the cartoons. It comes with an exclusive minifig like most of these books do and that's what you're really buying, an expensive character and a low cost book to accompany it.
B00FQ272ZI|5.0|Let me go out on a limb here:  Best Actor 2014.<br /><br />This is a stunning film.  He says barely a word for two hours, and you cannot take your eyes off the screen.  It's an incredible acting job, and hard to believe he was able to do it: physically, emotionally at his age.  You live through every moment with him, and yet, somehow, it's a hopeful film in the end.<br /><br />Don't miss it!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />**** update<br /><br />Honestly, I cannot understand what awards are all about, when a performance of this caliber goes completely unacknowledged.  At least, there was a lot of immediate protest about the fact that he was not nominated.  I wanted to boycott the Oscars!  I stand by my thoughts that this is a once in a lifetime performance.  Really, don't miss it.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A fun and interesting way to present the concept of IT can be managed like a production plant! Easy read with a good story line we can all relate to.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|The cover fits well and I love the automatic 'turn on and off' feature.  The elastic strap keeps the flap from self opening.  The adjustable leg offers optimal positioning.  I purchased the Orange colored case to make it easier to find and keep track of.
B003O86FMW|5.0|They did a great job of writing this book<br />The first one is good too but the book is long and a little inappropriate
B00BD99JMW|5.0|For giving me Tris and Four, and this incredible world! True, it did not end as I wanted or hoped but you told an incredible story and I loved every moment. I really wish you had written the entire book from Tris's POV, and that she would have survived, so that this book would have given me hope. Instead it left me mega sad, but it doesn't make me feel good to give you a one star, or a two, or a three. For this series you deserve so many stars, so I'm giving you the most I can here with gratitude of what you gave us - an incredible experience. Thank you, Ms. Roth! I am of the ones who looks forward to more of your work.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I am Malala too.  Not only do you learn about this amazing young woman, you get a detailed view of the challenges the people of the Swat valley in Pakistan due to the Taliban terrorists.  You get a view of them from the common person living and trying to oppose the hooligans who were so brutal and violant to innocent people who just wanted to live and enjoy their beautiful country and send their children to school to enable them to compete on the world stage.  You learn how much the father of Malala opposed those who would keep knowledge from the children of the Swat.  He is as much a hero as is his daughter.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There are a lot of narratives around this book.  Reza Aslan says mean things about atheists, Reza Aslan doesn’t have the credentials he says he has, Reza Aslan was mistreated abominably by Fox News, Reza Aslan is Muslim and that taints his ability to see clearly on the history of Jesus.  The thing is, none of these are about the book itself.  So I decided that I would read it.<br /><br />There are a couple things you should know about my background here.  I am trained in historical methods, I have read most of the popularly available books about the history of Jesus and the New Testament written in the last decade, and I love the history of religions.  I am also an atheist.  My particular brand of atheism, as Christopher Hitchens would say, is very much a Protestant one, an Episcopal one at that.  There was no sturm und drang and little in the way of imposing dogma in my upbringing, I had possibly the least contentious relationship one can have with their religion while also not believing in it or understanding the point of it.<br /><br />Unlike some, my particular atheism has no investment in the idea that a Jesus of some sort did or did not exist, and so no suspension of disbelief is necessary for me to accept the premise of the book.  Aslan doesn’t really address the question of Jesus’ existence, partially because it’s not really much of a controversy among historians.  Even if you don’t believe in a historical Jesus, however, it’s possible to read the book as a thought exercise.  Liberal Christians will also be able to reconcile the figure presented with their faith, to some extent.  Fundamentalists and Catholics, however, wouldn’t be able to do so, especially believers in the perpetual virginity of Mary.<br /><br />The story is basically as follows:<br />Jesus was a poor man from the tiny town of Nazareth who witnessed his homeland of Galilee impoverished, enslaved, and mistreated by Roman occupiers.  Around the age of 30, he became a disciple of John the Baptist, by far the more famous of the two at the time.  When John the Baptist was executed, Jesus struck out on his own with a message primarily aimed at overthrowing the Temple and the Roman Occupiers — he was attempting to radically reform Judaism and free the state of Israel.  He was killed for sedition against Rome.<br /><br />He was one of dozens of miracle workers with remarkably similar stories, distinguishable mostly by the fact that, after his execution, his message was carried on by his surviving family and followers, particularly his brother James and, later, Paul. The reason Christianity lasted was because Paul changed it drastically from being a critique of Judaism to being a totally new religion, one that Jesus’ brother James did not approve of.  James was killed, as were his followers with the destruction of Jerusalem, meaning that the head of the church changed from being someone who knew the Nazarene and lived in his culture to being foreigners who’d only heard secondhand tales.  Christianity is Paul’s reimagining of historical Jesus, a sort of fanfiction version — the Fifty Shades of Grey to Jesus’ Twilight.<br /><br />The book is not really new in terms of the history it offers, but it is the most readable history of first century Jerusalem that I’ve come across.  If you are only mildly interested in the subject or the subject is totally new to you, I cannot emphasize enough how fun it was to read.<br /><br />Aslan goes to great lengths to reassure readers that the possibility of a divine Jesus still exists within this story, sometimes to the point of annoying this reader, but he also makes a good point about the difference between what modern people accept as history and what ancient people did and the difference between facts and truth.  Since the scientific revolution, facts and truth have become more or less synonymous to many people, but the stories told of Jesus were meant to reveal truth about him rather than be facts.  In the same way that parables are understood to be lessons about the real world, even if they didn’t happen.s.  In the same way that parables are understood to be lessons about the real world, even if they didn’t happen.

1476727651|5.0|Great read - back to the great story telling that King fans know and love.  The characters/places/plot come alive on the page.  Kings best in years!
B0058OUJA4|4.0|The game is extremely fun. You get a variety of towers and maps. Gameplay is very simple and strategies are endless.<br /><br />That being said, the game is EXTREMELY difficult. It is addictive and simple enough to keep you coming back, but challenging enough that you will gladly put it down after a few rounds. Unfortunately, my preference for games on my phone is for something that is challenging, but also something that I can play endlessly without losing, growing bored, becoming frustrated, or even without necessarily winning. Thankfully, the &#34;map editor&#34; on this seems to fit that description. At any rate, I gave this four stars because the gameplay is fantastic. It's a wonderful game that you will enjoy playing. I would have given 5 stars, but like I said, it is almost TOO hard at times.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought the book was great, but the ending sucked !!! Stupid ending and the captivated by you book isn't even out yet! VERY DISAPPOINTED
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|On the kindle I can not access my extra lives but on the iPhone you can?? This needs to be fixed!
B00007BKVC|5.0|The great price, quick to receive, and quality of the product were all perfect. Every time we watch this movie, it's as good as the first time.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is amazing! I have tried so many others similar, and they do not even come close in comparison! Definitely recommend this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This version has things the droid phone version makes you pay extra for. Good stuff. Thanks for finally making it available!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I have watched this movie on two different occasions. I often do this with movies that I find entertaining. Highly recommend.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|All of the girls liked it, all of the guys were bored. If you are watching with friends; make sure your phone is charged, turn the brightness down, and keep yourself occupied and let everyone else enjoy the show.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I couldn't get with this movie at all. I thought that maybe if I would watch it again it would help. I haven't been able to bring myself to do that at this time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love playing this on their kindles!  Great for car rides and waiting room time. Keeps the kids occupied.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie wasn't quite what I expected. It ended up being a very good movie. Very entertaining. I highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I don't know why everyone is so upset about the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but it does involve a large box of Kleenex. Anyway, as with the others in this series, it is very well written. This book was particularly slow in parts, but maybe it was just me. Either way, this is a fantastic series and I could sit here and grumble about the ending, but I won't. Do yourself a favor and read the series, you won't be sorry.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I found it to be quite entertaining. I would probably watch it again in the future.
B0011B8W6G|5.0|Classic, acoustic Jack. Some favorites like Gone, Cocoon, and Dreams be Dreams first appeared on this album. This is one of the ones that'll help with depression.. Did for me, anyway!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I found this movie to be right on. Tommy Lee Jones did a fine job portraying an out of touch husband. I found it thought provoking and funny at the same time. Even though some things were predictable, it is worth watching. Highly recommend.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|A very good modern adaptation of the classical piece. what i loved the most is that they preserved the original text. bravo!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This is a movie that I will be watching again very soon. I found it to be entertaining and full of action. I would recommend.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The only problem is why did they kill trips, that moment pretty much killed the rest of the book. Also comparing this book to divergent this book sucks.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|dragged a bit I. Spots, but overall a good read.  loved the characters.  a couple of good plot twists overall, very enjoyable and worth the time.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Not bad, but not great. I would have to agree with other reviewers - even though the overall &#34;look&#34; of the film is compelling, it somehow lacks the epic feel of the original Schwarzenegger &#34;Conan.&#34; Ron Perlman and the opening scenes in Cimmeria are the high points of the movie. Jason Momoa has an appropriate physical presence but is a bit too pretty to be a convincing barbarian. And the dreaded Mask of Acheron (spoiler alert) does nothing but morph into a spooky looking custom-fitted helmet? Really? Finally, can we have a break from Morgan Freeman narrations? Where is Mako when you need him?
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Really have to invest some thought into each move.  Reminds me a little of checkers. But this is much more complex because the direction of the moves are not restricted and the loss of one bug ends the level.  I would recommend this game.  Job
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addictive, you will love this game, will not be able to put it down. Get in on all the fun
1594202273|5.0|Good story, very readable, impressive research. Not sensationalist, although a story that lends itself to easy sensationalism. No sign of lack of objectivity regarding a difficult and complicated subject.
0399536108|5.0|The Art of Non-Conformity is filled with inspirational gems and I couldn’t stop highlighting entire passages and even pages at a time.<br /><br />One of the very first points Guillebeau makes in The Art of Non-Conformity is that you don’t have to live your life to fulfill the expectations of others. He goes on to write that when you do things that people don’t expect, understand, or find “normal” they will inevitably marginalize you and your decisions and make it their responsibility to bring all of your potential mistakes to your attention. They want to punish you for “escaping” from the expected ways of life. They want to punish you for having the guts and the courage to do something they themselves could never do.<br /><br />If you question the status quo, if you are forging your own path, if you are going against the tide, you are going to come up against a tremendous amount of resistance. “Instead of being easy, the most memorable times in our lives are often the most challenging. Overcoming the challenge is worth it in the end, but the challenge itself is also worth pursuing,” says Guillebeau. “As a general rule, it’s usually better to do something than not do it. We tend to regret what we haven’t done more than what we have.”<br /><br />Guillebeau emphasizes setting your own rules and living the life you want. If that means pursuing your dream of being a writer, having a child, staying single forever or moving across the country on a whim, these are your choices and the opinions of others should not be reflected in your decisions.<br /><br />As Henry David Thoreau once said, “most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with their song still in them.” Don’t go to the grave with your sting still in you. Belt out those notes, sing at the top of your lungs, create the life you dream about and ignore the naysayers. Live your legacy and embrace life as the adventure it should be. ”The tragedy of life is not so much what we suffer, but rather what we miss.” – Thomas Carlyle<br /><br />I highly recommend picking up Chris Guillebeau’s The Art of Non-Conformity!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a awesome game get it you can collect pets bye homes you can play with your pets feed your pets and clean your pets lps rocks. : )
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think this is a really great book it has a great story line. I think any kid would like it.
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Action Action, that is what my son and I look for in a movie, we got our money's worth with this one, story-line ok run of the mill but it was don't blink action and the blu-ray was the best I have every seen, the phone rang four times let it ring this one is a keeper. I watched the features and found out it was filmed in such a way that no matter where you pause it looks like an artiest drew it knowing this made the movie that much better I thought when I was watching it looked different than any movie I have ever seen.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written with characters who live & grow as the story progresses. Kept me reading even though I knew the ending would not be what I wanted.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Not real challenging. But love the upgrades. And choice of guns is pretty cool. Trophy mode is pretty good change of pace.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Lots of varied perspectives on the inter-War period, World War II and the beginning of the Cold War.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|I got through Amazon because I just couldn't find it anywhere!  My parents love this movie and just got a blue ray player. I know they will enjoy it.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|If you are between the ages of 25 and infinity, this book is for you.  You will be able to relate to it and laugh.  Even if you can't relate at all, you'll still laugh.  Because it's funny.  So just get the book already.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|5 ++++++ stars!<br />I am in love with this story!<br />Eleanor and Park made me feel everything.  Just everything.<br />One of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />That being said, I need more!  I need an epilogue or a sequel.<br /><br />Now I'm off to get everything else this amazing author has ever written.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|a really cute (you get to draw your own Stickman) and fun game. (i LOVE IT)  i STILL HAVEN'T GOT PAST THE ZOMBIES,though.
1476747016|5.0|Definitely one of the cutest books I've read in a while. It's not exactly a kids book, but it certainly warms your heart with the cute drawings. I would recommend this to anyone, and for anything. As a casual gift, or someone who is a little sad, it certainly will draw a smile or two on your face as you read it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This APP is awesome! and being connected to Facebook, makes it twice  as AWESOME Love it! Get it my friends.
B00DU74U74|3.0|It was not that interesting. I felt the acting was horrible, the movie was boring and hardly made any sense.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Because I am enjoying reading anotherJR mystery. It is holding my interest to the end.. It is keeping the suspense going and the plot is kept well hidden so far.
B004TSKKE0|5.0|I don't know of any other book that has left me with so many fascinating questions that needed to be answered.  I have spent a lot of time on the web researching other people's interpretations and critiques.  I can't remember a book that I underlined as much too.  Some of the passages relating to the AA hostel and Don Gately were just straight out wonderful.<br />Hard work, but very much worth the effort as you won't forget it.<br />RIP DFW; I hope we can meet up one fine day for a coffee!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Awesome!!! Did I view this book as a sequel to A Time To Kill...no. It is just like Mr. Graham said, \\"depending on what your definition of a sequel is.\\" I can't wait for the movie. I will say, while reading the book, I could not help but to picture the characters from the movie, that was fun. It felt like I have met these people before. I did miss Sandra Bullock's character.
B008K5T5AI|2.0|Sad to say, this was a bit of a disappointment.  Not as good as his earlier Culture novels.  I think IMB was, overall, a 4-and-a-half-star author.<br />Thanks for all the novels IMB!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Lovely expose into Tesla - well written & easy to understand (even if you're not scientifically gifted).  A very uplifting book discussing Tesla's imaginative drive.
1476727651|5.0|While much different in tone than the original \\"The Shining,\\" \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is certainly just as good. In my opinion, King's latest novel might be one of his best in years. It felt more personal, and it left me wanting more adventures with Danny and Abra.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|A beautifully written book. The character, Pat, tugs at your heart strings. Haven't read such a engrossing book in years
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Too much language.  Cowboy character disgusting and unbelievable.  Raunchy conversations.  Storyline weak.  Need strong storyline so one can cut out the language, raunchy subject matter, and clean up that cowboy.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Like the cases; recommended to my friends; and will read it again! I suggest every entrepreneur read this book! It changed the course of my life
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this watch because it was  for a great price at the time. I didn't realize at the time of purchase, but apparently it uses some mechanism that basically allows the watch to run without a battery. A great feature for me since I've always hated going to get new batteries put into my watch.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Although towards the end it was exciting, the tragic event at the end bumped me down into despair and sadness.
B0085YNML2|3.0|This game was entertaining for a short while. The premise is pretty much the same throughout the game, but after completing a few stages, the game got a bit boring
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game some levels are hard to get through but keep trying and you will make it. I play all the time,until I run out of lives,if I had money I would spend slot on this game.
B00846WWVM|4.0|This is absolutely a great game. It's challenging and requires some strategy. The graphics are great. The replay value, however, isn't all there for me.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is at his best when speaking about either the law or the South. When when he combines the two, we reap the rewards. Another great read!
B00881VLCE|5.0|You won't go wrong downloading this app. It is a very good game for all ages, with many choices for the puzzles. You will have hours of fun.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Served the purpose on my double BOB stroller. Holds drinks, phone and more. Can't beat it for the price. Very practical.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So addicting.  I don't normally play games but I am hooked on this as much as angry birds.  Can play it for hours or until my battery runs down then I switch to a different device.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Who doeant like Deadpool. And not the one from the wolverine movie but the actual Deadpool. Hes awesome and resting on my tv stand with the others.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Good read but has a predictable ending. This book drug or to lead further in the series in an unnecessary fashion.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|It's a fantastic movie and now my girlfriend and I can relive the incredible cult phenomenon on Blu-Ray again and again.  Tim Curry is the F@*KING MAN!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This album is incredibly fun to listen to and makes a great playlist for working out at the gym because of how upbeat it is. Definately recommend giving it a try!
B00EVU3S4U|1.0|Pretty much everything!!<br /><br />First off, when the number of producers and production companies out number the cast , unless we are talking about \\"Sleuth\\" (the original Michael Caine Laurence Olivier version) , it is a bad sign.<br /><br />A fan of De Palmas for decades I was so excited to learn he was returning to his sexy thriller genre that he did so well with Dressed To Kill, Body Double and Blow Out.... but the lack of a theatrical release had me puzzled and nervous.<br /><br />I picked this up at Best Buy the day it came out and played it immediately .... I can't spend all day listing the terrible things about this movie.... pretty much everything except how good looking Rachel McAdams is about this film is bad. The look of it is very sterile Canadian production for Lifetime television vibe. It just doesn't look like a \\"film\\" as it were. The actors are placed in world leading ad agencies in towering office complexes but seemingly unstaffed? Parking garages that are empty and they  are at ballets that take place AFTER midnight? It always helps if there is at a minimum of one protagonist with clean hands that the audience can root for but none of the leads in this picture are decent and all get what they deserve in one way or another.  Even the reliable Pino Donaggio's score is limp. The worst thing of all is that nowhere in this hour and a half is any hint of the amazing camera moves that are a staple of Brian DePalmas catalog and for fans like myself are ice cream delicious. Even the awaking from a dream stunt (we see an event and then the person in it wakes up to realize it was a dream) is done SEVERAL times in this movie and it is really a WHO cares? We are also never quite sure where we are geographically as the one star takes a trip to London, the other is hoping for a promotion to New York and the last quarter of the movie we are listening to people/police speak German!  The best thing about this film is making it to the black card with the words onit ...THE END
B003THJA1G|5.0|This show quickly made it's way into my top favorites. The chemistry between Nathan and Stana is amazing and it sucks you in and makes you want more. Highly recommend this series if you like crime dramas with some comedic relief....or if you like Nathan Fillion :)
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|My bookclub chose this book as a change from the heavier literature we'd been reading.  I found it a bit crass, and really not that interesting or funny. Her talent and style are best used on television- a book is almost an overdose of TIna.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|My package of Homeland Season One had two bad discs.  Discs 2 and 4 are distorted throughout and are unwatchable.<br />I've purchased products from Amazon before and this is the first time I've received a defective product.  Really disappointed.<br /><br />Maurice K.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read this book at least 5 times and it never gets old. Love the story line keeps you interested throughout the whole book. Great read!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun for hours very entertaining. It is an awesome game. When I first started playing I couldn't put it down game is very addictive...
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I used it for four days before the lightning portion of the cable just completely broke off. And I was not rough on it at all! Very dissatisfied!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this for the first time in anticipation of seeing the movie that's out now.  I wanted to know the story as it was originally written before seeing what Hollywood did to it.  I'm glad I did.  It was an enjoyable read, and my 14yo daughter is reading it now and really enjoying it as well.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Love this album!! Usually when I get a cd I don't normally like every song. Lorde is very talented. :))
B0045GN5HK|5.0|This album is a great gem and should be more widely known than it is. &#34;Delicious&#34;, in my book is one of the greatest, sexiest love songs ever written.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised to find it available in any format, and am looking forward to hearing the tracks that weren't on the original album
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I'm so impressed with Passenger, the music, the message in the music. I listen to this CD twice its just that good!!! Best money spent!!
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|The story placed me in a rollercoaster of emotions of hatred for the author. Just..I don't think I could get over Mark Darcy not being there or the reason she did it. Those who read Bridget Jones because she was so relatable in her first 2 books, will not find anything in common with her struggle today.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Well I never liked Denzel that much and didn't expect much but like anything about aircraft so thought I'd watch it.<br />Turns out the movie was a bit long and there was more subject matter than just a plane crash, but those subjects are actually extremely common among pilots, so it made a lot of sense. I've seen most and pieces of his other films he acted in, but this was by far the most serious. There was no shortage of surprises either. Everything was done extremely well.<br />A bad movie would have been a movie about a plane crash only. They could have drug it out and impressed you with mountains of CGI, but without good actors and actresses it would have been garbage. The movie was about life not just a crash so job well done.<br />I like action movies but am not about to complain that this was not one.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|2013-11-07
B001AG52AG|4.0|Great movie that I wish would have gotten the sequels that it deserved. The studio had to much pressure and scrapped the trilogy. A shame really :(
B00C5R7F8G|3.0|Book deals with nuclear weapons and \\"misadventures\\". The Damascus accident and related stories related to the Titan project seem at times out of place with the rest of the material.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finally slowed down about 50 pages from the end of Wool because I didn't want it to end....and then today I hopped on Amazon to see if there is anything else by this very talented writer, and I see there are more Wool books! What?! Oh, happy day :) I have not been this excited about a stand-alone sci fi book and/or series since the Ender's Game books. Keep writing, Hugh, from one fellow bookseller to another. You are on the right path, even if it does lead outside!
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|you get absolutely no privacy they can do what ever and how ever they want, truely I wouldn't put it past the government on making this app it said LA times..which they are pretty close with they government, Do as you please but if you've seen south park and the episode the apple company had fine print that no one read and one of the boys gets kidnapped and made into a inhuman, have a good one
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought this out of curiosity, having seen the trailers for the forthcoming movie. The story started slowly but I was soon fully immersed in it, and found that it got better and better - proceeding to a satisfying conclusion. Now I can't wait for the movie - and to start the next book.
1932100660|5.0|Where do you get your protein? It is often a question you here when following a typical vegan diet, and/or, training in an athletic sport. Surely, they say, you will get fatigue, or even muscle wasting, due to a lack of protein. This issue, and many other issues related to diet and disease, are formally addressed in the book. The China Study provides years of documented research, statistics, studies and a scientifically sound method to living a healthy lifestyle. This book gets five stars as it provides informed guidance on how to eat and live right, free of the diseases that plague so many people in our modern day world.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|If I'm feeling down or tired, all I have to do is pop &#34;I Gotsta Get Paid&#34; into the mix and I just start laughing out loud. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Amazing. These dudes can rock.
B00AK57N00|5.0|its so additively stupid. I cant put it down and i cant stand to play it if that makes since.
0812993357|5.0|I only give 5 stars to 2 different kinds of reading experiences. The first kind is the 'OH MY GOD! SO GOOD! I CAN'T STOP READING!' kind where I end up spending the whole night reading the book and finishing it in one setting. Bags under my eyes, exhausted but oh-so-satisfied.<br /><br />The other reading experience is 'This is so good, I don't want this book to ever end so I will savor it slowly, only reading a few pages a day.' Grace Coddington's memoir was like this. She writes like a friend or an older sister/role model. Not only did I enjoy the book, but I also felt motivated and inspired. If you like reading about the fashion world, you will definitely enjoy this too. I would also recommend [[ASIN:0312323115 Front Row: Anna Wintour: What Lies Beneath the Chic Exterior of Vogue's Editor in Chief]]<br /><br />The book also has A LOT of pictures, which made me happy. There's nothing I hate more than when a writer talks about a certain dress or a certain photograph at length and then doesn't put a photo. Grace even drew doodles for us readers! Definitely my kind of book!<br /><br />If you want more of Grace Codddington, be sure to watch [[ASIN:B002QQ8HAG The September Issue]] too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this app about three weeks ago. And it's fun  and really works since I've never been on pinterest on the computer so I don't know if theirs a difference .but I do enjoy this app.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book, with lot of action and drama! Once you read it you wont want to stop.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I eagerly awaited Khaled Hossieni's new book after devouring his first two books (The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns). This book was much different and I didn't care for it.  The story was good, but I think it could have been so much better if it did not jump around so much.  It jumps around so much, that you can get lost.  I found myself losing interest, because, the jumping around does not make sense and the stories seem unrelated for a long time.  It also has a lot of characters to keep track of.  After more than half way through the book, things start to come together a bit.  I hated the end of the book.  It leaves you wondering about a lot of things.  It doesn't give good closure on several of the characters and the book feels unfinished.  Overall, I was pretty disappointed.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I've always thought about what happened to the survivors of that unbelievable book The Shining. This book let's us finally see. Was it the same scare and feel? No, but it comes from a different fear factor. I loved this book and its own type of feeling it brought to the surface. Another great read by Stephen King! Kudos!
B007RTAR64|5.0|Fantastic!  My daughter loved this doll and it looks so much like Katniss.  It is nicely packaged... She may want to keep it in the package, as it may be a collector's item some day.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|It is an great game. I love playing the game. It is so much fun! I love the game. Thank you.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Wonderful time waster. Lots of fun for the family. Even my 2 year old's want to feed the dinosaurs everyday.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read  I loved John Green writing and this is a amazing book
B008JFUOVI|4.0|It almost feels like this movie was so different than the first two that it shouldn't have even been a part of the same series.  But at the same time, the movie was very well written and extremely captivating.  Consider this movie an action or heist movie with funny parts (rather than a comedy with a heist in it) and suddenly the film becomes worth while.<br /><br />The characters seem very different than in the first two movies, to the point that it feels like the script was written by someone else.  Doug is taken hostage, so just like in the first two, we don't see much of him.  The character of Alan seems to have lost all of his humor and by the end of the movie, wants to change his ways.  While this provides a great end to the trilogy, it also seems very out of place.<br /><br />What works for this movie is the unfolding of this huge problem that the Wolfpack finds themselves in.  Several times throughout the story the three will find themselves in a bind, and you'll wonder how they will ever get out.  While no one is actually \\"hungover\\" for this film, the story still carries the same sense of mystery as the movie progresses.<br /><br />While the plot felt more like Oceans 11 than the third Hangover, the movie was still very entertaining.  This film had a lot to live up to following some of the most successful comedies in recent time, so it's understandable that fans were let down.  However, I still very much enjoyed this film and think it was well put together.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesome game I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes fighting games or has seen the movie and the graphics are great five stars definitely
B0025KVLTM|5.0|The Beatles, great band, no other like them, what else can I say, great music for all to get, all my best
B001NEK2GE|5.0|once you have the software this thing is awesome because they already made presets for like a thousand games, so you jsut find it and download it, its really awesome, works great and i dominate in league legends with it! recommend if youre looking to buy one!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This the best game ever. I don't even know if there is anyone on earth not playing this game. There are so many levels and more to come and all are different. I love the challenge
B00E9P959O|4.0|You hear musical performances in it that you couldn't in the original. It may be hard to believe, but Alex Lifeson actually played guitar solos on that album.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Bruce Willis gives anther great performance in the latter part of his career which is still action packed as his films have been become noted for.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|My kind of film. I like movies that shock you, And this had many shocks to it... The Acting could have use some work but by and large it was good and got my attention from start to finish
0847842134|4.0|Nothing more to add about the book itself. Fantastic content. The book seems solid and of good quality. And then some moron who has a special place in hell waiting for him, decided that it'd be good to put a promotional sticker that cannot be taken off, except through hours of scratching and at risk of damaging the cover if you scratch too hard or if you use some product.<br />I don't know if it is from the publisher or the distributor or whoever, but please track the idiot who did this and fire and throw him under a car for me.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A truly uplifting and fearlessly honest account of Adam Brown's life. Well written and completely engrossing, a true American hero.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This geriatric genocidal shootout amongst old pals, propelled by a mixture of testosterone, big guns, insider jokes, even bigger guns, martial arts and deliberately silly one-liners, is even better than the first instalment. It was clearly conceived as a pure comedy and no matter how hard you try you will not find even one serious moment in it - and I simply loved every second of this tasty treat! Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS and also, quite appropriately, some passably lame jokes.<br /><br />1. Characters and actors<br /><br />Almost all of the old cast is present also in this film and it is a mighty good thing, but two of the Expendables are nevertheless absent or almost absent. To my considerable regret Mickey Rourke dropped off and it is a pity but I can easily imagine his character from the first part, Tool, being deceased and currently residing in Valhalla, where he enjoys the company of stripper Valkyries, an unlimited supply of mead and ale and especially an equally unlimited supply of sparring partners he can repeatedly punch in the face, without gloves - and they are all plastic surgeons, something that real Mickey Rourke would probably appreciate... Yin Yang, played by Jet Li, appears only briefly and vanishes after first 10 minutes, but - SPOILER here - no, he doesn't die and therefore maybe he will be back for a longer appearance in the third part...<br /><br />The rest of the gang is all here: Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Hale Ceasar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and my absolute favourite Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), still as insane as he is gigantic. They are joined for this adventure by some fresh meat, Billy the Kid (no, it isn't a joke), a young veteran of Afghanistan war, played by Liam Hensworth. Later on they will be joined by Maggie (Nan Yu), a sexy CIA operative, who will in this film give Barney Ross an opportunity to be protective to a young lady reminding him of a daughter he never had (exactly as in the first film)...<br /><br />As we all remember one of the best gags in the first film was about the various complicated issues all those characters had in their life: age (Ross), cheating girlfriend (Christmas), money (Yang), drugs (Jensen), ear related insecurity bordering on depression (Road) and a... well, kind of problem that men who suffer from it usually solve by carrying enormous firearms (Ceasar). In this one it was decided, I think wisely, mostly to not follow further in this way, with the notable exceptions of Christmas and Ceasar's situations... )))<br /><br />That being said we keep learning stuff about the Expendables and most of it is pretty funny, like the fact that one of them really enjoys cooking and he is DEADLY serious about the correct way of making his rigatoni and also that another one has got a PhD - and no, it is not the kind of PhD you immediately thought about, but a REAL one, obtained at MIT! Oh, and we also learn some surprising things about their ethnic origins...)))<br /><br />2. More of everything<br /><br />This was the main line of action retained for this film and the director kept it this way from the beginning to the end. You thought that in the first time Ceasar used big guns? Here they are bigger! You found Gunnar Jensen a real b@dass before? Now he is badder! You considered Ross bold? Well, now he is bolder! You liked Bruce Willis being bald? Well, here he is balder! Etc., etc.<br /><br />This film has more action scenes, more violence and definitely more raw fire power than the first one - in fact at one moment a T-72 tank rolls in, all guns blazing! There is also much more humour with a great deal of both good and bad one liners and some extremely funny dialogs, of which my favourite is the one beginning with Stallone saying: \\"We are Americans\\"...)))<br /><br />But the REALLY good thing about this \\"more of everything\\" approach\\" is that both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger havemore screen time and it is used in the most optimal way!<br /><br />3. ZE BAD GUY<br /><br />As the villain of the story Jean-Claude Van Damme has finally an occasion to do on the screen something more interesting than his usual stuff - and he gives a great show! His character is so completely over the top that it actually helps a lot to transform this film into pure comedy. Let's just count his evil ways: a tall, muscular guy with a threatening face, dressed elegantly in dark clothes, with a clearly satanic tattoo on the neck, talking with a foreign accent and sometimes going the whole nine yards and simply speaking French. And as if all of that was not enough to show that he is the Big Bad Wolf in this story, oh, let's just name him Jean Vilain...)))<br /><br />4. The delicious trashing of modern metrosexual action heroes<br /><br />There is one great scene in this film involving the background story of \\"Billy the Kid\\", the youngest and most recent member of Expendables, in which both the director and the scenarist (actually Stallone himself) without the slightest doubt took a big bad shot at the modern action heroes, who are almost always tormented and scarred by PTSD resulting from all possible kind of traumas. Well, the explanation by Billy why exactly did he leave the US Army and decided to become a mercenary is absolutely hilarious and indeed parodies and ridicules completely most of recent \\"action heroes\\" and their issues...))) This message mocking mercilessly more modern action films and their heroes is then repeated many, many times, with a very literally use of brass knuckles - \\"you simply cannot beat a classic!\\" ...)))...)))<br /><br />5. The things learned and questions answered<br /><br />Possibly the most important thing we learn from this movie is that even if chicks with guns can have some part in action films, into some places it is the male hero that must enter - and he must go there ALONE! And no, I am not talking here about men's toilet...<br /><br />This film answers also many burning questions we always wanted to ask but didn't have the courage to do it. What happens when Dolph Lundgren ALMOST has an idea? You will find the answer here. How many Stallones does it take to put one Schwarzenegger into a Smart car? Aye, we got that covered too. Can Stallone shoot people dead with his finger? Watch the film and you will learn the answer! Can Stallone at his age still lift it up? Yes, he can! OK, but can he lift it up in Nepal mountains? Affirmative! Yes, but can he lift it up in Nepal mountains, on a plane, under heavy mortar fire and with just one hand? Err... not sure here. Watch the film.<br /><br />6. Other treasures and delights<br /><br />The appearance of Chuck Norris is of course a splendour - the first time he shows I almost cracked some ribs laughing! You will also certainly appreciate an awkward, quasi intimate face to face moment between Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the new decoration of the plane the Expendables use, Mr Christmas disguised as a priest and many other little delights, which I will not enumerate here, because counting to infinity is a very difficult thing - even Chuck Norris managed to do it only twice...)))<br /><br />WARNING FOR PET OWNERS: my chipmunks watched this film with me (from their cage they can see the TV screen) and ever since then they chase one after other like crazy and I hear them go \\"pew, pew, pew\\" and \\"ka-boom!\\" a lot. I am fine with it, but if you have a big dog it can be more problematic - so beware.<br /><br />ALCOHOL INFORMATION: this film encourages somehow the consumption of weakly alcoholised beverages - after the first 5 minutes I simply had to go and get me a bottle of \\"Corona\\". Then another one. And another. In all I went through eight of them this evening and boy, did I have good time! But of course you do not have to choose \\"Corona\\" - I reckon you can also as well drink beer...<br /><br />Bottom line, this is an excellent action comedy, without even one serious moment but with megatons of humour - however, it is rather a film for guys, so it may be better to watch it when your better half is busy with the latest \\"Twilight\\" marathon on TV. I am absolutely keeping my Blu-ray for another re-watch! Enjoy!<br />This film answers also many burning questions we always wanted to ask but didn't have the courage to do it.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent tale about the orphan train of many years past.  Clearly demonstrates why and how it worked.  Children were given homes which were often of poor quality.  Easy for children to be abused.  Sad but it really happened.
B00F6HOW4M|5.0|It is a really great album. i love all of it. i can listen to it all the way through. this is really good work from drake and i can't wait to hear more. worth the money
B00136JQOG|5.0|Cyndi's first album is a great show of her talent and vocal style. With fun tracks like &#34;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&#34; and great classics like &#34;Money Changes Everything&#34; and &#34;Time After Time&#34; and the semi controversial &#34;She Bop&#34; this is definitely one of her MUST HAVE albums.
B00BWHZI0C|5.0|this was a great first album for kendrick. it really opened me up to who he was and made me listen to him and like him even more. this is a great listen also. not just one song but the whole album. worth the money
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I have Foxit on my PC and the mobile version is just as good on my Android tablet. It's very good for reading the PDF bus schedules and manuals I have on my devices without having to open a larger office type program.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Great rom-com....both stars are in top form with an excellent supporting cast, Betty White is a delightful scene stealer and the chemistry between Sandra and Ryan is just delightful.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|You have to figure out the best was to quench the fires and save the huts with your limited water supply.  Puzzles abound to offer different ways to put out the fires and create paths to the next level. Graphics are very good and game play is fun and creative.  Don't start playing if you have to be somewhere on time. You'll never get there!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that this is finally available for my Kindle.  Thank you the wait is finally over.  Really enjoyed it.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Just finished listening to the entire album and it is definitely awesome! She has a great voice and could probably make singing the text from a cereal box sound good!  Her song writing is very good as well.  Although not as poppy as Teenage Dream, I thought every song was good.  Can't wait for the re-mixes!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You know the end when you begin but that's okay.<br />You know it's not a straight line from beginning to end but you happily take the forks in the road.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This is my favorite Disney animation and now it is my daughter's favorite as well!!! The 3D was not that great, but I didn't expect it to be since it was not shot with that type of technology. I love that I also have a digital copy with me wherever we go because my daughter LOVES watching it over and over....even in the car.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have read the whole series and LOVED it! But at the ending my favorite character DIES!!!! I was literally crying my eyes out. Buy this book (series)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I liked the story, its romantic, little bit erotic and it surprised me sometimes. I reccommend the book for everyone that likes romantics book.
B001TODCII|5.0|I saw the movie, liked it, and bought it for my collection.  It is a great movie. I'm sure it happens every where not just in Paris.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Was a very entertaining book. I can not wait to read other books by this author. I highly recommend this book to others.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I saw the movie, liked it, and bought it for my collection. It is a great movie about a Hmong community.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I LOVE GOOGLE SEARCH!  I find myself using it all the time to find out who starred in the movie I'm watching or what the altitude of Page Arizona is.  I feel very comfortable when I have my Droid with me and know I can look up whatever information I happen to want at the time...no matter how frivolous or vital it might be. Life would be very dull ...and uninformed...without Google Search.
B000JQUMPI|3.0|I do not read a lot and this book did not amaze me. Maybe it is for someone else. alright!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This addictive game is the best way to waste away any rainy day! I only get upset when I run out of &#34;lives&#34; and have to wait 30 minutes to play more! Still, the game is great and I love it!
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|The first movie in this series was so good that I kept coming back. I hoped that either of the follow ups would catch the magic of the original. But, no. Part II is an ok movie. It's competently made. It is modestly entertaining. But, there are no real laughs. The storyline is identical to the first two. I think you can safely wait for this to hit HBO or basic cable. No need to shell out any money for it.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Game is fun and hard to put down.<br />The graphics are awesome and make the game so much better then if they were not
0345803485|5.0|I didn't read this book. I bought it as a gift for my niece who loved it. she's 20 years old.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King will always be the ultimate writer and author, this being my opinion of course. When I heard about this book and how it was the sequel to my all time favorite book and movie, I was both skeptical and excited.<br />However, he nailed it. This book was well worth the wait and I highly recommend it to anyone....but they must read The Shining first as it does differ from the movie.<br />Stephen King, you rock!!! From one recovering addict to another, you \\"Let go and let God\\" by writing this book.  You got balls, my friend!!!
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I LOVE THIS WATCH. I ALSO HAVE THE 009 MODEL BUT THE 007 IS ALSO VERY WELL BUILT AND LOOKS FANTASTIC. I AM A SUCKER FOR DIVE WATCHES AND THE FACT THAT IT IS A SEIKO DIVER MAKES IT EVEN BETTER BECAUSE SEIKO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WATCH BRANDS. THESE WATCHES ARE GREAT, LOOK AMAZING AND HAVE A GREAT LEGACY BEHIND THEM. ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING AT GETTING A GOOD ENTRY LEVEL DIVER WATCH OR JUST A GREAT AUTOMATIC WATCH IN GENERAL, I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS WATCH!!!
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|The thing I've always secretly thought with Eric Burdon is that, try as he might, he mostly missed the mark.  Not with his voice, which has always been strong and true, but with the material he's come up with.  Sure, there were some great singles, but a lot of his serious album work - especially in the late 60s - sounded a bit like a little kid trying to keep up with the big ones.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2013, and a 72 year old Eric released an album that is, for me, the most consistent and enjoyable of his career.  His voice, a wonderful instrument that saved some very ordinary moments in the past, has lost little of its strength and control, and has acquired some wisdom with age.  He's also learnt how to push it further and take risks, and he slips between his trademark growl and a completely convincing and endearing falsetto squeak with ease.  And all the while, a fine band that sometimes sounds deliciously reminiscent of the Dixie Chicken incarnation of Little Feat (there is no higher compliment I can pay) thunders and swirls along around him.<br /><br />The spirit of a flooded New Orleans gives us the title track, with lazy, almost drunken rhythms and howling street-band horns.  This is a track that really pushes some musical boundaries for Eric, and it works brilliantly.  In the past, Eric's attempts to push musical envelopes have often ended poorly; not this time.  Elsewhere there are ballads, rockers and a few hard-core blues raves.<br /><br />Refreshing and passionate, `til Your River Runs Dry may well be Eric Burdon's crowning achievement in a career spanning over fifty years.  Let's hope there's more like it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book was excellent!  It had all the elements: suspense, sadness, friendship and love. Curl up and enjoy. Just have a tissue handy.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This one has most of her greatest hits on it.  &#34;Man, I'm A Woman,&#34; &#34;Always,&#34; and others that I can't recall right now.  Have only played it once, so far, but it's terrific.  Would highly recommend this for ANYONE'S CD collection.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Excellent series so far.  Writing and characterizations are great. Many mysteries abound.  Where did the &#34;Others&#34; get all the baby furniture for Claire's baby???
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love to hate this game. No matter how many times I say I'm done, I just can't seem to quit.
B007CFL4WO|5.0|Beautifully acted and challenging topics about which the movie allows the viewer to make up his/her mind about.  I thought about this movie for days after viewing it.  Very thought provoking and haunting.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My friends and family have been trying to get me to get this game for a long time, but my kindle wouldn't except it. Now it does and I love it. Great game. Hard and VERY challenging. So much fun. Thank you, Gina
0307887960|5.0|Lost 30 pounds in 3 months.  A very systematic approach.  My 2 sons also are on the diet and doing as well.
B008XG1X18|2.0|This app never loads correctly on my kindle. kind of a pain to use. I can never rely on it working.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|The headphones itself is great, the sound is crystal clear and it feels comfortable on your head. However it is a bit heavy and bulky, hard to carry around and the wires are very heavy and take up a lot of space. My biggest complaint is the wiring, it makes it hard to carry around and is very heavy as well. Don't even bother trying these headphone outside on the go, you need a lot of space to place the wiring otherwise the coiled area will start to sag and this can be a nuisance. The headphones are also too big so trying to hold it on your neck is very uncomfortable. I really wanted to like these headphones, I wanted to so bad, I'm not even able to return them anymore cause I took them out for a bit too long. Keep in mind however that I purchased this item with the main intent of using it on the go so perhaps this review maybe a bit biased as it's used purely for production and recording.<br /><br />-If you're looking for something to use at home, for recording, production or editing, I would recommend these. However if you're looking for a great pair of headphones to use on the go, look elsewhere.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A startlingly different novel that takes place in North Korea. The author brings the reality of living under a totalitarian regime to vivid life. Lies are told and seemingly become the truth. The main character, Jun Do (an everyman &#34;John Doe&#34;) survives through luck and strength of will. In the second part of the book, he becomes (or takes the place of) another person, Commander Ga. Johnson did much research before writing the book and his descriptions of N. Korea are horrifying. Reading this made me want to read more books about Korean history and some of the real life stories of its citizens. Very deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Awesome! Anyone trying to better them selves in any way should read this. It explains the resistance that you are going to meet and how to counteract it
B009DTI4Y8|4.0|Van is in sublime form in this concert from 1979, in great, soulful voice with a great set-list. The &#34;Angeliou&#34; is unparalleled. The &#34;All in the Game&#34; is a high-lonesome rendition that works perfectly. Only docked a star because of the sound quality, which is perfectly listenable but lacking fullness and dynamics. No Van fan should be without this set.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is fun and challenging and a great game for free! I got this game about a year ago and  I still love it
B00CKOZ8QA|4.0|I had never heard of this guy nor heard any of his music when I picked this album up. This is a really good album. His voice and even some of the songs remind me of Bill Withers, but he doesn't need to remind me of anyone - his voice and style are great on their own. I choose 4 stars instead of 5 because I would like to hear him really explode on a song or two. He comes close to letting go and there's nothing wrong with his gentle style here, I just wanted a tiny bit more. That's my personal preference and not a ding against the singer or the album at all. Way recommended album. I will be picking up his others too, also without sampling them first.
0142501123|5.0|This is a really cute book with great rhymes.  My kids love it!  I read it to my daughter's kindergarten class and they were captivated for the entire story, guessing what was going to happen next at each page.  This is a great story for children ages 2-7.
0385350864|1.0|It is sad when someone creates something beautiful, lets say a painting, and then, in a fit of old age rage or whatever, destroy it totally and then calls it 'new art'.  This is what you have done, Ms Fielding.  Not only is this a horrible book by its self, but it retroactively destroys the two before it.  I am not too concerned about the second book, but the first one was lovely.  I have thrown my DVD of the movie away.  The reason is that the whole way through I am now thinking,  don't bother - he is going to die.  Perhaps in a future world destroying a legacy like this will be a crime.  Was there no-one to stop the massacre?  The question is really, do we as readers have a say?  I say yes.  We have paid for the privilege, given of our time, and at the end of the day, its just wrong what Ms Fielding has done.  This is not Bridget's story, its your own.  Or a new character.  May you loose all the money you made with books 1 and 2 and your reputation as well - the first you don't deserve anymore and the second you do.
B009CVRQLY|2.0|Oh, how I WANTED to love this new album, or at LEAST like it.....  What ever happened?  To start with, why the &#34;vamp&#34; look of the cover?  She does not need that.  She is attractive and at times even beautiful.  What happened to the REAL Celine??  Is she so desperate needing to appeal to the so much younger generation by vamping it?  There used to be mystery where now, I feel, is a kind of cheap appeal.  Maybe I am too harsh.  However, none of the songs blew me away or moved me deeply, as many of her older songs did.  Her style used to be unique!  This album, however, goes the way of so many other vocalists which I have already forgotten.  Why so much screaming out of the songs?  Where is the incredible softness of her voice that excelled?  Where is the REAL passion?  I feel this was a commercial venture only.  Given the lyrics there might have been so much more avenues of expression.  But I can't just like lyrics.  I feel the heart and soul of this artist went on a holiday, so absent are they.  I am glad I can cherish her older albums, over and over again.  This one I might place with the ones &#34;oops, what ever did I do with them?&#34;  Not that this would bother Miss Celine.  Maybe fame and fortune temporarily led her down a path she will walk back on to realize she is SO MUCH BETTER than this!!
0385342071|1.0|I listened to the audio version.  The reader was awesome.  I will never read another of her books-- overly laden with the F-bomb.  The story would have been entertaining otherwise.
B00ESF285S|5.0|I'm a huge Dr Seuss fan and I love this book. I'm excited to read him to my little ones and I hope they enjoy him as much as I did as a child.
B00D3NSDVO|3.0|Started poorly, improved in the middle, but faltered at the end.<br />The main character come across as a self-important jerk - lucky we have the secret U.S. assassins protecting the world from harm.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I enjoyed what he had to say about money however this book was written before the housing bubble burst so some parts are not as applicable as they were at the time of its conception
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I would rate this book 19/5 stars...<br />a. Because I like that number and b. Because it deserves that number<br />I \\"discovered\\" this author when I the first book (half-blood) came out and I have been a loyal follower since.  Jennifer L Armentrout is REALLY talented and does a great job of making these fictional stories life-like and relatable.  To be honest I cried at least twice during this book...and I'm the kind of girl who doesn't cry even during the titanic!!!<br />the title pretty much sums it up...it was just as good as the first 4 books and 2 novellas.<br />*no major spoilers<br />Seth plays a major part in this story so if you decide to read it...you will be seeing a lot...I mean a LOT of him. I actually really liked him.  In some of the past books, I really just wanted to be teleported into the story so that I could knock some sense into him.  But here, I think he has earned my respect.<br />I think if I were ever switched into Aiden or alex's position, I would go insane (like someone almost-ish does) but they did an overall good job holding it together considering the situation.<br />I am still, like I always have been, complete team aiden.  And to reassure all those aiden fans out there, he is just as amazing an awesome as ever ^^y<br />Aiden and alex's love for each other is so awing.  I'm still really young and haven't experienced love yet (other than for my family and my dog Teddy ;) ) but it really makes you believe in \\"true love\\" or that someone can car for another soo much that they would be willing to do anything...emphasis on ANYTHING<br />Overall...awesome book :D<br />I suggest buying it on your kindle or nook or whatever...and if you dont have one....drop whatever you are doing and run to the nearest Barnes and noble<br /><br />And also (even though it goes without saying) you should read the other books before this one
B00BD99JMW|2.0|DEPRESSING!  I liked all the details about what was going on outside the fence but the way they ended a certain character's life just like that...was like YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!?  Others have given paragraphs reviewing the book but all I have to say that it was depressing and reading the last 10% of the book made me cry.  You get so into the characters head's you get emotionally attached and then WHAM!  Ugh...Ms. Roth could have done so much more with the story...
B00338QENI|5.0|The most surprising book...I did not think non-fiction would be this good..it is more than  just He-la cells...there is a person behind it.  I find that the doctor was a visionary yet taking her cells with out permission was wrong..her family should be compensated 10 time over
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun game, very addictive. Good graphics nice gun selection to go through. Levels should be longer, and updates more frequent.
B008YE9226|5.0|An amazing book with a great premise. If you're a fan of Neil Gaiman then you should already have an idea of what to expect; and if you're not, you either will become one, or really shouldn't read this book. His prose is impressive, but easy to read, and his characters believable (even those who are long forgotten gods). In typical Gaiman fashion this story weaves together fantasy, myth, and reality in to a seamless whole that makes you wonder if maybe there's more in the world, another layer of reality which you're missing. It starts off a little slow, but the characters keep you engrossed until the story picks up. American Gods is a truly great work, and I highly recommend it for readers looking for an enthralling tale, a potent allegory, or simply a piece of quality writing.
B005OK725M|4.0|Great movie, full of action. Very entertaining!  Nice to see a female action star for a change, as it doesn't happen often; at least not in a decent movie.
0312935579|5.0|This is a wonderful story of a woman with great values. All women should read this book, it really tells you how far you can go in life with determination and hard work. A page turner for sure. Loved this book.
B003498SDA|3.0|The movie was entertaining enough and the acting good, but its not a movie I feel like I have to watch over and over and over again, like some others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga the best part its free and addicting YOU MUST DOWNLOAD! if u like fun and games that will have u like I cant wait till I get somemore free time to play this  game 100% the best
B000HF6ZR0|4.0|A really enjoyable movie. Definitely not as good as the book, but still very entertaining and keeps you guessing (unless of course you know the ending :)). The actors are fantastic and the setting is perfect. Generally just a great movie that I'll watch again and again.
B00ELERCO8|1.0|Unable to accept licensing agreement. the accept button or whatever needs to be clicked is off the screen and won't accept any input unable to use, deleted from device (Kindle Fire HD)
B004WESFZW|4.0|Wonderul movie and very creative!  I've not seen a story like this before and I really enjoyed it. The acting was fantastic and the action & suspense always kept you going.  Somewhat predictable toward the end, but still very enjoyable.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome I love it!It has tons of cars and tracks seriously download it right away give blood if you have to to get it
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I love the Sherlock Holmes stories!  This is a great way for me to get them all in one place and enjoy the Sherlock mysteries. Because they are pretty old, sometimes the pace can be a little slow and the language difficult to get through, but the stories are always interesting and creative.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|THE WRITER IS ABLE TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED AND WANTING TO KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT.  IT WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It actually stayed fairly close to the book, although of course some things were taken out for time constraints, but I still really enjoyed it. The actors chosen were fantastic and played the parts very well. Suspenseful and entertaining.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I wish I had read it a long time ago....it would've saved me so much heartache.  It basically teaches us about communication, in the language that makes others feel loved, not necessarily in the language that we express love in.  Excellent book!
B0061QD7YS|4.0|I really enjoy these classic disney movies. This one is a great one and has a wonderful story of acceptance.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|My husband and I watched Pan's Labryrinth by the same creator, so we decided to check this one out. It did not disappoint. This movie is very creepy and is being added to our list of must see Halloween movies. If you like scary movies you probably will like this one. I would highly recommend it.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I realize this is a classic, but I didn't enjoy it all that much. I'm really glad I read it, but I think I hated the characters so much that it was difficult to get through. Worth one read, but I wouldn't commit to paying money for it.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I watched it 'cause it has Willis in it ,, I guess I am getting too old, lots of action and &#34;wait a minute&#34; scenes,, I wanted it to be better,,
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I absolutely love all these movies and love that Disney finally put them together all in one pack.  The movies are classic Pixar and so enjoyable!  Its great to be able to grow up with Andy and see the adventures of his toys.
B009178OQA|4.0|more like an inside look of Japanese culture than a story about sushi, I guess that I didn't realize that it was a documentary,,<br />really interesting and engrossing...
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|People don't realize that it is also terrifying, enlightening, painful, challenging, and funny, too.<br /><br />My wife liked it, which means that it is never even for a moment boring, and leaves you feeling happy that you've seen it.  Even my conservative parents were astounded.<br /><br />I've watched it four times.  It was on blue ray in HD, which is dazzling.  The scenery, colors, sound, photography, performances were all mastery.  Are you waiting for that time you're in the right mood to try it?  Trust me, you are.  Watch it.  You'll like it.  Then discuss.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|Thriller  will keep you  up ,,, and going<br />Love the  suspend and action motivated you to want more ,, great music preform  Love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so awesome, I just can't put it down.  It's like playing in a tennis match, with all the different levels.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Im just starting with the app but so far so great. Im happy with the interfase and the number of formats supported.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|Really unbelievable that a game with so much power and beauty can be on a mobile system. And only a dollar? As long as it's cheap, it's definitely worth it. It reminds me much of skyrim. Great game.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was pretty excited about the reviews I read before purchasing my Chromecast, so I was frankly shocked that the support for it is so limited.  I was exceptionally discouraged that none of my portable devices have apps available: a Samsung Infuse cell phone, a Kindle Fire tablet, and even a 3 month old Android tablet that installs the app but shows a disclaimer saying \\"This might not work on your hardware\\" and sure enough it hangs while trying to stream Netflix.<br /><br />The only device that successfully worked with the Chromecast was a notebook computer.  I was able to display Youtube and Netflix using the computer.  The notebook is kept in a nook off the kitchen, plugged into all sorts of devices such as printers, speakers, etc.  Moving it to the living room to stream videos is not going to happen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the streaming with CHromecast using the computer highlighted the second biggest problem with the Chromecast.  Video quality is noticeably worse than the XBOX which is 8 year old technology.<br /><br />So far, I have to rate the Chromecast as a failure until I can see the apps available and the performance improve.  I will be returning mine.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun and a little bit addictive.<br /><br />Several people I worked with on my last job were playing it everytime they took a break.  I thought they were being a little obcesive with it.<br /><br />When I saw it was avaiable for the Kindle, I downloaded it and now find it hard to put down as well.
B00D0QSZHG|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone looking for the answers to those unanswered questions. Thanks Mr. Murphy, for giving me a different outlook on life!
B00BRUPICM|4.0|An unconventional tale. Reasonably well told. It was a complete circle. Very good change of pace from the usual book/story.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I can't help wondering what the author was thinking when she wrote this book. Out of all the directions she could've taken it, this whole scenario is less than impressive and seemed inexcusable even for a YA book. I am not even referring to how various characters were killed off for no reason; I am referring to what has got to be the lamest excuse for a dystopian future ever! There is just way too much that didn't add up here..I mean, I could make a list of supporting reasons but let's face it, this book was bad on so many levels in so many ways that it seems cruel to create a giant list of reasons for why it sucked... The worst part is I'm sure the author agonized over how to finish her series but I kept getting the sense that she just committed to the whole gene therapy storyline out of a desire to go somewhere different and unfortunately, she stubbornly ignored the fact that it didn't work and ended up sacrificing her story and characters for it. It really feels desperately cobbled together after too much thought in a last minute attempt to just be done already.  By the time I was nearing the end I was hard pressed to care, but I don't really understand why she felt the need to abruptly kill various characters either (seemed like it came out of nowhere and for no other purpose than to surprise us). Worse than this, the attempt to split the POV between Tris and Tobias only resulted in them becoming the same person so it was kinda like Tobias--who was my favorite character up until now--wasn't even in this book!
B00E9P959O|5.0|This release,  in my opinion, makes the intent of the band clear, where the original sometimes was 'muddy' and confused.  This release is magnificent in its entirety.....
B00CA4S27W|5.0|I love Blackmore's Night.  They always take you to another place that's beautiful.  I only wish they would tour in the USA!  The CD was in perfect shape and was mailed very quickly.
B0091W7K6K|4.0|Quintessential period piece with Steve McQueen at his manliest. Not perfect because of some slow parts, especially in the beginning, and the almost totally useless side story of the neglected girlfriend. But for its time, a top notch thriller. The car chase is a classic featuring McQueen's Mustang fastback which he drove himself throughout the film, a scene which stands up to today's standards. Robert Vaughn is perfect as the pissed-off, arrogant politician. Worth watching on Netflix or cable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|likes to crash but fun. needs to stop being laggy. costumes are to expensive. when the bugs get worked out of the game it'll be awesome
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|I've loved Donna Summer since 1978, and in my book she has one of the most amazing music catalog, yet these DJs take a classic from the disco era (and the Disco Queen!) and...RUIN it!! There are only 3 tracks that are worth listening to, \\"Love Is In Control\\", \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" and the beautiful \\"La Dolce Vita\\"' and that's it! To do a tribute to a icon as big as Donna Summer, you'd think these DJs would at least use Donnas vocals and not some other group (ie, \\"Working The Midnight Shift\\") or use Dub versions, if Donna Summer was here today, she would not allow this to see the light of day.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Simple, but somewhat addictive.  Good for passing some time, especially waiting for someone to get ready, or if you wake up early.  Aim and shoot, that's it.
B00EHZUQ1W|5.0|I can't tell the world how much I love Devin Townsend and this Retinal Circus bluray.  The guy just makes some of the best music many of you have never heard.  Everyone should do themselves a favour and pick up one of his &#34;Project&#34;/DTP albums.  I'd recommend Addicted or Epicloud if you are just hearing him for the first time.  But anyway, back to the Retinal Circus... it's insane, bizarre, crazy, fun, a few WTF moments all set to Devin's music spannig over his career.  I've watched the whole thing from start to finish more times in a month than any other concert I have ever bought on DVD/Bluray.<br /><br />I never heard any of the Strapping Young Lad stuff before seeing this show.  First listen to Deotx and Love and I was onboard.  That's how metal is done.  Hang on to your hats!<br /><br />Anneke van Giersbergen singling along with Devin, simply beautiful.<br /><br />The finale, couldn't wipe the smile off my face.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!  More please DTP!!!<br /><br />5 out of 5 easily.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|Not very good for ebooks. Most seem to be written at elementary or middle school level, or were very simplistic in its form.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great protection! The waterproof part really works. It is much slimmer and easier to handle than first case I bought (Otter Box). It is a little pricey but much better than replacing a broken phone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Watch out this game is very addictive! I can't wait for King to bring their other games to the kindle market
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun and very affordable to know that the new things are easy to find. No problems with the game at all.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Hate having to pay or wait to continue. Feel that is a ripoff....what a moneymakers for them........  The positive.......its a fun game
B000FC11A6|5.0|I'm reading this book for the third time - it gets better every time. The first time was for continuity, the second time for detail (i.e., looking stuff up, learning some math, generating some random number tables, looking at maps), the third time to put it all together.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a fascinating story and one that wasn't the usual same old theme. Grisham is such a multi-talented story teller. I felt involved in a part of history that really happened. Kudos! PS Hope Grisham arranged for Jake to get that house!
0679731725|5.0|This book moves at the pace of it's time. It unfolds very slowly revealing itself to be the story of Every Man.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love the facebook app on our Kindle fire HD, this app works really well and we don't have any problems using facebook on the kindle fire. If you like facebook and have a  kindle I would download this without hesitation.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game was challenging, fun, and addictive.  I spent hours trying to beat some levels. It was a very long lasting game with MANY levels. It kind of has a story line, but they are really stories restricted to each chapter. The sign painter is very helpful and is entertaining to read. I loved this game and will play over and over again!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Download and you wont be disappointed, I don't think I could ask more from a song, the song has good lyrics, a fun beat and is a blast to listen to. This song gets stuck in my and my wife's head everytime we hear it. I would recommend this song to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed Hunger Games and Catching Fire more than Mockingjay because I had trouble keeping up with this book only because I was losing interest in what was going on. It was missing that spark I felt in books 1 & 2; that page-turning feeling.<br /><br />I had no issues and was very content with 1 and 2, but again I felt I had to keep on reading 3 just to get past the mediocre stuff to get to the good parts which was a little more than half way through the book.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great trilogy, and I am very pleased with how Suzanne Collins ended Mockingjay to bring this great trilogy to an end.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|okay, wished I could change the tile images, not bad but I have played better. Give it a shot and see for yourself, not worthless but not spectacular.<br /><br />I liked Random Mahjong better.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I always enjoy Sophie Kinsella's book, and this installation was no different.  It made me laugh, it made me smile, and it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  It tugged on my heartstrings, and I really enjoyed it.  I got this for free from my library's electronic lending library, but I would recommend spending a few dollars to have this in your library.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this puzzle game and it was well worth the $2. You really have to try, think and be a detective to find everything. I wish the game was longer but it is still worth the $2 purchase because the game is well done and a lot of fun. This is challenging but not frustrating. Highly recommended
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Some answers are never known. Secrets can be taken to the grave, and being alone is the most scary thing of all. Memories can haunt you until all truths are discovered. Great book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, its so much more than temple run and who doesnt love minions :D This is a great app for everyone and I dont get bored. I wish there were more games like this but I think I would lose my spouse if there were :P
1476747016|4.0|Confession: my husband and I are Pusheen fans. We have been known to giggle at many a Pusheen gif, compare Pusheen to our own cat, and even buy a Pusheen t-shirt or two. So naturally, when I saw this book available on NetGalley, I clicked the Request button with such enthusiasm that my tendonitis flared up. (Thanks again to Simon & Schuster for galley approval -- you made my day!)<br /><br />The Content<br />I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started reading through the book, but I was a bit surprised to see that it was basically the Pusheen blog collected into chapters and put into book form. (And, sadly, without the gifs because we don't like in Harry Potter's world.)<br /><br />For the most part, things were well organized, and the chapters and sections made sense. A few times, though, there seemed to be just random images thrown in at the end of a section. Most pages consisted of one or two drawings, and the various Pusheen Guides (cat etiquette, being fancy, etc.) were spread out over multiple pages.<br /><br />While most of the content seemed familiar, apparently a portion of it was never-before-seen material, which was a nice surprise. Even so, the book felt a somewhat lacking and I was hoping for a bit more substance (but, perhaps, what can one expect from a cat?).<br /><br />The Format<br />As an e-galley, this book was somewhat problematic. At first, I was reading it with the Kindle app on my phone, because I wanted to see it in color. But the book was clearly not formatted for Kindle viewing, and the images (which were basically the whole page) only took up about 40% of my screen. Viewing this on my Kindle wasn't as fun, either. The images were still not proportioned well for the screen, and since I have the cheapest Kindle, that meant viewing it all in black and white.<br /><br />Finally, I opted to view it using Adobe Digital Editions on my computer. I was able to view it more like a regular book, seeing two pages side-by-side, which was nice. The quality, however, was on the low side, and I felt myself getting frustrated because I could see most of the images in much higher quality on the Pusheen website. This was obviously not the finished ebook, however, because the bleed and crop marks were clearly visible along the edges.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />I'm not sure how different the finished ebook looks, but either way, I'd recommend picking up the print version of this one. It's a very quick read, but it's cute and fun and full of that Pusheen charm. A great addition to any cat-lover's coffee table.quality, however, was on the low side, and I felt myself getting frustrated because I could see most of the images in much higher quality on the Pusheen website.

B007N5YIUS|3.0|I dont know why but Angry birds just isnt for me, I enjoy cheap fun games but I just cant get into Angry Birds. The graphics are  fun, sound is funny and overall its not a bad design, just not my cup of tea. Its free so give it a shot and see for yourself
0440180295|3.0|My best friend chose this one for book club because it’s her brother’s girlfriend’s favorite book. I can sort of see the appeal, but I don’t think I’d ever call this one my favorite book. The narrator was unreliable, but his voice was distinct and consistent. Once the story got rolling, I enjoyed the different parts, weird as some of them were. The part I liked best was the concept of the aliens who lived in the fourth dimension, seeing time not as a line, but as a dimension to move through as you please. I enjoyed the book, jotted down several choice lines, and was the only person in my book club to rate/vote it favorably.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Works perfectly, although I am slightly annoyed that Apple changes cables every couple of years and charges a hefty price.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I got this book on Kindle when it was on a super sale, and decided to read it one weekend when all I had was my phone with me. Reading a book on your phone is not necessarily ideal, and doubly so for Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. With all of the vintage photographs spread throughout, it really should be read on paper. The images were so small on my screen that I couldn’t really appreciate them. In any case, the story was… interesting. It started out pretty slow, but once things got moving and Jacob finally started investigating the island and home where his grandfather grew up, my interest grew. Unfortunately, it was kind of a let-down. I don’t know what to say other than that it just wasn’t very exciting. I was hoping to love this book, but in the end I only kind of liked it. I don’t think I’ll want to read the next book in the series.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|This is more than a just a thriller.  It is about psychopathic behavior as is &#34;Gaslighting&#34;  The people depicted have no conscience or feelings.  Also read the &#34;Mask of Sanity&#34; and &#34;Without Conscience&#34; if you are interested in protecting yourself from this type of person. They are wide eyed crazy.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I play this game on facebook,,,,very hard to advance to a higher level..<br /><br />just wondering why I can't use the same game from facebook on my kindle fire.  this game made me start from Level 1...<br /><br />seems silly to me but I downloaded it anyway...
0618154248|5.0|Great little board books that are perfect for small hands.  Great addition to any Curious George library.  Perfect baby show gifts.
B00FGKF888|1.0|Needed some information on Anderson for a paper I'm writing, thought this would be a great source.  The text is microscopic and blurry, not able to enlarge in any workable way, to top it off it wouldn't let me download the purchased file into the Kindle for PC reader for whatever reason.  I just need to be able to read the book, unfortunately that isn't easy with this one...time to break out the magnifying glass, awesome.
B00DJYK9ZU|4.0|I put this on my birthday wish list because I recently fell in love with the folk genre and I added this as a low priority item to my wish list. My aunt bought it for me and I actually liked quite a bit of it. Submarines is one of my favorite songs
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love Candy Crush Saga but realllllllyyyyyy addictive.  I have it on facebook, my phone and now my kindle.  Still love the game.
B000002KIK|4.0|Not a bad album. Some good songs. Sabotage, Master Of Reality, and Children Of The Grave are better records, but still worth having if you're a Black Sabbath fan.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Great movie with the famous scene of the hair flip that we all love, a must have for all silver screen fans.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Truly amazing.... An experience so intense with such foresight. This book shares enrichment and patience to understand what we fail to comprehend in only our senses, morals, values, and beliefs. I only wish that some day we will meet other beings in our universe and have sense enough to be able to make a bridge between us, and not a wall.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season is not in my top three favorite but was still enjoyable to watch. There were some really good plot twists and some surprises I did not see coming.  I bought this season new at full price and wish I would have waited until I could buy it used or on sale.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun game to play ... my grandson who is 1 yrs old LUV watching all the animal's.... I like to go on the other broads to see how other people arrange their board
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive was an excellent movie. I think Ryan Gosling did an amazing job in this role. Gosling plays a stunt car driver by day and a wheelman for criminals at night. The opening of this movie takes place at night. Gosling is driving the getaway car for some petty thieves and every second he is behind the wheel your are clinging to the edge of your seat. The entire film itself really felt like an 80's flick. Well worth your time. If you enjoy this movie also watch, &#34;Only God Forgives&#34;.  It is by the same director and also stars Ryan Gosling.
0062255657|4.0|The novel commences with a middle-aged men who after he attends a funeral, he goes to his childhood place, which is a farm at the end of the land. He then abruptly starts having recollections of curious events that happened in childhood, after gazing at a pond....I don't necessarily have much to say about 'The ocean at the end of lane', besides essentially that it was a crossroad between children and an adult novel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator app looks great on a kindle easy to use....it has replaced all the calculator in my house and the one on my phone.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This very long, very dark, and highly imaginative work by Adam Johnson forces upon the reader a series of distasteful sensations, only a few of which are horror, fury, hatred, injustice, and revenge. But by the end, one also experiences hope, compassion, sincerity, integrity, and love
B0034G4P8A|4.0|What language is this movie in it better be in English English I think it is if not I'll have to return it
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Poor App support, no option to use Cast Chrome browser from tablets, trying to go full screen will casting from Laptop Chrome browser doesn't work.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|By far one of the best and most eloquently  written books anyone has the luck or chance to read. Reading this book is not an option but a necessity.
B00FFVML74|5.0|Too short, I want to see more of this show although the ending doesn't really lend itself to further seasons or episodes. So, it's a nice mini-series, good mix between The Killing and Wallander and set in idyllic seaside town in England. Nice character development. Kept me questing who the killer was until the end. See it!
B00BF124PC|5.0|Not sure how close to the real story this is but it is a great story none the less. Done very well and HD streaming to my smart TV is flawless.  A must see movie.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie. There is something in here for everyone. I highly recommend a serene environment and a good sound system or headphones for the most enjoyment and full musical effect!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So addictive!  Lots of fun and creative. Seriously better than the Farmville style games of the past.  Love being able to visit random parks  of players that aren't&quot;t on my friend list.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Connected easily with older iPod and newer headphones!  could be a little louder though, otherwise very nice.<br />Wish it would have a lanyard or other thing.  I think it might be easy to lose this little fob.
0385535147|5.0|As usual, this is a meticulously laid out plot, paying attention to the smallest details, (several times I had to go back to the part I've already read, looking for what I might missed.)  The whole story is tense and would not let you relax until the last page!
B00005N6KG|5.0|These have to be the best headphones!  They fit comfortably in my ear without being obtrusive, don't have super skull rattling bass, they are lightweight and have great sound fidelity.  Sadly, they have about a 2-3 year lifespan.  After that, the connection starts failing.  But they are cheap enough to just buy another pair!
0553386816|4.0|I am a big fan of Grisham.  Took this to a trip, where I didn't have time to sit up to read through the night. This was a perfect bed time read, each chapter interesting, different, short, enjoyed them all.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|Not often does a film, a reimagining, a prequel or a variation of a beloved classic actually come together and work.<br /><br />Disney's Oz The Great and Powerful is just such a film. Not a small feat considering the HUGE shoes it's trying to fill. The Wizard of Oz is one of the most well known and beloved films of all time.<br /><br />The story of how Oz came to be as we've know him all our lives is both a loving tribute to the original, but a refreshingly new take of the classic giving us all we could ask for, a new look at this magical land and a story that pleasingly fills in gaps in the original and breathes new life into the story.<br /><br />The cast is pretty much perfect blending together new and old. Franco playing the title character as a fast talking con artist/magician a charlatan/shyster of sorts is well suited for the role and by the end of the film I was cheering him on. Kunis, Weisz and Williams play the three witches with both nods to the original characters and offering us some new insight on what they may have been like in their younger days.<br /><br />I loved the way the film starts in full screen sepia tone and then goes to color like the original of course now the color sequence turns the film to grand widescreen presentation only making the change all the more dramatic. I'm a fan of the original(who isn't?) , but I must say this film will sit right along side of it and I may visit this prequel more often than the original ..especially since I've seen the original countless times.<br /><br />I haven't seen the 3D version and wish now that I had gone to the theater to see it. The Blu Ray looks fabulous and the detail to the land of Oz looks breathtaking. The China Doll from China Town is a stand out as one of the characters from a place in the book that didn't make the original movie. I can't see how any fan of the original wouldn't like this film, it offers what all remakes or continuations of films should offer something new without taking away anything from the original!<br /><br />My only gripe and reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is that the video release is filled with greed. To offer the DVD, Blu Ray and 3D Blu Ray on separate releases only is just ridiculous! If you want to recoup some sales in the home theater market then give consumers a reason to buy it! Put all three versions in one package...how much do blank discs cost anyway??? Very cheap trick Disney! ..but you're not fooling anyone!way anything from the original!<br /><br />My only gripe and reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is that the video release is filled with greed.

B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|It was stupid. Nothing at all like the characters that I grew up with. The plot made no sense whatsoever.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was my favorite book. I loved it. The way the author described Jason he sounds so cute and him and piper make such a cute couple!!!!!
B00ECJ18HO|5.0|This is a classic mystery, one of my favorites from childhood.  This particular edition, with original illustrations from the magazine in which it was first published as a serial, make the story just as exciting as if reading it for the first time.<br />Rick Hofmeister
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|Its hard to find quality sounds like this. Robert Glasper always knows the right chords to hit and the best artists to add to his albums. Well done.
B008Q0C248|4.0|Only watched for class. I followed along with the written taking notes and highlighting (as it is the play word for word). Seeing the action really helps with understanding what is happening. In that respect this was great. Other than that it was awful to get through because I am not a Shakespeare fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just installed this and now I can't put my kindle down. Real fun but frustrating when I get stuck on a level.<br />My son and I were fighting over it . Finally he put it on his phone so he can play on his own.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game! It is very challenging and intriguing. Keeps me coming back for more. Requires and improves good hand-eye coordination.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It kept my interest, and, though it wasn't as suspenseful as the first book (because of my being more familiar with the circumstances,) I was not prepared for the ending!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|loved it.  i want to read it again.  i cant put my finger on why I loved it so much except that she is honest, heartbroken and real and shares it all with the reader.  Very moving and interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It has not opened this week and all I get is not opening send report, then I send a report and get no answers
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I cried and cheered. This movie was well done. It will make you reflect on what's important in your life and the people in it. It does not beat you to death with a lot of preaching but is religious based,  but is straight forward. Anyone of any faith can enjoy and relate to the characters in this well acted movie. It is a great film for men. It truly speaks from the male perspective when it comes to faith and family. A must see.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Excellent historical analysis of USA as an empire with all its contradictions, abuses of power and double talk of its leaders.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It's fun but 15 minutes<br />I say like 20<br />Because some people<br />are only allowed to<br />play for 20 minutes.<br />And need to<br />1.Be able to sleep at night<br />2.longer time<br />3.play with friends.
B00FRMDH7Y|3.0|For me it really wasn't good nor bad. As children movies go it has Some good themes.  Like yes even a snail can be a racer. I think I was expecting something different with this movie.  Less human world and more of the  snales world.  LIke a bugs life or ants.
B0058O84G0|5.0|Ken Follett's stories are captivating.  I learnt so much about the history of the cathedrals in England. It was lovely to read about places which I have visited.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-Men: First Class is awesome! Simply out, it's a great movie. I'm a comic book fan and while the comic book will always be better, compared to the horrible comic books adaptations out there, this movie doesn't do such a bad job. There are a few things that are annoying and don't correlate with the comic book lie Mystique looking scaly and like a lizard, Angel being a girl or black, The White Queen and The Black King being too old, and Havok only having the ability to use his power and send it out through his stomach along with a contraption for help.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This calculator has not changed in about 30 years and probably for good reason.  It does everything that is needed.  As an appraiser, it is a definite must.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Game Of Thrones has is a great show for many reasons. The nudity, the violence, the murders, and the interesting plots. The first season really gets you going and it is a motivator to read the books if you haven't already read them.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved this book and became very invested in the characters and the exotic and tragic life in India. Definitely worth the time to read.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I'm so disappointed. I bought this to hook to my Zoom H1, but the input is so extremely quite that I can barely hear anything. It looks like many other people have the same problem. Shame on Audio-technica for stealing my money.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Michael Connelly at his usual best. looking forward to the book In the series, Harry Bosch is a character I never get tired of.
0446581356|5.0|I'm 30 and have been wearing makeup since my teens but recently realized I still don't know very much about how to apply it.  This book is exactly what I was looking for.  It's very comprehensive, highlighting everything from how to choose the right products to how to apply makeup, and even how to get your start as a professional makeup artist.  As a novice I was less interested in the 'artistry' aspects of the book since I don't ever intend to be a professional makeup artist, but even with that content I still felt like a got a lot out of the book.  Prior to picking up this book I read [[ASIN:0743250362 Trish McEvoy: The Power of Makeup: Looking Your Level Best at Every Age]] and I SO wish I had picked up [[ASIN:0446581356 Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual: For Everyone from Beginner to Pro]] first because this book is SO much better.<br /><br />I loved how visual it is.  It is loaded with pictures, especially when it goes through makeup application.  They are also well done and do a good job of breaking down different makeup applications into steps that are easily digestible and understood.  I also appreciated that there was more information on special conditions like covering up blemishes than I had seen in other books and that the book is pretty detailed on makeup application for different parts of your face, not just eyes.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, there was some content in this book that didn't seem as relevant to me as a newbie, but it didn't negatively impact the usefulness of this book.  I would definitely recommend it for other makeup newbies like myself.
B002Q6OH0K|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time - a must read for any book worm!  I would definitely reccomend this!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This game was much more engaging than I thought it would be. Got it when it was the free app of the day but would be happy to pay for a well made app like this.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed: it's a battery sucker sometimes. I try to remember to stop the app entirely when I'm done because it seems like the battery dies pretty quickly if I leave a flight simulation running while I switch to another app or let the Nexus 7 go into standby.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you have enjoyed any of Stephen King`s books in the past, make sure to pick this one up. You may not be able to put it down. It's a fast paced look into the future and past of Daniel (Doc) Torrance.  After the Overlook Hotel, his life turns upside down once again, and he finally meets someone with whom he can sympathize and understand.  5 stars from me because I believe unlike some other of Mr. King`s books, this one keeps you wanting more and does not drag on needlessly.  Enjoy this read for what it is, excitement and horror, all rolled into one!
0811875040|5.0|I love cookbooks and this is one of my favorites.  The cake and tart recipes are amazing but the frosting recipes are over the top!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm very thrilled with this site, as I have finally found a place where I can view all seasons & episodes without buffering issues.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another classic story from a gifted author. A fantasy-type story that recalls a childhood incident that is full of magic.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|An amazing story. Beautifully written. Amazing young lady. Can't wait for my daughter to read this book. Wish there was more to read about Malala. Really really good book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app . . . I use it on my Kindle Fire, and on my Lenova Yoga convertible. Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|allows us to watch Netflix in bed.a bit tricky to set up but works well once chromcast has been installed. would recommend to anyone that does not have a smart TV.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this daily.  I like to keep my devices clean of junk and free of unnecessary memory usage.  Seems to keep my battery alive longer also.
B00FIYEZYA|5.0|I loved Mastermind, but that one felt more like a straight up heavy rock album and it's really great to hear Monster Magnet get back to their stoner rock roots. Probably the best album they've put out in years. Buy it.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Best crime &#34;dramedy&#34; ever!! Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic really move their characters forward in the 2nd season.  Stories and crimes are inventive and keep your attention.  Season finale goes a different direction than expected and sets up beginning of season 3 with a lot of angst and heartbreak.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|A very fun, addicting farm game! Easy to learn, quests are easy, and your crops don't go bad just because you haven't played for a while. Great 'G' rated game and fun for the whole family!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The only movies I had watched was iron man.  This movie was very interesting full of action and did not dissapoint. I love all the actors in them
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is one of my all time favorite shows.  Some of the CDs are defective and have a tendency to cause GREAT annoyance...wish Amazon was a little more attentive to quality.  Nevertheless, the show is great and has never disappointed.
0316228532|5.0|this book was in excellent condition on receipt. every imperfection (which were minimal) was listed on the page before purchase. no surprises.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This was the perfect first book to read on the Kindle HD. Dickens Christmas Carol captures the spirit of the season and reading it fills in all the blanks that the numerous movie and radio adaptations have left out for the sake of time.<br /><br />Downloading was easy and the price (free) was right. If you are looking for a new Christmas tradition, take up an annual reading of A Christmas Carol.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was a good book, but I felt like some parts just dragged on to take up space. However, the way the story was told was quite interesting.<br /><br />Don't know if I'll be reading another book by this author.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Fun to play.  Well designed game that works well on Kindle HD 8.9  I think this is every bit as good as the version on my pc.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love this movie.  I've been to India and this reminded me so much of that trip.  Great actors, just a nice feel good movie.
1250038820|5.0|I read a couple bad reviews before, and I must say, people be CRAY.    Dis s*** is off the hook, mayn!!! I havent flipped through the whole thing, CAUSE I DONT WANT TO.    I wanna take it in bit by bit, prolonging it's life forever. I think I'll look at a couple pages once a week, and maybe I'll be able to feed on it's magic for a couple years... Then bury it in a bookshelf and rediscover it every 5 or 6 years and feel the magic all over again..... GET. THIS. BOOK.
B004I9CXHW|3.0|Is not compatible with iPhone 5.  Get standard error message &#34;This device is not compatible...&#34;  Can still use it to charge, but not control or play music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was curious about this ever since it first hit the market. We got rid of all those ridiculously priced cable channels and went with the basic network stuff and high speed internet. Then, signed up with Hulu Plus, Netflix and Amazon Prime. We've been using our Xbox's to run those apps which requires lots of wires, and, of course, two Xbox's at a cost of $250 apiece plus an Xbox Live account. A $35 'dongle', needless to say, was intriguing.<br /><br />It arrived today. Installation was a snap (plug it into the HDMI port and the power to our power strip, done!). Then surfed to the installation/setup page at google.com/chromecast/setup which walked us through the connection between the 'dongle' and our network. Hint: Be sure to have your network info handy when doing the setup! (username/password, etc.).<br /><br />We had one snag.. the UPnP was not turned on in our router. That is the Universal Plug 'n Play that is required in order for the setup to 'detect' your device. Luckily I have just enough knowledge in how to log into the router. So I did so, turned on the UPnP service, restarted the router (to initialize that feature) and re-ran the setup. Bingo! Found it no problem, finished the setup and wound up at the quick tutorial video that shows how easy this really is to operate.<br /><br />I installed in on:<br />My desktop PC (must have Chrome browser, which I use as my default anyway)<br />My Android phone (playstore app is required, but simple to get from the playstore)<br />My Android tablet (Nexus 7)<br />My wife's Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S3)<br />My wife's laptop<br /><br />For the phones, you need to download the Chromecast app AND, of course, the apps for Hulu Plus, Netflix and YouTube (which should be on your Android phone anyway)<br /><br />For the PC's and laptops, you only need to install the Chrome Extension for Chromecast (takes about 1 minute).<br /><br />Now, in the upper right hand toolbar area of your Chrome browser, there's an icon you click and it asks where you wish to broadcast that tab's content to... the screen/tab you are viewing on OR switch to Chromecast. Immediately upon switching to Chromecast your TV will display that page on your screen. Awesome! Now we watch online shows like Survivor on the TV instead of the small laptop screen!<br /><br />For Hulu and Netflix, if on your PC/Laptop just surf to those sites in Chrome, hit the icon and it will broadcast whatever you're watching on to the TV.<br /><br />From your smartphone and tablet, open the apps for any of these (or, use the Chrome browser) and you will notice that same icon at the top of each app's home screen. Tap it to select where you want to view what you're watching. Voila! It sends it right to the TV.<br /><br />This was simple, convenient, ridiculously unintrusive as opposed to having to require the Xbox or Roku or any other device to do the same thing.<br /><br />But! Don't expect 1000's of apps supported... yet! But, if you can't watch it on Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube or somewhere on the WWW via your Chrome browser, then I don't know what to say. Except, then, this isn't for you.<br /><br />Everything we've watched has been sharp and clear. No hesitations in delivery and the device you're broadcasting from becomes the remote control for what you're watching.<br /><br />I can easily see having multiple Chromecasts. Especially at this price! We're not even remotely disappointed and, in fact, the product exceeded our expectations. Buy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is very fun and addicting even my 5th grade teacher loves it because she likes minions.
B003ZZAXFO|5.0|Peter Gabriel is such a unique vocalist. He has better lyrics and has a better sound than Phil Collins. His brand of music is cutting edge. I would suggest this for the serious music collector.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I am so happy that it is available on kindle again addicting fun game.<br />Love love love it!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Ok. now sure how many times I can rave about this series! I keep missing them at Comic Con. If you are a fan you will love the gag reels
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'm normally someone who really enjoys most books that I read, AND I don't mind a depressing book/ending, if it's for a good reason. For example, in the Hunger Games trilogy, while the last book is definitely depressing (and tons of people complained about it), I thought it was really necessary to get a message across and to be realistic. I respected the author for ending the trilogy that way. So, I'm not bothered that Allegiant was somewhat depressing and had an unhappy ending, I just wasn't satisfied with what made it that way.<br /><br />The first two books were great. They were fast paced and hard to put down. And the cliffhanger in Insurgent was fantastic! I was SO excited for Allegiant, but it turned out to be... dull. I had to force myself to keep listening (I had the audiobook, since I spend so much time in my car). I didn't really like the dual perspective (though I understand why she did it), and I didn't like Tobias very much in this book. I really liked his character in the last two books, but he fell flat in Allegiant. There were some political messages/warnings tied into Allegiant, which I appreciated, but the thing is, most of the book happens outside the fence, and what's outside the fence just wasn't all *that* interesting. Or maybe it was that the conflict wasn't that interesting until the very end, but by then, it felt a little out of place, rather than it building up to that conflict throughout the book.<br /><br />Basically, a lot of this book felt like forced drama- overreactions and decent amounts of killing off characters for no reason or for weak reasons. It wasn't a very satisfying read, and it does not match the pace or the intrigue of the first two books.<br /><br />I can't imagine not finishing a series, so I would still read this book if you read the first two. Just adjust your expectations beforehand.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I am such a fan of this show! This is the one television series that I own all the seasons
B00G4PX1MO|4.0|This is a great follow up to the first version. The three heroes given are more than enough to play through, but the additional heroes available are way too pricey. $40 for a tablet game (if you purchased all additional heroes) is outrageous. They do have sales from time to time, but even then they are still expensive. Again, you can have great gameplay without the extra characters, but it would have been nice to have a more reasonable price for extras. Price is only reason for four stars, otherwise would be 5.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the second half of the book, the first part was very heavy with historical information which was a little hard to follow....
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app allows me to interact on Facebook without any problems so far. The format is different from my PC naturally, but when you need to connect via the Kindle...this app works well!
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|After the glorious synthpop plus of Supernature, Alison and Will continue to mine those spinal shivers with this emotive pastoral perfection. The duo continues to strive for something fresh and exciting, and it is only fitting that they should venture into more sedate territory. Little Bird, with its Beatlesque psychedelia and soaring vocal coda is probably the best thing they've ever done. Like Time Out From The World from Supernature, it is secure on my continuous playlist. Wonderful sounds and arrangements abound, and I have to say this album really highlights Alison's vocal prowess and versatility (has anyone else noted that Norah Jones quality), never more impressive than on Road To Somewhere. Catchy tracks like A&E and Caravan Girl show that their clubbing sensibilities are not totally subdued, but this is really their meadow mellow, slow dancing album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally Amazon developers get the real thing! I don't play games very often but when I do this is the one and I can't interact with my friends on FB without fearing game &#34;downloads&#34; on my PC. So far it works flawlessly!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Pretty cool kinda hard to aim,worth the money I guess, no glitches runs smooth and really good graphics, I recommend it to anyone who likes first person shooters, one of the best I've found for the kindle fire
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I love all the songs in this album. Outta my head is one of my favorite songs and a great song to hear in concert.
B001684L0A|5.0|I love history, and with John Adams being one of my favorite founding fathers I anxiously awaited to critique this miniseries.  I found the series to be quite accurate with the context of the book by which it is based upon.  Beautiful imagery, great acting, doesn't get much better than this mini-series.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Sure it might be fun but it takes forever to load!!!! I like it but it's very slow. Good luck
B001TKK3O8|5.0|Excellent thriller.  Twists and turns keep you guessing what happens next.  Truly one of my favorites.  Great performances from well respected actors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app I recommend it for all people with or without an imagination me and my little brother love this app and can't wait for the next update r here it will be alsome
B00BSB2AE4|3.0|As a long time fan of the blog, most of the comedic stories were not new to me, and in fact had been edited for the book in a way that took away from the humor so plentiful in the original versions.  As a long time fan of the blog, I'm also aware that Allie has some tough times, but as a buyer, I eagerly awaited this book expecting fantastic new humor.  What I got was a few feeble repeats of stories I'd already heard, and a talented young woman heartbreakingly crying for help.  Allie, I hope you get it.  You're wrong about you.
1250012570|5.0|I am so in love with this book. I recommend it to all. Some people aren't able to depict a teenage romance, but Rainbow Rowell is able to. I cried so much when I finished the book, which I read in less than a day. It tugged at my heart and I loved everything about the book. The story reminded me so much of my high school love, whom I am still with today.<br /><br />I immediately loved Park, even though I was kind of iffy about Eleanor at times. But you can't really understand her behavior until you learn her background which is revealed piece by piece in the book. I loved them as a couple in the book and it was one of the most romantic things I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Please buy this book, you won't regret it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved this book. The characters were well-developed, complex and relatable. Interesting how the characters' lives intertwined. Life is indeed all about choices.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is awesome. Especially in the first season. This entire dvd is a perfectly flawless thrill ride. GET YOUR OWN.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|Free to download but you cant play unless you buy coins for the gMe to buy your robot to start the game. Pretty sad
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The such a great game i recommend this to everyone but the only flaw is has is that its super addictive
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Trite with very little substance, but if you are a Zombie lover you might like this movie.  Most of the movie is humans turning into Zombies running through the streets of the world screeching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome more games beat out of the three the third book is about war fare first great also great series
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book took me on such an emotional  rollercoaster. I literally felt every emotion I have. It made me take a look at my own life and realize just how lucky I am and not to take so much for granted. This truly taught me so much. Jojo Moyes did such an amazing job at depicting each character's feelings and point of views that I could feel their feelings. I laughed, I got angry and I cried my heart out. This is the third book of hers I've read and I plan to read them all because she has yet to let me down.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|AMAZING TOUR! The remake of some of her biggest hits is stellar. The sound is great and the way the songs are composed and linked is great. I specially like the Open your heart/Sagarra Jo and the I'm a Sinner/Cyberraga songs. This record is definitely worth getting.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|It's a great way to jumpstart your brain in the morning. This game is a real find. I don't understand how it calculates the score,  but it's still a lot of fun.
B008ASGP3U|3.0|Not the best in the series, but it's still Rebus.  However, I wish Rankin hadn't brought Macafferty back to life.  That story was properly ended.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read.  Enjoy reading a first hand account of historic events that we can all celebrate.  OBL was a focal point for so long and we can rejoice in his capture and death.  THANK YOU to all the men and women that serve our great country and have our backs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game play with the hubby. Fun to pass the time and interact with people. Great game give it a try!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to see this is finally available on my kindle fire. Works just as good on kindle and my phone
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Shipping was fast! Condition was good. God how I love this show! Every season it gets better. Bring on season 9!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Well written historical novel and an entertaining way to become aware of facts surrounding World War I. The narrative is so entertaining that 800 pages end up being short and in the end you end up wanting to know more about the characters in the novel.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It is inconvenient having to remember to carry around adaptors but the trade off is that Apple can make computers thinner.  There would be no way put an RJ-45 port in either a MacBook Pro Retina or MacBook Air so this is a nice compromise.  Once could make the argument that Apple should give us this free but I am willing to bet less than 1/4 people would actually use it.<br /><br />Chose this over the USB one so that I could take advantage of using the Thunderbolt port.  I purchased this solely to have as a backup or just in case.  Do not anticipate needing to use it much and in my test it worked fine.  Essentially plug and play.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I gave this book a try because it was highly recommended by a professor at my school.  I really hate I wasted my time.  I gave it a two star rating because, it took me forever to finish reading the book.  The book seemed very long and drawn out, and it had some errors.  It took forever for me to get into the book, because it really didn't get interesting until about the 50% mark. A lot of it seemed very predictable. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down, but after so long, everything seemed to start being over the top.  By the time I got to the end, I was so exhausted that it was ridiculous.  I was very dissapointed with the way it ended because it seems like the ending was rushed.  It just stopped abruptly like walking over the edge of a cliff.  I even flipped back a couple of pages and reread some of it because I thought I was missing something.  I literally wanted to throw my kindle.  I feel if the author would have put forward more energy to the end of the book, and not concentrating on making the beginning so long and boring, the book would have been a lot better.  I only finished the book, because my teacher was waiting on my thoughts of it.  My teacher wants me to read the rest of this author's books, but I think I'll pass.
006202406X|3.0|There are some things about Allegiant that I think will turn off those who read Divergent and Insurgent:<br /><br />1) This is no longer \\"inside the fence\\" so the entire plot of this book is nothing like the last two. There's far less running, action, shooting, etc.. and far more discussion and angst from psychological issues. It's scientific and not battle-tastic.<br /><br />2) The ending is polarizing. There are some types of readers who will embrace it and some who will hate it.<br /><br />3) The POV jumps between Tris and Four, but they are almost indistinguishable (no seriously, I had to go back to the start of the chapter to check who it was sometimes). That's frustrating for a reader. It also means that much of the witty banter between our favorite couple has disappeared. They (sadly) spend a lot of time angry at one another.<br /><br />4) The side characters are MIA for most of the novel. Which is sad, because I think Roth did an excellent job creating other characters full of depth and life. The plot was slow to move due to an influx of information, and yet we received next to no information on how the other characters were handling this HUGE change in their world.<br /><br />So here's the bottom line: can you handle it if it doesn't end like a Hollywood perfectly packaged present? Yes, great - keep going.<br /><br />No? Stop now and pretend the third book wasn't written. Seriously.<br /><br />But all that said, I still loved Allegiant. Roth has a distinct writing style that I truly enjoyed, and I never felt that this was a slow moving or uninteresting novel.<br /><br />It did turn my perspective on Tris' world upside down because of the major revelations. I'm shocked that this is where Roth had intended to take the series all this time. The huge world outside of Tris' previous one is such an adjustment, and it almost makes you feel like all the heroic actions of Tris and Four are insignificant on this new grand scale. That's new. I like that they are thrust into a place neither of them can control or be top dog of.<br /><br />I truly loved the end and couldn't have seen a better way for it to go. I hope that in time the fans that are upset by how this book went can return to it and see that it has a lot of great qualities despite some disappointing ones as well.t into a place neither of them can control or be top dog of.<br /><br />I truly loved the end and couldn't have seen a better way for it to go.

B000BC8STM|2.0|I had to return this DVD. It stopped and started every few minutes. It was far less than perfect quality. Think in the future I'll go elsewhere to buy my music and DVDs or Blu Rays.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'd recommend not reading this at work like I did but know that I will understand that you're too sucked in to stop yourself.<br /><br />It was amazing and scary and beautiful and sad and exciting and....I loved it!<br /><br />:)
B000AP04OM|4.0|what can I say, it is a classic movie that will never go out of style.  Andrews is marvelous as always
B0062NAVXA|5.0|One of the best messages I've seen in a movie in a long time. The story telling is a little heavy handed and the acting isn't always the best. But hey, it is still an engaging, fun, and very inspirational movie.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Lots of fun...Bridget has aged well ! Just enough sadness to make it real but enough fun. Sorry, Bridget, the fun is at your expense but you do have romance.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|I like this app, it's a bit challenging at times and sometimes easy. It may be geared to a younger audience with the graphics but I still enjoy the puzzling aspects of the game in trying to figure out how to put out the various fires on each level. And in some levels you may need to figure out how to put fire with less water. I gave it 4 because the downside is there is no hints on ones you get stuck, although they do let you skip levels that you can't complete.<br /><br />I'm secretly hoping they make a toddler or easier version because my son likes it too, it's just a little to complicated for him to really play and can only play 2 levels.
B00947N6UG|5.0|My kids have watched this movie so many times I lost count.  It is a great holiday movie, but guess what, it does lots of Holidays!! Not to mention Jack Frost and the Sandman this movie is great all year.  I remember reading some bad movie reviews but couldn't understand them, it is definately a classic.  Lets hope they make the rest of them.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks awesome and the kids love the features, pick it up when it's on sale! Gotta love Amazon!
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Going into this movie I was imagining a remake of the classic or even a close parallel, but I was clearly misled. While Dredd offers a similar character base, Stallone is better, but completely alters everything else. It uses gratuitous violence and blood to mask the fact that the future society is based off technology in 1990 Russia.
B007UXT6O6|5.0|Michael Fassbender is amazing often without saying word! The story is remarkable true to it's name. The simple style of the movie made it all the more real. It felt like I was spying on someone's life, seeing his secrets. Watching it unfold was intensely gripping.
0143113100|5.0|I am enjoying this book and wish there will be more experiments to prove what the brain can do to regenerate itself.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|A total feel good movie, with some very sincere drama. It reminded me that getting older will happen, but how I feel about it and what I do with that experience is up to me. It might even be fun.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Classic Steve McQueen at his coolest and the best car chase scene ever. Pay close attention during the car chase because that's Mr. McQueen actually driving the Mustang. Awesome
0307474259|5.0|This book literally changed my life and I can't recommend it enough. It is unlike any other diet/food book I've ever read and I've read a lot! Taubes doesn't give you a specific diet or food plan to follow with recipes like most books. He gives you real information and evidence to change the way you think and empower you to figure out your diet for yourself. After reading this book, I started changing my diet and life. In one year I lost 65 lbs and 6 inches around my waist. I was able to come off my blood pressure medicine.  More importantly, I'm having fun again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun. Very addicting game..wish that you get more lives to use for those of us that are needing them...lol
B0068THAGY|4.0|Great movie, I liked those kids getting into action with these super powers, nice director's work, fun to watch and I really enjoyed.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|I have always loved NBA games, but this one, is the best Kindle game ever...and I mean this to. The graphics were AMAZING for a tablet game! The gameplay is awesome! Everything is just awesome! Can't wait for updates to come out. Worth the cash, the wait, and the pain of learning it! But enough  of me...get this game today!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the challenges, but would rather pay some nominal price for the game than have to wait to regenerate lives.  Would never pay $0.99 to get extra lives, nor would I connect with FB for any reason!
0345456343|5.0|The book cover is different but that is not an issue. I've seen previous reviews where readers received only one of the three books of the serious so I was quite nervous when my package arrived. Thankfully, I received exactly what I ordered, save the cover.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!! This is really my stress reliever. I usually play this game for hours on end. Is there a temple run 3? It needs to be. LOVE, love, love, love, this game.
0684857219|5.0|The book is in excellent condition no marks no folds its worthy what I spent and its one of best books in my collection
B0000CFW87|5.0|MY FAVORITE SINGER.  JOSH GROBAN HAS PERFECT PITCH AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. I TRY TO COLLECT ALL OF HIS MUSIC.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Smart, funny, adorable and the music is fantastic.  Some wonderfully talented people made this film, and it's a movie you can watch numerous times--each time it gets better.  Loved it!
B0042816YK|4.0|I am a Julia Roberts fan and try to watch movies she is in. I try to get all of the cd's she is in.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Keeps me wanting more.  I like the never ending drama of the clients at Lockhart/Gardner and the ongoing triangle with Alica, Peter and Will
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga:<br /><br />I'm addicted to Candy Crush Saga!  So glad Kindle has added it to the app list!  Good job!
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|This is a true point-and-click adventure game. There are no HOGs (once again,  YAY!) The graphics are beautiful,  and I actually left the music on (usually I shut it off if it's too annoying.)<br />This is a game in which you think,  find the items,  and figure out where and how to use them. It's wise to keep a pen and paper handy to jot down a few clues.<br />The length is okay,  although I think we feel all good games could be longer.<br />I play on the Kindle Fire 1st generation,  and had no problems or glitches.<br />This is a game well worth trying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Well thought, exciting and best of all you never see will happen next
0761169253|3.0|I had hoped for more details.  I wanted to know really how to take specific ideas.<br />Fun to read though.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|It's really hard to get past the rap music... It was said it was used to make the story more enjoyable for young audiences.. please!! The music of that era was timeless and has been recorded by artists' since it's conception in the 20s so don't look down on young viewers by limiting their view of the world!<br />Other than that the movie is very good. The cinematography is beautiful and while I'm a HUGE fan of the Robert Redford version of Gatsby, this movie delves more into the book which I enjoyed very much so I do recommend the movie to all... but I still think the music is all wrong.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is addicting and my only complaint is that you often have to pay to advance and the lives take so freaking long to regenerate.... otherwise I'm hooked on this game and I recommend it to all my friends. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waste a lot of time playing this little game. It's a lot of fun and I've never spent a dime on it. You can progress for free if you're patient and persistent. Yes, it will make you stop playing for 20 minutes or so when you lose 5 times in a row, but I actually like that because it forces me to do something else!
B008JFUOVI|5.0|Not sure why a lot of people did like it.  This was a great movie.  Admittedly there was no one being drugged or waking up in unknown places, but the story line was good and the characters were true to form - funny.  Enjoyed watching every minute of it.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Good read for anyone who likes shaking up the status quo.  Bezos continues a long line of retailers who upset the apple cart of those before.  Actually he didn't upset the apple cart he merely provides customers a choice and customers upset the apple cart.  Much like Walmart never forced a local merchant out of business Amazon doesn't either. Customers are present with a choice and they choose what is in their interest.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Enjoy playing candy crush along with my Facebook friends.  Keep adding new levels.  Wish more lives than only five at a time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very Fun and Addicting! Does anyone know how to get a flat note to finish a collection without buying it? THANKS :)
B005NGKLX2|5.0|What a great movie.  I love movies that take their time with character development and showing us the elemental differences between the characters.  Also the cinematography was wonderful and wondrous.  I've never been to South America, so I can only assume they used Bolivia and Chile for that, but in any case it's as beautiful as Costner did with the American west in \\"Dances With Wolves\\".  Shepard is incredible as always as is Stephen Rea and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau did an impressive job as the younger Butch.  I highly recommend it.  It's a movie for those of us who think.
156898443X|5.0|Wonderful diary of art and family struggles through some very tough times.<br />Beautiful work. Unpretentious. Bits of wisdom and insight make this a worthy read.<br />Also makes me want to know the artist better. I've purchased more of his books, based on this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has managed to do what other games have failed to do for me: hold my attention, relax me,  and keep me wanting more. It's a game for the whole family to enjoy! #CantGetEnough
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very cute family movie. It kept my four year old son completely enthralled the entire length of the movie. In addition to holding his attention span, it captivated me. If you enjoy animated family movies, then this is a perfect choice for a family night! I adore the minions!
B00DNDR29I|1.0|Expected it to be less rapp and more soul.  Should have listed to a few cuts before ordering.  Won't make that mistake again!
B008MM9630|5.0|Can not stop playing but no one will friend me on Facebook but still #1 game of  all time Better then farmville LOVE it
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Walking Dead is back and as good as it ever was. Don't even think about watching season 4 if you haven't seen the first 3 seasons. Start from the beginning. You won't regret it.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|strong sounding album, alter bridge's first 3 albums were very good as well. they need to make albums more often.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Awesome storyline. I loved it so much read every book in the series in about a week. Now am so bummed that next book scheduled to come out in fall of NEXT year, :(.<br />Definitely a must along with other 5 books in this series.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd is VERY underrated. All of his music is good. This is a good mix of covers and originals.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hard enough for me to cheat using another interweb device ,but ,it keeps me off street corners (especially as it's getting cold at night time now !)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this! Clues when you're really stuck and great controls! Stunning effects and art work!  Like a click and point but better because with touch screen you rotate the screen. Waiting for The Room Two!
B00005JMYI|5.0|I'm a fan of fine leather bound books, the smell of rich mahogany and a smooth glass of scotch. I have always dreamed of a day when I would find a man with a mustache so full and hair so coiffed that loved the things I do, but I never thought I'd find that man on the San Diego news. Maybe I will meet him some day and we can ride on a rainbow to Pleasure Town.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good games c ha alleging<br />It can be fun but it is really quick.just keep running. Bananas are your friends
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Love love love this movie...this is a really cheap copy but no more so than what you find at major retailers in the bargain bins.  It plays great and that's what counts.  It's a little pricier than I normally pay but this is one of my favorite movies and is actually harder to find around my area.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is exactly what I want it to be. The settings allow for different game play and you have different deal options. The game has very few problems. My only complaint is the ads between deals but that it expected with a free game.
B007ME5BUG|3.0|All in all a good read for beginning students of World War 2. Mostly accurate, although there are some mistakes in it. As an example, the author states that the US carrier USS Franklin was bombed by a regular bomber aircraft off the Japanese home islands during a raid. The truth is that the Franklin was hit by a kamikaze off Okinawa, about 3 months AFTER the author states it occurred.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I absolutey love this move! The action is on a huge scale.Truly amazing in 3d!! I've seen it four times already.
0141442468|2.0|It was not the version we wanted.My daughter originally ordered the larger size hard cover book. When this book arrived she decided to keep it and read it since she ordered it for a book club read. We will have to order the one she wanted later.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It was well written and an enjoyable read. I'm not an expert, but do have some experience on the subject. Dr. Alexander covers most of what has been written about life after death experiences, but it seemed to me to be too highly aligned with popular beliefs. The real red flag went up on his discussion with God on the subject of &#34;evil.&#34; In my understanding of God, there is no such thing as &#34;evil.&#34; Therefore, to give credence to evil coming from God, says to me yes, you had a wonderful life changing experience, but you went just a little bit too far with your imagination.
B008C20TDG|5.0|An easy to understand and follow plan. I miss the milk in my coffee, but I've tried unsweetened almond milk -- it works and I drink far less coffee.  Wish the Hartwigs had put in a few useful eating and cooking ideas.<br /><br />Bought the book because my daughter is using it and having great success.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game rested quietly in my app folder, till one day I played it once.<br /><br />good graphics,<br />excelent sound,<br />fun system, all around great game.<br />That was it. I am hooked!<br />the only thing that annoyed me was the way it leveled up.<br />you would get to the third weapon, and spend A YEAR getting to weapon four.<br />the levels on world three seem to be even more upscaled.<br />i got killed instantly.<br />other than that, it is perfect!
0385486804|1.0|Too depressing .I had to return back to Amazon.I should had known better it would depress me..<br />I feel bad for the young man .I dont understand how horrible it must of been to die like that.<br />May he rest in peace.. this book just was not for me..<br />I have like other Kraukauer books so I thought this one too.Man I was wrong it upset the heck out of me..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite game, love it. Although get frustrated at times! Happy I can now play on my Kindle as well as computer.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Funny, real ,tender...and with a happy ending to boot.  Enjoyed every minute. I highly recommend.  Very well written.  Hope you have plans for a movie and Renee is available.  She is Bridget Jones
B0037UUZQY|4.0|Great doll. Legs don't bend, so be aware of that. Hair is nice and doesn't fall out like some other Rapunzel dolls I've seen. Dress is cute. Great for toddler play, but definitely not for collectors or older children.
1881273156|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I am NOT religious and was leery of getting this book.  But, it had a profound impact on my relationship with, not only my husband, but many people in my family.  It is the first, and only, book I recommend to friends who are struggling with relationship challenges.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Pretty interesting read, particularly if you are into the offbeat. More engaging than I was expecting and the descriptions of the settings, characters, etc., really helped visualize the setting.
006202406X|3.0|So you've probably read a lot of other reviews about this book already so I'll get straight to my point. This book was a lot like the last book in the hunger games trilogy, it had to end somehow and both the authors somewhat sacrificed a lot of what we hold dear in these books to make a point. Yes it is not at all a happy book like the other two before it, yes they are in a very plain and orderly building for the better part of the book (sounds kind of like mocking jay doesn't it?). The characters stop developing and we sides of them that don't make much sense compared to how they were in Divergent and Insurgent. The bottom line is the author was making a point about Government and racism (if that's what you would call it for genetics) and sacrifice although I don't see why it had to end the way it did. So even though it doesn't get the greatest reviews you have to know how it ends right?
B003BLPTB0|5.0|I have be honest and say I find these shoes ugly.  I bought them as bedroom slippers that would be easy on and off.  I found myself not wanting to wear anything else when Im at home.  Then I was doing lawn work, washing my vehicles, power spraying driveway or just hanging out.  They are comfortable with and without socks.  I hosed them down and have gotten drenched.  I've worked on my car and motorcycle.  They remind of the casio g shock Ive had for 17 years...these shoes take a beating.  I may never wear them off my property due to my taste.  I would recommend highly for there comfort and durability.
1451666179|5.0|Loved this book. I bought it because I love Hyberbole and a Half, the blog, and so wanted to support her work. But this book is great on its own. I'll be buying a copy for stocking stuffers and gifts for friends - it's so well done and her stories are so funny, you can read them over and over and laugh just as hard as the first time. I especially love the stories about herself as a little girl. Great book, well worth the purchase. I hope she keeps writing.
0812550706|5.0|I adore Ender's Game. Something about the chemistry of emotion, tenderness, bitterness, and power makes this book very close to perfect, if not that. There's probably nothing I could add to the comments that hasn't already been said; however I must point out that out of most of the child geniuses written about in young literature, Ender is a standout. He's not only smart, but he's strong and oozes common sense, calculated yet gentle. Like most readers, I endlessly sympathise with Ender. I was frustrated when he was frustrated, upset when he was upset, and when he suffered so did I. I wanted for him what he wanted for himself and such a connection to a protagonist is rare. Ender was very easy to care for. Card's writing style was very direct, very clear, and this made the book flow smoothly and further strengthened the connection to the character. There was a straight connection to the characters thoughts and actions. And, of course, the story was flawless and heart-wrenching. Instantly one of my favorite books. A story with such power and emotion is very rare, and Ender's Game is a gem.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This story is one of the best examples of what the true life of someone living with psychological disorders can look like.  It is more accurately portrayed than most films I have seen attempt it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great job bringing history to life with a very engaging family and household. I'm a romance novel reader and even though this was a little past the typical regency era novels I read it was very interesting to see this lifestyle brought to life on screen.
006202406X|1.0|Don't think I've ever been so disappointed by the ending to a book series before.  Allegiant is a terrible slap in the face to true fans of the Divergent saga.  Veronica Roth should realize that her dedicated fans deserve respect and an ending that rewards sticking with the story.  Given that Roth's success is due to her readers, who ultimately enabled her to get a movie deal, this book should have been a tribute to fans, the main characters, and the story itself.  Now I'm not sure I could watch the movies knowing the ending. Not to say that the book had to end perfectly, but it needed to make sense and have purpose.<br /><br />Beyond the storyline, the writing itself seemed pretty weak.  Alternating perspectives on each chapter, between Tris and Four, was a distraction from getting into the story.  Plus, the inner monologue between these two characters is so similar, it requires concentration (and plenty of backtracking) to stay on top of which chapter belongs to whom.  Readers don't want to feel frustrated when reading a book, but rather escape into the storyline. That just wasn't possible with Allegiant.  Honestly, the story felt lazy and dull.  Major characters act so unlike themselves, that you start to dislike the protagonists, as well as the antagonists.  Reading became a slog, rather than exciting and fun.  I nearly gave up several times, but wanted to finish, given my dedication to the series.<br /><br />I loved the first two books and feel completely disappointed and frustrated by the final book.  Unfortunately, I almost wish I'd never read the books at all.  I will not be recommending the series to anyone.  A waste of time.
B000059TFO|5.0|Mississippi Burning is a very good film. With Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe heading up the stars in this film, they bring an honest depiction of their characters. The movie is based on a real-life debacle by the KKK on civil right workers and the FBI's search for the victims.  A must see movie for those who remember or those who want to find out about this era of change.
1582701709|2.0|I bought this for my husband at the recommendation of a friend.  He said it didn't &#34;read well.&#34;  Don't know exactly what that means, but you be your own judge.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Informarional and very interesting and wonderful book I loved this book I finished it in a month I am glad this book came out
B00CXS55LG|5.0|This is great metal. I thought metal was dead in indie, but no. Deafheaven does for metal what Turbonegro did for punk. Revived it with originality and feeling. However dark and f***** up those feelings might be of course.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|its really good if u have a lot of worthless memory its cool it helped get rid of 2.1G without deleting any personal data
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The plot kept me interested throughout the book. Preston knows how to weave a creative novel. I will keep looking for his other books.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|2 issues:<br />1- The extension harness they send with it causes issues, there is freezing of the screen every ~8 seconds with their &#34;wifi signal enhancer&#34; extension.  Unsure if others are having this issue as well.<br />2- It would have received 5 stars if they didn't remove the .AVI functionality from it.  You &#34;Used&#34; to be able to go to your C: C Drive and use Chrome as a file explorer, playing most any format.  They removed the .AVI compatibility with the latest automatic mandatory update.  Until this gets fixed, you are stuck with only support of a few video files.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|a sequel that could stand alone, as beautifully written as the first, eagerly await the last, glad i read it
B0093QIEZA|4.0|This is another movie I had not heard of and the preview grabbed me. In the beginning the special effects for the creature seem very poor (cartoon like). Almost like they added in some near pre-release and did it too quickly, but the rest of the movie is much better than a B movie. I really enjoyed this movie. Who can't like vikings and aliens? There weren't any huge surprises and most of what happens is very expected, but it was still enjoyable. If you like sci-fi you will enjoy this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this calculator app very useful i use it all the time when i'm trying to solve a math problem. Even if you get the free version it still works very well. I hope it's as useful for you as it is for me but i'm sure you will.
B009LDD5E0|2.0|I love Glee, but I gotta say that Season Four of Glee was by far the weakest of the seasons. The storylines were not that great-the songs not too good and while I enjoyed Blake Jenner, I do not like some of the other new characters. It also depresses me that this is the last season that Corey Monteith is in, and also that it was not that great. Don't waste your time or money on this, most of the songs can be watched on youtube.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|i used it twice and now its at the bottom of morten bay only cause I have clumsy feet and kicked it over . But for the time I used it, it seemed to be a pretty good product
B00EKXDVOK|3.0|Just an opinion, but there are some glaring omissions on this one.  I have been a fan since and even before the first Christmas album was released.  In my home, there were compilation albums released by Goodyear that could be purchased at gas stations for $1.00.  They were released by Columbia every year for about 8 years and had highlights from their long list of artists.  Barbra was represented beautifully with her takes on Gounod's Ave Maria and The Lord's Prayer.  The much later release by Barbra called Christmas Memories contained the Schubert version of Ave Maria.  In my opinion, if one wanted to get a taste of what Barbra could do with classic material, these three masterpieces should be the first three considered.  I don't understand why Columbia couldn't take these two sublime albums and release them on one disc called The Classic Christmas Album.  Maybe it's been done and I've missed it. If so, I apologize. My thought is that if you want to listen to a full Streisand Christmas experience with the strongest emotion and the best vocals intact, just purchase the two individual albums and listen away....
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the third time I've read the book and wanted to ensure I reviewed before seeing the new movie out. Each time I've read it it has been a pleasure and is very hard  to put down once you have begun. I suggest reading this before seeing the film as novels are always better than their counterpart.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story telling, hard to put down. Excellently written story that captures your imagination of a plausible event that is scary and riveting.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A seemingly simple tale of a boy's childhood memory draws you into a darker narrative. Neil Gaiman (author of Coraline) probes the deep recesses of a child's fears and creates a magical tale. Well worth the time.
B00640UICA|1.0|Suddenly, out of no where, all my progress in the game reset. Extremely frustrating! I am not happy about it. This is a very fun game with great graphics and sound. I would love to play it and know it won't reset again though.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Not for Kindle fire.  Might work on smartphone or tablet, but not for Kindle Fire!<br /><br />Couldn't go on if you run out of lives.  It makes you wait 30 minutes or more to continue to play on.<br />But it will charge you .99 for additional lives to play.  Who would wait 30 minutes or longer to play it.<br />Deleted it out and moved on to playable games.<br /><br />Not what I was expecting.  Only reached level 14 and couldn't continue on.
1936891026|5.0|All I can say to say to any budding writer, artist, or creative entrepreneur is \\"Read this book!\\" At once inspiring, motivating, demanding, it is a rigorous assessment of how we find ways and reasons not to fulfill our destiny. We all have our stumbling blocks and sometimes we're the ones who put up the most resistance - usually subconscious - to bring our creative efforts to fruition.<br />Funny to admit that I resisted reading this book for several years until I read a blog post by a motivational writer whom I admire, and I stopped procrastinating and picked it up. The section about resistance in particular was like a call to reality. It helped me recognize why and what I'd been resisting, and how to overcome it.<br />Highly motivating and rewarding book.
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Still holds up after all these years.  And the HD makes it crisp so it doesn't look like an old movie.  Sure, the shark looks super fake in some shots but the suspense is still there.
0380715430|1.0|If this book is supposed to be a foray into linguistics and English in particular, it's is doing a terrific job of completely misleading any laymen. Those who take his writing at face value will walk away with misconceptions, myths, and outright misinformation. Bryson demonstrates a profound ignorance of linguistics and languages in general, twisting research and facts to fit into his misguided view of the supposed superiority and uniqueness of the English language. This poorly-researched book carries the real danger of causing a great deal more harm than good to the general view on an academic discipline that is badly understood already.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story kept me up for days. He made up for his fathers murder,gave back to family, both families weren't left out thanks to the judge.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book keep me wanting to read more. It gave a different perspective than we get from the liberal media. It also gives a great picture of the men and women who fight for us and the for the freedom of others. I just heard this is coming out to the movies so can't wait to see it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Excellent introduction of Harry Hole.  Had read his later works and this filled in some of the gaps.  Good read.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Seriously NOT one of the best books of 2013.<br /><br />Started off strong and ended with a fizzle.<br /><br />The elements of a great novel are there, but Hosseini doesn't pull it off this time.  I wanted to love this book, but it fell flat for me.  Too many characters we cared too little about.
B00DB624GS|4.0|Great value for the price.  This album includes all of the tracks from the original UK album, plus the bonus tracks Oh Well (Parts 1 & 2), The Green Manalishi..., and World In Harmony.  I was less familiar with the UK track order than I was with the US version, but after a few listens it sounds just as good.  A great CD to have for any early FM fans, especially considering its absence from iTunes, etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was on my brothers kindle HD when I saw this game I was loved it so much I could not stop playing it soho desided to get it on my kindle never stop playing it.
0316010669|5.0|Thought provoking book to put it mildly - just check out all the reviews - most readers will find their view of how the mind works severely challenged, whether you agree with every thing presented or not. This book was not an International Bestseller for nothing ! Personally, I have learnt to pay more attention to my first impressions - as the cover of my copy notes - \\"you'll never think about thinking in the same way again\\".
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I don't normally give 5 stars because my two favorites, the 1950's version of the Haunting and Ridley Scott's Alien, get 5. Gravity is right in there. There's a moment in this movie that really P me off, and it concerns George Clooney's character. People who have already seen the movie know what I mean by that. Normally when a horror movie does that (and this is a horror movie, I don't care what anyone says) I don't want to watch the rest of it. In the end, I do feel that that element of the movie was necessary, however, and did enhance the plot of the movie. I want to watch this movie over and over. It's a very scary movie!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love the Weather Channel app, although I am not too thrilled with new layout of the main page. The app, however is wonderful giving me all the weather info I need! Thank you!!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Exciting love triangle that will leave eagerly waiting for the conclusion of this phenomenal series. You discover the secrets several of the characters have been hiding. Some William your heart others will leave you with your jaw left on the floor
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|This movie started out to be a winner and turned into one long drag of someone trying to hash out their personal demons in a public forum. I expected to see an ad for the 'faith in god through jesus in the light of holiness church' at the end of it. It started out to be a great movie and spiraled into a blubbering condemnation of drugs and alcohol. Let's just bring back prohibition to force us to not indulge. This is a pro drug war propaganda film.
0316074314|2.0|When you find yourself repeatedly wondering, \\"When is this chapter over?\\"--you have to admit. The book didn't do it for you, i.e. me. At page 290 of 830, I gave up. Clearly wasn't going to engage. Felt like in college when you are forced to read something, you don't want to. Given I have other books at hand that are engaging, gave it up.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|I have the LP but bought the CD when it was finally available. The sound is better than the LP but not compared to the new recordings of today. C6
0062225790|4.0|Unusually for a scientist, Dawkins a fluent and engrossing writer. From his life overseas to English public schools and that ever inscrutable game called, cricket--Dawkins does a grand job of drawing the reader into and through his story.
B00EPH8SBM|5.0|Ya know those fun old movies where the underdog, after much heartache and travail, manages to come from behind and \\"win the big one\\"? Well, this is actually a movie like that... It is based on a real story and it is shot in a real shoe factory, using some of the real craftsmen (and women) who really work there. It is an upbeat movie that stars actors with whom I am not familiar, so it is easy for me to suspend disbelief and totally buy into this thing.<br /><br />The only actor I recognize is Chjwetel Ejiofor, and I can't even pronounce HIS name! He has been in \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" with Audrey Tautou, and \\"Red Dust\\" with Hillary Swank, but I haven't seen either of those. He is a pretty good singer, and he can look pretty good in drag, too! (The comments on the DVD case call his character a \\"sassy, cross-dressing cabaret singer.\\")<br /><br />The story is about an English shoe factory that is over 100 years old. The owner suddenly dies, so his reluctant son and heir is saddled with it. Not only does he NOT want to be there, but he quickly discovers that the factory is on the brink of disaster, as one of it's major clients has just gone into receivership, leaving a massive inventory of men's oxfords. His father had made him work all aspects of production while he was growing up, so he not only knows the work, but he has laboured side-by- side with the very people he now finds it necessary to lay off. (Did'ja notice the King's English spelling of \\"labour?\\" ...nudge, nudge, wink, wink...)<br /><br />What with one thing and another, he desperately clutches at a last straw...making footwear for drag queens, who have been forced to purchase women's shoes, which are...too flimsy...too small...not outrageous enough. Therein lies our tale.<br /><br />The sound track is great fun, from Nina Simone, with her unique little tremolo, to a rousing rendition of \\"These Boots Were Made For Walkin'\\" with Mr. Ejiofor himself doing the honors. It's surprising how many songs there are that have references to shoes, feet and boots!<br /><br />The movie was shot on location in a shoe factory in England, and in Milan, Italy, where the international footwear show is held each year, so you get to travel a little, too.<br /><br />This is no Oscar-winning art piece, it's just a little feel-good flick that makes you smile...<br /><br />I got my DVD from Amazon.com.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Greatly increased the browser speed in my Kindle Fire.<br />I had stopped using the Kindle Fire browser because of speed.
B00G4Q3KOC|4.0|Let's get this out of the way first: Chiwetel Ejiofor is pronounced \\"Chew-eh-tell Edge-ee-oh-for.\\" You will hear it many times during the awards season.<br /><br />Based on his book written in 1854, this best seller told how Solomon Northup, born a free (educated) black man in New York, was abducted in Washington DC, sold into slavery and his travails that followed. For one thing, he had to conceal his literacy or be killed. The screenplay is by John Ridley (\\"Red Tails\\"), with the much-acclaimed Steve McQueen (\\"Shame\\") as director.<br /><br />We have always heard that power corrupts. I would argue that it's the ABUSE of power that is so corrosive, not the power itself. In my opinion, that is what is illustrated here.<br /><br />Look at the cast:<br />  * Chiwetel Ejiofor (\\"Salt\\") is brilliant as Solomon Northup, the fellow whose misfortunes we must watch. This actor, born in England to Nigerian parents, is a terrific chameleon, a master of dialects, and a clever fellow who sang \\"These Boots are Made for Walkin' \\" as a fetching drag queen in \\"Kinky Boots.\\" I'm a big fan.<br />  * Lupita Nyong'o (some TV) is Patsey, a fellow slave, subjected to every demeaning scheme her cruel owners can devise.<br />  * Quvenzhané Wallis (\\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\\") is Northup's daughter Margaret. Her name is pronounced \\"Qua-ven-zhah-nay.\\"<br />  * Michael Fassbender (\\"Prometheus\\") is excellent as Edwin Epps, a slave owner. He illustrates the dehumanizing effects that slavery has on both slaves and their owners. This German-born actor has worked non stop in America in both movies and television since he first appeared in 2001.<br />  * Sarah Paulson (Lots of TV) is his wife, who is every bit as cruel in her own sweet genteel way as her loathsome husband.<br /><br />This has a huge cast, and we see an interesting series of cameos which feature Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, and Paul Dano, to name a few.<br /><br />This is 134 loooong R-rated minutes, with only two teeny scraps of humor, some nudity and far too many bloody whippings. I reached horror overload about halfway in: I saw enough lashings, beatings, hangings, rapes and humiliations to last me a lifetime.<br /><br />This movie is very capably done, both Fassbender and Ejiofor should be short-listed for Academy nominations, but the script itself was a bit of overkill. Sometimes too much brutality is just too much, the audience gets numb. Be warned.... Amazon will advise me when the DVD is available for my JayFlix.net folks.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem gets back to his roots with this album.  The tracks are pretty long but they don't get old.  The beats are truly unique with samples classic rock song creatively mixed together.  A number of the tracks are instantly catchy and I'm sure the others will grow on me once I have a chance to listen a few times.  I haven't really had a chance to listen through a few times and really listen closely, but I can tell this is going to be one of my favorites.  In terms of content, he's really come full circle with his growth as a person and maturity level.  Don't mistake that for not being controversial.  I'm sure the standard groups who get offended at past Slim Shady records will be up in arms about this one too.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked the Slim Shady LP and the original Mashall Mathers LP, then you're bound to love this.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We watched this the other night and both my husband and I had tears in our eyes more than once.  I bought it for a granddaughter who read the book at  her 5th grade class..  A great and sensitive movie for all the family .
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Nice small bag. Fits my SLR, two flashes, three lenses and Garry Fong diffuser. Lots of small pockets for packing other stuff. Sturdy build quality. All the stuff is easy to access because of its simple design. Cant expect more at this price point.<br /><br />Before this I had a small low pro bag that could store only my camera with an attached lens and one flash. It costed more than this bag. It is totally value for money.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It is a nice movie, likes it. I have seen many movies on the same story, but this one was better..liked it..
B00AEFYCDW|3.0|I like the &#34;story&#34; and this movie. It is essentially a road / adventure film with very little end-goal. The side characters Emile Hirsch runs into are the best part of the film's story. For me, the story was about escapism... who doesn't want to give the finger to society and do it all on their own terms? F*** it all right? But it is a movie...<br /><br />I do not like the real life escapades of Chris McCandless... he was not a counter-culture hero. Odds are he was a bi-polar kid with social issues. Anyone that buys into Jon Krakauer's supposed accurate account of McCandless story is as diluted as McCandless. The truth is that he died 18miles from a major highway, was along an old grown over, low maint road (how to do you think a bus got there?) and had no business being in Alaska. We wasn't even in the back country.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is a super fun time! The controls are good and my 8 year old is having a great time working out the logistics of each board.
B00957T6X6|2.0|This rating is PURELY based on the formatting. These books are amazing. READ THEM- even if you've already seen the show, the books answer a lot of questions the show doesn't address.<br /><br />It's difficult to navigate between chapters. In the &#34;Contents&#34; tab, it only shows the 5 books- not the chapters in each book. Then, you have to turn through a bunch of publication pages to get to the particular book's table of contents, which lists the chapters as &#34;Chapter 1, Chapter 2, ..., Chapter 70...,&#34; whereas, once you click the chapter, it takes you to a page with a character's name for the chapter, but no chapter number. It's just hard to keep track of with such a large kindle book file.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|It is so brilliantly acted.  I watched episodes back to back.  I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.
B0049985XW|5.0|It's no secret this movie is fantastic, but every time I see it, I marvel over Walter Huston's performance, as the wise old prospector. Huston is simply incredible, and a standout in a movie filled with truly amazing talent.<br />A must see for film fans and it holds up every time for me.<br /><br />I hope it does for you as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0761169253|5.0|This book has a lot of good information in it, I read it in one sitting! It kept me very interested. I'm a writer and enjoyed this book it rocks it even made me laugh as couple times and gave me some really good ideas on how to crate a regular scheduled for writing to make it a habit.
0143124544|5.0|This is the kind of story that sticks with you after you have finished.  The kinda story that makes you wish the people were real!  A full week after finishing this book I find myself wondering how Louisa is doing.  Did I say that I loved this book? Highly recommended.  Bravo JoJo Moyes!
B00F3YHMUE|5.0|Really different for Sting, but really a good album.  Very eclectic mix of music. The play should be awesome on Broadway.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this book at first but it ended up being so good! I could not put this book down! Definitely read!!!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|WOW. There is not much else to say. I finished this book in just a few short days, I couldn't put it down. I cant wait to start reading the other books in the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the most ridiculous piece of fiction that I've ever attempted to read.  It has no value for the reader , not even in entertainment.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This is a fun game, it's challenging and colorful. However the fact that you have to pay for everything is a huge turnoff. If you want to use a special candy that has been unlocked you have to pay, if you want to play past your allotted lives you have to pay, if you're one jelly away from passing the level and want a couple more moves you have to pay. Then when you finally make it to the area you've been working your way to you can wait three...yes that's right...three days to continue on. That is after completing one allowed quest per day. Or if you want to continue, you'll never guess, oh yep you guessed it,YOU CAN PAY TO KEEP PLAYING! What kind of asinine developer is so desperate for money that they actually prevent you from playing? I refuse to pay but I guess enough of you don't mind. I just think the purchasing options are way out of line here, we should at least be able to earn the bonus candies and lollipops with stars or points or something and waiting three days to move forward makes me want to spend what little free time I have playing something that is much less restrictive. So thank you dev for letting me play through lemonade lake but guess I'll have to find a game that's lets me continue to move forward continuously since that's what most people want to do when they start a game. Too bad, it is really fun. In fact I'd be playing it right now instead of writing this review of they'd let me.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very enjoyable and well written, as expected from this author, I recommend this for fun week end reading.<br />Good ending.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the kind of book I like to read. People I can care about, conflicts, fulfilling ones potential. Plenty of action.<br />I'm not sure if the new movie can do it justice. You live with Ender and share all that he is and wants to be. You live  his life with him, and I for one, enjoyed this book completely. I intend to tell my book loving family and friends that this is one book they will like.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I love all of Gladwell's books, but &#34;David and Goliath&#34; gives all misfits and underdogs hope for their future!  Almost a take on the &#34;Peter Principle&#34; where advantages might just lead to your level of incompetence!  A wonderful Non-Fiction that reads like Fiction because the author points out everyday things or historical events from a different perspective that you never thought of in that way before.
B005MMYPIE|5.0|EVERYONE BUY IT, THIS CD IS FOOKIN AWESOME .  This band is the s***, and this CD is my favorite one. Totally worth the money.
1250012570|5.0|I am so happy to read that Amazon chose this as the best book 2013 for the young adult category!  I loved this book.  I literally couldn't put it down.  I have encouraged my daughter to read it too.  Such a heartwarming story of young love.  The struggles of being teens and the problems some children face!  Life is hard and this book shows all aspects of it.  The JOY and the Heartbreak!!!!<br /><br />Man, just writing this makes me want to read it again!!!!!!!!
B007QA3AH2|4.0|funny, with little twists. Watched with 9, 10, 13 year olds. Some mild cussing, and cleavage shots of Weaver's character.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I think it works pretty well, however, I notice about half the time when I am scrolling through my feed it will go the opposite direction that I am scrolling and I will lose my spot. And when I go to 'like' something it will unlike it sometimes. Other than that it works most of the time. But I wonder how much of it is the app, or how much of it is the actual Kindle itself. Been having problems with our 3 Kindles we own.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|i loved the movie but i hated the ending its not suppose to end like that HOW DARE YOU!!! i need more
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|This season just started but its still good. Its just going to get even better. each episode wants you wanting more.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|not like the book but it was good in its own way i still love the spinning table seen!!! it was super funny
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|Not a lengthy movie... but it felt long.  Several cinematic sequences were drawn out longer than I thought necessary.  My wife and I looked at the clock and realized more than a half an hour had gone by and they still hadn't left for their mission.  Don't get me wrong, I love character development and back story.  I want to get attached to the characters.  Much of the time I felt wasn't spent for that purpose.  Still fun to see where the franchise got it's big screen start and worth watching if you are even a casual fan, just don't expect to be blown away (even by 80s standards).
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|This was part starship trooper, transformers, Independence Day, and Gundam anime come to life all in one movie. Great movie!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Excellent show, with raw action. I honestly could not stop watching until I had finished the whole Season. Starting on Season 4 today!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome everything about it is just amazing  the only thing I don't like  is that you can only get a limited amount of habitats and only one breeding really come on.But other than that Highly recommend it for every gamer and peace.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I did not think this series could be as great as the first season, but whoaaaaa nelly ! It just keeps getting better. Kurt Sutter knows how to pile on the suspense & action. The actors are perfect for this show.
0544002318|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Great stories. Love the recipes. Definitely a page turner. Now I want to read pretty much every book about endurance athletes triumphs and failures. A true reflection of life. Hills and valleys. Plains and plateaus. Great source of motivation and inspiration.

B004S3MB2U|5.0|Excellent calculator. Very intuitive, can calculate just about anything. I haven't even used all the functions, but I love that it can do date and time calculations and works very intuitively at that.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|OMFG who wouldn't love this! It's not my first Gaiman experience by any means but it was by far the best. From transition to excitement to plateau and on through to the refractory period it was exquisite.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Favorite game for the kindle and long campaign so I don't get bored.<br />Only bad thing is that their are ads.
B00EODUWQ6|2.0|I see that my initial response to this tome was scathing in the extreme..,and I am obliged- as always- to ponder whether perhaps my lack of appreciation may in fact have been due to some hitherto undiscovered imperfection in my own perception; and, unlikely as this seems, I therefore withdraw my initial devastating onslaught on this same aforementioned tome.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|I have always enjoyed the story of A Christmas Carol, and I love (traditional hand drawn) animation. This obviously is computer animation and the animation is incredible. However, I was rather disappointed in this version of A Christmas Carol.  To me, it seemed to drag quite a bit to where I was losing interest. (VERY unusual for me!)  The Ghost of Christmas Past was a bit weird, in looks and in speech. I'm not quite sure what effect they were going for here but it did not work for me.  And I'm still trying to figure out why Scrooge was shrunk down to rodent size wtth the Ghost of Christmas past. (Maybe I missed something while I was losing interest as it dragged.)<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't spend too much for the DVD. As much as I enjoy watching (repeatedly) the different versions of A Christmas Carol (and other Christmas movies), this is one I won't be watching over and over. I had heard good things about it but again, was rather disappointed.

B00005JKNC|5.0|Jim Carrey isn't really an actor I respect, although I have enjoyed some of his moviews.  &#34;Peggy Sue Got Married&#34; was the first I remember seeing him in and since he wasn't completely unleashed, I enjoyed his performance.  Offhand, &#34;Liar, Liar&#34; and &#34;Yes Man&#34; were enjoyable and seemed a little more restrained than others like &#34;Mask&#34;, which I hated.  I do, however, have to admit a bit shamefaced that I really like &#34;Dumb and Dumber&#34;.<br /><br />So when &#34;The Majestic&#34; came along, I didn't really know what to expect.  And what happened is that I was completely floored!  Who knew he had such incredible talent and depth as an actor?  I saw this many years ago and last night watched it again.  It was every bit as good as I remembered and had such great supporting actors who added to the feel of the time and place in which the movie was set.<br /><br />My son, who loves Jim Carrey's wackier films, was even very impressed with this movie and with Jim Carrey's ability to pull off a role that required real talent.<br /><br />For me, this movie does for Jim Carrey what &#34;Born on the Fourth of July&#34; did for Tom Cruise.  It showed there was more to the actors than we had previously been exposed to.  We would love to see more like this from him!
B000W21DPM|5.0|At just about every step of the way this album sounds like it is on verge of falling off the edge into oblivion. The songs barely hold together, but that's part of what made it so great. When this album came out I was in high school & every Friday I got to play an album during English class. For weeks I brought albums by groups like Spirit, HP Lovecraft, The Kaleidoscope, the moog album The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds, Soft Machine, etc. It all went well until I brought this album. As the album progressed the teacher went from listening to thinking then acting. By sister Ray he'd decided he'd had enough & threw the entire record player out of classroom door. It was my last time he let me bring a record again. After all these years it can still evoke that kind of reaction upon first listening.Years later at the 10th anniversary reunion I ran across that teacher again. He told me that about 4 years later he ran across the record & actually listened rather than just reacting. He said he realized it was one of the most important records made during the 60s & apologized profusely. This is certainly not an album to approach with any preconceived notions & an open mind is absolutely necessary.  Not for everybody but for some it's almost a religious experience. R.I.P. Lou
1401219268|5.0|Love this version, great book and great to travel with! I like to take care of my stuff and this hard back is great for that.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a very well written and entertaining TV series.  It is fast paced and completely addicting. I am hooked!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|The pace was fast, the story and the actors were great. I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the end.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love this show and re-watching the pilot was great especially where the show is this season.  One of the best shows ever on TV!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As with most google products, this product provides easy setup and amazing functionality. I use mine daily to stream netflix & youtube from my phone, as well as pretty much anything on my laptop. Great alternative for those who don't want to spend $100 on Apple TV but still would like a simple streaming solution. I've had no problems so far and plan to use it for a long time!
B007A4SDCG|3.0|Yet again, a &#34;celebrity writer&#34; tries to tell us his Philosophy Of Success, but succeeds only in telling us how wonderful it is to be (in this case) Steven Pressfield. The book goes from a measured &#34;how I did it&#34; into a fire-and-brimstone sermon, and then recommends some rather superstitious and bizarre ways to &#34;honor the muse&#34; in order to write.<br />He has much to say about all the excuse-making and hurdles anyone has to overcome in order to produce creative work, and this is helpful to an extent.<br />Still, I think I will just go to my office and sit down and write without all the prayers and candles, thanks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can easily identify and connect with the character because her reaction is how I would be. Very entertaining and easily understood.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Like any good science fiction,, this book takes one aspect of modern society and carries it through a logical but extremely disturbing level.  Reading The Circle should give anyone pause to contemplate even the device that contains it.  Is it a boom or a bane for modern society?  A modern Fahrenheit 451 - still one of my favorites.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|It is entertaining but a bit repetitive with every level.it's a good game overall. I just<br /><br />Wish there was more to the game.
B00EVW013E|1.0|One of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.  The writers can only be described as moronic.  You don't expect realism from a movie like this, but you also don't expect the entire thing quite as preposterous as it was.  No one in our family could quite believe that grown men could actually create such an idiotic mess.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Although the game is slow and you run out of diamonds pretty quick, this game is addicting! Can't wait to open more rooms.:)
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great show !  Suspense keeps you wanting and waiting for the next episode !! Can't wait for another season of the walking dead.
B006ZGDC26|5.0|If you like great dance music and more from the 80's, this collection is a must have.  There is not a song you will not like.  This collection is for the music enthusiast.
0316219266|5.0|I did not buy this book from the protagonist’s dot com because it hasn’t acquired sufficient high tech skills to deliver goods to post office box customers in the Age of Amazon.  Had the author mentioned US Postal Service, FedEx SmartPost, UPS SurePost as simple but overlooked alternatives to Amazon’s chronic shipping misfires, I’d give him a 5. Still, the book demystifies the corporate culture that inattentively locks out millions of potential customers.  So the book gets a 5 anyway from this post office box holder.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Of course we love this movie. And you can't beat this deal. We got a BlueRay disc a regular DVD disc (we use that one in the truck) and a digital copy that we can use to put on the tablet and the Ipad. This is awesome deal.
B002Z58GQS|5.0|Great price, nice and compact and more durable than it looks, all in all great buy for the price :)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is exactly what my 8 year old self always wanted in a game. it is a fantastic way to spend a few minutes or an hour.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This plays as it should.  No issue or complaint.<br />Thanks for having it available to entertain.<br />Good card game and format.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It took a long time to get through because it was filled with details and flashbacks.  It illuminated a very complex  international cast of National leaders and politicians.
B00062IDCO|5.0|This show was so great. It was too bad it ended in the seventh season. Some of the best episodes are in this season.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love these books! I have read all of them more than once in the last year. I would definitely recommend!
B000O599ZS|4.0|The quality of the DVD playback was a little sketchy!  Overall veriy satisfied with the movie.  John Wayne is a legend
B00742H26M|3.0|The movie was okay but the connection was terrible.  I had as awful time with the connection to Amazon Prime. The movie must have reloaded twenty times. Three stars for the movie & zero stars for Amazon Prime.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|The book did a great job to bring Ender back into a new world where he can give life to a new species that he previously destroyed. The complexity of the book compelled me to continue reading I almost couldn't put it down once I started.
0553381695|4.0|The second volume of A Song of Ice and Fire continues to be strong, although the story here is a bit more disjointed compared to Game of Thrones. Clash picks up right from the end of the first book, with the North part of the kingdom seceding under Robb Stark, and the late king’s brother Renly claiming the Iron Throne with backing from the South. A new perspective character is introduced in the form of Davos Seaworth, a knight in service of Stannis Baratheon, who also sees the throne as his right. Theon Greyjoy is also added as a main character, as he journeys home to seek counsel with his father, who has plans of his own.<br /><br />A large part of the focus is on King’s Landing, where Tyrion is now serving as Hand of the King, working to clean up the messes of spoiled King Joffrey whilst also looking for ways to stave off the inevitable invasion. The action doesn’t come until near the end of the book, and much more is devoted to the planning, scheming, and alliance making between various sides. The violence, rape, and abuse is still present, but it’s depicted rightfully as horrific and disturbing.<br /><br />Arya’s storyline is among the most interesting, and also among the most horrifying, especially when you remember that she’s only ten. She’s smuggled out of the city successfully disguised as boy joining the Night’s Watch, but her escape falls apart when confronting with raiding parties with no mercy even for children.<br /><br />Jon Snow and Danenerys Targaryen also appear briefly, which is a shame as their stories seem like they should be more significant. Jon has joined a ranging party beyond the wall, seeking the source of the creepy wights and encountering the “wildlings” of the north. Dany, meanwhile, leads her ragtag band across the desert to the city of Qarth. Qarth seems just as real as most of the other places in this world, though it appears rather briefly. The Palace of the Undying in Qarth is fantastically odd and creepy, but ittoo is only a brief setting.<br /><br />More fantastical elements are introduced in the form of skinchangers, people who can enter minds of animals. Bran, back at Winterfell, soon realizes that his dreams give him the perspective of the his direwolf, Summer.<br /><br />More and more characters are introduced, and while this adds to the “realness” of the wordbuilding, it was occasionally hard to keep track of some of the minor characters. The ending has a bunch of cliffhangers as well, along with more deaths; however, this is mostly good stuff that keeps the reader wanting more.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is the first review I have ever written. I wanted to try and save people the heartbreak I have just suffered.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!<br /><br />Ok, first of all how could you just kill off Tris in such a meaningless way?? The whole story line there was FULL of flaws. There were so many things that could have been done to make this book great! But it was like every time Roth stumbled across a path of narrative genius headed in the right direction she jumped ship and went somewhere completely confusing with it!<br /><br />Also, I was very excited to see how Tris and Tobias progressed in this book but there was nothing. Yeah so they figured out they loved each other. We knew that in the second book. In this book we found out that we just keep hurting the people we love but we continue to love them anyways.<br /><br />I didnt like the way Roth changed between points of view. It was confusing most of the time because their voices were EXACTLY the same! I was very disappointed in the the way Tobias left Tris knowing how self sacrificing she is and expected her not to take the place of her brother.<br /><br />The killing off of other beloved characters for stupid reasons (Tori killed and not thought of again, Uriah dying for simply standing in the wrong spot at the wrong time, etc.) Was completely devastating!! You cant let readers get attached to so many characters and then rip them all from us in the end!<br /><br />I loved the first two books but if i were you i wouldnt even waste my time with this book. I am very disappointed and will go on with my own alternate ending to these books because i cannot believe how they turned out. No way will i be going to see these movies when they are released. I feel bad for the actors/actresses who were cast to play what should have been career starting characters but have been robbed of that chance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really entertaining and can last me a lifetime.I could spend hours at a time playing this game and now I will never get bored in trips.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|At first this was the best music app I've ever had! But recently it's been skipping over songs and not playing anything at all. So I looked up what to do, and it said nothing about my situation, so I tried deleting it several times I also tried getting the unlocked but that didn't work, so I deleted every trace of this app off of my kindle fire. I'd like for the creators to fix this problem so I can once again enjoy my music :) thanks I hope this encourages or discourages your decision on getting this app.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I thought this was a very helpful app it allows you to be able to record vids which I thought was very helpful that I could make video s about anything I wanted I give this app 5stars
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Movie alone is funny and comedy for those of you who like comedy. Its dark but not too dark for the audience.
0316074314|2.0|While the writing is often deft and engaging, the characters are thin at best and the plot too preciously conceived. I have no desire or obligation to finish this book, and will happily hand it on to someone else.
1400069742|5.0|A good story well researched and well told.  Ms. Olson not only is a fine historian but a gifted writer as well..
B0084HJE0S|4.0|This book is a good overview of the technology of HTML5 and the possibilities it engenders.  It's not a tutorial, even a basic one, but more of a marketing brochure for what HTML5 can do.  Some of it I didn't understand, as I'm a beginner in this field, but it is intriguing nonetheless.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim is the best documentary I have ever watched about the strange creatures that live deep in the sea.  THUMBS UP!
1623650003|5.0|This novel was originally written in French but you would never know it. The translation by Frank Wynne is superb. The novel begins with a rather gory kidnapping which goes bizarrely wrong. However this is no ordinary kidnapping and this is no run of the mill crime novel.<br /><br />'Alex' has more aliases than she has had hot dinners and is no stranger to wrong doing herself. She is pursued by Camille Verboeven from the 'Brigade Criminelle' which is the murder squad. Camille, himself, has a past - a famous artist mother, recently deceased, to whom he owes his small stature due to her inability to stop smoking during pregnancy and a wife who was herself kidnapped and killed whilst pregnant. He is assisted by Divisionnaire Le Guen and also Armand.<br /><br />All of the characters are cleverly drawn although Alex herself remains an enigma for much of the novel. Only towards the end do we gain an insight into what her early family life was like as we are introduced to the woman she calls 'The Queen Mother' and her brother, Thomas.<br /><br />This novel has as many murders as an episode of Taggert and the plot is played out slowly with more twists and turns than a roller coaster. It is all done very skilfully and I defy even the most seasoned crime reader to guess the ending which is a superb climax. If you love puzzles and cliff hangers then you will enjoy Alex.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|Star Trek: The Original Series  brought to you by Desilu.  The second season of too few in my opinion.  Well worth the price of amazon prime for every Star Trek: Ever.  IMHO.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was thrilled when this game 1st showed on Kindle. But once you move into board 100+ each board really turns into a crapshoot, unless you want to buy boosters.  The fun trails off.<br /><br />I would recommend Fruit Quest, also available on the Kindle. It features nearly identical play, with an alternative BONUS scheme, less reliant on real-money.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have already recommended this book to many friends.  I was born into and raised in a Christian tradition, and that included accepting everything written in the the Bible as accurate and--somehow--completely applicable to the modern day.  But I've always suspected that the historical context was important to understanding the significance of the events of the Jesus story.  This book provides that context, discussing people and events within their appropriate historical setting.  It clarified many, many things for me.  I don't re-read many books, but I will be reading this one again.  I have never provided an Amazon review before, but this book needs to be shared.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is fast and easy way to watch whatever I want from netflix or stream my music from Pandora.  I highly recommend it...i even turned my cable off because I didnt need it anymore!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|My sister RAVED about this movie and said it was her very favorite (now).  It was good but, unlike my sister, I couldn't get overly excited about it. But it was very good and enjoyable.  There were parts that I really did enjoy.  Good movie.
B00F2HW220|4.0|I am unsure if this latest offering from Arjen Lucassen’s Ayreon will appeal to the majority of his followers. The Theory of Everything seems to align itself with &#34;The Human Equation&#34;. It is based on a human story rather than science fiction. The same as with “The Human Equation”, there is no narrator. The music itself tells the story. Personally, I never liked narration; don’t see a need for it. For me, narration tends to get in the way and interrupts the flow of the music. I thought there was too much in the “Magic Castle”. Therefore, TToE appeals to me.<br /><br />TToE moves rapidly. Even though the album is broken into four 20 minute + chapters, the longest single track (for lack of a better term) is only 3:54, many barely clock in at 2 minutes, and there are 42 of them! (A tip of the hat to Douglas Adams) This keeps the work rapidly moving along and keeps this listener from getting mired down in a lengthy segment. Owing to these short segments TToE moves rapidly carrying the listener right along with it. One does not have to wait impatiently for a long segment to end but in contrast is almost hurried along to the next segment. This helps the story to unfold not unlike a fast paced movie.<br /><br />This may not appeal to everyone. While there is a musical theme that reoccurs throughout the piece, there are virtually no verse-chorus-verse types of songs here. The very short segments may make the work seem choppy to some listeners. TToE seems to be written to be listened to as a complete work, in one sitting.  At a minimum it appears to anticipate that you must listen to at least 20 minutes of it in one sitting. DO NOT make the mistake I did and purchase the MP3 download. This creates 42 breaks in the music and will drive you nuts. (Hey old schoolers out there: remember the annoying middle of the song breaks on old 8-track tapes? Imagine 42 of them.) I corrected the problem by burning them to a CD and eliminating all the breaks. I could have saved a lot of effort if I just bought the CD in the first place!<br /><br />As usual guest musicians are aplenty with Rick Wakeman handing a good bit of the keyboard duties and Ed Warby on drums with solos by the likes of Steve Hackett, Jordon Rudess and Keith Emerson, to name but a few. Arjen has chosen to use mostly relatively unknown vocalists, at least to me, but the vocals could not be better paired with the characters they represent, and all are devastatingly powerful!<br /><br />The music is varied with a good metal edge to it.  It moves at a blistering pace which gives the music an added sense of urgency. Troy Donockley’s whistles and uilleann pipes, (a type of bagpipe) along with Jeroen Goossens flutes and woodwinds create what I would call a folk metal prog sound to some of the segments. Very cool! Arjen’s multi-instrument musicianship is as stellar as always.<br /><br />I have to consider that this work may not appeal as strongly to everyone has Ayreon works of the past, so I will verbally give it a strong 3.5 stars and therefore kick it up to 4 stars on the chart.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I had heard good things about this movie but wasn't really sure what to expect.  It was a very nice/fun movie. Cute concept. I did find the (rock) music a bit annoying (hence the 4 star rating) but most people would probably think it was great.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I couldn't stop thinking about it during and several days and nights after reading book. There were so many messages to process.  It left an impression on me.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|If you love the movies, you will love the series.  The characters in the movies are portrayed by different people in the series, but the choices were well thought out.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Love the history of Muscle Shoals!  It's cool to learn how some of these old tunes got recorded.  Great Music!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first book was great. The story was intriguing (although the writing was not fantastic). The second book was just OK. I don't remember if I even finished it. This book is very bad. As other reviewers have written: there is *no* character development here. Everything said is formulaic. If I have to read one more terrible approximation of a love line, I'll cry.<br />Full disclosure: I am on page 30, and it has been a struggle to get this far. I will probably try to finish it because I paid for it, but I will wait until I am stranded somewhere with no wifi options and nothing else to read.<br />Yes, this has some similarities to *The Hunger Games* (including a less-than-stellar third book), but that series is infinitely better.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I was stuck somewhere with no wifi options and nothing else to read, so I finished the book. After I pushed past the worst section, it got a tiny bit better - at least to the point that I wanted to finish. I understand why people are upset about the ending, but I am just glad it is definitively over.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Best Stryper Album EVER!!! they did a AWSOME jod there in not ONE bad song ALL sound AWESOME!!!!!!! BEST EVER!!!!!!!

B002RKRV4Y|5.0|I have read this book many times, at different stages of life, and there is always something more, something deeper. Read it, and look past some of the awkward sentence structure of the translation to find wisdom time after time.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|A fresh fun CD from this magnificent vocalist. Adam Lambert is a terrific showman  but it is his vocal depth that makes him a star. His voice is both powerful and tender  as he shows his range in the songs here. He just keeps getting better and better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just started playing today, but it seems like a decent game. Certainly worth the price! It's free, so what have you got to lose?
B00957T6X6|5.0|Kindle version - wi-fi download, I dont know how long it took because I started it and went to bed. All the books were there, the maps at the beginning of each have a pdf format link so that you can download them to your device seperatly if you want to. Of course the books themselves are awesome!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I like Big Fish and I am very to see that they are working with Amazon to bring games to Kindle. These games can be a lot of fun and they are easy to play on the touch screen.  The only thing I don't like is being asked to sign into Facebook all the time.  Facebook has not learned yet how to play well with Kindle.
B00G32VYDG|5.0|My husband and I thouroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Some really funny parts and it was also very touching. Enjoy!
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|Meaningless dragging of the movie makes you wonder where is the start and when would this be done! Better movies in similar category exist..
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Perfect size for 14.5 or 18.5 inch kettles.  Long handle with heat shield to keep the heat down.  Starts charcoal just as fast as the larger one.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hate it. It seems awesome at first but then it says Thank you for playing the free version if you want to continue please buy the full version. And I'm like no way this is stupid. I am going to delete this app at once.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Superb app, clear, attractive, and very much at home on my kindle. I could not be without it, it just makes it more welcoming.
B004LAIU4I|4.0|I like this record, but I don't love it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first track uses a right-left fade technique that makes the song unlistenable from the &#34;sweet spot&#34; of a stereo system.  It's fine in the car, or in a room full of people, but if you're getting the full stereo, the effect will drive you crazy.  Usually I love Phil Ramone's production, but I have no idea why he made that choice.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a good listen, with some great rhythms and lyrics, but for me it's not at the top of his work.  However, I realize that such judgments depend entirely on personal taste and what you like best about an artist.<br /><br />If you like Paul Simon, you won't be disappointed, I'll say that.  Definitely worth having, and I'm sure I'll come back to this record often, and for many years.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|I imagine there are two kinds of potential purchaser for this 47-CD collection of all Bob Dylan's official releases, including live albums but excluding the Bootleg Series (which perhaps will form the basis for a future Complete Collection Two). One will be the person who has discovered a liking for Dylan and will grab the chance to get a comprehensive collection at a decent price. The other will be the enthusiast who has to have everything. There is something here for both, though the enthusiast will be getting a lot that they have already.<br /><br />The box itself is smart, solid, and surprisingly compact considering the number of CDs it contains. Each CD is in a cardboard slipcase with the original album artwork, but without any printed inner sleeves. The double albums are gatefold but annoyingly the opening for the CDs is on the inner fold making them awkward to remove.<br /><br />You also get a bonus double CD called Side Tracks which collects the extra tracks released on compilations like Greatest Hits 2 and 3, and Biograph.<br /><br />Finally there is a high quality 270-page book which has the original sleeve notes and song-by-song band credits, supplemented by photos some of which are previously unseen, and finishing with a 43-page album by album commentary by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin.<br /><br />A few words first for the more casual purchaser. While 47 CDs must seem like a lot of Dylan, personally I think it is worth it. There is nobody like Bob Dylan and his words and vocal delivery move me like few other artists. His career is full of changes too. Here, you get the acoustic folk of the first few albums, the revolutionary Sixties electric albums, the sublime poetry of Blonde on Blonde, the pain and emotion of Blood on the Tracks, the anger and energy of the Hard Rain live album, the Christian fervour of Slow Train Coming and Saved, the back-to-roots folk of Good as I Been to You and World Gone Wrong,  and stunning later works like Time out of Mindand Modern Times.<br /><br />Nobody would pretend that everything is equally great; but everything here is authentically Dylan; and somehow even low points like Dylan and the Dead and oddities like Christmas in the Heart are worth hearing.<br /><br />But what if you have everything or nearly everything already? Well, not only do you get a nice book, but also the long out of print Dylan album; admittedly this one was put out by Columbia without his consent after he temporarily deserted the label in 1974, but it is still an entertaining listen.<br /><br />There's nothing really new on Side Tracks, but it makes a nice compilation and of course most of the material is fantastic. I have some quibbles though. I would rather have had the Big Band version of George Jackson, which is not easily available, and which is horribly distorted on the Masterpieces collection, than the acoustic version which is here. Or preferably both.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that there are many more tracks that have appeared on official releases but are NOT included on Side Tracks, such as Band of the Hand, a 12-inch single, the orchestral Great Music Experience tracks from Japan, and other live rarities which appeared on official CD singles. Let's hope they appear on the next volume of \\"Complete Collection\\".<br /><br />What about the mastering? The Dylan mastering story goes something like this. There were the originally released CDs mostly done in the Eighties. Then in 2003 Sony/Columbia issued a 16-album collection on high resolution and in some cases surround-sound SACD. Around this time, the standard CD releases were replaced by new masters based on the SACDs where available, though of course in standard CD resolution. In the years that followed some but not all of the albums not released on SACD also received new mastering, including the Basement Tapes, New Morning, Before the Flood, and Dylan and the Dead.<br /><br />Based on what I can tell so far, you get the most recent remasters in this set, in most cases digitally identical to what was already on sale - confirmed by AccurateRip which checks against previous CD rips. However there are some CDs that had never been remastered. Therefore there are 14 CDs here which are newly remastered. They are, I think, as follows:<br /><br />Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid<br />Dylan<br />Street Legal<br />Saved<br />Shot of Love<br />Empire Burlesque<br />Knocked Out Loaded<br />Down in the Groove<br />Under the Red Sky<br />Good as I Been to You<br />World Gone Wrong<br />Hard Rain<br />Bob Dylan at Budokan<br />Real Live<br /><br />Of course these are in general the less celebrated releases, which is why they have been neglected until now, but in principle it is good to have them remastered at last - though I'm not convinced they always sound better than the older ones. Shot of Love just seems a little louder and very slightly clipped, not so good. In addition, Self Portrait will be a new remaster to you unless you picked up the recent Another Self Portrait set which has the same remaster, though without the slight glitch on Copper Kettle that affects the first press of Another Self Portrait.<br /><br />Street Legal is an oddity. This has been not only remastered but remixed in the past. However this release is the original mix, which is curiously murky and lacks clarity compared to the remix, but I'm guessing sounds more as the artist intended. It is remastered which does in this case improve on the original CD (yes, I have all three, I am embarrassed to admit).<br /><br />Overall it is a nicely done set and an unhesitating five stars for those who have none or only a few of these releases already. You are in for a treat.<br /><br />What if you do have most of this already? Is it worth it for the box, the book, the Dylan CD, and 14 remasters? That is an individual choice, but for such a person it is hardly good value.<br /><br />NOTE: In the first batch of boxes there is a flaw in the remastered Hard Rain, song Oh Sister, small digital skips at around 0.8 minutes/seconds and 3.53 (this one more noticeable). If you are able to load the song into an audio editor, you can more or less fix it by deleting the obvious gaps in the recording when zoomed in close. However I'm happy to say that Sony replaced my defective CD free of charge.<br /><br />Appendix: here is the track listing for Side Tracks, since it is not currently listed in Amazon's description:<br /><br />Baby, I'm in the mood for you (Freewheelin' outtake)<br />Mixed up confusion (Single)<br />Tomorrow is a long time (Live 63)<br />Lay Down your Weary Tune (Times outtake)<br />Percy's Song (Times outtake)<br />I'll keep it with mine (Bringing it all back home outtake)<br />Can you please crawl out your window (Single)<br />Positively 4th St (Highway 61 outtake)<br />Jet Pilot (Biograph)<br />I Wanna be your lover (Biograph)<br />I Don't Believe You (Live 66, Biograph)<br />Visions of Johanna (Live 66, Biograph)<br />Quinn the Eskimo (Basement Tapes outtake, Biograph)<br />Watching the River Flow (Single)<br />When I paint my masterpiece (Greatest Hits 2 performance)<br />Down in the Flood (Greatest Hits 2 performance)<br />I Shall be Released (Greatest Hits 2 performance)<br />You Ain't Going Nowhere (Greatest Hits 2 performance)<br />George Jackson (Acoustic, single)<br />Forever Young (demo, Biograph)<br />You're a Big Girl Now (Blood on the tracks outtake, Biograph)<br />Up to me (Blood on the tracks outtake, Biograph)<br />Abandoned Love (Deire outtake, Biograph)<br />Isis (Live 75, Biograph)<br />Romance in Durango (Live 75, Biograph)<br />Caribbean Wind (Shot of love outtake, Biograph)<br />Heart of Mine (Live 81, Biograph)<br />Series of Dreams (Oh Mercy outtake, Greatest Hits 3)<br />Dignity (Oh Mercy outtake, Dylan red box)<br />Things Have Changed (Wonder Boys soundtrack)
B0039TD826|5.0|Note: This is a review of the remaster, not the \\"deluxe edition\\"....<br /><br />This record IS rock and roll.  Sure, yeah, I know, it's not the \\"roots\\" of rock and roll, but it's what fifties rock grew up to be.<br /><br />It's all here, all the influences, from blues to country to honky-tonk to boogie-woogie to gospel, you name it.<br /><br />Keith Richards said of this record that he \\"was no longer interested in hitting number one in the charts every time... if it's good they'll get it some time down the road.\\"  Mick liked it a bit less because he felt the production values weren't up to snuff, having been recorded in Keith's basement during their tax exile in France, overdubbed in LA, and mixed and mastered by a bunch of \\"drunks and junkies\\".  But hey, this is rock and roll -- sometimes the scars make it better.<br /><br />And in this case, I can't argue with the result.  And the remaster has been beautifully handled.<br /><br />I can't imagine not having this record.  It's one I can listen to almost anytime, and I go back to it time and again.  This is rock and roll at its best.  No other record tops it.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you don't like this record, you don't like rock.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I was expecting more from the story after reading the reviews. Didn't like this book; I had to force myself to finish it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|To me, Beggars Banquet kicks off the best era of the Rolling Stones' music, from this album in 1968, on through Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and their tour de force Exile on Main Street in 1972.  Perhaps only Some Girls in 1978 rivals their work on these records.<br /><br />Beggars Banquet was amazingly risky, diving headlong into not only American blues, which had always influenced them, but also American country music as well, taking it at times almost to the point of parody.  But boy, did it work!<br /><br />In a way, it's two albums blended together.  On the one hand, there are the country-influenced tunes -- &#34;No Expectations&#34;, &#34;Dear Doctor&#34;, &#34;Prodigal Son&#34;, and &#34;Factory Girl&#34;.  On the other hand, there are the classic Stones-sound tunes -- &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34;, &#34;Parachute Woman&#34;, &#34;Jigsaw Puzzle&#34;, &#34;Street Fighting Man&#34;, &#34;Stray Cat Blues&#34;, and &#34;Salt of the Earth&#34;.  But they work so great together.<br /><br />There are only two perennial hits from this record, &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34; and &#34;Street Fighting Man&#34;, but like Exile on Main Street, all the tracks are great even if you won't hear most of them on the radio.<br /><br />The mastering by Bob Ludwig is, as usual, stellar.  When I turned on &#34;Street Fighting Man&#34;, it was like hearing it again for the first time.  Love the way Charlie's drums come through so forceful and clean on this disc (the 2002 remaster).<br /><br />Hey, if you like rock and roll, you can't be without this one.  It's that simple.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a captivating story from page one and held my interest throughout.  Some of the experiences were so ordinary but the inter- twining of the story kept it fascinating.  I particularly liked the thought provoking wrap up.<br />Unlike any other story i've read and very satisfying.  Every life is filled with mystery and what may seem common is not at all. Who ever knows what our lives might  have been?
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|It is a good app I guess. It was not to bad. It helped me get slot of apps that o could not.
1476734941|5.0|I'm down 22 pounds as of this morning.  Started in September 2013.  I love this plan.  I have a collection of books on the 5:2 plan.  Love the book and the plan.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|i work from home and i play alot of music to keep the hours moving smoothly. this is perfect for keeping me working and not noticing time going by. anyone familiar with music from this part of the world will know the style. this isn't sing-along music, but rather mood music. my husband finds it kind of mournful, but i don't feel it that way!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I never played this game before so I gave it 1star but I think its going to be good so see ya lata
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Me my dad and my bros all like it  it is awesome  it is fun it is cool  o yaya
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin once again delivers a powerful ending.  I was angry at the end of the end of the book.  This is a good thing Martin gets you to form a connection with the characters and when you finish you simply must know what will happen in the next book.
B00493SIIA|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Everyone should be required to read this in college.  Why is there not more education out there about this topic?
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Though I can't say I really liked the main character; I found her selfish, self centered and egotistical, I loved the book!  It opened my eyes to race issues in America; how we Americans are perceived.  I love America and the author has a lot of disdain for it...how our children behave; our accent, our lingo.  All the same, it opened my eyes and the writing was beautiful.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|A fun challenging game for me (gramma) and the kids. Improves eye hand coordination for the little ones. You won't be disappointed
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great season so far. This year had all the potential of a geriatric prison farm, yet it's been fairly fast paced with some great cliff hangers. Keep it going!<br /><br />OH and HD on my PC monitor. WOW. Close up and personal. Excellent media.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Real rock and roll is hard to find in 2013 but I will tell you that Stryper's \\"No More Hell To Pay\\" somehow manages to sound current and classic at the same time. From the opener \\"Revelation\\" to the closer \\"Renewed\\" the listener is in for a heavy and melodic ride. There's very little wasted space and it sounds great on every system I've played it on! The packaging is also a treat for fans and great value for the money. In short: Buy it!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Fun to play and realistic action, keep updating the weapons. Love the variety of weapons snd actions. Easy to use
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its for my grandchildren they seem to like playing it. it seems like a really good game for my grandchildren
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|I would have given it 5stars but having to hit the re-shuffle button SOOOOO many times in one game was as annoying.  :-(  disappointed especially since it was not free.  Not sure if can be fixed ... I hope so.
B0013O123Q|4.0|Life is same and insecure everywhere. Whether you are in a emerging nation or an established nation. Movies are woven mostly from real world experiences.
B007QJBJ76|3.0|This movie starts strong, with solid character development, a great soundtrack, and is shot in visually interesting locations. John Houseman's ghost story at the beginning is a great touch. Unfortunately, though there's a great build-up, the end just doesn't come together into what I expect from a film in this genre. Also, Carpenter really should have found a way to use John Houseman further on the film.
B00000IBVC|5.0|I’ve seen multiple performances of this opera and this is how Puccini intended it to be. The staging and costuming are perfect, the quality of singing is almost perfect and the acting is very good.<br /><br /> I don’t understand why, on several occasions, we were treated to repeated views of Chinese architecture, stone statuary or other Chinese art, as they did not seem to have any relevance, to the storyline or action. Some of the photography was a bit sloppy, in that, in some of the long views, we were “treated” to views of the offstage lighting fixtures.<br /><br /> The only disappointment, if one can really call it that, is that they sang the shorter version of Nessun Dorma.<br /><br /> Aside from that, this performance deserves 5 stars.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This app was working fine, but after the last update to version 1.1.8 it no longer syncs with Google Tasks properly.  When I try to do a manual sync I get the following error message:  \\"Full synchronization error, please try again later\\".  Please fix this as soon as possible.  Thanks.<br /><br />Update:  It appears that if you re-select the Google account that you want this App to use from within the App's Settings, then Full synchronization will complete successfully.  Before re-selecting my same account, I did backup my database to the SD card (from the Maintenance menu) just in case something went awry.<br />Changed initial rating from 2 stars to 4 stars.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|this album completely exceeded my expectations. After the amazing Goodbye Lullaby I never thought Avril could top that but with this album she definitely has.  Literally, EVERY song on the album is amazing I couldn't be happier w/ this purchase!!
0142420891|4.0|If you haven't read If I Stay yet, then don't read any further. I must say this book grabbed me from the start. The POV from Adam is so good, and the whole story line itself is amazing. Adam decides to watch Mia's concert one evening. After the concert Adam is asked to go backstage at Mia's request. From then on the two of them spend the night around NYC and think of the past they share. During this part of the book it's likes these two never went apart, that everything seem in place. When the ending rolls around, you won't be very shocked when Adam leaves Bryn for the one he is meant to be with. There is no doubt that Adam and Mia are perfect for each other, and deserve to have the life they are meant to have. This book gets 4.5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so much fun!  Just can't put this game down.  I f you are looking for a fun challenging game., candy crush is it!  enjoy
0062060554|5.0|Don't let anyone tell you anything about the storyline so you can appreciate how it unfolds.  Just let them tell you this is a book worth reading.  I read it over a year ago and the story still haunts me.  The writing brings the story to life and you can't put it down until you have finished the entire book.
B005X3SB8W|5.0|If its still going strong after more than a hundred years there is not much more<br />praise I can thing of to say. Listened to this book and that really put the icing on.
B00DCRE7W0|5.0|Should get a Grammy ! What a great metal LP. This rocks hard! I have the LP and the CD. Great items.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Bought this for my husband because he is obsessed with this show.  It was a great price and a birthday gift for him.  He was very pleased.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|The case I received seems a used one, several scratches on the clear back.  my new iphone 5s looks like scratch on the back.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son ist really into Minecraft and Legos so this was the perfect combination.  He loved it! He wants to get the other sets now.
