B000V63CI0|5.0|Great songwriting, great performances by Meat Loaf, and gorgeous production values make this album a classic.  Go beyond the huge radio hit that opens the album, and you will be rewarded.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Love all of Owl City's stuff, and this album is right up there with the others. Adam does it again! :)
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like the quality of the sound loops and having more available online is a plus.  Subtracted one star because I would like to be able to delete sounds I don't want, such as vacuum, hair dryer, etc...
0694003611|5.0|I had lots of memories with this book with my mom as a little girl. Excited to share similar memories with my little girl now too :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the trilogy in a short amount of time, but my heart is still beating fast from the fear of what could happen when the government we trust to take care of us goes completely corrupt. These are wonderfully written and impossible to put down!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I deleted it -  I found that it didn't match with the fun that I had playing the various Angry Birds games
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a much better way to do jigsaw puzzles than the traditional boxed puzzle -- you can never lose pieces! You can choose the number of pieces in the puzzle, which affects the difficulty. The app itself and some puzzle sets are free; you can pay for a larger variety of sets. Reasons it does not get 5 stars: you can't look at all the puzzles in a set before getting it (as far as I can tell), and at least in the sets I got (free sets) there were only 2 puzzles in each set. I'd also like to be able to go up to even more pieces for more difficulty
B0090YHSFC|5.0|as you move through the levels, it gets tougher.  But it is fun to see how long it takes to get through it.  I still haven't finished 2 of the levels
B000SW4DXK|5.0|We have the VHS version of this movie, but I wanted the DVD version since VCR's are hard to find anymore.  We just love this movie.  It is one of our favorite Christmas movies.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I found Subway Surfers to be a simple and mindlessly fun  game.  But it hasn't really drawn me in enough to open it up again
B008RA3X5E|3.0|after have using the free clock I upgraded how ever since the up grade it don't work all this week it hes not worked from what I read it did not have to be open to work that's a lie so at night I open the app and leave it open just to find Ny kindel has not charged a bit intact it was drained then today the clock was all messed up
B008NABUU8|2.0|I found Bridge Constructor not very captivating.  While is can be challenging as you move up levels, it wasn't for me
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great show, great acting, great plots and the scenery is always so beautiful.  I consider it a real gift that my Amazon Prime membership includes this.
B00913DPW2|5.0|fun and challenging.  Finding the puzzle pieces and putting together the puzzle is the fun part.  Solving the actual puzzles and finding the &#34;key&#34; to them is the challenging part
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|why do you need an account to make notes and why does it need all my personal info, saying it sucks would be kind!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter and I saw this movie in the movie theater and absolutely loved it so I had to buy it for the house. Characters are well thought out and storyline entertaining. Great movie!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|amazing!!!! game wast your time you get to breed dragons and they combine into another dragon u should get it its a realy fun game
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Christopher nolan has done it once again, delivering a dark story to the batman series,This is by far the best batman movie i have seen in a long time, Tom hardy who plays bane does it so well, you may not see any expression on him with that mask, but his eyes deliver the attitude very well, almost showing a maniacal man, Now there are some things i did not like about the film, The ending was left on a cliff hanger and left room for a sequel, but as far as i have heard, Christopher nolan said he wasn't going to do another one. So hopefully he changed his mind or it will be picked up by someone else. But despite that it was still a great film.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|First off I'm going to say that Ultraviolet isn't perfect but it's not worth all the hate from reviews on here.  I've had great success using Flixster on plane trips to watch my dozen or so movies in My Collection without any issues.  Now it does have draw backs as in you need to make sure you connected to the internet in Flixster before putting that iPad into airplane mode because every two weeks your account is logged off for security reasons and you need to be logged in to view your movies.  You take that code you get with the movie and enter it online in your account then you can stream it anywhere from any device or you can downlowd it right to the device to take with you on trips.  I keep a dozen movies downloaded right to Flixster and iTunes My Videos all the time just in case I get bored somewhere.  Now as for The Dark Knight Rises, it's fairly awesome with a great storyline and gripping action scenes!  The whole trilogy is a great ride and worth owning on Blu-Ray if you can!
B005KJZDXK|3.0|I've always enjoyed M. Ward, but never got into She & Him, but when I saw they did a Christmas record, i had to check it out.  Zooey's voice does justice to quite a few of these songs, but her limited range leaves some to be desired.  I really think the arrangements could have been more lavish.  The duets are great!  I did three stars, not because I feel the release is horrible,  but because it could have been more memorable.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I like stories that move along without too much description. This one had just enough description and dialogue to keep things moving.<br />Also liked to humor sprinkled in. It was a fun read. Didn't tax your brain or make you work too hard to get through it.
B009682EFQ|4.0|This record has the feel of Neurosis' Relapse years.  Give it a listen and i'm sure you'll find something on this record you like.
B000FC12SM|2.0|it had a few good points - but a lot of stuff was repeated.  Some of the stuff was a JOKE.
B0098G7AWS|5.0|It's dicaprio and winslet. What else needs to be said. Those two can do anything. When there together its gold.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|`Gabriella' starts excitingly as it means to go on. Titillations lace with humour hold the reader's keen interest from start to finish. The antics of the sexy Gabriella provide entertainment and amusement - and her antics are complemented by those of her rich and eccentric parents, Mummy and Daddy Blenkinsop, who are always at her beck and call.<br />She is by far the strongest character in the book and has everyone in it running around to do her bidding, sexual or otherwise.<br />Chivers, the stereotypical long suffering butler is always on hand to sort things out - and keep her liberally supplied with alcohol and cocaine - although he is abruptly told to `piss off' for his pains.<br />The story centres around the game of cricket at St. Swithin's school. Cricket was never like this when I was at school, more's the pity! Bouncing red balls all over the place! I will never be able to look at a cricket bat or ball again without thinking about this book, and smiling.<br />Gabriella's involvement with Jim - one of the `yobbos' she despises changes her, and yet still provides her with yet another excuse to go without her knickers on every other page.  This really is an excellent and very funny adventure that deserves to be read, probably more than once.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|merry Xmas to me!McHughMcHugh huh high cc sheet huh no ok kg c had xxx th UK k f2f f2f
1449410243|1.0|I love cat books of all kinds.  &#34;How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You&#34; is Not funny.  Not even mildly amusing.  The drawings are not even funny.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I Like the product but do not like the pop up ads that occur every time I play the game.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|This is not one of Yul Bryners better movies but it is a good B Movie. The plot is good and does not need any more special effects.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|how could you not love it? do you hear the bell? bought several times for grandkids and myself..don't miss this.
B0043X1FOK|4.0|This is a fairly good movie but not as good as the original. Could have used more of the original actors in it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love Supernatural I hope it never goes off the air.. All my shows are leaving me but this has got to be top 5
B0024FADAQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie again. The plot is good and moves along real well. For a B movie it is pretty good.
B0068VZNGG|5.0|In the store this album is 2 times more. Great Price. Over the years I've lost a lot of cd's. This put my fave's all on one. =)
0767812166|3.0|While watching this movie I remembered seeing it before.With no real action the movie gets a little boring. I fell asleep watching it.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Wow, what a brilliant boy!  I had no idea so many electronic things are interchangable.  This was a very interesting book and I was cheering for his success.  Well written and inspiring.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Wanted to be able to connect to my bluetooth speakers I have a Ipod Nano 4th generation so its not the newest but it certainly works for me.  I plugged this little baby in boom my bluetooth speakers came on line.  Real easy.  Then I plugged in my home stereo system using the audio in/out auxiliary line and it came on at the same time.  So I can hear the wired system in the living room and use the bluetooth in the kitchen with out having to crank the wired system up.  win win here
B009SQOGZ2|3.0|This is an okay movie.  It is cute in some parts, somewhat suspenseful in others, but not really funny.  The one thing I really did like about the movie was the zombies themselves.  They were actually sympathetic towards the end.  I say all of this from the perspective of an adult who still enjoys cartoons.  If I were a kid, I probably would have really enjoyed this.  Definitely not for kids under the age of 5.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I was somewhat excited to buy this book as I enjoyed the rest of the series. I must say that my strong feelings were slowly slipping away by the time I began to read this book.  GRRM owes his loyal fans much more than he is giving. If he doesn't produce a better product on the next book in what? The next couple of years maybe longer. I won't buy it.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This movie is so violent that it is unwatchable.  I enjoy ware movies and some of my favorites are considered by others to be extremely violent so I can watch almost anything but this movie is way too much!
B00338QENI|5.0|We read it last month and everyone really liked it a lot!  Good story, especially if you live/work in the Baltimore area, and I learned a lot about science and cells, which I would normally run from.  Wonderful writing!
145210655X|5.0|We are big fans of Star Wars.  This fit the bill of a quality product to introduce young children to it.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Awesome price for such an awesome movie! Got this for my girls for christmas. I know they're are going to be so excited! The price was excellent for so much that this movie comes with. This is a must have!
0439023491|5.0|I ordered the book for my daughter and she when we received it we were happy to see it was a hard cover and also not a bad price.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I must say I was surprised with both the quality and story line of this movie. Well done for sure!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a nice fun game to play casually, haven't put real money in it yet but for a free game I might as well drop a few bucks for it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Ever since I downloaded this app I haven't Been late for school. I go to a Catholic school so their really strict. Good job creator!  P.S I love Harry Styles &lt;3 #directioner
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book. The author's unique style of writing grabbed me from the beginning. l  cared about Cathy from the start and loved being inside her brain throughout.  Being an avid reader forever, it is wonderful to find a new author that had me so captivated all the way to the end.  The last time I was so excited about an auhor, was years ago when I read my first Lisa Gardner book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I bought this 4-disc combo package because it was at great price at the time. I went ahead and downloaded all the free stuff and even got the free poster (after paying S&H). I would not recommend the poster however, took a month to get the thing was tiny. Other than, this is a great deal and a great movie.
B009O2XY12|2.0|frustrating can't start new game.  was fun to play until I got stuck . I don't want to purchase additionall tokens to play.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Some of the chapters includes very obscure language... maybe britons have an easier time reading it... I bought it only to read it before the movie comes out... not sure if it was a good idea now...
0446530573|5.0|Great cook book. Very simple recipes with things you probably have on hand. Even if you don't cook its a good read great pictures.
0061998494|5.0|Easy read, funny, thoughtful, self effacing, tender and hard to put down. I admire this man and would be proud if he was my brother. I want to get the other book he wrote.... Hey Santa!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Like this game a lot. Keeps you busy and is very cute and interesting. Can't wait until the new movie is out! Very glad this game app is in here!
B0009V971S|1.0|This was a total disaster the battery that was shipped never fit the phone it was made for.<br />Thank God this phone service is long gone
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This mic is super cool its long, comes with its own battery, and the quality is better than what you pay for.<br />But I really have a hard time keeping the wind filter on. Every time I take it out I'm scared i might lose it and it was hard to adjust the right gain but maybe its just my camera. My final problem is that you really have no idea if its on or not unless you test the video first. there is no led that shows if its on or off. An example would be that it took me a good 2 hours trying to figure if it was broken or not there was no sound being produced when i did the playback.<br />Turned out I put the battery in the wrong way :/ other than those things this mic is great if you don't wanna spend to much. I'd recommend this to my low budget video makers ( But if you have the money to get a better/ more expensive mic do it)<br />GREAT BUY!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game.  I feel challenged each time I play.  This is a great game to build on being alert and recognizing differences and items that are identical.
0765317389|5.0|This is a GREAT book.  It tends to be polarizing in the sense that some will hate it.  But if you're open to possibilities -- the essence of science fiction -- then this will be fantastic.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Disney is the master at turning a fantasy into something that seems possible. Life in the jungle with wild animals who aren’t threatening makes for happy entertaining. Its a kid’s level story but an adult can’t avoid the impact of the catchy songs. And the actors chosen for their voices seem perfectly matched to the characters.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|So many things I love about the app, that I can only list the cons to this application, the biggest one being that in order to get all the ponys in the game you have to either play this app for the next 20 years, or spend a couple thousand dollars to get them all...
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This set is a must have for any BSG fan!  I would highly recommend buying this set. This is the best show ever.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a fan of V Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  If you want to see what happens next for Mitch, you have to read this next installment.  I can't wait to see what happens next!
B007HO392S|5.0|I can't stand it. My wife loves it though. Carrie Underwood has a beautiful voice, I just am tired of every time I get in her car hearing this CD over and over again.
B000088E6P|4.0|Not the fault of the seller, but the album is missing the song &#34;heat&#34;. For some reason it wasn't on this copy. Wierd. Maybe it being edited, there wasn't much of the lyrics left.
B008COD5OO|4.0|I can't remember if I paid $3.99 for it or it was free on Amazon prime, but either way it was worth a watch. Couple of good scenes, typical teen comedy.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Even though it doesn't include Adele, it is a comprehensive overview of every Bond flick,including some interesting extras and incidental music.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|fun game once I was able to get going. wandered around clueless till I realized there are 2 (TWO)  rooms off the kitchen (one is hiding on the right side with no door)  puzzles aren't real challenging but fun to play. I hate the games where you have to check a walkthrough for every scene. luckily this is not one of those.
B007RTAR64|4.0|This doll was a little pricey and I am told it doesn't look very much like Katniss.  Obviously, it looks like a Barbie doll, but I think my 8 year old granddaughter will love it.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|no way do I want something with this many &quot;permissions&quot; constantly running on my device. funny that as soon as a 1 star review is posted a fake 5 star review is quickly added to cancel it out.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|The movies may not be the most expensive productions of films but they just give enjoyment to RE fans. I would have to say give them a chance they might not be spot on like the games but it's little elements from the games.
1401324649|5.0|This book was hilarious.  Absolutely hilarious.  Like a Swedish Forst Gump.  I think my Dad liked it even more than I did,  he couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|there's not much to say about it other than pinterest is a great website and i love having an app avail for it now on my kindle and phone...it's awesome having it to pass the time and great great ideas for just about anything!
B00881VLCE|5.0|so much fun! forgot how much I enjoyed putting puzzles together! Better than the old days no storage or lose of pieces.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|this movie left one guessing what batman was really about. there was a bunch of story strands flying around unlike the previous movies. i think another thing missing from this movie was the great action scenes that were in the other two.
B009OA57MI|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!! You can create your own missions and if you get the whole game you can get multiple planes.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I find this book entertaining but very put-downable. The characters are amusing but the author seems to be standing on a separate planet, looking down at them, laughing at them. Actually, I did put the book down about three weeks ago and haven't gone back. The atmosphere is kind of mean.
B001EJV276|5.0|felt like watching it and looked on amaozno fast and easy to grab it and watch holds up very well.
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|The best band in the history of rock n roll never sounded better. LP has full sound of all the instrumentation. Can even identify harmony singers. Digital like listening on boom box. music so compressed hard to tell all the instruments and individual voices. I all buy LP over CD or digital download whenever possible
B004PLT3TY|4.0|This is definitely one of my favorite super hero movies. It's fun and it's just visually appealing. I thought the story was pretty well written, considering it's a movie geared towards a younger crowd. The acting was pretty good as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is perfect for all ages because some of the games are easy and some of them are hard.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This Deluxe Edition is just great! Best Christina's record till now!! Army of me is my favorite song of this CD...
B0037LXTUW|5.0|All this expansion does is add a bunch more cards to the mix, which is great as my group of friends typically goes through the original Dixit Odyssey deck pretty quickly. I would totally recommend buying this expansion. The artwork is by the same artist as the original Dixit/Odyssey and the style matches flawlessly. Very bizarre/surreal pictures - I love just looking at the artwork. I think this is a must have if you bought the original game.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I think that it would be safe to say that all of us have that dream or ambition that is always before us--something that we've always wanted to accomplish. Doubtless, many may never see that dream come to fruition or so it may seem. UP embodies this reality but also touches on the fact that the real adventures in life may just be those things that we take for granted, from day to day, and the people that mean much to us. I highly recommend watching this film for the bigger picture of the story line.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Ridley Scott has once again updated the sci-fi film-he is still ahead of the curve! Adventurous in substance and style!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This movie was an excellent display of wonderful animation with a thoughtful message. A great family flick that sends the message that regardless of our preferred religious backgrounds, we need to stop living in the digital delusion that so many of us call &#34;life&#34;, and take an active role in being responsible for this planet we are privileged to inhabit. I may not be the &#34;Go Green&#34; guy that some folks want everyone in the world to be, but one thing is for sure...I do grow some of my own food. It's a start.
B0086213XW|2.0|Michele Williams turns in a nuanced performance, however, Seth Rogen love him or hate him is always Seth Rogen. I think this film misses the mark due to the lack of a credible agonist / antagonist which undermines the cadence and credibility of this film. She is in actuality torn be between two drones yet we are to believe sparks are flying? The trouble is no chemistry. It may be that the scripted characters were 2-D cut outs or possibly the actors brought no heft to their roles( I suspect a little of both)  The female lead is reacting to dead space as though she were a mime and in the end you are left feeling that for all of her struggle there simply was nothing to be gained. It feels quirky, yet ultimately incongruent and unsatisfying....and lonnng. In the dead of space no one can hear your angst.
B008J34466|5.0|Her best album yet!  Every song is good and it feels like she's singing about your own personal experiences!  Love it!
B004K00NMG|4.0|Its great!  It looks excellent on blu-ray and the sound is superb.  Well done in all respects.  Well done animation.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|It's a great Album!  It's definitely up there with &#34;Stripped&#34;!!!  Really loved her duet with Blake Shelton and Ceeloo Green!
0061906220|5.0|my 5 yr. old daughter loves this story.  her pre K teacher even turned it into a play.  so enjoyable by all.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Once again Amazon cannot be beat.  Always the best selection in music and I am a lover of all except Hard Rock and offensive lyrics.  You cannot be disappointed with Whitney Houston, well only becvause I would have liked to buy all of her cds.  However, totally pleased with this one which adds to my collection.  Of course you also cannot be disappointed with Amazon's price, speed delivery.  I always buy my music from Amazon because they always have what I want at great prices  Rita Simone, Milford, Ct.
B0013F1D02|3.0|The Story itself is excellent. BUT the picture quality of this bluray disk is at best as good as DVD.
B008M87GJK|5.0|No fluff just straight forward news. I would Highly recommend this for true news followers. Much better than anything in the USA.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Looking for a good, clean, action movie... this is it. Love this movie. Not a 'kids' movie, but teenagers love it. All characters are GOOD people and fight for the right. Love the Avengers.
B004SMD4H2|5.0|Love this series and if you google the Novia Scotia town it is set in you really get a great coorlation....I have both Standard and BLURAY...I like this one mostly because the quality of the  sound is SO MUCH BETTER.
B005ZUR724|5.0|omg this game looks great it also looks like world of warcraft but that only works on a computer and its rad
B001TH16DI|5.0|Star Trek from since day one....so I Love this series ....I have both Standard and BLURAY...I like this one mostly because the quality of the  sound is SO MUCH BETTER.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Why did I like this movie?  Let me count the ways.  1.  The cast.  These are the best of the best in the profession of movies and stage performances.  2.  The location.  India with all the colors and noise is the best place to bring this movie home.  Finally the story.  I think all of us of a certain age would love to just drop everything and go on an adventure.  It is what more movies should be made of.  Love, adventure and showing the world different cultures in a positive light.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I have really gotten into this series and the Bluray version is really good. Well worth the purchase if you do not have this series.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|it's way smaller then i thout it was. but the knifes i did sharpen it with, it made them really sharp. if it came in a bigger size i will get more but it will only work on very skinny knives. no thick ones or ones with all those small cuts in them by the blade.
0547884591|5.0|The 4 Hour Chef is fantastic. I recommend it for anyone who wants to squeeze as much as possible out of life. Like Tim's other books, it offers simple, proven tips that actually work. It's entertaining, interesting, & helpful.
B007P3TMW2|3.0|I rarely like the movie better than the book, but this was one of those times. It was easier to follow and while the performances of all involved was good, I guess the subject matter made it difficult for me to enjoy it. I didn't know 9/11 has impacted me that much.
B008EQIA7W|3.0|This movie wasn't bad for being a sequel. The special effects and CGI were awesome (especially in HD), but the plot was a little lacking, and the end was a little corny.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|At the very beginning of the movie as the camera moves in on the hands of a very old woman reaching for cheese in a market, I was hooked. I wasn't sure at first that this old lady was Meryl Streep once I saw her. The film never let of me, ever. I don't know how much was true about Mrs. Thatcher and how much was &#34;Hollywood&#34;, but I was very entertained by the movie.
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|This movie was great. At first I didn't have high hopes for it, because there isn't a really well known cast in it, but the plot was great, there's a twist at the end, and the whole concept was plausible (you'll understand when you watch it - I thought the guy was a super hero, but that's not the case). Would buy this movie to own.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I am so glad that I bought this CD.  The vocals and song selections are amazing.  This CD is a standout in my opinion!!!
B0012TWRAO|4.0|This product was very easy to mount, and offers two different sizes of U-shaped connectors. It works perfectly with my IPX4 Waterproof Case for Galaxy Note & Note 2 phones.
1594744769|4.0|This book was very interesting for young adults! The pictures were cool and the story was definitely engaging and fun for young adults!
B008CP93S0|4.0|This movie is very funny. It's a little out there in terms of how the people portrayed in the movie live, but well worth a watch (not really a movie for kids).
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Uhg, such a catchy song! I listened to this all summer and know all of the words. It's impossible to get out of my head!
B009VB7QQA|3.0|This movie is better than I thought it would be. It's a little lengthy but a decent movie all in all.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought this as a gift. Exactly what was needed. Has Ultra Violet download codes. You get what you pay for here!
B007SSDS24|4.0|Great movie, great concept. Plot was a little lacking. Special effects and CGI were great. A little rushed in parts, but overall a good film.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|love it i like all the season of ncis and since i dont have tv it helps that i can watch these quickly
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This was a good movie. Not exactly as good as the first one in my opinion, but still a good movie.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|saw original when i was a kid and i love how they did the updated version<br />i watch this and will watch more
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was awesome. Great CGI and special effects, great cast, and great story line. Wasn't sure how it was all going to come together (what with all the different super heros), but was not disappointed at all. Great movie for kids and adults alike.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|love it since i dont have regular tv i love watch this season and other season anytime i want<br />highly recommend if you like cop show with a military twist
B0088TG252|4.0|This was a pretty decent movie. Denzel doesn't disappoint (rarely does), and the movie is action packed, with a good plot. Not a movie for kids.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Very good read. Not as good as The name of the Wind but gulped it just as quick.<br />The writing is very careful and you can see Patrick puts a lot of time and effort into filling the universe (songs and all). The only thing I would point out is that he abuses on Deus Ex Machina solutions (specially on the love story)<br />Be advised book 3 is not out yet .
B0083GPDBO|5.0|What can I say except &#34;I Love This Movie&#34;!!!. Great concept, completely original plot, insane special effects (looks so real and characters actions are completely realistic), and for being a movie in the style of the blaire witch (i.e.; from a third person camera view), was not disappointed. Would buy this movie to own.
145210655X|5.0|Everything is so relatable. The perfect gift for any father or child. It's always the first book people pick up in my office.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|I loved the first three movies, but this one was a bit of a let down. Seemed rushed, plot was lacking, and whoever did Kate's makeup should be slapped (she was hot in the first 2, but looked like an old hag in this one).
B001RXB4FY|5.0|This cd is awesome. Filled with Volbeats unique music, never to disappoint. Good price and arrived quickly. Glad I purchased it.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This movie was a bit long, and didn't really have a great plot. At the end, everyone who watched it with me was still wondering what the point was.
1419705849|5.0|I love these books.  My daughter reads them out loud to me and we both laugh.  The illustrations are wonderful.  A+
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|I like the movie because it kept it real.  I purchased two copies to give one to an acquaintance of mine that needed to see it very badly, hoping to change their life around.  They enjoyed the movie & said they saw the mistakes they have been making in the past and can't continue living like that.  They are changing their life style because of the movie,<br /><br />I love the movie because it kept it real.  I purchased two movies to give one to my acquaintance that needed to see it.  He enjoyed the movie because he was able to see himself in it and the mistakes he made in the past.  The movie, Walk The Line changed his lifestyle.
B005PK553C|5.0|I was confused for about 7 episodes HAHAHA! But it was so damm addicting to watch because I wanted to UNDERSTAND wtf is going on!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excellent product. 5 blurays and lots of extras, including a documentary of all the bat mobiles, which i found really interesting, the quality of the IMAX is mind blowing, and in the dark knight rises there are a lot more than in the dark knight, amazing, unboxing here: [...]
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is like those big desk calculators.  Nothing special, but it does have a nice clean interface.  If you just need a simple calculator this will do.
0811879542|1.0|I actually laughed when I opened this book. My 2 1/2 yr. old is pretty bright and likes looking at books. She gave this one about 1 minute and walked away. That is all I can say.<br /><br />Either I grossly misunderstood the description of this book or I was misled by the glowing reviews. Either way, I threw it in the garbage.
B0086700CM|4.0|My 10 year old son loves this game.  A good little game that can eat away a few minutes every day.  Good graphics, and responsive.
B0033AX1YG|5.0|I was a fan of Gary Moore for years. Finding this DVD of him was a wonderful experience of his music. I felt like I was in the audience listening. Please check it out you will not be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10 year old boy and 6 year old girl play this all the time.  It would be awesome if they could get it to hook up with LAN games.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game has its glitches but what game doesn't. I like O&amp;C because it isn't overloaded with people to the point you're drowning in people of an unkind disposition. It is definitely worth the price. Not needing a super fast computer also makes the game worth it. Why would I want to spend hundreds of dollars upgrading my computer just to have the new hardware be obsolete in a year or with the next expansion? Definitely a great game. kcco
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|While simple this case isn't &#34;cheap&#34;.  Stand works well, hugs the body of the Kindle so it doesn't add much to its size.  If you want a simple, non-intrusive case, get this one.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This does not work.  Took it off because it didn't do what it claimed to do.  Now it has been sitting in my game drawer.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Pretty solid app.  Moves quick on my Kindle Fire.  I'm not a huge facebook user, but it does more than what I need it to.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie serves as great family entertainment along with the purpose of teaching us how to respect our environment with it's resources.
B002OG5GT8|3.0|Works great but the hinge that is used to clip the Amp comes loose and the spring comes off and can be lost.  Other than that it's been great
B007MDB6L0|1.0|My daughter has the other Tinkerbell movies and I really liked how they were done. I especially liked that tinker belle had friends that were boys but they weren't pushing relationship stuff on them. This movie seems like one big romance story with most of the characters having &#34;loves and crushes on cute guys&#34; and Tink is asked if Terrance is her boyfriend. It felt more like a money maker than a story line with actual thought put into it.

0547884591|4.0|I enjoyed the [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich (Expanded and Updated)]] which was Tim's first book which is why I bought this one.<br /><br />Let me first say I don't cook nor do I ever really plan to cook.  And no offense to Tim but I don't think I would enjoy the vast majority of the things he likes and vice versa when it comes to food.<br /><br />And that I think is the true value of this book.  This book is so large and big that almost anyone can find value in it.  Tim himself suggests you skip over things that won't interest you.  Which is rare for an author to say.<br /><br />The best thing I can say to people considering buying this book is the following.<br />1. If you are considering it you should buy it.  Most people who come upon this book will know enough about this book to consider it.<br />2. If you bought either of Tim's other books you should buy this one.  While some like myself may only have one or the other of his first two this one works well as a follow up to either.  This may be why at times it seems like you are reading two or three different books.<br />3. If you have a desire to learn to cook buy this book.  While I don't personally want that I can tell this book will teach you to.  When I have \\"cooked\\" in my life it was very much about being simple and \\"feeling\\" the food.  And I also agree with him that you should learn each taste before putting them together.  I love food but have no real desire to cook for myself.<br /><br />One final note: I bought the Kindle version and based on that I would suggest when possible get the physical version.  I believe this is a book that does not lend itself well to digital and Tim himself has said that before I believe.<br /><br />Score: 4/5<br />Good book but nore a great book.  Most people will find value in it especially those already considering buying it.

0425263908|1.0|This book is absolutely THE WORST book I have ever read! First of all, I suppose all ideas of originality have gone out the window. This book is so much like FSoG that it is infuriating! What I loved about FSoG I absolutely HATE about this imposter of a book. While FSoG was hot and steamy, it also had a pretty good plot and just enough mystery to make you wonder what exactly Christian's deal was. Bared to you is raunchy, unbelievable and I could give two craps about the characters. I feel not one ounce of sympathy for either of them!<br /><br />This coming from a woman who hasn't even broken page 100 yet and I could care less that this review may be premature. I will not waste another minute of my precious time reading FSoG all over again but... not. I mean come on! That's what she is trying to do. Ride the coat tail of a 50 million sold trilogy! Ugh. Just tasteless! Every page I read made me roll my eyes because something Gideon or Eva has done was so much like Ana or Christian. It was borderline embarrassing!<br /><br />Ms. Day, The fact that you even had the nerve to THANK E.L. James in your acknowledgement section further shows me that you are clueless. This failed duplication of a great (although poorly written) novel is not worth paying $10 for. Spend your time doing something that won't leave you feeling like a complete idiot!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and do not complete this trilogy Ms. Day! I'd almost feel bad for you, if I didn't dislike you so much right now!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to the saga. Did not want to wait after reading Book 1 and 2 back-to-back so I downloaded this and was on my way. Could switch back and forth from my iPhone and iPad, it always kept my place in the book. Highly recommend e-book download if you are as engrossed as I am.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I can't stop playing this. Its totally addicting and a great distraction when I'm stuck in waiting rooms or long lines! I can also play with my cousin who lives 5 time zones away so its cool I can share this fun game with him.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I am very pleased to have access to this app. It's very easy to use and has been very helpful.  It's been wonderful to use in reading the classics and finding words that are rarely in use today.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like the game, but it has a few issues. I will download new puzzles, play one, come back and they are gone. And sometimes they won't download. I lost 5 or 6 sets today and have to start over. The puzzle portion works well and I love playing it. Would love it more if it would not lose my download.
B00966TN1Q|3.0|I love Michael Connelly, and have pretty much read everything he's written.  I give this three stars simply because it started out well and then feels like it ran out of steam.  The denouement at the villain's house was kind of feeble, and one never really got a sense of the bad guys.  Having said that, Harry Bosch, even on a bad day, knocks spots off most other fictional protagonists and I will read anything that Connelly writes.
0060730552|5.0|If this book were fiction, I would have put it down on page 100 and cried out how ridiculously unbelievable it was. I would have rated it one star and moved on with my life. However, Joe Simpson showed an audience that survival is something of a funny thing, and assumption is not to be trifled with. I usually reserve five stars for classics, but I am of the stature that this book will become a classic beyond its cult status.<br /><br />I am not here to give away the book, nor its musings. However, Joe Simpson tells a tale that has nestled its way into climbing folklore. Unfortunately he had to. Joe Simpson had spotted the challenging climb of Siula Grande - a mountain which had never been summited -  in the Andean Mountains from an airplane. He ringed a compatriate climber Simon Yates to tell him it would be, \\"...a challenging day out.\\" Plans fell into place and the legend is set in motion.<br /><br />There were three people on the mountain throughout the ordeal, yet it is Simon and Joe on whom we focus. Flash forward and it is Joe who is clinging to dear life. Joe had broken his leg quite high up on Siula Grande, typically a death sentence for any climber. Simon sticks around doing his best to aid in the rescue of his partner knowing the nearest town is certainly out of reach for a successful rescue attempt.<br /><br />It is Joe's perseverance that keeps him alive through the ordeal (obviously I have left out numerous facts). The admirable part about him laughing as he finally breaks the surface of the snow shows his uncanny ability to admit, \\"What else could be thrown at me?\\" Joe continues on in pursuit of the ultimate survival situation. He obviously succeeds since he is the one writing the book.<br /><br />His purpose of writing this nearly unbelievable tale is to exonerate his climbing partner. Simon Yates had been shunned by the climbing community because of his desperate actions on the climb. The Mount Everest Foundation would not admit him on the account that they felt he was untrustworthy. Joe Simpson found this ludicrous and felt the need to set the record straight - he even admits at some level to saying he would have done likewise.<br /><br />This book is a must read. Simon is a remarkable author who tells a tale that is so far beyond belief that a reader must put the book down at times to review the facts. The reader will  then resume only to be sucked back into Joe's story daring him to show one false fact about the ordeal. Joe does not disappoint the reader though - there is no falsity in his tale. The reader will be forever changed to feel like s/he will never match his struggle to survive. Simon Yates said it best in the movie adaptation of this story when he stated (and I'm paraphrasing) that we have so much control over life, and we live in very safe environments. Simon and Joe are the example of people who move outside of the safe box of life, only they came away with a phenomenal story. I cannot recommend this book enough, and I hope it becomes the stuff of classics.<br /><br />Joe Simpson captures the struggle and the triumph over the desire to succeed. How far would one of us go in Joe's situation? To be a passenger on Joe's journey could very well change the perspective one would have on life. Joe should not have survived and it is his explanation that makes us realize that he is the ultimate survivalist.
B004AKCME8|3.0|It was a little hard to follow, but we bought it for the grandchildren and I'm sure they will have no trouble following it.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|1. The awful 1990's era mastering has been scraped off, like barnacles hiding a beautiful old ship, revealing mixes of panoramic scope and breathtaking depth. MC&TIS now sounds like a lost 70's epic. Everything sounds live, warm, and crackling with energy.<br /><br />2. The three discs of outtakes are crammed with great material. Highlights for me: Tonite Tonite strings-only track; Methuselah, a lost track; Medallia of the Gray Skies remaster; 1979 demo; 33 demo; Porcelina live demo; Thru The Eyes of Ruby acoustic demo and live band demo; Cupid De Locke remix; Mellon Collie Theme home piano demo. It's all good stuff, interesting, rare, or cleaned up boolteg material sounding great for the first time.<br /><br />Well worth the money.

B008YJFDQK|5.0|This features some of Ben's thoughtful and laid back selections from various releases through his career, excellent choices every one, a very nice collection. He is an amazing talent, and this cd reflects much of his genius as a songwriter, singer and musician.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I'm a Grisham fan.  I haven't read it yet, but I like all of his books.  He is my favorite author.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|My little girl loves Merida.  She keeps telling me that she wants to hold her.  I am so happy that I found a doll.  I think this movie is very sweet.  It is about the strength of a mother's love and the determination and independence of her daughter.  I think we watch this movie six times a week.  The music is very nice.  The animation is fantastic.  I purchased the instant download after watching it on demand from directv.  I wish it had the special features that are included with the dvd.  I do recommend this movie.
0316228532|3.0|I loved the books Rolling wrote previously but Casual Vacancy was a disapointment for me.  It seemed to go on and on without a purpose.  To much information for me almost boring in detail.  I was really surprised.
0140186409|5.0|Steinbeck was a master of narrative. His descriptions are often raw and extremely breathtaking. I am in love with this book and with the Joads.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excellent movie with great special effects.  The story line was well written and the acting was also excellent.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  This is a great package deal.
B001EC3JME|5.0|This flashlight holster is great, works prefect for my application and I have already recommended it to several of my friends.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Decent action, but the plot was a little thin.  Enjoyable to watch, but not worth the $3.99 rental fee.  I would recommend this movie if it were cheaper.
B009E3EY38|4.0|I agree with others who have noted that some of the aesthetic qualities of this movie are questionable.  Notwithstanding, the performance is terrific, and it is a real pleasure to watch these men doing a fantastic job of doing what they do best:  being Led Zeppelin.  The music is superb, and the quality of the audio sets new standards for concert films.  (If you don't have a Blu Ray player, I suggest that now would be a good time to buy one so that you can fully appreciate this film's sound.)  For those of you who have casually enjoyed Led Zeppelin's recorded music but didn't understand what all the fuss was about over the band's live performances, this movie will be a revelation to you.  These songs are played with authoritative skill and dominating talent by musicians who are at the top of their game.  Not to be missed.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Arrived earlier that expected.  No damage.  Great Price.  That I need to type 12 more words is why I generally don't do these reviews

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I did like the movie but there was holes, how come everyone didn't know he was batman. And was that guy really robin? Other wise a lot of great action.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not an avid reader.  But I am cheap.  So I was looking for a cheap book to read, and this had some good reviews.  So I tried it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It sucked me in with the first couple pages.

B00984668E|5.0|The Sword have cemented themselves, surprisingly, to me at least, as a genre leader in the world of heavy metal.  Their shows are sold out, and their fans are legion - I'm so thrilled for them and honestly did not see it coming.  This record will continue their climb.  Warp Riders (their last release) was an outstanding album, and is still probably my favorite overall, but Apocryphon sure does come close.  Honestly I was underwhelmed after one listen - probably because there isn't as much new here as I'd hoped for.  Warp Riders was a really cool step into the world of 70's bluesy hard rock and was quite progressive in parts - a sort of modern sci-fi, arty take on Thin Lizzy and ZZ Top (interestingly it's this album that includes a \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" bonus cover).  Apocryphon is more like their first album, Age of Winters - tons of Sabbath worship and open string riffing - but those tools are being used to fashion much more mature, thoughtful songs.  After a few listens, I got it - these guys aren't reinventing the wheel and they never will be.  But dear god, they do this classic heavy metal thing better than just about everybody who isn't actually IN Maiden or Sabbath.  The writing shows a lot more confidence and precision this time around and the result is an exceptionally cohesive record.  The vocals are up front and clear and the melodies continue where Warp Riders left off.  Some of these songs, especially the album closing title track, have vocal hooks as big as the riffs - it's so nice to see JD Cronise coming into his own as a singer.  The aforementioned title track features an awesome synth keyboard arrangement that clearly shows how far they've come since the first LP.  And if they're aping Black Sabbath, they're following in their footsteps in a very specific way, with little flourishes of extra melody and sweet shimmers here and there, throwing in lighter moments and textural shading once in a while.  In that way, this record reminds me a lot of Volume 4and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, where Sabbath started to experiment a tad and mature in the right ways.  And you know what?  If I'm comparing Apocryphon to Volume 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, it's a five star record, and one of the best of the year.  Case closed.<br /><br />Come to think of it, there is something that's a bit \\"out there\\" on this record, and it's the song \\"Hawks & Serpents.\\"  Its sound is appropriately heavy and down-tuned, but it sure reminds me of an awesome 80's metal song, right down to the guitar solo.  Not too many bands are tipping their hat in that direction without irony, but I definitely hear some - gasp - Scorpions or Dokken influences on that track.  But don't worry - overall you're still getting tons of Sabbath and Wino worship all over this gem of an LP.  The Black Sabbath comparison might be the single most overused one in all of music criticism (a go-to crutch for the clueless and a frequent lazy one for the metal-literate) but I think it truly is apt in this case, where in many cases it simply means \\"sludgy riffs.\\"  The song \\"Seven Sisters\\" could wholesale BE a lost Black Sabbath composition from Volume 4 or Master of Reality, and I can't remember the last time I've thought that about a song.  It is total mastery of the style (not a ripoff, big difference); the song just slays.  Another band that comes to mind in a few of the bluesier compositions is Clutch.  I know The Sword are really into Robot Hive/Exodus and Strange Cousins From The West, two great Clutch records produced by J. Robbins at the Magpie Cage in Baltimore.  And those two records are why The Sword made Apocryphon in Baltimore with J. Robbins.  His production is absolutely perfect for the band, just as it was for Clutch on those records.  He knows how to record these kind of rifforama groups.  Sonically speaking, this is by far the best sounding record The Sword has yet released.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy it.  Maybe you'll be lucky enough to snag an awesome cassette tape copy, like I did.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game.  Lots of fun.  Keeps you busy and interested.  Nice graphics.  Love the original and love this one just as much.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The author is able to capture all the important aspects of his life especially his philosophy of running business.  Life of Steve Jobs is an inspiring story in itself.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|love the movie.<br />packaging was good.<br /><br />I redeemed the digital copy which gives you a choice of VUDU, amazon video and a few others.  I chose amazon.  it only gave me a credit of $7.50 to purchase the movie  the amazon instant video was $10 (at the time).  leaving $2.50 difference
0891419063|5.0|I was required to read this as part of my WWII study class. Of all of the memoirs that I read in that class, this one is by far the best.

B008518MOW|5.0|Love film and the 3D looks great! Josh Brolin plays a great young agent K and though the story is typical MIB, there are some nice twists and turns. The combo pack with UV is very convenient and a good bang for the buck. I just wish there was a little more bonus content. All in all, solid!

B007L6VR6M|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom, in my opinion, is probably Wes' best film yet. It's a sweet coming of age story with an ensemble cast that gels to take you into the world of Sam and Suzy, the misunderstood main characters and their well meaning but dysfunctional family, friends and fellow townspeople. The cinematography is worth a viewing alone. Add witty and poignant dialogue and a wealth of career-high performances from Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray and Edward Norton as well as the leads who play &#34;Sam and Suzy&#34; and you have a funny and tender film that you'll enjoy time after time.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Great book all the way. I love anything to do with understanding the human psyche's unbelievable and complicated ability to process emotion within itself. We are all such complex people.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! Started watching this show when it first came on Showtime and got addicted to it. Now with box set I am addicted to it again. This is the first show that discovered the sexy Henry Cavill and second time seeing  Jonathan  Rhys Meyers.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I like Deepak's simplicity.  He gets his point across without going in to drawn out explanations.  I read this book quicker than I have ever read any other book.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|It is a good concept of the movie with the Gods and Titans. Henry Cavill is great as Theasus and makes the movie with him in little clothes showing off his well built body. The fight scenes are awesome.<br />The problem is the storyline with King Hyperion and 'releasing' the Titans, he doesn't do anything with the Titans and the accents some have British accents some have American.
B001DHXT6G|1.0|i have to say that I wound up opening only the 'Season One' volume of the set I received. In this volume, both sides of the disc are playable - regular DVD and DVD-HD, even though the latter is now obsolete. Unfortunately for me the very first disc of vol 1 had the regular version on top and there was a HUGE GASH - not 'scratch', 'GASH' - on it. I didn't even bother to remove it, or open the others. Paramount's quality control on this must have consisted of that gorilla we used to see in that ad tossing the American Tourister luggage around.<br />There are MANY other warnings about quality control within the other negative reviews included here, but I ignored them 'cause the price was temporarily lowered to just over $100.00, and figured I'd take a chance. OOOPS! I should have listened, and urge anyone reading this to read the more detailed negative reviews, which mirror not only my particular problem but too many others for anyone to even CONSIDER buying this - at any !@#$%^& price!

B009FREK3W|5.0|I grew up in the age of ELO (grad HS in 1978) and at the time, I just didn't connect.  However, last week I was listening to an Adam Carolla podcast with Jeff Lynne.  In-between the talking, they played a little bit of \\"Do-Ya\\", which I remembered, and also \\"Steppin' Out\\" which I don't remember at all. It was surprising to me, but for someone who did not really like ELO 30 years ago, I know most of the songs on this album.  Some people have mentioned that they liked previous masterings better.  I only had one original song in my library (Telephone Line) and I like the 2012 version better.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of my favorite albums to play now.

B0099114WO|3.0|While HOPE SPRINGS wants to congratulate itself for examining the stagnation of a 31 year marriage, it is actually a movie about a disillusioned couple avoiding sex.  90% of the film has Kaye and Arnold discussing why they don't have sex anymore or what they can do to bring sex back to their union.  Which is all well and good, but where does love fit into the equation.  Not once do they say \\"We don't make love anymore\\" or \\"Let's make love\\".  It's this ultimate tunnel vision which ultimately left me cold.  Is there love without sex?  Sex without love?  The script never clearly delineates exactly why Arnold is reluctant to show physical attention to the needy Kaye.<br />Even so, one can't help getting involved and that's due to the superb performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  Streep has rarely been so restrained.  No real showy histrionic scenes.  None of her usual OMG moments.  Yet she is marvelous as always.  Her command of who Kaye really is enables us to identify and feel for her.  Jones is equally effective as the husband who feels the longevity of their marriage supports his idea of a successful relationship.  Steve Carell's turn as the wise marriage therapist is a nice change of pace for the usually manic performer.  I liked Elisabeth Shue's brief but comfortable appearabce as a witty bartender.<br />HOPE SPRINGS is a \\"nice\\" movie, but not a great one.  Instead of watching two people fall in love all over again, we see two people have sex.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Dark and twisty with humanity, great movie.  I liked all the actors who were involved and it was nice to see some of them in new or different roles.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This book is supposed to be a collection of stories from the perspectives of the worlds inhabitants as the world falls to a zombie pandemic.  There isn't any more to it than that.  This is a book where the author seemed to just jot down whatever story fragments he could think about a world at war with zombies, and then threw them where he thought they belonged in the book.<br /><br />Despite all accounts belonging to different voices, they all speak with the same one.  The author in fact seems to think that writing in this fragmented mode excuses lack of care for characterization, or any over arching story.  After a point I really had to question why I was still reading, I still don't know what the endeavor can glean with this book.  I put it down and moved on to Warm Bodies, which was a much wanted reprieve, it at least having characters.

0060507772|5.0|In this book, Pratchett pulled together the best of the elements of his Discworld series (I only missed Granny Weatherwax, but all the rest of my favourites, including Death, were there) and joined them together in a beautiful tale of rebellion against old age and gods (who'd died and made them gods, anyway?!). Clever illustrations by Paul Kidby are an additonal bonus; a book worthy of Leonard of Quirm.

B000OCXI3K|5.0|The main characters in Chocolat are well drawn and are kept vital through evolving personal detail and a healthy dollop of &#34;bombshell&#34; revelations about hidden pasts and dark motivations. The small town setting could be anywhere... glaring hypocrisy and provicialism balanced out by a neighborly esprit, intimacy and frendliness that only seems to be found in such places. A subtle underlying battle between benign paganism and a controlling church plays out charmingly throughout the book. You will fall in love with some characters and revile others. You KNOW these people. You have met them. I highly recommend this title. It will lift your spirits and enrich your soul.

0439023513|5.0|Don't know why people dislike it so much but this has to be my favorite book out of the trilogy loved Peeta's storyline and especially the ending. However not gonna lie Suzanne did rush the ending and doesn't keep your attention like the hunger games did and catching fire and it did have a slow start and boring parts but it's still my favorite!<br /><br />************************SPOILERS******<br />Katniss basically becomes the Mockingjay for District 13 and Peeta is with the Capitol in the beginning but then they get him back- but he's \\"hijacked\\". This means they took all his memories and twisted them around and made it look like katniss is the enemy and Peeta wants to kill her- he almost succeeds one time. A lot of people die- Prim( Surprising and sad she dies from a bomb that was developed by Gale and Beetee), Finnick( I couldn't believe it), Cinna( I LOVED CINNA), Madge ( i thought she would end up with gale), Boggs, Mitchell, and a lot of other people. Darius ( the peacekeeper from district 12) and the red headed avox girl who kind of becomes \\"friends\\" with katniss get tortured to death. At the end, they vote on making it so that the hunger games be for the capitol children. President Snow is to get assassinated and the new President who was the President of district 13, president coins, arranges so that katniss can kill him. Katniss goes to the rose garden and sees Snow there and he tells her it was coins that bombed the children which included Prim- Katniss was near by and tried to save her and almost died herself. SHe knows that Snow wouldn't lie to her and she feels that he is telling the truth. When she goes to kill snow in public she shoots the arrow at coins instead. She goes to trial then gets released and sent to district 12 with haymitch. Her mom can't bear to go back and gets a job at a hospital in district 4. SNow dies in teh chaos. At the end, Gale gets a job in district 2 and katniss realizes she doesn't llove him. Peeta comes to live in the victors village with her and the slowly get back together. The epilogue takes place twenty years later, and katniss and peeta have two kids- a girl and a boy. There are no more hunger games but they are taught in school- her older daughter knows that they helped stop it. It ends after printing the song that she sang to Rue when she died. this book was so touching i actually cried. LOVE PEETA!rs village with her and the slowly get back together.

Pat wants to get back together with his wife, even though there is a restraining order keeping him from contacting her.

0439023483|5.0|this book is one of my favorites, this book will blow your mind I enjoyed reading Katniss and Peeta's story.<br /><br />Plot<br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen has been providing for her family since her father's death in a mining accident. She has done this by illegally hunting beyond the boundaries of District 12 and using the game she kills for food or for barter. Through her skill with a bow and her ability to track and snare rabbits and squirrels, her family has been able to survive.<br />They have also survived because Katniss signs up for the tessera, a ration of grain that is given in exchange for placing your name in the lottery for the reaping, the ceremony that determines who will be the district's representative in the Games. Everyone's name goes in the lottery from the time they reach the age of 12 until they turn 18. Each time Katniss exchanges her name for the tessera, her chances of being the one whose name is called increase. Only it isn't her name that is called. It is her sister's.<br /><br />Prim Everdeen is the one person that Katniss loves above all others. She is only 12, quiet, loving and on her way to being a healer. She would not be able to survive the reaping and Katniss knows this. When Prim's name is called, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place as a tribute from District 12 to the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Katniss knows that it is not only her own life on the line in the games, but that others will benefit as well if she is the victor and her skills as a hunter will give her an edge in the Games. But her life as a tribute becomes more complicated by the other tribute from District 12. Peeta Mellark, the baker's son, is a boy that Katniss thinks she owes a favor to because of a kindness that he showed her when she was most desperate and her family's survival was at stake. And Katniss knows that now her survival will mean his death.

B00A81MV3U|1.0|The critics were wrong, AGAIN!<br /><br />it was a boring movie for me Jennifer Lawrence was horrible and loved Bradley I should have waited to rent instead of wasting my money!<br /><br />I should have learned that critics reviews are usually very wrong about movies cause boy were they wrong about this one. Well lesson learned. After ravings and ravings about the amazing Silver Linings Playbook movie from critics and people I was excited to see this movie, I was gonna see it anyway because I loved the book, and come on this was an amazing cast, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert, this is a dream cast. Boy was I super duper disappointed! How in the world this movie got all these awards beats me, well I think because this was such an amazing cast everyone makes themselves or wants themselves to like this movie, cause that's the only reason I can think of. As badly as I wanted to believe the hype and make myself like it because the cast was amazing, I could not lie to myself. It was an utter disappointment. Of course I have a bunch of people telling me I'm wrong just because this movie has a dream cast everyone says it's amazing but they don't explain why it's amazing. Well why do I dislike it? Well the acting would be one of the many problems with this movie, Jennifer's acting in this movie was way over rated. Of course I get comments like \\"your just a hater\\" well let me tell you that I'm not because I loved her in the hunger games, she carried that film, so no I'm not a hater. Robert was also a disappointment, he just didn't bring his A game into this film. Another problem with this film is that it's one thing for this to be a book but it's another thing to make this into a movie, a comedy movie. I see nothing funny with making fun of illness. Another problem is that for me this movie had to do with more football and dancing then what the book was about and that was also a very huge disappointment, I'm going to get more comments from people who already have an opinion on this movie telling me that I'm wrong or I didn't explain something correctly so therefore I'm wrong about the whole thing or my opinion sucks or I'm boring just because I dislike this movie and blah, blah, blah! It's just annoying, it seems that people forget that this is just my opinion, MY POINT OF VIEW on this movie. I guess they have nothing better to do then to just go on all the 1 star reviews and tell us how wrong we are. But if I can at least stop one person from seeing this movie then I'd done my job. But hey I'm just as upset because this was such an amazing cast, wasted on a movie that turned out to be horrible. I almost walked out on this movie, but I stayed hoping it would get better as the book did but it just didn't. This movie had very few laughs. The movie was just very dull to me. The script was a mess. I also wasn't fine with the fact how they changed some scenes in the movie. Yes I understand it's a movie and they have to do that. I will never go into a movie with such hopes again, no matter how many critics and people say it's amazing, lesson learned! So I guess I shouldn't have such high hopes for the hunger games: catching fire.n opinion on this movie telling me that I'm wrong or I didn't explain something correctly so therefore I'm wrong about the whole thing or my opinion sucks or I'm boring just because I dislike this movie and blah, blah, blah!

B000MGUZM0|2.0|I don't get all the hoopla about AF if this album is representative. Maybe it's that every generation needs a Meatloaf to carry us away from our suburban frustrations?  Some okay licks, but most here is earnest, melodramatic, vapid, overproduced, and--at least to my ear--lacking the emotional authenticity of the similarly veined Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.

B009LRE040|3.0|Who knew the Cat/Bat romance was a May December one.  Don't tell Adam West!  And Robin appears when Bruce is old and gray.  OK.  I thought catwoman was just a walk on.  Anne is sexy as ever, but a little lightweight for the part.  Why even bother having her in the 3 hour movie if she only has 8 lines.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bane is a super intelligent Ninja when every time I have seen him in the DC universe he is an amped up brute.  I would have liked to see him juice up and transform into the hulk.  As he was, he was intimidating only because Batman never threw a batarang at his precious mask.<br /><br />Minor nit.  Bane sacrifices one of his own people on the airplane so the CIA won't get suspicious, but takes the doctor from the plane.<br /><br />What is this Harvey Dent hero thing? And Ras Al Ghul's daughter is a billionaire mogul whose only goal is to blow up Gotham? Becoming a billionaire is a lot of work. Oh well.  I thought Gordon was ready to retire in the last one.  8 years later and he hasn't aged a day, but Bruce is worn out and old...  Some great action sequences.  The stupid Tom Swift plane wouldn't have been able to outrun a rocket though with that rotor on the underside, it wouldn't fly either.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Prometheus is a large budget SiFi movie that shows its spending. The sets and effects are excellent and there is even a coherent plot that starts out about the origin of man and morphs into an 'Alien' prequel.  Now this is not a bad thing and asside from a several logic flaws, the movie has a good mix of character development and action sequences. And they do a very good job alighning with the original 'Alien' flick of years ago, at least as far as my memory goes. Overall, a good effort and a keeper if you are a collector of SiFi flicks.
0451169514|1.0|I was very eager to read this novel. I have read many books, works of fiction and non-fiction, however this was my first time reading a Stephen King novel. Being around the Halloween time period I was in the mood to be SCARED. Who better than Stephen King to get me in the spirit? With so many glowing reviews on so many of his books I thought that maybe this could be the start of something beautiful, a Stephen King reading spree. I chose IT as my introduction novel because perhaps more than any of his books this seemed to have the most praise.<br /><br />Very rarely will I give a book a 1 star review. I have a great appreciation for authors and can't imagine how intelligent one must be to craft a story and a world so dense and lifelike. That being said, this book was a farce. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have. Reasons as follows:<br /><br />- IT'S NOT SCARY. Not once during this book did I feel afraid of anything. Isn't that the supposed staple of Stephen King? No tense moments, no fear to read the next sentence, NOTHING!<br /><br />- Tired literary techniques. This book uses all the textbook tricks of cliffhangers. Hinting at something mysterious that makes no sense, coming back to mention it 200 pages later with ever so slightly more detail, and then another 200 pages later, etc. I understand this part of literature, and I don't always despise it....But when the majority of a novel is made up of this technique AND all of these \\"secrets\\" turn out to be something utterly disappointing...you feel cheated.<br /><br />- One dimensional characters. I am probably a little picky on my characters. I want them to be real people containing elements of good and bad, heroism and humility. Not here. Everyone in this book comes out of a can. You've got the class clown, the bully, the abusive father, the stuttering hero. It was very hard to relate to anyone as a REAL PERSON.<br /><br />- It's too long. I did read the whole novel. This review is not written based on me giving up after a couple hundred pages. That being said, once I finished it was clear to me that probably half the book could have been omitted. I also feel that certain portions of the story should have been enhanced to greater detail. Too much time and effort was spent on insignificant plot while other elements clearly deserved more detail and explaining.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />- The gang bang (or \\"running train\\") on an 11 year old girl. Let me say that I have no problem with gratuitous sex in literature. I really have a very low filter for everything I read. Never have I come across something and turned away because it was offensive or over the top. This however, was completely unnecessary to the story arc. I really have no idea why this was in the book at all. To garner attention or controversy? To hopefully sell more copies? When I made it to this passage I was actually laughing out loud because I had realized how absurd the novel had become at this point.<br /><br />I am truly confused on how this book has so many fantastic reviews. Maybe it's the same reason that the top ranked shows on television are \\"American Idol\\" and \\"Honey Boo Boo\\". Do people just fall in love with trash?<br /><br />My advice - If you are a true fan of literature and story building. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I won't be dipping my toe in anything Stephen King ever again.giving up after a couple hundred pages.

1426308469|5.0|A birthday gift for a 4 year old. I've already given him dinosaur figures but I don't know if he has been able to match those with what he sees in the book. I liked the looks of the book. Seemed suitable for a 4 year old.
0756697875|5.0|awesome! Great pictures and stories behind the Lego Batman characters. Highly recommended! Mini Electric Suit Batman is a great plus.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|Brilliant DVD.  I saw it on BBC's Imagine.  All about how the Bridge Over Troubled Water film showed how Simon and Garfunkel's relationship was splitting.  Also lots of political and moral history which affected at the time.  If you lived in the 70's you will find it interesting.  Plus of course the albumn.  Really good price too..<br /> You can't get it over here and it's good that Amazon.com have it. You can pay in sterling even though it's priced in dollars.  Very pleased with the purchase.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in three days.  It was such a great book.  The suspense, the mystery keeps you wanting more.  I highly recommend it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Movie's great. Slow start that makes it seem like the movie will be bad, but it's not. Hang in there and ignore the negative reviews. (It seems like Disney forgot to pay those boys off this time) Poor marketing is what did this movie in. People didn't know what it was, saw Disney attached to an action movie and thought \\"No sex, no violence, no me.\\" The movie's got good ol' fashioned clean action in it! A true adventure story, Disney did not let me down! Give it a shot, this movie is well worth your time and money!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the very best calculator.  It has several very nice functions and is easy to use. I love it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this app is so cool but I don't how you need wifi to use it<br />but otherwise it is really cool all my elementary friends about it and everything now I'm finally one of them Tots cool!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was such a CUTE movie. My husband & I took our grandkids to see it at the theater & they loved it (so died WE!) so much that I bought the DVD for them for Christmas.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|A bit of a letdown.  ABSOLUTELY loved the first season.  Bummed we can't see full episodes for free through the network.  This first episode was all over the place.  I suppose it was meant to be teasers of a full story...but it really wasn't that interesting.  The actual filming did a lot of the flash scenes that actually detracted from the film, in my opinion.  I may purchase episode 2 in hopes of getting hooked ...again.  But if not significantly improved, I'm moving on.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I love all of the Shrek movies as much as all my grandkids did, so I just had to buy them the DVDs so they could enjoy them over & over again!
0547884591|5.0|It isn't enough to say that Tim Ferris is brilliant. He is becoming a legendary figure in the movement of challenging the status quo, and opening peoples eyes to the idea that it is in fact possible to learn new things without adhering to the outdated traditional methods that so often become barriers of entry. If you're looking for true inspiration on how to achieve more, this is an outstanding place to start.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|lots of mindless fun. annoying that you actually have to use real money tho to get money in the game.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed this app. However, the only thing that was slow was the direct messaging. It should get to you right away, but instead I recieved the message the next day. Other than this small detail, this was a very enjoyable app. I highly recommend it.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My little cousin loves everything Avengers.  Not only does he have to build it, but this lego set really lets his imagination go.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|single player mode is hard to adjust to your preferred playing level.  I have not tried two player because I travel often
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Proveedor muy responsable en la entrega del producto, todo fue en el tiempo dicho no presento ningun retraso y por eso los recomiendo son muy responsables
B002UNMW7O|5.0|It's always hard to watch a sequal when the first is one of my favorites, but this is a wonderfully done True part 2 and it comes close to being as good as the first
B000B5KQY4|3.0|I gave this CD 3 stars because the song I wanted to hear was nice and long.  Moments of love relaxex me before going to bed at night.
B009VB97EY|5.0|One of the best Channing tatum movies ever!! Definitely recommend this movie!!! It's exciting and I know all the ladies will love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great end to a great series!<br />If u have read the other books u won't b disappointed. Suspenseful and diverting.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Game was fun and kept you on your toes. Really had to make tough decisions as to what you should do next which is entertaining and educational. Game<br /> speeds up the longer you play.Have no idea what the points you earn are for since all I want to buy asks for REAL money,which ruins everything. Should be able to do more on your own winnings,I refuse to spend money just to play a game.VERY disappointing,you lost me as a player due to your greed. What a downer for kids playing along. One more app to delete.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn offers a great novel.  Great plot, feel it is the best of all.<br />Looking for next novel
B007Q0OV6Q|1.0|Gave this to my 8 year old and am sitting here looking at what he's opened after day 7 and I can tell you it looks like a few  pieces that have  been lost from other sets.  I blasted my wife for spending that much money on this empty box!!!!  Lego should be ashamed of themselves!  Rip Off.  we have quite a few lego sets around here - including the millenium falcon with 1254 pc.  this one has a mere 254 and they are tiny - many are single post pieces.  blah, have to quite thinking about it!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I love it. Great packaging and easy to navigate DVD's. The writing and acting in this series is fantastic. Even though I am coservative in my views, I would vote for Jed Bartlett and Matt Santos.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Great movie at an Excellent price. It is a movie that everyone can enjoy because it has it all, action, comedy etc
055338466X|4.0|Builds a lot on his other books but in the early chapters repeats a lot of already covered material from the others as well. Another great book for anyone curious about string theory and the multi-verse. Written in easy to understand terms and illustrations are simple enought to get with out being boring. Definitly recommend to anyone wanting to know more about the universe as we know it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have always enjoyed puzzles but since downsizing there's no room so this is the perfect solution and the selections in the free category are good.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I bought this to replace an old large tower I was using as a media box. I switched over the memory and drives and bought a cheep Intel socket 1155 processor and It works great. It is small quiet and does everything I need it to. Didn't move the old video card over to it because of the power issues. Everything that is on board is good enough. It will have it's limits for gaming, but that's not what I got it for.<br />!!!Fantastic Product!!!
1416972242|5.0|You can't go wrong in the series.  This book was great and left you hanging and wanting more just like the book before it.  Worth the buy.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|The restoration effort of CBS on [[ASIN:B0083TUEHY Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season One [Blu-ray]]]was an exceptional job. By comparison season two which was farmed to an outside company so that CBS could get ALL seven seasons out by the end of 2014 demonstrates how exceptional and difficult the job was to rescan the original elements and recomposite the visual effects. While this isn't a horrible job(the word sloppy comes to mind), there are issues with the second season that fans should be aware of related to the quaity of the image and the recomposite visual effects.<br /><br />So--four stars for the season, three stars for the restoration work and five stars for the extras. Three and a half stars when measuring all of these elements.<br /><br />First let's start with the good stuff; the second season STILL blows away the standard DVDs released nearly a decade ago and the best restoration work here does compare to the first season. The problem is that this set is inconsistent.<br /><br />The 7.1 audio remix and the original soundtrack are both terrific sounding. There's considerable presence.<br />We get alternate audio in German, Spanish, Italian, French and Japanese. Subtitles are provided in English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish<br /><br />The special features are outstanding. We get the following featurettes and documentaries which will be of interest to fans-- \\"Mission Overview: Year Two\\", \\"Departmental Briefing: Year Two - Memorable Missions, Departmental Briefing: Year Two - Production\\", \\"Selected Crew Analysis: Year Two and Inside Starfleet Archives: Penny Juday - Star Trek Coordinator\\". \\"Reunification\\" gives us a reunion of the cast that lasts a little bit over an hour. \\"Making It So\\" runs over 80 minutes and looks back over the series.<br /><br />We also get two commentary tracks (something sorely lacking for fans of the series) on \\"Measure of a Man\\" by the writer of that episode Melinda Snodgrass. We also two an HD extended version of \\"Measure\\" (reconstructed following a VHS copy of the first cut of the episode provided by writer Snodgrass)as well as a hyrid that weaves in alternate takes, angles and features the original onset sound. We also get a commentary on the \\"Q Who?\\" the episode that introduced us to the Borg by VFX supervisor Dan Curry, director Rob Bowman, Michael & Denise Okuda.<br /><br />We also get other featurettes including on the tech, \\"Strange New Worlds\\", \\"New Life and Civiliations\\" (which I haven't dug into yet), an episode of \\"Reading Rainbow\\" (Levar Burton hosted this show during the original run of the series).<br /><br />Now for the not-so-good stuff in this set.<br /><br />There is over use of digital noise reduction on a number of episodes including \\"Measure of a Man\\". This was done to reduce the level of grain but it also washes out fine detail. It still looks superior to the original DVDs.<br /><br />The producers also experimented with using different film stocks during the second season to try and find the right fit for the show. As a result, grain varies quite a bit (sometimes from shot-to-shot)although the production company that did the transfer, restoration and scans SHOULD have used a tool called grain management to make the grain a bit more consistent.<br /><br />The grain is a bit distracting (almost appearing to be like video noise but I suspect that it is an example of inadequate grain management and the different film stocks used more than a flaw in the transfer itself).<br /><br />The visual effects composites are a bit sloppy as well. In one shot, for example of the episode \\"Pen Pals\\", the edge of the saucer section disappears as it speeds away from the planet. There are other issues that occur as well some of which you may or may not notice. Planets have less detail than the first season set indicating some of the digital effects aren't quite as strong here (planets were digitally recreated and replaced).<br /><br />The second episode of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" is flawed but is still superior to the DVDs. Luckily, CBS will be doing season three (although they will be alternating odd with even seasons. The good news is that the post-production house that made the mistakes on this one will not be involved in seasons 4 and 6).<br /><br />I'd still recommend this set even with its flaws and I doubt that, due to the cost of the restoration, that any sort of correction will be done for this set.r />The second episode of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" is flawed but is still superior to the DVDs.

0764169742|5.0|beautiful illustrations throughout this book.  This artists command of colored pencils is wonderful and the illustrations are presented with easy to understand instructions
B008J34466|3.0|So, what does a 67 year old grandpa think of Pink?  I became interested in the CD after hearing Blow Me One Last Kiss.  A break-up song just can't be any catchier or more honest.  And Pink has a great voice.  She walks that fine line between pop, and banal; and unfortunately falls into the latter a few times too often to earn any higher rating from me.  There are some terrific songs on the album, but also some that sound like she is trying a bit too hard to write hits.  The language some have mentioned doesn't bother me a whit, but the imitative striving does.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is for my granddaughter.  She's in love with the music from this and wanted it so she can practice with
B000YHG72E|5.0|Very touching, while being absolutely hilarious.  One of my family's all-time favorite Christmas movies.  Will Ferrell is a genius at playing an innocent.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book wasn't as good as the others in this series.  It seemed to drag and I skimmed through a lot of the dialog.  It was harder for me to pick up on who some of the characters were and I ended up going back and forth a lot.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Looks great on my Kindle Fire.  Small graphics, but the clarity makes it easy  to play.  Many different layouts keeps the game interesting.  And, it's free!I
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the best book I've read in years.  The tale is believable.  Characters are well thought out and the organization of the story is original.  Don't start this book if you have anything else to do today and tonight.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a very good movie. Dare I say that this movies is the best of all superhero movies! It combines an actual plot with a stellar cast that actually has good chemistry and leadership from the one and only Joss Whedon. All in all the man is a genius.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Even at free it's not worth it.  I refuse to give out info just to play a game. I don't. want to sign on thru. facebook in order to play a game.  Uninstalled rather quickly!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is a great set for the avid Firefly/Serenity fan. People always say that Firefly/Serenity should be brought back and I agree with this sentiment but maybe it isn't the best idea. The movie was a very good and worthy conclusion and will always be in the hearts and minds of the fans. The shortlived but phenomenal series about the raggedy band of misfits on the edge of space will always live on as the story that was bright and shiny and died before it could wither away like many of the other stories on television. Long live Serenity! Because we all aim to misbehave!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this show.  It's suspenseful and entertaining.  We have watched it since the beginning and always look forward to the next episode.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I bought these brackets to go with the Maglite flashlight I purchased. Every time it stormed and the power went out, we spent so much time looking for a flashlight that the power was usually back on by the time we found it. I mounted these on the wall in the laundry room. Use anchors for sure because these babies have a tight grip.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|Although I'm a former marathon runner, I found the intense detail of the running boring. I did like the explanations of the author's vegan eating choices, and I even tried (successfully!) some of the recipes. But overall, boring. I found I could skip long tracts and it didn't matter.
B00190OHD6|5.0|I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter.  We have always loved it! Great story about moving on after a tragedy.....
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Between the 4HWW, 4HB and now 4HC, Tim Ferriss has covered damn near every aspect of life, learning and happiness.<br /><br />Unbelievable level of detail including the WHY and HOW and includes insight into dozens of different fields/hobbies.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in cooking, self-education and living the good life.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is the kind of book that you immediately get into and read at a fast pace since it is so good. The movie looked funny, but since I read the book beforehand, it was a great disappointment on the screen. No fault to the actors, they were great, but the scriptwriters changed too many things that were already perfectly laid out in the book. I'm glad I read this book and have recommended it to friends.
0061692042|3.0|I know this writer is highly praised and from reading &#34;Canada&#34; I can see why. However, this book did not hold my interest. It goes on too long without much happening. Furthermore, I could not warm up to any of the characters. I could not recommend this book because the writer takes too long to tell the story. I expected more action and less descriptive prose.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|I got this as the free app of the day today from Amazon.<br /><br />I think this is a Yahtzee type game, but I can't play it unless you sign into Facebook or create an account which I would rather not do.<br /><br />There was a Local Play mode where you can play with someone in the same room as you, but unfortunately the app gives me an application stopped unexpectedly message every time and closes.<br /><br />Therefore, I have to give this app a 1 star rating until this bug is fixed since you can only play this one by logging into online accounts for now which I would rather not want to do.
031620157X|5.0|My son absolutely loves this book!! He talks about it all the time with such excitement in his voice :)
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I install it on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S II) and on my tablet Asus TF101<br />Very easy to use and i can track my orders from amazon with a few touches
0316010669|5.0|Grabs your attention from the first paragraph.  Provides real world examples to support his observations in a way that helps you understand it on a deeper level...<br /><br />Just get the book....
1595828753|5.0|The story continues.  It's good to see more of Toph and Sokka in this book.  Their antics are hilarious!  Good ol' Team Avatar is back!
B009K0P10K|4.0|I love the mind bending, back stabbing antics that these people do.  Great entertainment if you like trying to figure out what will happen next!!
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Great album! Another good one From Detroit! If fan of Kid Rock definite album to pick up. Homerun again. God Bless America!
0316187216|4.0|The Good - the story works, it flows well, and the sparse writing style continues to hit home hard.  It is also a great setting with the a lot of secondary characters that really fill things in.  I could see the Sergio Leone backdrop - dusty, dry and hot  - while I was reading it.  And I read it in less than a week. The sense of the older world in the background continues to be interesting.<br /><br />The Bad - I was unsatisfied with the character of Logen - who popped and sizzled in the First Law series.  In a lot of ways he and Glotka carried the whole story.  That character had more depth than this one who felt like he was shoe horned into a role for the sake of the western style of this piece.<br /><br />The Ugly - This felt like it would have been a brilliant novella.  But I think the story wasn't big enough to fill all those words.  And I think it showed a bit after a while.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is just the best author their is. I have read all his books and not one I didn't like. Yet I'm saddened by finishing the book because it was so thrilling and suspenseful.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Ever since in debut Friends has been a hit with families across the nation. This is still a classic for the generation that grew up with it and now for the younger generation as well. The Bluray discs are great and the case is  very well organized. Much better than the previous DVD rendering of the full series because the way the discs are packaged along with the qualities of bluray prevent the previous problem of scratched discs.
0812984412|3.0|I bought this book for my husband for his birthday.  He tells me it's very difficult to follow, and is easily one of the hardest books he's ever read.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|The movie is great and a horror classics and the Blu-ray restoration makes for a great addition to any collection.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a fabulous and well written story.  I could not put it down!!
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|Each day you get a little part of something, but its hard to tell what you are getting.  My son spent a lot of time looking up the parts on the lego site and said some are hard to tell what part it is.  I think if I am going to spend this much money I would want the items in each day to either connect to the next day or to be complete for that day.  It would have been better to have mini figures or tiny complete vehicles like they sell in the packs in the store.  I got the mega block smurf one for my daughter who is much younger... and at least those are 1 complete item in each day... like the pieces to make a small tree... or a smurf... Either that or they are part of something that is obvious like a wall of a building.  It comes with a picture so she knows what its for and hints that another portion is soon to come.  For lego..this is kind of a rip off especially for my son who is a lego fanatic.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|Just what may husband wanted.  He was happy.  It was just what he wanted me to buy.  Funny funny funny
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I made my son read the first one before I would let him see the movie.  It made for great incentive for him... and he ended up reading two of the books quickly.  He's onto the third, but has some other novel to read for school.  I ended up taking him on a mom and son movie night to see the movie and we had a bunch of fun pointing out what is different from the book.  He did say the love story was kind of girly, but it had enough action and suspense to keep a 12yr old boy interested ;)
0385341008|5.0|I had no idea that the Channel Islands were left undefended in WWII. People shipped their children off to England during the war and had to cope with a German invasion. This is a story of coping and humor during a very difficult time.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|This is a fabulous book written in classic Hardy style.  It's full of twists, turns, and surprises.  Just when you think you know where Hardy is leading you, he throws in another detail, which leaves you dumbfounded and believing that no other than Thomas Hardy could pull this off.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have had wired headphones for a long time and dealt with many problems such as feedback and outside noise filtering through my mic so I decided to give these a try.  Great set of headphones.  Super comfortable and easy to use.  The quick programmable keys on the side are easy to program and make things happen very quickly.  The mic picks up my voice very clearly and cancels a lot of the outside ambient noise.  They also come with voice morphing software which makes your voice sound like 5 different creatures which provides plenty of entertainment during gameplay.  The wireless distance is great I can usually hit 60' between walls and floors and can still talk and listen to what is going on in the game.  The battery life is great and its very easy to charge between uses.  It also allows for gameplay wired in case you have one of those long nights of gameplay and just run the batteries down.  Great product and a fair price.
B007HACDLK|4.0|A little violent in spots, but does get right to the point. We must as a nation stop acting like a punching bag
B0000AQS0F|4.0|While far from being the best, it's still a nice series, that keeps you busy in the rainy days, when you got nothing else to watch!<br />The sceneries are few, mainly of the space ship, and few remote planet locations, the plot is generally simple, not too much SciFi bull, but more built around the relationship between the actors on stage (the captain, a fugitive doctor and his sister, a priest, a prostitute, mercenary and mechanic, traveling all on the same ship, sticking their heads out for one another).<br /><br />The character that I found most intriguing, would be the escorte/prostitute.<br />Not because of her mothering, but because of her etiquette response to almost everything, slow to judge, quick to try to please!<br /><br />The character I found most repelling is the weird girl. She plays bad roles in most of her movies. I just don't like her on stage, and seeing her naked was like not something I'd love to see again (though was more preferable than seeing the male captain naked).<br /><br />There are very few sex scenes, and no private parts are really shown.<br /><br />This is a cancelled series, incomplete; and though I'd not call this a budget series, it definitely not call it a bank breaker!<br />They managed to get everything quite simple on stage and in the movies. Even the CGI was very basic.<br />Nevertheless, still enjoyable!
0691126658|5.0|Great for the birding enthusiast.  Our guides loved it , too.  Somewhat bulky to carry, but full of important details.
B00000257O|4.0|Jaco Pastorius and Herbie Hancock where 2 masters you should have listened to when your granma told you!<br />Now their tracks are here waiting to be heard, and for you to become just as great as them, by listening to their creative funk/jazz compositions!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Nice toy, very detailed. Let's see how everyone enjoys this idea. we will use it for landscaping work at the service.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Have only read about 1/4 of the book and it is holding my attention so far.<br />Cant wait to finish it.
B00786XVOG|5.0|as always, Yanni does it again!! He is such a wonderful person and muscian, I highly recommend this video to all as well as his others.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am not sure about this app.  I have downloaded it but I have not used it.  It appears to be easy to use and has a lot of capabilities.  Not sure it is the right thing for me.  But I have recommended it to others who like it a lot.  Thanks Amazon, You Rock.
B005721W9O|1.0|I am very disappointed that this was presented as a purchase, but in fact it was a rental, thanks for making this one disgusting piece of deception!
B009B2VBWE|4.0|If you let let all the nose-in-the-air negative reviews stop you you'll miss a good album. Yes, it's different but if you close your eyes the the weirdly kinky cover art and listen without pose I think you'll like it, I know I have.<br /><br />Just say no to poseurs pretending to instruct an accomplished artist how to make music.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Good story but so full of terminlogy vocabulary a bit disconcerting....<br />  Know the Boston scene ...  And like the suspence....
0671646788|3.0|Don't have a clue about this book. i bought it for another person, there fore i dson't have an opinion.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Awesome show. Everything came in packages, CDs work perfectly. But without the high Price tag from best buy. Can't complain about that.
B003UGLCIA|2.0|In the not so distant past Linda Blair indicated that a certain addition of The Exorcist also had a special feature regarding how they did some of the scenes.  I mistakenly thought this was that addition.  It is not.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Awesome show. CDs are clean, no scratches. Everything came like it was from target, but without the high price tag
1400069289|1.0|The entire concept for this book is nothing more than a rehashing of psychological theory from the 1950's. If you ever took psychology 101 do not waste your  money on this book- remember B F Skinner or Pavlov? then you already know this amazing New? science!
B00138KEZ4|5.0|The product was exactly as advertised. We will buy again next time we need it. Thanks for the quick shipment.
B0011Z933S|5.0|Was really happy to see this offered as a free download. Death cab is a great band to chill out and listen too
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Fantastic book and what's more important - it really works!!! I think anyone who is interested to be stronger should read it.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Works great on my google nexus 7. Display is clear and fresh. fun classic arcade game to pass the time with
B000002J03|4.0|expected for the price that i paid which was more than fair. Glad its part of my collection now :) thanks!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|A basic stragey & luck game to try and win some coins. Like the real life game you play at thearcade
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Had to return the 2nd set, sadly for a refund this time. The pressing quality is so poor on this box set they really should pull them off the market and do them right. So disappointed in EMI and the manufacturing of this product! I will make a point of reading reviews on pressing quality next time I want to buy some new vinyl. There is a lot of good stuff out there, but a lot of crappy stuff too. I have had to return more than a fair share of 180gram vinyl.  C'mon guy's - we're willing to buy it, give us something worth keeping.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|I played piano as a young girl and bands like this make me want to take it up again. I love Chris Martin's piano melodies which are great without the help of the rest of the band.
B00881PPTO|3.0|Kayak used to be my 1st option for price checkng but don't think is still that good. Pro version only gets rid of ads which t be honest never bothered me.
B001230JXC|5.0|Huge fan of depeche mode. Make sure to download the WHOLE album. You will not be disappointed. Really nice that this is digital as well.
0399230033|5.0|Excellent book for infants, young children and preschoolers. I recommend it to parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles as an excellent book for talking about bed time.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Played this game for hours in the room while my sister was in labor. I couldn't get enough. Makes you think and you also need to be quick!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another great book by Ken Follett. If you like history, you will love this book! Lots of rich history. Lots of detail about World War l.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book nicholas sparks did it again!!! This book will make you laugh and cry all at the same time!!! One of my favs!!!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|The words are straight up, descriptive of what he sees.  His voice is reminiscent of Bob Dylan or James Taylor, or wmoewhere in between.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This really is a fantastic camera mount! It's extremely versatile and it gives me a little more piece of mind in the safety of my camera because it's almost like a &#34;cage&#34;. Comfortable to use and you can really get some great shots with it!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is good reading, with insights into the character of people who are not like me.  It is very entertatining.<br />Priceless literature it is not.
075669812X|5.0|Even though he can't read, my 5 yr old will spend an hour going through this book. The photos of the characters are full-color on thick glossy paper, and he loves to look at them all. And of course, he loves the figure that is included.  We like it so much, that I've ordered more for my nephew and a 6 yr old neighbor.<br /><br />It is really a beautiful book!
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's durable and SOOOO much better than my last controller that was worn out and the joystick was messed up, causing me to die in games left and right.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|What is Halloween with Hocus Pocus?  The perfect family movie - not gory or gross - just fun!  It is on our favorites list and we watch it every year.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I just got this on my daughter's kindle fire that I am giving her for Christmas, but I had to play it to see...it was very fun and I know she will love it!
B0081SRJSY|3.0|This is a good price for this game. I just feel that it relies too much on luck. I probably wont be playing it a whole lot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|liked this game quite a lot. quick to learn and becomes remotely challenging as you progress.. id recommend to anyone looking for a time killer
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony so I was so exited to see this app in the app store. its great fun for all ages!
B004FK24ZA|5.0|In glorious black and white it takes you back to Christmas past. The subtitles were easy to delete so were no problem. A true classic with Cary Grant terrific as always. The world has changed since the 40's. Can recommend this DVD for holiday viewing and will be enjoyed for years to come.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|This is a fun movie.  How I wish I had a stick like she has to make children behave. It is nice to watch a movie and not have to endure foul language.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Great acting and interplay. Interesting and edgy story line. Salma Hayek was wasted, she's too cute to be an evil drug boss. The v/o narrative, didn't help the story, particularly by the protagonist who was the cause of much of the strife, which she never acknowledges.  The plot started strong but dissolved at the end, although the alternative ending created some intrigue. Good entertainment. Good acting, visuals. I like that Olivier Stone is staying with his themes of war and the effects it has on civilian life.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|i found this game to be very frustrating, hard to get started  takes to many steps to get to the actual game
034580404X|4.0|read the first one was very into it.<br />still reading the second one as i'm not as interested. have to finish it to get to the third...hopefully i will do this before the movie comes out.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|great game even my 2 year old grandson plays it, he also likes angrey birds space and star wars the tips are helpful
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If you are buying this to add to your cook-book collection, then perhaps this is not your book. But if your are fascinated by learning and continuously mastering new skills in your life, from cooking to languages, cutting, hunting and making a fire, then you will enjoy this extremely well-researched piece.<br />You will not learn how to make an 8 layer wedding cake in 4 hours, but how to put simple ingredients together and make a delicious meal, fully slow carb compliant. Tim's discoveries in the kitchen are similar in enthusiasm to a 4 year old learning that throwing rocks in a pond will make tiny circular waves.<br />Loved it and highly recommend it!
B009VB97EY|3.0|I had higher expectations and the movies plot wasn't all that good. There wasn't much to the plot at all.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game and have a hard time putting it down once I start. I recommend it to anyone
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The movie is pretty good and it even has a go green message behind it. I thought it was pretty cute.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I never write reviews, but I just had to share how much I love this album. This album is quickly becoming my all-time favorite. I don't even remember the last album I bought that I could listen to all the way through on repeat for hours without getting tired of it. Every single song is a gem, even the interludes. It's hard to pick a favorite, but if you're looking for tracks to sample I would go with \\"Breezeblocks\\" or \\"Fitzpleasure\\" to get a taste. \\"Fitzpleasure\\" was the first single from Alt-J that I heard and I was immediately hooked.<br /><br />In short, just buy the album. Trust me.
B0087HT36U|5.0|My son loves this game more then Angry Birds.  His only complaint is that the cowboy stage isn't on here for the Kindle but on the I-phone
B007SSDS24|2.0|This is allright, I watched it under prime so it was free and it was worth exactly what I paid for it and not a dime more
0553584537|4.0|I've always liked Lisa Gardner. She always keep me guessing till the end. The suspense is always there which makes me read faster...
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|This CD is one of the few that I can listen to from beginning to end on repeat.  &#34;No Light, No Light,&#34; in particular, is a gem.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|It was an okay movie. I love Johnny Depp but this movie was just not that good for me, but good enough to pass the time.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This CD warrants repeated listening.  If you could only get one track off of this album though, check out &#34;Cosmic Love.&#34;
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family.  I enjoyed it just as much as the kids did the minions are what make this movie can't wait to see  part 2
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|This is the sort of CD that could break your heart.  The interludes don't bear repeated listening, but everything else does.  &#34;Lost,&#34; in particular, is a noteworthy track.  Frank Ocean tackles such issues as drugs and prostitution, so tender ears beware.  That said, if you normally don't spring for obscenities in your music, give Frank a chance anyway.  If you can get past some of his language, you won't regret it.  And this isn't to say that all of his songs are laced with obscene references to female anatomy.  Check out &#34;Thinkin' Bout You&#34; for proof of that.  And, to clarify, when he does delve into the traditional territory of female anatomy, he sings and raps about it in such a way that it's much more meaningful than, say, Lil Wayne or Big Sean.  Not that there's anything wrong with them.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|very funny movie you would never think of these 2 in the same movie but i can say they made the movie worth watching
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore steers clear of the excessive materialism and misogyny so prevalent in rap and hip hop these days.  In so doing, he gives us fresh rap with plenty of good messages.  He warns against materialism.  He warns against bigotry.  He laments addictions, both chemical and physical.  As such, he comes off as a little preachy.  I'm not complaining, though.  Anyone who consciously listens to popular rap and hip hop knows that we are in need of this.  When every other rap song seems little more than an homage to Gucci and Louis Vuitton, a fresh entry like &#34;The Heist&#34; is just what we need.<br /><br />This isn't to say that every one of his songs is packed with meaningful morals.  The album doesn't get stale.  Give it a try.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|It came on time - great service. It is a gift, so I am unsure if it works properly though yet. I have no doubts that it will though. You have always provided excellent quality merchandise to me previously. Thank you for all you do.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Each book gets better. Amazing story telling than keeps your eyes glued to the turning pages. Collins hit a home run.

B004YW4L5K|5.0|My second Neil Gaiman book, Coraline squeeked in just before. An amazing book! Many of my coworkers read it at the same time, and some are still reading it as they get the chance. It is a great book for a book club with plenty to talk about and speculation to be made. We all had a lot of fun reading this book and continue to encourage others to read it as well.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It seems a perfectly good portable tool for putting or maintaining a good edge on a blade. Better results can be obtained with more time and better home sharpening tools but the Pocket Pal does a good job &#34;on the fly'&#34;
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept my interest, even kept me reading past bedtime a number of nights.  Although I kept guessing how it would end, I never got it whole.  Interesting characters, likable in spite of their glaring faults.  I enjoyed it enough to try another by Gillian Flynn.  As a former English major and inveterate reader, I rate this book almost on a par with some of my favorites by Anne Rivers Siddons and Ann Tyler.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My girls and I love MLP and this app!!! we enjoy collecting all of the ponies and watching them socialize. The quests are fun. My only complaint is that I wish you didn't have to use social networking to gain hearts. We don't do this and therefore have reached an impasse in the game. :( still having fun collecting though.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Pros: 3D, cast is great, physical media is great, Scarlett Johansson<br /><br />Cons: Not enough Scarlett Johansson<br /><br />Recommendation: men, women, children, senior citizens
0545403359|5.0|Our book club read this book and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a book adults can cozy up to as well as teens.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a really relaxing game easy to play needs hardly any effort or concentration lots of difficulty levels or tips any a g e c an play
B0063IH60K|5.0|if u lookin for a good solitaty app. this is great! on my kindle fire. dont belive me just try it. its free :)
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This books really opens your mind up to a wide variety of habit research which can be applied to personal or corporate environments.<br /><br />With so much information, it could have been two books focusing on person and communal habits separately to keep the information focused on one realm of life at a time.  Thankfully, packing it all into one book give you more informational bang for your buck.<br /><br />Well worth the read and so much applicable information!

B008VO3PA4|5.0|The silent war between cats and humans has been going on for thousands of years. The key reason it continues is because we don't know enough to surrender. In part this is due to cats' cleverness. They have kept the battles at such a low level, we don't know the war is going on. It rages silently, below our radar.<br /><br />The author of &#34;I Could Pee on This&#34; is breaking the news to those who have been ignorant in their bliss. The cats have won. They are in charge. You don't believe it? Well, who's the one cleaning the litter box?<br /><br />Francesco Marciuliano knows cats. From feline typewriter fixation to toilet paper destruction to shattered wineglasses, the man has suffered––as have we all––at the paws of cats. And for the love of the diabolical little suckers, he––as do all we cat captives––keeps coming back for more.<br /><br />See &#34;This Is My Chair&#34; for your Cat's attitude towards property rights, &#34;Busy, Busy&#34; for cat sleeping habits. &#34;I Run&#34; reveals a cat's intense desire to appear to know what he's doing. &#34;Tripped&#34; and &#34;Talk to Me&#34; reveal your cat's devious nature and possible criminal intent. In &#34;Kneal (sic) before Me&#34; the true nature of Cat/human relations is revealed. &#34;Nudge&#34; has been my own personal experience with five cats over 60 years, so that one is absolutely dead-on right. Blush at &#34;Man's Best Friend&#34; because it's probably true. &#34;Family&#34; is very likely true––you aren't that important. Every cat is the center of his own universe. You are just a satellite. &#34;I Lick Your Nose&#34; is so true that I've bought thicker makeup to cover scratch scars from the cat who repositions me to suit his favored sleeping spots during the night. This is done by digging into my cheek or eye socket and pulling. When accomplished during REM sleep, I don't discover Rowdy's act of violence until I wash my face in the morning. And, of course, the title piece says it all: Your cat will dominate you at every turn.<br /><br />I laughed all the way through &#34;I Could Pee on This,&#34; often reading pertinent verses to my husband as we lay in the dark, me reading my Kindle, he drifting off to sleep. He didn't always react as I would have hoped. I'm hoping it was because he was half-asleep.<br /><br />I've converted him to being a cat person. But does the dog person in him still prevail? Rowdy, Jeep, Liam,  Smokey and I must get together and work on him. If forty-two years of cat domination haven't quite converted him yet, we'll have to take more drastic action....<br /><br />KLl: Your cat will dominate you at every turn.<br /><br />I laughed all the way through &#34;I Could Pee on This,&#34; often reading pertinent verses to my husband as we lay in the dark, me reading my Kindle, he drifting off to sleep.

B004SBQGHS|2.0|Didn't like it as it is too slow and hard to play.  Love the graphics though.  Still trying to get the hang of it.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love the game and all but all the sudden I just stooped getting people in my restaurant like what the heck how do I get them to come back in! what do I do
B0091W4IRY|5.0|Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.  The movie is a fun ride.  Well acted and good story.<br />Robert Downey Jr.  has turned into one of my favorites.<br />He has placed himself well in the movies and not become<br />type cast.  Good stuff here.
B001NLKXK2|3.0|It was well written, kept my attention, although the plot was average. My disappointment was that it did not end. When it<br />got to where I really wanted to know the book ended.
B009LREA1S|4.0|I think it was a fitting end for a great trilogy. The dark night was my favorite batman.  Christian bale did a fantastic job
1423136802|5.0|I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He loves to read and I believe he will enjoy reading these books. They were very nice, but I didn't unwrap them.  Great price.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Singing, sets and filming were very well done,. I am planning on ordering a second DVD to give as a Christmas gift.
B007R11PX6|2.0|Sorry my kids lost intrest in this movie 15 Min in it and walked away they are not babys tey 7 and 9
1594203334|5.0|I married a Euro and totally get Druckerman's point of view. I agrree with everything she writes including the part about obsessive Americans looking for the next BEST PARENTING STYLE, when the only real style that matters is the one that's good for you and your baby. I loved this book and read it twice, once while preggo and again when my baby was 2 months. I also would like to mention how her opinions on sleep training were priceless and I don't think it's a coincidence that my baby girl was &#34;doing her nights&#34; (as referred to by Druckerman) by 2 1/2 months. I personally owe it to this book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have not finished this book yet but so far as usual Vince Flynn wrote another great book!! Rap was his old self in the first of the book and I hope he gets back to himself before the end. I hope Mr. Flynn is working on another I just can't get enough of his books!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This was a good read, and kept my interest throughout the book.  I have already recommended this to my family and friends.  The only downfall is that as of right now their is no follow up book, and no real plan of when one will be out. I want more, and look forward to reading the sequel.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Some may not have enjoyed this movie, but they are few and far between.  &#34;Elf&#34; is full of humor, great acting, a good enough plot to keep you interested, and a great color palate/cinematography.  Overall, this is a must-see movie every holiday season, and I highly recommend it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is a great trilogy for a Batman series although there's not enough Batman or Catwoman in it. Catwoman is great in every scene but there isn't many. You hardly see Batman as much and it irritated me. Bane was good, even though his backstory isn't exactly like the comic book. His mask being a thing he needs to keep him alive didn't make much sense, how does he eat with that thing? I hated the ending with that John Blake dude being named Robin and implying he's taking over the mantle. I didn't like the fact that Bruce faked his death in the end and move on with Selina, it leaves Gotham with peace again over another lie just like taking blame over Two Face's crimes. The fight scenes are badass but just that stupid ending irks me.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Why have it if you can't use it. I don't have any problems with FB on any other device, only kindlefire hd. My original fire works fine, phone also, computers & laptop all work fine, just not this app. on this device. I have uninstalled it 3-4 times to see if it was just a bad install, but every time I re-install the app I get the same results with news-feed not working. Very Disappointing...
B00913P6G0|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever listened to.  This is definitely worth your money.  You won't regret it!
B004V2S4SS|4.0|Excellent quality- Will be a keepsake for one of my favorite series of all time.  Will definitely recommend to others
034580404X|5.0|wasn't as  sexual as i thought. I don't know why I was intrigued with this book. Just show,people can and do change for love.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|seemed thrown together, it was okay but not better than the previous one,all the indecision about being batman, dude... just get over it and get on with the show...,my girlfriend pics a pair of shoes quicker.<br />it was okay to rent, but not to buy.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|bought this for my family for christmas so hopefully they like it. they are constantly going on youtube to listen
B008Z9L94O|5.0|If you knew me, then you'd know that I have a massive boner for the Smashing Pumpkins.  I have the Mellon Collie Cd from when it was first released, and I spent a good while searching for the UK vinyl, but wasn't about to pay such an absurd amount of money for it.  When I first read Mellon Collie was being reissued, along with the rest of the Pumpkins catalog, after I cleaned my crap off the floor, I immediately started pestering my local record store about any information they had on it. Finally it came out and I bought both the CD and vinyl because the Pumpkins really are THAT good.<br /><br />I had been checking crestfallen.com regularly for information on the reissues, so I had already seen the box art and knew what I was getting, but for all those who care, it really is something. I hate that it was changed from its original release but, for other like me, you'll be happy to know that the one book that came with the artwork on it in the original release is unchanged, aside from the coloring being much more crisp.<br /><br />The vinyl<br /><br />Laid out over 04 black LPs, the records come with two sleeves, a nice white paper sleeve covered with plastic inside and a colored sleeve (red, blue, green, and yellow) that goes with the feel of the album. Like many people have reported I was pretty disappointed when I reached Zero at the end os side A because it sounded really different, distorted, quiet in some parts and loud in others. It really affected the feel of the album because Tonight Tonight was so beautifully crisp and clear and you could hear how cleaned up Jellybelly was, that it was surprising. It wasn't a deal breaker, just a disappointment. I had hoped that it was just my copy but when I started looking online it was clear that it wasn't.  I played through the rest of the album- except the last side of the last LP because it was clearly damaged,- and everything sounded brilliant.  I did notice that same sort of distortion on Zero was at the beginning ofTales of a Scorched Earth and Thru the Eyes of Ruby.  There have been a lot of talks of pops and clicks through the album; however, on my copy, I didn't hear anything aside from maybe a small pop during Bodies, but it's not going to be perfect, and if I wanted that, I'd have just stuck with the CD. I requested a replacement because of the last LP, but decided Id hang on to it to compare to my replacement.<br />Zero on the replacement sounds much different than on my first copy. Where the first one sounded like the song was sung over white noise, this one did not. Yes, if I listened closely to the track I could make it out, like I said I could on my original CD in a comment to another user, but it was nowhere near what it was when I first listened to it.  While that white noise was much clearer through the \\"emptiness is loneliness\\" part, it sort of fades off when the rest of the band picks back up.  This problem also wasn't as bad as it had been on Tales and Ruby, but Bullet with Butterfly Wings didn't sound as clear as it had on my first copy.<br /><br />The CD<br /><br />The same cases and books come with this as with the vinyl; however, this includes a 04 sheet decoupage kit sealed in a light red envelope, which is really nice. The pictures are beautiful and match the re-imagined artwork, but I don't want to cut it apart to make anything, so we'll move along.  There are 06 discs, the remastered album on 02 CDS as before, 03 bonus discs with different cuts, edits and what-have-yous, and a concert DVD.<br />The original album sounds fantastic and incase you are wondering there are no problems with Zero, but be warned I'm not an audio-snob so maybe there is and my untrained ears just might not be able to pick it out.  Lets talk bonus stuff. I can't even begin to express how much I love the acoustic version of Bullet With Butterfly Wings that is on the album, it's very raw and brings the song to a whole new level. In fact, my sister said she likes that version betterthan the original release, which I can't get behind, but it's definitely up there. There are many full instrumental cuts from different  songs that make up the Pistachio Medley heard on The Aeroplane Flies High, or the Zero EP, and it's incredibly interesting to hear the various demos and see how the songs evolved into their final form.  There are one or two songs that as far as I know haven't been released before like Methusela and Speed, again I could be wrong with that, but I think my favorite extra is the Soundworks demo of Eye.  It's an acoustic version piano version, without the rest of the band, that is just amazing. Compared to what was released on the Lost Highway soundtrack, it's like a completely different song. The concert DVD is nice as well. It's just shy of an hour I think and is 15 songs, 03 of which are from Siamese Dream. Each song is performed wonderfully and it looks like the entire band (Jimmy is there) is having a good time, if that is something that you care about, and I think it may be the best performance of To Forgive I've ever seen.<br /><br />While the few problems I had with my first vinyl were a little bit of a bummer, it didn't make me regret buying the album, and if I were stuck with that copy, I'd still play the crap out of it.  Still if it concerns you, check crestfallen.com for any updates on if this was a manufacturing problem or if it's just how it's supposed to be heard.  It seems like Billy is involved with keeping them up to date with Pumpkins info and I'd imagine if there was, what a recall, they'd post it, or you go just check out the band's website I suppose.  If you wouldn't the CD is probably the way to go. It's split up so you can get either the album, or the album with the bonus stuff, or a digital download of the album and bonus discs, but I'm not sure if the concert is included in that. Which ever way you decide to go, it's clear that Billy spent a lot of time and energy into the remaster.<br /><br />Bring on Adore (my personal favorite)!
B007V65R54|5.0|Loved this book. Takes a rational and unbiased look at so many important subjects. I am a statistician but readers without specific knowledge of mathematics or statistics should be able to understand the book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Never disappointed with a Harry Bosch novel!! I hope he keeps writing more and more, the wait is worth it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. When I turn on my kindle, it always shows up. It shows accurate information, and all of it is useful. Brilliant, just flat out brilliant.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|A song from the group was recommended for me to listen to from a friend. Checked it out as well as their other songs, like what I heard and decided to get the album.  I love the album, the group is expressive and present a different twist to the music scene.
B009CPES4I|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was such a great movie about people, how no matter where we come from or go to, we are at the core all the same - we all want to be loved, to have purpose and know we have made a difference in someone's life.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought a Zoom H4n to record music from a choir that I sing with.  The very first time I used the device at a performance, I was setting it up on a microphone stand in a balcony overlooking the church that we were singing in.  Imagine my horror when the microphone holder that I was using to hold the device suddenly rotated as I was setting it up and the H4n fell about 25 feet to the floor below.  I rushed downstairs, expecting to find my new expensive recorder ruined - but it wasn't.  Fortunately it had not landed on the microphone end - when I turned it on the menu came up and I continued setting it up and making my first recording as planned.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I very much enjoyed the book one of the best I have ever read! It provided a very suspenseful read that I found hard to put down

B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is a gift so will have to see if daughter-in-law likes it but I am impressed. It should prove to be a nice surprise for Christmas.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I d/l this for my KF HD 8.9, but I cannot find it or any trace of it being on my KF.  Can somebody please tell me what to do or how to open it?<br /><br />(I've tried to re-d/l, but it says I already own it.  If I have it can you tell me how to find it? I have tried search and it does not show in my library of apps.)<br /><br />Thank you VERY much in advance!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|This movie was well done. The acting was superb! However, it should have been rated R. Would NOT recommend this movie for children!! The violence and psychological warfare are extreme and should be considered before allowing children to view.
B005TMGXZU|3.0|What a great album, and how unfortunate the first side of this record is marred by very high surface noise. I have multiple copies and it is a problem on most.
1419705849|4.0|Wimpy kid is a great series of books. The only problem is my kids (9 & 12) can read these books in 45 minutes. Oh well, anything to keep them reading.
B003N0XDT4|1.0|At first it seemed like a high-end product, but from the first moment I opened the package, it just went down hill.<br /><br />-Found scratches on the back (not very deep, but still).<br /><br />-Works as USB DAC ONLY.<br />When I first turned it on, the LCD started to blink vigorously, and the battery icon was going crazy. At the beginning I didn't think this was an issue, but then I found out that I couldn't charge the device (no iPhone/portability usage).<br /><br />-Accessories are cheap and low quality.<br /><br />-Had to buy additional cables so it'd work properly with iPhone (which I have no use of, since the product doesn't work).<br /><br />~~~ Package ~~~<br />Looks and feels VERY similar to the iPhone package. Makes a good first impression.<br /><br />~~~ Accesories ~~~<br />1) Line-in to line-in cable - The cheap kind.<br />2) Clear screen protection sticker (not very usable).<br />3) Carrying pouch - Made from harsh-y hairy material which has a damp/moist bad smell (if you ordered some cheapo stuff from DX, you know what I mean).<br /><br />~~~ Product Itself ~~~<br />Feels very lightweight. Doesn't feel very durable.<br />Comes with a removable thin silicone protection skin.<br /><br />~~~ Sound Quality ~~~<br />Since I was only able to connect it to the PC via USB, as a DAC, no iPhone/Line-in tests.<br />Tested it with ATH-M50, and the sound was really good, way better then the on-board sound card. Good bass boost.<br /><br />~~~ Overall ~~~<br />All shiny on the outside, crappy Made In China quality when you actually get to use the product. I'd say that the real value of this product is about 25 USD.

B0096HIEE2|1.0|We all came to the same conclusion. Horrible. Just a bad story line all around. If you're a woman and want to see these men strip, you might like it. Otherwise, horrible.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book by a great author. Tim Ferriss is an interesting cat! The title is misleading for what the book is really about. I really think that a lot more people would buy this book if they knew it was about much more than cooking. I'm trying my best to let everyone know!

It's such a relief to finally read a recent, well-written dystopian novel meant fir adults and not wrapped up in teenage melodrama. So suspenseful and enjoyable.

B008Y2X78S|5.0|While not for everyone because of the nudity and violence, I consider this television show to be the finest acting, plot, costumes and cinematography I have ever seen. I am now in season 3 and look forward to going back through all the episodes.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the &#34;Hunger games&#34; series, however I found the 2nd book in the series was kind of drawn out.  &#34;Mocking jay&#34; brought it back to life.

B005HSL626|4.0|I like fruit ninja.  I'm not expert, super master at it but it's a fun game.  Heck I even play it in Dave and Buster's when I go.  This game is a nice version of the iphone original game.<br /><br />I took one star off because the in game add doesn't show up right on my phone and I just hit close everytime.  Also, I've been told that this version doesn't have a pomegranite at the end of each arcade round, which I didn't even know about until an iphone friend of mine told me.<br /><br />-Motorola Razr Maxx
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack is as cool as they come.  Lee really has a clever take on the murder mystery.  I'm looking forward to the Reacher movie soon.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|I haven't gotten very far into the book yet.....because I am having a hard time getting &#34;into&#34; it.  I keep trying, but my mind keeps wandering so I am tending to scan which I probably shouldn't do, because I am probably missing a lot.  If I don't get &#34;hooked&#34; pretty soon I will probably give up on it.
B00498TQV8|5.0|It seems womean are strong.  The actress was good but sometimes it looked like she had eye makeup on.  That part wasn't real.  But  that movie was good the whole time.

B000002I99|5.0|I like Alice Cooper and wanted to add more of his music to my collection and so far I haven't found any of these songs on other albums so I decide to buy it and I like the album and I have enjoyed listing to it. If you like Alice Cooper than you will like this album. The album tells a story and it's all done by the lyrics.

B005JR47R6|5.0|I've enjoyed this show from the start and this was the last season and I've all read have bought the first seven and this was the last season of House and I just add to buy it to complete my collection. If you liked Housed then you would want to buy the DVD for your collection. Season eight gives you the Swan episode that was the behind the scenes of house and all the work that went into making the show awesome. Even if you don't want to buy all the rest of the season's you should buy this set because of all the extra's that will give you a closer look of the show.

B000002LR6|5.0|I listen to Ministry in high school but never owned one of their albums before so I decide to buy one and I like this album. I like music and decide to expand my music collection and I enjoy this album. If you are into music and want something different them give this band a try.
B00846REIS|3.0|Unbelievably similar to 50 shades of grey. Change of names is about the only difference between them. If you enjoy reading about another fantasy man, this is the book to read.
B0012GMXLU|5.0|I've only hear a few song of theirs because of The WWE and I decide to buy an album and I liked it. I heard of them in high school but never bought any other albums until now and I wish I would have bought their albums years ago. If you never listen to Motor Head and want to try a new band then give this band a try.

1419705849|4.0|Greg Heffley has already survived and lived to tell the tale about six of his previous escapades in middle school. But now, he faces his greatest challenge yet. The student board has decided to hold a Valentine's Day dance, and guess who's getting left out? If you said Greg, then yes, you're right. Will Greg ever manage to find a date and go to the dance, all while surviving the hectic pace of middle school life? Nothing's what it first seems in this seventh instalment in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and remember--all's fair in love and war.<br /><br />Most of us already know what we're getting when we open up a Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, but for those who don't know, what sets this series apart is that there are illustrations to accompany the text inside, so it truly becomes the \\"diary\\" of a Greg Heffley. And Greg himself is part of the reason why the series is so popular--who can resist his dorky, failtastic charm? He's no different here than in any other books, and he will manage to capture the hearts of reluctant readers anywhere.<br /><br />One thing I detest about series is that books can have a tendency to get redundant if the author decides to continuously write new books in the series. Now, this is not to say that The Third Wheel is a complete redundant piece of garbage, but I did feel that this one's plot was very similar to book five, The Ugly Truth. After all, there's only so many middle school scenarios you can write about. However, Mr. Kinney did manage to keep me guessing until the end, and the pacing was decent. I do hope that the series will end sometime soon though--not because I hate it, but because I believe it's time for it to end.<br /><br />Lastly, the humour in this one is not the best, but not the worst in the series either. In fact, overall, this book is not the best nor is the worst in the series. It's just another instalment to help help the series rolling on. Fans will appreciate this new addition, and the book makes a great gift too. The Third Wheel is a nice, quick read for a gloomy day, and it leaves you hungry for more.. The Third Wheel is a nice, quick read for a gloomy day, and it leaves you hungry for more.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Very good insight into the human psyche and how we can grow so terribly apart from ones we love and not know the path back to them. Characters and their feelings were very real; a welcome relief from the violence that seems to be associated with so much writing nowdays; I know it exists but I don't want to ready about it in everything.
B008ODSYZI|5.0|Love this movie!  We must watch it at least twice each Christmas season!  We watch it while the we decorate!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|not only was it slow in the plot line but really? did you you really think robin would know right away who batman was?
1552095258|4.0|First - I am a beginner - so my opinion is beginner's one.<br />Found this book very interesting in reading and useful. Did not try to make any paddles yet (waiting for warmer season) - but will definitely do and hope to have something made following this book. Descriptions are detailed and quite clear.<br />Would recommend it
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I've always loved the movie. With this DVD, I can enjoy the original BW version, which lets the story really shine. This is a beautiful restoration.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I picked this up not too long ago as a FAOTD and had a hard time putting it down.  It's not an incredibly long or complex game, but it stumped me a few times.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003W77SA8|5.0|I'd been looking for this one for awhile, especially when I found out that all of ELO's albums had been remastered.  This &#34;extended&#34; version of New World Record doesn't disappoint.  The original album is intact, and the extra tracks are tacked on to the end, which keeps the integrity of the original recording.  It sounds great!  I'll have to pump up the volume in my car for better effect.  Jeff Lynne is still a brilliant, visionary musician, songwriter and producer, and ELO was a massive part of my teenage years--this album especially.  And I couldn't believe the price.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I now have all but the last movie in the series, and love this movie series, so I'm not complaining at all.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Perfect!  Quick shipping. Thanks so much for the easy transaction. I would definitely do business with this seller again. Thanks.
B001RIYOTM|5.0|I purchased this in response to seeing a fabulous staging of the play for the holidays.  The script was supposed to be taken almost directly from the novella so I wanted to read it for myself.  Excellent writing that stands up to this day.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I had read Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and really enjoyed it.  So I bought this one thinking it should be just as good.  It did not disappoint.  Ms. Flynn holds your interest throughout the story and shows great imagination while the ending builds up to an unexpected finale.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Used this CPU on my last build, with an ASUS mb, a 1TB HDD and an SSD as a cache, utilizing the Intel Rapid Storage Technology feature. This CPU actually outperforms my last build which included the i7 2600K CPU, which is 2nd generation, and of course this is 3rd. Speed of performance is faster, and this CPU features Intel Graphics 4000 as opposed to the 2600K which has the Graphics 3000, so even the graphics are somewhat better. I had always preferred i7 CPU's in the past, but this one convinced me that, for the difference in price, the i7 performance is not that much better than this i5. I do a lot of HD and Bluray transcoding and the encoding time is the fastest that I've experienced yet. For the money, this is a very good CPU. The stock cooler is very good for all but the most demanding applications, but I suppose that if someone, such as a heavy duty gamer, overclocks a lot, an aftermarket cooling solution might be better. All-in-all, I don't regret choosing this CPU, in any way
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! Great show,with perfect clear image and sound! And an even more perfect cover and undercover! Everyone should have it...
1439153663|5.0|If you read nothing else, ever, you need to read this book!  A very important look into history, a gripping and gritty, beautiful deep story.  Definitely one of my top 10 reads yet!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Having been a huge fan of Chris Nolan's previous two Batman films, couldn't wait to watch this when it was released. And The Dark Knight Rises didn't disappoint. The conclusion to the trilogy is fitting for the franchise, for Batman, and for Bruce Wayne (though I have read rumors that Nolan might come back for another film in the series or maybe a Batman/Superman film - hope some of this is true!).<br /><br />The film starts with a frail Bruce Wayne having pretty much retired and living a private life eight years after he eliminated the Joker. The peaceful Gotham City where police officers feel they will soon be \\"chasing overdue library books\\" is rocked by a series of events orchestrated by the ferocious and calculating villain, Bane.<br /><br />The pace of this film is slightly slower (and heavier) compared to the previous two films, partly because there are a lot more characters in this film, and Nolan being the master storyteller that he is, gives each character enough time in the film. It could seem a bit lengthy at 3 hours of thereabout because of this. Lucius Fox and Alfred return in their usual roles of being Batman's brains and soul respectively. Michael Caine's performance as Alfred is simply remarkable even though his screen time is somewhat limited in the film. Christian Bale, as usual, has done a great job portraying the battles within Bruce Wayne - overcoming his hears and rising from being as good as dead to come back to save his beloved city. His character comes a full circle from the first film as Thomas Wayne's words \\"why do we fall down Bruce\\" echo through this film and Bruce seemingly understands their meaning here as he prepares to pick himself up and \\"rise\\".<br /><br />New characters added a refreshing touch to the series. Anne Hathaway is brilliant in her role as Selina Kyle. She lightens up the serious macho overdose of the film with her flair and flamboyant ways. Bane, with links to the League of Shadows, brings a dark element unlike any Gotham has witnessed before. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays John (Robin) Blake perhaps a younger version of Jim Gordon. He seems to be set to take over the reins from Commissioner Gordon, but eventually chooses to stay free of the shackles imposed by structure and protocols by the GCPD. Marion Cotillard (I thought she was brilliant in Inception) plays a convincing partner and love interest of Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />The conclusion is definitely a lot heavier in terms of content and pace compared to the previous two films. This film requires focused attention to the dialogue and sequence of events, previous 2 films seem somewhat lighter compared to this one. The fact that Bane's voice was muffled with his mask doesn't help in this regard, it only increases the level of focus one needs to have which watching the film. In addition, the film has more characters with their place in the film. Chris Nolan has spent a fair amount of time with each character to fully bring out their roles and let the audiences savor the nuances of their personalities, inner conflicts, and goals. I personally think the editing room could have shaved off a good 15 to 20 minutes from the film, but this is Nolan's signature style of storytelling. Also some scenes make Batman seem too human, like the street fight scene with Bane towards the end. Batman is a superhero and it feels somewhat strange to see him battle his enemy bare hands in the middle of a street-fight. That being said, there are plenty of new toys in his arsenal and the Bat, in particular, is awesome!<br /><br />Yes, the performance of Heath Ledger and the compelling storytelling of The Dark Knight are hard to match, but TDKR is an appropriate and epic conclusion to what I think is one of the best series of super-hero films made to date.am has witnessed before.

B007THA4FI|3.0|This dark, rather predictalbe novel depressed me all the way through.  I realise that it si an adult novel and would have none of the charm and excitement of the Harry Potter series, but did it have to have such miserable characters?  If J&#62;K&#62; does another, I hope she finds a cheerful village next time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Phenomenal series of books! And I haven't read a book since 1997! I could get use to reading again with books like these.

B007XHWROK|5.0|awesome stocking stuffer for the Bieber fan in my family. Glad I purchased it during Black Friday. Get your copy now!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|First off, I will be comparing this blu-ray to the Avengers bluray considering both are in the same caliber of movie.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Deep blacks in picture quality<br />-1 hour documentary of the batmobile spanning from the comics, to burton, all the way to the tumblr.<br />-Amazing IMAX scenes that pop out on a good theatre system.<br />-Hans Zimmers score shines through a good surround sound system<br /><br />Cons:<br />-If you dont have a nice, large tv with good picture quality, than you wont be able to appreciate the IMAX scenes and cinematography.<br />-If you dont have a good sound system or headset, the music can drown out some of the quieter dialogue.<br />-In infamous Nolan fashion, it is skimp on audio commentary and deleted scenes. (both of which Nolan has a history of doing)<br />-Ultraviolet proves to be a pain in the ass and while may be streamed to any device, cannot be used through iTunes. The registration and streaming process is a hassle and proved frustrating. Don't depend on this for the digital copy.<br /><br />While there is more cons than pros, this bluray is the standard for this movie and as a huge batman fan and bluray-phile, this is still a great pick up. Note: I feel like WB is holding back on another special/collector's edition that has all three movies again, but with more special features perhaps. Either that or they missed an oppurtunity to make a definitive TDKR release on bluray.<br /><br />Must buy for batman or comic book fans, regardless of how you felt about the movie.
B004XQO90O|1.0|I'm sorry, but this is simply shameful propaganda. What's the premise? We must FEAR and SUSPECT everyone. There are potential bombs and terrorists EVERYWHERE. So we should accept the notion of guilty until proven innocent. Therefore it is right and just to attack and torture anyone whether innocent or not to get the info needed. The means justify the ends.<br /><br />First he suspects the minorities and then the white guys. We must learn. Now we're all SUSPECTS.<br /><br />And we're made to accept this because it's in a MOVIE and not real. But when it roles out in reality, we've accepted it, because we saw it in a movie.<br /><br />Source Code will go down in history as the equivalent of a TERRIBLE Red Scare movie, just translate to the bogeyman al-Qaida into this.<br /><br />Communists were everywhere (Red Scare).<br />Terrorists are everywhere (post-9/11).<br /><br />Awful propaganda. Shame on the director and participants in this propaganda piece. It's NOT entertainment. It's programming.
B000L212HC|5.0|considering Nolan has a great track record, it says alot when this movie is deemed one of the best out of his catalog. even though he is notorious for not having audio commentaries or a slew of special features, the movie itself is a must watch with an incredible twist.

Thanks for making it into a TV shows, because honestly if I was told to read the whole 4 books, I would fall asleep after 4 pages.
1451696191|5.0|Love this book! I've read it several times. Can't wait to see the movie. Recommend this book to people who like journal type writing.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is one of the best things that's ever been on TV ... right up there with Sopranos, Deadwood, and such.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I love this backpack, it holds my 17 inch laptop, my Galaxy Tab 10.1, phone, Ipod and about a dozen other things I carry around with me for work and school. it comfortable to wear and looks great. Great buy !
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Everybody should watch this movie it is an enlightening accurate depiction of the facts surrounding Kennedy's Assassination with a companion published book of sources it is certainly the most historically accurate film hollywood has come out with to date.
B0087HT36U|5.0|So much fun! I have enjoyed numerous replays and even hooked my kids...Best game since Crush The Castle and more addicting. Bring on the Cowboys
0425263916|5.0|Liked it as much as or better than 50 Shades. Very simular to 50 so if you liked it you will like this series.
6305428042|5.0|This is anold favorite of mine and I'm sending it off to my great niece as a stocking stuffer at Xmas.  Bette and the girls are a hoot!
0425263908|5.0|Both books in this series are fantastic. I look forward to reading the 3rd book and have pre-ordered it. Come on May!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The best version of this wonderful story I have ever seen and i have seen many versions. I would recommend this for all ages, my 10 year old and 15 year old nieces loved it as well as my husband...
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Just when I think a major character is dead, I read a little farther along and bam ,I find out they are alive! A lot of death concerning major characters in this book - Really hated to see that! Got really bored reading about the minor characters in the book - really could care less about them - wanted to know what was going on with all of the Starks!  Ready for Book 4 - Can't wait to see what happens next!!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|👍👍 this is definitely a &#34;two thumbs up&#34; read! Tim has progressed from good, to really good, and now great with his third 4 Hour installment! More than passive reading, this is a manual with a workbook built right in. Genuine and straightforward, it is inspiring, instructional, funny and life changing! How to do &#34;anything better&#34;, is really the heart of his advice!<br />I recommend this highly!
1454701250|5.0|Well organized book with great photographs that describes the process of making your own rubber stamps and using them creatively.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love this product because it has online backup. The only bad thing about this app is that it can't  sync with dropbox.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|well im pretty new to amazon all together and have only bought 2 games on here so far. i received one and it was in terrible condition and i havnt even gotten a response from the one selling it..but heroes was in perfect condition and runs smoothly. i really enjoy being able to play this game again since i havnt been able to since i was a little kid and im grateful to have found it on here for so cheap. all in all..it was a pretty good experience compared to the other game i bought and im now looking for more old games from my childhood :)
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The princess of a clan has to marry a prince from another clan. She doesn't want to so she tries to find a way to change her destiny. Unfortunately, it backfires on her in the worst way and puts her mother's life in danger. My teenage sons and I enjoyed it.
0547884591|5.0|Thanks to Tim Ferriss and his new book The 4-Hour Chef, I just had a delicious meal. His recipes, at least the first few have a huge MOE (margin for error), and limited ingredients, but the results are delicious. I've been experimenting with spiced scramble eggs all week and am having a blast - giving my wife a different \\"gourmet flavor combo\\" every morning. For dinner, I just made \\"Jude's Chuck Roast\\" in my crock pot (I adjusted the recipe slightly - I added a package of sliced baby portebella mushrooms, 5 cloves of smashed garlic and a small sliced onion). I served it with \\"Coconut Cauliflower Curry Mash\\" - but I didn't have coconut milk so I replaced with low-fat cow's milk. I put in too much milk, but that was OK I just used a strainer to get rid of the excess liquid. Huge MOE, remember? The result? A home cooked meal that was absolutely amazing! I can't believe how delicious it was and how freaking easy. If you eat, you need to buy this book. If your friends eat, buy them a copy. I suddenly love to cook!
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Really? Do I really need to write a review about Monty Python and The Holy Grail?! It's a spoof movie about knights and their quest for the Holy Grail. All these years my sisters and I have used lines from the movie. Now that my boys are teenagers and watched the movie, they finally understand what their Mom has been saying all the years...and discovered that she's actually funny. Monty Python. Watch it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This works seemlessly and is very addictive!!<br />Good for all ages.  Lots of fun.<br />Recommended for everyone.<br />Three more words?  I'm enjoying it.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I haven't seen it, but my 13-year-old and his friends love it. It was freaky when the Joker dresses thugs up as Batman.
B009H442DG|5.0|Knowing that this was a much-hyped reunion for John & Olivia (aka, Danny & Sandy), I knew this CD was going to be fun, fun, fun! And it was exactly what I anticipated. Olivia sounds as good as ever with that fabulous one-of-a-kind voice...a singer who happens to be able to act, and John sounds just like he did in Grease...an actor who happens to be able to sing! Both artists did this project for their respective charities, and we the listeners are treated to a holiday delight. Familiar songs recorded in the total spirit of holiday joy and Christmas delight! You cannot listen to this recording and not smile. The listener can tell that John & Olivia are true friends who had an absolute blast with this project! The biggest (albeit, cheesiest!) delight is the original \\"I Think You Might Like It.\\" Surely, by now everyone has heard this gem or seen the viral video, or both! I sing it and sing it and sing it all day long! The melody is addictive like none other! Of course, there are other guilty pleasures...Jingle Bell Rock, Baby, It's Cold Outside, Winter Wonderland, Silent Night, and so much more....plus amazing guest artists. Buy this CD and discover them for yourself!
B000ID37RM|4.0|My high school student had to read this book. He has difficulty with reading comprehension. He listened to the audiobook and then watched the movie. It's difficult from the book - and we discussed that - but it was helpful for him to remember the story.
1608193381|4.0|A great approach to showing the complexity and contradictions behind the &#34;free market&#34; cliches. In a way, it mirrors the method of St. Thomas by stating the free market &#34;orthodoxy&#34; and then examining the assumptions and facts to arrive at a more valid understanding.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|This is a strong freshman set by this Colorado folk group.  \\"Dead Sea\\" is my favorite track on the set with its unique melody and the determined guitar strum counterpointed by the strings, \\"There are times when we live for somebody else; Your father died and you decided to live it for yourself.\\"  \\"Ho Hey\\" jumps out of the speakers with its chorus shout and catchy hook, \\"I belong to you; You belong to me in my sweet heart.\\"  The under-two-minute opener \\"Flowers in Your Hair\\" grabs the attention, \\"It takes a boy to live; It takes a man to pretend he was there.\\"  Other tracks like \\"Big Parade\\" & \\"Charlie Boy\\" are also gems.  This set holds a lot of promise.  Enjoy!
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This guy can keep me glued to the story-loved this one after DaVinci ...Symbol; out of sequence for me, but lookin' forward to next.
B008RZHAAS|2.0|I am very interested in electronic music, but this record was a bit head banging.  Repetitious and a little dull.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Overall it's not bad. Especially for a Kindle version. It's still a good game to play despite the fact it doesn't have everything the xbox or Pc versions have. Land masses are decent and survivor mode and creation mode are done very well. There is one glitch the seems problematic though. Sometimes the game will reset your kindle and your survivor game will sometimes be lost or turned into a creation mode game. that part can be frustrating.  But overall four out of five. If not for the occasional glitches it would of earned five. it's still worth the price if you love minecraft.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Installed this game on my 8 year olds Kindle Fire. Just got my monthly statement and discovered the game had charged near $100 in \\"Coin Packs\\" for him to continue playing/advance to new levels!!!!! WHAT A RIP-OFF!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was not only well acted, but was a very interesting story line for an old fairy tale.  The visuals were fantastic.  The PG 13 rating was accurate as I wouldn't recommend this film for younger children due to the dark nature of the setting.  This is not your childhood story.  It was highly entertaining and Charlize Theron was an excellent wicked witch, and Kristen Stewart's interpretation of Snow White was unusual and charming.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A great read from start to finish. The story grabs you and then you become invested in the characters. You turn the page to see if the characters wake up and see their situation, how will they become united, etc..
B000FBJAOG|2.0|It was funny for the first twenty pages and then the novelty wore off quickly. Plus now Amazon thinks I'm a huge zombie head and my recommendations are ruined.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|this works well for what i need it to do.  sometimes the download button doesn't show up so you need to exit and get back in.
B003TT2X72|1.0|This is not the extended version as stated in the blurb. It is very disappointing to me, as I have seen the extended version on DVD. Amazon needs to be more careful in matching descriptions to the project. The fact that comments on a product are shared across different version of the same title, makes it very confusing.
B004UID2LC|4.0|awesome app as it can download videos as a video or as an mp3 file.  however, i don't know if it is pulling up all youtube videos.  i've not been able to find some videos on here that is available on youtube.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|Brilliant WAP.  It supports multiple SSIDs with different security algorithms and bandwidth loading if you want it.  Its got MAC filtering and lets face it, its a Cisco so it going to perform and its going to be secure.  I use it on a Cisco 880 to give me my wireless access while my secure work-network is wired, isolated from wireless access behind ACLs in the 880.  I get full bandwith and performance and stream TV without any dropouts.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|This album is amazing, and all I listen to anymore. Great purchase! Definitely check it out! I would buy it again if I had to.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm hooked on this TV series.....you will be too!  Stayed up until 2 watching this. I bought one for my dad and he is now a huge walking dead fan. Can't wait to see the next seasons!
0316227706|5.0|These are just great photos! Kudos to the photographer for coming up with a very novel idea. Just fun. Hilarious! [...]
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting and challenging. Just when you think your spatial reasoning is up to the task, you'll get stumped. Then you'll kick yourself later for not seeing the solution. Before you know it you're buying more levels and neglecting your chores.
159562015X|4.0|Great book, but the copy I received was tiny, like the size of a paperback fiction novel. Where are the standard sized copies of this????
B0053O89WY|5.0|My family has loved Big Bang since it first started & that has not changed.  It does not matter if they change the story line or add new characters.  The show is great.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Good quality, no frills, single disc edition. Just a DVD, no special features or anything. Plastic wrapped. Good quality, and condition.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Better than I ever could have imagined! What a life that poor boy lived. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|On of the most disappointing things about my droid devices have been their calculators, but this app has resolved all the issues I`'ve had. GREAT APP!!!!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved reading this! It kept my attention the whole way through. I enjoyed each character and what they added to the story.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I watched this on the advice of a friend who swore I'd like it, when I thought it would be a silly and low budget type movie.  This is absolutely one of those few I was wrong about!  The story was 'plausible' in an imaginary way, although there was a LOT to cram into a two hour movie.  But the special effects were OVER THE TOP, making up for anything lacking somewhere else.  Fresh idea done in a big way!  Kudos!
B007L6VR12|5.0|The Royal Tenenbaums was very good; Moonrise Kingdom is beautifully great.<br /><br />Wes Anderson took a story that romanticizes childhood yet injects some hard truths of real life -- parents that don't love each other, a child kicked out of his foster home, a sad middle-aged policeman, a young difficult girl, self-important scout leaders -- and does it all in an uplifting and very artistic way.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine just getting the basic plot and dialog right to pull off such a feat without coming across as syrupy, a downer, leave-it-to-Beaverish, overplayed, underplayed, etc.  Yet he not only did that, he added such wonderful cinematic (and very Wes Anderson) visuals along with the story, layered with all sorts of subtle recurring themes and inspired musical choices.<br /><br />I'm a pretty stoic guy, but it's hard for me not to slightly tear-up in the end when the young man slips out the window with \\"Cuckoo\\" being sang by the boys' choir -- both tying up a recurring theme of the movie while so perfectly ending the work of art that is this film.<br /><br />I so truly admire Wes for creating something so original, so beautiful, so sweet yet so hard, so multi-layered, so artistic, just so plain enjoyable to watch again and again.<br /><br />I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Funny, suspenseful, great effects, better acting than most science fiction movies, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would from the previews
1439153663|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.<br />The story matter is difficult ( slavery) but the author, while revealing the cruelty and brutality of  plantation life, chooses to focus more on the warmth and endearing love within the slave families.<br />It tells the important tale of a young Irish girl who comes to live on the plantation as an indentured servant after her parents and a brother die on board the ship headed to America. Her surviving brother is sold and she never sees him again.  Even at six years of age, she is considered a servant. She becomes a part of the slave family and they love her as family, despite her very white skin and red hair.<br />When she marries the cruel son of the plantation owner, his demands that she act as the &#34;mistress of the plantation&#34; conflicts with  her enduring love for her adoptive family. This inner conflict is clearly portrayed by the author who has developed her characters to the fullest.  You fall in love with them and for a time are living with them.<br />As a history buff, I found her research to be excellent. Indentured servitude is not an area usually covered in novels and the author has researched her topic well. Southern accents sound authentic.  I hesitate to call this a &#34;page-turner&#34; because that would trivialize the story.  Instead, I would say that the author writes in such a way that you hesitate to put this book down and look forward to picking it up again.<br />I anxiously await Kathleen Grisson's next book.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Received my package quicker then I excepted. Came wrapped and undamaged. Price was cheaper then most websites I had looked at.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|the words are so real,this is my second CD from John,heard his songs so many years ago,touch's my being,glad i am still here to enjoy them,even my friends are touched by the lyrics as they have been there,memories,good an bad.i love the sound of his voice.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I want to thank the creators of this game.... you are turning me into someone with no life by having this game!!! Just kidding! In all honesty this game is quite amazing!!! And $0.99 is a great price for it! If only the Spiderman game was that price....<br /><br />You have me thinking about buying Spiderman for $6.99 but watch when I do the price goes on sale!!!! Anyway this is the BEST game on my kindle fire hd! You should all buy this.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Bought this for my son who is a big fan of this series. He was very happy with the set! Shipped quickly.
1451695187|4.0|Books (yes, bought several as gifts) came on time and the read was enjoyable. At times slow & medical but eclipsing to the end!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy this game its fun.<br />I am a gamer because I play a lot of games.<br />It needs more updates like.<br />track<br />creepers<br />mine marts.
1401201911|4.0|good book.  very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly..
0345529057|5.0|Exactly as shown. Shrink wrap sealed. perfect condition for Xmas gift. This searies was recommended to me for my son.
B008RV5K4U|4.0|good movie.  I was used to the other animation & voices for batman but Weller does a efficent job.  looking forward to more
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I didn't like it. Found it very boring. I would not recommend it especially for tablet use. I found it just as boring through Facebook
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|The rating is not for the movie.  the movie is excellent.  the rating is for the condition.  it was sent in a CD case not the original case.  then I believe it was probably a rental as it has markings on it to that effect
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think that survivalcraft is a great minecraft follow up.  It's almost the same and cheaper but my one big complaint on the demo is the time you get.  I mean like every time I play I have  to start a new file.  &quot;It's like come on all my stuff was on that last file!&quot; I really think they should have let you have more time before the file would expire.
B0034G4P80|4.0|very good dvd.  this movie explains out the legend of thor from start to finish.  good adaptation although slow starter, it picks up very qucik once the characters are clarified
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is a good story about kids and adults, courage, loyalty, and resourcefulness. The film looks retro but the truths work today. All the acting is good.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is fun for kids.  It's a time release game.  To complete some of the tasks there needs to be social aspect but it doesn't work at all.  They definately should fix that.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This was a well done and honestly quite disturbing documentary about the dangers of fracking.  Its quite sad that we put people's lives in danger as well as destroy our precious environment just for the sake of being able to get more fossil fuels.  I'm really not surprised that our federal government allowed this to happen.  This corruption must be stopped! Apparently Cheney pushed the bill that allowed fracking to start in the US all while exempting fracking from having to follow current EPA regulations, including the safe water act.  The documentary literally shows people from all over the US turning their kitchen faucets on, placing a lighter near the water and the water stream goes up in flames!!  So sad...  These pollutants they pump into the ground during the fracking process are not biodegradable.  i.e. They will stay there forever and contaminate whatever they come in contact with.
B0083I90HU|5.0|This to is a good read.  I had a little problem when it switched from past to present,, other than that, the book was very interesting.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A great read! Loved the characters and felt like I was living this part of history. Can't wait to read next Ken Follet !
B008ADSDHQ|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed ALL of Jo Nesbo's books.  This was my least favourite only because I had not started to read them in order.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My book club assigned this. I couldn't get past the third chapter. I usually don't write reviews on books I haven't read entirely, but if it's so badly written, you are forcing yourself through three chapters then have to stop or you'll tear your eyes out, it deserves this review.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|I've never heard of Bat For Lashes or Natasha Khan.  She's from England and I guess very popular there.  I bought this because Amazon thought I would like it (based on my past purchases.)  I also love the cover photo.  The music and her singing is just beautiful!  I ordered her other two CDs, can't wait to get them. She truly has the voice of an angel.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|This is the only game so far that I have been unable to download.  I have tried for days and i give up.  If you have a kindle fire don't buy this game
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|This movie did not work in 3D on my LG 3D Blu-ray player. Called LG and they said it was a bad disc. I think the player just would play older 3D movies. I returned the disc and ordered a new one. Have not got new disc yet.

0316023744|5.0|As most readers have already expressed plenty of justified praise for Mr. Beevor's latest book, there is little that can usefully be added. This is a splendid book, written by an outstanding historian in full mastery of his subject. Any one with a serious interest in WW II should read it, for instance because it gives a new perspective to the \\"pre-Pearl Harbor\\" events in Asia. China was at war and had been ravaged in part long before the German invasion of Poland and one of the merits of the book is to illustrate vividly how the war, far from extending to Asia, probably started there in many ways. The writing is elegant and crisp, the author's contempt for some military leaders - Montgomery in particular - very entertaining and the final chapters captivating in their crisp description of the final months of the war.<br />This beeing said, there are three things I found very annoying, but they are to be blamed on the publisher and not on the author ! Firstly the maps: they are useful but again and again I caught myself looking up a place - not an insignificant one - mentioned in the text only to curse whoever drew the map because the city or the river one I was looking for was not on the map...... What is the point of providing a map at all if the reader has to look up places on Google Maps anyway ?<br />Secondly, there is no bibliography in the book. You have to go to &lt;...> to find it. It is there all right and you can print it but one of the pleasures of a good history book is to flip through the bibliography, spotting other books one might get and read but you can hardly do that on a computer screen. The saving to the publisher - if that was the reason - must have been minimal. Again, what is the point ?<br />Thirdly, the footnotes. In the old days, books had footnotes at the bottom of the page. They were easy to check while reading. Then publishers started to put the footnotes at the end of the book for some reason, forcing the reader to use two bookmarks or to forget about the footnotes, although they too are part of the pleasure of a good history book. The publisher of Mr. Beevor's latest book has invented a new form of torture: the \\"footnotes\\" are at the end of the book, but without numbers and without any indication in the text that after a particular sentence there may be a reference and/or a footnote. In other words, one has to guess that this or that statement is probably backed up by a reference worth checking and jump to the end of the book to find out..... This is extremely frustrating to say the least and one can only hope that the practice will be abandoned in future.the footnotes, although they too are part of the pleasure of a good history book.

B0091REZMW|4.0|good game. good time waster when you are just feeling lazy. wish there would be more options to restore energy
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|This movie is jammed pack full of clever one liners, laugh out loud moments, and thought provoking moments.  A perfect melody of funny, smart, sexy, and independent.  When I first saw the cover, I thought blah, another teen movie.  Yes this movie takes place in a high school, but it is nothing like all those horrible teen horn movies out there.  This movie is about a girl wrongly accused and labeled who takes matters into her own hands.<br /><br /> Olive (Emma Stone) is a slightly nerdy, clever girl who never gets in any trouble.  She tells a small white lie to a friend, that is overheard by the wrong person.  Before she knows it, she is fully labeled as &#34;easy&#34; and compares herself to  THE SCARLET LETTER.<br /><br />While this movie has some clever use of language and refers to sex a lot, I would still consider it an excellent movie for older girls (preteens)/teens.  There is a clear message here about being true to yourself.  Please watch it first to make sure you are comfortable with the references.

B002VWNICW|5.0|This is one of the better Hollywood productions of a Jane Austen classic.  It was filmed beautifully and has a great script.
B004SDEP38|2.0|I had the iPhone version which did allow you to edit documents in the free version, and charged you for the ability to use &#34;Sky Drive.&#34;<br /><br />Didn't like it
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is a movie that will be appreciated for years to come.  The only way to watch this movie is blu ray.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|awwwwwwwww yeaaaaahhhhhh<br />I would recommend for anyone. more games would be nice.. ball game and applebucking get boring after a while
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is my favorite production of the Jane Austen classic.  The acting was excellent and the BBC did a great job on the cast.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A little too much wisecracking but the history of Yemen makes it a good read. DeMille  writes well and this part of the world is of particular interest these days.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|A lot of people are probably just being introduced to this comic book hero.  They did an excellent job on this one.
B009LA1R34|5.0|Can't stop listening to it ;-)<br />It's amazing. I think this is one of my favorites album from Thalia's career.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Watching any of the Harry Potter movies in anything but blu ray is a waste of time.  This is much easier to see in blu ray because of the darkness of the production.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Actually saw this movie on HBO and when finished watching it, went right to Amazon to order copies for friends.  It is a great movie along with the others by same studio.<br />Has a great message
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I was so surprised to be able to see this movie so much more clearly in blu ray.  It made for easy watching.
B002QY9RMA|4.0|I have bought yesterday this CD (not on Amazon) and i finished to listen to it entirely with great attention, while reading your reviews. I can say i am satisfied to buy it, Halo (the reason that led me to the shop)is one of the most wonderful songs i ever heard and it is related to an happy period of my life. Listening to Halo makes me happy. If there was only Halo in the cd it would be worthy for me.<br /><br />I must say that the version i have is one CD, not two, even if it is the deluxe edition. If there were two cd i can say the second (from Single Ladies and on) CD should remain forever in the box, while the first CD with the ballads will be listened by me often in the future, i am sure.<br />Halo remains the n.1, but i love also If i was a boy and Disappear.<br /><br /> So, my rate is: very good for the first part, one star or less for the second part, i didn't like it at all.<br /><br />  p.s. sorry, i am italian and i never write in english, but i understand it better than i write, if someone wants to answer me.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My children and so into the Marvel comic movies and this is one of the best.  It's just a great film.

B004EPZ07U|5.0|I have found the filming and storyline of this movie to be quite fascinating.  I am really getting into the Marvel characters.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is the kind of book for me. It really showed how the President gets help and accomplishes his job.  I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in government
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie looks.  I waited until they restored the movie before buying it on blu ray.  Good decision as it looks great!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Well written great story tied to historical event. Give insight into torld politics and tied to well developed story. Hard to put down
B001KEHAI0|5.0|We have had this movie on dvd since it came out.  I love the improved visual with the blu ray.  One of Murray's best.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grisham novel easy read- good writing and  I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to all my friends
B004LWZW4C|5.0|We just love all of the X-Men movies.  This one is going to end up being a real classic over the years.
0345803493|1.0|pages in the book were missing or torn and could not be read. I was really diasppointed with the quality of this book.
B005AUWY90|4.0|This is not quite as good as the original but I love the storyline and it does well as a sequel.
0345803507|1.0|pages in book were missing or torn. was really disappoiunted in quality of book. waste of my money and time.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|If you are a Jurassic Park fan, this is a must have for your movie collection.  It's a great set.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|This is one of the best &#34;more traditional&#34; tales available and has a true European flavor. We originally saw it in original language with sub titles and we had hoped for this option with this film but alas, NOT the American release!
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|So glad Lego has finally come out with a line of products for girls!  This set is huge!  My girls love it!
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|Though this is now old news, this is a pretty decent movie for watching with family during the Christmas season.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|We jujst love this and if you need to laugh thru the stress of the holiday's this film will take you there!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Can't go wrong with a Pixar movie! Funny, smart, cute, and executed perfectly. Exactly what I would have expected from Pixar.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I Love my Cd! I Love Michael B! I listen to it all the time and will definitely recommend it!!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Once agan, Stephen King delivers an excellent story, using an imaginative plot device regarding time travel and the assassination of JFK.  The plot draws upon rich contextual references while depicting a taut, suspenseful storyline involving love, violence, and small town drama, as it churns towards its penultimate depiction of the possible perturbation of the murder of a president as its raison d'etre.<br /><br />The basic storyline involves a high school English teacher who per chances upon an opportunity to change history by stopping the assassination of JFK.  The hook is that the protagonist must enter into past time in the fall of 1958 and thus wait 5 years in &#34;real time&#34; in order to exact his desired affect.  It is the interim time that concerns most of the novel.<br /><br />Without spoiling any of the details, the 5 years the lead character spends abiding in the past become, in fact, the best years of his life.  They are filled with love, loss, drama, and growth.  Somewhat reminiscent of another Stephen King story, &#34;Stand by Me,&#34; the narrator rolls out a tale of pure Americana of the times, containing everything from Lindy hop, the Cuban mafia, the Soviet missile crisis, Sadie Hawkins dances, adolescent drinking, and the early de-segregation movement.  It is here where the author shines most, excelling in the small ball of intimate details and personal horrors.  The development of the love story between the main character (Jake/George) and Sadie is perhaps Mr. King's best depiction of such throughout his work, probably because it seems so unhurried and realistic.<br /><br />Soon enough however, the story is caught up in the grand movement, of preventing the death of one of the author's favorite historical figures.  I won't reveal if the attempt is successful, but albeit to say the last quarter of the book loses some of the storyline coherence as it catapults from the sphere of intensely personal relationships (love and loss and all that comesbetween) to the metaphysical realm of time travel, paradox, and the future of the universe writ large.  While I understand that Mr. King feels the need to tie all of his novels back to the same &#34;common&#34; universe that is inhabited by &#34;The Stand&#34; and the Gunslinger series, in this case it feels belabored and supplementary at best.<br /><br />Ultimately, 11/22/63 is a fine piece of storytelling, which manages to pull off the improbable, that is to say, maintaining suspense while telling a story that has been told so many times before.  For those too young to remember, it turns history into drama, and for those who do so remember the dark day in question, it introduces an element of magic realism that at once both humanizes an American idol while answering the ultimate question of that day, &#34;What If?&#34;<br /><br />Highly recommended as an entertaining and educational piece of uniquely American fiction.  If you are not a Stephen King fan, it stands alone as a fine piece of storytelling.  For those well versed in the universe of Mr. King, it also serves as yet another entry into canon as well.  Happy Reading, dear reader!
B0063IH60K|4.0|really pleased that I  have downloaded this game hours of fun and for free!<br />would say it's a must for those who enjoy time to chill
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I have had nothing but trouble with my order for this movie...first I received the wrong movie..I ordered the version with Daniel Craig and was sent the Swedish version. When I called your customer service I was told the correct movie would be sent out  (over nighted) at no cost to me..and a return label would be e-mailed to me right away..the next day..no return label and no movie...I called again and the person I talked to told me the distributor had noted not to send the return label as it was just the packaging was incorrect, and the movie was the right one...NOT SO. Received the return label and yesterday received the movie.. opened it this morning and the packaging is correct but the movie is a boot leg..it is copied on a Sony DVD-R disk and the title is hand written on the disk.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|Kinda of boring if you want a movie with a realistic plot. It had some comical points, but is better suited for kids.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I so adore the passion Macklemore injects into his music. this Is a wonderful CD. (I also has it on my ITunes. :)
B003ES61EE|4.0|I think they tried to make a lower cost alternative to the Nikon LensPen. This product is ok, good to have in a pinch to get that stubborn piece of dust or fingerprint off the lens. I find that the back cap falls off easily and I feel that the brush should retract further into the pen body to keep it cleanest. Far better than using your t-shirt or sleeve on the lens and a handy tool to keep in your camera bag, but next time I will go for the Nikon pen.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I liked this movie. I watch it over and over and still like it.  It might seem corney but I think it is a good movie. I even like the old truck, and her old standard car.  The ending is pretty good too and not what I expected. The creature was like the  Mothman....two thumbs up.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can't seem to put this game down, it seems to never get old . I even added it to my favorites!!!
B00AJIYPQ8|5.0|I am always in awe of this show. I am sad that Sarah Gamble stopped writing for the show and I was worried what that would mean for this season. I am quite pleased with the way the show is going, especially after Bobby is gone. That is a character that will always be irreplacable. I still stand by my view that nothing can be as good as the first five seasons, but I am happy that the creators are able to keep my interest and have stuck to the character developement of the Winchesters. I am a loyal fan and will continue to watch every week. Supernatural is still my number one....
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't like the ending.  I thought the ending would be better with Amy getting what she deserved. A life in prison.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|I am rating this cd from a perspective of today's rap albums being released. This is probably one of the worst albums released of Tupac but it's still on a whole different level compared to the s*** these fake ass artists release nowadays. This is why i rate it 5 stars. Now had this been the nineties with Pac still alive I am sure this s*** would have never been released because it is far from finished. I would still buy this over any Lil Gayne, Gay-Z, or Kangay West album any day.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Before this update, it was working fine.  Now, all I get it a black background with Amazon search bar on top and that doesn't work either.
B009DKFST6|3.0|I was very excited to get this new CD from one of my favorite artists.  However, I was disappointed.  I missed some of the classic Latin music mixed with hip hop that is Pitbull.  Definitely not one of my favorite CDs.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The way this book starts out is interesting for sure. Then it just continues to get better and better. This book is about two people who meet and connect but they have know idea how to love or be loved in return. And through out the book you get to see how they learn to trust each other. It is a really sweet read. I really enjoyed it.
031236198X|2.0|We had to read this as part of a company training. Two things stood out: 1...create a sense of urgency to get the penguins stirred to action and 2...use of peer pressure to get independent thinking penguins to enter group mind.<br />Would you want to be related to in this manner as an employee?
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis is a fun read.  But if your are not interested in the financial shenanigans of Wall Street - this book is not for you. Also available at your local library now.
B0042FZWC0|5.0|Chris is so helping me change my life with his wonderful books, especially to be comfortable not in a &#34;job&#34;.
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|I have never been a zombie movie fan at all but I have been hooked on this show since day one . I have been sick and real busy and didn't think about the show at all until just a couple of days ago . Decided to watch the first episode this season and start catching up 8 episodes straight later and it is killing me now to have to wait until February. Don't  stop this series ever !!!!!!!!!
B000GWE44U|5.0|It's not just a movie. It's a film to be observed, analyzed, and enjoyed. You need to see this film, especially since there are so many satires in cartoons, tv shows, and other movies based on the Shining.
0061537969|3.0|This book is really sad. So for anyone who goes into this expecting a lightweight, pleasant read, please be warned. From the beginning of this book we pretty much know how it is going to end, which when the writing is truly great doesn't really bother me all that much. I was not impressed with the way the actions of the dog were described here. I found myself wondering if the author has much experience being around dogs. There were times when the writing in this book felt strained and other times when I thought extra stuff was added because the dog must have run out of philosophy to share. When the dog is the main character and he is at the helm and command of the story, I would have expected there to be more description of dog-like tendencies. For me, this book was like reading a book written by a man pretending to be a dog who thought he was a man...for me it just didn't work. Not to say that the book is entirely bad, because it had some really good points as well. This book will at times make you laugh and in some parts bring you a sense of nostalgia for previous four-legged friends in your life. I didn't hate it, I just didn't love it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|be prepared to spend money.!!!!! I spent so much the first day it is pethetic. lo lo lo lo lo
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest. I have gotten so many great recipes and fun craft ideas to do with my children. I dare say that Pinterest is one of the greatest sites on the internet. I am a pinteresting fool!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I had no idea of what Dubstep Violin music was until our daughter told us about this CD; I never knew that the violin could be so amazing and what Lindsey Stirling does is make magic and take you away with her beautiful talent!  I would recommend this to everyone!
B00136LVJO|5.0|My favorite Christmas Album out of my collection!  The holiday season does not start for me until I put this album on and decorate my house.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's not  a bad way to kill a little time.  I'm surprised how much time I spend playing.<br />Worth the download at the price&hellip; just don't waste cash on in game items.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so captivating it left me at the edge of my seat the entire time. SUZANNE COLLINS IS A GENIUS! She not only delivered action and trill in this book but she  also brought  out  the sympathetic side and emotion not  to mention romance in the characters, which is enough to fill every teenagers standards when it comes to a good book
B002ZG974M|5.0|Culture has a profound influence on the developmental trajectory of infants. Although somewhat obvious, it is highly educational to observe how setting and attitudes define the opportunities for growing children. The documentary \\"Babies\\" (2010) follows the first year of life of four infants across the spectrum of developmental options. Edited without commentary, it forces the viewer to come to their own conclusions regarding the effects that environmental influences exert on development. In the video two traditional cultures, and two industrialized cultures are represented. Conclusions can be draw from these observations as to the cultural effects on sense of well being, level of anxiety and stress, high level cognitive function, locomotor and stability reflex function, eye tracking and convergence and the general level of developmental skills expressed by these children.<br />My take away from the film is that traditional cultures enable infants to develop at their own rate, without an agenda. The Namibian child in particular demonstrates a high degree of primary reflex integration. Emotionally this can be perceived in this child's sense of well-being, joy and enjoyment of life. The industrialized society children appear more attuned to their high level executive functions, but unsettled in their bodies.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wanted to read the second book and found the story is continued with an exciting turn of events that kept me very interested.  Now I want to read the third book as well.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I chose to watch Eclipse because I've never seen it and heard so many good things about it. I loved this movie and its a wonderful movie. If your interested in the Twilight Saga you have to watch all the movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i was a little hesitant on ordering these- but so glad i did. it has a very good story line and cant wait for more
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This movie was so good I cried like a baby and I loved every second of it. Bella and Edward have the most wonderful relationship and I can't wait to see Part 2. You have to see it if you haven't already.
034580404X|4.0|I was underwhelmed... the books are too simple, I was hoping for so much more, to get more into it.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|A must have travel app! You can't go wrong with TripAdvisor! I would've given it 5 stars, but there are still a few bugs that need to be worked out.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It's whats expected from a MIB movie. Pretty good but not enough alien action. It was worth renting and watching once.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I went on a tear and watched 30+ classic Japanese movies in just two months.  So many were fabulous, along with Kurosawa's well-known hits, I would recommend Kuroneko and Woman in the Dunes especially.  But somehow, this particular film has stuck in my head most continuously.  Perhaps it was its fantastical beauty, perhaps the power of myth to stick in the unconscious, just as dreams themselves tend to do.<br /><br />Dreams is not like any other movie I have ever seen, and likely the same for you.  There is no plotline, just vignettes of storylines that appear and disappear without resolution, some tapping Japanese folklore, some addressing modern issues of war and environmental degradation.  In this film Kurosawa was most frank about his moral concerns for our planet, aspects that elevate it above the merely entertaining.<br /><br />Beautifully rendered, with allegorical social statements from one of the world's all-time greatest film makers.......who could ask for more?<br />Rent it or buy it, and see if you find it as unforgettable as I have.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I had purchased this as a Christmas present for my daughter, and it didn't make it that far. We had already seen it in the theater, and neither of us wanted to wait to watch it again. We love that not only educates us, as most Disney/Pixar movies do, but it also shows us something outside of the stereotype Princess meets the Prince and falls in love.<br /><br />Very impressed. Hope they make more movies like this for our children in the future.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I saw this picture many times on cable, I always wanted to have it because I really like this play
B0015KO52S|5.0|A few months ago I was at the Disc Exchange in Knoxville, browsing, and after about 10 minutes this album came on over the shop stereo. Four songs in, I walked up to the front counter, asked what the album was, and bought it on the spot (straight out of their CD player). This album is a work of genius and not like anything I've come across before. And it gets better with every listen.<br /><br />Note: there is enough raw detail in this album that I would personally recommend skipping the mp3 version and going for vinyl or CD, especially if you have a good set of speakers or headphones. This album is not the same experience in MP3 format.
B0024CEY36|3.0|It was well written and interesting to hear about the war from the perspective of a Russian resistance fighter. But I found him basically a terrorist and really didn't find any one of the characters sympathetic, except perhaps for the wealthy lord who we were not supposed to like.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Thanks itunes for a &#34;free single of the week&#34;.  This Mercury Prize-winning group is really my sleeper band of the year.  I found out about them last month and I'm so happy I did.  The music is weird, it's quirky, but overall cerebral and really funky.  Perfect if you like Hot Chip or Battles....or a little in between.  &#34;Fitzpleasure&#34; is one of the best songs of 2012, hand's down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fast paced, exciting and thought provoking read!  Interesting from a parents point of view... Couldn't put the book down... Highly recommended!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|If you're into the Alien series and you like prequels, this is your movie. Very well done and ties into the first movie very well. Special effects are awesome and the HD picture and sound are stunning. The really great things is that the special effects don't overshadow the story. Enjoy!!
B00932ANQM|5.0|My wife thought the movie was very well made and accurately followed the book. I respect her critical evaluations, as she is well read and appreciates good books and movies. (I did not watch it!)
0375703764|5.0|one of the strangest books to ever read. this book is so abstract and interesting. would recommend to anyone. take your time reading.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This CD is just beautiful.  Please everyone purchase it. It is a pleasure to have this playing in our home this Xmas. We had visitors staying with us  and played in on our back deck and we all simply just loved it.
0307346617|4.0|this was a fun read. i really enjoyed this book. jumped around, but i didn't think it was confusing. fast read
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I am the biggest fan of Katy Perry and always thought that Ke$ha was second to her but after this album I think I like them both equally.  This is the first album to come out after Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream\\" that comes close to being as amazing.<br /><br />Ke$ha has really proven all her detractors wrong with this album, maybe when Tik Tok came out it was cool to make fun of her and dismiss but now it's a lot harder.<br /><br />I would say as a pure pop masterpiece this album is up there with Weezer's Blue Album.<br /><br />If you are a Ke$ha fan you have to get this and if you aren't you need to check her stuff out because you are really missing some great music.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Just like the comics I read as a kid. Hulk role was a little dissapointing but OK. All in all worth the rental
B004U52VPS|4.0|My son received this for his 5th birthday and he has not stopped playing it. He can play by himself just looking at the pictures and setting up the pigs. He also plays with his older brother and they have fun together with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it... on edge the entire time!!!  Finished in 3 days. Can't wait for the next book!!! So excited for mocking jay
B0063IH60K|5.0|I currently have it on my android phone and love it.  When I got my Kindle it was the first thing I downloaded!!
1846573793|5.0|This audio book and this series, kept my wife smiling for weeks and me too. She could listen to it on the way home from work in the car and not have to worry about the kids hearing it.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Bought this to use with an android tablet but will not connect.  Works well with a microsoft product laptop only.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a fascinating read. The two main characters are basically people we've all encountered at some point, but Flynn takes their personalities and stretches them to their most extreme manifestations. She uses love as a catalyst to draw out traits that might do better to remain hidden. The story can encourage the reader to reflect on their own relationship to love.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Could not be more pleased with the appearance and the function. I would recommend this app to everyone who need a calculator.  :-)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this show! Joss Whedon (the director) creates an awesome world of space cowboy bodaciousness! If you don't have it, buy it.
8408104926|5.0|Este libro le encanta a mi hijo, siempre lo tiene como referencia para darnos datos muy interesantes, en realidad es muy bueno
0062020889|2.0|Follett is a favorite of mine - but this didn't \\"grab\\" me like most of his other books.  There are some great characters in Triple, and an interesting premise - it just didn't come together (for me).
B0086213XW|1.0|who liked this movie?  bad characters.  unrealistic. and pretty stupid.  pretty much just offensive and one of the worst movies i have seen in the past few years.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The first book of the Reacher series - and the series starts out with a bang.  This is a really great book - as a stand alone or in the series.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|A worth while study of a different era when best intentions and secrecy could over time impact so stongly on others. The colloquial language adds a lot of local colour to the story telling which is set against a sobering background of the mistreatment of young orphans. The triumph of an unexpected connection to family makes a well plotted conclusion. Worth considering.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game higjghyuftft gyityufuygiyfuff s s s. b b b n j h g f y u I
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game I play it with all my brony friends lol I waited and waited and waited for this game!!!! so yeahh:)
B0097JYVAU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable read with terrific insights into the world of predictions. I highly recommend this to any one with an interest in predictions or who work with data. If predictions are the future then Nate silver is the field's first prophet.
0470876417|5.0|The book was in great condition and exactly what I was looking for; it was a great help.<br />Thank you for the book!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This was beyond bad. It was boring from the beginning,and the ending was predictable from the outset. The wisecracking became intolerable, the characters had no definition at all. This was a total waste of time and money.<br /><br />Will not consider another DeMille book for a long time.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This is a great start - you and your friends play a pictionary type game where you draw from your choice of three words.  The problem I have with this?  There is no end.  There is no points scoring system.  No one ever wins.  So it's a major time-suck, it doesn't really go anywhere,and the words eventually recycle so that you're drawing and guessing things you've seen before.  Many of the words are also pop-culture related, so it's difficult if you don't understand two of the three choices simply because you don't follow pop culture.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I didn't really like this kind of puzzle before this version came along.  It is challenging, but not impossible.  I do wish there was an &#34;Erase Errors&#34; option.  Some of the things I DO love?  The many different levels, the variation in the puzzles, and the fact that there are just so darn many puzzles!  It updates frequently, adding more puzzles on  a fairly regular basis.  I can't keep up!

B007HC3LHS|3.0|A fictional glimpse into the mind of someone suffering OCD and Post-traumatic stress disorder, this book was a quick read.  I was confused in the beginning when the book jumped back and forth between two different timelines - the character refers to herself by a nickname in the present, but her full name in the past.  The ending I found to be predictable and trite, but the story overall was a good read.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I have a DVD already and my family has been watching it during every Christmas.  Now we have a Blue-ray player so I bought one Blue-ray format this year to enjoy again.  This movie is the best among all those Christmas movies.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines is an amazing read - I couldn't stop turning the e-pages!  It reminded me a bit of an eerie version of &#34;The Truman Show,&#34; where the main character is thrust unknowing into a plot that everyone else is in on.  I won't give away the rather strange ending, which was the only disappointment. It tied up the loose ends, to a point, but it never resolved the question as to WHY Ethan was chosen.<br /><br />I gave it four stars.  It would have been five, except I was unsatisfied with the last few chapters where it took a turn towards B horror movie.
0307596885|4.0|This isn't the type of book I would normally be compelled to read.  If you're not familiar with Alice Munro's work (as I wasn't) the official blurb doesn't really give much of an idea as to what it's about.  There's a reason for that, the short stories contained within Dear Life are hard to describe in any significant way even after you've read them.<br /><br />The stories are steeped in melancholy and the quiet frustrations of ordinary existence.  Not necessarily sad stories so much as stories that aren't all tied up into easy resolutions or overly happy, contrived endings.  I was vaguely reminded of some of the writings of John Steinbeck, perhaps because, like Steinbeck, Ms. Munro seems to capture the essence of a certain kind of people as they existed in a certain place and time.<br /><br />Each story concentrates on relating a specific time or event in someone's life when their future is somehow changed, sometimes not great huge events but small choices that inform the direction that will, at some point down the line, eventually result in a change of destination... a wonder of what might have been. These are the kind of stories that stick with the reader long after they've been read.<br /><br />It's a very good book. It drew me in to the point that the characters became very much alive in my imagination and I found myself at times wanting to yell out to them. To offer some piece of advice or warning about what they were doing, to chastise them for poor decisions, or to comfort them in their moment of sorrow.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys literary fiction. There are adult themes and at least one instance of strong language.<br /><br />***I won this book in a free promotional giveaway contest.
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|I know I'm  a little late on the review of this video but I must say that I am pretty disappointed with the production of this movie. I realize that you do not watch a movie like this for Oscar-winning performances but I at least expected to laugh hysterically more than a few times for my money.<br /><br />I thought the parallels to current events could have been illustrated better.<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were just set a little too high? Either way I will not be watching this movie again.

B00633W614|4.0|I enjoyed entering further into the saga of the Cliftons and Barrington. Mr archer did not spend too much time reminding us what happened in the first book, for which I am grateful.  It was a good read, time enjoyably spent, and I look forward to the spring for the Lord chancellor's decision.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|This documentary follows the prenatal care, birth, and development of four babies from different parts of the world, from the 1st world comforts of San Francisco and Japan to the more earthy family life of rural areas of Africa and Mongolia. The differences are astonishing; the similarities are heartwarming. Nice soundtrack. As a bonus, babies love to watch it too.
1416955070|4.0|Clary Fray is a normal teenager: blind to her best friend's feelings for her (his name is Simon), having issues with her mom, and trying to find a place in this busy world.  Until one night, while at a club, she sees something that will change her life: a murder.  Or so she thinks.  But the oh-so-attractive Jace, the elusive Isabelle, and sulking Alec explain to her otherwise.  She lives in a world where most people are blind to the demons that lie around them, and the murder of a demon (who she thought was a person) opened her eyes to this world.  And so the story begins, with Clary going with Jace to a training facility after her mother disappears...<br />The story had such potential! Sadly, it was both cliche and predictable.  I predicted the outcome almost verbatim, and there were very few twists or unpredictable events.<br />Though it was a good read, and I will most likely read the other books in the series due to curiosity, this book is far from the 'classics' and upper-level fantasy writing.  It is, however, a fun, enticing read that you will not regret reading as, at least in my case, there is little NOT to like about the story (and we all need a little predictability at times...).
159420411X|1.0|I'm about a quarter of the way through the book, and I don't think I'll bother reading much more.<br /><br />The material about baseball and politics has been covered better elsewhere - Moneyball, obviously, for baseball (Silver's discussion adds nothing to this, for my money); and various other authors have picked over the rather tedious and obvious fox v. hedgehog political prediction stuff. (I think the Undercover Economist, maybe?). Anyway, fox/hedgehog is pretty old hat at this point, unless this is the first book of this type you've read. Both of these areas were discussed in a rather waffling manner, stating rather obvious 'mom and apple pie' type truths about how to make predictions.<br /><br />The point at which I have lost patience is when he starts talking bollocks about weather forecasting. Okay, it's outside of his area of expertise, but he should have got a competent adult to review his text. He states that because we're predicting based on volumes of atmosphere, rather than areas of the globe, the increase in computation required rises based on the cube of the number of cells per unit volume. Which is true, in general. But when he starts talking about cells that are 40x40x40 miles, rather than 80x80x80 miles, that's obviously just rubbish - the atmospheric modeling isn't divided vertically in this way. (40 miles is 211,000 feet - there's no atmosphere there...).<br /><br />Overall, my feeling was that the book was commissioned based on his election predictions of 2008 (sic), not because he had anything very revealing, or even interesting, to say.<br /><br />Maybe the book gets better; I believe from reviews that perhaps he starts making more substantial points later in the book (perhaps talking about Bayesian mechanisms for updating our knowledge?) but having given him a decent chance to engage my interest, I'm afraid I can't be bothered finding out. There are other, better, books I can spend my time on.

B004SEUIW4|3.0|This move is just o.k. and it's not \\"Truly Hilarious!\\" to anyone but Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post like it says on the DVD cover. The only reason I got it was because I thought Bill Hader at an amusement park would be funny. If it didn't have Bill Hader's name on the cover, I wouldn't have bought it.<br /><br />This is a semi-love triangle that includes Zombieland Boy, Twilight Girl and Green Lantern. The \\"teen angst\\" between Zombieland Boy and Twilight Girl is way overdone in this one. It might be charming the first 15-times Zombieland Boy stutters quietly and Twilight Girl looks like she's about to slit both wrist but you've got about 107-minutes of that here. For some reason you never tire of Green Lantern's cool, don't give a doo doo, sly mannerisms and wise man advice though. SNL's Kristen Wiig is restrained enough in this one with such little dialog that she's actually funny in her very limited role.<br /><br />The 80s music is really great and you are not going to get some of the movie if you aren't from the 80s anyway. All the 80s touches, the hair, the music and the cars are all vintage.<br /><br />This is an interesting movie to watch one time but it's not fall down funny. It's a decent chick flick with enough comedic elements in it for a dude to stay awake during the entire movie.
0399160450|5.0|Like others I had lost interest in the various co-cuthored books.  The \\"Ops Center\\"  series was especially bad and had me wondering if Clancy had done more than put his name on the cover.<br /><br />\\"Dead or Alive\\" was my first toe back in the water and while I thought it wasn't up to his older books, it was still a good read.<br />So I downloaded the two free preview chapters of Threat Vector to see if it was in the good camp, the great camp or the not-worth-the-money group.<br />The preview chapters were quite good so I bit.  I recommend that you download and read them before committing to buy.<br /><br />So... I finished the book about 36 hours ago and I've had some time to think about it.  You can see by the 5 stars that I liked it... it is the equal of his sole author works, which may be due to the fact that his co-author has some 40 books under his belt.  You can't see the parts that were written by him as was so painfully obvious in most of the other co-authored books.<br /><br />My favorite Clancy book is \\"Red Storm Rising\\".... and it's still my favorite.  But \\"Threat Vector\\" is in the top third.  It's vintage Clancy in that there's a mix of grand strategy and technical detail and his trademark collection of problems that slowly coalesce around the Ryan tribe, while coming to a boil.  Big picture to highly personal/individual, then back again.<br />What drives good Clancy novels is an uncanny timeliness and a thread of credibility... you are always thinking: \\"yeah, this could happen\\" and that is central to \\"Threat Vector\\".  The description of a robust cyberwar and the interaction between the virtual war and the shooting war is compelling..... and enlightening.<br /><br />As usual there are parts where Ryan (Jr, in this example) seems like Clark Kent but most of the story is very credible.  And all our old favorites are there and their life-stories are advanced, even if some of them are largely cameo appearances.<br /><br />My ultimate judgement comes down tothis:  I'm looking forward to the next Clancy novel.... again.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|I hate to be the guy who tells the end of the story. But here we go. First let me say it was a good movie & I'll watch it again someday... As I said &#34;Alien&#34;. In the end we see the creature from the movie &#34;Alien&#34; with Sigourney Weaver... On the other hand, we see the main character in this movie gets her hands on an alien ship & takes it to see if she can find it's origin.... I'm left with these questions.. Are we going to see a remake of the movie &#34;Alien&#34;? Or,,, as this movie seems to lead up to the previous mentioned,(Alien).. Or maybe a paradox where this character finds the source of the alien about the time Segourney finds the alien??..  You decide.
1451613512|5.0|The authors of this book, Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick, tell us that: \\"The United States' run as a global hegemon - the most powerful and dominant nation the world has ever seen - has been marked by proud achievements and terrible disappointments. It is the latter - the darker side of U. S. history - that we explore in the following pages.\\" That there is a considerable dark side can be attested by the fact that this book is 750 pages long. I don't know how many historical incidents are encompassed within its covers but there are 91 pages of notes and 37 pages of index just to give you a clue. In the index itself entries dealing with nuclear arms race, nuclear warfare and nuclear weapons take up almost an entire page of small print - by far the largest number of entries in any one category. In second place are entries dealing with the CIA which take up a half a page.<br /><br />Fourteen chapters plus an introduction give us an alternative history of the growth of the American Empire as Stone and Kuznick see it. It's not a pretty picture (although there are many bright spots) and, while it may be untold, for the most part, it is not unknown.<br /><br />Although Donald Rumsfeld has stated: \\"We don't seek empires. We're not imperialistic. We never have been,\\" dissenting voices have proclaimed otherwise. One of the earliest of these was General Smedley Butler, who at the end of his long and highly decorated carreer, said: \\"I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country\\"s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for big business, for Wall Street and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.\\"<br /><br />One of the most conflicted of our Imperialistic presidents was Woodrow Wilson. He hoped to spread democracy, end colonialism, and transform the world. His record is much less positive. \\"While supporting self-determination and opposing formal empire, he intervened repeatedly in other nations\\" internal affairs including Russia, Mexico and throughout Central America.  .  .  .  While championing social justice, he believed that property rights were sacrosanct and must never be infringed upon, Though endorseing human brotherhood, he believed that non-whites were inferior  and resegregated the federal government. While extolling democracy and the rule of law, he oversaw egregious abuses of civil liberties. While condemning imperialism, he sanctioned the use of the global imperial order. And, while proclaiming a just, non-punitive peace, he acquiesced in a harsh, retributive peace and inadvertently helped create the preconditions for the rise of Hitler and the Nazis.\\"<br /><br />While this book is about the dark side of American history,  it is not without its heroes. Here is one of FDR's most famous speeches: \\"We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace - business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that government by orghanized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob  .  .  . They are unanimous in their hate for me --- and I welcome their hatred.\\"<br /><br />On the role of the Soviet Union in World War II: \\"Until the invasion of Normandy , the Red army was regularly engaging  more than two hundred enemy divisions while the Americans and British together rarely confronted more than ten. Churchill admitted that it was the Russian army that tore the guts out of the German military machine. Germany lost over 6 million men on the eastern front and, approximately, 1 million on the western front and in the Mediterranean.\\"<br /><br />I was in high school when feisty little Harry Truman gave the Republicans their comeuppance in 1948 just as Barrack Obama did 64 years later. On both occasions the Republicans were \\"surprised.\\" I've read David McCullough\\"s biography so you might say that I've been farorably disposed toward Truman over the years. I thought that his bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a military necessity. In this book there is overwhelming evidence that it was not. Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur strongly opposed its use as did Admiral Leahy and General Telford Taylor (the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes trials who stated the the \\"rights and wrongs of Hiroshma may be debateable but I have never heard of plausible justification for Nagasaki.\\") One hundred and fifty-five scientists at Chicago's met lab and uranium plant at Oakridge opposed it and the Vatican condemned the bombing. General \\"Hap\\" Arnold of the Air Force opposed it as did Admrals King and Nimitz and others too mumerous to mention. If the Japanese  had used the atomic bomb on American civilians it would have been a \\"war crime.\\" I fail to see that our using it on them should lead to any differect conclusion.<br /><br />There is no question that the unsung hero of this book is Henry A. Wallace. According to the authors he had incurred the wrath of party conservatives by calling for a worldwide \\"people's revolution,\\" toward which end the United States and the Soviet Union would work together\\" and by championing the cause of labor unions, women, African Americans, and the victims of European colonialism. His enemies included Wall Street bankers and other anti-union business interests, southern segregationists, and defenders of British and French colonialism. Henry Wallace has been  largely lost to istory. Few people remember how close he came to getting the vice-presidential nomination on that steamy Chcago night in  July 1944. What might this country have become had Wallace succeeded Roosevelt in April 1945 instead of Truman. Would atomic bombs still have been used in World War II? Could we have avoided the nuclear arma race and the Cold War? Would civil rights and women's rights have triumphed in the immediate postwar years? Might colonialism have ended decades earlier and the fruits of science and technology been spread more equitably around the globe? We'll never know.<br /><br />During his time in office Dwight Eisenhower would be confronted with repeated opportunities to roll back the Cold War and arms race and he could have taken bold action that could have put the world on a different path. But because of ideology, political calculations, the exigencies of a militarized state, and limited imagination, he repeatedly failed to seize the opportunities that emerged.  However, in his Farewell Address to the nation he gave one of the  most memorable presidential speeches of all time warning of the dangers of a \\"military-industrial complex.\\"<br /><br />John F. Kennedy \\"had many enemies who deplored progressive change just as fervently as did those who had blocked Henry Wallace in 1944 when he was trying to lead the United States and the world down a similar path of peace and prosperity. Kennedy bravely defied the powerful forces who would have pushed the United State into a war with the Soviet Union. His courage was more than matched by Krushchev's. Future generations owe an enormous debt, and possibly their very existence, to the fact that those two men stared into the abyss and recoiled from what they saw. In his inaugural address Kennedy said that a torch had passed to a new generation but, with his death, it was passed back to Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Reagan who would systematically destroy the promise of the Kennedy years as they returned the country to war and repression.\\"<br />It's hard to believe that a man as coarse, crude and vulgar as Lyndon Johnson could have been elevated to the presidency (his language frequently came right out of the toilet and the f-word was omnipresent.) When it came down to it Johnson made his fateful choice: he would rather lose the Great Society than be defeated in an illegal and immoral war in southeast Asia. The war, which the U.S. would lose ignominiously despite Johnson's best efforts, would also spell the end of the last significant period of social and political reform the United States has seen.<br /><br />My favorite chapter title in the whole book: Chapter 9 \\"Nixon and Kissinger: The Madman and the Psychopath.\\" That certainly sums it all up. Read this chapter and you will learn all you want to know about \\"the odd couple.\\"<br /><br />Jimmy Carter, \\"who has performed in exemplary fashion out of office, was inept in office disappointing his supporters, betraying his convictions, and leaving office with an approval rating of 34 percent.  .  .  . His most enduring legacy was in opening the door to the dark side, legitimizing the often brutal policies of his successor, Ronald Reagan - policies that re-kindled the cold war and left a trail of innocent victims stretching from Afghanistan to the World Trade Center.\\"<br /><br />According to the authors Ronald Reagan was \\"one of the most poorly informed and least engaged chief executive's in U. S. history. He empowered a right-wing resurgence of hard-line anti-communists who militarized U.S. foreign policy and rekindled the cold war. He paid lip service to democracy while arming and supporting repressive dictators. He turned local and regional conflicts in the Middle East and Latin America into cold war battlegrounds, unleashing a reign of terror to suppress popular movements. He spent enormous sums on the military while cutting social programs for the poor. He sharply reduced taxes on the wealthy, tripling the national debt and transforming the United States from the world's leading creditor in 1981 to the world's biggest debtor by 1985. In October 1987 he oversaw the greatest stock market collapse since the Great Depression. He let the chance to rid the world of offensive nuclear weapons slip through his fingers because he wouldn't let go of a childish fantasy. And as for his much-vaunted role in ending the cold war, as we will see, the lion's share of credit goes instead to his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev.\\"<br /><br />Warning signs abounded in the summer of 2001 that something \\"spectacular\\" was about to happen. According to the writer Thomas Powers, in the nine months before September 11 intelligence personnel had warned the administration as many as forty times of the threat posed by Osama Bin Laden, but that is not what the administraitlon wanted to hear and they did not hear it. The Bush-Cheney administration then used this \\"surprise\\" criminal assault on the United States as an excuse to launch wars against two Islamic nations (one of them totally unjustified) - wars that would cause more damage to the United States than Osama Bin Laden ever could and to begin shredding the U.S.Constitution and the Geneva Convention.<br />George W. Bush was legendary for his misstatements and malapropisms. But sometimes, through the mangled syntax, a bit of truth would slip out. Such was the occasion in 2004 when he declared, \\"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country or our people, and neither do we.\\"<br /><br />\\"Obama, Managing a Wounded Empire\\" is the longest chapter in the book (is this because it has the most dark sides?) There is no doubt in my mind that, as between the two major parties in America today, the Democratic Party is the lesser of the evils by several orders of magnitude. Fortunately, I live in a very \\"blue\\" state and was able to vote for a third party candidate (Dr. Jill Stein) wihout affecting the outcome in any way. Here are some of the reasons why I could not vote for Obama: President Obama has asserted and exercised the right and power to secretly place human beings, including U. S. citizens on \\"kill lists\\" and then ordered the CIA to extinguish their lives - all without due process of law; he refuses to prosecute war criminals(Bush, Chaney, et al) despite overwhelming evidence of their wrongdoing; he has declared war on whistle-blowers whose only wrongdoing has been to expose war criminals; he practices indefinite detention; he engages in warrantless surveillance of American citizens; he practices extraordinay rendition of individulas to other countries; he monitors citizens without court order; he engages in drone warfare resulting in the death of numerous innocent victims; and he contiues to engage in the torture (a war crime) of Bradley Manning.

0385536828|5.0|Following her time at Cambridge University and after a brief affair with an older tutor, Serena Frome is groomed for the intelligence services, however, Britain in 1972 remains a closed bastion of male supremacy, and women in MI5 are still treated as little more than glorified secretaries. When Serena is recruited to the aptly named Sweet Tooth mission, the story takes on an altogether more complicated rhythm and as the seeds of deceit and disillusionment are sown, the intelligence of the narrative starts to emerge.<br />Overall, the story is well thought out, the characters are believable, and although at times I was irritated by Serena, I think she was representative of educated women of the time, who frustrated by the lack of advancement, endeavoured to discover the world for themselves, without really knowing what they were striving to achieve.  The rather lost and forlorn feel of England in the 1970's, with the decline of the Cold War and Britain's struggle under an avalanche of unrest, is eerily accurate.<br />There have been times when I have been profoundly disappointed by McEwan's novels, but I'm relieved note that with Sweet Tooth he is back on track. I read the book quickly, which is a first for me, as I sometimes find McEwan's books a little over complicated to read with ease, but Sweet Tooth engaged my interest from the start and soon became a real page turner.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I LOVED this movie. It wasn't corny at all, you were on the edge of your seat for much of the film and I dare you to predict the ending accurately........It leaves you guessing right to the end. This was a great storyline and was acted extremely well. At no time in the film did I find myself 'not believing' in the character, the storyline or the special effects. It is a must see movie, honestly the story line is so believable. 10 out of 10 from me.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The characters in this latest McEwan - which I awaited eagerly -aren't gripping, nor is the plot. I  positively loved Saturday, but I may never finish this one. Hope the characters get some spine.  One feels like shaking them!<br /><br />Now that I've finished it, I must say that the beginning is much stronger than the rest of the book.  McEwan's style changes to strangely flat partway through, when he's writing summaries of the writer-character's stories, and worst of all, the ending section of the novel is written in the same flat, dead style and reproduces one of writer-character's own story-endings, which is deeply disappointing.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Did anyone else notice the Panda in the game Icon looks like it has Terminators eyes :3???? hahaha it was funny that I noticed that :3
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game was fun and challenging at the same time. My husband, children, and I all play. Would recommend it if you like zombie games.
B00884GR0W|3.0|Minecraft is better because the controles are bigger &amp; easier to use. Don't get me wrong- it's a good game but the controles are the absolute WORST
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is Josh Groban's best CD.  I purchased these for a group of elderly woman who had never heard of him.  They all just thought this was great.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I came into this show with a Walking Dead marathon to get caught up, and overall I think that the third season feels like a different show.  The action is through the roof, and there were definitely nail-biting scenes and cliffhangers throughout the first half.  I think that character development has slowed down, mostly because we know these people and their motivations at this point.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|No rear camera.  you can only take a picture of yourself.  Do not have much use for farward facing camera when you cannot view what you are taking a picture of from behind the kindle fire hd.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I'm glad I got this DVD on sale and did not pay full price; it is really bad; what my wife and I especially hated was that most of the action took place in the dark or at night and you as the viewer cannot see anything; this happened most of the film.  What a rip-off; I wish I could get all my money back.
0812550706|5.0|My husband loved the series. Was glad to find it at a reasonable price. Just what we wanted to purchase.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|As the owner of more than 100 Christmas albums,yes it is a CD or an MP-3 ,but the format is still an album.I realize than the artists usually cover the same Songs ,but I love and always will love the way that each artist puts his personal stamp on each song ,that's why we buy them.On this album Rod does a great job with a great bunch of musicians in the swing and jazz orientated style of his Great American Songbook outings.This one is a keeper and I was really happy to add it to my collection.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I can only rate this product with max stars. The dialouge is amazingly well written, the cast is superb and I enjoy every minute of the series. I recommend this DVD to everyone.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|What a really good book.John Corey our hero in this book is quite the Sexist ,Male Chauvinistic cop,but that's how life is sometimes so it's really very realistic.Elizabeth Penrose is our heroine,she being the almost perfect dream girl who is main love interest of John Corey.She also is a detective who is in charge of this double murder case, so everything revolves around her including John Corey.There are many many sexual inuendos tossed her way from John ,so if your uncomfortable with that scenario don't buy the book.Let's just say in the beginning of the book John describes meeting Elizabeth for the first time and says we shook hands, she then removed her blazer to reveal a 38 revolver holstered under her right arm and two very well holstered 36 D's in front.That type of remark throughout the book.But the story line is very intriguing twisting and turning on a dime ,a really good mystery that takes place on Plum Island which as we all know really does exist almost reaching Area 51 status at times.Let's just say I will be purchasing more Nelson DeMille novels the writing is really great as well as the story.
B005LAIHHC|4.0|Funny movie, which at times can be pretty lame, but for Sasha and the viewer this simply works in a good harmony. Good laugh and money well spent for this movie.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Fun for the whole family with a great moral lesson for parent to teach their children.  Good animation and the story line moves along at a good clip.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I watched season 1 with enjoyment and was equally looking forward to this season 2. I haven't been disappointed at all, and here in Season 2 we see more action, more zombie attachs, more nail biting close encounters and best of all an amazing story line combined with a very good character cast.<br /><br />I recommend this to all fan loving zombie hunters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a Bible app that is  easy to use. I like that you can pick reading plans by topic, books of the bible, or just a whole Bible reading plan.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The read was easy, very entertaining. I work with wild animals so it was very fact based, however alittle gory on the details about the dying animals and at the end the two sides of the story, was it fantasy or fascinating. I found it to be both.  A great read for anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations! I wish there was one more!! The plot takes some unexpected twists and turns. You won't be able to put it down.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Game got old after 5 minutes of play. Not recomended for those with ADD or angry birds fans...least any hardcore ones.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was a beautiful inspirational movie.. its diff from all the other princess stories this is something any daughter can relate to
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great!!!!!!!! It is really fun to do. It gets harder the longer you run; but so what!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET APP!!!!!!!!! :-) ......... :-) ...... :-)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As always, David Baldacci grabs you at the beginning of the book.  I could not put this book down.  I enjoy all his books.
B000000OF6|5.0|With this greatest hits you don't need any more Queen CDs. There best songs and a great cd to have for a trip.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had a hard time with this book.  It just did not grab me at any point.  I struggled to get to the end.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I am a fan of the show.  Therefore, I like being able to go back from time to time and revisit these shows again.  I really do enjoy these.
B002VRZEYM|3.0|This film is all about Eric Schlosser and his experience with food.  \\"Who knows a farmer?\\" sums it up pretty well.  The first portion is spent on chickens, cattle and hogs.  I'll advise anyone that killing is a messy business, if you don't believe me, catch a fish, clean it, then submit that fish to a lab and see how you stack up against the meat packers, or try hunting.  No matter what, it's messy, so I don't get very worried about feed lots and slaughter houses.  With the amount of killing that's going on each day, it's a surprise to me there aren't more contaminations.  Oh yeah, Having Eric dress in farmers attire, struck me as disingenuous.<br /><br />I almost stopped watching when it began to rant about treating workers better and how industrialization animal husbandry was bad.<br /><br />The part about Monsanto, bugs me.  How much?  Will it change my diet? no.  Do I hate the concept of monopoly?  You bet.  Do I think it leaves our soybean and other crops precariously perched for a \\"shock?\\"  Absolutely.  This part by itself makes me think this is a worthwhile movie for everyone to see.<br /><br />Yeah, I know two farmers, but I don't live in LA nor New York, like Eric.  I'm in one of those fly over states.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Glad I bought it.Words cant explain this movie in 3D.Freaking amazing!I have a 63&#34; samsung 3d so i was glued to the tv.Imax didnt intrigue me as much.There is too much detail in Pandora to look at it on a big screen.Def recommend,price was awesome as well
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it... if you need great ideas in one place, like crafts to food ideas and gifts to diy thing this is the place to sheare ideas with your friends and the world...love it
B007EE564U|3.0|The story does not grip a person as some of the other books do which I buy on my KIndle
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's good but i can't mine redstone and I wish they put leavers,buttons,pressure plates,and downlodable content and the neather + the ather
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the best game it is funny and has lots of hard to get levels. I still love it
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft and the ability to make your own bases, caves, art, buildings, etc., but I can't help but feel like this Minecraft isn't complete. It needs more types of blocks, especially lava, water, and track blocks. I want to create a lava wall to seperate 2 bases, but the best I can do is put a huge wall of bedrock with ladders. The wall isn't exactly a tough obstacle, as you don't take damage or have to build something to go over it. They can just attack it and knock it down or climb the ladder. All I'm saying is, it needs more.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie almost weekly whenever there is nothing else on TV - the repeat of a great story is far superior to some of the trivial junk that is presently on TV.  I think that this may be a story about prison life that in many instances is sadly true.  The story itself is not without its very strong messages - our favorite &#34;its time to start living or time to start dying.&#34;  After serious illness, my husband has taken that line in the movie to heart and we both see the quality of our lives unfold in a somewhat controlled way by the Grace of God and a series of choices that we all are given the opportunity to make.  Not only is the movie an excellent story, but it is blessed with superior acting.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|We loved this series! Full of action and great actors. We had it recomended from a friend and he was right. Not for young kids! Loved to be able to watch at home through our PS3.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has done it again this was his best work , as all the Mitch Rapp series books are a great reed. I could not put this book down, the only disappointing part is the story ended to soon. Mitch Rapp is one ' Bad Ass &#34; agent that never stops until he has found his target and the bad guys are going to have the worst day of their lives.They tried to kill Mitch and almost pulled it off but as always the best trained Super Agent finds a way to escape the ambush by the Afgan terrorist hunting him. Vince Flynn we need more Mitch Rapp stories , so no rest please lets get back to work !!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|So excited that I was able find this DVD! Will be the perfect Christmas gift for my little girl! Awesome!
B00003CWRX|5.0|Good historic look at the fallout when one man exposes an injustice. Great story as told in 60 Minutes. Don Hewitt and mike Wallace with my first glance at Russell Crowe
0307895475|4.0|At 830 pages it's still incomplete, somewhat disorganized and not very user friendly but better than nothing when you have to get through such a difficult game.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Another great read by Archer.  I soon figured out that I had read the second book in the series first.  Too bad I must wait until May for the third book in this series.  Interesting way of writing; going back and forth with the characters.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It seems Warner Brothers likes to milk BD sets for every penny they can. Take this fine example - The new Batman Trilogy. It is billed with '2 discs of Special Features'. No, on a BD, a full disc could hold HOURS of material. There's no new features for Batman Begins. The Special Features for the Dark Knight are about 30 minutes total, though the Dark Knight Rises almost makes up for it with a fairly hefty delivery of extra stuff. I just expected more stuff.<br /><br />As far as the films? Why parrot what everyone else has already said? These BD are absolutely beautiful in HD and a powerful soundtrack (only 5.1 DTS, but still)It looks better than it did in IMAX. And that's why most folk bought this trilogy set. So while I have a few issues with it, I can't rate it lower, especially for the price that Amazon is currently offering.<br /><br />I have no doubt there will be a 'bigger' BD collection for these films somewhere down the road. But for now, I can manage with this set. And if you are on the fence about making the change to Blu-Ray in regards to these films, do it. Do it now. This collection is worth it.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|That's my main thing aside from the book reading like a fluffy version of The Dresden Files (as several people have already pointed out and I agree). I bought it because it was Urban Fantasy and set in Tempe. I lived the the Maple/Ash neighborhood for 16 years and was looking forward to reading this book. The 800 block of Ash is really great section of Tempe with Otto's Pizza, Ash Ave. Comics, El Pollo Supremo; Buffalo Exchange, et al; Wet Paint and Eastside are now gone but it is still a great place to hang out and Atticus' shop would have fit right in.<br /><br />However, Casey Moore's on 9th and Ash is where the Maple/Ash neighborhood goes for lunch and/or to drink a pint of Guinness and talk with friends both old and new, not Rula Bula. I've been to Rula Bula... the food was merely okay and... \\"Fish and chips?\\" From a 2100 year old Irishman? Really?<br /><br />The book? It too was merely okay and an quick read.
B003UBTX72|4.0|I guess Mick has a book out now too.  Still, I think this guy probably has a little better perspective on the history of the band.  It was a good read.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy to learn and still challenging. It's fun for several generations.<br />It can be quick or a great distraction for a long wait.
B004T4M5TM|3.0|All I can really say is that this book was OK.  Tina is very entertaining, but parts of the book sort of dragged.
1451695195|5.0|This is a quick and easy read.  If you are a truth-seeker like me, Dr. A's experience will help you on your journey.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|This guy is a true legend.  He lived his life close to the edge most of the time, but was smart enough to still be around to write a book about it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this book while aimed at younger readers is interesting and entertaining.  i will be buying the previous books. you can bet on that
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The girl who was a &#34;cutter&#34; upset me and the  family dynamics were too weird! I disliked the bratty sister and a mother who could treat her children that way was too difficult to read even though i finished the book.
B0000032LS|5.0|36 years since the film's release, and all the midnight madness that goes along.  I had my star turn in the early 80s and loved every second of it.  When my daughter was small, &#34;&#34;The Time Warp&#34;&#34; scared her to tears. That's not a happy memory, but it is indicative of this music's power over young and old.  Every song a winner, performed in character, editing is purrrfect, musicians are superb . . .if you don't like the movie, the soundtrack won't make much sense, but is definitely worth a listen.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I<br /><br />Christina Aguilera is an artist that is known for having an amazing voice but is often overlooked and undervalued as an artist .  She has put out an album that can be enjoyed from beginning to end,feels fresh,and has something for everyone my favorite thing about this CD is that each song is .ble and unique.  I have read reviews that wish she would pick one style but I enjoy her mix of genres and sounds because that along with stroller vocals and relatable lyrics make lotus stand out
B00A3YTC6Q|4.0|Great dance sequences, liked the original one better. But this is a fun movie for the entire family to watch
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Couldn't put it down......great suspense. Hope Lee Child's continues to write more. Can't wait to see the new Reacher movie.
0399536108|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. Chris is to the direct, honest and motivating. I did make radical changes after reading this book, and have never been happier! Love it and am re-reading it again!
B001S86J0I|5.0|Really funny movie with a steller cast.  Beautiful rendition of sets that brought the Star Trek series and interpersonal relations between actors.  Actors playing actors.  Scene Stealing Hack!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the second book in the series as much as the first.  It was a quick read and one I couldn't put down.  I needed to know what would happen to the characters.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|Three Brendan Frasier favorites of mine.  Mummies are pretty much the same from Egypt to Imperial China.  I loved the CG in all three.  Favorite saying in disc 3:  \\"You only killed one Mummy!  I killed the same Mummy twice\\"  lol
B0094BB4TW|1.0|One second the FB app was pretty good the next second it just sucked. I hate the new Kindle FB interface. I either use my android phone or my ITouch to read my FB page. I don't like the look of the page, I don't like lack of ease to use it. It is really lame. Why did you change something that worked to something that does not. It is ain't broke why try to fix it. I would have to vote your FB app as the worst app I have ever used. The worst part of this was the change was a total surprise to me. Literally within one second the app was \\"upgraded\\" to the newest interface. Bottom line I hate the new interface and want the old one back. It you cannot remember what it looks like check it out on an IPad or on an adroid phone.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Originally filmed on giant sets this cult classic is again from when I was a kid watching it in B&W.  The invisible Boy was another cult film that was  included.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|We saw this series on IFC and my husband was hooked. It scares me too much. Very realistic look at what could happen in a zombie outbreak . Acting is good, bloody so not or the faint hearted.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|I admit I bought Animal, Ke$ha's first album, without really knowing what I was getting into. Overbearing in its trashiness and actually musically bland with its content, I did not like most of the songs on it (in fact only one single and two other non-singles), but it was on sale! Did not buy Cannibal as was not impressed with what I heard when previewing it (though I did like and buy We R Who We R.)  So I was really skeptical when I heard this album was coming out, but I had a feeling I was going to like it once I heard Die Young and felt it was the best song she'd put out yet.<br /><br />When I previewed Warrior those feelings proved correct, and I instantly bought it. There are still some songs that are bland, and rest assured that Ke$ha keeps her self imposed trashy image, but she has delivered an overall sonically enjoyable record this time around. Her lyrics have actually shown some maturity at times too (ironic considering she touts herself as being first and foremost a songwriter, and previously keeping the lighter-party girl lyrics for her own songs.) It's not all dance too, there's a few slower songs and even a country-ish song. But it's still basically a pop album, just a very well crafted pop album. And for that I have to give her credit for where it's due. No it may not be the best album of 2012 but it's one of the most if not THE most improved second full over a first album that I've heard an artist deliver in quite some time. (yeah others have had better second albums than first in the past but not to this extent, this is like taking a Firehouse or Trixter album and putting it up against an Aerosmith set. Or in pop terms Christina Aguilera's Lotus up against, well, any of her other releases.<br /><br />Key tracks are Die Young(pure dance pop), Thinking Of You (incorporates some rock  into the sound) , Out Alive (Bonus Track) (sounds a little latin tinged with some dub step), Supernatural (is that funk I hear?), Warrior (another pure pop epic) and Wherever You Are (a soft trance/dance ballad-ish number).
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|Awesome. Better without commercial .so glad the series is continuing and a great way to spend time while waiting for the next season.
1566194431|4.0|Three different families with different values due to their place in early twentieth century life are depicted in this novel.  The Schlegels are wealthy, cultured and devoted to the arts while the more pragmatic Wilcoxes lead a life devoted to making money and improving their lifestyle.  The Basts represent the poorest segment of society striving to keep jobs and live above the debt they accumulate.<br /><br />It's a time of change for all of them.  The flighty Helen Schlegel believes she is in love with a young Schlegel she met only briefly but quickly realizes her mistake.  Her sister, Margaret, is more practical and analyzes human interactions carefully. The sisters adore each other and are very close but association with the Wilcoxes changes their relationship.  Henry proposes to Margaret who accepts.  Helen dislikes Henry and vanishes.  As this tale unfolds one becomes involved how societal change affects people on different levels with different views of life.
B0086700CM|5.0|the best most addicting exciting game ever!one time I was up until 10 o'clock! I love this game and you will to! get this app!;)plus it is free!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me guessing up to the end.  It is a variation on a common theme, love, betrayal and forgiveness, turned inside out.  It was a fast and fun read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun and nice that any age can play, but irritating that it freezes often. Hope that gets fixed soon. My 5 year old loves this. Also need more puzzles.
B005Q46HCK|3.0|Actress/singer/musician Zooey Deschanel  and producer/keyboard M. (for Matt)Ward have the pop-folksy-light jazz sound I'll put somewhere in between The Captain and Tenille and Harper's Bizarre.  The best song is probably the overdone-lately 'Baby It's cold Outside, which they take the tempo up a little to keep it fresh. 'Little Saint Nick' is a nice tribute to Brian Wilson, but by the time they get there, the lack of arrangement or variety have made the whole set feel rather bland. Also absent is any original composition,which drags down an otherwise well-produced album in my view.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It looked like it might be fun so I tried it.  starts slow at first but it grabs your attention soon.  it is not only exciting but relaxing too.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Thank you to all who made this movie possible; it embodies the purpose of film-making and the story of life, love, and humanity. I was so deeply touched by the project - a true MASTERPIECE. BRAVO a million times over. Don't just rent and see this film, but purchase a copy to keep for yourself. See it during times when you need to renew your hope in yourself and in humanity, and share it with others who need to do the same.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|love the speed of the game and trying to keep ahead of the avalanche.also the penguine and abominable snowman which is fun to try and catch and ride
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gone Girls has a plot of slap-in-your-face twists and turns. Just when you are beginning to think that you understand the characters, the next section flips your presumptions head over heels. Gillian Flynn plays with the reader. Her wonderful understanding and exploration of male and female quirks, vulnerabilities, manipulations and 'gender-anger' underline the cleverness of the plot as well as her writing skill. One is left disliking all the characters equally - an interesting result which should be used more frequently. Who says protagonists should be likable?
B0001ZXM54|5.0|What a band!  Nice compilation.  I really don't think you'll be sorry buying this one.  A ton of music that gives and gives that raunchy, Texas grit goodness.
B001XVS232|4.0|I enjoyed the give and take between Ed Harris' and Vitto Mortensen's characters. They really cared for each other. The story showed the fine line that can exist between honor and cowardice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game but find that I spend way too much time at it. Thanks for creating this game.
145470246X|5.0|The photographs are beautifully done and the illustrations are easy to follow. I really appreciate that she adds dimensions for the finished size on all the projects, both in inches and centimeters. This is a wonderful thing to do, especially since it's often hard to grasp the size of a bracelet, pendant, etc. when there are no sizes posted. Really helps in the planning process in case adjustments have to be made.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This note app offers the option for a check list that can be constantly updated say for the grocery store. So easy to use and so convenient!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Really funny and interesting! Love all of the characters! The story and setting are brilliant and none of the dialogue is cheesy!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have this program on my laptop and like it.  I assume that it probably is not needed, but a little insurance won't hurt.
B008Q00OZM|5.0|This movie is filled with humor at multiple levels. I really liked it. it was funny. I laughed and laughed.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|First, the bad. The lyrics are not as clever as previous offerings, and some of the songs are over-the-top repetitive.<br /><br />However, the sound of Owl City is still there, and it fits in really well to my Owl City playlists. As long as you don't listen to the whole album all at once, with each song in succession, the songs are actually pretty enjoyable.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Again Reacher's silent, waiting character absorbs the necessary details that escape notice of the other people in the story.  His physical strength is just one of his talents that he uses to right the terrible wrongs that he slides into and out of- leaving behind people and communities somehow better than before he came onto the scene.  Starts in a familiar place- Jack hitching a ride. He understands beyond the common man what the terrified passenger is trying to tell him something and he knows that the other men in the car are not what they seem... The addition of various Federal officials does not bother Jack- he knows how to recognize, assess and handle any 'agent' from the government.  If you know the series, you know what I mean when I saw that Cruise plays XXL, big, homely/handsome \\"Jack Reacher\\" - Really? Really? *sigh*
0525953728|5.0|Very well written account of the Bin Laden take down by someone that was there.  Well written. My copy has been read by 4 or 5 others whom also loved it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The cover and the contents of this bare bones set is top notch.  I was going to see the third film at the movies until the events that unfolded in the news.  For the seventeen dollars and change you get all three movies.  The last one, dispite what critics have said, is just as good as the previous films. I ususally like the director's commentary and extras with these sets.  There are few extras but the content of these movies more than makes up for it.  All three movies are very intense and will last with repeated viewings.  I don't have a Blue Ray and really can't afford the cost of upgrading to a new player.  However the picture quality is fine and good enough for my current TV set.  I'm thinking future editions will have some type of commentary.  However there isn't any from the director in this set. The movies are so good that I'm not concerned with that paticular \\"extra\\" that could have been added.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Please fix this feature, I can't tag within the app, on the mobile site, or even on the full website from my kindle fire HD or my android razr. Please fix this feature quickly, it is very annoying.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|There is lots of action and special effects, but the plot is somewhat convoluted. However, it is worthwhile movie to watch and enjoy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This has too many things that need fixing to list. The Facebook app on my Droid Razr Maxx works. This one doesn't.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love making those angry birds do my bidding. Nice feeling of getting the job done on the levels. Good for teaching problem solving and how to get jobs done with only what is available.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|A lot of people suggested the LifeProof case to me because it was waterproof.  When it arrived, it felt flimsy to me.  The front screen was warped and it made it very difficult to use my phone.  I returned it and went back to my dependable OtterBox.  I would only recommend someone try the LifeProof case IF they felt they had a real need for the waterproof feature.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Actually I thought this book was very repetitive and boring.  I also did not like the author portraying the girl as submissive and enjoying it.
0142501123|5.0|This is a very cute story, and the repetitive phrases really are engaging for little ones.  This was a requested story night after night, even when the child knew it by heart.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Less romance more action fighting and blood ; some predictability and some good plot twists. Simple read that starts a series better than Harry potter; faster paced and less sappy than twilight; more adventure than hunger games; and can't wait to see what comes next
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|A well established and well written series of serial killers and their pathology and misconstrued motives and the people who try to combat a vicous type of behavior.
075669812X|5.0|This comes with a very hard to find mini-figure.  My son (age 7) is wild about ninjago and especially the green ninja so this book on sale was a no brainer.  I have seen it several other places, even costco but non were less expensive than amazon's $10.00 price, well worth the money
B0092G1O8A|2.0|I loved the book and the story it told of a futuristic society.  I thought the characters were well developed and portrayed and that the dogmatic nature of apocoliptic societies was well construed.  The movies seemed flat and poorly constucted.  It seems hard to be a good actress when the script has been diluted and hollywooded.

B007KOMTUI|5.0|I don't watch too much TV, too many commercials.  I stumbled upon this show almost by accident on Netflix and got hooked, so I had to buy the last season (5) on Amazon.  Highly Recommended
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I like see this movie. It's amazing see old movie with new transfer digital and a lot of bonus in this edition. Specially if you buy cheap. Transfer video it's excellent with perfect audio. so why you so wait .. grap it and place order for this edition
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I prefer the E5.  This feels cheap, has to many iterations ( different colors and sounds), the clip is plastic so I removed it and will certainly never use it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|If you are looking for away to find today's or next weeks weather this app is for you. A great deal of useful information.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|but glu company need to make more ways to get coins other than crates it litily thinks about what pride
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I love this app and all the music and the videos but its really slow on my Kindle Fire) : If it would be faster you will get 5 stars but for now its a 3 or 4
B0063M22QO|4.0|I chose this game because it looked interesting and it is. I am enjoying it on my kindle.<br />it is something I can play atnight when I can't sleep and not wake my husband.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter for her birthday, she loves it. We have had no problems with it
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am very happy with this case for my Kindle Fire. It provides excellent protection for the device, and the stand works well on flat stable surfaces (stand not recommended for angled or unstable surfaces, but handheld it's one of the best).
B009FXIICK|3.0|Very standard match game. Looks and sounds good. Does not crash. Not much replay. Only two modes. Modes are very similar.
0345525558|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved!!! This is a book to sit with, and take your tea and warm blanket.... and kleenex! You will get immersed and ignore life for awhile as you read this- it's worth it!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the book and it is very eye opening the experiences he had. Touching but insightful. Would recommned it to anyone interested in God and the afterlife
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This game is addicting. The special moves of each star wars bird character is awesome. Wish there were more levels and that the &#34;free&#34; update worked.
B001UU75WK|2.0|The main character is an idiot, if you're a guy spare yourself. They tried to rip off the x-files but did an awful job.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I really enjoyed the fact that this movie followed the historical timeline of the Civil War and Abraham LIncoln's rise to presidency. The John-Woo-esque, almost-Matrix action scenes were fun. Plus...kung-fu with an axe? What's not to like?
B003THJA1G|5.0|This is a very clever and entertaining series.  The writing is great and the character of Richard Castle is funny and endearing.  Love it!
1435122968|5.0|As a massive HP Lovecraft geek, I've owned multiple collections that were said to be complete, but were always missing something. There are a few hundred minor errata, but, case and point, they are minor. A must have for any Cthulhu-junkie. :D
B000OCXI3K|5.0|Having seen the movie and really liking it, I thought I'd read the kindle book. Very glad I did. It varied greatly from the movie like so many books made into movies do. It was a magical movie based on a magical book, but the  book gives you a bigger window on humanity's good and bad characteristics where the movie gave more of a sugar coated version. I will keep this one on my device to read over and over.
1881273377|5.0|This book (and its audio CD) provides wonderful insights into how people show love and interpret love which is helpful for any type of relationship. So often we misunderstand other people simply because we experience love and appreciation differently. Coming to understand the differences in the languages of love that others speak we can become better at showing those we care about how much we love them and we can also become better at understanding when they are showing us their love.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I really enjoyed the concept of this movie - using drugs and genetic changes to improve human performance. Jeremy Renner, who I have folllowed over the years, watching his acting get better and better is very good, and Rachel Weicz (not sure if I spelled her last name correctly) is very good as well. Some parts of the story were disappointing-Pam Landee getting arrested, but no followup on what happens to her. Ed Norton , as always, is excellent. Some choppiness of story , mostly at the beginning, as they try to establish the movie's premise, but a fun film. Good setup for another movie as well.
B008COD5OO|5.0|I thought this movie was worth the rental price that I paid. It had it's funny moments and then it didn't but as far as original movies go I was pleasantly surprised.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I know very little about baseball, but I really enjoyed this movie once I got the hang of what was going on. The first 15-20 minutes were a struggle, but after that I thought the movie was interesting, realistic, and entertaining. The casting was brilliant. Everyone was really flawless. By the time the end rolled around, I care about all of them and was rooting for the As. Great show!
B005D6O1GK|2.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE croc brand anything but this design just did not fit my foot right. Hurt my toes and did not breathe (got gross sweaty feet) yuck!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|For a kids app, I was surprised when it instantly wanted her to buy more &#34;gems and such&#34;  with packages up to 49.99.  Even though I have parental controls on, I removed it from the Kindle.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|He is awesome, and although this is not typical, it moves from Popsy Rufus to Deep Rufus over the course of the album. Yeah Rufus!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Won't let me play - force closes every time I open a game. Love this game but the kindle fire version doesn't work
0060887966|5.0|I got this hardcover gift edition for only $11 and it is in brand new condition.  I got this book from a friend and before I even finished it, I went and bought this copy because that is how amazing it is.  I recommend it to everyone I can, it changed my life.  It will change how you view your life and your journey and destiny.  A MUST READ! Great purchase.
B0087HT36U|5.0|^&hellip;^ this Game is amazing,  it Allows me to waste time.  the only problem i already beat every level can't wait for a new map
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have not been so engaged in a book since I read Stephen King 's The Stand. Got through all three in 2 weeks
B0096CDG0O|4.0|I got the full version when it was the free game of the day. It is a pretty good Yahtzee clone.  The play is fast - at least as fast as your opponent plays. It has traditional rules so no big surprises there. I'm not impressed with in-app sales...but as long as enough people are spending money that way I don't see game designers changing. I also don't like that you can sell your friends contact info for extra turns too.<br /><br />A few comments about what other reviewers have had issues with:<br />☑ It is not a Farkle clone - that is very different dice game.<br />☑ You can turn off notifications in the settings.<br />☑ I don't see the permissions as any worse than other with friends type games<br />☑ Facebook loop - I got stuck in that too. Exited the game and restarted and it worked itself out. Still frustrating.<br /><br />All in all - well worth what I paid. Regular price? well...I'd prefer to see it at $0.99.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Like a British Jason Mraz, Ed Sheeran shows such diverse understanding of indie rock and current mainstream pop on his album `+', a beautiful collection of intelligent lyrics, catchy beats and overall impactful music.  The fact that Sheeran can sooth with his vocals and then entice with significant rhythm is impressive to say the least.  Jumping from the bouncy flow of `Grade 8' right into the smoky earnestness of `Wake Me Up' (a brilliant track that calls to mind the marvelous Kate Nash) is flawless.<br /><br />He's got this music thing down.<br /><br />I may not review a lot of music on here (I need to get back into that) but I do listen to a lot of it, and I have to say that `+' is certainly one of the best albums of 2012.  Not only that, it may be one of the best albums I own at this moment.  It is one of the most well rounded albums I've ever heard, containing so many layers of musicality and style that make it effortlessly entertaining and accessible.  I never want to stop listening to it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of his big hit `The A Team' then you'll really appreciate songs like `Lego House', `The City', `Grade 8' and `Drunk', songs that really play up the playful tones that Sheeran brings to his breed of `Songwriter Pop'.  `Grade 8' is one of my favorite tracks on the album, serving up an edgy spunk that permeates each facet of the track (right down to the soulful musicality that reminds me a bit of Craig David) and that chorus is not only catchy as all get out but fun to boot.  `Drunk' pulls from those same qualities with a more subdued essence.  The way he plays with lyrics is very much like Jason Mraz, before he tried so hard to become John Mayer.  I just fell in love with `Lego House' immediately, that chorus is just PERFECTION!  The swells are so emotionally intoxicating, and the way his voice reaches so many levels is just flawless.  `The City' isn't really my favorite here, but it has a fun factor to it and reminds me of Owl City, so it'll certainly have some fans.<br /><br />`U.N.I' and `You Need Me, I Don't Need You' give Ed a chance to try his hand at rap (sort of), and he pulls it off enough to not embarrass himself (but this isn't his forte).  `U.N.I.' is better than `You Need Me, I Don't Need You' (the one song where I kind of hate the chorus).  `U.N.I.' has some great lyrical content and a greatly balanced chorus that helps elevate the song and add a tenderness that makes it more impactful and relevant.<br /><br />`Wake Me Up', `This', `Kiss Me' and the closing track `Give Me Love' all fall into a beautiful wheelhouse of perfected Singer/Songwriter ballads.  As I mentioned, `Wake Me Up' reminds me a tad of Kate Nash, very talk/sing and wordy (storytelling).  `This' has breathy qualities that show vulnerability, while the pleading in `Kiss Me' and `Give Me Love' reach out with such earnestness and near aggressiveness that you can't help but be swayed by his every word.<br /><br />And then there is `Small Bump' which leaves me in a puddle of tears with every listen.  Singing about the death of a child is SO HARD TO PULL OFF.  The subject alone is so hard to talk about, let alone sing about.  The hardest thing about this song is that it doesn't feel like that kind of song until the very end.  Listening to the song, it is so touching and heartfelt and honestly, I was crying because of how sweet and sincere it was.  I was sitting there listening to lyrics like \\"if you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you\\" and \\"you are my one and only, and you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight\\" and \\"you're just a small bump I know, you'll grow into your skin\\", thinking about my kids and bawling like a baby and then the final words come (\\"you were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life...maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why\\") and I lost it.  Seriously, I'm tearing up just writing about it.<br /><br />UGH!<br /><br />So, in the end, this album is amazing and I can't recommend it enough.  I am so happy that Sheeran is getting play here in the States.  Here's to hoping that he only grows from here!ing and I can't recommend it enough.  I am so happy that Sheeran is getting play here in the States.  Here's to hoping that he only grows from here!
B000641MB6|5.0|This film came a day early. Still factory sealed. The movie itself was even better than I expected. Great quality, great price, I would recommend this seller to all.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I really like Agatha Christie. I've seen some of the movies that were made from her books, and they are just as good. The book has an easy flow to it and it hard to put down. The ending caught me totally off guard . I look forward to reading her other books.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Add me please fc1a3 .  I need some friends. on here but it will only let me put 4 characters not 5.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Definitely worth it! comfortable, durable and great sound.  Had them for over 1 year - I use them to work out.  they do not move and do the job - worth it.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Enjoyable, as I knew it would be. A good story with a lot of history. I learned a lot about WWI from this book.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I mostly use a calculator for simple tasks such as shopping. I find this very helpful with these tasks. I would recommend this app to others.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This one made me want Book Three. I did have some trouble keeping the families straight. At first it was trying to remember who was related to whom from Book One.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this App. I am addicted to looking at what my fbf say on fb and this on your kindle will let you know minute to minute what everyone of your bf will be saying and it works quite well. I would highly recommend it for the kindle.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I I give it five stars cuss its awesome it gives me a chance to edit pica and post them on facebook
B007HACDLK|5.0|story moves quickly, an easy read in a day. Bringing back previous story characters, makes you wonder what will come new, looking forward to next story
B00A8ECU24|2.0|My 3 year old loves this game but I have a problem with how they randomly ask her if she wants to spend $49.99 (or other sums of real cash) on my little pony tokens- and will charge you by clicking &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;. I think this is very tricky, especially since the demographic for this game are young children who wouldn't know better.<br /><br />If that was removed or updated, I would give this game a higher rating because it's fun for younger kids and easy for her to follow.
0316123587|5.0|A wonderful Yearbook ! Love it ! If you are a Gleek you should buy this now ! :) .
034580404X|5.0|My Aunt has start her three book already.  She loves the series and she said it was all the rave.
B0074AGVWK|4.0|I love Maeve Binchy's writing style; I'm now a fan. She could have a second job giving advice on a call up radio program. Easy to read and entertaining.
0307450570|5.0|I love decorating for partying and Baby showers.  If I want the special touch or kick I go to Marthas book and web site
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great, so now I have a new writer to follow. Took less time than expected to read through, and had to watch the clock to be sure I was not running late.
0307586901|5.0|The most quick go to when having a party.  If you have your theme or not Martha can finish a theme or help you create a theme.  A most have for your craft library
B0086700CM|4.0|I would give it five stars except that it sometimes hangs up and has to be restarted. Don't know if this is a Kindle issue or a game issue, though.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I do not hand out five star reviews lightly... but this book more than deserves it. Wonderful read. I recommend it for all ages.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|I love David Garrett's playing and I expected a good piece of work. I preordered without hearing any samples. I was simply blown away when I played it. His playing is technically very, very good, as expected. All of the selections but one are very good. I've played this CD many times already. I love the mix of classical and rock selections. I love his cross-over style. My one nit of this CD is the mix of the drums on a couple of selections. The drums are \\"out there\\" a tad too much. It doesn't effect the quality of the violin's sound but it causes too much thump that doesn't need to be there. Over all, regardless of the mixing of the drums, this is a solid five star recording. Garrett is a top player, his arranging is very good, and his violin has a wonderful sound.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|A Good movie made even better in 3D sound and video are great 3D realy makes everthing come to life recommend this to everyone kids and adults
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I am a big fan of Judi Dench, and the movie was just wonderful, and took you on this adventure thru India.
B005IZLPME|5.0|Great Movie just don't get tired of it love it in 3D has everything, happy,sad romantic and lots of action just about a good ole american hero
B009JBZH54|5.0|I already had Batman Begins on Blu Ray, but when comparing the price of The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises to this three movie set, it was cheaper to buy this trilogy than the other two movies individually.  I love a bargain and will now give my Blu Ray Batman Begins to a family member.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Was the same enjoyable I-Robot Will Smith is just a good actor. 3D for some reason wasn't as good as other 3D movies I've watched just seemed to have too many ghosts in it still worth watching though
B001DJLD1M|4.0|Got the entire set so I'd have the entire collection of Matrix films.  The first movie was the best, but the rest are worth a viewing at least once.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Bought this in 3D it was fantastic, was always a great sory but 3D just made it that much beeter can't wait for Avatar 2.
B001TCNSOI|4.0|Jolie miscast for this roll. Her makeup was worse. Preposterous, but true story is intriging to watch. Clint tells it well.
1439137692|2.0|Used this book for school, I personally didn't like it, but It was helpful for that class. Not my cup of tea.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A very good prequel to the Alien series. While it is hard to beat the original &#34;Alien&#34; this is certainly equal or better than the 3 &#34;Alien&#34; follow ups. The final scene with the sole survivor female lead blasting off in the alien space ship leaves an opening for follow ups on a different story tangent from the original series.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Definitely a cute movie, it explains all the reasons of why he is like he is. My neighbor's kids loved this!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My daughter is a big fan of Taylor Swift.  She loved receiving this cd and plays it all the time!!!!
037571457X|2.0|Used this book for school, I personally didn't like it, but It was helpful for that class. Not my cup of tea.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Very English humor, which has a very strong list of veteran English actors who show there versatility and keep you smiling
031606792X|5.0|The story line was one that pulled you in, and made you not able to put it down. I liked the whole series.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This is a true girls move and makes my wife and her girlfriends quiet for at least two hours, happy Wife happy Life
B001GCUNW6|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! A must buy! My daughter loves it and has watched it plenty of times since I purchased it.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|great for a rainey weekend, staying in bed with your wife, highly recomended for all who like the unexpected plots
B000QCS8TW|5.0|That's it....the series...A.Mazing!<br />It is a crazy, wonderful, fascinating series.  Addicting. I am so sorry that I finished reading the books...
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My kids would play this for hours if I would let them.  Well done game.  The developer has other great games too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|like the old gamed we used to play.  excellent time waster. loved the game.  not a fan of the coin limit though
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game keeps closing at random times. Each update produces a new bug. Poor customer service because everyone has complained and nothing has been fixed . Not worth it!
B003YOMNCM|5.0|Hilary Hahn has busted out a ton of recordings fast and I think she's proved her consistency. All her recordings are flawless and played the way the composer and violin teachers intended it. So, you people who can't play the violin at all rate her low and somehow something is not good enough. I have an idea. Why don't we record you and you  can show us what a 5 star performance sounds like. Think carefully before you make a fool of yourself at the expense of the performer. Please don't screw up her sales of these recordings. She depends on this to survive so she can continue to entertain you nit wits. Hilary Hahn you are one tough cookie who plays the heck out of the violin. You have made my life forever changed having the pleasure of hearing you all these years!
B009XY97VC|5.0|Granted the MP3s are not 320kbps, however they are far better then other lower quality standards I've come across. And unlike many other albums, the CD is available for me to rectify that my self for my own collection.<br /><br />Every nuance from the first hint of violins at the beginning of &#34;All is Hell That Ends Well&#34; threw the last hint of ambiance of &#34;Ocean Kingdom&#34;, is full of soul, passion, and truly Epic.
0307279189|5.0|The book tells story of tribe that transcends beyond Copper Canyons. Each one of us can see ourselves in the book. By being part of characters of book, it leaves inspiring action of exercise and running. Running has been one of prime skills that seems to have been lost in modern day technology. The book brings importance of it without making invasive conscious effort weaving story making reader part of the characters in the book.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book will have a lasting impact on me. At times it felt like it validated my very existence. I had so many ah ha moments. It will help me stop the feelings of guilt and shame that were always part of my life. It will be easier to be comfortable in my own skin and that will give me confidence and self assurance with much less angst. At 55, I had already found ways to cope and many coworkers when I talked about the book were surprised I am an introvert. For the first time when I talked about the things I do to help me deal with something it was ok when the other person was looking confused and asking questions that made it clear they thought all that was kind of weird. Why did I need to get in a quiet place when I started a new job or any new activity and spend time looking around the room and telling myself that in a few days, in a few weeks, in a year, this place will be my place and I will feel like I belong here.  Weird no more! I have an introvert daughter and an extrovert son and this book will help me be a better mother to both. I'm telling everyone to read this book.
034580404X|4.0|I gifted it to a friend and business associate.<br />Her question &#34;How did you knew I will love reading this book&#34;<br />After that she has loaned to read to some of her friends<br />So I guess the book is excellent read
1612183956|5.0|Thoroughly impressed by the author's writing skills to maintain the tension and convey the desperation at the right times.  Great story, too.  I was blown away by the thesis of the story and what a powerful ending.  Would make a great big screen movie, too (if the screen writers, directors and special effects guys don't screw it up).  Highly recommend this book.  Need to be patient in the beginning as the story develops but the pay-off is well worth it in the end and the details really matter!!!  Look forward to more novels by this author............
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Had to have this highly rated disc collection.  This is the ultimate Alien collection for all the Alien fans out here.
B000286S8S|5.0|first time i ever bought a van halen cd. i love it. i bought it because i love hearing interlude to pretty woman they play on radio. i was dissappointed this was not the version on this cd though.i'd absolutely recommend this cd
B000BNI99K|5.0|I was never a Rod Stewart fan until the Great American Songbook albums. I own all of them and wore them out. I now own the Great American Songbook Collection and enjoy listening to them often.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Free Flow is lots of fun and provides a real challenge.  It didn't take long before I had to put it down or I would have been up all night.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this case for my daughter's Iphone 4 and it didn't even last 4 months. It's already broken under normal everyday use. We will be going back to OtterBox!
0143122061|3.0|Another view:  It was primarily industrialization, which initially had little to do with Ferguson's six &#34;killer apps,&#34; that set the West (and Japan) materially above &#34; the Rest&#34; beginning in the 18th century.
B009C7JS14|4.0|I have folled the weather patterns for years. This gives me much of what I want at a glance.  Quick and easy.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I'm only halfway through the book and find it to be super hilarious so far.  I read the other reviews before purchasing, but still wasn't sure I'd love it as much as the previous readers did, and am happy to say that I'm loving it so far.  Caitlin Moran uses descriptive terms and wonderful analogies to entertain and inform.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Joey Belladonna is back with Anthrax and man they couldn't sound any better!  Worship Music is, in my opinion, the best album of their career and one of the best metal albums of the last twenty years.  Every song is a keeper and songs like The Devil You Know, I'm Alive, and In The End keep me coming back for more...oh yeah, not  to forget about their heavy ode to zombies, Fight 'Em Till You Can't.  BUY IT.
B009F879HK|5.0|TRYING TO OBTAIN EITHER ISSUE WAS A BIT OF A CHORE,<br />BUT 2ND ISSUE WAS THE ONE ! REPORTEDLY ONLY 6000 PRESSED !<br />AS I SAID, 50 YEARS AGO, WOW !!!<br />GO FOR IT YOU BEATLE FANS, GO FOR IT !!!

B0053O89KG|5.0|Love this series, one of the best I have viewed.  Fantastic characters, great story lines.  Look forward to each new season!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|It was much different than our expectations.  The trailer looked like it was going to have plenty of funny moments.  Unfortunately the only funny scenes were shown in the trailer.  Disregard any preconceptions of this being an uplifting movie.  Meryl Streep, as usual, was great though.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this series!  I don't view it on TV, would rather see it when I can, that's why I buy the DVD.  Have seasons 1 thru 5 and thoroughly enjoy them all.  The interactions of the characters is fantastic.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Thank you for adding this book for the kindle. It took a long time to get there and I hope you will continue to add best sellers as quickly as possible.
0060853972|1.0|What a self conscious mess.  This was a storyteller telling a story about a story--yeah, now demand your money back.  It's amazing to me how many writers don't hold themselves up to the standards of great storytellers but then prance around the media as if they are the world's best writers.  I thought writers were supposed to be the seekers of truth. Turn it onto yourselves.  This book should have never been published.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I love the show. Been watching since season one and it keeps getting better. Can't wait to watch some more of the show
B009GX6600|5.0|Season 10 is just as exciting as the rest of the series.  Season 9 ended with quite a cliff hanger, so season 10 was a welcome sight.  We love buying each episode at our own pace.  All in all this series continues to be an excellent show.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I can not find a single CD to capture the best of Dylan but this one comes close. I bought few more.
B00280LYHS|4.0|This was a very action packed book. I just love the way rick riordan put an end to the series. Percy is a beast and who does not love a guy who can form hurricanes and fight 200 enemies at once? I absolutely am lovin it.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|Never gets old. They moved the world with these songs. Decent sound and technics on this CD. I will considewr another Remastered.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|Just what you'd expect, cheesy cheesy, but what woman wouldn't want to watch these two dance for 90 minutes? Would not rec to any straight man.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Tony Bennett is timeless. This is not his best work but as good as it gets for a duets. Good.
B008V0OLOW|4.0|From the way this new album was advertised it sounded as if Diana were stepping out of character, so I ordered one out of curiosity. It's truely amazing what she did with ancient material and an ancient piano, and no, she's not the least bit out of character on this. She's a very talented and spirited musician, and I love the way she picks me up when I'm feeling down.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|She is the Best. It is difficult to capture the Ultimate in one CD. I will buy several more to create a collection.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book was a book club choice. I found it to be an interesting view into everyday life under difficult WWII circumstances by the narrator of the story which happens to be death.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I found this book a little slow to get into. I like the concept but I would not recommend it.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />I was granted an ARC for an honest review.<br /><br />The Duchess War is a very clever story and it is brilliantly written. Oh how I love a really smart heroine. Perhaps there is nothing I love more other than a hero who respects just how intelligent and noble the heroine really is.<br /><br />There is a prequel to The Duchess War called The Governess Affair. My review of this prequel is here. The Kindle version is only .99 and I would recommend reading it first. It is not necessary but it does nicely line up the foundation for the this Brothers Sinister series.<br /><br />The concealed secrets within The Duchess War are slowly revealed. The reader learns about the depth of these mysteries in parallel with the other book's characters. I found myself dying to know the extent of the shrouded mystery surrounding Minnie and the extent of Robert's upbringing. Together with these secrets and the series of events that emerge chapter after chapter; The Duchess War made for a rather suspenseful read. There was a perpetual chain of events that kept me clicking the pages forward quickly. It was very fitting that the game of chess was an embedded plot of The Duchess War.<br /><br />I found Minnie a rather complex character. Her mind was always plotting forward steps ahead. She was a very guarded lady prepared for her next ploy. The Duchess War made me ache for the women of the time as Minnie was striving hard to carefully carve out a safety net for her foreboding future. She took great effort not to bring attention to herself. Although her soft voice gave the perception of shyness, she was in fact a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The Duke, Robert wasn't a brooding alpha hero that normally appear within the pages of historical romances. He is a romantic at heart. A dreamer. A do-gooder if you will. And finally a Duke that isn't a rake with an abundance of sexual conquests. In the shadows of his dark Ducal father, he aspired to be the complete opposite of him. My heart ached for him. He was determined to make right so many wrongs.<br /><br />The \\"war\\" Minnie battles with the Duke is based upon proving he is the author and mastermind behind distributing seditious pamphlets that she is being suspected of organizing. After her attempt of blackmailing the Duke was not successful, Minnie sets forth to bring about the indisputable proof she needs to secure her innocence. What she doesn't count on is the Duke becoming enamored with her while trying to war against him.<br /><br />Amazing quotes from Minnie:<br />\\"You probably think battles are won with cannons and brave speeches and fearless charges. They're not. Wars are won by dint of having adequate shoe leather. They're won by boys who make shells in munitions factories, by supply trains shielded from enemy eyes. Wars are won by careful attendance to boring detail. If you wait to see the cavalry charge, Your Grace, you'll have already lost.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm sure your prick is as massive as your head is thick.\\"<br /><br />Teasers: Sedition, humorous train ride with friends, wedding night lessons, alphabet book primerto be the complete opposite of him.

B000000OS2|5.0|These guys sound great acoustic and the only song on here that sucks is the very last one which is more of a goofy jam than a real song.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|DeMille is a true storyteller.  If you like his work, you'll enjoy this book.  As usual, it is lengthy, as DeMille paints a detailed account of the storyline.  John Corey is a likable character.  An what a bargain at only 99¢ on my Kindle!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I highly recommend this series. This was different than anything I have read in years. I couldn't put the books down and at the same time hated that the story was over. Looks like there are some other related titles and I can't wait to read those as well.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Love the characters, language and wonderful photography of this version of Emma.  I've enjoyed seeing it many times.  Jane Austen a woman ahead of her time.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was highly recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. Great depiction of what a future world might look like while at the same time taking a ride back to the 80's. So many references that I had forgotten what it was like to have grown up during that time. Lots of smiles from the nuggets trivia and the twists within the story as well.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|good fun for when I have to wait around. Sometimes the birds look a little too small on my kindle fire HD but otherwise fine.
1439127700|5.0|This informative book revealed, not only the personalities of the presidents, but the reasoning for choices they made.  It's not pretty; in fact, in several cases I felt revulsion over their lack of character or integrity.
B007HACDLK|5.0|To me there is no better hero than Mitch Rapp and this book proves why. Mitch is called upon once again to face terrorists and a plot to abduct a fellow agent. Mitch's mission is waylaid by a sudden loss of memory and the road to recover has opened a side of Mitch that few have seen.<br /><br />A definite mission intensive thriller.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the twists and turns in the plot.  Very well written.  I don't want to give anything away, but be prepared for some big surprises.
0525952926|3.0|I like this book...I loved Fall of Giants.  I fell in love with the characters in Fall of Giants.  I loved the history lesson and the fact that the next generation of characters were there was wonderful...but I missed what Mr. Follett usually does with characters.  Seems like trilogies get watered down...maybe because the writer is under pressure to meet a deadline.  I'm listening to the book because I love John Lee's ability to get all of the accents.
193609648X|5.0|Who doesn't love the unique colorations of Noro yarn?  How to use it is the next question.  The cover sold me on this book and inside I found more wonderful items to tempt me.  Lots of books on knitting with Noro, but this gives you great items to crochet with this fabulous yarn!
