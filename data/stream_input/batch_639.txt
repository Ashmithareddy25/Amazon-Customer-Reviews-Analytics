B0002S947K|5.0|Really a great album with a quality sound.  Ray has the feel of the modern folk movement with tones reminiscent of the 60's with a comparitively masculine voice similar to Janis Joplin.  THis guy's got some soul.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I started listening to rock with Iron Maiden, I have all their albums and liked all of them, but this one is in my opinion is the best one. I highly recommend this cd and I am sure if you like Iron, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />See ya...
B000FTWB7G|5.0|this is one of the most amazing cd's i have ever heard <br /> <br />Amy Lee uses her voice to the full potential <br /> <br />anyone interested in Evanescence will fall in love with her hypnotic voice <br /> <br />especially in Snow White Queen.... <br /> <br />so buy it!!
B000J10ERO|1.0|This is a terrible movie which goes to show you should always leave a classic alone.  They made Superman into a guy who drinks beer before flying off to save the world, he uses his supervision to become a \\"peeping tom\\" when he spies on Lois Lane and her boyfriend,and it earned a rating of PG-13!  What parent can understand not being able to take their 7-year-old to see the best superhero ever???  In the original movie Lois was tough and spirited but likeable.  This new Lois is just downright bitchy and annoying.  The special effects are at first impressive but then it just becomes too much.  This movie is a disgrace to Superman fans all around the world.  My time is too valuable to me to be wasted on this junk.  Waner Brothers owes me the $5.00 I spent to rent it.
B000HCO840|4.0|A fitting end to the series, though full of unexpected twists.  The deaths of both Xavier and Cyclops, transformation of Mystique, the choice made by Rogue: never saw these coming. <br />Wolverine and Storm played a large role in the final outcome, though they had to lead from the front as all others were either dead or beginning their careers. <br />It will be interesting to see how the Wolverine spin-offs work, and just where Storm is headed - taking overthe school or still standing with Wolverine and the others.  Question is against what?
B000H0MKO2|4.0|This movie has a little bit of a different feel to it.  It does get better the more you watch it but it just is missing something.  That extra bit of flare.  It is funny, and the storyline is decent, but the flow of the movie is just a little off.
032147404X|5.0|This book is a MUST for beginner or novice photographers.  It's very easy to understand and the methods are right on target.  I've spend hours using the technics Mr Kelby explains.  It's written with a sense of humor and straight to the point technics. I give Mr Kelby an A+ for a job well done.

B000063DFP|5.0|Have just listened to it for the 100th time probably as it was one of my first metal/hard rock records in the middle of the 80s. If you are new to Iron maiden, just listen to it and enjoy, if you are as much of an IM fan as me, just listen to the S. Harris's bass parts for a change -- incredible. A true masterpiece, buy it.
B00009UW0N|4.0|i saw this movie recently in this updated format. its good but was not what i expected from a all time horror classic. I am not saying its bad but its not worth the publicity it gets .
B000957O82|5.0|In Hitch, Will Smith proves he has what it takes to be a great romantic-comedy lead: he's attractive, engaging and very charismatic. This movie is sweet without being maudlin, and much funnier than the average romantic comedy. Eva Mendes makes a great partner for Smith and Kevin James' infatuation/relationship with Amber Valetta is hilarious. Hitch is a perfect date movie.
B000ASDG0S|4.0|I have to say that I am not a celebrity flogger; I try to look at the product, not the personality.  that said, I really liked the chemistry of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  They really looked like they were experiencing something larger than their parts, if that makes sense. <br />A stretch-your-imagination premise, that really was incidental to the acting of all concerned. The vehicle of this movie was the couple, not the plot.  Fun, goofy and worth multiple viewings.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Great production of an epic poem!! Superb cast of performers gave all they had!! Have watched many times now and am spellbound till the end!! Truly a great movie that is sure to be a classic! Spectacular scenery and a  great director and crew with Gerard Butler as Beowulf makes this movie a must-have!! I just can't say enough about Mr. Butler..he is an awesome character actor!!! 5++ stars from us!! <br /> <br />Dvd had no subtitles for us older viewers.
0345440900|1.0|I like the information about baby massage. But other than that??? This book made me feel like an utter failure as a new mother. My son doesn't fit in ANY of her categories for babies and I am with the other reviewers who don't agree with her dislike of 'attachment parenting'. I love my son and I relish every moment of my time with him. If cuddling him before he goes to sleep is bad, then I'll be 'bad'. I'm sorry, but this woman needs to get off her high horse and come to grips with reality. Babies aren't going to go to sleep by telling them, \\"I'm putting you down for a sleep. You know how much better you feel afterward.\\" PLEASE! Don't waste your time with this book.
B000GPIPVU|4.0|When I first heard 'Trouble' I was blown away by its originality; when I first heard the trak \\"Be Here Now\\" from this latest album I actually got a tear in my eye, it's just such a beautiful song. The rest of the album almost lives up to this, especially \\"Empty\\", which lays down the desolation he admits to feeling at times. It makes me want to meet him, to say I understand the never-ending grind of it all becoz he truly nails it. The title track I'd heard before on an early CD, but he's reworked it and it's benefited from some serious production - a lament on our greed and corporate life, it is moving, but then Ray is a consumate songwriter - I don't get the feeling he dashed any of these songs out overnight; they are weighty, moving, insightful and melodic. Personally, I can live without two trax from the CD, but that's personal taste, and if its only two trax, he deserves being bought. And in this era of downloading everything, for me, that's saying something, because I did buy it.

0553583182|3.0|Most of this book is a group of stories of people who've had success using their \\"subconscious\\" to achieve their desired results. It is NOT a step-by-step guide on how to use the principles of the people discussed in this book, although there is a high-level discussion on how to use the principals throughout the book. It's a long book, and I found myself expecting to find the meat of the book at the turn of the next page, never really finding it. Having said that, it's a good book, with lots of positive stories that helped me view things with a fresh and productive perspective. .
0061150142|5.0|This wonderful book is more about a teenage love story than it is about teen suicide. I took me only 5 days to ready the entire thing, while I was on vacation in Hawaii! I thought My Sister's Keeper was good, but I personally like this one so much better.
1582701709|5.0|I'd seen the movie and had wished there was a book for me to read.  Walked into a store and there it was waiting for me at the front door.  Am now about 2/3s the way through this book and it is working like magic for me.  Got the impossible parking space yesterday, have been receiving a check in the mail for several days now, got two surprise days off of work this week for no reason other than I wished for it, a friend I had not spoken to and had been thinking about called me out of the blue to say Hi and I could go on with more examples.  <br /> <br /> My point is read the book with an open mind and just try asking for a few small things to come into your life.  You will be pleasantly amazed how easy and quickly things arrive.   <br /> <br />Have also noticed now that I am regularly saying \\"thank you\\", the world has been such a nice place to be in.  I have complete strangers smiling at me and starting up friendly conversations for no reason.  It has been wonderful and have to say, I am now enjoying life so much more and really mean it when I tell people \\"I feel great!\\"
1577314808|5.0|If you seek spirit, if you are ready for a gentle, yet profound, guide to find your real self, Tolle's voice may speak to you.  If you listen, and really hear, you may find so much more than you could have imagined.  The Power of Now and A New Earth are more than brilliant, they share the vision to shape a new universe.  Tolle holds the wisdom and teachings of the ages and looks at them through the illuminated glass of his enlightenment - and they sparkle with a new understanding.  Also recommend Tolle's DVDs.
0596007124|5.0|Absolutely the best technical book I ever read.   It is fun, methodical, and gets the points straight cross in multiple ways.  Recommended to people who tend to bang their heads with tech books or fall into sleep with them.   Not recommended for those who love reading books others can't understand. <br /> <br />If you are already an expert in Design Patterns, you will find this book too \\"kinder garden\\"; but if you just started learning about Design Patterns, I think there is no better book than this one. <br />

0618680004|4.0|Pro. Richard Dawkins is widely regarded as one of the brightest scientific minds of the twenty first century. He is one of the few geniuses who have plied their trade both in North America and the British Isles. His popular writings are marked by wit and the amazing ability to make complex scientific material understandable to the layman. Prof Dawkins' latest book is no exception.<br /><br />In it he not only re-states his case for principled atheism, he also amasses a wealth of evidence to demonstrate the deleterious effect of the practice of religion across the globe--from warring religious factions in Northern Ireland to the Sunni and Shia conflicts in Iraq, and the murder of Christians in Nigeria. Yet for all this, Dawkins notes, religion is given inextricably special status in our modern world.  He cites as an example the February 2006 ruling by the United States Supreme Court that  a `church in New Mexico should be exempt from the law . . . against the taking of hallucinogenic drugs. . . . [by] Faithful members [who] believe that they can understand God only by drinking hoasca tea, which contains the illegal hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine.' There is also the 2004 case of a twelve year boy in Ohio whose school forbade him from wearing a T-shirt with the words: 'homosexuality is a sin, Islam is a lie, abortion is murder. Some issues are just black and white.' The boy's parents sued the school and had the ban over-turned.<br /><br />But what about the scientific evidence against the existence of God? On this point Prof. Dawkins is confident that life as we know is best explained by a careful study of Darwin's theory of evolution, especially the mechanism of natural selection. So there is no need to resort to the notion of a creator-god. Dawkins is well aware that there are some scientists who hold to a theistic view of evolution and that there are others who consider the God question inconclusive. To prof. Dawkins both of these groups are inconsistent for, to him, Darwinism leads inevitably to atheism. With the present state of scientific knowledge, the chances of God's existence are highly improbable. For prof. Dawkins there is much more hope of finding intelligent life on other planets than to locate God anywhere in our universe of a billion or more galaxies.<br /><br />Yet the professor appears mystified that `We live on a planet where we are surrounded by perhaps ten million species, each one of which independently displays a powerful illusion of apparent design . . . [and that scientists] have calculated that, if the laws and constants of physics had been even slightly different, the universe would have developed in such a way that life would have been impossible.' But all of this, according to Prof. Dawkins, is due to the Darwinian doctrine of natural selection. So in his opinion how was life begun in the first place? His answer is terse but telling: `We can deal with the unique origin of life by postulating a very large number of planetary opportunities. Once that initial stroke of luck has been granted . . . natural selection takes over: and natural selection is emphatically not a matter of luck.'<br /><br />Prof. Dawkins also admits that there are gaps in the evolutionary trajectory but he feels it `is illogical to demand complete documentation of every step of any narrative, whether in evolution or any other science. You might as well demand, before convicting somebody of murder, a complete cinematic record of the murderer's every step leading up to the crime, with no missing frames.' And by that same token, I might add, shouldn't the Hebrew sacred narratives and the Christian Testament be given a fair hearing? And if God does not exist, why so militant?inism leads inevitably to atheism. With the present state of scientific knowledge, the chances of God's existence are highly improbable. For prof.

B000JJRIO8|1.0|This album may be good for just the average fan of hip-hop as it is today, but is sickening for a real fan of 2Pac. Capitalizing on the state of rap, most of the featuring artists aren't actually any good, nor do they have anything to do with 2Pac, they are just the people that have been selling the most records lately. They say only one verse on this album is recycled from a previous album, which I would have to say is a lie. <br /> <br />3 of the tracks have remixed versions of themselves on the album. Meaning that the tracklisting could be cut down from 13 to 10. <br /> <br />Of those 10 songs, 2 were on the Makaveli & Dillinger CD, while rare, still exists. <br /> <br />Meaning 8 songs on this CD are original. <br /> <br />Of these 8 songs, most are modeled to be some sort of pseudo-southern style, with hooks that splice some of Pac's old lyrics together in a quick attempt at sounding catchy. <br /> <br />Soon as I get Home is a good track, featuring Yaki Kadafi, and the original beat by QDIII. Other than that, you're pretty much just left to pray that another 2Pac album will come out soon that will sort out this whole mess. <br /> <br />I know that if your a Pac fan your going to buy this anyway, but just don't get your hopes up for another classic. At least not this time around.

0307236722|4.0|I feel like I have an average stocked kitchen, however I do not own a \\"pastry blender\\" as the first recipe I tried called for, and there were no suggestions as to what to do without one. I can't imagine this is a common kitchen item. Additionally, I was upset to find that some of the recipes with hard to find ingredients did not offer alternatives, and though Living Magazine gives sources as how to find these materials via the internet or phone, the book does not. Additionally, I was frustrated that the book has a hard time staying open on it's own, due to it's binding. I know that there are cookbook holders that would help, but it seems like Martha would be more practical.<br /><br />However, the book itself is beautiful, and a pleasure to look at. Even my husband noticed, and he has zero interest in cooking. I do enjoy looking at it, and was pleased that it was not all the same recipes from the magazine.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is my all time favorite Sci Fi series.. I didn't even know about Firefly  when it first came out because FOX bungled the release and played the episodes in the wrong order. I caught the first five episodes on my Tivo during a Sci-Fi channel marathon, and I was instantly hooked. I bought the Firefly Box Set and the movie, Serenity the same day. Firefly is part Sci-Fi, Part Western, and I just wish there was more than one season to love.

B00005JPCD|2.0|\\"Happy Feet\\", written by Warren Coleman, John Collee, George Miller & Judy Morris; directed by George Miller.<br /><br />Computer technology continues to advance in filmmaking, creating vivid tableaus with a staggering amount of detail. It's unfortunate, then, that the stories beneath the polish are increasingly wispy. In the case of \\"Happy Feet\\", the latest bid for the family filmgoing box office, it's primarily \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", but inflated to staggering proportions. Does a simple story of a plucky misfit penguin really need to start with a cosmic zoom from outer space?<br /><br />Swooping through hordes of singing waterfowl, the camera focuses on two crooning lovers - Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) who fall in love, conveniently, during mating season. It's not clear why Elvis and Marilyn are evoked here, beyond the fact that their personalities (as well as their romance) are plug-and-play. Before long, Mama's off to find food, leaving Dad with egg duty. Since most of this is covered more effectively in \\"March Of the Penguins\\", it's shorthanded here. Even Memphis' accident - he drops his egg, but recovers it before it freezes - evokes little in the way of drama. Happily, it still hatches when the weather breaks, but something is amiss. Little Mumble (as he's later called) taps and shuffles his webbed feet incessantly, to the horror of the others.<br /><br />We learn that all the singing is critical to cartoon penguins - it's how they express themselves, especially to prospective mates. Not only does this have nothing to do with real penguin behavior, it robs Mumble's quirk of any real contrast. Why is dancing anathema to singing penguins, aside from the fact that it'll dovetail into a love duet with Mumble's childhood friend Gloria later on? Rather than stick with the misfit angle, it turns out that penguins are superstitious - they think Mumble's tapping is affecting the local fish population - it's low, and folks are hungry and worried.<br /><br />At any rate, the motley bunch of arbitrary ethnicities soon send Mumble out on his own tiny ice floe, just like Rudolph. He then finds new friends in a distant community of Latino penguins, led by feisty, diminutive Ram&oacute;n (the voice of every secondary character in animation, Robin Williams). Some shtick ensues, and the film then takes a turn into \\"Ferngully: The Last Rainforest\\" territory.<br /><br />They've all run across evidence that there's more to the region than the local flora and fauna, so they troop off to learn more from the local playboy/guru, Lovelace (also voiced by Williams). He's evasive, but we eventually learn that, yes, Man has entered the forest. A nearby oil refinery is the real culprit, not tap dancing. How can Mumble - netted up for his trouble, and now ensconced in a Sea-World-esque aquarium - convince men not to overfish in the region? Naturally, by the very thing that made him an outcast. We don't really see, though, how his dancing convinced the zoo owners - Mumble simply returns home with a tracking device on his back. Once the trackers spot the entire community desperately tapping in unison, the U.N. lowers the boom, and equilibrium is restored. End on a shot of our happy planet.<br /><br />Computer penguins can be appealing, but they've got nothing on the real thing. The production is lavish - the cloud work is lovely, the oil refinery is a wealth of rusty patina, and the sense of scale is impressive - but the story has little emotional weight or cohesion, even for a cartoon. The middle section, where Mumble finds his footing with Ram&oacute;n, is the most entertaining - Ram&oacute;n and his friends act the most like real penguins, waddling about with their flippers in mid-air. Mumble towers above his new pals with an endearing gawkiness. The animation positions itself between anthropomorphism and realism, with mixed results. The voice work, aside from Mr. Williams, is mostly marquee value - the leads bring little to the dramatic or musical proceedings.<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is a step up from the awkward \\"Babe: A Pig In The City\\", but it's dispiriting to see George Miller seem so at-odds with filmmaking after the vitality and confidence of his \\"Road Warrior\\" pictures. His prediliction for harsher tones and blunt rhythms seems out of place in children's films (even \\"Lorenzo's Oil\\" suffered from it). There's been a few live-action directors (Miller, Zemeckis, and Besson come to mind) in recent years who seem to have been seduced by the wealth of control animation can offer. Unfortunately, just because you can make a thousand penguins sing and dance, doesn't mean you necessarily should.tle to the dramatic or musical proceedings. <br /> <br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is a step up from the awkward \\"Babe: A Pig In The City\\", but it's dispiriting to see George Miller seem so at-odds with filmmaking after the vitality and confidence of his \\"Road Warrior\\" pictures.

0618680004|5.0|While the West is battling for its cultural life against fanatic Islamists who are looking to impose their religious beliefs on the world, there is another war churning our intellects - a war that has been raging since Charles Darwin offered up his theory that evolution and natural selection were the reasons for plants, animals and us.  <br /> <br />Richard Dawkins is on the side that claims there is no God, and no need for God, either as a bulwark of morality or as a creator of everything that exists, In fact, the existence of the universe is not proof that God exists because we know the Universe exists but there is no proof of God.  <br /> <br />Dawkins writes well (this is the second book of his that I have read - the other was the brilliant \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\") but he is emotional about this topic, perhaps too emotional. He cites, correctly, biblical passages where the God of the Bible (known as Yahweh or Jehovah) sounds as if he is absolutely crazy, as well as vindictive, infantile, and jealous (remember the First Commandment). <br /> <br />He also criticizes the New Testament and it's philosophy as repulsive - especially Original Sin and the glorification of crucifixion as a means by which Original Sin is forgiven for mankind. He rails against the concept of purgatory, heaven and hell. <br /> <br />Dawkins believes that science is the only way to attain knolwedge and that religious \\"knowledge\\" is no such thing - religion is superstition masquerading as an answer to the everything that we don't understand.  <br /> <br />Dawkins is especially harsh on America's religious tendencies - he berates the abortion bombings and puts them in league with Islamic fascism. Of course, the number of abortion doctors killed by such bombs is not even a percent of the number of people killed by terrorists. But Dawkins' view is that all religion is bad. He does not think an educated person can buy into the God doctrine. <br /> <br />I felt that Dawkins missed a great opportunity to expound on the flaws of the proofs for the existence of God - but he was so wound up during that chapter that his essential criticism came down to the equivalent of \\"these arguments are silly.\\"  <br /> <br />If you are involved in any way in the war of religion versus atheism, this is a must-read book. Dawkins is the Pontiff of Atheism - a position he gladly enjoys.
B000003FMY|5.0|Fritz Reiner brings out the best in Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition with full clear presentations of each section of the piece. The clarity of the recording is just great.
B000002UAU|5.0|I mean, seriously.  You read some of these reviews - particularly the negative ones, but not just them - and they don't so much as make mention of the album as a piece of work in itself.  It's really kind of sad.  This is why I don't like any public forum without a warm, fleshy editor reading what goes up on it. <br /> <br />When it comes to this record, there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said.  At the time it was composed, it served (along with Pet Sounds, Freak Out!, and various others) to cement the album as the cohesive unit of popular music, as opposed to the single.  It's not as though there's a conspiracy amidst sundry editors in the musical publication business to make this particular record sound like it's better than it is.  The album is packed full of quality material, and is a must-own for any comprehensive rock or pop collection. <br /> <br />That said, the record certainly isn't as good as some people make it out to be.  The sitar is the single worst thing to ever happen to Western music (sorry, Ravi Shenkar, but you wasted your life), and I could have gone all the rest of my years without having to sit through \\"Within You, Without You\\" without ever regretting the fact that I missed it.  It's long, droning, and inconveniently placed.  Some of the lyrics (particularly those contributed by John Lennon in places) tend towards juvenile psychedelia for the sake of juvenile psychedelia (\\"Lucy in the Sky\\" for instance). <br /> <br />There are all sorts of things that you could hold against this album if you wanted to.  If you put it in a room with Revolver, I'm not sure which one I'd pick as best (I tend to lean toward Revolver at this point, but it's also fresher for me).  That does not, however, mean that THIS record is not excellent. <br /> <br />Beach Boys evangelists will tell you Pet Sounds is better.  I'm still chewing on that one (I have a hard time with that record), but it's mostly an irrelevant discussion.  Hard rock and underground evangelists will tell you it's too \\"mainstream\\" (whatever that means, as though being popular is somehow a blight on the merit of a particular artistic work), or maybe criticize (unjustly, particularly in the case of this album, where so much of it is created with studio effects) the talent of the individual members.  These are just smoke blown to distract you from the meat of the album itself.  I am no stump-speaker for the Beatles.  I have some issues with most of the stuff they released prior to Rubber Soul (by the way, if you really, really like, say, \\"Love Me Do\\" but can't really warm up to \\"Penny Lane\\" or \\"I Am the Walrus\\" you might be unhappy here).  But that doesn't change the fact that this is an influential, entertaining work of popular music that any self-respecting collector ought to own.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|Maybe everyone knows this, but my friend Andrew and I noticed that the nurse at the end of the credits looked like the same one we saw briefly on a television screen in Xavier's opening scene. Sure enough, same girl. You know, the one that was working in the room with the mutant vegetable... Now that's a well thought out movie! If you still don't get it, listen to Charles' dialogue for the entire scene.

B000C20VPA|4.0|This edition is not the 10th Anniversary Edition, this is the \\"Special Edition\\", the difference being that this is a) cheaper b) not a flipper c) misses out on a bunch of all the documentary little features that are on the other one. I was surprised, it never happened to me but after I read some reviews I wondered where all the extras are. Well turns out I bought this edition instead of the 10th Anniversary Edition... Well, they just dropped a few things and sell it for a few dollars less.<br /><br />One of my all time favorite movies nonetheless, I'll just trade it in for the other edition at some point.

0887307280|3.0|This book was very, very good in terms of the misunderstanding mindset one can have in running a personal business.  I found it very enlightening in terms of realizing how to change my concepts in order to better run my business.  The development of repetitive systems amd procedures set off a light bulb. <br /> <br />The ultimate message, however, does not apply to all business, so I highly recommend the first half of the book, and suggest if one is interested in a McDonald's style operation to read the second half.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Cleverly written scripts and very entertaining.  I can't imagine why this series was on the hit list.  I originally purchased this series as a gift for my son and have since watched it with him.  You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this series, only someone that yearns for some really fun entertainment and a good ride!
B000FDEU12|5.0|There will be no strife in the world if we could all sit back and listen to the poetry of \\"Continuo.\\"<br /><br />I had to go to Amazon just to find Avishai Cohen, the new heavy-hitter of jazz bass and an exceptional composer.<br /><br />Listen to Avishai Cohen's compositions played on his accoustic and electric basses with Sam Barch on the piano, Mark Guiliana, drums and percussion -- and get this, Amos Hoffman on the oud.<br /><br />The oud, a mideastern stringed instrument, has the exotic pluck of all that is good about the world.<br /><br />\\"Continuo,\\" is a world of wonderful listening.  Cohen's other CD in my Collection, \\"Colors\\" is another marvel.
1931788340|5.0|This is a very nice book featuring the worls of Stephen Shore. As usual Aperture put together a very nice book. The printing and binding are top notch. <br /> <br />If you have never seen the work of Stephen Shore you are in for a real treat. His classic urban landscapes are very original and are beautifully done in this book
B0009UC7HA|3.0|I enjoyed the book, and bought the DVD as a gift for my son, thinking it would be much the same, with gadgety boats, cool cars, Indiana Jones type action, and a bit of horror movie thrown in.  The movie didn't deliver - it sort of picked and chose what parts of the book to use.  If I hadn't had such high expectations, the movie would have been more enjoyable, as it did have believable characters and a good plot and moved along for the most part (sometimes it lingered over scenery a bit much).  So if you want a good action movie and haven't read the book, this should fit the bill.  But if you read the book and want to see the movie bring it to life, don't get your hopes up.
B000F8O35U|3.0|Following closely behind Pocahontas, Little Mermaid was a favourite Disney movie of mine. I had the doll (with removable tail) and also the Eric doll - although I preferred my Ken doll.<br /><br />I still prefer the older Disney movies to the ones these days. These days, it's all about the celebrity voices, and how many you can spot before the credits roll. Back in the days of Little Mermaid, Cinderella etc, there are no celebrity voices. And it makes you slip into the movie easier, without having to think of the voice, before you can concentrate on the film.<br /><br />Little Mermaid still holds the magic it had for me when I was young. I remember being so scared when I was younger that I actually used to skip the bits featuring Ursula, the sea witch. Now, I laugh, but I still feel that same old fear. Especially the ending. Was I the only one freaked out by that?!<br /><br />Little Mermaid will shown to my kids (when I have them), rather than Cars, or any other recent Disney movies. I just don't get them. And I have no urge to watch them.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is by far S.W.:s best album. It's ambitous and it blends loads of different musical styles. My peronal favourites are the soft, very pretty \\"Summer soft\\", \\"ordinary pain\\" and the funky hilarious \\"Contusion\\".<br /><br />This album is a must-have for sure. People talk a lot about Inner visions and Talking book, but this is the one. The golden album. The diamond.
B00005JO1R|3.0|Prior to watching this, I'd never heard of Johnny Cash. Apart from the fact he'd died, and someone on American Idol had sang \\"Walk The Line\\", which I absolutely loved the lyrics to. For some reason, I just had to get this film. My dad asked me why, my mum asked me why, my boyfriend asked me why, and I had no really good answer to give them. I just wanted to see it.<br /><br />I have no real interest in Joaquin Phoenix either. He irritates me. Yes, I like Reese Witherspoon, but the film isn't about her. But apparently, he's really well suited to the role (you forget it's actually him soon enough, even that annoying scar which looks like a cleft palate), and has an alright voice.<br /><br />Both of the actors did their own vocals, taking six months vocal training to learn and be Johnny & June Cash. I had to actually put the subtitles on for Reese Witherspoon though, with a strong southern accent, I could not understand a word the girl was saying! The songs were could, toe tapping but forgettable - apart from \\"Walk The Line\\".<br /><br />My one quibble about Walk The Line, is the fact huge chunks of time were deemed not important enough to be included in the film, making the film seem almost jumpy. There is some stuff I would have dumped in order to see more of his early life, and most importantly, life after him & June finally got married & got together. After getting married, they were together 35 years, why not show some more of that?<br /><br />I have to applaud Reese, she did hold her own in the film, a role that could have been reduced to a few lines, a song, and more a redneck hick role.<br /><br />Elvis also appears in this, and although he's not in it for long, he really irritated me, as they could have chosen a better Elvis lookalike from all the thousands that there are out there! I have never seen a guy look less like Elvis ever.<br /><br />It does get slightly boring in parts, as I've said before, there are big jumps in time, and you feel like there's something in there that could have been shown, and the ending was a bit of a let down. But the film holds well, as do Reese & Joaquin's voices, but I'm still at a loss to why he was so popular.<br /><br />I keep a close watch on this heart of mine<br /><br />I keep my eyes wide open all the time<br /><br />I keep the ends out for the tie that binds<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />I find it very, very easy to be true<br /><br />I find myself alone when each day is through<br /><br />Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />As sure as night is dark and day is light<br /><br />I keep you on my mind both day and night<br /><br />And happiness I've known proves that it's right<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />You've got a way to keep me on your side<br /><br />You give me cause for love that I can't hide<br /><br />For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the linethere's something in there that could have been shown, and the ending was a bit of a let down.

B00005MNP7|5.0|This album isn't usually rated as blondies finest, but I suret hink it is! They were at the peak of their commercial success when it was released. And it is an inspired work, with both punky outbursts (title song for example) and AOR-like majestic sounds, like \\"Union city blue\\".<br /><br />The sweet \\"Dreaming\\", the lullabye-esque \\"Shayla\\", the wondrous little ironic piece called \\"Die young stay pretty\\". This is an indispensible<br /><br />album.
0060531053|5.0|Very complete step-by-step instructions for brewing beer. The book is logically organized, beginning with very basic all-extract brewing, then moving on to more complicated methods. It includes instructions on how to use the equipment as well, vital for the complete novice. You can read only what you need to know, or read more in-depth explanations of how yeast works, what enzymes the grains produce at what temperatures for converting starches to sugars (for mashing), the chemistry side of brewing; really technical stuff. <br /> <br />The phrase he keeps repeating, \\"Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew,\\" doesn't annoy me in the least. In fact, I look forward to coming across it when reading the book. Every time I see that phrase, I pop a top. Makes reading and brewing so much more rewarding!! It's supposed to be fun so have fun with it. <br /> <br />I've been brewing for 13 years. I started with \\"New Complete Joy of Homebrewing (2nd Ed)\\" back then. I passed my old copy on to someone else and replaced it with the 3rd edition when it came out. With reasonable care, the book will (obviously) last you many years, and it only costs $10 on Amazon. What a deal for the wealth of information in here. <br /> <br />The all-extract brew is very easy to do. Basic instructions are given for taking temperature (hint: use bottled water, and refrigerate it; then you don't need a wort chiller), using the hydrometer to assure complete fermentation before bottling (necessary if you ever enter a competition; and, do you want to bottle it if it's not done yet??), sanitizing, step-by-step what you need to know to brew your first batch of beer. After 13 years, I still keep the book out when brewing just to keep on track. <br /> <br />The charts are invaluable and I use them to \\"design\\" my brews. I've moved on to using grains in my brews. Not sure I'll ever do all-grain brewing, but I know where to look if I ever want to try it!! <br /> <br />I've read other books on homebrewing, and even after brewing for years, I'd be confused and not know where to start after reading those books. They did not lay out step-by-step what to do like this one does. <br /> <br />If you're really serious about trying homebrewing, then you should get this book. It will be interesting to you if it's something you really want to get into, regardless of the style of writing or the paper it's printed on. If you have to be entertained with pretty pictures, insets, eye-catching layouts, glossy paper and expensive bindings in order to read a book, then don't get this book. It's a no-frills publication; buy it for the wealth of information it contains and the education you'll receive. <br /> <br />Your first batch should be \\"Linda's Lovely Light\\" on pg. 211. You'll be hooked on homebrew! Relax....
B0000AI45P|5.0|If there were 34 098 stars possible for this review this record would get'em all... I'm both a rock chic and a disco madame, but let me tell ya 'bout this fantastic amazing mind blowing rock album. It blew me away at the age of 17 and it still does, although I must have listened to it about a billion times.<br /><br />My favourite one on the album i \\"Guiding light\\". So soft, so brittle, so fierce and so I-just-can't-find-the-words. Heavenly.<br /><br />So have some red wine, some strong fags and let's get down to it. It's a wondrous trip.<br /><br />And, oh, those guitars.
0743490304|5.0|This book would never be considered my favorite or one I would put on anyone's must read before you die list, but it was a fun little book as I find all of Dan Brown's conspiracy books. I classify it as useless mind candy. No life-changing work, no soul-stirring drama, but a great airplane or sunning at the beach book.
B00000ILGL|5.0|Moroder's a hero! A true visionary man that created (among so many others...) Donna Summer's \\"Bad Girls\\", one of my all time fave albums.<br /><br />This one is as essential for a disco fan, as some Velvet Underground record is to a rock fan. Do I need to say more???
B00000JFV9|4.0|What a great sounding cd.  The movie was a long time ago but the distinct voice of Curtis Mayfield is profound and unmatched to this day. <br />
B00003CX8U|5.0|This movie changed my life. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's such a mesmerizring epic of a rather revolting, self-indulgent man. But he's sexy. He's interesting. The characters are allowed to take some time to develop - and not only Roy Scheider's. Sure his part is misogynic and oversexed, but the film isn't. It's so beautiful. The music is great - the initial audtitioning scenes and Benson's fantastic \\"On Broadway\\" is exquisite, for example.<br /><br />It never gets cheesy, although one might fear that sexy \\"air hostesses\\" with leather peaked caps singing about eager services and airborne zestfulness, should end up in some tragic \\"Emanuelle on Broadway\\" kitsch.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Unlike some of the older music by Bob Dylan, you can actually understand the words.  His raspy blues voice just adds to the music.  This is the first cd/album that I've purchased in over 10 years by this artist and I must admit he still has talent.
B00009NHC5|4.0|A story of a doll filled with drugs that falls into the hands of a lady recently made blind and the criminals that try to trick her into giving it to them.<br /><br />All I can say is it's a pretty good movie.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|The five stars are for the performances and recordings. For my taste, Uchida and Tate are the ones to have for the Mozart concertos. But there are two things you should know before you buy this set:  1) The first four of Mozart’s numbered concertos are not included. Actually, these aren’t really by Mozart—they’re his arrangements of music by other composers. Frankly, I don’t miss them.  2) Both the 16th and the 19th concertos are begun on one disk and continued on another. Obviously this is a cost-cutting measure. But I find it annoying to have to shuttle between two disks to hear one concerto. I dealt with this by burning concertos 16 and 19 to a single disk and including it with my boxed set. If you don’t want to do this, or you don’t have the equipment to burn a CD, then you need to decide if shuttling between two CDs for these two concertos is worth the money you’ll save in buying this budget set. Spreading a single Mozart concerto over two disks is simply unacceptable—an example of a decision made by people with no aesthetic judgment. Either redo the order of the concertos in the 8 disk set, or add one more disk.  The music and performances, of course, are sublime. The perfection of Mozart’s music is matched by Uchida’s flawless and tasteful playing.
B000HA4W4S|3.0|To ape is a sincere form of flattery indeed. Were there to be a remake of Saturday Night Fever, the score could be done by these guys (& girl).It was that Bee Gee like quality of I Don't Feel Like Dancing that made me get this lp after hearing the single a few times. Maybe the single is all one needs. It's not that the songs that constitute the rest of the disc are bad. They're not. It is simply that while they continue down the Bee Gees' path they are traveling in the ruts and not deviating from the formula which they can't pull off with the Bee Gees aplomb. While being more a fan of the 60s Bee Gees and not the disco era I do think that they produced a handful of classics in the 70s. This album contains one at best. A little more adventurousness is needed to make the Scissor Sisters memorable a decade from now.<br /><br />Oh yeah. Avoid the special packaging. The songs are not on the original disc for a reason and the difficulty in opening and closing the package is unnecessary.
006054094X|5.0|Most of us know China has a rich written history...pioneering everything from religion to metallurgy.  Although I haven't spent significant time researching the truth contained in the book, it doesn't take much faith to believe a lot of what Gavin says is true.  The book was a great read. Opened my eyes to many new and interesting world history events. He has a website for people to follow up on his hypothesis.  If you are a nieve North American or European looking to open your eyes.....it's a great place to start.
B000GY729M|5.0|Let's see where this goes. Sam's Town might be short for Uncle Sam's Town. That then might mean America's Town and then it becomes America's music. That might flow if rock made up a better percentage of the music listened to and purchased in this country. It's not that the genre doesn't have bands with talent. These guys are very good and there are many mmoe; e.g. Hold Steady.. Maybe they're the best American rock band out there now. I have trouble hanging the rock tag on band's like Nickleback that get their primary airplay from the psuedo hair-ballads from the 80s. This disc rocks and if you haven't heard it---get it. Maybe a newer version is on the way. Kind of Shakiraesque in that the song getting all the airplay now is the \\"Xmas\\" song:A Big Sled and not on this lp. Worth waiting a little bit to see if it gets added to this disc. But don't let this slip by you if you're a rock fan.

0393316041|5.0|That's the way it seemed when I read this book.  Feynman's authorial voice is friendly, intimate, unassuming, and unique.  I found it delightful.  The entire book is a gas, fascinating, and educational.  Feynman seems like just the kind of guy you'd like to hang out with.  He can be a real PITA, but also funny as hell, and always interesting.  I really didn't want the book to end (fortunately there are others by him that I haven't read yet).  Feynman has a way of thinking that moves into your own brain.  I keep catching myself thinking when faced with a problem \\"Now how would Richard approach this?\\" <br /> <br />There's not much hard science here but I did get a good sense about some aspects of the sociology and methodology of contemporary physics.  Feynman also has interesting ideas about art, music, culture, and people.  Some of the anecdotes are historically important, especially the episodes at Los Alamos.   <br /> <br />Feynman seems to be painfully honest in places--how many would admit to peccadilloes like spending six nights a week in a strip club--but elsewhere his anecdotes seem confabulated.  One description of a philosophical discussion at Princeton when he was a grad student there is absolutely implausible unless Princeton philosophy grad students were a lot worse than I'm sure they were.  This is something I know something about.  That conversation did not take place the way Feynman describes it.  Who cares?  (I do a little.)  Also Feynman takes a completely gratuitous pot shot at the Cornell philosophy department, which at that time and still today is one of the best in the US. <br /> <br />Feynman is also a bit of a phony, especially in his apparent distain for the Nobel Prize.  I guarantee you he would have been mortally crushed if he had not gotten the Nobel (and rightly so!).  He's also overbearing toward the end of the book where he discusses \\"cargo cult science,\\" although the basic point that Feynman is trying to make is deeply important IMO.  The thing is the guy's human, very human; he comes across that way--fleshy, a little nerdy, excitable, not always dependable, compulsive, and unpredictable, self-involved, cool sometimes, brilliantly original in an unpretentious way sometimes, and a great story teller.   <br /> <br />Reading this book is a wonderful very human experience.
B000J103PC|5.0|This is the Mother of all \\"Women's Work\\" movies and the very best,truely on mark corporate eyeful. I loved this film for the story, the idenitfiability of the characters among your own peers and the wise life lessons portrayed in a real, not sticky, way. I left with the illusion of understanding how people might get to the top and stay there and how other decisions based in values could help redirect your life. All the kinds of love are there as well,passion,devotion,acceptance,loyalty,wicked and good stuff.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I was amazed at this box office sleeper.  I absolutely loved the premise and the attention to detail.  The concept of being able to communicate with someone in another timeframe was done excellently (the SciFi element).  So far, I have watched this about seven times, each time with another friend and we have all enjoyed it.  It's not often you see a film you don't mind seeing over and over again.  Keanu and Sandra were each great in their roles.
B000GRUS22|4.0|I own all of Enigma's albums and many of their single's.  This latest album has some great songs that resemble some on their earlier work, which I prefer. I would highly recommend it!
B000ELJBAA|5.0|Was happy with whole process.You do great job getting orders sent on timely manner even titles hard to find.Other business should take lessons from you. I can also court on you for great delivery and assistance finding and getting older cd's and books.Again many thanks  Chris
B000I5X81K|4.0|OK, let's cut to the chase:  You probably won't hate this album.  Then again, if you're looking for a repeat of his two MASSIVE hit albums, this isn't it. <br /> <br />The music is very pleasant, even romantic at times, and Groban is maturing as an artist while continuing to entertain and charm the ardent.   <br /> <br />But there isn't a great, important piece like you found in the first two albums, either.  Don't get me wrong - I like the album, and I think it's very unfair to expect every artist to hit a one-pitch grand slam with every release.  If you never heard him before, you'll be impressed by his power and talent.  The die-hard Grobanites are either going to love it \\"just because\\" or hate it because its not what they are used to. <br /> <br />Me?  I like it, I play it and I would buy it again.  It's just that it's not an automatic like the first two.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|If you want this movie, purchase the 2000 version. This one is glitchy and everytime a character moves or walks, the film jumps a little bit. It almost looks like its part of the film and if you hadn't seen the film before, you wouldn't even notice. But I did. Get the 2000 version which has cooler special features and a funny menu selection - they loop the dead-cat scene over and over. I'm going to try and get my money back on this version. But Eraserhead is such a great visionary film. Bizarre and grotesque, yet visionary.
0099487829|1.0|Certain conventions are adhered to in juvenile fiction. One of the biggest is that \\"everything is going to be OK in the end.\\" The hero may endure changes, loss, and pain, but learns from the experience. After all, the point is not to thoroughly depress young readers and turn them off books. Downer endings are saved for adult fiction, or are carefully dosed in non-fiction (such as the telling of Anne Frank's life) <br /> <br />In my opinion, the author of this book takes a really cheap shot at the end with a conclusion wholly inappropriate for his youthful audience. I know the Holocaust is a miserable subject, but that doesn't innoculate the author from using good judgement. The ending is nothing less than a manipulative sucker punch.  <br /> <br />This book has a voice, a flow, a style, and a vocabulary level suitable for 4th grade and older. Even the book presentation is coy and attractive. However, I would not reccomend this title for anyone below the 10th grade. Even then, I would urge other non-fiction titles, such as the Diary of Anne Frank. This book is not wholly without merit. Other reviewers have justly praised examples of fine writing. And I was wholly engaged in this tense and compelling read until the offensive ending. Just because this novel is about the Holocaust doesn't make it sacred. Don't waste money on this shabby shocker when so many better books are out there. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0375501851|3.0|I bought this book solely on a review in Time magazine and expected to be blown away by the talent emanating from Ms. Smith. However, after forcing myself to read at least half of it, I find myself dragging my feet to finish the other half. It is simply not compelling. Perhaps it is a bigger hit in London but I don't understand why everyone is falling all over themselves about this book!
B000002LCB|5.0|Besides the movie being one of our family's all-time favorites, this was a special purchase because we used selected tracks as processional and recessional music for our daughter's wedding.  It turned out beautifully!  Thanks, Mark!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|I'm not going to talk about how I think the director should stick to comedy (or nothing at all). Of the trilogy, this one had the least amount of acting and character development. The special effects, although great, do not a great movie make. Focusing more on storm was not a bad idea, but I've never been a huge fan of Berry's acting. The casting decision for Beast and the makeup were very well done. The movie just tries to do to much in a short amount of time. Characters die, and I find myself scratching my head \\"I should probably be feeling something right now. Am I sad? Angry at their death? Dah well.\\" One character dies and you really don't even know it, as it isn't shown, and it is very little referenced until a grave stone at the end.
1878424319|1.0|I read half of the book and was so disappointed I threw it in the trash.  I think the \\"agreements\\" are basic, no nonsense ideas on how to live a better life.  You don't need this book to teach you these things.  As a Christian, it went against my beliefs of what \\"truth\\" is.  Lots of new-age (book calls it Toltec Wisdom) mumble jumble.   I read a passage to one of my Christian friends and he couldn't believe the garbage I was reading.  Instead, pick up Rick Warren's \\"Purpose Driven Life\\" or Joel Osteen's \\"Your Best Life Now\\" - 2 books I highly recommend if you want \\"Personal Freedom\\".

0671015206|5.0|If you have ever thought \\"We make a good living, why don't we have any money\\" then you need to read this book.  It will show you how people truly accumulate wealth.  And you'll be really surprised who it is.  It's probably not your neighbor driving the 7-series BMW.  I know several people like those described in this book - decent but moderate wage earners in their 50s who spend their money wisely but still enjoy themselves, and have $1M+ in assets to show for it.  It has changed how I think about money, and how I spend, save, and invest it.  With some self-disicpline it is possible to acheive that financial security we all dream of.  It's a great book - get it on CD and listen to it in the car.

B000GFLE86|5.0|This voice is so reminescent of Bille Holiday and other chanteuse of the past. It is just pure pleasure to listen to every note and phrase. Each track has it's own unique and sweet soul offered up by a vocal magician. There is a haunting and poignant quality in her voice that makes you pay attention.  <br /> <br />I wait for every new morsel recorded.
0060555661|4.0|This is a great guide to developing one's personal investment portfolio.  It dispells the myths and claims by those pundits that declare they have discovered ways to beat the market. It makes clear distinctions between speculation and investment, and puts forward sound principles for investments.   <br /> <br />It would be easier for those who have basic but proper training in stock valuations to understand the text and where the authors are coming from.  But laymans should also find it a very useful guide.
B000059GEH|5.0|This movie is always touted as a Marilyn Monroe pic but Lauren Bacall is the real star here.  Fabulous costumes and some great lines.  Bacall and Grable both get in some little jabs at their real-life husbands at the time.

Even convinced husband to read series, only reads tech, mechanial & sports literature also became hooked.  We have actually read most of them twice, which he has never done.  by the way, we are grandparents and I am an avid reader.
B000B7BRMM|2.0|I loved the editorial review of this album when it began saying, 'as the song goes, \\"Merry Christmas\\" has already \\"been said many times, many ways' but I disagreed when Ms. Leah Weathersby said \\"Diana Krall's Christmas Songs is a worthy -though not particularly unique -addition to the holiday catalog.'<br /><br />In fact there is nothing worthy here beyond the beautiful photos of a beautiful woman set by a marketing department which seems to be selling cosmetics or alike. Maybe they think music is just a plus. A not worthy plus containing the same old Xmas repertoire with a neglectable approach.<br /><br />Sounds like a false variation when Ms. Krall engages in pretending she is creating something that's nothing on her funny approach with no fun modifications in 'Jingle Bells' wrapped in a band swinging that does not convince.<br /><br />Who told Ms. Krall she must record a Christmas album?!
B0000TB050|5.0|Every time I see U2 perform I fall deeper in love with them. This time they put on a great performance; their choice of songs and showmanship really sweep you away.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This is my third Skagen watch.  The design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light. The design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear. They have proven to be reliable timekeepers and I liked this one so much I bought two more for my sons. At less than $80.00 each they are a real bargin.

B00006AW2S|5.0|I still own this LP that got me into the British rock invasion of the sixties. Other reviewers will give you more history of releases, what songs were included or not, etc.  <br />I wanted to review it because this record (sorry...CD) is probably one of my favorite Stones album and so it was natural to get the remastered CD version.  <br />To me, the song selection is ideal. There's not a dog in the bunch! Some of the slick production we've gotten used to may be lacking on some tracks but it is more than made up with the raw spontaneity and power of the group. These guys really lived (and continue to live) for the music they made and it shows with the amazing staying power they have exhibited for over 40 years!  <br /> <br />Buy this CD....this is what Rock 'n' Roll is all about.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I'm sure you've met people who are so Very Ugly that they're actually Beautiful.  [Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl.]  You've heard music that's so cacophonous that it actually becomes quite listenable in spite of itself.  [Webern springs to mind.]  You've seen video sights so austere that they seem somehow friendly.  [A howling blizzard in Antarctica perhaps, viewed from the warm safety of your living room.]<br /><br />In the same fashion, there are movies so bad that they become not only Good, but even Great.  This movie is almost one of those.  Almost.<br /><br />First there's the humor.  Early on, it's so strained-at that when you finally get to things that really are funny, such as the Alan Arkin character's diatribe about 'Lots of 'em,' you have forgotten how to laugh.<br /><br />Some reviewers have remarked on how well dysfuntionality is captured here.  Yes, the teenager's angst is well portrayed, but all of the other bickering, shouting, intervening, and sulking seems contrived.<br /><br />The satire on tiny tot beauty pageants is so over the top that you want to crawl under your chair and hide, especially from the smarmy M.C., who must be every little kid's worst nightmare.  The point is made in the first five seconds.  After that it's just painful.<br /><br />On the other hand-- and it's a big one-- Miss Breslin is fantastic.  She rescues the movie from going down the tubes.  She's not all that functional herself, but in comparison with the rest of her assorted relatives, she's eminently sane.  And, yes, as other reviewers have said, her act in the talent competition is wonderful, amazing, and memorable-- getting the movie's point across very nicely.  And in the nick of time, too.<br /><br />But the highlight of the movie comes a little earlier, in a scene between the Breslin character and the Arkin one-- that is, between granddaughter and grandfather.  He tells her she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and she shyly demurs.  But he insists, and then comes up with a great line to the effect that \\"And I'm saying that, not because of the brilliance of your mind, or your precocious intellect, or because of your accomplishments, but because you're goddamned gorgeous.\\"  The fact that she is anything BUT gorgeous gives the scene a powerful poignancy that makes up for many shortcomings earlier and later in the plot.  A wonderful and memorable moment in an otherwise rather forgettable film., and then comes up with a great line to the effect that \\"And I'm saying that, not because of the brilliance of your mind, or your precocious intellect, or because of your accomplishments, but because you're goddamned gorgeous.\\"  The fact that she is anything BUT gorgeous gives the scene a powerful poignancy that makes up for many shortcomings earlier and later in the plot.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|It took a while but this album really grew on me and is now one of my all time faves.  There is really nothing else like this.  Amazing harmony, beautiful guitar, real singing from the heart, its an album of love songs for  mature lovers, and for some reason i find it extremely sad, beautiful but oh so sad.  Like an old couple reminiscing, things that could have been, happier times.  I made a few tracks for my sister and she was blown away!
B000002N3N|5.0|This is not another lousy Celtic New Age album - it is a genuine piece of music, well written and performed with emotion. It never fails to send shivers up and down my spine for some reason... Ever since I heard Orinoco Flow Enya has cast her spell on me. She is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic. On this album every song is as perfect as it can get on a pop record, with melodies that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain. I have every Enya album to date, but this one seems to be particularly special. A must for any music lover!
0399226907|5.0|I purchased this book for my great granddaughter for her first birthday. She loves to be read to and the illustrations and story of this caterpillar actually makes her giggle. This is now her favorite book and although she is only 13 months old at this review time, she will grab up the book and crawl over to me, holding the book under her arm, and wants to have it read to her.  Eric Carle is a favorite author of my daughter who is a school teacher and I have always liked his children's books.  This is also a winner.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|SO NOW  AT LAST WE CAN SEE BLACK RAIN IN 16/9    <br />THIS MOVIE IS  VERY GOOD  AND NOT INALTERATE WITH THE TIME  SO I AM SO GLAD  TO  HAVE SEEN IT  IN 16/9   VERY GOOD SOUND  AND BEAUTIFUL PICTURE <br />SO IT WORTH THE BUYING
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is kicking it in a club. I have seen Joe in concert when he backed up Buddy Guy and this DVD does him justice. Even though it is filmed in a club, it has excellent sound quality and good cinematography. If you are a fan of Joe or the Blues I highly recommend this DVD.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I found this CD so relaxing. John Mayer is so talented and his sexy voice just puts me in a complete state of relaxation. His talent with his guitar is evident in every song, yet not overdone. My favorite song is Slow Dancing in a Burning Room. This is a great CD!

B000HEWEE4|5.0|It's rare to see a love story of 40-somethings, but Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock pull this one off with flair.  The plot has a little sci fi trick attached to it, but don't worry about that.  This is a great love story:  just enjoy.

B000HCO840|5.0|X-Men 3 is a terrific movie, full of great special effects and dramatic moments.  I highly recommend it.
B000HCO840|3.0|I see this movie as being on par with the rest of the series.  The ending was a surprise but if you want to continue a franchise that's what you have to do.  I would say that it's not a waste of money to buy and it has a fair to moderate redemption for entertainment value.
B000001FV9|4.0|as we who provide comments here should all know, what we appreciate is subjective. having said that, and having had the chance to see the original and a subsequent incarnation of traffic, blind man and feelin' good are as good as traffic ever was. this is stevie winwood's soul at it's best. if you don't dig this, fuhgeddabout it! four stars because some of the studio stuff is so so.

0156027321|5.0|I loved the book.  The survival .. It give us all hope !!
B0001CNRS4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I actually like this film, but aside from Mekhi Phifer and Joy Bryant's almost non-existent role this film is littered with some of the worst acting I've ever seen.  Jessica Alba may be beautiful but she can't act to save her life (at least she can dance) and Lil' Romeo is one of the most annoying little actors/rappers I've ever seen.  The story is sweet, even if it has been done a billion times, and the ending will make you smile but just don't expect this to be a movie you rave about.  Like I said, I like this movie, I'll watch it...but I can't defend it because as far as Hollywood fluff goes, this is at the top of the list.   <br /> <br />One of the main reasons this film falters is that it tries way to hard to be a serious film instead of embracing its mediocre generality and just being that same ol' same ol' slice of American entertainment.  By trying to add that `the hood is a hard place' statement and the `do for others not for yourself' morale they end up making this film even more ridiculous and far-fetched than it is initially.  It's entertainment, and not all entertainment has to deserve an Oscar.  This is a fun way to pass the time, and Jessica moves real nice, so sit back and enjoy the mindless entertainment but don't expect to be see anything new or improved.
B000ICM5IK|4.0|It was stirring and gets your adrenaline flowing.  Adrian had kept Rocky going in life and in death.  It took an exhibition fight so that he could finally let her rest in peace; as he said goodbye at the cemetery, he could get on with a new life and a new wife. <br /> <br />The fight (a real, violent one) in Las Vegas showed that he was still a real champion.  It was incredible as he put up a good, clean fight.  I kept rooting for him to hit low, play dirty.  A man who looks like Bruce Hartmann helped to arrange the affair with Mason Dixon, a giant of a fellow.  It was no fun to watch an old man run or cry.  The music I loved.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|`Elf' is probably one of my favorite Christmas films for its funny and sweet and original and did I mention funny yet?  I love Will Ferrell and so maybe I'm a bit bias when giving this such a high rating, but I can't help it.  I watch this movie quite a bit and every time I'm reminded of why I love it.  The story is about a young orphan who ends up a stow-away one Christmas when he slips out of his crib and slips into Santa's big bag of toys.  When Santa finds out he has a new guest he leaves baby duty up to one of the older elves (Bob Newhart) who never found love and thus never was able to have the children he wanted so badly.  When Buddy (Ferrell) gets older though he soon realizes he's not like the other elves and this sends him on a journey to find his real parents. <br /> <br />This journey leads him to Walter (James Caan), his father, a man who horrifically lands on Santa's `bad list' year after year.  The fact that Santa is all but not believed in make it difficult for anyone, including his own father, to believe Buddy, but the viewer is moved to love him more and more with each passing frame.  This is a perfect role for Will, allowing him to tone down his over the top antics (I love those too) and give us a more family friendly performance that's as funny as it is charming.  As Buddy strives to gain his fathers love and affection he must also try and resurrect the Christmas Spirit that so many have lost. With great supporting performances by Zooey Deshanel and Mary Steenburgen, `Elf' is a delightful holiday film that is sure to please the whole family!
B000GG4KTU|2.0|Her performance was not up to the high standard I have come to expect.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I was so glad to see this in DVD on Amazon.  I have had it recorded from PBS on VHS for years.  I love the movie and it's a classic for any die hard Austen fan.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|This was an excellent movie and a good end to the trilogy. Lot of action and well done special effects. Great sound
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I have watched this movie at least 1,000 times.  I simply cannot get enough.  The 2005 version was a disappointment and there simply can never be another Darcy or Elizabeth.  This is a great piece to add to your collection!  The book was wonderful and I enjoyed seeing how the characters really looked out of make-up...with the exception of Colin Firth, who always looks like his wonderful self, everyone else looked totally different.  Elizabeth(Jennifer Ehle) is a BLONDE!  I wouldn't have even recognized her.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|I'm a jazz fan. I like Diana Krall - the jazz pianist who can sing.  I have a few of her earlier cds (\\"Stepping Out\\", \\"All For You\\") when she was playing the piano more.  I sort of \\"checked out\\" of her later 'big hits' and then most definitely got back in synch with her \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" project - somewhat of a collaboration with her husband (and one of my personal favorites) Elvis Costello.  So when \\"This Moment On\\" came out, I was looking forward to more of the personal feel of \\"The Girl...\\" - but no.  Not even close.  It sounds like Diana was just fulfilling her contractual requirements with her record company on this one.  Feels like she just phoned it in.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Product was great, just as promised and LOST is never a disappointment! Cannot wait for Season 3
0792833279|4.0|This is a great movie, very very funyn, it makes you love and hate Mr Palmer al the way through the movie, too bad the sequel was a carbon copy of it. The dvd is all about the movie, no extra features, but a great price

0060930187|5.0|I've been an avid reader of Sylvia Plath's writing for quite some time. It was her works that lead me into the realm of poetry. When I discovered that she had written a book, I was beyond thrilled. It always humbles me to take an adventure through her life guided by her vivid imagery, and this book was certainly nothing short of that. <br /> <br />The Bell Jar starts at a point in her life where she is in New York apprenticing as a journalist for a magazine. It is here that her mental stability begins to decay. From that time on, the main character, Esther Greenwood, reflects on the events in her life that lead up to her condition. <br /> <br />As someone with a generally differing take on life, I appreciate this book for it's representation of the alternative mind set. This book does not come out and say that the main character is ill, they set up her depression as a chronic piece of Esther's life. The presentation of a serious mental state being shown to the world as something relatable and relatively normal is, I think, a commendable ability. With that in mind, I would recommend it to anyone who is opened to an opposing thought process, it may just change your view on life.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|One of the more inventive, original, and creative (albeit gory) horror movies in years. The thrilling suspense is also incredible. I give it an A.
B000ICLRIE|3.0|I did not enjoy the movie. The plot was poorly written and the editing was horrific. I found myself repeatedly asking what happened to the rest of a scene or why are we being shown something.  <br /> <br />The computer graphics in several scenes would make Godzilla film fans feel right at home. Many scenes could have been done in a much simpler and less grandiose way. The need to over-do action in order to show the enormity of a situation is repeated again and again in the film.  <br /> <br />I am left with thoughts of what this film could have been. I am saddened that so many think this film is a masterpiece or will give it a full allotment of stars. I am used to great films not mediocre ones worthy of such high praise.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Could have been a little more serious and realistic considering the subject matter. But overall this is a very solid film. I would recommend it.
0375714669|4.0|All of the Marjane Satrapi books, illustrated in drawings, are an excellent view of Iran as it changed with the times and its leaders. This one especially, gives a very special look into the feelings of a somewhat troubled young person. The setting and basis for Marjane's problems is rooted in her life in Iran, but as you read, you see a maturing youth experiencing great discontent with her life. She feels like a misfit. She leans toward anyone who will be her friend. She makes poor choices. She is characteristic of many young people around the world.  I would love to see this book used in highschool literature, history, and psych classes, but blunt language and social indulgences with illustrations probably make it unfit. Again, a fast read. Paragraphs of description found in other books are missing; drawings take their place.

B000006OBQ|5.0|This album has to be the jewel in the crown of Sinatra live recordings. I just wish I could have been there during these February '66 performances, the band just rocks and Sinatra's voice and demeanor never sounded better. The album is a compilation of the best song recordings during Sinatra's engagement at the Sands in Feb. '66 and the sound quality is perfect. <br />I just got this album a few weeks ago and I've been playing it at least once a week since.
1400064287|5.0|If you are going to write a guide to crafting sticky ideas, your book had better embody your principles.  Authors Chip and Dan Heath succeed admirably.  What I love about \\"Made to Stick\\" is that it is not merely entertaining (though it is), it provides practical, tangible strategies for creating sticky ideas.  Once you understand these recommendations, you can boil them down to a set of touchstone points to evaluate your own work.  This sets \\"Made to Stick\\" apart from the work of Malcolm Gladwell, whom the Heath brothers cite as an inspiration.  I enjoyed Gladwell's books but could not necessarily apply his ideas to my own work.    My review copy of \\"Made to Stick\\" is covered with highlighter.  I am reading the book once through for pure pleasure, and then I am going back again to apply the ideas to evaluate the communications of a non-profit organization I am working for.  \\"Made to Stick\\" challenges you to distill the essence of your message, to get back to core principles and to communicate them in a memorable way.  Chip and Dan point out that as we become experts, we tend to use abstraction to define our ideas, and we lose our ability to communicate with novices.  They teach us how to bridge that gap so that our ideas are once again accessible by everyone.    \\"Made to Stick\\" gives you the tools you need to revamp your own messages.  It provides \\"do it yourself\\" conuslting in book form, which will be appreciated by activists, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes.
B000HCO840|4.0|The story line was good and kept inline with the previous movies.  I'd say this was a good ending to the X-men series of movies and am looking forward to the spinoff movies these will generate.
B000FIMG68|5.0|An excellent DVD of a great show.  I loved the second season almost as much as the first season.  The characters are really interesting and they are continuing to develop more of their personalities.  The ending left the viewers with a real desire to see the third season.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Stay is a gem of a supernatural thriller that slipped into theaters in 2005 without arousing much attention.  More's the pity too, because writer/director Marc Forster has managed to create one of the best mind-benders since Jacob's Ladder.  When psychiatrist Sam (Ewen McGreggor) takes on the case of suicidal college student Henry (Ryan Gosling), Sam's world literally begins to unravel.  Disturbing dreams haunt his sleep, events inexplicably repeat themselves, dead people visit him.  Henry makes cryptic remarks that other people repeat later on in casual conversation or that appear inside of fortune cookies.  Scenes shift and change in dream-like fashion around the characters.  One room becomes another, inside becomes outside.  Past and future seem to blend, and so do Sam and Henry.  When Sam questions Henry, the camera's viewpoint remains static while the characters change position, making it appear that Sam and Henry may be the same person, that Sam is interrogating himself in Fight Club mode.  The truth - when finally revealed - is more poignant.  If all of this sounds familiar, it should.  It's all been done before.  The novelty here lies not in the story itself, but in the way the story is told, in the skillful use of camera and cutting room to create an eerie, fluid atmosphere that is the reality of dreams.

B000JVT092|5.0|I have many DVD's in my collection (over 300) and had shuddered at the notion of having to rebuy all of my movies in HD once the new format became available. This is a good middle ground for people who are thinking of upgrading their systems to HD-DVD but have yet to make the leap, or for people like me that recently got an Xbox 360 HD-DVD drive and wanted to have a movie they coould compare in both DVD as well as HD to see if all the hype is worth it. Two words: It IS!! I am in the process of buying a new HDTV so I recently brought my xbox 360/HD-DVD to my test on my mothers 52' Toshiba DLP and I must say that it was like seeing movies for the first time all over again! Absolutely stunning. The colors were amazing, the sharpness will cut your corneas, and the audio was clean and hiss free, and the extras were not only cool but accesible at anytime from the floating HD-DVD menu that can pop up whenever you want by moving down on the remote (you must see this to fully appreciate this) overall if you liked the movie you will love this disc!
B0000DIJO2|5.0|This is one of my favorite music collections. It is such a great mix of <br />Bee Gees' songs. Everytime I watch and listen to it, I feel like I've taken in an in-person concert.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of the newest Beatles release, Love, when I first heard about it. It may seem a bit opportunistic to cash in on all the Beatles mashup craze, but then again, who better than George Martin to do a Beatles mashup. A peak at the liner notes however reveals that the project came from a very different place... collaboration with the Cirque du Soleil. But, really, it's more than a mere mash-up anyway. To me, it feels more on par with the late 60's Brian Wilson \\"patchwork quilt\\" approach of aural art and avoids the novelty of the whole mash-up movement, yet it is every bit as fun and sounds fresh.<br /><br />Many of the tracks are not dramatically different from the originals. With the stereo release I'm sure people could see it as yet another repackaging of the same tunes, but the high-resolution 5.1 release opens up a new world for surround sound enthusiasts and audiophiles. I for one am ecstatic to get high-resolution 5.1 mixes of \\"I Am the Walrus\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\", \\"Come Together\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Hey Jude\\" and for goodness sake \\"A Day In The Life\\". I would have paid well over $100 for that opportunity alone, but then again, I'm a looney audio geek. Martin of course stayed true to these songs, and they just sound gorgeous in 5.1 surround. Tim Young at Metropolis Mastering is on my radar now, as this may be one of the first surround releases in the rock genre that I would truly consider of \\"reference\\" quality (Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" SACD being another strong candidate). I can definitely see myself reaching for this disc when acclimating myself with a control room for a 5.1 mix or when setting up a home theater. The stereo version was mastered by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road, and is also very good. Steve is one of my favorite engineers in the business today, so I expect no less. The stereo master isn't quite equal to the superb quality of the Yellow Submarine SONGtrack that came out a while back though. The stereo Love seems a bit reserved or over-compressed on first listen, but this could be more an issue of the new mixes. It's very difficult to compete with those original analog mixes. By the same token, it would be unfair of me to compare the high-res 5.1 master to the stereo 16 bit, but just understand that the surround is truly mind-blowing.<br /><br />Martin arranged and recorded new strings for \\"My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" at his Air Studio, but beyond that, everything is taken from actual Beatles sessions. Adding string parts to Beatles tracks is not without precedence of course (see Phil Spector's \\"Let It Be\\"). Criticism of such is not without precedence either, but this arrangement is quite tasteful and completes one of Harrison's best recordings. This project really gave license for anything, and considering all that could have been done, it might even be a little safe at times. But with material like this, I too would be loathed to change the songs drastically.<br /><br />But there are really creative combinations. \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is just stunning. Ringo's drum line from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (arguably the best drum riff ever) is perfectly suited to Harrison's trance-like drone mantra. The transition from this into \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" is really, really clever. And the subtle manipulation of the rest of \\"Lucy\\" is just awesome. I think it breathes a new liveliness and drive into the track (and maybe partly erases the memory of that awful Elton John version). I also like that, on Strawberry Fields for instance, rather than sticking strictly to tracks from the released version, Martin uses bits of the alternate/demo takes which bootleg fans have adored for years. I feel like he could have gone a little crazier at the end of \\"Strawberry Fields\\" than the extremely baroque-pop treatment the outro received. It was unexpected though, I'll give him that. It sorta Maccas-up a Lennon song to me though with that super-clean \\"Penny Lane\\" sound. By contrast, the end of \\"Mr. Kite\\" is awesome with the heavy \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" mix. It is far more appropriate treatment for a Lennon track, and it may be my favorite mashup bit of the record.<br /><br />The playful transitions between songs, which utilize a lot of the little toss-off ditties you hear on the original records, are quite nice and aid the flow of the entire album. \\"Gnik Nus\\" is eerily beautiful and indeed the kind of thing Lennon would have been all about doing. In fact, more than any of the others, I think John probably been the most excited about this kind of project with his love of sound manipulation.<br /><br />The sound quality of the surround version is an audiophile's wet dream. Well, duh. After all, the tracks are the Beatles with Martin/Emerick/Smith/Johns at the helm. The release itself is a sonic orgasm for everyone who's been clamoring for years to get high resolution mixes of anything Beatles.<br /><br />Raves aside, there are a few track that could have been better -- \\"Glass Onion\\" for instance -- or perhaps should have been eliminated completely -- like \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" which seems more like an effort to pull in the core oldies audience.  At the end of \\"Something\\", they combine \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Nowhere Man\\", and it just doesn't work. \\"Octopus's Garden\\" is terribly awkward in the intro, but ramps up well enough. It is nice to hear the \\"ahhhh\\" guitar solo break in surround finally though. This transitions with a bit of \\"Sun King\\" (forward this time) into a very cute intro of \\"Lady Madonna\\". The much reviled \\"Lady Madonna\\" has always been one of my favorite Beatles tracks (I never understood any dislike of that song), and while this mix seems to lose a little of the original's guitar power, the transition into the guitar line of Hey Bulldog is quite interesting.<br /><br />My conclusion is that this disc (particularly the surround version) is total ear candy and a lot of fun. If you are in any way inclined toward such thing, GET IT. I know it's going to be on constant rotation in our home and in our iPods for the next several months.e\\" sound.

B00005KIVN|5.0|\\"The Tango Lesson\\" is a unique and beautiful movie made by the director/ writer Sally Potter about a director/writer named Sally Potter who is fascinated by the art of Tango, meets a young dancer Pablo Ver&oacute;n (played by a dancer named Pablo Ver&oacute;n), and dances with him - and as everything Sally (well both of them) does, her dancing is graceful, elegant, delicate yet masterful, subtle, and passionate - just as the movie itself is. I don't care if it is the \\"Blatant narcissism\\", \\"Self-Indulgence or \\"Self Importance\\" - they don't make the movie for me any worse and I am fascinated by Sally Potter, the strong, talented, and independent woman.<br /><br />\\"The Tango Lesson\\" examines the mysterious connection between two people, their interest to each other, even if they were not meant to be together. At one point, Sally tells Pablo, \\"It doesn't suit me to follow. It suits me to lead, and you can't deal with that.\\" The film is also about sensual passion of Tango where every dance is a fight between the partners over the control and victory and both victory and defeat are a celebration.
0393061434|5.0|iWoz is a fun and interesting read about the life of Steve Wozniak.  His tales provide a great insight into how his mind works, his ideals and beliefs, what drives him and how he was brought up.  This background gives the reader a good understanding about how Woz came to be who he is and how he did what he did. <br /> <br />There is quite a bit of overlap between this book and his biography by Martha E. Kendall (ISBN 0-945783-08-6) but that is to be expected.  The tales are entertaining, inspiring, and in many cases simply amazing.  Readers somewhat already familiar with Woz will know what a great prankster he is and the book certainly reflects this.  He talks about some of his best pranks that he was able to pull off, as well as others that didn't quite go as planned. <br /> <br />By the time you've finished reading the book it's as if you've just interviewed the man himself, and you get a good idea of what he is really like.  And whilst some may think he's done some crazy things, as the \\"Think Different\\" Apple television commercial says, \\"because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do\\".
0743238257|5.0|Very difficult \\"read\\" , but very intuitive , but I believe this is not your typical \\"self-help\\" book for the everyday layman like myself included . I believe a background in sociology , or studious , serious \\"mind\\" explorers would like this book . It is a relative fast read , but I had trouble retaining from one day to the next as I believe much of the learning material was difficult . For serious readers only , save your money & watch \\"Oprah\\" as I believe one of her shows could help you in life mush easier then this excellent book . I know this sounds contradictory , but it's actually almost spelled out in this book this way.................
B000LC55F2|4.0|An above average movie. Very nice plot, although i doubt with seeing it one time that everything is completely clear... <br /> <br />Movie is about two men who are magicians. One of them is married to a woman who dies during one of the acts. The man claims that his partner might have been involved. So, the movie carries on with these two men trying to outdo the other in magic and getting revenge. <br /> <br />You have to pay really close attention to what is going on, as it is very easy to get lost in the plot. It goes back and forth from past to future. Good acting. A good story. Nicely done. <br /> <br />However, i would have to see it a couple of times more to completely understand it. It is very difficult to know the motives for each scene. The language was a bit hard to understand at times too. <br /> <br />An overall good movie. Recommended.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie appears to be so real and moving that it is hard to watch it all at once. I have never been so emotoinally rivetted than I had in this movie. The subject of my Lord is so near and dear to my heart that at times it just made me mad to see to inhumane treament he received. James Caviezel, was so convincing, I was brought to tears even sobing at times. Thank you for your portrail of the Greatest Story ever told.
B000HCO840|3.0|You can definitely tell there was a change in directors between X2 and X3, but maybe it wasn't the change in direction so much as it was just a really bad script.  Such as... can somebody please explain to me what happened to Nightcrawler between X2 and X3?  No Gambit... for some strange reason, even though he's one of the more popular characters.  The movie was also really short... it could've had an extra ten or twenty minutes added onto it.  Bad writing and a different director make this movie less than the spectacular film that it was hyped to be. <br /> <br />Now, that's not saying it's a bad movie, because it isn't.  There's lots of great story and special effect shots.  But... this is more Wolverine's movie than it is a movie about all of the X-Men.  Anyways, it's just good enough.  You know you're gonna get it anyways.  The comic book that is included with it is pretty cool, too.  Just get it... you won't be disappointed, but you probably will be left wondering why there isn't more than there is.
B00068TJM6|4.0|Pros: <br />- It is very good watch and got lot of features. <br />- The price offered by amazon is very attractive when I bought it. 130 bugs is a good deal for this watch <br />Cons: <br />- Bit bulky and heavy.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I love the first CD. I find that this is the only one that I play.  The 2nd one is good but I only listen to about 3 tracks on it.  I could have just bought the one and been happy with that.
0143034901|5.0|this book was interesting, not predictable, compelling and spell binding. i loved every page of it and fit mass amounts of time in my busy college schedule to read it rapidly. i have already recommended it highly to all my friends and i can't wait for them to finish reading about it so we can discuss it.
B000007492|4.0|Excellent collection of an often overlooked band. If you like their music, you will not be disappointed. Even my children love this CD
B000HCO840|5.0|This is by far the best X-Men yet!!! I love the graphics, characters and story line... So Amazing!!! This is a must own!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although it may not have million dollar special effects, it has awesome character development and a storyline. I just can't help but feel attached to the characters.
B000002IO1|5.0|Sung by an excellent blues singer.  Allana has an authenticity to her voice that makes her a true blues singer.  I especially enjoy the classic \\"Black Velvet\\" which is the reason I purchased the CD.
B00003W8NM|5.0|If you are a fan of this movie and you like to listen to commentaries, you will definitely appreciate this one.  Brad Pitt reveals his intelligent side as he discusses how he prepared for the role.  David Fincher is also good.  Edward Norton comes across a little egocentric, but entertaining none the less.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I'm so glad they re-released The Little Mermaid.  My old VHS copy was getting pretty worn out from the repeated plays my daughter put it through. <br />All the little extras were a lot of fun to watch as well. <br />
0739308742|5.0|I had read reviews that this book did not adequately advance the plot of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. I do not agree with that characterization at all. This was a very satisfying and interesting addition to the series. I can't wait for the \\"other half\\" of this too large book to be issued by Martin. What a story!!!
B00092ZL80|5.0|Found out about dvd through a PBS special where they showed the best portions of the dvd. Both bands start out together for a couple of songs & then Earth,Wind, & Fire plays 12 alone; then Chicago 12 or so alone and depending on which group you are into is the one you'll like best and they don't disappoint. Chicago was my right arm for music back then so Earth, Wind, & Fire seemed dated to me yet I enjoyed them BUT then they come together for about 6 songs and it's AMAZING! Together they challenge each others talents like \\"Dueling Banjos\\" & you realize that you missed out on a very special once in a life time concert...so glad they put it on dvd.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|As a guy raised on the Beatles, I was a little pessimistic about this album. The one thing, well 2 things actually that kept me excited about it anyway is that (1) it's the soundtrack for a Cirque Du Soleil and (2) the project was in the hands of George Martin \\"the fifth beatle\\".  <br /> <br />I've been a long time fan of Cirque Du Soleil. This album truly matches the beauty of what a Cirque show is. For those who don't know, Love is the title of a new Beatles themed Cirque Du Soleil running in Vegas that is set to Beatles music, specifically: this album. <br /> <br />This is by no means a greatest hits collection which makes me all the more happier. They picked songs that go together perfectly and create one big rock opera. It's a gorgeous CD. Parts of songs are found in parts of other songs, little is added to the original songs except for an orchestra in \\"while my guitar gently weeps\\". Everything else, while it may sound new and different to you is actually previously recorded Beatles music. Just rearranged.  <br /> <br />Take whatever bias you have out and get this CD. You can't imagine how good this CD is until you actually hear it. As soon as it was over, I was ready for the next listen...and ready to see the show!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban is one of the few artists that both my 3 year old daughter and I agree on. We both love his music! I played his earlier CD a lot when I was pregnant with her, and then my husband got me this CD. I am very happy with both CDs. His voice is so soothing, and he does a nice variety of songs. What an amazing talent for such a young kid.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|If you love Austin Powers, you must buy the 3 together, it's a great deal, and you get 3 great movies! I loved the first one, with it's oftentimes less than tasteful humor, the 2nd one I do not care for so much as the humor is so dirty sometimes, it fails to be funny. And then the 3rd one is just as good - if not better - than the 1st. It expertly combines the raucous humor from the 2nd movie, with the more classic humor of the first. Jokes are constantly reused and recycled in new ways through each movie, but they never get old, an each new version can make you laugh harder than the last! Also, Mike Meyers certainly proves his acting skills by taking on a multitude of roles. All in all, it's a great buy, and you can't watch just one, so you may as well get all three! Whenever you have a bad day, pop Austin Powers in, and you'll soon forget your worries amidst the fabulous humor that Austin Powers is all about.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I have always liked the music from this musical and this video is giving an excellent well filmed presentation of the whole performance.
0743289412|4.0|Lisey's story is a love story with a King twist.  An author's widow is faced with the task of cleaning up her late husband, Scott's, study.  While taking this on she is faced with: her past, her husband's past, a stalker and a sick sibling.  In great King fashion we have the ever present supernatural aspect in his novels with Scott's special place, Boo'ya Moon.  <br /> <br />I thought this was a wonderful novel that I truly enjoyed.  I have read many of King's works and although this differs from many it was one of my favorites.  It didnt so much make me jump out of my seat scared, but rather made me think of a great love, a great relationship, a haunted past and a special place.
B000ICL3KG|3.0|AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is a compelling documentary about the dangers of global warming, brought to us by world-renowned climatologist/oceanographer Albert Gore, Jr.<br /><br />Wait a minute. . .<br /><br />AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH explores the perils of global warming's disastrous effects on the earth's ecosystems by internationally-acclaimed micro-biologist Albert Gore, Jr.<br /><br />Plop. . .<br /><br />Fact of the matter is, director Davis Guggenheim has made a documentary on a subject that screams for our immediate attention, but then selects a messenger who--although extremely committed to environmental issues--lacks credibility when Gore, the self-proclaimed inventor of the Internet, attempts to connect to the public at large.  And that's a shame, as global warming needs to be center stage of our international lexicon, and it's painfully obvious the current administration chooses to ignore it.  Unfortunately, Guggenheim's message rings hollow when coming from a limousine liberal.<br /><br />So here's the problem with AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH:  Vital subject, wrong messenger.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING
B000H7JD4K|3.0|Like most of the people interested in this CD, I'm an old maiden fan. The CD is pretty good, in that many songs show that Maiden still has some creative ability. I saw the associated tour, and I think they played the entire CD. I really wanted to hear at least some old stuff. I felt like I paid $60 and drove 50 miles just to hear 'Hallowed be thy name.' I don't understand why bands treat their fans like that.
B000GFLE86|5.0|This album is excellent! The best ones on this are I'm All Right, California Rain and Blue Alert. I can recommend to every one who likes good, smooth jazz! Madeleine has a beautiful, silky voice. Get it, don't think! :)
B000HCO83Q|5.0|EXCELENT!!!!!!The Last Stand It is a masterpiece!!!, ....with more mutants and more action, it is a very good end for the saga of the x-men, I hope that there is one more. <br />And they, ... they will return???? <br />La Recomiendo
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Modern Times, as you go thru this cd you begin to feel a little nostalgic, the guitars are electric now but the writing is by far the best in a few years, listen and learn, this poet speaks of life. <br />br
B00005JNS0|4.0|A very cute movie that appeals to all ages. I took my 3 year old son to see it in the theater & knew we would have to buy a copy. My husband & 2 year old both enjoyed it on DVD. The romance between the 2 cars runs a little long for preschoolers but all in all a fun movie.
B00027JZ3E|4.0|This is one of the best Teen Vampire movies ever made. <br />Film makers now a days should take a page from this book and make more movie's like this one. It has a family coming together to fight for each other in very strange situations. I would hope my family would do the same if they were ever in a situation at all like the ones this family has gotten into. The extras with the two Cory's was very interesting . I believe this is one movie that every one should  see at least once. Every movie buff should have a copy of this in their collection.
6305428042|4.0|My kids love this movie. It's a great dvd to have in your collection.
B000059H98|5.0|GREAT!!!!  I think Lorie Petty is a great Actress that is so under appreciated and under utilized . She is a really good actress . I would love to see her in more films. This movie is so different from any movie I have ever seen, I loved it .  <br />Not only does it entertain but it also has a message, well really more than one message. If you appreciate movies that are different and not the same old cookie cutter movie than this one is for you! It is original, It is funny , serious , stupid and crazy but when you put it altogether you get a great Sci-Fi   movie with a lot of heart. If you have never seen this movie you really should! <br /> I can't say enough about this movie with out telling you about it.  Just take a look at the cover art and you will get the idea.  I really had to hunt to find this movie on DVD and I'm so glad I did. Enjoy
B000GFLE86|5.0|This is a great album. First note to last.  You'll put it on repeat and leave it on all day.
B000ASATYO|5.0|This has got to be the best Michael J. Fox movie I have ever seen (and I love M.J.Fox) . <br />This movie has it all, Scares!Laughs! Romance! <br />The Ghost are great. <br />I could watch this movie every day. <br />I watch alot of movies and I own alot of them. <br />This is one of the few that I have on both VHS & DVD. <br />I have the original and the Directors cut. <br />The extras are great.  <br />If you like Michael J. Fox movie's you will love this one, <br /> Even if you don't like his movies this is a must see for Horror fans and Comedy lovers a like. Enjoy!!! <br />
0143036556|5.0|A fascinating and scary collection of stories about rise and fall of civilizations. Although it might have used a little more editing, it keeps one's attention riveted. It should be required reading for President Bush as well as other world leaders and candidates for leadership roles.
1594200823|5.0|I really liked this book - the writing is just excelent - humorous and intellegent.  It was obvious to me that Michael exeprienced an amazing journey in developing this work.  It is enjoyable and entertaining to read, and hard to put down.  But, it is also a distrubing account of the state of affairs of our US food supply, but also not without hope.  It will definitely open eyes and help to understand the personal impact we have on the environment, and what we as consumers can do to address it.
0060922583|5.0|Michael Talbot's book makes otherwise difficult concepts easy to understand. It's a pleasurable reading and I could not put it down. I highly recommend reading it!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I don't know if any of you heard the hoopla that was going around about this film, or even if you heard of it at all, but here it is in a nutshell:  John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) wanted to make a movie that doesn't turn sex into a dirty thing but at the same time doesn't hide sex either.  The big controversy over Shortbus is the fact that it definitely does NOT hide the sex.  It's all there in it's full glory with full penetration and everything...even an orgy or two. <br /> <br />Now that that's out of the way...Shortbus is not a porn movie.  It's not even one of those high class Michael Lucas porn movies that have stories in between all the sex. <br /> <br />What it is is a story about a handful of people who meet each other and who are all broken in some way.  The sex therapist who has never had an orgasm.  The former hustler who thinks he's only worth what people paid for him.  The dominatrix who longs to be an artist and live in a house. <br /> <br />They all meet and revolve around each other in a search for themselves.  And it's a fun movie and frank and open and it celebrates life and sex and living... <br /> <br />I'm torn about the actual sex in the movie, however.  I think the movie would've been just as effective--and much more palatable to the wide audience that it deserves--without the full on sex but at the same time the sex was part of the story and woven into it so well that you really don't think about it.  You're certainly not going to be getting off to it even with the full on penetration and fellatio and rimming--including one hilarious scene where three characters are having sex and they all start singing the Star Spangled Banner...one of them singing the song into the posterior of one of the others!--and S&M, etc. <br /> <br />Regardless of that I honestly think this was an incredible film.  When it was over I felt good and I can't say that about many movies. <br /> <br />If you're open minded and not put off by people having actual sex in a non pornographic film definitely check Shortbus out.  It was an amazing film and definitely worth watching.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|I now have all three versions of this story.  I prefer the 1933 original <br />version.  The last release was OK, but I felt overwelmed by the CGI stuff. <br />The 1976 version just did not produce. The original, projected the terror <br />and the love intrest of Kong. <br /> <br />Michael
0142004413|3.0|The book was disappointing to me simply because I had enjoyed the video as shown on PBS.  The book is full of scientific names of animals, insects, etc., that if I hadn't had a visual from the video in my mind of the characters, I would not have hung in there to the last page.
0743298020|5.0|This is a satisfying mystery, lots of mood setting, not so much a thriller but a psychological insight as it unfolds.

B0000025DV|5.0|ELO evolved for many years before this recording came out. They then hung around for several years after this one. In all of the earlier recordings you can hear all the pieces coming togerther. In the later ones, you can hear the group slowly disolving. Luckily this particular recording is of such high quality that ELO has left a great legacy for their fans and fans of progressive rock (used in its literal sense). Out Of The Blue initially was released on vinyl as a double album but has been condensed to a single CD for today's format. Jeff Lynne did a wonderful job putting together this futuristic sounding concept album. The whole band have their highlights on this recording. From Lynne's vocals and slick production skills to fantastic drums, keyboards and strings. If you are looking to get one ELO album to represent the best they had to offer, this is the one to get hold of. <br />Jeff Lynne produced several memorable recordings even after ELO broke up so his influence can be heard in several different ways (George Harrison, The Traveling Wilbury's, etc.). <br />Everyone's basic library should include this disc.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This movie is an uninspired retelling of the Beowulf and Grendel tale.  There are added characters that bring you no closer to an understanding of the story, an added back story that is supposed to explain Grendel's rage and added violence that does not better explain Grendel in any manner.  Avoid this version of the tale unless you like to look at lovely scenery and watch people running around in furs.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I love every single song on this album. I didn't know how they could top their previous effort, but dag. I recommend this to anyone who likes rock and just plain old good songwriting.
0375505091|1.0|Annie Lebowitz was what was happening in photography twenty or thirty years ago. Now she is a pseudo establishment hack (see her recent collaberation with Disney if you doubt this).<br /><br />She is paid to produce commercial photos with an Annie Lebowitz patina which apparently still has some commercial cache with Vogue and other dying retail print platforms.<br /><br />This collection of photos have a emotional range that starts with the incredibly self-indulgent and tapers off into her now hackneyed commercial style.<br /><br />If you want to see some photography with artistic integrity I would suggest a copy of Apeture.
032147404X|5.0|The Digital Photography Book by Scott Kelby has a great deal of  suggestions to help improve your photo taking skills.  It is easy to follow and would be as asset no matter what brand of camera you are using.  I am never disappointed with a book written by Scott Kelby.  He also writes Photoshop books that are awesome.  His books have been invaluable to me.
0618164413|5.0|This book has every story written by the original Curious George creators, the Reys. There are other stories available besides these, but they were not written by the Reys. Will bring back warm memories of your childhood. I have bought this for three people as a baby shower gift since I am not very good at estimating sizes of baby clothing, and everyone has loved it.
B000BCKFWK|3.0|I remember absolute being in awe at how Rodriguez brought Frank Miller's graphic novel to screen. I was particularly pleased with seeing some of my favorite actors in definitively different roles. However, this is better to rent than to buy unless you really loved the movie. It does make me excited to see how Miller's other graphic novel, 300, will translate to screen. I think they did a better job on that trailer than this one.
B000274THQ|5.0|one of my best movies<br /><br />great plot<br /><br />great place : berlin<br /><br />beautiful music :(
1594481938|5.0|This was by far the best book I've ever read. I cried, I laughed, and, most importantly, I fell in love with everyone of the characters. Everything was developed so well, I didnt doubt any of it for a second. It was very entertaining, as well as deep at the same time. A great novel!
B000EHSVQE|5.0|Personally, I LOVE this movie.  I thought it was hilarious.  I don't think it was the intention of the creators to produce a Cannes Film Festival classic or blockbuster laugh-riot hit for the masses, but to bring forth humor in a dry and quirky way for people who \\"get\\" this type of humor.  The shallow storyline is, in itself, part of the humor.  It's off the beaten path but not so far out there that it's offensive.  There are LOTS of extras on this DVD and I enjoyed all of it.
0743298020|4.0|Loved this book. It was a good old gothic mystery with interesting surprises along the way. There is one kind of slow part in the middle that perhaps went on longer than necessary (regarding the governess for the children)- but this really is the only real flaw.  I recommend it highly!
0060977493|2.0|Wow.  I don't feel like reading this book was a complete waste of my time, thus the two stars, but it was pretty darn close.  I read the book for my book club and everyone in the group felt the same way.  I found it to be extremely wordy...too wordy.  It was as if she was just writing to fill pages at times.  She overdescribed most everything to the point of obnoxiousness.  The story is interesting, and different for sure, but confusing at times as the extreme wordiness takes over.  Had she just told the story, I'd probably feel differently. My book club was left wondering, where was her editor?

B000FIMG68|5.0|What a way to go back over the season and see all the small details missed during the season.  Just a good as it was the first time!  Now I have my husband hooked, who can't watch it during the season because he works nights!  We both can't wait until Season 3 comes out on DVD.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Is a fantastic piece of work! Every song has its meaning and funnily resembles one (or more) of their older CD tracks...although Evanescence always write about pain and heartbreak...this one is easier for ppl (and me) to relate to. Basically most of the songs refer to \\"you only call me when you're sober\\" or \\"what do you want with me now...you're the one who left\\" these aren't quotes of the songs, but rather what the songs \\"mean\\".<br /><br />Anyway...i wouldn't change it much...except the cd cover...not too practical!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I love this album. I always listen to it in the car. Her songs make me happy. It's an excellent first album.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|I can't think of a more descriptive word for this CD than FUN. This is a total fire-up, put on before you go out CD. It makes me want to dance, dance, dance and party all night long.
B000HA4W4S|3.0|I thought their first record was fantastic and found myself playing it a lot. This album is kinda more of the same but certainly not as brilliant as the first. Dont find myself wanting to keep going back to it. Its a little dull asides from a couple of tracks.
B00005JNTX|5.0|A must see movie. Completely different then the rest. A nice change for once. Lots of action.
B000F0UV0E|2.0|I bought this CD without listening to any tracks, just by my love of the two musicians, but was very disappointed.  I have been a Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan since the beginning. I always see him live whenever he passes through town, but I have to say this CD was very disappointing. The songs are slow and unmemorable and although the two voices are a nice mix, the material doesn't do them justice. The CD is lacking any of the great guitar leads that make Mark Knopfler unique.  I wish I had listening to this one before I purchased.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Travolta and Mrs Berry. Thats all you should need to know. If your in to computers this is a must see.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I have eagerly been anticipating the release of this Academy Awarding winning  movie on DVD for years and I have not been disappointed. This is a classic American film and still holds up after all these years. The performances by Warren Beatty and the rest of the cast are superb and this is a great history lesson for anyone who wants to see a snapshot of the world during the time of the Russian Revolution. It is the perfect mix of biography, romance and history and I recommend it to all film enthusiasts as well as Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton fans.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|For its time, well way ahead of it's time. Robots, energy weapons,aliens,all rolled into one, and the graphics aren't bad at all! <br />I'm sure some of the scifi writers used this as an starting platform. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! <br />A must for any serious scifi buff!
B000069HZP|5.0|<br /> <br />Many of you, if not most, will think you do not find this review \\"helpful\\" - but, if you heed my advice, you will.  <br /> <br />Before you watch this movie read \\"Busting Loose From the Money Game\\" by Robert Scheinfeld. If you do that you will watch this movie with a whole new set of eyes. You'll recognize yourself in Van Orton, playing the \\"Game\\", acquiring valuable possessions you CAN take with you (such as compassion and understanding), while caught on a seemingly out-of-control ride that, in the end, you are reminded that you asked for.  <br /> <br />A thriller I will watch again and again, over the years... especially when my own game appears overwhelming.
B00008QSA5|2.0|I first bought this album when I was about 17, I'm now 52 and I love it now as much as I did then. It is one of those magical mixes that don't happen very often. Like \\" Hotel California\\" by The Eagles with Joe Walsh, or Santana Abraxas.
0743298020|4.0|The Thirteenth Tale was a surprise to me in that it held my attention throughout the book.  The author's ability to hold your attention while building up the suspense to create a surprise ending was great.  I have to admit when it arrived and I read the \\"jacket info\\" I was hesitant to start reading it.  But, I'm so happy that I did and I have passed the book on and other readers agree with me.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Even if you don't like Martial Arts genre films, this movie is the one to see! A young man and his sidekick want to be gangsters. A landlady and landlord want to run their community in peace and QUIET! And, The Ax Gang wants to be Best Dressed. Practically every form of martial arts, known and unknown, is represented in the film. The movie is consistently funny, including the \\"Looney Tunes\\" action sequences. Kung Fu Hustle is over the top, a spoof and fun to watch.
1931559317|2.0|I bought this for my husband at Christmas because we like to stargaze (casually) and wanted something with basic instruction.  This book is for somebody who is serious about astronomy - not a casual binocular stargazer.
B000F7CMRW|2.0|I found it interesting, but was tempted to turn it off several times. My 19 year-old daughter fell asleep, and my wife went to bed. I did watch the whole thing, but if I wasn't interested in the subject, I wouldn't have. <br /> <br />
0739334085|5.0|I've been listening to politicians for a lot of years and have long been of the belief that if you can hear them speak you know they are lying. In this book, Mr. Obama comes across as a decided middle of the roader, as I like to think I am myself.  <br /> <br />If he should seriously run for President, he has to first convince the Democratic party to make him their candidate. That means primaries. And in primaries the extreme left wing of the party is in control. It will be interesting to see what he says to convince them to select him rather than Hillary, John Edwards, Kerry, et al. Does he turn far left, does he continue the understanding that he shows in this book towards say the pro-life people, the ones who aren't saying 'get out of Iraq immediately.'  <br /> <br />This book/tape almost sounds like something that an ex-president might write after he is no longer concerned with running for office. If indeed he can keep this books attitude, while competing in the real world of high-stakes politics he just might be a pretty good candidate after all.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is one of the Best movies. If you are ever down in the dumps or crossed in love this movie is definitley a must watch. Pride and Predjudice is one of my very favorite movies. I would recommend this to any one.
B000002J03|5.0|You don't need me to tell you how good this album is; you've heard it. The CD firmat brings out all the great sounds you heard in the '60s.
0618680004|1.0|American Heritage Dictionary:  Religion; A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.  <br /> <br />Is it just me - or does that make Atheism Mr. Dawkin's religion? <br />Just a thought for all your \\"converts\\" :)
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This joint effort is likely to put a huge smile on the face of anyone who enjoys listening to either of these two sensational artists. Mark and Emmylou have produced a multi-faceted and highly lyrical CD; there is all kinds of variety and styles and a warm, rich vocal quality accompanied by wonderful instrumental gems of expression.  This is one of the best albums I've listened to in some time!!  Do not miss this special treat!!!
B000A2H812|4.0|I had never actually heard of Gogol Bordello until I read a review in a magazine about them. I decided to check them out because the idea of Gypsy Punk intrigued me. I'm usually up for any type of music so I didn't hesitate to try them out. I was glad I did. The music is all so infectious that it's hard not to like them. Song after song I never grew tired of the unique blend of all the ingredients that make this album something you wont come upon very often in life.
1573301183|5.0|This is a very well recorded DVD that demonstrates the greatness of Alice in Chains. I watched it on a Naim system running totem speakers and was very impressed with the performance as well as the recording. My fav. song would be sludge factory. But I was very surprised that they stopped on the first take! I would recommend this DVD to anyone, but must warn that the music is quite dark at times.
0517147688|5.0|I personally love all of Austen's works so when I saw that they were all compiled together in this book and at such a great price I could not let the opportunity slip away. My personal favorite novel is Pride and Prejudice which along with Sense and Sensibility and Emma are some of her most famous works having been made into movies as well. However nothing is better than the novels themselves. As a young woman I cant say I can exactly relate to the characters in Austen's novels but I feel a connection with them because I am a young woman. Her novels depict a glimpse into the world of the young women of her time and though we live in very different times now, there are certain feelings that reamin exactly the same. I difinetly recommend all of these novels to any young woman out there because each of the protagonists in these novels is a heorine in her own right even if at times we find they are greatly flawed. It is their flaws that make them so human. This is a great collection to give a daughter or a niece or any young female in your life because it is something that was written by an intelligent woman about intellegant women.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|No need to go to the esplanade in Boston on the forth of July. Just watch Cozy play the 1812th. Combined with Ronnie's powerful voice and stage theatrical style, Ritchie's expressions and \\"no need to say\\" on stage presence, you have the best you can get.  They just don't make live rock shows like this anymore. If your a Rainbow/Blackmore/Dio fan, you will not be dissapointed. I would have paid two or three times more for this dvd.                 enjoy!
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|3.75/5 stars  I am an amateur Incubus fan, and I just really got into them. I loved SCIENCE, Make Yourself, and Morning View. But not so much Crow Left of a Murder. Light Grenades in my opinion is better than Crow Left of the Murder, but nevertheless falls short of the previous three albums. Despite previous reviews, I liked Earth to Bella Part 1, however it does become a bit redundant. But the tracks like Dig and Anna Molly are my favorites. Not as hard as their earlier works, I still find it a worthwhile album to listen to. Love Hurts also grew on me, but stay away from Part 2 of Earth to Bella and Quicksand. The rest seem to have some potential. Rogues kinda grew on me...    Of course it depends on the fan. Sample it a bit and then make your decision.     My Good Song List: (not quite in order)  1. Anna Molly  2. Dig  3. Love Hurts  4. Earth To Bella (part 1 ONLY)  5. Rogues  6. Pendelous Threads    Beware! Bad Songs:  1. Quicksand  2. Part 2 Earth to Bella  3. Oil and Water
0792844890|5.0|I am a Mel Brooks fan to begin with, so he can do no wrong as far as I am concerned.  There are so many hidden double entendres, you have to see it several times to catch all of them... as with all Brooks' movies.  I do not like science fiction, so I may be missing many of the jabs regarding Star Wars, but I love this movie just the same.  Spaceballs is my fourth favorite of the Brooks' films.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Great dvd, amazing virtuosicness. :-P The DVD is worth getting from any Dream Theater fan, and if you have never heard of them, GET IT! THEY ARE THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD! (really their musicianship out plays most guys.)
B000006OHL|5.0|There is something fascinating and still very haunting about this music.  The main theme, with such a simple theme of just two notes, is barely music and almost absurd in its base form, but given the pacing, dynamics and subtle orchestration, it becomes gold.  In its understated and twisted beauty, if you could even call it that, this is more horrifying than the theme from Psycho, for example.  The theme from Taxi Driver is ethereal and subsconscious, rather than in your face.  There is great influence of jazz in the score and Miles Davis certainly comes to mind.<br /><br />For example, listen to \\"Thank God for the Rain\\": the music literally inhales and exhales; there is a sublime, constant tension that is never quite resolved.  It matches the film and the stressed mind of main character of Travis Bickle perfectly.<br /><br />It is not without reason that the producers of Taxi Driver, and Martin Scorsese, honored \\"friend\\" Bernard Herrmann in the credits by dedicating the film in his memory.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the final tracks (those not scored by Herrmann) sound horrible in comparison.  They sound very '70's', which is appropriate for the film and the time, but very dated and not fitting the intense, gritty mood of the film at all.  It shows how differently the same material can be handled by two opposing minds, and how drastic the contrast can be.  Still, this does not detract from the release, since they are all placed at the end of the CD, so they are easy to skip without hassle.
0375405380|5.0|Don Winslow has been my favorite fiction author since I began reading as an adult (i.e., not assigned), and he has not disappointed me with this book.  Unlike The Death and Life of Bobby Z. and California Fire & Life, The Power of the Dog takes a little more than the first five pages to pull a reader in, but it has wonderul character development, intensity that kept me turning pages, and one of the most brutal chapters of fiction I have ever read.<br /><br />The story follows the career of DEA Agent and former CIA operative in Vietnam Art Keller.  Keller's career with the DEA was made by a Mexican police officer, Tio Barrea, who later became a drug kingpin in Mexico, thanks largely and unknowingly to Keller eliminating his competition through his work with the DEA.  When Kelly discovers how Tio has manipulated their relationship, he dedicates the rest of his career to bringing Tio down, at a huge cost to his personal and professional lives, and to the lives of those around him.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|i loved this cd so much i bought a copy for my hubby.
0440224764|3.0|I really don't get into a lot of John Grisham's novels.  Mainly because the story's are all the same. Southern lawyer, freash and new, attempts to overcome an evil group either a business or other law professionals.  So i took a chance with The Partner.  Is it believable that one guy, who changed so much physically, that could learn espeonage, a foreign language, wiring money around foreign banks, and come up with the perfect way to fake his own death, plus steal $90 million and get away with it with no real charges?  Plus the ending i saw it coming halfway through.  And that really pissed me off.  Mainly because for all that he did and learn and do, it didn't amount to much at the end.  Especially when i was rooting for him to get away to his new life.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|much better image quality and fine extras.  this is a magical film and an expression of all that is possible in cinema.  you can see the significant and substantial influence of Ford and you will realize why Kurosawa was always considered the most Western of Japanese auteurs after studying this film.  this nearly four hour epic never wanes in its excitement, tension, and anticipation.  perhaps the greatest action film of all time and definitely one of the top 20 films.
140003180X|4.0|I enjoy this series of books - the writing is picturesque. I find myself comfortably transported into a world that I know nothing about. No serious issues in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series - just fun, light reading.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|This is by far the funniest movie ever made. Robert Stack looks all of seventeen. Jack Benny is young, but already has all the timing and mannerisms we saw in the early days of TV on the Jack Benny show. Carole Lombard (this is the last movie she ever made--she died in a plane crash soon after)is a comedic genius at the height of her talent. Listen carefully. You won't want to miss a single hilarious line.

6305922756|4.0|This rockumentary is dead on.  It pokes fun at all the rock and roll cliches.  Great to put on at a party.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Lots of the Greatest Guitar artists, Rock, Blues, Country. <br />Found this set to be great entertainment. <br />A welcome addition to the library.
B00002SWEM|4.0|Great dvd if you're intrested in learning the stories of the musicians behind the record.<br /><br />highly recomend it for all die hard music lovers.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Someday Fox will realize that they had the greatest television show ever produced in it's hands and they let it get away.  The characters, the writing, the story, the 'verse itself are all top notch.  I hope to God one day this series gets another shot at life.  Whoever it was that decided to axe this show should have his fingertips fed to wolverines.  Do your self a favor buy this DVD set, watch it, try not to cry that it's over, and loan it to someone else and let them experience how amazing this show is.
B00003CXDV|4.0|I appreciated and enjoyed this more today than when it first came out.<br /><br />A real hoot!
0307276902|4.0|To me it does not matter if its a true story or all made up. It was still a good book. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to read a good book.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I Loved it!!! <br />It tied up all the loose ends from the \\"Firefly\\" series and yet would stand on its own as a good movie.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I find that all her exercise videos are very well done and they encourage you to keep fit. <br />The routines are not easy but \\"doable\\" <br />I am 61 and will not use anyother DVD than this one. <br />I do the two routines in sequence one each time every other day. <br />I love the \\"no-guilt\\" ten minute quicky at the end, I do it on weekends. It has saved my self esteem many a time.
B000002UB3|5.0|Goodbye Beatles.<br /><br />The last and best Beatles album, ABBEY ROAD, was a fitting cap to a stellar career for four lads from Liverpool, the likes of which will never be seen again.<br /><br />Recorded after the LET IT BE sessions but released prior, this record was a gift for all of us, and for all time. Discover the greatest rock band of the 20th Century, or relive the miracle that emanated from the studios at Abbey Road.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation!
0738702994|5.0|I had seen scans of this deck online and was instantly captivated. By chance I saw it at a store in town and picked it up. I was blown away when I looked through the deck! Any scans cannot do this deck justice. The cards are just breathtaking. I think the Death, the Lovers and the Moon are some of the most striking of any I have ever seen.  <br /> <br />It is true the minors are in a less grandiose style, but the reasoning is sound as to why she chose to draw them that way. And they are no less magical and shining for that. The history, myth and love of Wales and the Welsh is embedded within this deck on a profound level. It is what drew me to to the deck in the 1st place, and I most certainly wasn't disappointed! Quite the opposite, loved it more than I thought I would.  <br /> <br />The book is a wonderful addition. The major aracana cards each has a myth tied to it.....some of them in very clever and new way to look at the trumps. With so many tarot decks coming out these days, most are just not up to par. Put together quickly to turn a buck. This deck and book was obviously fashioned and designed with love and care. You won't be disappointed!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Been a Republican, I would vote for Al Gore for President based on his views of our World Ecology today, far more dangerous than all the radicals put together.
0061122416|5.0|Yes.  It sounds ridiculous when you hear someone say \\"this book changed my life.\\"  Especially when it is so small and so simple.  But the truth is that, regardless of page counts, this book did in fact change my life.  Or, should I say, it didn't \\"change\\" it...my life is as it always has been...but rather it brushed the fog and cobwebs from my eyes and woke me so that I could see it clearly for the first time in ages.  This book doesn't teach us anything new, but it instead gently reminds us of what we've forgotten.  Everyone knows the secrets that Paulo Coelho speaks of.  We all know the answers.  We've just misplaced them in our busy lives.  Just read it.  Then devour the rest of his books and I promise you'll discover a depth to even the most average of souls and lives.  As for those reviews who just think \\"hey, cute story.\\" - I'm a believer in signs and fates and divine intuition/influence...I've struggled with faith, as we all have, but I'm convinced that as of this point, you didn't need the book.  But sooner or later, the book will have it's position/place in your world and a very profound impact on you.  Just wait and see.  I've given this book to many as gifts.  Many said \\"ooh...so what?\\" one day, and then a year later, they call me up, their voice pale with disbelief saying \\"why didn't i see it before?\\"
B000GGSMB2|5.0|I've seen Scarface a million times by now, I practically have the movie memorized. I saw it on VHS, the limited edition DVD, and the anniversary DVD. When the Platinum edition was set to be released, I thought the people releasing it were just trying to make a few bucks off of Scarface suckers like me. <br /> <br />To my surprise, the movie was just as advertised. The image looks sharp and clean, and the sound is a phenomenal compared to the predecessors. It's as though the movie could have come out last week. If you've never seen Scarface, buy this DVD because you need to see it. If you've seen it a few times, buy it because you need to see it more. If you own every other version of Scarface, buy this DVD because it truly is a step up in quality from the release it followed.
B000BCKFWK|3.0|This is a great movie for those of you that have or have not read the graphic novels by Frank Miller. However, this edition really leaves a lot to want. Yes, it has a few uncut and extended scenes, but they are not placed into the main movie format. They extended version is separated by story arc instead of molded into the theatrical version. However, the book the DVD comes with is a fun read. If you really liked the movie, like I did, then this might be something to consider. I bought it because it came with the graphic novel. I was not disappointed about that.
1881273156|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good basic \\"how to get along better with your mate\\" book.  I have been married for 35 years and it was fun to take the test with my mate.  It was an easy read.

B000I2IT44|5.0|I must admit that I'm biased when it comes to mentioning the band Porcupine Tree, because, they are a favorite of mine.So, my review will be a positive one.The band with the addition of another guitarist/vocalist is unbeatable.They are all excellent musicians and their repertoire is fanatastic. I think that they are a band that continually reaches for musical levels in all aspects.They are, in my mind, under-rated, with little or no exposure here in Canada.The DVD is superb!! The production, the songs and the musicianship are all first-class!! Check it out.

020530902X|4.0|I gave \\"The Elements of Style\\" by William Strunk to my grandchildren as a secret weapon.  Mr. Strunk has written a clear presentation of the rules of syntax, grammar and punctuation. It's fit in a pocket size will let them take it to school and actually have it available to them for reference. This book should be present in anyone's library if for no other reason than to remind one to put verbs in sentences!
B000GUJYRE|5.0|Over the years I've generally enjoyed live Boston Symphony performances conducted by Haitink more than I've enjoyed his recordings.  However, with this excellent LSO set of the Beethoven syphonies that has changed.  While I don't believe this is the \\"perfect\\" set of Beethoven symphonies, it comes as close as any set I've heard recently.  I am very fond of Mackerras' set with Liverpool with period informed performances.  However, I enjoy these LSO performances just as much with the more modern interpretations.  The highlights of this set for me are really exceptional versions of symphonies 4,7, and 9.  The seventh here is particularly memorable and exciting, with brisk tempi and crisp articulation and sound.  The soloists on the ninth are also wonderful.  The fifth here has received much critical acclaim, although I find it driven a little too fast at times which for me detracts from the overall impact.  Just my opinion.  The third is very good also, although I'm not sure what exactly would recommend it when compared to other fine versions out there.  I still enjoy Harnoncourt's third with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe quite a bit.  The others here, nos. 1, 2, 6, and 8 are all given really quite good performances with very good sound.  This set beats Haitink's earlier Concertgebouw set by a fair margin and I think will compete well with just about any modern set on the market.  The SACD is certainly a benefit.  It's a pretty good bargain too.
B00002SSKI|5.0|My 14-year-old daughter and I rented this movie years ago and bought it on VHS to watch over and over.  However, the tape had become worn and frayed... distorted while we watched it.  So... I had to buy a new one on DVD so we can continue watching it over and over! :)
B00005Y228|5.0|\\"Can't get you out of my head.\\" Enough said.
0375831002|5.0|This remarkable book has received much praise and publicity as a \\"crossover\\" title, and deservedly so.  Adults will be as fascinated with this unusual tale as much as young adults, although some may be put off by the book's considerable heft.  Zusak, the Australian author of popular YA titles, tries his hand at historical fiction, but the fascinating narrator of the tale; Death himself, is the thing that makes this book extraordinary. <br /> <br />Death is the wry observer of those many sordid things humans do to each other that are simply out of his control. He relates the story of Liesel Meminger, a young foster girl living near Munich in Nazi Germany, from his first encounter with her at age 8, to six years later, when the war ended in 1945.  Among all the humans whose souls he gathers during wartime, Death takes a special interest in Liesel, the \\"book thief\\", when he realizes she can't resist taking books that don't belong to her.  The cast of characters also includes Liesel's accordion-playing foster father, her foul-mouthed foster mother, her best friend and fellow street urchin, Rudy, and a very frightened Jew named Max, who is hidden in the basement. <br /> <br />This book is a fresh look at the Holocaust from the other side of the fence.  The author imagines what war brings to the average German citizen, especially to those who live only steps away from a concentration camp.  Much of the plot centers on the wartime experiences of childhood pals Leisel and Rudy, neighbors from Himmel Street, who don't quite comprehend the goings-on around them as clearly as the reader does. <br /> <br />As Leisel starts collecting her books, through outright thievery or through gifts, Death, the gentle narrator, becomes more and more compelled to tell her story. The well-developed cast of characters makes the book compelling reading, but it is the wry observances of Death and the authors remarkable use of imagery and language, that cause the reader to pause, think about thewonderful phrasing, and then carefully open the book again to discover what other incredible insights into friendship, decency and the human condition Zuzak has to offer us.  Highly recommended for ages 12 and up.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I appreciated the creative cinamatography's use of small numbers of actors (extra's) to simulate the large battlefield scenes.  Masterful.  The treatment of both Crusaders and Muslims was probably more generous than in reality, but after all, it is a movie based loosely on historical events with the usual poetic license to dramatize.
0618680004|1.0|As I write this, I note that 344 others have felt enough interest to pen their comments; almost all of them well reasoned and clearly thought out. Am I the only reader on the Planet who found this mishmash unreadable? Richard Dawkins is judged to be a giant in his field, yet to me it seems that he has written hundreds of pages of gibberish, most of which sound as though they were dictated, while high, at a sophmore high school friday night get together of a group of would be intellectuals. <br /> <br />One who would undertake a serouis interest in exploring the nature of the existance of a Diety, would do well to avoid all contact with this ametuerish, angry diatribe, whose interminable pages of nothingness blather on and on, into insensability.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I would give it more stars...but 5 was the limit I could choose. Having seen Pink Floyd in concert a coulple of times  myself, this DVD captures their genius and then some. <br />If there could be any thing possibly lacking, it  would be the absence of Roger Waters, but this DVD will be sure to please. A MUST have for any true Floyd fan.
B000E41MS6|4.0|$65 for 13 episodes of a TV show seems drastically out of line with \\"full season\\" box sets of other shows, such as Homicide, CSI, or Law & Order. <br /> <br />That said, this is a great show and both new and old Dr. Who fans will find it amazingly accessible.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|Liza Minnelli's concerts are always an incredible showcase of her talents. Having seen her many times onstage, I think this concert is one of her all-time best. A highly imaginative and original show with great material and Liza in peak form.Watch the singing actress at work in SORRY I ASKED or QUIET LOVE and with all the women dancers in STEPPING OUT(where's the DVD of that underrated film?) This show makes one wish for DVD releases of her first HBO concert from 1979(once on video) and her second one from London(1985..never on video) not to mention her other TV specials.
B000AADYUI|4.0|Anyone who takes this album too seriously, literally or figuratively needs to chill & listen.  It's great to hear a bunch of old friends get together and play music.  This is what the early 70's were all about and that's what this album signifies.  Great ear candy!!!
020161622X|5.0|I've been developing software for 10+ years - the ideas presented here are refreshing and useful and SURPRISINGLY new. Not all the ideas are new, but the ones that are - are gems. Aside from wishing that I had read this book long ago when it first came out, I'm grateful to have it now. Take it for a test drive. You'll love it.
0061122416|2.0|I saw all the great reviews and the title sounded interesting so I decided to purchase this book. There have been only two or three books in my life that I had to drag myself through, and this is one of them. <br /> <br />Sure, the message is inspirational and all that, but the writing is so simplistic that it teeters on childlike. Coelho is repetitive and it really seems as though he is writing for a 10-year-old. This is not great literature; this is a self-help book masquerading as literature for people who don't seem to realize that they have no concept of what makes a good novel. I would give this novel to a pre-teen or a person who has never willingly read a quality book in their life. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm naive or sheltered, but I am amazed by the amount of people who are so flabbergasted about the whole \\"following your dreams\\" thing. Have we never heard of that before? It's not exactly a brand new idea.
0618551050|4.0|I enjoyed the style by which the author presented his case and the courage that he shows by taking on the closed minded academics who unfortunately populate our Universities at this time in history. <br />    He has expressed a concern which many scientist have today, and that is if you dare go against the alleged majority point of view you will be punished with ostracism and ridicule. He shows that today there are really very few true scholars and scientist who still understand the meanng of there titles. To be a scientist you must Truly be interested in pursuing the Truth no matter where it takes you. You must be able to look at \\"That\\" which contradicts \\"That\\" which you want to be true. Only if our academics are willing to constantly re-examine their own belief systems can we truly call them Scholars and Scientist. I highly recomend this book to anyone who wants to obtain a knowledge of \\"STRING THEORY\\" and at the same time read the truth about the fact that it is still just a \\"Theory\\" and can not possibly be proven one way or another at this time. It really is OK not to accept it as fact. Maybe if more Scientist start speaking out about the same concerns that Mr. Smolin has expressed we will begin to finally make some real strides forward in Physics. <br /> <br />
0618680004|1.0|I recomend this book to all Christians and Jews who have had their doubts concerning the existense of God.  <br />Now we know how closed minded and bigoted these athiest can be. Their hero, Mr. Dawkins, has very eloquently shown us that he doesn't care if God exists or not, he will not believe because he doesn't want to. In his own words he states that on a scale of 1 to 7, concerning belief of God (1 being a die-hard believer and 7 a die-hard non believer)he is a 6. He goes on to state that he understands that there is a remote chance that there is indeed a God but in his estimation it is so \\"remote\\" that he just can't be bothered. Anyone of an average IQ should be able to deduce that if there is the REMOTEST CHANCE of there being A SUPREME BEING then there can be no more important quest in life then the pursuit of that knowledge which may lead us closer to an understanding of such a being. The book is well written and you can truly get the feeling for the authors honest attempt at rationalizing his non-belief. I'm a little puzzled at why he would allow an endorcement by a magician who states that if all of civilization does not believe as Mr. Dawkins does then, \\"we are all \\"Srewed.\\" Mr. Dawkins should have had a little more class and respect for his readers and should not have allowed such a childish and condescending remark to be associated with his book. After all there are a lot of men and women who are as intelligent as either he or his magician friend who actually have pondered the idea of, God or no God, and they come to the conclusion, there just might be such a Being. The reason why I recomend this book is anyone with an open mind can very quickly see that Mr. Dawkins has a clear prejudice against those people who are just not as brilliant as he and his like-minded co-horts. Enjoy the read and most likely, if you are open minded, you will see the huge gaps in his failed logic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000F3AAUW|5.0|If you like \\" Crazy \\" on this CD, you will love the rest of it also.  Great to listen to anytime.
1400064287|5.0|The title should be \\"How to communicate: getting attention and holding interest\\"--but that would violate the message of the book. It wouldn't be unexpected and it wouldn't itself be interesting. This is an easy read, filled with eye-opening research and concrete examples that show how you can expose a gap in your listener's knowledge and then help them fill it with your message. As another reviewer mentioned, the book illustrates its own principles--you won't forget the essential message and techniques any time soon. On the other hand, it can be a bit glib and glossy at times--after all, the authors don't know what you're actually trying to do with their techniques--so the book's message grows too abstract in spots. It belongs on your shelf alongside other high-concept books like \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\\" I'm certainly glad to be one of the first to own what will certainly be \\"accepted wisdom\\" by summer.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Team America: World Police is a madcap concept: lampoon America's current war-frenzied culture with marionettes.  Who would possibly want to watch such a film?<br /><br />On the film's surface, the very appearance of the marionettes, being pulled by someone else's invisible strings, seems to have some symbolic value.  Or maybe they just thought it would be funny to have puppets do things that no puppets should ever do.<br /><br />The movie also a throwback to Thunderbirds, a futuristic series produced in 1965 that heavily utilized \\"supermarionation,\\" which used marionettes suspended and controlled by thin wires. In that series, the marionettes were played with deadly seriousness, despite the fact that they were, you know, puppets. You have to ask why creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone would want to use a technique few people remember from the sixties...unless they were making a statement about an era that also happened to involve an unpopular war. Ahem.<br /><br />It's very easy to dismiss Team America as farcical garbage, a lewd, violent attack on every sacred crow conceivable.  And on the surface, Team America can be appreciated for that alone: a conservative organization that espouses American values with unabashed patriotism sends Team America to blow up bad guys while destroying the homes and artifacts of the people they're trying to save; a liberal nutjob (Michael Moore) turns into a suicide bomber; Kim Jong Il really IS part of an axis of evil manipulating terrorists to blow up the world; actors with no experience in warfare speak out about the war, forming the Film Actors Guild (FAG); and a struggling actor named Gary is recruited from a Broadway musical that sounds suspiciously like Rent. Nobody is safe in Team America.<br /><br />But anyone who watches South Park knows that Parker and Stone are far shrewder than their \\"supercrappymation\\" might lead one to believe.  They are the deconstructionists of our age, fearlessly criticizing hypocrites everywhere, whatever their political, global, or religious affiliation might be.  Only these two would compare a Middle-Eastern bar to the cantina from Star Wars...because frankly that's about the most exposure Americans have ever had to Middle-Eastern cultures.  Heck, even the title \\"World Police\\" is laden with assumptions about America's global responsibility or lack thereof. Even Matt Damon, whom Parker and Stone think is actually a pretty cool guy, gets turned into a monosyllabic thug.  Trust me, he got off easy.<br /><br />They never let you forget that this is all done with puppets too: real black cats are substituted for panthers, puppets slap each other helplessly in some pathetic approximation of a fist-fight, and two opponents slow down and spin in the air as they face off, Matrix-style...all with the help of their marionette strings. And I don't need to mention what the puppets do to/with each other in the bedroom...<br /> There are also parts that are a little dated.  Yes, making fun of Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor is always fun, but it dates the film.  Rent's also an easy target...but does anyone really care that much about Rent to make fun of it?<br /><br />Team America mows down anything and everything with a no holds barred approach. If you take yourself a little too seriously, chances are you'll find this movie offensive or irrelevant.  But if you aren't afraid to laugh at the inanities of the modern world, as viewed through the seriously warped lens of big-budget action movies, then you'll probably enjoy Team America: World Police as a hilarious romp through a decade our descendants will most assuredly find amusing.or religious affiliation might be.

1586210912|5.0|Awesome!!!  We loved it!!!  My husband and I were both extremely encouraged and inspired by the words of wisdom this resource had to offer. <br />We especially enjoyed having the CD version of the book because it made it more convenient for us to experience together as well as enabled us the flexibility of taking it with us when we were on the go and driving in the car.  We highly reccomend this product in Book or CD Format!
B00000K3CM|5.0|I remember the DAY I first saw Home Alone (the original).  I had been exposed to a NEW comedy, a genuis comedy that allowed kids to be much craftier than adults!  That movie paved the way for other greats like \\"Blank Check\\" and of course \\"Home Alone 2 - Lost in New York\\".  I haven't seen it yet, but I love the concept and am quite certain they've done it again!<br /><br />Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) will come out on top - just like he has with his current acting endeavors.  You go boy!  (I don't really talk like that, but you know what I mean!)

B000H30B2C|5.0|King Kong contains more breathtaking moments than any movie I've ever seen.  From a scene where someone is wildly shooting giant mosquitos with a machine gun (without hitting the person the mosquitos are swarming around) to the power of love between woman and ape.  It all culminates with a majestic ice skating scene that will bring you back to the nostalgia of Brian Boitano.  I love movies that find a way to make the unnatural (a giant, wild ape playfully ice skating in a foreign land with a human being he has developed feelings for) seem natural.<br /><br />This movie teaches that if you want something bad enough, you can get it.  Example, the giant ape learns to speak the word \\"beautiful\\" both in sign language *and* in English!  The irony here is that he thought the sunset and woman were beautiful, but he probably lacked the intelligence to grasp that his behavior that night was the most beautiful thing of all!
0618680004|5.0|It's too bad it will be mostly the choir that reads this wonderful project; Dawkins has the nerve and reputation to tackle a controversy that few others will take a stand on, and it is to his credit that he so masterfully accomplishes what he sets out to do. But his reputation, and the title, may mean the book is not read but just those people whom we most need to engage in real, reasoned debate, to deal with a problem causing so many of the world's current problems. <br />\\"Choir members\\" and members of the \\"other\\" choir would both do well to read this fine book, then choose to engage and debate and reason together, for the betterment of us all.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|An inconvenient truth is a movie about an aspiring environmentalist named Al Gore.  Al travels the country collecting information and presenting it to the public.  It dragged a little in the middle, and offered little in the realm of comedic value or romance.  In the end, Al finishes this huge presentation (which takes up most of the movie) and the audience is captivated by it!<br /><br />Overall, it has a happy ending, but I have to give it 2 stars because it was a bit slow and didn't have a \\"deleted scenes\\" feature (which is a MUST now-a-days).
0743201140|1.0|I have an interest in the various strenghts and weaknesses we all have, and how to understand and make use of a knowledge of those qualities, but this book was all about how to market yourself, products, whatever. That itself (marketing ability) was presented as the point of the exercises in the book. For me, it was a waste of money, and a waste of reading time. I'd rather read something of real value... <br />Yuck.

0060853964|5.0|I read a lot, but rarely do I reread books.  This book, along with Philip Pulman's \\"Golden Compass\\" and some of Tamora Pierce's books are among the very few exceptions.  This book came highly recomended to me by a friend, and I feel compelled to pass it on.  When I started reading it, I was in a room full of people.  After half an hour, I had been laughing so much that everyone else had left.  The authors's irreverance is akin to Douglas Adam's \\"Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\".  \\"Good Omens\\" offers a fresh, honest, (perhaps even touching perspective) on God while making a merry mockery of religion.  It's a deliciously refreshing reminder to not to take yourself too seriously.  I liked the book so much after reading the library's copy, that I bought it just so I could highlight my favorite parts (and make my friends and family read it).

B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is one of the classics already. Tim Robbins gives such a gentle performance and Morgan Freeman is just flawless.

0060887303|5.0|Alison is perfect --- beautiful, witty, smart and popular. The girls want to be her, and the boys want to kiss her. Alison is a best friend, in more ways than one. But things are not always as they seem. Hanna is a nice person, just a little overweight. Steadily putting on the pounds since her parents divorced, Hanna is having her own time of coping with things. Emily is a swimmer, just like the rest of her family. Living the \\"blah\\" life, Emily is just blending in. Aria is different. Her likes and dislikes are borderline weird, at least to others. Aria just doesn't fit in. And Spencer has to deal with living in her sister's shadow. Sometimes, Spencer is just sick of the competition. <br /> <br />Things get really crazy when the girls have a sleepover at Spencer's and an argument gets out of hand. Alison disappears and they never hear from her again. Fast forward three years, and things have certainly changed. The remaining four girls don't even speak now. Aria's family moved away to Finland and just got back. Aria is used to hanging with older guys now and ends up wanting a relationship with her new teacher. Someone just bought Alison's old house with a teenager and bonds with Emily. The problem is, this new resident is helping Emily find out who she really is. Does Emily want to face the music? After many years, Hanna is no longer overweight and has a new set of friends and circumstances to deal with. Hanna finds out the hard way that wanting attention and being Barbie isn't all it's cracked up to be. Spencer is still living in her big sister's shadow but has her own agenda. It's not her fault that all her sister's boyfriends want her. <br /> <br />Soon, the creepiness begins. Someone is watching them all, with information on events that happened three years ago --- events that only each one of them knew...and Alison. But she's gone, right? Who else could twist their past and bring it into the future? Whoever it is, they know a little too much and are hell-bent onhurting them all, one way or another. As the girls are already spooked, things don't get any better when all their current secrets come tumbling out of the woodwork. Who's telling? <br /> <br />To make matters even stickier, the police finally find Alison's body...buried in her backyard. When they all come together again, it's at her memorial. No one is expecting the biggest secret to show up as well. It's no fun as the memorial ends and they all receive simultaneous text messages. From who? None other than Alison herself, letting them know she's still around, still watching and still exacting revenge. <br /> <br />Sara Shepard does an amazing job in this first installment of a four-book series. With mystery, intrigue and true-to-life characters, Shepard takes readers into a world of fake and fanciful spoiled brats. These are people who seemingly have it all, but when you delve a little deeper, they have just as many issues as the next kid. As PRETTY LITTLE LIARS expertly crafts just enough suspense to leave you waiting for the next book, one thing is for certain: high school will never be the same! <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Belinda Williams
B000JK8OYU|5.0|For over forty years, I have been listening to and collecting Beatles music, text and memorabilia. When you accept your fate as a \\"fan\\", you present yourself with the need for more and more of that great thing.  When the band dissolves 37 years ago, it poses a problem as to how to get your next Beatles fix! <br /> <br />Lost tapes, re-mixes, etc. have come and gone but always maintained a status quo.  \\"Love\\" has shattered that mediocrity by exhibiting a creativity equal to that of the Beatles themselves.  It was george harrison who approached Cirque du Soleil and with a close friendship growing between the director and George, the concept was developed for the show.  As a result, we have been privledged to be able to hear \\"Love\\". <br /> <br />George and Nigel Martin have created an album of mixed and layered sounds from the entire Beatles Library. The creativity is equal to anything that George Martin did when the Beatles were together.  Because memories are most triggered by music, the overlapping and layering of sounds and lyrics whips you around the room like any ride at an amusement park.  Memories pop up and crash into others at the change of a chord or an electronic sound. <br /> <br />I can only thank the Martins for their gift to the world in maintaining the Beatles legacy and the brilliance of the Martins. <br /> <br />This is close as you are ever going to get to cramming 13 albums into one and result in a total understanding of a time and the power of four men to change the world.
0525476881|5.0|I'll admit. I was thrown by the cover. If I hadn't been familiar with John Green's impressive debut, LOOKING FOR ALASKA, I might have passed AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES by, assuming it was a self-help book. But nothing was going to stop me from diving straight into Green's sophomore offering. There is a condition in the book world that goes by many names, most often known as \\"sophomoritis.\\" This refers to the follow-up work by a debut novelist where said follow-up is often judged to be inferior to the original work that caused a stir. <br /> <br />I am pleased to report: there will be none of that here. <br /> <br />AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES is the story of Colin Singleton who, at the end of his high school career, is unceremoniously dumped by a girl named Katherine. It must be noted that she is, in fact, the 19th girl named Katherine with which Colin has had a relationship, none of which ended very well. Mired in rejection and plagued with the knowledge that his status of \\"child prodigy\\" is nearly at an end, Colin sets off on a walkabout with his best friend, Hassan, with the idea of finding a mathematical formula that can predict where any relationship will head (and thus elevate him to the adult status of \\"genius\\"). <br /> <br />The pair takes a road trip to Gutshot, Tennessee, where they are hired to chronicle the town's oral history and find themselves involved with the locals in ways they never imagined. Yes, there's some math involved but it's nothing that should scare anyone away. (Plus, there's a handy appendix at the back that explains how everything works.) <br /> <br />This novel is gripping in its simplicity and stunning in its originality. Decidedly less dark than LOOKING FOR ALASKA, Green loses none of his bite in exploring the angst of a teen facing familiar coming-of-age problems compounded with the anxieties only a genius can feel. If you've visited the author's blog, you know his penchant for wry humor --- and that's what comes to the forefront and gives AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES its driving tenor. As with LOOKING FOR ALASKA, Green demonstrates his uncanny ability to craft interesting, three-dimensional characters in much the way that Georges Seurat built a masterpiece with a million tiny dots. <br /> <br />Combine the witty writing, the lifelike characters and the ingenuity of the story, and it seems certain that Green has another hit on his hands. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Brian Farrey (emohawk9000@gmail.com)
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I have known about Johnny Cash for decades but was just never into classic country western music.  When country became a bit more pop, there were a handful of artists that captured my attention. <br /> <br />As Johnny Cash began to appeal to the younger listener, I jumped on board and gave him a chance.  To hear him belt out a Nine Inch Nails song and enter the progressive arena and battle the younger artists and come out on top was just too admirable to pass up.  It was this CD that brought me to this conclusion.  It represents a man at a final stage in his life and offers a lot of emotional retrospection and emotion. <br /> <br />I have since begun to explore backwards chronilogically his earlier works and find the man complex and intriguing.  If you are interested in tapping into an American great, this CD is a perfect place to begin.
0345349571|4.0|The 14th century, often thought of for little more than the bubonic plague and Chaucer's stories, was a critical period for the evolution of Western culture.  Ms. Tuchman uses the device of following the career of one French nobleman, the Sire de Coucy, to expand on the events and occurances in France, England, Germany, Italy, and the Near East that flowed from the eternal struggle for power and riches, the attractive but ineffective sway of chivalry, and the competition for religious dominance between factions of Christianity, and between Christianity and Islam.  National boundaries, identities, and spheres of influence for hundreds of years following were determined by the fallible actions of rulers and ruled during the 1300's.  For example, the battle at Nicopolis sealed the dominence of the Ottoman Empire in southeastern Europe for the next 500 years, and the antipathy between Cyprus and Turkey was seeded in this century. <br /> <br />In a fast paced and very readable narrative, this book covers a lesser known period and renders it interesting and critical to understanding the world's history.
0803730470|5.0|This is a great book from one of my favorite children's authors, Julia Donaldson.  If you have not read any of her books, I highly recommend The Gruffalo as the first.  Her rhyming pattern is quite effective and does not feel monotonous like some other children's rhyming word books do.  The story is fun to read and you cheer for the mouse as he ventures through the woods while trying to avoid becoming a meal for the other animals he encounters.  A favorite bed time story.  Also check out \\"Room on the Broom\\" by the same author--another fabulous book.

B000F8O35U|1.0|I love the movie The Little Mermaid and when it went out as a Special Edition I decided to buy it right away.  I did not open it until my nephews/nieces stayed at my house for a sleep over on Dec 21.  I put the dvd for them and noticed that the dvd did not have the voice/action synchronize for a good part of the movie.  My nephews/nieces were more concentrated on noticing the errors than in the movie itsel. Total fiasco.  I couldn't return it because your return policy specifies 30 days after purchase as limit to return an item.  I did not expect it to a bad item, but it turned out to be one. <br /> <br />Thanks.
0812975219|5.0|This book was right up my alley, as a personal investor and also someone interested in the way randomness/probability/noise affects our lives. If you have an interest those areas, and like to be introspective, I'd guess you'd like this book. It was interesting to learn more about asymmetric payoffs, and how humans are not wired to see them accurately (or to weigh abstract vs. concrete accurately). Although I'm an active and somewhat successful investor, I'm far from sophisticated, and I felt this book exposed me to some concepts that I want to learn more about. But most of all, I think it helps one to see the big picture better, and see that there is often more complexity than is painted in a \\"bullish vs. bearish\\" outlook.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|While some songs I would have loved to have put on the album (Paperback Writer, Birthday, and a few others) I have to say that the remastering is awesome.  I can hear things that I never knew existed before on my regular cd's.  The high point on this album is Ringo's drumming.  It was always stuck in the DEEP background and hence I thought it was because John, Paul & George didn't think it was that great.  This cd negates all of that.  This album brings Ringo's fine drumming to the forefront.  I think they did it PURPOSELY as they did not want a repeat of the Pete Best incident, where Mr. Best stole some of their limelight.  They all did Ringo a BIG injustice!!
1593082045|5.0|I really like the book from the inside out. Sturdy with an excellent binding, printed using easily readable font, and contains a nice touch of antiquity with the slightly torn pages on the side. Looks exactly like the first volume, though the background color of the pictures on the cover, side, and back is red and not blue. <br /> <br />For this kind of money it is a real bargain and I recommend it for anyone who wishes to venture into the magnificent world of Sherlock Holmes.

0307237699|3.0|Mr Obama presents a picture of himself as a solid, yet practical, liberal who is willing to \\"understand the other side\\". As a relative newcomer to the political scene, that may still be true. <br /> <br />I missed his coming-out speech at the Democrat convention since I don't generally watch convention coverage - it's pretty pointless, as are all political \\"debates\\".  <br /> <br />My take? He seems like a \\"real\\" person. If he conveys this in his campaigning, he can go far (as if he hasn't already). <br /> <br />Politicians seem to crank out the books to give their candidacy legitimacy. I doubt that it's worth their time though. The VAST MAJORITY of Americans never read books after they get out of school, and those FEW that will read a book like this are already pretty set in their political views. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000G1ALRK|3.0|I'm a big fan of country music; I buy a lot of country albums year in year out, and listen to more online. When I write reviews, I'm usually very generous in giving out ratings. With this album, the most generous I can get is to give a 3.5 rating. Eric Church's work is indeed honest, his voice sounds sincere, but his songs are nothing we haven't heard before; in other words, they're full of overused cliches. The problem I see with some country albums nowadays, especially from newcomers is there's one or 2 pretty strong tracks, they entitle the album after its strongest track, throw in 8 or 9 more songs to fill an EP then there you go: Another album from another one-hit-wonder.<br /><br />If you're a \\"completist\\" like me, go out and get this but for those out looking for a good introduction to country music, skip this, there are tons of other good choices.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Arguably the best album ever produced.  The melodies, the beats, the bass lines, even the so-called \\"noise\\" on the album: everything placed with precision within the music. <br />If I were allowed to own only one Radiohead album, it would be this one.
B000J103PC|4.0|It's easy to dismiss this flick as fluff.  But men who would ordinarily sniff their noses should see this film as a primer to the psyche of women.  I went to see this film last summer when it was in the theatres with my fiancee(now wife).  What caused her to sit at the edge of her seat was not the story or the superb acting but the proliferation of high-end brand names (Gucci, etc.) and the parade of \\"Style\\" channel celebrities(Valentino? Who?).  It made me feel cheap for giving her a Coach handbag for her birthday.  What elevates this film is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast.  Meryl Streep as a high fashion Cruella De Ville gives a nuanced performance that is the stuff of legend.  Emily Blunt (should be Oscar nominated) follows close behind as Streep's snooty assistant.  The underrated Stanley Tucci as a magazine staffer gives a performance bereft of stereotype.  Anne Hathaway, probably inspired by the talent around her, holds her own with this talented cast.  To summarize, this flick is froth with substance.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Most reviewers describe the Hoover clan as dysfuncional which is erroneous.  The Hoovers are flawed individuals yet somehow cohere as a loving family unit.  \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is a celebration of the differences that exist in pretty much all families but are afraid to admit it.  The film also succeeds as an indictment of the beauty pageant mentality that perpetuates the Jonbenet Ramsey syndrome that unfortunately exists in our society.  No film has skewered the beauty pageant culture so expertly since Michael Ritchie's \\"Smile\\" in 1975.  The cast is uniformly excellent but special citations should go to Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.  Arkin, whose star rose in the sixties but has kind of waned in recent years, gives a cliche free performance as the drugtaking grandpa.  Breslin, as Olive, has the formidable chore of being the optimistic glue that holds the Hoover clan together.  The tender scene between Arkin and Breslin prior to the pageant is heart-rending.  I cite Arkin and Breslin only because that of the cast members they should not be forgotten come Oscar time.  For that matter the film shouldn't be forgotten by the Academy members either.

B000JVT1U0|5.0|For the longest time I had heard about a little known (at least in the States) 1973 cult-horror film called \\"The Wicker Man\\". Whenever, I read any rare mentions of it in the media, it had always received rave reviews from anyone, who had the chance to see it. This piqued my interest greatly. Enough so, that I purchased the film, without any real knowlege of what the film was about. Well, once in awhile a 'shot in the dark' does pay off. This turned out to be an amazingly, fascinating movie.<br /><br />The story takes place in the UK and involves Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward), a moral and religious man, who takes his duties as an officer of the law, quite seriously. He recieves an anonymous note (with a photograph), that a 12 year old girl named Rowan Morrison has disapeared and not been seen for months. The Officer travels by sea plane to the private, remote Scottish island, where the young girl is from to investigate. But things don't seem to go as planned. The people, who live on the island, act very odd and secretive. Everything seems off-kiltered. Officer Howie is a stanger in a stange land. The odd man out. The more he finds out about both the ways of the island's strange inhabitants, their charismatic leader, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) and the fate of Rowan Morrison, the more convuluted and bizarre things get. Ultimately the answers to his investigation lead to a \\"Twilight Zone\\"-like ending.<br /><br />To merely call \\"The Wicker Man\\" a horror film would be a diservice. It is so much more than that. It is mystery, a suspense-thriller and most of all a meditation on the meaning of faith and religion. It is well written, superbly casted and brillaintly acted. This film is perhaps one of the best films in Actor, Christopher Lee's long career. Kudos should also go to Edward Woodward playing a man who's faith is being tested. Also notice should go to the stunningly beautiful, Britt Ekland, who has created one of the sexiest scenes in British cinema. Mention should also be made of the wonderful '70s folk soundtrack, that adds to the creepy atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />I have seen both the butchered 'Theatrical' version of the film and the 'Extended' version (made up of scenes, film elements, once thought to be lost). Both are included in this \\"2-Disc Collector's Set\\". The 'Extended' version is the one to watch. The added scenes are not mere padding. They greatly add to the depth of the characters (especially in the case of Sergeant Howie) and helps explain the chioces they make. This is really an amazing film, that gives the viewers something to think about, long after its' over. It's one of those films that you will not easily forget! Highly recommended!made of the wonderful '70s folk soundtrack, that adds to the creepy atmosphere of the film.

B000FIMG68|4.0|While nobody would expect this to be a serious study of what would happen to a group of survivors stranded on a remote island, the writing of \\"Lost\\" is superb. Somehow, the most far-fetched, psuedo-science fiction story lines survive because the writers constantly surprise us with completely unexpected twists. As soon as you might think you know what is happening to the survivors or to one person, there is a complete shock or plot-twist making you re-examine what you think is happening. With both spiritual & psuedo-paganist themes, this is a highly interesting series, and a superb examination of human-nature & character study. Just as you can't ever be sure of the plot lines, it is also a credit to writers of \\"Lost\\" that people whom you might be inclined to judge early, turn out to show inner complexities and mixes of nobility & flaws. Very highly recommended.

1401302378|3.0|Yes, verbose is the word for this book. It is quite useful at taking the concepts presented and reiterating them over and over until the book is fluffed with enough pages to publish. Over and over and over again, the same thing is printed in the same and slightly different ways. <br /> <br />Now, let me also say, that the information presented with such painstaking repetitiveness is very good. It takes concepts that we already understand and solidifys them into a very complete comprehensive understanding that fits countless facets of life - as a consumer or proprietor. <br /> <br />In short, I'm very glad I read it, but probably couldn't take reading it again. Should be boiled down to a $10 e-book.

B000AU9UYM|2.0|I really wanted to be awed by this movie after reading the rave reviews. Finally, a great Batman movie, but it was not to be.   <br /> <br />I found the plotting predictable and formulaic.   <br /> <br />Aside from the always wonderful Michael Caine, the acting is lackluster. I love Gary Oldman but he was given little to work with.  Bale's portrayal was stiff and forced and the overly-fake dark, tough-guy voicing was unintentionally funny.   <br /> <br />If fear is a central tenet of the movie and the character, the movie did little to evoke that emotion.  <br /> <br />The scenes early in the film with Liam Neeson reminded me so much of the old Kung Fu TV series, I half expected Neeson to refer to Bale as \\"grasshopper\\". <br /> <br />Aside from some interesting outdoor mountain footage, the cinematography is not particularly exciting. Whereas movies like Dark City and Sin City broke new ground with their distinctive looks, Batman Begins' Gotham City doesn't have any distinguishing characteristic beyond that really cool overhead train.  There is nothing particularly dark and ominous.  For a city that's supposed to be like a modern day Sodom, it looked better than most American cities. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the comic, you'll probably love the film as it is much more true to the spirit of the series than the silly \\"sequels\\".  <br /> <br />It's not a bad film by any stretch.  Just not great, either. <br />
B0008ENHTE|4.0|the only worth scene in this movie is the car chase, besides that, nothing was worthy for you to praise too much. mcqueen acted like absent-minded, senseless, numb and even a bit dumb detective without any facial expression or emotion through out the whole movie. the script got lot of holes. the directing was just like mcqueen's performance, one dimensional tardiness. guess at that time anyone could bring a gun aboard an airplane.<br />this movie only confirmed on thing: most of the movie critics considered steve mcqueen just a mediocre actor, even worse than ronald reagon. he only survived and mysteriously thrived from the action packed movies.

I don't think she's a bad actor, i just think someone else would have been better for that part.
B000HIVO64|4.0|Who's as consistently interesting (read:unexpected) that Mr. Beck Hansen? That's right, nobody. A few albums in and he's still the most interesting pop musician on the scene.

0823023494|4.0|I thought this book would be mostly about cartooing, but was pleasantly surprised.  Although the characters included are reminiscent of cartoons, the theory and suggestions provided can be applied to anyone creating characters for books or other needs.  Although I haven't done it yet (and to be honest, probably won't) the project included in the book that you are supposed to do as you advance in your reading seems like a great excercise of the mind and pencil.  I love seeing the different interpretations of the same characters from the news paper comic's point of view, the illustrator's point of view, etc.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like the bug it's named after, this show burned very brighly for an instant.  I never even knew it was on TV, but I heard about it after the fact through friends once the DVD series set was released.<br /><br />I can't really say anything about this show that hasn't been said, but I supposed the most amazing thing to me about Firefly is that my wife doesn't even like sci-fi as a genre, but she really loved this series.<br /><br />The stories and the characters transcend the genre.  Firefly isn't just great sci-fi, but great story telling period.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|I really can't say enough about this concert.  It took me back about 20 years to when I listened to Rainbow on a daily basis.   <br /> <br />First off, I was impressed with the audio and video quality.  It wasn't 2007 perfect but it was probably the best the 70s had to offer.   <br /> <br />As for the music, it's an allstar lineup.  Blackmore (fresh out of jail) arrived 3 hours late for the concert but it seemed to add to the aggressiveness of his playing and the appreciation of the audience.  Evidentially, being locked up in an Austrian prison for three days does something to a man.  His playing weaved a tapestry of finger picking classical intros to classic hard rock licks to bluesy, soulful stuff.  As for his antics, you either like them or hate them but this is Blackmore at his finest. <br /> <br />Ronnie James Dio sings like a God.  This performance was no different.  He doesn't miss a note and adds a few more for extra measure.  Hey, I didn't know he smoked?   <br /> <br />Cozy Powell - what a drummer.  I had never seen him play in concert and this was a special treat.  Drum solos can be a bit contrived and admittedly, this one smacks of Bonham, however, I was highly entertained and was reminded what a huge loss it was to music when he passed.  God Bless Cozy!! <br /> <br />Combine David Stone and Bob Daisley (one of the best in the business) and you have a great bottom end through the entire show.   <br /> <br />In the special features, I thought it was a nice touch to include 3 videos from the Long Live Rock and Roll album with alternate takes.  There's also a couple of nice interviews from Bob Daisley and Colin Hart (fmr mgr.) <br /> <br />Combine all of this with the sweet $10 and change price and you can't go wrong.  GO BUY IT!!

B000J10EQU|3.0|Just a nice little boring film. The best part was Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Plot was silly and so were the characters other than Luthor. It is a comic rendition of a comic book. Watch it on Cable, save your money. Brandon is no Christopher Reeve.
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep dominates this movie as the hard, cold blooded exec of one of the leading fashion magazines. Although her character is humorless, she and the other individuals with whom she interacts add a nice level of sophisticated comedy. Also, in the end, Streep shows a half smile or smirk in acknowledgment to Anne Hathaway's decision to leave the cut throat fashion industry to lead a more normal life and have a family. Streep has been in too long to be able to leave and it appears as if she may have regretted her initial decision to stay in the fashion business.
0618477942|5.0|I have friends who say that graphic novels cannot attain depth, that they are too much of a compromise. I'm not sure I don't agree with them, but for the evidence of this book (and, perhaps, Chris Ware's \\"Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth\\", also member of the heart-rending category). Bechdel's drawings are attractive, simple and subtle, full of intriguing detail and yet stripped down, somehow, in a way that works to suggest emotional truths. If I could only write, I'd write my life with pictures, if I could only draw. But Bechdel can do both -- and if you are contemplating this book and haven't yet checked out Dykes to Watch Out For, you ought to.

0743289412|4.0|I'd agree with some of the other reviewers that the use of \\"smuck\\" became really irritating; SOWISA got up my back a bit too. I would also agree that some of Lisey's reactions weren't believable - particularly cringeworthy, for example, is the scene in Boo'ya Moon where she is temporarily reunited with Scott, yet becomes petty and spiteful about ownership the \\"african\\" blanket \\"especially if it hurts him.\\" Odd, one would think, given that she's been grieving for this man she loved for 25 years and then lost. However, I'm glad I plodded beyond the first rather convoluted 200 or so pages; it was a suitably engaging read for summer holidays and helped make up for my disappointment at Cell, which I thought stank. The substance of Scott's childhood, and the way that victims of the long boy don't die but \\"live and scream\\" was truly unsettling.  <br /> <br />Not the Big Steve's best, but far from his worst.
0838577016|5.0|The text is extremely clear and to the point.  The diagrams are also simple to understand. Every major topic in neurosci is discussed, allowing you to get an excellent foundation such that you could read any recent publications on that topic and understand completely what the authors are referring to.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I read the book this past summer, and I was curious to see how Mr. Gore was in person doing his slideshow. I was very impressed. To begin with, where was this confident and charming Al Gore during the 2000 campaign? That election might not have been so close and with a different outcome had we seen him before. Also, if you have read the book, there is a large correlation between it and the content of the film. Mr. Gore stays true to the formula he uses in the book with alternating personal thoughts and vignettes with the presentation of scientific data. However, it is impressive to see some of the footage and graphics on film versus just photographically. Most impressive was the footage of one of the inland \\"rivers\\" that had formed in Greenland alongside the graphics and explanation of how these rivers were flowing from the surface of that massive Arctic island to its base, gradually weakening it like termites weaken wood. Finally, if you have a friend or relative who is open to the idea of the seriousness of global warming, but is just not inclined to pick up a non-fiction book on the subject such as Gore's and read it, the film is a good alternative. I highly recommend it even if you have already read the book. You will be even more impressed by the serious nature of global warming than you were before.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Like all of Damien Rice's breathtaking songs, many on this CD need multiple listenings, but this is still a powerful, beautiful collection.  He touches on some familiar themes (infidelity, longing, unrequited love) particularly with the haunting \\"accidental babies\\" which is a lost-love letter that combines his lyrical poetry with a more direct, simple melody.  His longing is palpable.  \\"9 crimes\\" is likewise a poignant description of how he could be unfaithful while recognizing how he is destroying his lover.  Rice breaks different ground with songs like \\"coconut skins\\", a jangly guitar-driven track that when listened to casually may remind you pleasantly of Bob Dylan.  He smartly retains the amazing vocalist Lisa Hannigan and cellist Vyvienne Long, to whom he owes a great deal of his success.  On \\"9\\", Damien Rice recaptures the aspects of his songwriting, singing, and playing that we loved on his previous works, and explores some newer ground, with great success.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I bought it because I like their music.  I like this one as well.
B000BYA4JM|3.0|Being set in New York City, the events in the film were kind of unrealistic. But it's a comedy so I guess it doesn't matter. Madonna's acting wasn't that bad  but her character Nikki Fin sure was annoying. And what was up with those eyebrows and those silly outfits? The only time Madonna looked halfway decent in the film was when she wore that white dress. Other than that the movie was somewhat cute and entertaining.The music was also good.
0321344758|5.0|I am a professional Web developer and designer working for a large hospital and many smaller clients.  Here's what I say to members of my team and to freelancers coming to me in search of work:  <br />\\"I don't even want to see your portfolio if you haven't read this book.\\" <br /> <br />It is not the ONLY book of smart design, but it is THE book on smart design.    <br /> <br />Another one that I highly recommend, not as a substitute for \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" but as a go-along, is \\"Designing the Obvious: a common sense approach to web application design\\" by Robert Hoekman Jr. <br /> <br />If you can only afford one, get \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" or don't bother showing your portfolio to me.
B000GG4XJM|4.0|This is not a record, this is 100% fun! I keep on listening this cd on and on and on...So why not five stars in rating? Sorry, but like many other people I don't agree with the rereleases with bonus tracks 'cause it's only a way to have more money for the record companies. A cd like the original one don't need that. However, the bonus tracks are beautiful. <br />The only songs I don't like very much on this cd are \\"Froggie went a courtin'\\" and \\"How can I keep from singing\\". And now I expect an E-Steet Band cd!
0894803123|4.0|I recently purchased the Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book and found it to be wonderful and very easy to follow and understand.  We purchased the KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker Attachment from Amazon and quickly decided to try this book out.  We have made numerous quarts of ice cream, from Oreo Cookie Ice Cream to Vanilla Bean.  The recipe is easy to follow and within 25 minutes, you have fantastic tasting homemade ice cream that your friends will marvel.  Let your homemade ice cream cure or harden in the freezer before serving.  What a great recipe book!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|If you love this film you have to get this special edition.Robert Rodriguez has put together an massive collection of making of's and commentaries and the stories separated into their own short films. I REALLY LIKED THE CINEMA AUDIENCE COMMENTARY TRACK DESPITE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, (Hearing an audience cheer when Marv kills someone aint something you hear in UK cinemas!). Of course Rodriguez' and Frank Miller's commentary track is the most revealing, and the long take, is a great insight into filmmaking as you see Quentin Tarantino direct a scene in real time. <br />One of the most impressive Dvd packages I've seen.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|It has replaced Dire Straits, Brother's in Arms. <br />What can you say , but, WOW! <br />Until the Stones make a DVD Audio compilation, this will remain in the #1 slot. <br />Too many great tracks to mention <br />Run, don't walk, & buy it
0451191153|5.0|This book is my favorite all time book. I love the story, and I love the way she writes. I actually bought this edition for my son. The print is very small, so if your eyes are sensative to the small print, go for the hardbound book.<br /><br />But the book is fantastic.
B000J103N4|4.0|Excellent surround mix, except maybe, Music is Love; no rear speaker coercion. <br />Probably could've tuned down the dynamic range, 2-3 DB <br />Some tracks are TOO bright, almost distorted <br />That said; definitely worth buying, & adding to the DVD audio collection <br />P.S. The CD sounds excellent as well
B000002OX7|5.0|There are so many great songs on \\"Who's Next\\", that you could almost buy 2 of these actual cd's for the price of downloading most of the songs from it that you will like.  This thing is down to $7.50 sometimes, brand-new, which is insane for the amount of timeless music that you get.  I owned the LP as a kid, listened to it repeatedly, and it's even better now.  Acoustic masterpieces throughout.  This one has to be in your collection for it's sub-$10 price.
0060527986|5.0|I have read and re-read this book numerous times.  I pick it up when Im feeling down and need a little lift for my spirit.  Coelho is full of wisdom and the tidbits contained in his manual demonstrate his understandings of surviving the struggles of life. <br />5 stars
B000003TAR|3.0|This has a few good songs, and a lot of filler that will only satisfy the hard-core Nirvana fans because it's from Nirvana. A typical album, really, because you get used to only 25% of the songs on a cd to be what you want to listen to anyway.  Even if you don't compare it to \\"Nevermind\\" (so good it's not even funny), it's really only \\"OK\\".  For a band with such promise, it's a shame we were left with only enough really great songs from their collection to fill a couple CD's.  Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) has already given us more great songs than Nirvana in my opinion, (not \\"better\\" songs, mind you, just more, great songs), because we lost Kurt Cobain so early.  Get it if you have to have it, otherwise, there really are many better cd's out there for your hard-earned money.
0061122416|5.0|this book is the only book that I've read more than 5 times, <br />this book is the only book that I've read in 4 languages, <br />this book is the only book that really enjoyed to be its hero. <br />
B000001ESN|5.0|Yes, this is a short cd, but Rush fans know that's usually the best kind.  It leaves you wanting more, but not in a bad way.  \\"Permanent Waves\\" sort of takes you from reasoning, hurrying human beings all the way back to the beginnings of life in 6 songs.  Everyone has a favorite cd by their favorite bands.  This one's mine for Rush.  I've listened to them since the mid/late 70's, when I was introduced to \\"Fly by Night\\" (although I've been spotty since \\"Power Windows\\", mostly because I listen to a lot of different stuff now), and I have seen them live a few times through the years(ALWAYS a fun show).  This does not \\"rock out\\", although it has it's moments in \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill\\",as well as short bits in others; but it is some beautifully crafted music and lyrics, with great flow throughout.  If you think you may like it, trust me, GET IT.
B00022MUTU|5.0|Clear, not harsh sound, flat frequency response, which means they are great to mix with. They are very durable, and are extremely comfortable.  I'm here to buy a second pair.
B000003TA4|5.0|I've listened to music for a long time, and this is not \\"pop\\", as many like to describe it.  Rock/Punk with a touch of Grunge, if I HAD to label it.  This is such a work of genius, with so many great songs, that you would be crazy to pass up \\"Nevermind\\".  Several of the songs should have gotten more radio-play and would be more recognizable by the general public if there weren't already so many already being played from it!  That's how good it is.  It's fun, it's wacky, it's demented, it's deliriously fast in some parts.  Everyone who still listens to rock music, and appreciates some punk now and again, has to own this cd. Get over the naked baby cover, and listen to it.
B000HIVQBC|3.0|I just got the new edition last night and there are some interesting problems with the remaster of the dvd. I was able to do a quick comparison of cd remaster and the dvd, the dvd stereo remaster is basically a new mix, I don't have 5.1 so I listened to the stereo version only. I have a few other cd's that are remastered and I have a dvd version as well of the same album so I know what it should sound like and this dvd doesn't cut the mustard. The dvd stereo version should basically have a little more \\"pop\\" and presence compared to the cd remaster and it doesn't. The cd remaster seems good to me from what little I have listened to it. I did a comparison with the original cd and the stereo image and seperation are night and day between the two.  <br /> <br />What really surprises me is Alan Wilder was executive producer on this reissue and seems to have signed off on this dvd remaster and quite frankly I don't know why. I have an excellent pair of speakers but they are not anything like good studio monitors and I would have thought he would have picked up on this.  <br /> <br />As I mentioned earlier I have a cd remastered version of the Yes Fragile album and a dvd 5.1 version. I have listened to the stereo version of the dvd and it is the same exact mix as the cd except that, due to the higher resolution there is more pop to it and slightly better stereo image. But they are almost identical and it is hard to tell the difference, and with this reissue of Depeche Mode you can definitely tell them apart. Something is not right.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Why would you burn mp3's at 99c each, when you can get a cd with all good songs for $7.50??  Even if you only really like 6 or 7 songs on it, wouldn't you rather have the actual cd, case, booklet, etc, for nearly the same price?    This one, Van Halen's ground-breaking debut, is definitely a no-brainer when it comes to buying versus downloading.  You remember how good it was.  It's still that good.  Just buy it.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|this band is so great. ive been looking for a band that i really like and found linkin park. but i grew bored of it because they would do the same thing: sing or rap at verses but scream on choruses. But dream theater? WOW! You cant predict the song! One moment they're playing hardrock, the next, they're playing a peaceful piano piece. Somehow they make all of it match in a way and sounds GREAT!! I dont have this disk but i know most of the songs. which is After won, Root of all evil, I walk beside you, sacrificed sons, under a glass moon, innocence faded, and afterlife
B000GY729M|5.0|Here is the thing. <br /> <br />Hot fuss was mostly a novelty album. Sure, it was good - but if you were over 18 you had to almost convince yourself that it was ok to like it, ok to love it even. And after loving it, which many of us wound up doing, we naturally assumed that the next Killers record would have to be the same. Only Sam's Town is not a novelty. The sound is bigger and a bit harder to digest - especially because of the way the vocals are delivered and the less synthpop vibe. As a sophomore album, it succeeds because it keeps the catchiness of the first Killers record and adds a more edgy, adult sound. <br /> <br />At first, I thought this sound was forced, and after reading an interview with Brandon Flowers I thought that the Killers had overestimated their talents because of the grandness of their ideas. But I recalled the early U2 - how grand it was and how grand it got, and I justified Brandon's attitude. You have to think big to get big nowadays...that is just how it is. <br /> <br />The only thing about this album that annoys me now after repeated listens is the choir at the beginning of \\"Bones.\\" It completely messes up the flow of the album - but other than that, don't give up on this - I think this album takes the Killers out of the novelty category and proves that they are here to stay.
0743298039|5.0|Wht is the purpose of reading? there are 2. education and entertainment. With fiction, the purpose is the latter. And with this book, there is not ONE second I was not entertained. Get it. read it. Enjoy.
B000063UR2|4.0|I bought this movie because it was one I had watched many years ago, I just remembered it being like a fairy tale but couldn't remember most of it. I bought it for my sister but had to watch it first. It was her favorite when we were younger. So, when I received the movie, it all came back to me. It truly is a magical movie, Tom Cruise seems very innocent & the beauty of the forest truly takes my breath away, it's enchanting. There were sad scenes, funny scenes, & scary ones. It's strange but movies that are made today just don't capture the magical feelings that come across when you are watching this movie. I would recommend this movie for sure.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Interesting twist on the oldest of the western tales.  Well acted, beautifully shot.  Icelandic locations add greatly to this film.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is a relaxed sound and I really look forward to listening to this.  It is easy enough to listen to at work but also uplifting enough to listen to at home as well.  I recommend it!
B000J103PC|4.0|This film isn't a lot like the book on which it is based, but I like both about equally.  The movie gives the main character, here played by Anne Hathaway, a much softer quality, which plays wells off of the hardness of Streep's character.  With its emphasis on the fashion world, it is fun to watch because there is always something interesting to look at.  Most people should enjoy the story because it's a kind of fairy tale gone wrong.  Streep's Miranda does steal the show, giving what could've been a one-dimensional character both the menace of a villain and a softness that doesn't quite let you hate her.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this Mini-Series, It takes time to get it right. Be prepared for a long day. My teen daughter and I love to have Pride and Prejudiced day now and then.
B000683VI4|5.0|Almost everyone loves this movie and it'll make even the most stoic person tear up a little.  If you haven't already heard about the story, you will not be able to predict what happens.  While a movie like this might have been considered a \\"chick flick\\" once, I've noticed that many young men proudly proclaim that they love it too.  In difficult times, this movie represents what everyone hopes to find: a fairy tale romance.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Without witnessing the Cirque du Soleil presentation, this album...er CD, loses half of its impact. What goes on between the ears after experiencing the show and then listening to it again is truly remarkable. I'd go to the show again in a heartbeat. Looking forward to the eventual remastering of the Beatles catalogue. This CD is just a taste of what is to come.
0679735909|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read.  It combines poetry, romance, and a detective story--what more could you ask for?  While the subject is academic, the prose is lively and engaging and you can't wait to see what will happen next.  It's like a literary \\"Da Vinci Code\\" without the continuous cheesy escapes.  If you are looking for a \\"romance novel,\\" then this isn't for you.  If you seek a thought-provoking work that will move you, then pick this up.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The transaction was fast and easy, and the product istelf was just as described and a very good DVD!

B000BW7QX6|5.0|Simply put, Serenity is the movie version of the TV series \\"Firefly.\\" It puts together all the loose ends that the series left dangling after only 14 episodes and nary a season (only 11 of these episodes were aired before being cut off.) In Serenity, we can see the arc of what \\"Firefly\\" could have been, and in my opinion, much more.<br /><br />Since Serenity is the movie and the culmination (?), it is only proper that it be given the cinematic touch. And yet, even on the big screen, its TV origin is still very apparent. The Firefly cargo ship Serenity is still as clunky as it was as shown in the tube. There's not much change in the costume, and even most of the sets still look like they've been picked up from the scrapyard. I am not saying this in disgust, but with affection because it is the characters that I have come to love after all. Come to think of it, there is something in Serenity that makes me think more of home than I would the Starship Enterprise. Perhaps this is one of the formulas that make the movie work. Like what I said in my review of \\"Firefly,\\" great science fiction doesn't have to be high-budgeted with wall to wall CGI (although it does help tremendously.)<br /><br />Most sci-fi films tend to take the genre into some mythical dimension. \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" is one such example of sci-fi that mixes myth and science in that it purports the human origin as having come from another planet (which is probably true.) \\"Star Wars\\" is another classic example in that it believes in a universal Force that is in all things, and that the right WILL triumph over the wrong. The Star Trek series, while primarily adventure-oriented, also sometimes have this tendency for the ethereal: note Spock's resurrection in the Star Trek film \\"The Search for Spock,\\" or even the Voyager satellite that achieved massive knowledge and became more than just a machine in Star Trek-The Motion Picture.<br /><br />\\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity,\\" on the other hand, beg to be different. In the Whedon `verse, aliens are conspicuously absent, there are no blackholes that threaten ships, no exploding stars, no technobabble to make things more \\"authentic,\\" no warping here and there, and no extinct alien civilization that leaves us mystified as to what might have caused their demise (Babylon 5.) Instead of all the above, we are given the gritty Frontier life in the outer edges of known space where the long arm of the Central law is not yet fully established. Sounds familiar? Fans of \\"Firefly\\" know that this has strong parallels with the American Western frontiers from two centuries ago. The Frontier overtones are so strong that even our heroes still carry guns, instead of the usual lasers. The captain himself wears pants that look like they came from the old American Civil War days of the 1860s.<br /><br />Enough said. The plot: Simon and River Tam, brother and sister, are on the run from the Alliance, the central government of the planets five hundred years from now. River was part of a mad experiment by the higher echelons of power that turned her (and maybe even others) into a kickboxing and mind-reading assasin. The siblings are hiding under the wings of the titular ship Serenity. Their destination: as far out as they can go. The ship is captained by Malcom Reynolds (the good-looking and therefore popular-among-women Mr. Nathan Fillion,) an embittered sergeant from the Independent Faction that once fought the Alliance for, well, Independence. On their tail is a nameless Operative, a superior speciman of an assasin, out to take River back at all costs. Of course, there's much more than what I had just said. Into the storyline are thrown a mixture of interesting characters such as a Companion (a certified pleasure-giver in the sexual way,) a Christian priest, a universal hacker and the loyal Serenity crew. Plus, who can forget the Reavers, for what would the fringes of space be like without them?<br /><br />Perhaps the thing that makes \\"Serenity\\" exciting is the way Captain Reynolds outwitted the frighteningly cool but ultimately disgusting Operative (played to perfection by Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor) not only once, but thrice. As a personal opinion, I like the fight scenes between these two the best. If romance can have electricity between two characters, so can a brawl between two fighters.<br /><br />As I have mentioned in my review of \\"Firefly,\\" the story of the Whedon `verse has much potential. I believe that many of you think that \\"Serenity\\" is a wrap-up of \\"Firefly.\\" Excuse me for saying that I just don't think this is so. For starters, I find it very hard to believe that Mal's broadcast of the SIGNAL can even slightly affect the tight grip of the Alliance government. But the underground movement is bound to be moved for sure, and therein lies another branch of story in the Whedon `verse. And what of the Reavers? They deserve better spotlight for what they really are. If Reavers get killed all the time, why does it seem like they're not diminishing? As for River, what is the real purpose of the Alliance for her? Why the ghastly experiments to create more dangerous assasins when Operatives could have done very well? Questions, questions, and further questions......., that is the potential of the Whedon `verse that I am talking about.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Serenity\\" is the worthy movie of \\"Firefly.\\" It should be for it is what Browncoats fans expect. For the Firefly-uninitiated, it will still pass as a very entertaining movie. Script is crisp and no nonsense. Jokes sometimes fall lame, but otherwise good-natured. Good story pacing and always commanding attention. Mr. Whedon's efforts to avoid plot cliches are very evident. Good CGI concept especially the scene where the Alliance and the Reavers spaceships come face to face beneath the ion cloud. The \\"Leaf on the Wind\\" sequence is also nicely done, and is one of the scenes that lift \\"Serenity\\" to a grander scale. But the Chinese they blurt out!! If Shakespeare were Chinese, he'd be turning in his grave right now!!<br /><br />Anyway, just sit back and enjoy this sci-fi flick. Sure, some people may not like it (a friend of mine didn't like \\"Firefly\\" but liked \\"Serenity\\",) because it really looks like a very B film. Plus, it doesn't have that mythical quality that most people yearn from the mysteries of space.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A slick bit of storytelling with some stand out acting.  The plot is fairly straight forward with all the misdirection coming from within instead of cluttering things up with a bunch of characters and sidestory.  The 3 main characters interact around an age old problem... love versus power.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the delivery of a satifying conclusion. A nice easy to watch flick perfect for a rainy afternoon.
B000E1MTXQ|4.0|I love bad puns. I try to avoid them but somehow, they keep pulling me back in. It was either that or \\"Bourne to Win\\" or even \\"The Wizard of Oz-Bourne\\" but now that's just being ridiculous.<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy is a fine action movie directed by Paul Greengrass that is notable for several reasons, chief among them being that the film cements Matt Damon's status as an action hero. The film ties into the Bourne Identity quite nicely and is paced in such a way that the viewer most likely will be out of breath by the end of the climactic car chase. Speaking of the car chase, it's right up there with the best ever and blows the chase from the first film completely out of the water. I'd say this film overall is just great fun with a top notch cast, great action and an even better storyline than it's predecessor.<br /><br />Universal's HD-DVD of the film is interesting to me for several reasons. The camerawork in the movie is shaky-cam of the highest order (I remember after the film came out, a few friends told me that watching it on the big screen made them slightly nauseous, especially during action scenes) and I think that this somehow makes the film appear slightly softer in HD and not quite as sharp as other HD pictures I've seen. In the moments where the film is still, that's when you can see just how crisp and clean the picture actually is. If you watch the fight scene in the house between him and the last remaining agent and then compare that to the scene where he is looking through the scope of a sniper rifle at Joan Allen's character, you'll see exactly what I mean.<br /><br />I'm not knocking the picture and I think it looks great overall, it's just an interesting look. Plus, the film favors a green tint much the way a film like Minority Report favored a kind of washed out blue. I don't know if this'll put anybody off but I didn't mind it too much.<br /><br />The sound is just fine and in scenes like the car chase, you get the surround speakers literally accosting you from all sides with screeching metal, gunfire and general mayhem. Definitely a speaker buster.<br /><br />Scene access is available during movie play as well as the special feature menu and this disc basically has the same list of bonuses as the standard DVD release. Basically you're covered because you get a lot of different features that are all very informative in their own right.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this HD-DVD. While it's not the absolute best looking HD title I've seen (and at the time of this writing, there's not many to compare to), it still looks excellent and has more features than you can shake a stick at.ers literally accosting you from all sides with screeching metal, gunfire and general mayhem.

While it's not the absolute best looking HD title I've seen (and at the time of this writing, there's not many to compare to), it still looks excellent and has more features than you can shake a stick at.   <br /> <br />
B000001Y5D|4.0|As you can see from some of my other reviews in here, my musical tastes are mired 30-40 years in the past.  Recently I jumped ahead to only 15 years behind the times at an unlikely place--the steps of Sacre Cour on Montmartre in Paris.  There on a unseasonably mild November Sunday afternoon, I listened to a Parisian troubador strum his guitar and sing  Beatles songs and American folk tunes (Simon and Garfunkel).  I started singing along and he invited me down to sing with him. First we did \\"Help!\\", on which we did our best to reproduce the Beatles echo singing style.  After \\"Help!\\" he started a song that I didn't recognize, so I sat back down on the concrete steps. \\"25 years and my life is still...\\"--I listened and enjoyed, and sang along with the \\"hey, hey, hey, what's goin' on!\\" chorus.  Later on he invited me back for \\"California Dreaming\\" (another echo song), but that's another story.<br /><br />Back in the US, I was determined to find out who did \\"What's Goin' On\\", which I was sure had to be the name of the song.  I Googled and searched lyrics sites--finding a lot of performers who had covered Marvin Gaye's classic tune.  Finally on page 3 of one search or another, I found a reference to \\"4 Non Blondes\\" and a song called \\"What's Up\\".  I read the lyrics and thought, \\"This might be it.\\"  I found 4 Non Blondes on You Tube and listened (and watched) Linda Perry sing the song.  I knew I'd found the song.  I also learned that the title of the song resulted from the ubiquitous presence of Marvin Gaye's song, and the need for 4 Non Blondes to be different.  I also learned was that Linda Perry did a lot better with the song than my Parisian friend, and I understood why it was a big hit that would be remembered in Paris 15 years later.<br /><br />Getting on with the story, I asked for 4 Non Blondes' CD \\"Bigger, Faster, Better, More\\" for Christmas.  Of all people, my 77-year old father found it for me.  Sure enough, my new favorite song was there, along with a several other songs featuring Linda Perry's unique vocal style--\\"Train\\", \\"Pleasantly Blue\\", \\"Morphine and Chocolate\\" and \\"Spaceman\\" being my favorites.  I love the way she can seemingly sing in two octaves at once.  \\"Morphine and Chocolate\\" has to be the theme song for a drug movie somewhere.  Mostly rockers, the 4 Non Blondes also blend in some blues and folk.  Linda's singing seems a little strident at time, but you can never accuse of her of holding anything back.  I've read comparisons of Perry's singing style to that of Robert Plant--they seem relevant. Both have great range of styles, pitch and that relentless emotion.ng Linda Perry's unique vocal style--\\"Train\\", \\"Pleasantly Blue\\", \\"Morphine and Chocolate\\" and \\"Spaceman\\" being my favorites.

B000ENC6XM|4.0|You know, when I first saw this movie I was kind of like, \\"Ahh, it was okay.\\" Since then it's grown on me. I'm not gonna tell you it's the best movie I've ever seen now but it's pretty cool when it's not too talky. I grew to like the characters introduced and I'm thinking that I'd like to see a sequel. I don't hate Keanu Reeves like so many others so I'd actually like to see him reprise the role again.<br /><br />That being said, Constantine now has the distinction of being the first HD-DVD I've purchased and I'm just here to say that this is a sweet little disc. The picture is extraordinary to say the least. It looks so good that it makes the scenes with shoddy special effects look.... well, shoddy.<br /><br />The sound is immaculate and the fact that you can access a wealth of special features as the film is playing just makes this whole new format awesome. Fans of the film will really appreciate this and I think even the casual fan would be impressed by this disc. I love the fact that you can go over the menus while the film is playing plus the fact that you can save your favorite scenes.<br /><br />So, while there aren't too many titles to choose from on HD-DVD as of yet, this one is worth the purchase. I think it makes a nice demo disc for your home theater and besides, I can think of far worse titles you can start off your HD-DVD collection with. Recommended!
B000AMPZF8|5.0|To preface this review - I have noticed a few comments and reviews, both here and elsewhere, comparing this album to 'Black Holes and Revelations' and suggesting that Origin of Symmetry is boring, repetitive, or merely represents an embryonic version of Muse's current sound.  With the greatest of respect, those sentiments reflect a failure to listen to this album with sufficient patience, a perspective on the point in time at which it was released, and a musically open mind.  Origin will not hit you with poppy, catchy songs like Revelations (although it has its catchy moments), but it is by far the more consistent album and will reward a serious listener with arguably Muse's best work so far. <br /> <br />Origin allowed Muse, previously a promising band often likened to Radiohead, to fully demonstrate the breathtaking scope of their sound and ambition.  Unlike the relatively dour and understated work of many of their contemporaries, Muse chose to mix the grandeur of classical music, metal, prog rock, and 'alternative' rock to create a massive, grandiose soundscape like no other.  Several of the tracks on this album include piano passages from Rachmaninoff; throughout one also encounters huge orchestral-type arrangements, spectacular organ, light-and-dark contrast of the kind not heard since the heyday of the Smashing Pumpkins, and some truly awesome falsetto singing.   <br /> <br />Ultimately though, this band is about intelligent guitar driven rock, and I doubt that there is a better current exponent of incendiary yet scientifically precise guitar playing than Matt Bellamy.  The songs on Origin provide ample scope for Bellamy's virtuosity, from riff-driven tracks like \\"Plug In Baby\\" to the massive stadium sound of \\"Citizen Erased\\" and the spanish-tinged guitar of \\"Darkshines\\"... and all of these are overshadowed by the use of the guitar as a hybrid classical-rock weapon of mass destruction on tracks such as \\"Microcuts\\" and \\"New Born\\".  Combined with an aggressive rythm section and Bellamy's razor-sharp voice, it's hard to remember that this band is a three piece in the face of the epic wall of sound it produces. <br /> <br />A brief comment on the content of the songs - although there are occasional deviations (for instance, the strange choice to cover \\"Feeling Good\\"), there is a definite dystopian-science fiction feel to much of Origin, although it is not a concept album per se.  Although musically different, thematically it is somewhat similar to At the Drive In's 'Relationship of Command', with tales of space travel, war, and totalitarianism.  Bellamy's penchant for this kind of imagery would become more obvious on subsequent albums, but here it provides a dark, intriguing backdrop. <br /> <br />So.  If you are looking for pop songs in the vein of Revelations' \\"Starlight\\" and \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" you may not enjoy this album.  If, however, you are interested in hearing possibly the best modern prog-rock album in existence, or what Radiohead might sound like if they put away their electronic equipment and picked up guitars again, buy this album - now.  A great musical experience beckons.
1558908358|5.0|Tron is a movie that will take your breath away.  It is a pioneer in computer animation, and provides a look that is unique.<br /><br />Besides the technical skills, I enjoy the movie because it deals with persecution of Christians.  Okay, maybe not Christians per se, but the computer programs that have faith in a user are treated like second class citizens.  As an area representative of Voice Of The Martyrs, I know this really goes on, though not inside the computer like Tron.

As soon as I heard Kiyosaki begin to speak about how to reprogram you conscious and subconscious mind with empowering thoughts about wealth, I knew he was the \\"real deal!\\" He definitely hits the nail on the head with his insightful and sensible approach to \\"having your money work for you!\\" I especially enjoyed the fact that he enables the reader by exposing the severely flawed financial paradigm of his \\"poor dad.\\" This is the paradigm that 90% of Americans unknowingly carry! This book is for everyone and is a fantastic tool that will get you into a better financial mindset. It also provides impactful and practical information without overwhelming you. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" will set you on the path of attracting financial prosperity and abundance into your life!<br /><br />- Dr. Matthew J.

B000HCO83Q|5.0|Since I am a big fan of the X-men sagas, I knew the 'final' installment would be as good as the first two if not better.  The cast members chosen for this movie fit each animated character to a T, except for Rogue's character whose southern accent is not heard in the movies.  I wish they will bring in Gambit, Jubilee, and other characters from the animated series. I like how the movie ends with a cliffhanger...who knows another X-men may be in the works.  I believe the next installment should deal with time travel to go back and expel the phoenix from Jean Grey's body.

There are parts that were over my head, but I was able to get the gist of the meaning.  I'm sure academics will love those parts.  Overall, a great, eye-opening, read.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|When the movie came out I fully intended to see it in the theatre but as so many of us I somehow got got up in getting ready for the Big day. I really am sorry I did not see it on the theatre screen but........it doesn't matter for it is as sweet and uncomplicated a movie as one would hope to see.   <br /> <br />The story is timeless with a story line that I can truly relate to as I am a child of the 50's.  Do be sure to make time for your children and in my case grandchildren to see this wonderful story and to remember the message of Santa's bell,  you won't be sorry, I promise.   <br /> <br />The music score is wonderful and the characters are so very life like - It's an old fashioned story produced with modern technological innovations. <br /> <br />This book shall go on my shelf right next to the other children's classic \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\"  Thanks Chris for taking your imagination to a wonderful place for children of all ages!!!!

8186336141|5.0|Don't let the title fool you, this is an excellent book on what is understood in the West to be Yoga. <br /> <br />The gem is really in the Beginner's Group. It is deceptively easy and yet the benefits are vast. If you have never done Yoga before, then the Beginner's Group is for you. You can't injure yourself doing it, and I suggest that (for beginners) you do ONLY the Beginner's Group for a whole year, and then move on to other parts. <br /> <br />I have read many Yoga books, and this book is now my menu of Yoga poses. <br /> <br />It is important to read the text very carefully and, if you are a beginner, to follow it exactly.

1883217040|5.0|An excellent presentation of Jazz theory, which whilst not essential to the enjoyment of Jazz, does provide a useful and well explained background to what is going on from the point of view of the construction and basic nuts and bolts of Jazz music.  Most of the examples quoted are from the post 1950s, and perhaps it would have been good to have some more of the earlier innovators, though in fairness to the author I am still working through the book and may have to \\"eat my words\\".  I would recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in Jazz. <br /> <br />RH
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I've been looking for something to replace my favorite television show the X-files and I think I found it. Supernatural is a very dark tv show with a internal family struggle. Great show! A must have if you are into anything scary.
B00026WUAU|5.0|With more time invested in the studio, this album might have been perfect. Then again it may have risked losing it's refreshing spontaneity in the process. As perfection is rarely found in this world, perhaps it comes down to achieving the best one can using whatever's available at the time. It's Dylan's gift for expression in his singing and writing I've appreciated more than just the music itself. I think sometimes it's better to have the raw material laid down in a listenable state than to attempt to produce a masterpiece that could lose it's initial spark in the re-working and polishing. Maybe due to pecuniary constraints, but this album was the result of minmal time in the studio. I remember hearing it on a balmy night at the beach, in my youth where I found myself transported by the urgency of it, a heady and intoxicating draught that completely captured my imagination. It does appear to have strong links to 'Desire' with it's swirling instrumentation and gypsy violin, although here, Dylan cuts a fresh path. Along with 'Saved', I would rate this as one of his most remarkable albums. I know that 'Blood on the Tracks' and 'Time out of mind' are both technically excellent but that's just another side (awful pun - sorry) of the wonderfully talented Bob Dylan. Street Legal is one of his most driven and passionate sounding albums and ought to be discerned for what is, not for what isn't. I gave it 5 stars because the sound quality has been **vastly** improved through remastering and now you can actually hear how great the band is too.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I own all Enigma CDs so far and I can say this is another excellent album from Michael Cretu, if you like Enigma you will like to have this CD as well.
B000002P5W|5.0|All in all I think this is the finest Hendrix studio work ever. Beautiful songs each with intricate guitar parts that if you listen carefully will blow you away, Yeah, I know She's So Fine drives people crazy, but like a small crack in a Ming dynasty vase, it really doesn't diminish the value. If you have any interest in Jimi, go buy this disc!!

0385040253|4.0|Depends on what you are looking for.  Ashley's book is the most complete compendium of knots I have ever seen and gets a 5 rating here.  It can be however, a little hard to follow learning to tie some of the knots. The descriptions can be minimal and language and old pen/pencil drawings are small and 100 years dated.  I still have not related the description and drawings of Tom's fool knot to being able to duplicate it. I bought the book to have fun with my daughter that we both learn some neat new knots, and it is \\"knot\\" working out well in this regard.  As far as a reference for improving the way I employ rope in everything else I do, it is unbeatable as far as giving one all the possible choices and ideas under the sun; most useful knots are fairly simple if you know they exist and their purpose.  I feel that I now own the \\"Holy Bible\\" of knots and that alone was worth the purchase.

0743289412|1.0|Three cheers for those who go out on top...unfortunately that was two or three novels ago for Stephen King.    The novel is an homage to King's wife; the story follows the widow of a famous writer.  This could have been a fun play on Stephen King's real life, but unfortunately fills the formula that King has frequently used of late - the first three quarters of the book is a generic pop novel that could end up being horror, crime drama, courtroom drama or anything else.  Only towards the end does King show us that this is in fact a horror novel - and by that time I had become disengaged with the story.    Over the years King has successfully employed several different writing styles: one novel written entirely as the inner thoughts of the protagonist, another purely character dialog.  In this novel, his twist is to give the main character unique expressions and vocabulary.  For example, in place of the f-word Lisey will say 'smuck,' as a war cry between Lisey and her husband they will speak of 'strapping it on.'  If used appropriately, he could have made this work.  The problem is that the expressions are used way too much.  'Smuck' is used in virtually every paragraph; I ended up wishing Lisey would either just say the f-word or leave it alone entirely.    Perhaps I've been spoiled by King's earlier novels with their early and sustained suspense (a la Cujo.)  Of Lisey's Story's 500 pages, only about 100 were suspenseful, and the book could easily have been cut down to 300 pages.  In summary, if Stephen King hadn't written this book my guess is that you, like myself, wouldn't be the least bit interested in reading it.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Loses the seriousness of its message in some hollywood goofiness but would recommend it
B00005JOLI|3.0|This movie could have been so great, and it ended up ruined. <br /> <br />I'll just run through the obvious reasons why it flopped. <br /> <br />Too short, but in this case that may have been a blessing due to many other factors. <br /> <br />No character development.  Seriously, switching between a few characters every 30 seconds is just not the way to do it.  It felt too much like the creators were just pulling stuff out of thin air for no reason other than filler.  The fight between Brom and Eragon came out of nowhere, when just a few seconds earlier they were in great danger.  How does that make any sense? <br /> <br />The story just went too fast.  LOTR in less than 2 hours, or at least that's what it felt like they were shooting for.  The viewer is given no time at all to identify, familiarize, or immerse themselves into story. <br /> <br />Low budget, and that's probably why it was so terrible.  The dragon looked fantastic, but we saw less of her than we should have.  And even less of Eragon riding her.  And what's with using character dialogue more than once?  Did they think viewers wouldn't notice?  Come on, now.    <br /> <br />Very, very bad choice of director.  Sorry, but a first-timer should not have even touched this movie.  No talent at all, and it shows.   <br /> <br />There is so much wrong with this movie, but it all boils down to no vision.  So little effort put into something that could have been a wonderful experience for both fans and newcomers alike.   <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is filled with poor choices and missed oppurtunities.  The only redeeming quality is the dragon, which is why I gave 3 stars.  If it weren't for her, this atrocity would have been a dead bore B-movie.   <br /> <br />Most likely the trilogy is cancelled because of the poor performance of this one.  But, if for some strange reason they decide to go through with it - everyone involved with this project needs to be replaced immediately and the entire thing shouldbe overhauled.  Better yet, just pretend like this movie didn't happen, and start from scratch.

B000K7UBTI|1.0|Iron Man is more of the same drab animation & is a bore to watch.  Why this film is getting such good ratings is beyond me.  Have these people watched the same movie?  I don't understand how these films continue to get so much praise.  Are peoples standards so low that this is exceptable to them?  When I think of stellar animation, I think Disney, Dreamworks, & Miyazaki.  This crap Marvel has thrown at us is uncomparable.  You say those are all top of the line studios, well Lions Gate wants you to believe that's what you're getting with these releases & that just isn't so. <br /> <br />I've wanted to love these movies so much everytime one has been released, but every time I've been disapointed & let down.  The animation isn't state of the art, to the contrary I'd call it little better than a Saturday morning cartoon.  The story again like \\"UA\\" 1 & 2 is horribly long & drawn out which is a shame.  Given the source material there's really no excuse for this to happen.  Like another reviewer has already asked \\"How do you screw up Iron Man\\".  Well in answer to that question, watch this & you'll see exactly that.  Avoid this movie & all the others & send Marvel & LionsGate a message that we don't like the sloppy rush jobs they're doing on our characters.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Many people do not like Al Gore (the moderator of this Doc) because of his political ideas and some terrible misstatements he has made (like saying he invented the Internet).<br /><br />Al Gore is not the creator of this Documentary nor does he act as an expert witness in this Doc.  He is the moderator only, someone presenting the story and showing facts and videos.  I think he was chosen for as moderator because he is an excellent speaker.  He stands steady; he doesn't gesture wildly; his speaking voice is clear.  The message in this movie is startling, it is an eye opener.  It did not need a scientist to be the moderator of \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\"  It took someone with good presentation skills.  Al Gore is not the issue here.  He is the presenter of the evidence (in this documentary) and he does an excellent job.  For the reviewers who saw this and commented at length about Mr. Gore, they are missing what this documentary is about.  This documentary is about global warming and has nothing to do with Al Gore's politics.<br /><br />About the Doc: it is very good and lays out evidence that is easy to follow.  Whether you believe or don't believe in global warming or Mankind's hand in it, you should see this Doc to as a piece of education.  Then, you be the judge.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have been a fan of John Mayer since his debut album, \\"Room For Squares\\".  When most groups nowadays get into their sophomore slump, nevermind their third release which is usually even worse than the second; John Mayer still comes out stronger than the last album. This is no exception. I can listen to all the songs on here over and over again, except for the Jimi Hendrix cover \\"Bold as Love\\". I deleted that one from my MP3 Player to make more room for other songs. If you don't have any John Mayer cds, I would say buy all three. If you only want to buy one, check this one out.

THERE ARE SO MANY IN DEPTH BOOKS ABOUT THEIR MUSIC ETC I WISH THEY WOULD SIT DOWN AND ANSWER SOME BASIC QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT THEY LIKE TO EAT, BOXERS OR BRIEFS, THAT SORT OF THING THAT THEY DO SO WELL AT HIDING. I'M NOT SAYING I WOULD LIKE EVERY DETAIL OF THEIR LIFE BUT SOME BASICS WOULD BE NICE. ALSO BEING FROM CLEVELAND I WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY OFFENDED THEY NEVER MENTIONED BEING INDUCTED INTO THE ROCK HALL.

B00005JOCU|4.0|I saw \\"Dreamgirls the day after I saw \\"The Pursuit Of Happyness\\" with Will Smith which I thought was one of the best movies in many years.<br /><br />Dreamgirls was almost equally satisfying for a totally different type of movie. A stellar magic moment in the middle of the movie by Jennifer Hudson will be remembered by this viewer for a long time to come. I wish the rest of the movie had some of that great impact, which probably is asking too much.<br /><br />Nice performances by Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy helped give nice credibility through most of the schmaltzy storyline and I thought Dreamgirls ran a little too long and could've cut 20 minutes (from it's 2 hours and 11 minutes) but all in all a really good movie!

0689865384|5.0|It's sort of interesting to read a children's book every now and then to sort of see how society is going and what kids are reading about. This book is a sort of satire like 1984 or Brave New World looking at a future society as a means of commenting on the present. Its odd because both 1984 and Brave New World were important books by two writers with a lot of runs on the board in terms of their literary careers. Both were important books in shaping the attitudes of the times in which they were written. One would have thought that it would be rather hard to do. However Scott Westerfield seems to have done it in an effortless way.  <br /> <br />The thing is of course to make a book about a future world is not something that in itself is going to get anyone to read it. There has to be some plot to generate some interest. In this case the author has had to keep children interested. The plot of this book involves a young girl who is raised in a future society and involves her just before a coming of age ceremony which will affect what she will later become. Some things happen to her which lead her to discover some disquieting things about what her future may hold.  <br /> <br />On a superficial level the book involved the adventures of the heroine Tally as she has to travel away from her city through an abandoned wilderness. The first message of the book is something of a dig at our societies and their unsustainability due to their use of fossil fuels. As Tally travels on her solar powered skate board she passes over the ruins of an old oil based civilization known to her people as the rusties. She lives in a self sustaining city which minimizes the use of minerals such as iron.  <br /> <br />As the book goes on the adventures continue and as a background to them there is a discussion of other things of significance to young people. The importance of physical beauty as compared to other things. The ways of dealing with conflict in society and how to balance individual liberty compared to the greater good.  <br /> <br />I found the book easy to read (well no surprise it is a children's book). However it is amazing the sorts of things they have in children's books nowdays. In my youth such books were generally escapist adventures which would touch on some children's issues. The ideas of not knowing one's place or how to deal with the world. The ideas of growing up and some notions of loyalty. However no one ever did real issues. No wonder children are so much smarter nowdays.  <br />
B000K4WPCC|3.0|COVENANT is a like a jet engine-equipped Volkswagen running on a Hot Wheels figure-eight track.  Looks cool.  Sounds cool.  But ultimately it doesn't really go anywhere.  According to the legend, five families sought and got vast magical powers, but at a price.  After they turn eighteen, the oldest males in those families got a lot of power, but they exchanged their youth for using it.  The trick is moderation, which a lot of the heirs to the power haven't been able to manage.  Also, it's interesting to see that the previous generation all seemed to settle down and have kids at about the same time.<br /><br />Renny Harlin is known for his action films (LEON:  THE PROFESSIONAL) and definitely delivers a stylish presentation here.<br /><br />THE COVENANT starts out with a creepy bang, then segues right into the high school pecking order problem that seems to be at the heart of so many of these films.  Enough conflict is generated right off the bat to keep the viewer's interest, but none of the characters ever become truly three-dimensional, seeming to exist only to keep the plot moving.  But the visual aspects of the film -- the color and the special effects -- work well enough that there's plenty of eye candy.  There are also plenty of shots of girls in underwear.<br /><br />The problems lie in a lack of true resolution at the end, breakout twists and turns of the plot, and too many coincidences.  One coincidence I had a problem with overall was that every heir to the power seemed to start a family at the same time.  I didn't know why all five heirs had to be in high school at the same time.  Even at the end, there's no feeling of closure.  THE COVENANT feels very much like the start of a franchise, and that's not good.  Franchises start best by being really good one-offs.<br /><br />THE COVENANT is primarily a guy's film.  Meant for male bonding.  Definitely not a date movie because there's just too much testosterone.  But the action is good, the girls are cute, and the cars are cool.  Some of the special effects, like the Mustang running into the eighteen-wheeler, are jaw-dropping.ute, and the cars are cool.

When I see most war-related movies, I usually feel like a spectator at an event that has nothing to do with me. But this movie was different; I was drawn in from the very beginning. By the end, I was sobbing uncontrollaby...not just for those who lost their lives, but for those who survived. How does one carry the memories of such a ride through Hell for the rest of their lives and not lose their sanity?

B000JVT092|5.0|Brandon Routh does a brilliant job replacing Christopher Reeves as Superman. While Christopher Reeves, for me at least, will always be the movie \\"Superman\\", Brandon Routh fills the role nicely in his place. The HD-DVD version has exceptional clarity and does high-definition DVDs justice. Since it's a combo disc, if you don't have a HD-DVD player yet, you can still enjoy the movie in with your reglar DVD player while being prepared for the HD revolution in DVDs (high definition) It's a definite must-see for any Superman fan. If you haven't seen the originals, watch Superman and Superman II (preferably the newly released Richard Donner cut) before watching this movie as this movie continues where Superman II ends rather than building on events after Superman V.

B000I2JKEC|4.0|Obviously this movie wasn't filmed in high definition since that technology didn't exist when it was made. However, it does provide better clarity.

In my opinion, the HD-DVD format will win the format battle between HD-DVD and Blu-Ray.

0739316443|2.0|I received the abridged audio version as a Christmas gift.  Maybe I should blame the abridgment, but it was about the least-thrilling thriller I've ever come across.  I listened to the entire set of CDs fairly quickly, in several days of my lengthy commute, and kept expecting there to be an increase in tension... especially when \\"the chase\\" started. Instead, it was a rather placid description in which everything goes along almost uneventfully and without a hitch, with basically no real threat to the protagonist.  <br /> <br />Not a \\"bad\\" book; just boring.  <br /> <br />There's also a puzzling \\"continuity\\" glitch, relating to the substantial amount of money the protagonist has for the initial part of his escape. Maybe the explanation got lost in the abridgment.

I really like the laid back songs - a nice departure for both, very pleasing (which is why I gave it two stars instead of no stars) however, the production quality leaves a LOT to be desired. The sound is just not up to par. This is a studio CD folks, not unplugged live, and there simply is no excuse for the clear lack of quality. Fire the engineer, use another studio next time. They killed what could have been an otherwise enjoyable CD.
0920668364|5.0|Wonderful book. It's just a beautiful treasure for children to own.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I saw a trailer for this on some other DVD and the trailer left me wanting more.  But after that, I heard very little about the movie.  Then, I just happened to see it at Target.  Well, I have thrown away plenty of good money over the years just buying DVDs brand new without watching it beforehand.  So, I went to Hollywood video and picked it up used for about $8.00.  All I can say is that it was one of the best movie purchases I have made in a long time.  <br /> <br />I'm no professional reviewer (as you can tell from my other reviews) but this movie grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go.  It takes a bunch of high school kids and throws them in an adult situation.  A kid's ex-girlfriend is found dead and he wants to find out whodunit.  That's the movie's premise.  But the path from Point A to Point B is a twisted one full of quick dialogue and beautiful camera shots.  I had to watch it with the subtitles on so I could catch everything that was said.  The way the movie bounces around and has several interesting characters reminds me of a Tarantino movie.  I'm no expert in the film noir genre as the review by Amazon states this movie is, but if this is what the genre holds, I will become a fan.  I'm not going to go into the plot of the movie because other people have done that already, so go read their reviews if that's what you want.  It's a strong film with a hardly-known cast.  Some of them will look familiar to you, but you probably won't remember where you have seen them.  All of the performances are solid and not put aside by a big-named star like other films auffer from.  The movie seems like a cross between Clerks (for its quick dialogue--although not humorous like Clerks--and independent feel), a Tarantino movie (for its unique characters) and L.A. Confidential (for its crime and plot.)  If I haven't bored you to sleep, get in your car, hop the bus or walk to the closest place to find this movie and grab it.
B0006399FS|2.0|U2 did not sell out like a lot of people thought, with the recording of POP - here is where it is.  This was the same concert, same songs as \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" which is in my opinion their VERY BEST.  After they achieved their best, now they are remixing their old stuff and selling reguritated TRASH.  They've lost it.  Bono has lost the ONE TRUE GOD because to Bono, BONO IS GOD.  He has no idea what he is ushering in, at least I believe he is oblivious to being a pawn of Satan.  Hey Bono -- wake up DEAD MAN.  But try waking up into a RENEWED LIFE and let the \\"old man\\" die to Christ.  Until you do that you are going to keep on sucking.  U2 is OVER.  It was a good thing up until this albulm.  Now they are releasing remixes and B.S. because they don't know what to do with themselves.  They achieved all they could on \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" and are ironically dragging that around like old baggage into every concert and performance and record release SINCE then.<br /><br />Bono - the GOVERNMENT will never save us you BONE HEAD.  GET BACK TO JESUS MAN - HE IS THE ONLY REAL SAVIOR, THE WAY THE TRUTH THE LIFE.  You obviously still haven't found what you are looking for because you are looking in the wrong place.  Can you guys read?  Pick up a Bible and read it instead of having someone TELL YOU THE STORIES BONO.  \\"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the Name of the Lord\\" ... He has taken all of your ability to create away for a reason, and that is that you left him behind, the ONE that you should have learned in \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is the ONLY ONE you CANNOT LEAVE BEHIND.  I hope you read this, I doubt you will, but before you keep going in circles and everyone else realizes it too, you better check back at WHO you left behind.<br /><br />For the people who like U2, this rehash of the last recording is not as good, but it's okay, but from here U2 goes down like a fizzling slow atomic bomb that unfortunately was NOT dismantled.  This albulm is all about how a good band became dismantled because of Who they left behind.  They set themselves up on a pedastal, and have a long, long way we will all be watching them fall down if they don't realize what is happening to them.ed.

1569242739|5.0|I love love LOVE this book.  The recipes are simple and perfect, every time; I have had VCTOtW for about a month and a half now, and despite at least weekly bakings, haven't had a single recipe fail yet. Not one. Since I bought it I seriously can't stop baking and am beginning to fear for my waistline!<br /><br />I would like to second another reviewer who pointed out that the recipes don't ask you to use egg replacers or other \\"substitutions\\" common in vegan baking (usually because someone is trying to veganize a non-vegan recipe); instead, the recipes are just designed vegan from the ground up, and call for simple ingredients that anyone would have (oil, baking powder, etc.).  Also, there are tons of beautiful color pictures of finished cupcakes throughout, which is one of the most important things about a cookbook, to me.  Then, too, they suggest enough variations on each cupcake recipe (there's 6 suggested ways to dramatically alter the chocolate cupcake recipe alone) that this book will keep you occupied for quite a long time.<br /><br />Since every baker likes a little external validation, here's mine: I have gotten absolute raves on every cupcake I have made so far, and most of these raves were from non-vegans who were comparing my vegan cupcakes with regular [non-vegan] cupcakes.  For example, last night I fed a chocolate cupcake with cookies 'n cream frosting (vegan buttercream frosting with Newman's O's mixed in... this is a recipe from the book, obviously) to a friend who didn't just enjoy it, but was absolutely WOWED.  \\"Geeze, it's amazing what they're doing without dairy or eggs these days; these are better than regular cupcakes\\" was one comment that I particularly appreciated because most vegan desserts can taste good, but in my experience it's the rare vegan dessert that can taste identical or even BETTER than the regular omni thing.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, vegans and omni's alike, because even if you're not vegan (or lactose intolerant), the cupcakes taste fabulous.  The recipes are so simple they're basically idiot-proof, and I have seriously never in my life had better chocolate cupcakes than the ones I made from this book: moist and fluffy and ooh... just perfect.  And I'm not even a chocolate person.<br /><br />Anyway, do yourself (and everyone in your life who will be eating your baked goods) a favor and buy this wonderful book!  I'd give it 10 stars if they'd let me...akes taste fabulous.

B0000399WI|5.0|...from my point of view. I generally don't care much for this type of story, and anything with \\"redemption\\" in the title generally steers me away. Then my wife convinced me to watch it, and it is now one of my favorites! <br /> <br />Convicted criminals make unlikely sympathetic protagonists--but some of them, at least, are still human beings, and remain so in spite of the circumstances. This film contrasts them with the hypocrisy and brutality of those in authority and power over them. In some ways, it is a study of how easily and thoroughly power corrupts. <br /> <br />It is also the story of how one man uses his brain to make a positive difference in his circumscribed world, and ultimately triumph over the hypocricy and corruption that keeps him in prison, even though proof of his innocence is discovered. This film will inspire you to deal with the entrenched stupidity and hypocricy all to common in today's world. <br /> <br />All of the actors deliver excellent performances, anchored by Morgan Freeman, who's character is the narrator.

B000G7PMD2|4.0|DT is GREAT live - very tight, very exciting (with the possible detraction of LaBrie's flat vocals on a few albums). Score is no exception and LaBrie's voice is top notch on every track here. The attraction of this album is that it's an anniversary concert, with the addition of an orchestra. I think it fails to inspire on both of those counts however - I'll elaborate:<br /><br />1)Anniversary Concert: I know DT (especially Portnoy)is rabid about not playing the same songs live every night, and never playing the same set in the same city twice - and for this they are to be commended. Some bands release several live albums over the course of their careers featuring the same hit songs - what's the point? Every DT live album is unique in this sense and that's why there are so many live releases compared to other artists. HOWEVER: On a 20th anniversary CD, you would expect to find some of the more obvious songs such as 'Pull Me Under', or 'Burning My Soul'. Instead, the setlists (particularly the 2nd disc) jumps around a bit too much and isn't very cohesive. Six Degrees is a great choice on Disc 2, and Disc 3 featuring Octavarium and Metropolis make sense, but Disc 1 and the remaining tracks on Disc 2 leave me scratching my head a bit -mainly because:<br /><br />2) They feature an orchestra. I was worried at the outset of the Six Degrees overture (Disc 2 track 1) which begins the 20 minute song on a shaky leg. They are not tight at all - particularly the string section. Some of the runs here sound like a car wreck, their timing is terrible, and I believe I even hear a few horns that are out of tune. This is remedied however once the band kicks in on 'About to Crash' at which point the orchestra seems to disappear completely. This is probably the most terribly mixed metal band/orchestra combo album I've ever heard. As others have mentioned, the low strings are nonexistent, and the the rest of the symphony is covered up by Rudess' keyboards. The orchestra does shine on the quiet tracks such as 'Goodnight Kiss' and 'Solitary Shell' - but once Petrucci and Portnoy start doing thier thing, the orchestra may as well have left the building. At least it covers up their helter skelter timing and tuning problems. Hopefully for the 30 year anniversary concert DT go with Michael Kasdan (Metallica S&M) and a certifiable symphony like Boston or San Francisco. This was a bit of a waste sonically and financially I'm sure. Why didn't the setlist play to the strengths of a string section? Where is 'Under a Glass Moon', or 'Peruvian Skies'? I've been dying to hear these tracks with a full orchestra. Instead, we get 'Vacant' - why bother?<br /><br />All that being said - get this album. It is expansive and extremely enjoyable, just don't expect to hear the orchestra much - and don't expect much when you do.<br /><br />Here's to another 20 years to the greatest prog-metal band in the world!the quiet tracks such as 'Goodnight Kiss' and 'Solitary Shell' - but once Petrucci and Portnoy start doing thier thing, the orchestra may as well have left the building.

B0013ND36G|4.0|I'm probably going to lose instant credibility by saying this, but I think that T3 is the best in the series. Yes, T2 and the original are brilliant but T3 is simply all action from start to finish. It's a breathless, relentless thrill-ride that doesn't let up until the shocking, refreshingly downbeat climax.<br /><br />Nick Stahl easily steps into the role of John Connor, vacated by Eddie Furlong and surpasses him in terms of acting and character development. T3 takes place over a couple of days but the actors still get enough out of the sudden, fast-paced plot developments to prevent them from simply being furniture. I was surprised at how emotional and engaging Nick Stahl's performance was as I had previously thought he was totally inappropriate for the part.<br /><br />T3 has Connor as some sort of Ronin type character, living separate from the rest of humanity, paranoid that Skynet may be able to track his footsteps in the future and send a Terminator to kill him. He knows he destroyed Cyberdyne and everything SHOULD be okay, but something else just stops him from keeping in touch with the world. Plus Sarah Connor is dead, leaving a John alone in an unstable time.<br /><br />Computer networks are failing across the planet and there seems to be a giant ghost in the machine. Everyone seems oblivious to the brewing trouble until the T-X and the T-800 step out of the time displacement field, hellbent on blowing each other and the city to smithereens.<br /><br />Amazing special effects, stunt work, and non-obnoxious CGI make up the rest of the movie, which is essentially one huge chase. I found it to be pretty seamless when I first saw it but upon repeat viewings you can tell what's fake and what's not. But only if you look really hard. T3 uses its effects to make a good movie, not a video game cut-scene. Something that so many shallow effects movies do.<br /><br />Of course there are problems. As always in a film with such a white-knuckle momentum, plot coherence is sacrificed for timing. Why are Kate Brewster and her boyfriend shopping in the middle of the night? How on Earth would Connor's Lieutenants have survived Judgment Day when they clearly live in the middle of LA and would have been fried to a crisp? There are also some continuity problems with the first 2 movies not the least of which are the wildly incorrect character ages. But even James Cameron himself didn't define this too clearly in T2. And why is Arnie's Terminator model now called a T-101? He's a T-800: Cyberdyne Systems Model 101. A couple of quick exposition scenes could have made all this nice and neat. But they couldn't be bothered I guess. This is probably why so many fans of Cameron's entries turned their noses up that T3. I suspect that many of these complaints WERE actually detailed but cut from the film.<br /><br />Terminator ends here as far as I am concerned. The 2009 T4 from McG was a travesty, and the TV series was almost unwatchable. Arnie was 55 when he shot this film, and looks very good for his age. Though it was, and will likely remain, his last true hit as a headlining actor.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks great in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen with a curiously non-HD Dolby 5.1 soundtrack (why is there no DTS HD-MA?).

Did I have enough; were there too many; did it enhance the sentence or convey the wrong idea. After reading and chuckling through that chapter I am glad to say that I am comfortable with my \\"Commas Level\\" though not an expert. <br /> <br />Ever wonder what the difference was between a colon and a semi-colon?? A dash and a hyphen??? If you never have than maybe this book isn't for you but if you were like me who was self conscience of his writing but not wanting to read reams of dissertations on the subject you have found the right book. (Wonder if I could have used a comma in that sentence, hmmm.) <br /> <br />2 Warnings: 1) Ms. Truss is British and so is her humor. 2) In a graduate course that I took the instructor was very PC and had a problem with the statement using the \\"N\\" word found on page 51. <br /> <br />Yes, this book was required reading for a graduate track and it was great!! <br /> <br />I wish I had this book for my senior year in High School 45 years ago. <br />
0307165485|5.0|This book is a walk down memory lane for me as it is the exact facsimile of one I had when I was seven years old which unfortunately went missing over a few house moves etc. It is a wonderful compendium of all the classic Scarry stories and illustrations - as a child I spent many happy hours poring over every page.  I highly recommend this to adults for nostalgia purposes and to parents and children as a lovely childhood experience to treasure.
B000H30B2C|2.0|Despite its flaws I am a big fan of Peter Jackson's three hour overproduced, overblown version of \\"King Kong\\".  Being an owner of the two disc version of the original theatrical cut I have to say this three disc version isn't really necessary. <br /> <br />First of all the extended scenes don't really add anything to the story.  We see enough weird creatures in the original cut attacking the hunting party that we don't need to see a another attack by a dinosaur nor do we need to see a giant swamp creature attacking the rescue party.  Not that these are bad scenes.  They are just kind of there. <br /> <br />Now there is a scene towards the end of the movie in which a military guy gives an awful speech, \\"This town was created by humans for humans and I am not gonna let some dirty ape destroy it\\" Blah blah blah.  This was a bad scene and should have been included in the deleted scenes. <br /> <br />Speaking of the deleted scenes, most of them are on the boat ride. Had Jackson including them the running time of King Kong would have been closer to four hours with at least another half an hour on the already long boat ride.   <br /> <br />As for the \\"Making of\\" documentaries:  If you've seen the extended versions of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies you might find these documentaries seem redundant.  And at almost every turn of production the phrase, \\"This movie alone was much harder than all three 'Rings' movies combined\\".  That is said about the building of each set, Andy Serkis acting as King Kong, and well, so many times I figure it to be hype. <br /> <br />If you are a big fan of this flick just stick with the two disc version.  The only reason to buy this is the movie is presented on two discs giving the movie a higher bit rate.
B00005QW5X|5.0|PURE entertainment! Not for kiddies though unless you want to answer a few questions! Do yourself a favor and see it at least. Bought this after renting it. Had to have it for some reason;-) Just like I needed Rocky Horror, however, this is better!

1572814349|5.0|This was the first tarot deck that I ever bought. Each card is a beautiful collage of medieval/renaissance artwork that is done in such a way that it looks like an original painting from that time. The symbolism itself is in the spirit of the Rider-Waite deck. The little book that comes with it is very good for gaining insight into the symbols' meanings. I highly recommend this deck for anyone interested in the Tarot at any experience level. If you want the popular symbolism of the Rider-Waite deck and you feel a strong connection to artwork from the medieval/renaissance periods, then this is the deck for you. All of my readings with the deck (after the first few clumsy tries) have been very insightful and accurate to a degree I did not expect.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This season's opener is one of the best episodes of SHOCK TV to hit the small screen.  My only regret was that there were so many re-runs shown during this season, I waited to buy this off of Amazon when it came out and watched it for the first time. I have to say, it was clearer and sounded better than watching on the broadcast networks. There is also a host of great information on the bonus features that made this well worth it. If you liked the first season, you'll love this. BUY IT!
B0000047EC|5.0|I often return to this recording.  It's simply sublime.  The interplay between the players is beyond words, and the last song \\"Spiritual\\" is just that.  Gives me goose bumbs everytime I hear it.  A great record for falling asleep to, or having a quiet evening with someone you love.  I can't recommend it enough. I'm not a huge fan of Pat's 80's new agey sounding stuff, but \\"Beyond the Missouri Sky\\" is amazing.  I've enjoyed several Charile Haden records as well.  I can't believe that this record is buried as cd #38 on amazon when one types in Pat Metheny.  To me it should be the first one up, even before his first three records.
B000AARKOO|4.0|This movie, despite what some say, is historically accurate.  The action is intense and Orlando does a great job in his traditional - ancient roles. The animation/CG is excellent and the acting is overall very good. Good musical score as well, but the story does tend to lag a little in parts.  <br /> <br />If you liked Gladiator and Lord of the Rings, mixed with a little bit of history, you'll love this one.  If a movie has to be non-stop action, you'll probably get bored.
B00005JPGM|4.0|\\"Blood Diamond\\" may well result in the biggest boon yet for the cubic zirconium business.  This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.<br /><br />\\"Blood\\" diamonds, also known as \\"conflict\\" diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars.  Set in 1999, the movie features Leonardo DiCaprio as a largely amoral diamond smuggler who is plying his trade in war-torn Sierra Leone on the west coast of the African continent.  Through a series of complicated events, Danny Archer meets up with a native named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who knows the whereabouts of a rare, priceless diamond that Archer, along with virtually everybody else in the film, would love to get his hands on.  Solomon, however, needs its as a bargaining chip to ransom his wife and children who have been turned into refugees as a result of the internecine war occurring between the government and rebel forces out to enslave people like Solomon in the local mines.  Jennifer Connelly plays a compassionate American reporter determined to expose the evil and corruption involved in the blood diamond business to a largely apathetic and hitherto unresponsive world at large.<br /><br />With a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film.  One could object to the fact that, yet again, a story set in the Third World seemingly needs to be told through the eyes of white people from the West.  The movie tries to overcome this handicap by making it clear that Archer is actually from Zimbabwe - and DiCaprio has the South African accent to prove it - but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless.  Still, given the sad fact that such an approach was probably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers.  The movie also indulges in a few too many action movie cliches - hairbreadth escapes, in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the near-miraculous dodging of bullets etc. - but, again, the moviemakers clearly know they must first get the attention of their target audience before they can enlighten them about the situation at hand.  Moreover, the film is a bit too long at 138 minutes and suffers from attenuation and repetition in its final half hour.<br /><br />Those negatives aside, \\"Blood Diamond\\" is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial moviemaking, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de-humanization.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't stint in showing us the brutality and widespread individual suffering brought about by this mad rush towards profit and greed.  In addition, Archer's slow awakening to the depths of the human tragedy occurring around him and his own shameful participation in it may be predictable from a narrative standpoint, but it gives the film the moral weight and thematic depth it needs to elevate it above the level of a mere exploitative action picture.ably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers.

B0002STNQ2|4.0|This book starts kind of boring. Many people might've put it down. But the way he writes it... Makes the reading interesting. It just got better and better as you read it. I kinda like this book.     Well, the microtechnology described  in this book might actually be invented someday, but not today. Maybe in 2020? Anyway, these little swarms could be used for military to kill off enemy bases pretty fast! But then, it went out of control, so I guess that's a risk that people have to think about: SECURITY.
B000GY729M|2.0|The only two good tracks on this record are the radio hit \\"When You Were Young\\" and \\"Uncle Jonny.\\"  Other than that, I think the album was a pretty weak effort.  If you want to hear a good 2nd album of a band that came out about the same time, check out Keane's brilliant follow-up to \\"Hopes and Fears,\\" \\"Under the Iron Sea.\\"
0446310786|5.0|This is the story about a girl in the 1930s, named Scout. As she grows, learns about the evilness of the world such as racism, stereotypes, gossips, unfairness, etc. by observing her surroundings.    I do not like this book that much, but 5 stars is definently deserved of this great work. Very well-written, and of course, a classic.
B000G75AE8|5.0|What can I say...this album rules. From the opening track (Flesh Storm) I was head banging, and hooked. The Band can create a very dark and cool ambiance. Then the solos hit you and your like wow. If your not angry and you listen to this album you will be, you'll just wanna hit somthing. I may say that it's better than Reign In Blood
B0002F6BRE|4.0|When an SNL movie comes out, I always worry that it's going to have a few \\"good bits\\" in it but struggle as far as genuine narrative is concerned.  Take \\"LADIES MAN,\\" for instance.  \\"ELF\\", on the other hand, rocked.  It's both genuinely funny and sweet. It does have two problems, however.  I think if they had a second chance to do this movie, they would get rid of the \\"gross bits\\"--the long Coca-Cola burp, the drunken mailrroom romp, the eating of used chewing gum--and play up the elfin stuff like the snowgunslingering, the bond between brothers, the Elf's really sweet tooth, his sweet infantile love for his father, and give us more of Bob Newhart's very touching Papa Elf.  The second problem is the very weak, overly theatrical nonsense at the end with Santa's sleigh and the singing (off-key!)in the park.  I know they needed to somehow conclude the movie, but that ending was childish--I think they lost the adults in the audience on that one.  On the whole it is still a movie I watch every chance I get--I just shut it off right before the end.
B000HCO83G|5.0|Whether you're an X-Men fan or just an action fan in general, this is a great one.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|To be honest, I wasn't looking to buy this.  I've never been a huge Eagles fan.  In fact, the reason I own Hell Freezes Over is because when I bought my DVD player it was one of the few high quality concert DVDs available.  It was impressive, both in sound and performance, and definitely gave me a new appreciation for the band. <br /> <br />But, as I said, I still wasn't looking to buy this DVD.  I just happened upon it at Wal-Mart, and it was just too good of a buy to pass up (under 10 bucks), WITH a bonus CD!  So I bit.  I was a bit skeptical, because let's face it, those vocal parts are pretty high and those voices are now pushing 60 years of age. I've heard many ageing rockers that just can't get up there anymore. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a wonderful concert.  It's 2 1/2 hours long, it's well recorded, both sound and picture wise, and the 5.1 surround is actually utilized much better than Hell Freezes Over was.   <br /> <br />Does this mean that this concert DVD is better than HFO?  In a word, no.  First, I think the excitement of the '94 reunion rubbed off on both the audience and the performers.  Secondly, I think the sound is warmer on HFO, as that was recorded under almost studio like conditions.  And even though Felder's replacement is a pro, and no doubt a more versatile and accomplished guitarist than Felder, I still miss his presence.  He was a full-fledged band member, and a sideman, no matter how talented, is still a sideman.  Also, even though the vocals on this DVD were still OK, I think that they've all lost a bit of their vocal power and range, with the possible exception of Joe Walsh.  They can still hit the notes, but not with the power and quality that they displayed on Hell Freezes Over.  Also, at least three of the backing musicians sing along with almost all the backing vocal parts.  On HFO, it was all Eagles and nothing BUT Eagles singing. <br /> <br />But don't get me wrong here.  I am not criticizing this release.  It's top-notch,and I think it's admirable that they do as well as they do, considering their age and the fact that most singers of their vintage could not pull it off with the panache that they do.  It's just that they ARE showing their age, particularly with the vocals.  It's subtle, but when you listen to the songs that are common to both the HFO and Farewell Concert 1 back to back, it is noticable. <br /> <br />So enjoy 'em while you can, I say.  These guys are consumate professionals, and I'm sure that when they can't cut it anymore, they will not comprimise their show or their name, even for boatloads of money.  This is a great concert by a great band.
0066620996|5.0|This and Built to last are by far the best business books out there. Any person looking into starting their own business should read these books. Just perfect.
0060536357|5.0|If you love big business on Wall Street, you'll love this book!  Barbarians at the Gate is a must-read story of the most spectacular private equity buyout in history.  It details the rise of two great American companies: RJ Reynolds tobacco, and Nabisco.  The story develops to encompass the rise of KKR, Wall Street's most powerful private equity firm, and how a clash of egos sent Wall Street's most cunning investment firms into a battle for ownership of RJR Nabisco.<br /><br />While this book covers a nonfictional piece of Wall Street history, it by no means reads like a history textbook.  Like a good novel, focus on the personalities of major players like Ross Johnson brings a human element to the story.  What makes the book entertaining is how the authors have pieced together their interactions; humor and interesting dialog keep you reading.  Also nicely written is how the parallel companies and characters clash together into the LBO climax.<br /><br />To me the greatest accomplishment of this book is the level of detail that Bryan Burrough and John Helyar have recreated.  No part of this book is fabricated or enhanced for enjoyment; every page is based on information obtained by personal interviews with the actual people involved in the deals.  It's a journalistic masterpiece.<br /><br />This is a great book for anyone interested in the investment banking field.  In particular, business students will benefit the most.  The conflicts of interest involved in this takeover provide good thoughts on ethics and business decisions.  The impact of 1980s figures that shaped Wall Street today such as Shearson-Lehman or Michael Milken are evident.  Barbarians at the Gate puts you in the boardroom with the executives behind the deals.<br /><br />The big picture: Barbarians is superbly written from page 1 to the end of the epilogue.  Read it because you will not only be well informed, but entertained.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Of the three movies in the sequel, this one I would rank as the worst.  It felt like the producers were in a hurry to come to some sort of a conclusion.  The portrayal of Jean Gray as the burgeoning Pheonix was weak and this terminal act was too succinct in it's development.  I also thought that the mutant powers went way over the top compared to what they had been previously.  Overall, an average sci-fi / superhero movie.  <br /> <br />I will say, however, that because I loved the comic book series and the cartoon, I still hold a special place for this whole trilogy.  If you are like me, buy it.  If you're not sure, rent it.

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|This second release is a bit more commercial than the self titled debut but it is still great. Memorable hooks, emotive lyrics, and just enough of a progressive vibe to keep things interesting. I don't usually listen to pop rock (I am more of a fan of the underground) but this band caught my ear. Their overall package is presented well and the musical vision is well executed. <br />Highly Recommended.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Like a fine wine, they boys of Incubus seem to get better with age.  I wasa huge fan of A Crow Left of the Murder, enjoying every song on the album.  While this new album has a few tunes I could do without, the good songs far overshadow the few the fall short. <br /> <br />Dig - Great song, one of those that grabs you the first time you hear it. <br /> <br />The other great songs on the album are: <br /> <br />Anna Molly <br />Love Hurts <br />A Kiss To Send Us Off  <br />Earth To Bella (Part 1) <br />Oil And Water  <br />Diamonds And Coal  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004ZD69|2.0|I held off for years before buying this intriguing piece of music, only to discover that I had made a big mistake ... not in waiting so long, but in buying it whatsoever.<br /><br />Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., once submitted this two word review of Joseph Heller's novel Something Happened: \\"Nothing does.\\" After reading one flattering review after another of this disc and this band, I placed disc one in my player with great anticipation of the layer upon layer of swelling musical ideas that would build up to powerful summit after powerful summit. Alas, what I hear is Hearts-of-Space-ish chord washes and minimalist instrument progressions that -- just when the drums kick in and the guitar gets a little noisy and a slight bit of hummable melody introduces itself -- sadly, slithers back into ten more minutes of aimless droning.<br /><br />So many other musicians do longform musical ideas so much better -- seek out live Praxis, or even At War With Self and the Gordian Knot discs. Godspeed You Black Emperor may be sexy on paper, but in the reality of my headphones it is a veritable plain Jane.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|If you are a fan of WW2 movies in general and a fan of Das Boot in particular then this is a must have DVD. For those that have never seen this movie, it provides a very insightfull glimpse into the German side of the war. It is, in my opinion, one of the better war pictures ever made, from a human stand-point. The un-cut version of this movie is the definative version. This is not for the faint of heart. The un-cut version is just short of 6 hours long. Fans of this movie will love all the extra insight to life aboard a German U-boat. It can get a little slow at times. However, if you have never seen the this picture then I reccomend that you get the Directors cut version. It is much shorter and covers most of the action, but fails to really get into the human drama which makes this movie so great. The great thing about this movie is that it takes the viewer along for the ride. You are there inside the u-boat experiencing all the tedium, the terror, the horror and the excitment that the real crews must have felt. If you are a WW2 buff then I highly reccomend this movie.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|In all honesty I expected \\"Love\\" to be yet another re-packaging of tried and true Beatles classics. Then I heard that it was actually the soundtrack to a Cirque du Soleil show and my expecations dropped even lower. I expected nothing short of total cheese. Wow was I surprised. My review? One word. AWESOME! <br /> <br />Give it a listen. If nothing else it's really cool to listen to.
B00000ILDE|2.0|I just bought the Alien trilogy and began watching them starting with the first film.  The original Alien was just as good as I remembered from my childhood days.  The atmosphere and suspense is simply unmatched by this, the second movie.   <br /> <br />From what I remembered from the second movie I was expecting much of the same suspense and creepiness but what I found was a cast of predictable if not altogether annoying characters.  Paxton plays the \\"hothead marine\\"(one of the most annoying of the characters), there is a \\"tough as nails\\" drill sergeant and a \\"tough as nails\\" woman marine who don't take no crap from nobody etc etc...Their antics hold up well with the general atmosphere of the movie which is akin to a Terminator movie rather than the first Alien film.  Overall I felt the acting was forced.  The first film didn't try to give much depth to the characters which was great.  This film tried too hard to make me feel sorry for characters or dislike characters...but I guess if Cameron didn't try to do this he really didn't have much else in the film that would draw my attention.  Basically by the end of the film I wanted the aliens to kill everyone so I didn't have to listen to any more predictable, shoddy dialogue.  <br /> <br />I was surprised that this film recieved all the rave reviews that it did considering its far departure from the first.  I, for one, will take the original film any day over this one.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|Pretty good album. Not as good as the first one by any means.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|This CD offers the best of Dylan, and more. It should be a best-seller.
B000HCO840|5.0|This X-men movie, like the previous two, was excellent. Brett Ratner did an excellent job, and I doubt very seriously the director who left for Superman could have done any better. It was packed with action and a little bit of romantic overtones. Breath taking effects dominate the film. <br /> <br />I think X-men is the BEST movie franchise because in addition to having literally hundreds of built in scripts (comic books) to choose from, unlike most comic book franchises it has many, many characters which can be rotated in and out (i.e. Nightcrawler, Beast, Gambit, Jubilee etc etc) just as was done in the comics as new students joined the schools over the years. As such I think it would be very foolish to stop here. There should be at very least TEN (10) X-men movies. Heck, there are going to be 6 or 7 Spider-man movies, so we hear, and that is only 1 character (as great as he is). <br /> <br />FOR HARD CORE FANS ONLY**** <br />The ONLY criticism I have (being a Juggernaut fan I have to go here), first of all the Juggernaut would crush Wolverine in literally 2 seconds (to answer the question posed in the extra feature) by simply overpowering him and snapping his neck. This is the only way to kill Woverine given in the comics. (Spiderman almost did it after kicking Wolverine's butt but wimped out). Wolverine's claws cannot penetrate the Juggernaut AT ALL. Storm's lightening bolts cannot harm him either so I'm glad they left that stupid scene where he get knocked out by storm & wolverine out. Oh, and he KO'd Colossus in 2 seconds flat in \\"What if Charles Xavier became the Juggernaut\\" - a great comic. He even goes toe to toe with the Hulk. In one X-men cartoon, Rogue tries to absorb his power (and does, which causes her to flip out) without success because his power is limitless. She absorbs some power but it doesn't weaken him. He doesn't need food, water, or air. Magneto, who in the comics can use the iron in your blood to kill you, was literally slapped after he tried (unsuccessfully of course) to do that to the Juggernaut. In many a comic, it takes the whole X-men team to take him on, and the plan is always to remove his helmet since they cannot defeat him otherwise (removing the helmet, which shields him from all mental attackes, makes him vulnerable mentally to Charles Xavier's mental powers). Secondly, the Juggernaut is NOT a mutant. He obtained his power via the Crimson jem of Cyttorak and his power is mystical. As such, he would not have been affected by that little dweeb's (leach's) powers. So I didn't like the ending. <br /> <br />Chalk it up to poetic license and noone but us hard core Juggernaut fans will care. Vinny Jones also did a GREAT GREAT job as the Juggernaut. <br /> <br />The next movie (after the Wolverine spin off and the Magneto spin off) they should have the Sentinels, where the Juggernaut has to team up with the X-men. Just a thought.
B000002I53|5.0|Sometimes Coltraine can get too carried away with his virtuosity at the expense of asthetics, his notes muddling together into cacophany and chaos.  \\"My Favorite Things\\" represents the best of Coltraine showcasing his innovation, his masterful control of tone, and a lyrical ear that transforms this Broadway song into a monument of jazz.

Shay always talks about and it seems like there is something special, and different about this boy. Something that would draw Shay and many others into the mystery that is the smoke. <br />  <br />This book had many twists and turns and mostly left you anticipating the next chapter. The book first line of the book had me wondering, \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" Right away I knew that the author had a creative mind and that he would right an amazing book. I was right! <br />Uglies is a fast paced, easy to read science-fiction novel filled will adventure. The ending leaves you hanging and wanting to run to the book store to buy the next novel in the series. This book is extremely good and definitely not a waste of your time. You will be amazed at the story and amused by Scott Westerfield's way of words. Uglies most definitely is a book that you will want to check out and read over and over again.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|I have been waiting for a remastered version of this album since the first marketing of the CD.  The early CDs, although more precise in information and detail, were very sterile sounding.  I practically wore out the vinyl LP I have in the meantime.  Now the wait is over, and I couldn't be happier.  This was one of the first LPs I bought that was an absolute winner from start to finish, and even left you wanting more.  That has been realized with the addition of six bonus tracks, instrumental and alternate vocal versions of \\"Telephone Line\\", instrumental rough mixes of \\"Tightrope\\", \\"So Fine\\" and \\"Above the Clouds\\", and the previously unreleased \\"Surrender\\".  The remastering job is warm and detailed, quite like the original vinyl sounded.  The line-up of the original songs simply cannot be improved upon, like the review title says, one of the most magical albums of the 70s.  If you're a fan, or simply trying to catch up on the 70s best musical moments, this is one of the best choices you could make.
B000KX0HVY|4.0|This CD has essential songs in it, but of course there were several that were left off. \\"Hitstory\\" is still the recommended compilation. Actually \\"24 Karat HIts,\\" but that CD is very rare and out of print. The first disc has only 20 songs and clocks in at less than an hour! It is also loud, so it does not seem natural, but this is DSD remastered by Vic Anesini and special thanks to Kevan Budd. I think they used their own remasters from their previous discs, combined them for this release, and tweaked the volume so they match. It's still a recommended purchase for completists.
1586217194|5.0|Looks like a lot of people have written reviews, so there is no need to comment on the content in detail.  I especially enjoyed the unabridged audio book.  I istened while commuting mornings and evenings, even though I commute pre-dawn and after sunset in the winter --something harder to do with a book.  Some comment that the \\"science\\" may be flawed; I don't really care if it is or isn't.  For me, the basis of enjoyment is to consider a lot of what goes on in my business and social life, a new way to think about what is really going on.   The problem of using the audio version is that you can't stop and listen to just a sentence or two again and again (at least not on my MP3 player).  The advantage of the audio version is that I stopped thinking like the student compelled to put those bright yellow marks over everything deemed important, and I could listen for the broader concepts.  After all, I am not going to be tested on who did what experiments, or if the psychology is sound.  I'm listening to this book to expand my own range of thinking.    I enjoyed it thoughly, and now want a tangible copy to keep in my office bookshelf for easy reference.  At first I thought that the voice would be monotonous and would lull me into a bored stupor.  But, the narrator does a fine job of voice inflection, emphasis, and pace change.  You can tell when he is moving from anecdote to concept presentation to summarization pretty easily.  And, if I fell asleep on the bus while listening to this, it was because I was going on only 5 hours sleep, and even the most noisy music would not have kept me awake.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on TV.  It may be a long movie, and at times, a hard one to take, but it is an inspiration.  It makes you remember what is truely important in life, and makes you want to be a better person.  Odd for a movie to do that to a person, but it did that for me.  A wonderful tribute to a beautiful and holy man.
0307341542|1.0|This book was not 'catchy' at all.  We discussed it at our bookclub, and someone mentioned \\"she was trying to write like a man.\\"  I agree.  Too much trying to make sex 'casual' talk, and just not enough 'suspense' at all.   <br /> <br />I would not suggest this, and no one in our club liked it either.  There were 8 at our meeting last night.   <br /> <br />Rho
B000HA4W4S|5.0|A great follow up to their debut album. The first single released was the very popular \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\".  Excellent song, video was fantastic.  At first, I didn't like most of songs on the album, but at 3rd and 4th listening I fell in love, just like I did with the first album.  This band is truly fantastic, and the album is definately worth buying.  I hope you enjoy it as much as do.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|This movie has been lambasted by fans and critics alike, but I think it was never truly given a fair shake. It offers a great look at the Romulan civilization, something seldom done in any of the Trek TV series, and it features great acting and character moments for all the major characters, particularly Data's sacrifice. You could definitely see Brent Spiners influence over the story in the Data's final few scenes. If you're a Trek fan, and you either haven't seen this movie yet, or didn't really give it a chance, I encourage you to take a second look. Heck, this DVD is worth it simply for the deleted scenes, one of which features Will Wheaton as Wesley Crusher, and another which features a comical scene involving a new Captain's Chair.
B000H5U832|4.0|\\"Cars\\" was an entertaining animated feature.  The story line about a racecar that is stranded in Radiator Springs was well written.  The moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to.  Owen Wilson's voice is so good as Lightning McQueen that you actually feel like it's a living character.  As big a fan as I am of Bonnie Hunt, I actually didn't realize it was her voice as Sally the Porche until afterwards.  Paul Newman does an excellent job as the former Piston Cup winner Doc Hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races.  I enjoyed this movie far more than I'd anticipated I would.  It's a heart-warming tale.  Enjoy!
B00005JKHP|3.0|I am not too sure what they were thinking when they decided on the script for this movie, its just strange.  Its an alright movie.  I bought it simply because I wanted to complete my Star Trek collection, and it was the last movie I needed to purchase to do that.
B000002N2N|5.0|Loved this album since day one. If you like the Ramones or never heard of them this is a must have. Will make you want to go out and have a blast. You will be a pinhead no more!

B000FIMG68|5.0|The LOST TV series season 2 dvd is great. Better than season one and more exciting and mysterious. Can't wait for season 3 to come back!
B000KX0HVY|5.0|This is a great collection of songs from probably the most famous and influential rock star of all time.  It includes many hits, several groundbreaking recordings from his Sun days, and a few lesser known songs.  While this is a great set of music, I can't help but ask why was this released?  These songs have been released numerous times through the years and most avid Elvis fans already have them.  Casual fans would probably appreciate the \\"Elvis 30 Number 1 Hits\\" CD better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is another great collection of Elvis songs, but nothing that you can't already get on other collections.  If you want an \\"essential\\" 2 CD Elvis set you can get both \\"Elvis 30 Number 1 Hits\\" and \\"2nd to None\\" for almost the same price that you can get this collection, and you would get 61 songs instead of just 40.  Or if you wanted to spend a few more bucks, you could get the 3 CD \\"Hit Story\\" release.<br /><br />Instead of coming out with \\"new\\" compilations every few months, I think BMG/RCA would do better by pushing some of the excellent releases they already have on the market and re-releasing some of his albums that are out of print domestically with some rare bonus tracks.  Or why not release the next \\"Gold Records Volume 6\\" to catch the songs that were left off the first 5 volumes of that series?  If they want to keep releasing compilations, they should at least include a remix of a song to try to attract the interest of potentially new and younger fans.  Just re-releasing \\"new\\" collections of the same songs that have been released numerous times is not cutting it.  They need to come up with a better marketing strategy for Elvis' outstanding library of music!  It appears some of the poor management practices that hurt his career and legacy have continued after his passing!
0743201140|2.0|I know I should not complain about the fact that it was not the seller's obligation to let the buyer know that it is useless to use internet support to find out \\"strength\\" if the book is used one. Still, it is a big disappointment to find out the fact which used book means nothing to get support from the author.
B000002618|4.0|This music takes me back  to a time when Julio Iglesias was at the top of his game. His voice is unmistakable and timeless. A fun and yet very sensual sound
B000002UDB|5.0|I first bought this when it was released as an E.P. just before the ill-fated television broadcast in Britain.  I remember that it was 'especially priced' at one pound sterling by Parlophone at the insistance of Brian Epstein so that it was affordable to those that were wanting to purchase it.  The additional tunes are an asset and round out the album.  Sadly, the price has balloned over the years.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae gives us a revamped, softer Jill Scott. <br />I loved this CD, as does my buddies (all over 50.) <br />We love her fresh take on the best of emotions. <br />enjoy it all you young'ens that she sent this to.
0895260131|5.0|Every American and especially our leaders should read this book to better understand the reason and roots of the current worldwide war against Islamic Jihadists!  It is an easy to read, well documented, concise history of Islam and how Jihad has always been a central part of that religion.  You don't have to have a college degree or a religious background to understand this book.  It is written for the layman or average person who doesn't have a lot of time to study or read.  It does provide many excellent references for those who wish to read further on the subject.  Time to wake-up and understand what we are really up against.  An outstanding introduction to Islam and Jihad!  Highly recommended!
B000GY729M|4.0|Although \\"Sam's Town\\" wasn't very well-received by critics as well as a good number of The Killers' prior fans, I would say that this album is more or less equal in quality to \\"Hot Fuss\\" even though the styles of the music on these two releases are quite drastically different. I myself was at one point one of the fans discontent with this album; it took me five whole listens to the CD before I fully appreciated it for what it was (I certainly agree with the reviewers who have said that this album grows on you). \\"Sam's Town\\" probably takes some getting used to because of its vast deviation from The Killers' former style; the only track that still clung to their new-waveish synthesizer format (as heard in past hits \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\") was the hit \\"When You Were Young\\", which surprisingly seems to have faded off of the radio stations already even though it's in my opinion one of their best songs if not their best yet. I also quite enjoyed the songs \\"Uncle Jonny\\", \\"Bling (Confession of a King)\\", and the title track: \\"Sam's Town\\". There are a few factors that degrade the album, however; I consider the softer track \\"My List\\" a fairly weak effort along with \\"Enterlude\\" and \\"Exitlude\\", which venture on the corny side while also sounding like painfully obvious filler. Still, I hardly think this album deserves all the bashing it has been getting, and I would recommend that those who didn't like \\"Sam's Town\\" on the first listen try it again multiple times; I would have given it three stars if I had reviewed it after one listen but now after five listens I would give it four and a half stars (I buy CD's that I rate 3 ½ or higher typically). In conclusion, I'd say The Killers made a good move by daring to be a little less mainstream and trying a style that maintains a different and more alternative style of 80's influences. It may not have directly benefited their overall success as a band, but at least they can know that there are indeed people out there who appreciate this sophomore album for being different. I would give \\"Sam's Town\\" four and a half stars, and would certainly recommend that it be purchased since the music's good and the band needs some support for the risky move they took with making it.
B00005S6K8|5.0|No its not the orginial which is priceless, but its so endearing.  <br />I loved Harrison Ford in this movie, I believed his character.  <br />Julia Ormond is such a beautiful actress and Greg Kinnear true to form.  <br />I loved it! I watch it over and over
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is the first work I've heard of John Mayer's and was very, very impressed.  It's seldom that I get a CD and like every cut on it - but that is the case with this one.  I initially bought it for Waiting on the World to Change, after I heard it on one of the TV shows as part of a nightclub act.  I finally let the rest of the songs play and was I surprised. Great experience.  <br /> <br />
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I love man, sexy man, singing main stream stuff. <br />I like this one, but he's not on top of the shuffle. <br />Keep on trying Michael, you just might need a better  <br />producer. This one sounds good, but I maybe he needs his <br />heart broken by a Ava Gardner... <br /> <br />
0786838655|5.0|This book beat Harry Potter and all the books like that.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  I hope they have another book that comes out after this one.  My favorite part of the book was when he went to find out who was accused of finding the God's belongings.  I recommend this book to all ages.
0446677450|5.0|Don't Wait.  Buy it! Buy it Now! <br />I've been chasing financial security for years.  Along the way I have PAID for many lessons.  This book is a MUST HAVE for those of us who don't want to depend on our coworkers and bosses liking us or being in a good mood to keep a check coming in.  This book offers a classic, but Proven way of changing our mindset, so that WE CAN GENERATE INCOME FOR OURSELVES!! <br />I enjoyed this book so much I bought the Cashflow Quadrant. <br />Thanks again
0783114893|5.0|Wow what a great film! I saw this film when I was probably nine years old, and boy did it have a impression on me them.  Just getting this dvd a few days ago, which I have not seen this film in probably ten years, I played it for some firends who had never heard of it and with me watching it with them and i watched everyone get \\"creeped out\\". It was fun. This is a great film, perfectly acted and directed, while this version of the dvd is hit and miss I do hope a special edition comes out soon because of the remake. Anyway if you want a great thriller/ horror movie This is it!
B000002OX7|2.0|certainly i dont agree with the 4  5 star reviewers below me.the who were a really overrated rock band and only could make 2 good songs like Wont get fooled again (one of the very best songs ever) and Baba riley. i didnt really like this album and they didnt make very decent music at all. Roger can't sing at all and pete townsend was a pretty bad guitar player and keith moon isnt all that great. behind pink eyes which is amongst the lousiest songs ever written is the most horrible trash tune and could match similar songs like bohemian wrhapsody,free bird,and satisfaction. i rather listen to mark knopfler insted.he is much,much,much,much,much better.get any of his albums insted..he rocked not townshend.<br /><br />ps. take the word for it kids.<br /><br />bluh!!

B000GIWS7E|5.0|In typical DT fashion the guys deliver an outstanding barrage of blistering musicianship spanning music from the pre-DT era all the way through Octavarium in the Radio City Music Hall.  The second set opens with a full orchestra and really demonstrates DT's versatility and professionalism.  The second disc is a documentary hosted by Mike Portnoy which is a must-see for Dream Theater fans.   <br /> <br />I have all of Dream Theater's live concerts and I place this one a very close second only to \\"Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York\\".   <br />
B00005JKG5|1.0|I bought this movie because it reminds me the 80's. But I just could'nt got \\"the feeling\\" It can't be seen.  This movie advices only to be use on Region One in wich I am part of, my dvd player shows only the initial presentation and nothing more, not even the main menu. I wrote to the seller but never got an answer.
B000654Z2I|5.0|I have the album on vinyl and it still scares me half to death when I play it.  Hence 5-star rating for audio horror.  One reviewer suggests that Tago Mago would make a good horror film soundtrack, and yes it would.  Hypnotic, deranged, undead-slowed-up-monster-funk.  Reminds me slightly of Red Hot Chilli Peppers cum White Noise, in an odd way, but with all the joy removed.  The Doc. recommends that you only listen to Tago Mago in strong daylight, in high Summer, above 80 degrees F.... not in mid-Winter, when the days are short, it's raining, cold and generally miserable.
B000HCO840|5.0|This movie was the best out of the series and i am proud to own this Stan Lee collectors edition.It is worth the money
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer is an all-out war.  Moments of relative calm give way to explosive torrents of ridiculous musicianship.  For me, this album represents a high-water mark of a high water period, consisting of 5 Yes studio LPs from [[ASIN:B00007KWHN The Yes Album]] to Relayer.  In my opinion, it's also the last great Yes album.<br /><br />All of the elements that make Yes so good are here on Relayer.  There are really long, classical-styled compositions with definable structures and complex changes.  The rhythms are constantly changing, throwing the listener off balance, and the musicianship is absolutely stunning.  \\"Gates of Delirium\\" is an instant Yes epic classic--from the dreamy opening to the explosion of dissonance and wicked electric guitar runs provided by Steve Howe that lead up to the grinding groove at 12:50.  The band really outdid themselves this time, with a song that goes so many different places but is still, very obviously, meticulously thought-out and perfectly executed.<br /><br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" is another of the band's most daring compositions, verging on free jazz with an insanely fast doubled guitar/bass line combined with dissonant keys and wild percussion.  The song also boasts a wicked moog solo and one of Jon Anderson's most daring vocals, a fiendish wordless chant that caught me completely by surprise on first listen.  The song also includes one new element that really makes this album classic for me: Steve Howe's use of pedal steel.  The song's final section really rips it up with a cutting steel guitar riff that grinds along with a typically funky beat from Squire and White that's ingeniously the song's opening riff, only slowed down.  The album closes with \\"To Be Over,\\" a cooling denouement for a truly boundary-pushing album.  Steve Howe provides some more, atmospheric steel guitar as well as some acoustic (and sitar) playing that lends the track a certain multinational folk feel.<br /><br />Throughout, Alan White impresses with his complex, indefatigable drumming, Chris Squire lays down that heavy, lively bass that he always uses to keep up with Steve Howe's guitar wizardry, and Jon Anderson continues to sing beautifully, giving the music a wonderful vocal texture despite his oblique, aesthetically pleasing but sometimes shallow lyrics.  Moraz gets kudos for filling in for Rick Wakeman, providing less classically-inspired keys that still add to the group's sound and texture without changing it too much.<br /><br />All in all, Relayer represents what everyone came to expect out of a good Yes record.  It's more of a relative to [[ASIN:B00007LTI9 Close to the Edge]] than anything, since it combines longer structures with some medium-sized songs, but is more focused than [[ASIN:B00007LTIA Tales from Topographic Oceans]].  As much as critics lambasted albums made up of epic, complex tracks, the music still proves today that is is and always was compelling and accessible to fans despite its complexity and technical flair.  Just because Yes chose to write long, challenging songs instead of lowest-common-denominator 2-minute pop songs doesn't really justify the sobbery with which their music was treated by hipster punk and indie cliques.  I'm content to live in a world where I can enjoy both types of music (progressive, and simpler folk/pop/punk) without having to be too cool for any genre.hris Squire lays down that heavy, lively bass that he always uses to keep up with Steve Howe's guitar wizardry, and Jon Anderson continues to sing beautifully, giving the music a wonderful vocal texture despite his oblique, aesthetically pleasing but sometimes shallow lyrics.

B000IJ79WU|1.0|The Richard Donner cut of Superman II is a pale, pale comparison to the Richard Lester original version. The only redeeming quality it has is that it did cut out some of the slapstick comic scenes Lester seemed to love (the ice cream blowing in the Zod-Non-Ursa generated wind, ditto for the wig and toupee flying off, etc.) But the new scenes are really lame -- Lois draws a suit on a picture of Superman and realizes it's really Clark! Lois jumps out of the Daily Planet to prove Clark is Superman (vastly inferior to the plunge into Niagara Falls). Lois shoots a gun at Clark to prove he's Superman (where did she get a gun in Niagara Falls? One conveniently loaded with blanks?) Ugh. And there are some terrific scenes that were cut: <br />1) The Paris rescue that starts the film <br />2) The honeymoon suite interaction between Lois and Clark where she finds out he really is Superman <br />3) All of the fight sequence in the Fortress of Solitude (c'mon, are we really supposed to believe the bad guys show up and Superman immediately caves?) <br />It's interesting to watch to get Donner's vision for the film, but his vision sucks. I'll take the original Superman II, which I'd rate a 5, anyday over this sad -- and wholly unnecessary -- \\"director's\\" cut.
B000DWMN2S|2.0|I read a lot of reviews about this film here, and I see I am in the minority here, but this film bored me to tears....It had a couple humerous moments but wasn't funny.  It had a couple touching moments but wasn't touching.  I thought it just sat there and nothing really happened.  Couple that with the total unlikelihood of Jonathon hiring the one tour guide in the Ukraine that had an affair with the one person in the Ukraine who knew what had happened...No...I don't buy it, and I don't buy into the total \\"we hate all tourists and Jews attitude\\"... It was 105 minutes of borrrrring.  Even the dog was unbelievable.  No one in this film would be found in reality.  I like eccentric chracters, but when every character is eccentric, the movie is just pointless.  I think the final nail in this film's coffin for me was when the old lady asked: \\"Is the war over?\\"  Did anybody really take that line seriously?

0465092756|5.0|I love Peter Woit's simple, direct style. It makes this a very easy book to read. Most such books seem to have mountains of fluff between the pearls. \\"Not Even Wrong\\" is a simple, elegant string of pearls, without all the distracting fluff.
B000001G6W|5.0|I decided to write this review only because I read the others, and a few of them left me scratching my head, but to each his own... <br />   <br />The symphony is my favorite form of classical composition, and I have studied the whole life of the symphonic form.  That being said, I think that LvB's 9th Symphony is, overall, the greatest symphony ever written.  LvB's 3rd Symphony abruptly changed the course of symphonic composition (not to mention classical music as a whole), but after his 9th, there could be no turning back.  There are many, many composers who were practically haunted by the mark LvB left, namely Brahms. <br /> <br />But anyway, back to the recording itself:  I have listend and compared many recordings of the 9th over the years, and in my humble opinion, this one is easily the best.  I mainly pay attention to the small, intricate orchestral details, pacing, overall sound, and how the singers blend with the orchestra.  Many recordings do well in two or three of my catagories, but this is the only one that excells on all fronts.  I have spent years trying to find a recording better than this one, and my search continues... <br />     <br />As a side note, the best recording on period instruments is by Harnoncourt leading the Chamber Orchestra of Europe & the Arnold Schoenberg Choir.  A close second is Hogwood leading the Academy of Ancient Music and the London Symphony Chorus, but it's only available as a box set.
0743289412|4.0|Slow to start, and with some repetitious made up words, this book soon takes on a deeper meaning.  To call it a love story may be a little trite - to me it seemed a human story, a story about Scott's scarred childhood, a sister's emotional problems, and Lisey (the protagonist) trying to make sense out of it all.  King tied the story lines together thoughtfully, showing that the bad-gunky can lurk within some of us, and will find a way to come out. Isn't that what cutting is all about - release?  Of course, with King, his way to let the bad-gunky out is to take us to a creepy place we could never imagine on our own.  And that's what King does best - taking us to place that would otherwise be unfathomable.   <br /> <br />If my use of the term bad-gunky is irritating to you in this review, the book is probably not for you.  If you can stand some word redundancy, read the book.  Overall, it is quite compelling.

The facts that the current administration is totally ignoring this most urgent and pressing issue and that an expresident (got the majority of popular votes) has devoted a large portion of his life to \\"getting the message to the people,\\" says more than all the critics can ever say!

With so much evil in our world, life itself is even more beautiful! This is a movie about survival...
B000J103PC|5.0|This movie is miles better than the silly Ugly Betty program that is a big hit on tv which has a lot of similarities.  Ana, who dreams of being a journalist takes a job out of desperation with Runway Magazine.  Runway is the leading fashion magazine that is the leader in deciding which designers will have successful lines.  The magazine is run by Miranda (Meryl Streep in a vastly different role than the friendly psychologist in the recent Prime) who controls everything about the magazine and whose pursed lips expression can sink a whole fashion line.  Ana interviews with Miranda to be her assistant and has no clue as to who Miranda is (she even tells her so).  What's more Ana appears to have absolutely no clue for fashion (a la Betty) though she does have good looks.<br /><br />Miranda relegates Ana to running errands with virtually no explanation as to what she wants.  Also, she is plainly told she is the #2 assistant by Emily, who keeps telling Ana not to mess up because she will ruin Emily's chance to go to the big fashion show in Paris (Emily's entire life revolves around being able to go to the show and get all the clothes).  Ana, totally frustrated wants to quit, with great encouragement from her boyfriend.  She is on the verge when she is reluctantly helped out by Miranda's main fashion advisor.  He helps her to make over he look and right away things start to slowly go Ana's way and less Emily's way.<br /><br />The more Ana starts to suceed, the more she moves further away from her boyfriend, friends, and what she believed in and she starts becoming more like the type of person she always despised.<br /><br />The movie is highly entertaining and Streep is amazing in her role (way more ruthless than Glenn Close was in 101 Dalmations).  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I really liked this DVD. As a fairly younger fan, I have not had the opportunity to see the Eagles live in their hayday.  However, this DVD enabled me to see the guys in action, aside from my collection of CD's. Like I said, this was my first time seeing them 'in person', and I thought it was really cool, especially the Joe Walsh hard hat camera. I gave it a 4 star just because it would have been better to have BEEN there, and the DVD can never capture the full essence. It was a really amazing performance, anyone can see that.
B000957O82|5.0|This is a funny romantic movie. Will Smith is great in this role.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|It has been quite a wait.  Loreena's voice is quite a gift to her and all of us. The songs she picks are well suited to her stunning voice, but Loreena could transfix a listener singing Yankee Doodle. Even though the musicians are world class,I tend to skip over the instrumental pieces and get to her singing. If asked I'd vote for moving away from the heavy emphasis on the middle eastern stuff and more toward the Celtic and its associated instruments. If I designed an album for her I'd have her sing on every track, restrict the middle eastern stuff to one or two tracks, get her harp back out. I want to hear her sing. Her voice and Kate Rusby's are the most beautiful voices I've heard. Ever
B000K7UBTI|2.0|Is it so wrong to expect high quality out of these movies?  Am I the only one who expect's these movies to be true to their respected books?  Why do these big shot movie exec's need to mess with the stories?  I say if it ain't broke don't fix it.<br /><br />I understand that in live action films things don't always translate from the page to the screen & things need to be tweaked here & there to look & fit right; I understand that, really I do.  What I don't get is how you go to make some big budget(or call it that anyway)animated feature & then change around the story.  Why!?!?!?  You're animating, you're simply bringing those characters to life with movement.  It ain't the story that needs to be fixed obviously since the character has been alive & well for 50 years now.  How do you screw up something like \\"Iron Man\\" for gods sake?<br /><br />Once again Marvel (Avi Arad) has given Lionsgate permission to take a beloved character & run it through the mud.  They've slapped a PG13 rating on something that at best a toddler might need a couple minutes of parental guidance.  The story is so dull long & drawn out a child probably wouldn't sit through the movie, that's probably where the PG13 came from.  We get the same shotty animation we saw in \\"Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2\\" mixed with poor CGI to try & cover up the shotty animation.  The animation is so bad that when there's character movement the picture blurs, that's how inconsistent this \\"state of the art\\" animation this really is.  I felt like I was watching a 90 minute episode of that god awful \\"Iron Man\\" cartoon from a few years ago.  Why was it necessary to make this film?  We're gonna get what I can only guess will be a much more superior live action film in '08 starring Robert Downey Jr & directed by John Favreau.  Why would you go and ruin a much loved property like this?  I know, it's because Lionsgate is all about money with no respect for the public who watch their films.  That's plane as day after watching this film.  Shame on you Marvel & good ridance Avi Arad.hing this film.  Shame on you Marvel & good ridance Avi Arad.
B00009RAJJ|4.0|I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, with an emphasis on Stevie. Generally, if you read other reviews of Tusk you will find people don't really like it.  \\"It strays too much from their roots\\" they say. While this may be sort of almost true, as a Real FM fan, I can say this album maintains their original integrity while at the same time adding a different flare. The only reason this gets a 4 star instead of a 5, is that some of Fleetwood Mac's other stuff is better, such as the White Album, or even Say You Will.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Charlie and the Choc Factory is a great take off of the orgional.
0618680004|5.0|Every chapter and every page of this book delivers blow after blow to this indoctrinational nonsense called religion in a form of clear reason and evidence. While every page is delightfull in its application of scientific reasoning picking apart specific misconseptions, one thought stood out for me in the way it so eloquently described the \\"bottom line\\" problem: \\"Religion teaches the virtue of ignorance\\". Unfortunately, I suspect that for this exact reason, it won't change the minds of the believers. If someone is indoctrinated to think that a belief can trump ANY evidence then it doesn't really matter how many more eloquent books full of evidence and reason are presented to him. For the rest of us this book is a pure delight.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|First couple of songs started out slow, but then the songs just get better and better. I loved the rest of the music. The songs flow nicely and are true to the Beatles.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00000AD94|4.0|They came from nowhere with an amazing album, very good, intelligent, great performance and feeling in their music. I think the best are the title track and \\"The water\\", I like very much \\"Go the way you go\\" <br />You will listen to it few times and the melody will be in your head for a long time.  Again, two thumbs up for this amazing debut album.
B000GCFO0S|1.0|I agree with the reviewers who say this transfer is no better than a standard DVD.  I purchased this disc because the 1080p trailer available on the PS3 online store looked interesting and was very sharp.  The transfer on this disc is inferior to the downloadable PS3 trailer.  I disagree with the other reviewer who stated that the transfer was sharp and who disparages the negative reviewers for having inferior tv's. <br /> <br />I have a 67\\" DLP 1080p television that is ISF calibrated.  The other blu-rays discs I've watched (Underworld Evolution, Devil Wears Prada; even the single-layer Talledega Nights freebie that came with the PS3 - which has a worse transfer than the retail double-layer unrated version) exhibited much better sharpness and clarity.  The transfer on this disc is closer to a good upscaled standard DVD than a good Blu-ray or HD-DVD (which I also own). <br /> <br />I give this movie a one-star because its the transfer is not worth the premium paid over the standard DVD version of the movie.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Great re-launch to the long admired hero.  Excellent tribute to Donner and Reeve though Singer's eye for the \\"heroic\\" is far better thanks to new technology.  Look forward to Singer's next effort as I suspect it will truly reflect his own vision.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|If you into Disney movies this is a good addition to the collection.
B000002J2D|5.0|This is the first Genesis album with the ensemble as a trio. Some may have thought that the departure of Gabriel and Hackett would doom the band. However, this album proves that they still had a great ability to produce compelling music. To my ears there are only two weak spots on this collection. These two songs are not bad, just a little weaker than the rest. Some may talk about the decline of Genesis into just a pop band but it seems to me that to the very last album with Collins there remained a link back to their prog roots. How would we explain music like the Brazilian on Invisible Touch and Dreaming While you Sleep on We Can't Dance? This album, And Then There Were Three was where they began to expand the scope of their music and be a little more accessbile. From my point of view that is not a bad thing. And to think we will have the opportunity to see this great band play again live in 2007!
6305754969|5.0|El Dorado is truly a classic western featuring John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. James Caan gives an outstanding performance as Mississippi. Scenery,acting and story line were excellant. This is truly a movie you would want to see again and again.

I heard items out of the left and right speakers that I had never heard before, and I've seen this picture at least 100 times on regular DVD.  As far as the sound track - it has never sounded better.  If you enjoy the regular DVD - this one will blow you away.

1400031524|4.0|'Dogs of Riga' is without any doubt the darkest book in the Wallander-series. Henning Mankell is one of the best in describing the atmosphere in the Baltic countries before the fall of the USSR. It was dark, depressing and, like Wallander, you really didn't want to be there at the time.  <br /> <br />This is not the best book in the series, simply because the character of Wallander doesn't belong in a spy novel. As someone else said, Mankell should stay with the detective/police stories in Sweden. I just don't find the spy story realistic enough (maybe because I am used to so much more excitement after reading his other novels).  <br /> <br />Although not his best book I give it four stars. The description of the grim, volatile atmosphere in Riga is one of the best I've ever read.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Cars is a great movie, and my son (and my whole family) continue to love the story and characters. Anyone who has not seen the movie yet, should go buy this great movie with a great story. <br />Unfortunately, there is little on the DVD but the movie itself. This is uncommon, and leaves me feeling that there will be another release with director commentary or some other extra. I somehow feel cheated these days when I get a DVD without a director's commentary.

B000065BPB|5.0|I decided to change my headphones as my other pair started to hurt after a couple of hours of listening. I have my headphones for about 7-8 hours a day when I am working. I bought these headphones a couple of days and they are incredible. I listen to a wide range of music, ranging from hiphop to jazz and this performs really well. It feels really comfortable on your ears and the noise attenuation is fantastic. Overall, its a great buy for any music lover!

0060234814|4.0|This Review is for the HarperCollins hardcover edition of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".  This printing uses the original text from the British edition of the book, rather than include the changes that C.S. Lewis made prior to the publication of the American edition.<br /><br />In 1950, C. S. Lewis's first book of The Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was published.  This book would later be considered the 2nd in the series' internal chronology.  If you are coming to this book after seeing the movie version as I did, you will find that it is aimed at a younger audience.  This book serves well as an introduction to the fantasy genre for young readers.  At a little under 200 pages, it is a fairly quick read.  In 2001, it was nominated for the Retro Hugo for novels published in the year 1950.<br /><br />The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie) who are sent out of London during World War II to the English midlands to keep them safe.  There they stay in a Professor's large house.  While exploring the house, they find a room with just a single Wardrobe in it, which Lucy soon finds sometimes acts as a doorway to Narnia.<br /><br />The other children don't believe her at first, but later when trying to hide from the housekeeper they are all find themselves in the mystical land of Narnia.  They find that Narnia is in a perpetual winter without Christmas, caused by the White Witch who claims to be the Queen of Narnia.  They soon learn that they are prophesized to bring an end to the evil of the White Witch, and they learn of Aslan, a great lion and leader who has returned to the land and who is the true King of Narnia.<br /><br />Much has been written of the use of Christian themes which run through the story.  Some of them are quite obvious, such as the references to the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, and the winters without Christmas.  Others are a bit more subtle such as the betrayal, death, and resurrection stories.  Lewis also drew on other mythology though, such as Norse and Greek in some of the creatures which inhabit Narnia.  In any event, the Christian themes are not too heavy handed, and the book can easily be enjoyed by readers of any faith for what it is, a fantasy.<br /><br />The overall result is a fun light read for young readers.  As the age of the reader goes up, the amount of enjoyment will undoubtedly go down, as this story lacks the detail and texture which can be found in Lewis's contemporary's work \\"The Hobbit\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien.  There are also some rather odd passages in the book, such as references to problems with Edmund which had never been discussed earlier and an inconsistency with regards to repeated travels to Narnia.  These flaws are minor though, and this work is deservedly considered a classic.
0876852630|5.0|I loved this book.  Bukowski is quite an interesting character and his unique view of the motion picture industry was fasinating and extremely entertaining.
B0000TB05A|5.0|This is the way a concert DVD should be put together. It focuses mostly on the band with only occasional shots of the crowd. Clearly U2 were in their element that night and the performance is passionate.  It is heavy on tunes from \\"All you Can't Leave Behind\\" which can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste.  I love Edge's guitar style and the songs seem to carry a deeper message for me as I get older. \\"Kite,\\" \\"One,\\" and \\"Walk On\\" choke me up everytime for some reason.
B000HCO840|4.0|People were warning that Brett Ratner's involvement in the series would send the entire Marvel universe down the drain. Personally, I found about as much to enjoy in the third installment as I did in the Bryan Singer-helmed first two. Sure, there was a palpable focus on two characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), but they're probably the two most interesting characters! Shocker! I certainly hope they don't end the series with three films - I am not a big X-Men fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three - great special effects, interesting plotlines, and memorable characters. Put those things together and you get a great popcorn flick, albeit with enough drama and character development to keep the non-fanboys interested.

B0000640S1|5.0|Yes, the story line is ridiculous if one stops to think about it but, heck, this is HOLLYWOOD. Here we have the very best of Stallone and a fine supporting cast. This is one of those films that will simply suck you right in to the very end -- a \\"page-turner\\" of a film. And if you're into SPECTACULAR cinematography, they pulled off a double-coup on this one! Action! Action! Action! No dragging! I have to restrain myself from watching this DVD more than once a month -- I don't want to get Stallone Burn-out. In summary, what more can I say? A troubled Vietnam Special Forces guy gets plenty even with small-town American idiots for not appreciating his service to his country, (and that of his now-dead peers!). If you liked \\"Walking Tall\\" and/or \\"Deliverance\\", it's the same sort of idea: justified revenge for atrocities on the \\"little guy.\\" I guess my enthusiasm for this film shows what a regular Redneck I am way down under. Anyway, this one is a collectors' item, not a doubt of it!
0805047905|5.0|this is a favorite book for both my granddaughters (3 and 6) so I wanted one to stay at Nana's house ... they pick it every time and love to have it read and even read it to me ..
0802130208|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, (giving a sigh somewhere near the middle), and ultimately finishing it with a smile on my face.<br /><br />This is not \\"literature\\" by any means, and I cannot at all account for the Pulitzer which it won; however, it's one of those works that I call a \\"break book\\" -- in other words, if you've been reading a lot of Dostoevsky and/or Shakespeare and have a need to jump out of heavier  stuff for awhile, this one might just work for you.<br /><br />The story is silly and a bit stupid, yet still entertaining. Buy a used copy if you can get a good deal or check it out at the library as you probably won't want it for your permanent inventory of book treasure.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm keeping my review the same but I'm adding on some updated comments. I notice that a lot of folks don't agree with my review, probably for good reasons, so I'll qualify all the above by saying this:<br /><br />The book is a \\"romp\\" and the author wrote a straightforward story -- there's no symbolism or metaphor to search for in here. It's pure escapism and mind recreation.<br /><br />This book is simply not for everyone but, clearly, there are many readers who love it to death.
B000I5X824|5.0|I've been a major fan of Staind since I happened upon the music video for `Mudshovel' and went \\"HOLY CRAP THESE GUYS ROCK HARD\\".  Since then it's been nothing but love for these guys.  It's about time they release a greatest hits album, but the problem that any band of this magnitude is going to face is...what hits do we include.  The logical choice would be the singles but Staind has left a few of their great ones (Just Go) in favor of some not so great ones (Price to Pay).   <br /> <br />All in all a fan of Stains will be happy, especially with the live tracks since all true fans know Staind is best when stripped down and raw (best live performance I ever saw!).  Although, I will add that I was a little put down that they didn't include the live cover of Pearl Jam's `Black' which is one of my favorite cuts Aaron ever sang, and songs like the aforementioned `Just Go' and `Devil' would have been welcomed over `Zoe Jane'.  I would have also liked to have seen more from `Tormented', maybe even opting for the original cut of `Mudshovel' but `Come Again' is nice to open with.   <br /> <br />I'm glad they chose to run with the live cut of `Outside' since that's the track we all fell in love with, and adding `Epiphany' and `Everything Changes' was also a nice touch, not singles but repeat worthy.  All in all we have a lot to be thankful for...it's not Staind's fault they have too many great songs to fit on one compilation disc.  Next time guys, make this a two disc set...maybe have a whole disc dedicated to acoustic cuts...now that would be nice!
6305511055|4.0|I must confess, I DO NOT like Robert Redford -- when his name is mentioned in my presence, I immediately get heartburn; however, his performance in this film is superior. If you liked \\"All the President's Men\\", then you'll like Redford in this one too. The story line is a great one, very believeable from my view, and is tastefully and coherently carried out -- much more contemporary than James Bond stuff and, serious, not silly in any way. So, in the end, this DVD is certainly worth buying if you enjoy that CIA film genre. If I did not personally despise Redford, I surely would give this one 5 stars.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I got this DVD for my son as a Christmas present.  He thoroughly enjoyed it and I enjoyed it too, really much more than I thought I would.  There was also an extra DVD that showed casting, how the production was made and cinema techniques used. I really enjoyed that as well.  Brandon Routh really pulled off the role very well, as good as Christopher Reeve could have and their resemblances to each other were striking. Even had a cameo role for Richard Branson. You'd better buy this one.  I only wish I had seen it in the theatre.
B000035P5E|5.0|This is a fine film, tastefully produced, a superior story (WW II suspense/spy thriller), and brilliant performances by the entire cast. My favorite genre is the mystery, epics are next, but I re-watch this DVD with frequency. I'm a huge fan of superior cinematography and this film has it all the way, beautiful color saturation. The filmscore is appropriate to the movie and, really, I can offer not a single negative comment about this work. This DVD is certainly one for your collection, especially if you're into war films or spy thrillers.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Lots of stuff here in this package.  Hours and hours of Who footage and interviews.  Can't get enough of Keith Moon antics. I mean \\"Break Glass, In Case of Keith Moon\\".  Pete Townsend is hilarious in his summations of what the band is about and \\"Who\\" they are.  If you are a real Who fan you must get this one.  I mean \\"Who Are You\\" anyway?

0679422714|5.0|Chang and Halliday's remarkable biography of Mao has been criticized as biased, unscholarly, flawed in various ways, and even written in English that is stunted, too peppered with crudities, and too casual to be taken seriously. Good. The work is imperfect, infected with bias and written in a prose that is simple and a bit eccentric. But, who writes a biography that is not biased and what biographer's prose is perfect? McCullough's hagiography of Adams, Manchester's MacArthur, and the recently popular tome Ellis's \\"His Excellency, George Washington,\\" are all biased works that gloss over problematical character flaws, omit or obscure facts, and present their subjects in a glowing light. McCullough goes even farther, diminishing such marvelous characters as Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson and even Benjamin Franklin in order to present Adams as greater, stronger and wiser than they. Excess and bias have been part of biographical work since Plutarch (and probably before him). It's part of the unavoidable baggage of the genre. <br /> <br />That being said, Chang and Halliday's \\"Mao,\\" is one good read. I couldn't put it down, and friends and co-workers who borrowed the book were similarly affected. It had a special resonance with me, since I had been eager to learn something of Mao but found that the books on him were either obvious Maoist propaganda or too lean on post-war details. There were also the many mysteries (to me) that surrounded Mao, none of which were made clear by the invariable exaggerations and lies about him and his leadership that were reported in Mao-centered literature.  <br /> <br />My first bio of Mao was a short study I read in high school, contained in a book called \\"Portraits of Power.\\" It faithfully repeated the official story of the Great March, embellished with the astonishing claim that during the March, Mao managed to collect specimens of flora and fauna then write a book on the biology of Western China. It described how Mao's forces, completelyenveloped by the KuoMinTang, managed to slip through \\"disguised as peasants,\\" escape, and reform. There was even a brief mention of the fierce fight at the Luding Bridge. Even at the age of 15, I found much of this to be incredible. Either Chiang Kai Shek was the most incompetent military commander in modern history or some other forces were at play. As for the bridge, I wanted more details, so I turned to Snow. Snow's story of Communist forces fighting their way across a burning platform, the chains red hot, but the Communists throwing hand grenade after hand grenade, was just too much.  It still is. Anyone who has had any military experience knows well enough that a narrow bridge can be held by a small force. Even Napoleon - in era of single shot weapons - was unsuccessful assaulting a bridge protected by an inferior force of Austrians. I've always thought the official story of the Luding Bridge was utter nonsense. I was delighted to find that at least one set of authors - Chang and Halliday - agreed. <br /> <br />The authors have been accused of representing their opinions as facts. This just isn't so. When they speculate, they freely admit it, then prop up their speculations with facts and, in some cases, eyewitness testimony. Is any of this unimpeachable? No, of course not.  One can't prove that Chiang let Mao escape, but there is every indication that he did. Other explanations aren't very satisfactory, and the Chinese Communists, who might be able to shed light on the events, do not open all their records and files to review.  <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday have also been criticized for presenting a flat, one-sided portrait of Mao, whom others complain was a complex character, not just an evil mannequin. Far from it, Chang and Halliday show Mao as complex and self-contradictory as any character in history. They go to great pains to discuss his voracious reading habits, his love for Chinese opera, and for the stage, and they include many details, such as thebed he had with a built-in bookcase, constructed especially for reading. They admit he had a kind of charm that could lure and persuade people, and was well read in the Chinese classics.  What is all this, however, when the indisputable facts of his ruthlessness, cruelty, general misanthropy, and enormous capacity for gross self indulgence so overwhelm whatever pretensions to culture and civility he claimed?  A rounded vision of Mao does nothing to mitigate his crimes. It is this very reading and sensitivity to music that puts him in relief and makes him even more the monster. Had he been just a lout and a bully, he would have been understandable, but he possessed some learning and culture and this just makes his ruthlessness and taste for murder and terror all the more awful.  <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday have also been criticized for not going further into the depredations and atrocities of the KMT. The book was about Mao, however, not about the KMT. Solzhenitsyn wrote damningly of Stalin, but paid scant attention to Hitler. Was he supposed to invoke other tyrants and despots to compare their crimes to Stalin's? Are Chang and Halliday similarly responsible for cataloging Chiang's murders and corruption? Do those crimes somehow excuse Mao's? Mao was a big enough topic. Chiang's warts have been exposed by others.  <br /> <br />Chang, especially, has been criticized for hating Mao. Anyone who has read her \\"Wild Swans\\" and learned of the horrid experiences her family endured during the Cultural Revolution can understand why. Her hatred for Mao, however, does not exonerate him or his apologists, nor does it call into dispute the factual material she reports. One may disagree with her interpretation of events, but there is nothing of substance that is indisputably incorrect.  Mao was utterly loathsome. Every aspect of his personal life was bizarre and perverse from his personal hygiene to his collection of nurse-concubines, to his \\"longevity program\\" in which he demanded a teenage virgin be brought to his bed every night. He called for murders and executions, engaged the entire country in a mad, destructive effort to produce steel from pots, pans and scraps, ruined agricultural production and caused a famine (this is without dispute, only the numbers dead are disputed - one million or 30 million - low figure or high, it was still horrible), exported food as people starved, built up then ruined the public education system, burnt books, encouraged gangs who harassed and punished teachers, tried to destroy the country's cultural inheritance, tore down historic buildings and monuments, suppressed science, persecuted the veteran Communists who had brought about his victory,  and tried to supplant Western medicine with the \\"great storehouse of Chinese medicine.\\" <br /> <br />But what of the good he did? We're told by his apologists that he united China. Despots are uniters, aren't they? Hitler could be said to have united Western Europe, at least for a time. Stalin united the countries of the Soviet Union, and later those of Eastern Europe. Tito united Yugoslavia, and Saddam united Iraq. Is being a \\"uniter\\" enough to justify the rest? We're also told he thwarted foreign occupation or control of any part of China, but did he?  Colonization was well on the wane by 1949. Japan was in ruins. Britain had given up India. The Dutch had released Indonesia. The United States had provided the Philippines with its independence, and the zeitgeist of the post war world, led by the United States, was to free colonies. No one wanted a piece of China any more.  <br /> <br />We're told that lifespan and literacy increased under Mao. Perhaps so; perhaps not. Communists were not scrupulous in maintaining records. If literacy and lifespan did increase, Mao had little to do with it. Peace has its dividends, including longer life and better education. After 20 years of better schooling, Mao disrupted everything with the Cultural Revolution and set Chinaback, especially Chinese science and industry. It was only with his death and the arrest of the Gang of Four that China came right once more and began to progress rapidly. <br /> <br />Finally, Chang and Halliday have been criticized because the book, which is titled \\"The Unknown Story,\\" doesn't seem to contain that much new information. This is utterly silly. Yes, there is some puffery in the title (they are trying to sell the book, not deliver it as one more unread collection of pages to academic libraries), but certainly their access to Soviet records, their many interviews, and their extensive research did turn up things and cause speculation that would not have occurred otherwise.  This is seen in the theory that Chiang, fearing for his son, who was in the Soviet Union, let Mao escape under Stalin's orders, or in the shocking revelation that Mao, in one of his more despicable manifestations, had himself carried on a litter during the Great March, while he callously let other, lesser comrades suffer and die.  The book contains much more. <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday's book is a great read, and a great start in purging the world of Maoism.  If it contains some flaws, then so be it. Its flaws are minor. They disappear when compared to the offal produced by the Chinese propaganda machine. Chang and Halliday's speculative and controversial assertions at least make more rudimentary sense than other work on the same topic. Buy the book and keep it. I doubt it will be surpassed soon.    <br />
B000IOM0YM|3.0|Yet another ripoff item by Gene and the gang of KISS. The video is of poor VERY POOR quality. With all of today's technology you can't tell me that the video couldn't be cleaned up at all? Alot of it appears that the audio was overdubbed to make the group sound better. This is just a rip off and I was able to get it for $13. STAY AWAY as you will be able to pick this up, if you really want it, on eBay soon for .99 cents plus shipping. Last KISS item I ever purchase.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I wondered after so long if Evanescence could top their debut CD. In my opinion as good as the 1st one was this one blew it away. They managed to keep their trademark sound while maturing their music. By far the best CD I heard in 2006.
B000IY041S|5.0|I purchased the DVD/Book Limited Edition set off of Amazon in the UK and this was well worth the price. The book is very well done and is some 180 pages BUT alot of the pictures in the book are seen in the DVD. So unless you're a fan of the Very Limited Edition stuff save yourself a few bucks and buy the Limited Edition DVD set without the book. Having the 4 disc is great and the documentary is intersting so I would recommend paying the extra cash to get these. The stage once again is excellent but I feel the Live Aus Berlin was a better and a bit harder of a show. The music is more of a Heavy Metal mixed with a Industrial Sound. Excellent music! I have friends that listen to nothing but dance type mucic that have purchased Rammstein music due to the beat they put out! JUST BUY IT!!
0618680004|5.0|A superb book by one of our best scientists and thinkers. I do recommend this especially to those who wish to make up their own mind on questions of faith and religion. Dawkins presents his thoughts with passion and <br />elegance. A world without God, he points out, is not a world without morality, or kindness or purpose, nor a <br />world without spirituality. There will be many who criticize this book by saying that religion should not be <br />subject to any criticism because \\"we should respect the faith of others\\". Read this book with an open mind and <br />consider whether such a statement is really justified, or rather a convenient way to put down reasonable inquiry.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|If you liked the first and second then of course you will like this DVD.<br /><br />However if you didnt like the first then there is probably a big chance that you wont like this DVD.<br /><br />X Men the Last Stand is a great movie but is not as good as the first and second. For the young ones you should probably not let them see if because there is some death. I bought this movie because I love this movie and I hope you do too.

I liked though , If you have not seen the original then see this one and you will like it. It was full of suspense and tragedy. Also to the FERGIE fans she had a small role in this movie. Emmy Rosum, jacinda Barrett, josh Lucas and Kurt Russell were astounding. I bought it and so should you
0345350472|4.0|Phil's story has a very differnt tone, a married cop, machines with slightly different motives, and much more back story on earth and what is motivating folks.  I think in making the movie it was best to cut out the marriage as well as the backstory on why people all crave to have their very own animal such as sheep, horse, goats, cats and yes even electric sheep.  <br />Nevertheless I loved this book for all its differences.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|Though I'm not a big fan of the movies produced and directed by Spike Lee, I am a huge fan of Denzel Washington and many of his films.  I've seen Courage Under Fire, Crimson Tide, and Man on Fire at least a dozen times each.  My friends told me to go see Inside Man when it was out at the theaters, but I opted to wait till it came out on DVD.  I just couldn't imagine Spike Lee doing a good thriller.  Then, I waited a little longer.  I finally bought the movie and watched it a little while ago.  All I can say is that I was really impressed by the whole shebang.  Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier was his usual great self.  Clive Owen (I do wish he'd taken the \\"James Bond\\" role) as the criminal mastermind, Dalton Russell, proved equal in matching Denzel's smooth and rich performance within this taut cat-and-mouth suspense thriller.  Jody Foster as the mysterious Madeline White was beautiful, sexy, and oh so sassy in a role that begs for a movie about this intriguing character.  The plot, as most readers are now aware of, involves the robbery of a Manhattan bank and what happens when the police show up.  At first, it seems like your typical bank robbery with the hostages being negotiated for a plane so that the criminals can escape, etc., etc.  But, there's something else going on here, and the glues are revealed one at a time, keeping the viewer guessing as to what's going to happen next.  The big question, of course, is whether or not Clive Owen and his crew escape; and, if so, how do they get out of the bank without the police catching them?  Next is how do Christopher Plummer and Jodie Foster figure into all of this?  What are their agendas?  Is Denzel Washington's character the \\"inside man\\"?  Is Denzel's character a good cop or a bad cop?  The movie is over two hours in length, but it plays much faster.  In fact, it seems to be over so quickly that you find yourself wishing for more interaction between Denzel and Clive Owen.  It's wonderful watching these two excellent actors play off of each other.  In fact, it's almost mesmerizing to watch.  Also, I don't know what Jodie Foster has done recently to change her appearance, but she seems to be getting more beautiful with age.  Though the Inside Man is more of a character-driven movie than an action film, it certainly fulfilled both roles for me and demonstrated rather clearly that Spike Lee is capable of doing anything he puts his mind to in Hollywood.  I will admit that there was a lose end that came to mind once the movie was over with (how did Clive Owen's character know about safety deposit box 392 and what was inside of it?), but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.  This was an utterly suspenseful movie with a brilliant script from a first-time screenwriter, top-notch direction from Mr. Lee, and perfect performances from some of today's most talented actors.  The extras include twenty-five minutes of deleted scenes, a fifteen-minute look at the Making of Inside Man, and a movie commentary by the director.  Highly recommended for one's film library!two excellent actors play off of each other.  In fact, it's almost mesmerizing to watch.

B000069HK2|5.0|I bought this album when I was 19, I think it was the summer of 2002, definitely sometime shortly after emo started to become a loosely used word. Screamo was still pretty creative and interesting to me at the time.  I agree with others that if I had discovered this album any later, I probably wouldn't appreciate it the way I do now because it IS a bit poppy, and if I only heard something from a compilation I'd probably just lump it in there with the rest of the mainstream, or whatever you want to call it now.  I do remember thinking it was cool that their lead singer would scream so hard he puked during live sets.  Every album I own reminds me of something though, and this one sang to me, especially when I was having troubles with a particular girl.  \\"Bury Myself Alive\\" was the song I played the most, probably for that reason.  You probably know the feeling.

0465092756|4.0|The book does well introduce the \\"deviations\\" associated with an idea of physics that is getting more and more far away from the substantial function and goals of modern physics. String theory is appropriately shown as the most worrying example of the nowadays \\"mathematical delirium\\" that affects theoretical physics, which leads theoretical physicists to believe in myths that have nothing to do with science. There is a very serious risk that such an epidemic \\"deviation\\" could definitively hamper all paths to the progress of science. Thousands and thousands of obsessed experts in mathematical techniques and games are introducing not only a highly formalised metaphysics, but also a sort of new religion that colud spell the end of science. Peter Woit does well describe this rush to a quite special scientific suicide. Some technicalities in the book - though appropriate and necessary to frame criticism - might prevent the reading of the book by a larger share of readers interested in science as well as in philosophy.
0767903862|5.0|I have always been facinated by Australia.  This book fed that fire and taught me more than I expected.  This is an easy to read and entertaining book.  I expect even those who haven't really even thought about the country would find themselves suprised by how much they enjoy this book.<br /><br />It is basically a travel diary - covering a lot of area of a very large continent.  Bryson finds the people and things that make Australia what it is.  He even includes some poinent social commentary about the indegenous people.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much, and highly suggest you take a look.
0618551050|5.0|This book by Smolin makes a very accurate diagnosis of the critical state in which physics stagnates todays because of the contagious propension of most theoretical physicists to cuddle their skills in mathematical acrobatics, with a special reference to the negative influence exerted by string theorists. Smolin urges for a deeply revised approach to science, for the sake of the best tradition of physics. It's a courageous stance, now necessary and useful irrespective of whether or not you share Smolin's ideas and suggestions.
B000BNNLN4|3.0|The actual history of tractors is interwoven with a story of an old man who seems to have been hoodwinked into marrying someone from Ukraine. Is it really love? Is it rescue? Or is it something in between that motivates all of the characters in this book? This book has an unusual title and premise and yet it was an enjoyable read. The characters are fleshed out nicely and the tractor history can be looked at as symbolic of relationships and how they appear to be made for one thing and end up being used for another. Not the best book of the century but certainly worth the purchase.

B00009ATIX|2.0|I will comment on the ending, so those who do not want to know about it, please skip this.  <br />I was quite surprised that so many people seemed to like this film. I am not one of the people who need spectacular actions or speed in Sci-fi films. I loved the Tarkovsky Solaris which was even slower and more difficult to understand than this, but I wasn't bored a bit.(Though I did fall asleep at one or two places when I saw it the first time. But I liked what I remembered and it was like a intriguing and complicated dream with parts missing that you wish to fill in. So I saw it many times. It was magical.) Since I liked Tarkovsky version so much I was prepared for being disappointed by a new interpretation anyway. But the fall was greater than I expected. Especially the ending.  <br />Kelvin seemed to have died and was re-born as a persona of Solaris sea. (His cut healed instantly.) And then his wife(also a Solaris persona and by the way is not really his wife but part of Kelvin's subconscious guilt) returns and says \\"Everything we did is forgiven.\\" What?! \\"Forgiven? \\" ??? (By whom? Himself? Solaris? )Now they are both parts of the great sea-like- life- form \\"Solaris\\"  but in fact they ARE also both parts of Kelvin's own mind. Then isn't all this  \\"playing with itself\\" in a very closed world? To me it seemed a very shallow thing for such a great existence to say to itself.  <br />I felt that this film did not make me think deep enough about the meaning of human existence like Tarkovsky's film. It's obviously not light entertainment either so it's just a shallow halfway job not really worth seeing. (Though I did like some of it's atmosphere and would have said it was an Ok movie if not for the ending.) {For a while this review was put on Tarkovsky's movie page by some mistake-what a blasphemy!}
B000FIMG68|5.0|... by Jim Abrams and his mates. <br />About the story: for the ones who die after mistery and don't need explanations above all, this is there right place where to look. In second season we're going deeper in the secrets of the island and will meet a bunch of new and exciting characters, but... <br />For the ones who like to UNDERSTAND, sooner or later (maybe the sooner is the better), this could become a bit frustrating experience. More and more questions and very few answers about the whole mistery. <br />From my point of view, I really expect to get something clear in the third season. I'm getting annoyed.  <br /> <br />Technical details: I can only say that the 'pack' worth the price. High video quality and, most of all, tons of extra material (no, of course you won't find answers here either) with some really interesting connections. I would have appreciate subtitles on the extra too ('cause, as you can see, English is not my native language), but this is a really personal consideration.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I rented this from the library and watched all four hours at least 4 times in 2 weeks and the last disc like 10 times and the last scene . . . ahhhh!  I lost count after 25.

B00070DK1E|4.0|After the fan confusion over the experimental album Under Wraps from 1984, coupled with Ian Anderson's voice problems, Tull re-emerged from silence with this amazingly heavy album.  I've always dug this album, and this is the infamous one that won them the best heavy metal album Grammy (hehehe...I have to laugh).  But a little known fact about Jethro Tull is that they ARE heavy.  Listen to Barre's lead guitar not only on this album (especially on Steel Monkey and Farm on the Freeway), but on songs like the title track from Minstrel in the Gallery, Pibroch, and, of course, the guitar solo from Aqualung.  It's not completely far fetched why Tull would be mistaken for heavy metal.  It's just Tull's music is so complex and eclectic that it really isn't classifiable.  It's just great music.  As for this album, I've always really dug it.  I really like the epic Budapest, which I saw them do in concert.  Steel Monkey and Farm on the Freeway are fabulous too.  I have the original vinyl for this, and have been longing to do a CD upgrade.  One of Tull's more memorable albums.
0375423966|4.0|Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, written and illustrated by Marjane Satrapi, is a comic book style (\\"illustrated novel\\") autobiography of memories of life as a child in Iran just before and after the overthrow of the Shah (roughly 1978-82), and during the war with Iraq. Her parents are well-educated, seemingly progressive, and, through the eyes of a child, heroic.<br /><br />Life changes. She experiences the mandatory use of the veil, stricter schools, hiding activities from nosy neighbors, and the phrase \\"...on a trip\\" as a code for death in war or by execution. Children play games of torturer and torturee. Satrapi reveals her evolution as a child rebel, albeit a selfish one focusing on the narrow-mindedness of youth... rebellion is wearing a Michael Jackson button and tight jeans in public. However, reality gets closer and closer... a favorite uncle is imprisoned and executed, a friend is killed in an Iraqi bomb attack, food is scare, and teachers are more draconian.<br /><br />This book took about an hour to read. There is good congruence between the script and the drawings, but the style of presentation as an illustrated novel means there is no depth to the story.<br /><br />Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return, is Satrapi's second installment of her graphic novel autobiography. After reading it (can the experience of a graphic novel be adequately described as \\"reading\\"?), I felt that it was an important and vital addition to the first Persepolis installment. In Persepolis 2, Satrapi is sent to Austria for an Ayatollah-free education. She meets people unlike herself, and unlike the other Iranians she knew. She thought she was a free-thinking liberal, but that was in the context of Iranian culture, not European.<br /><br />I think this book needs to be read after Persepolis 1. With this boxed set, the novels should be read together.<br /><br />The detail in 2 is much greater than in 1. I would guess this is related to the richer memories of adolescence and adulthood. Satrapi is very open and blunt about her vulnerabilities and transgressions.<br /><br />I feel that I need to read a Persepolis 3. That is not a bad result for any author!ulthood.

B000HIVQK8|4.0|One of Harrison's best efforts, \\"Living In The Material World\\" was the follow-up to the massive hit album, \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" If you are a Harrison or Beatles fan, the CD should already be in your possession. The remastering job is well done, but not very radically different to the first CD release. What the plusses are, is first, the fine packaging and artwork, next, the DVD included. If you are only looking to buy this for the DVD, I would tell you to forget it, it has a few nice things to offer, but nothing earth-shattering. However, if having the improved package and the slightly improved remastering, I would tell you to go for it, and if you've never owned the CD and want to check it out, go for it. There are wonderful songs, good production sound, and Harrison and the band had a good groove.

B000000WCA|5.0|With their sexy (but not too sexy) on-stage personnas, pleasant harmonies and honey coated melodies, the Spice Girls phenomena still rages on, albeit a bit more slowly. Back when this album came out, the tween members of the house cranked these tunes incessantly, I at the time was not coherent to the music. Being a classic rock music listener, I  dismissed the Spice Girls as just another pop group. Fast forward to 2006, I'm a bit older and while browsing the web for music, stumbled upon the Spice Girls. After listening to various sound bytes, decided to purchase the album. I would highly recommend people to buy this album if they just need to get happy.  I call the Spice Girls albums \\"happy music\\" amongst the looks of shock and disbelief on the faces of my co-workers. You can't help but like their music. Not long after the music starts, the toes start tappin and a smile appears on the face. I won't mention any booty shakin, thas jus wrong. I've done it and trust me, with my limited mad skills, it's just wrong. <br />Wannabe, 2 become 1 and Say You'll Be There aren't even my favorites, I like these songs alot, especially 2 Become 1, but Something Kinda Funny and Last Time Lover take that honor from this album. The only tune that didn't float my boat were Mama, it was the only song that I felt was sentimental but weak. Some songs were over-exposed in their hey day(cough! wannabe) but listening to it now, the music seems a little timeless, the songs go down as coolly now as they did when they first played. Mel C and Emma have the most noticeable voices. of the two, Mel C's voice is the most distinct vocally and she puts out the strongest vocal performance. You can't help but like the Spice Girls and their debut album.
0307277887|4.0|i actually discovered the book via the showtime series \\"dexter\\".  i watched the entire series (which isn't hard at just 12 episodes) in three days and absolutely fell in love with it.  so, having seen that it was adapted from a novel, i set out to read the novel. <br /> <br />it's a short read (i finished it in just under 24 hours, with only about an hour or two of solid reading and the rest culled from bits and pieces) and it completely changed my perspective on the television show.  as wonderful as the television show is, it doesn't nearly do the novel justice.  they have changed so many things and added so many little side plots that it becomes more of a soap opera.  the book, while darkly humorous, is not nearly as cutesy.  dexter is a wonderful unique character who is utterly likeable despite his flaws.  the identity of the killer is not something you easily guess - whereas they hand it to you in the television show.   <br /> <br />if i had to pick between the two, i would pick the book over the television show (despite michael c. hall's brilliant performance). <br /> <br />overall it was a light, fun, palate cleanser and i can't wait to read the next book.
B00005JPDS|5.0|The Pursuit of Happyness is a very good movie, for many reasons. The true story it is based on, that of Chris Gardner, who went from the middle class to homelessness and was able --through talent and hard work-- to rise to riches, is impressive and moving. While it's shocking to realize that an honest, hardworking person can find himself having nowhere to sleep but a public restroom, Gardner's sheer tenacity and the way he overcame obstacles that to most would be unsurmountable is incredible and admirable. Will Smith, as usual, displays his enormous talent here--and obviously his son, who plays his son in the movie, has inherited some of his father's gift. Jaden Smith is believable, charming, and very cute.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I am waiting for some answers still.  So much has happened but there are still so many unanswered questions.  I have the 1st season too.  Sometimes I watch it over again just to see if I missed something.  I love this show but I hope there are more answers soon!
0689859414|4.0|I read the Spiderwick to my children.  They really enjoyed the story.  If anything, it was too short.  I also purchased the spiderwick notebook, which lets you create your own notebook, but my oldest (the 8 year-old) didn't really like it.  This book, however, was quite different. <br /> <br />This book is full of beautiful artwork, and has high quality manufacturing.  It is such a beautiful book, I had a hard time giving it to my children, knowing they would give it much wear, but what good is it sitting on my shelf?  (I'm a little neurotic in that I care for and covet books more so than the average person, much more so; Ok, I admit, I have a problem.)  There are many fold-out pages with very large illustrations.  I was very surprised that my oldest also read many passages in the book, particularly on elves.  It is very stylized and has a lot of writing that has the look of being hand-written with a fountain pen.  At 8 years old, cursive is still hard to read, but she wants it and goes for it. <br /> <br />Overall, at the price this book is an absolute bargain, and if you like the Spiderwick Chronicles, you must add this book to your collection. <br /> <br />Mark
0393327655|5.0|Wow!  This is great book.  Well written, brilliant arguement.  Religious or not, you have to read it and give it serious consideration. Try the God Delusion (Richard Dawkins), too.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|In my opinion, this was an exceptional movie.  It was full of action and adventure, yet it focused on the human factors of the characters more than it did on the setting and plot (as did the FireFly series).  If this is the type of movie you enjoy, I highly recommend it.  It is a movie both men and women can enjoy.  Much has been said of it in more lengthy reviews, so I'll keep my review to this. <br /> <br />Mark
0764574124|4.0|This is not the book for building complex applications within Excel but that's not what I got it for.  I wanted something that would get me started on understanding how to manuver within VBA and do some basic coding and this book fits the bill perfectly.  It's amazing how many books there are on this subject that don't fill the need for a beginner.
B000A3OMCY|5.0|This is such a great plush toy. It's the ever lovable Stitch at his best as \\"Elvis\\". I'm a grown woman with two teenagers. My youngest son - 13 bought it for me for my birthday. I was so happy. I love him and keep him with the other stitch that talks. Kids will love this guy if they know Stitch and even if they don't.
B0000004F9|5.0|To each his/her own.  The sound may have no \\"backbone\\" but the sonic miracles that this group consistently manages is the real experience. Go ahead and juxtapose Soft Machine with anyone else based purely on sound textures (the only real substance to be extracted from music of any genre).  The harmonics is really what speaks to the music beast inside each of us.  Lyricism, structure and \\"backbone\\" are meant to add only a subtle layer of abstraction which isn't absolutely necessary for pure bliss.  Try it one time.  Shut off the mind and open the heart.  All worthy religions preach something similar.  Please notice that I didn't only say \\"Shut off the mind\\". There is no suggestion of \\"dumbing oneself down\\" in order to heighten appreciation but rather to access a different pathway for a new experience.  This is not only the fundamental pillar of wisdom but it proves to be vital for the maturation of the soul.  All praises due to The Most High.
1573223085|3.0|Mr. Pink's observation on the skill necessary today seems to be great and timely. Probably every person working in industry has been feeling the same idea as described in this book. However, nobody has ever written so clearly expressed such an idea. The author insists his idea very strongly while the evidences he raises are not so pursuasive. Reading only the first chapter is enough.

B00001OH7P|2.0|Probably the most overrated performer of all times, Mr. Bowie is a perfect mystery. While there are moments when his genius clearly shines through (Life on Mars, Space Oddity, All the Madmen, Kooks, notably The Man who sold the World and few more)it remains a pretty frustrating thing to like him overall.I saw him live couple years ago and he really pulled the crowd's strings, undeniably an incredible showman. What about Ziggy Srardust then? A classic rock and roll album topped with Bowie's characteristic juicy English eccentricity.That's all fine, but why should everybody go raving mad about it?I'm utterly perplexed.At the time of its release much more talented bands like Led Zeppelin and The Who were in full swing, Queen were just starting to gain prominence, but people still paid much more attention to the thin white duke.Oh well, must have been his make up...
B000H0MKOC|5.0|To be brief, Thank You for Smoking is one of my favorite movies in recent years.  It's witty and smart without being a movie that you need to set out too much time for, given that its runtime is a mere 92 minutes.<br /><br />While it is brief and inviting to pick up and watch, it does have a serious touch of satire in it, providing a critique of modern day society's overall standards and morals.  In one scene in particular Nick Naylor, the main character, talks to his son in a way that makes his job appear even noble, while protecting corporations that claim thousands of lives each year.<br /><br />Overall, without getting too technical: at LEAST rent this if you like satires, but if you enjoy sarcastic wit and humor, the odds are in favor of a purchase.
B00005QIPH|1.0|How could so many people regard those lads as the saviours of rock and roll?Does it need to be saved at all?There is much more interesting music that branched off rock'n'roll anyway.Look beyond the messy hairstyles,the unironed shirts with loose neckties and ripped converse's.The prep school drop-out image is getting so worn out.There is a huge wave of manufactured rock bands for the past few years and The Strokes were among the first successful breakthrough's.After three albums, the sound has barely evolved, and it doesn't even rock,with couple of exceptions.What pisses me off the most is when they are compared with The Libertines, perhaps the only important act that came out of the alleged punk revival thing.The Libertines had Pete Doherty, hence the substance, they carry a message.Not to mention that their rough sound is so catchy and authentic.Work on your taste,don't believe the industry.
B000HCO83G|5.0|This is a movie for all of us Sci-fi people that love these movies. This was actually my favorite one in the series, but then again I did love them all.<br /><br />Whenever I want a DVD, I go to Amazon, where I know I will find that movie, and most likely not only get the best price, best people to help me and I also have the Amazing Amazon Card, which they send you a coupon all the time and they allow you to use as many as you like. Plus they already have the best prices. But this movie series is one of my favorite. I also get all my TV series Discs right here. If they are not in yet, they will email  me as soon as they are ready.<br /><br />I love Amazon.<br /><br />Thanks so much for all these loyal years of service. I will always be right here. Best place for so many items. I even get my nieces and nephews their gifts and things they might want here. One stop shopping.<br /><br />Love it always.<br /><br />Thanks so much. Hope you all get in on here and see what I mean.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Sweet Baby James indeed has still got it. His voice hasn't changed in 30 years, but maybe has gotten a bit better with age! I was never much of a James Taylor fan in the 70's, but I find myself yearning to hear his music now - probably trying to make up for a mis-spent youth! This Christmas album is superb and it's not over done. It has just the right content and is a tasteful collection of holiday music.

B000F8O2OM|5.0|I am a late comer to the SG series dvd, as I just didn't really have time for a new tv series and I also didn't have cable. But now I am hooked, and the series may be ending. :) Hah, next time. Anyways, I bought this and season 1 together. I also am a huge fan of thinpak, given how many dvds I have. I converted all my dvds into thin dvd sleeves, the memorex slim dvd case.
B00004SAAX|5.0|I never thought I would like Bach's organ works as they can be dense and daunting. However, if you can get onto Bach's wavelength, he can transport you to an electric cosmos of beauty and enlightenment. I was given a collection of Bach organ LPs by Helmut Walcha some time ago. My friend said that Germans regard Walcha as the premier interpreter of this music. He certainly knows how to play the organ and this music soars in his hands. This music is more varied than most people imagine. Some is extremely simple and delicate while some crushes your brain! I have always loved Archive recordings and these did not disappoint!
B000GY729M|5.0|This started out a little different than their last album but grew on me quickly to become one of my favorite albums.
B000007MVM|4.0|As an avid fan of Pink Floyd, I make it my business to own every CD whether solo or otherwise. The Madcap Laughs is by far Syd's best outside of Pink Floyd, so get this first rather than Opel or Barrett.<br /><br />Definitely Recommended.
0375505091|4.0|Pictures are indeed worth thousands of words, and Leibovitz's own choice of  <br />her photography for this collection provides an intimate glimpse of a very  <br />complicated and talented person.  It is a wonderful adjunct to the recent  <br />public television documentary of her life.  I treasure my copy and have  <br />revisited it several times.  I think, however, after seeing the documentary, <br />some of her best work has not been included.  Too bad.  Still, a fine book.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Beautifully produced with incredible sound. Storm came through again with a wonderful design, and I'm not quite sure who edited and mixed this, but a brilliant job on their part. <br /> <br />This concert was played in 1994, so this of course means that Roger Waters was replaced by Guy Pratt on bass. Guy is perfect on bass, and his voice works perfectly with the band. I especially like Run Like Hell when David and Guy switch on and off singing. <br /> <br />The laser show is unmatched regarding scale and detail, but I wish they would focus on (for example) David's fingers during the comfortably numb solo rather than the laser show. The crowd is as amazing as you'd imagine it to be, and there's no better feeling than the one you get listening to WYWH with everybody singing along. <br /> <br />HIGHLY Recommended. Any collection is not complete without this diamond.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|FACE THE MUSIC one of my favorite albm in ELO and i recomended to buy that album to all fans. Inside full colour booklet with great photos and also include  a few bounus tracks. I believe FACE THE MUSIC it monumental album and one of the best in ELO
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I'm going to have to agree/back up fellow reviewer Adam N. Villani who hit the point exactly.\\"5 stars for original film, 2 stars for 'Director's Cut'\\" <br /> <br />I haven't watched the Directors Cut once for more than 5 minutes because it's that bad. Its just Floyd music played to random scenes from space. Thank God, however, the DVD also contains the original concert which I would say is their best \\"live\\" performance ever. It's definitely worth the price if only because of the original version, just make sure that's the one you watch first. <br /> <br />HIGHLY Recommended.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|If you fan of TELEPHONE LINE that what you need on this edition alternative versions and new songs SURRENDER and meny more interesting. I recomended this item
B000002B35|5.0|There is only one thing I don't like about this recording. The woman they used for great gig (actually I believe they used two) just doesn't do a very good job at all. Normally one of my favorite songs on dark side, I usually skip it when listening to this. <br /> <br />That being said however, every other track is all that you have come to expect from Pink Floyd, whether live or otherwise. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.
B00003CXCW|4.0|A classic but only good for one viewing. The dark tale of a young writer who becomes the &#34;boy toy&#34; of an aging Hollywood star. Interestingly, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is true to the original and accually more engaging.
B000FIMG68|5.0|What can I write here that hasn't been said dozens if not hundreds of times over?  This is an amazing show, and as a serial it really pays to be able to watch multiple shows at a time instead of waiting through 7 whole days minimum!  I saw Seasons 1&2 on DVD and have been watching 3 as it airs and can tell you I preferred the first two because of this ability.  I may just sit out season 3 and wait for it to come out on DVD.
B000HWXS2S|4.0|Another awesome album from an awesome band!  Wouldn't expect anything less.  Even better than \\"Fate of Norns\\" although \\"Once Sent...\\" is still my favorite.  The guitar work on this album is melodic and heavy, the vocals are as harsh as ever, and the drums hold down the double kicks like you would expect with any AA album.  Buy it today if you don't already have it.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|This is a good movie but not a great one. I am a big saw fan and loved all the films but this one is the best yet. I saw it in theaters and i loved it. After I left the movies I couldn't wait for it to come to dvd, it was the first movie were I checked time to time seeing if it was comming to dvd, but it is on the 23rd so everyone who loved saw and saw 2 go out and get saw 3 because it is a good way to wrap up the trilogy. You will not be dissappointed and as always theres a good ending.
B000HKCRW2|4.0|After debuting with the '80s post-disco alt-rock revivalism of \\"Echoes,\\" \\"Pieces\\" is a bold move forward. Any of the tracks themselves might fit as a minor outlier on \\"Echoes,\\" but they flow together with a maturity that missing from the prior effort.  <br /> <br />And when I say \\"maturity,\\" I don't mean the bad maturity that means \\"stripped of all its punk spirit.\\" I mean the good maturiry like \\"with added songcraft.\\" <br /> <br />While The Rapture's rock-for-dancing style already feels five minutes old, \\"Pieces\\" is one of 2006's best CDs for repeat listens.
B00003CXWV|5.0|It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.  It was for a gift so very important.  I would buy from here again.
6305944563|4.0|The main feature on this disc, 'Oliver Twist' (1922), is a pretty decent adaptation of the well-known Charles Dickens novel, though, as just about all movies based on books are wont to do, it naturally can't cover everything from the book.  The sets bring Victorian England to life pretty well, particularly the settings in the orphanage and in Fagin's house.  Life was no picnic for the poor in Victorian England, with no system of social welfare as yet set up, and many poor people were forced to either go to an almshouse, or, if they were desperate enough, to turn to a life of crime like Fagin and his cohorts.  However, since it is based on a novel, it doesn't always work very well as a silent.  While there are some great silents adapted from works of literature, this one seems really chatty and like it could have been even better as a talkie.  There also isn't enough character development, particularly of Fagin (Lon Chaney), who, though he's great in all of his scenes, just doesn't have a lot to do.  This was a starring vehicle for the adorable Jackie Coogan (in spite of Lon's picture being on the DVD cover), so it seems natural that the producers would have wanted to emphasise his title character in the storyline, even though at times it seems more like a showcase for Jackie instead of a showcase of the Dickens novel.  There could have been more meat on the plot and greater character development if they hadn't done this; as cute and talented as Jackie was, he wasn't the only important character.  The print also is a bit worn, though since it was considered lost until 1972, one can't expect too much in terms of print quality.  However, I wish there had been a more elaborate score beyond an organ.<br /><br />The bonus film, 'The Light of Faith' (1922), is a 33-minute excerpt from 'The Light in the Dark,' a six-reel feature that was considered lost in its entirety until the George Eastman House found it and did a restoration of in 2003.  The film kind of starts in media res, but that becomes more understandable when one knows that this is only about half of a longer film, not the entire film itself or the only surviving part of it.  A young woman has run away from home and her boyfriend back in England, and finds a room to rent in New York.  (She's identified as Elaine in this film, though in the full-length version her name is Bessie.)  Tony Pantelli (Lon Chaney) notices how pretty she is and that she's not the type of woman he's used to in his life as a street rogue.  When she falls down the stairs one day, Tony thinks it's because she's hungry, but the landlady believes it to be a failing heart.  Tony devotedly helps her back to health, showing himself to be a criminal with a heart of gold underneath.  One day there's a story in the paper about her boyfriend, who is now in New York with what may be the Holy Grail, and Tony is so inspired by the story Elaine tells him about this ancient artifact and its healing powers that he resolves to break into her old boyfriend's house to steal it, desperately hoping that if she touches it, she will be fully cured.  This looks like a pretty interesting film, and probably is even better and more developed in the longer version.  As always, Lon plays this social outcast, this person whom one might ordinarily shun or run away from in fear because he's a criminal, with such heart and soul, making him into a sympathetic character whom one quickly comes to feel empathy for.  He's also looking like his normal self in this role, without any of the elaborate makeup or disguises he's famous for.  Though he wasn't what most people would consider one of the world's most beautiful people, he did clean up really nicely and even seems kind of handsome, in a nonconventional way.<br /><br />Overall, these are two solid features, even though I wouldn't consider either one to be top-notch silent classics.  They're still far from being little more than curios.  However, 'Oliver Twist' is very recommendable for seeing Jackie Coogan (who seemed to be terrific in just about everything he did as a child star) and for seeing Chaney's unforgettable Fagin.  Still, neither film would be one I'd recommend to someone just getting into Lon's films or just silents in general.e for seeing Jackie Coogan (who seemed to be terrific in just about everything he did as a child star) and for seeing Chaney's unforgettable Fagin.  Still, neither film would be one I'd recommend to someone just getting into Lon's films or just silents in general.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let It Be... Naked is a fantastic release by Apple. Pay no attention to the so called \\"spotlight\\" reviewer above who gives it 2 stars due to his utter ignorance. That person is either tone deaf or has never actually listened to the original Let It Be album. The 1970 version's audio quality is so poor and muffled that it sounds like it was recorded inside a drain pipe. Let It Be... Naked offers the listener a gloriously remastered version of these songs with bright, crisp audio. All of the background hiss on tracks like Get Back and I've Got a Feeling is thankfully gone. We can now actually hear Paul's great singing much better on these songs. Also, the \\"spotlight\\" reviewer claims Spector only exercised overindulgence with Across the Universe, I Me Mine, and The Long and Winding Road. Uh, sorry dude, but why don't you also check out the crummy orchestral organ music that Spector inserted to trash the 1970 version's title track \\"Let It Be\\". The new version restores a beautiful acoustic jam in the middle of the song. Overall, Let It Be... Naked is an awesome album that is far superior to the original release.
0618680004|5.0|An irrefutable attack on religion and supernaturalism. Dawkins is probably the leading intellectual and evolutionary biologist of our generation. He has a unique, entertaining writing style. He is the only writer that I know who can take you into subjects and down intricate paths where you don't want to go, then make you like it. Probably no one since Leonardo da Vinci has the intellectual range of Dawkins, and this could be his Mona Lisa.
B000LY5QQS|5.0|Pierce Brosnan in his second film as James Bond delivers above and beyond anything I could have imagined after his appearance in GOLDENEYE. In two years he gained the maturity and a physical presence that consummates his overall performance of Bond when combined with his intelligence, wit and charm that he delivers flawlessly with assured confidence.<br /><br />This film brings a realistic and gritty look to the series that LICENCE TO KILL attempted to, but failed. This is one of the best films of the series and ranks next to GOLDFINGER, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and CASINO ROYALE combing an integral plot with rich characters, action and suspense. Director Donald Spottiswoode never diverted the focus of the film away from the main plot, yet he gave a sense of real depth to the characters. He has a good understanding of how to deliver action with emotional impact. He did a brilliant job and has been highly underrated for his efforts. Also, the producers finally discovered a composer that could combine the traditional and highly personalized sound of John Barry with today's trends in scoring for this genre in the talented David Arnold. Arnold much evidently has a good understanding of the series and the character of James Bond.<br /><br />The extras are very good. They are well thought out and prepared. I like the re-design of the menu screens. The digital sound restoration is spectacular. The new digital sound restoration adds a new dimension to the film. The images are also much crisper, cleaner and vibrant. I also like the redesign of the cover graphics.
B000HEWEEE|4.0|I'm not one for \\"chick flicks\\" even though I'm female, but I really enjoyed this movie.  It takes a bit of getting into, but just go with it.  I won't spoil the ending, but there were a few minutes where it keeps you wondering what will happen.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina's new album is like a trip back to the roaring twenties. Bands were big flappers had their hair bobbed and skirts short and one might find themselves at a speakeasie listening to similar music.  Some of the songs are recorded in such a way that it sounds like you're listening to a 45 or an old  radio.  Combine the sound of big band with Christina's preternatural voice and the result is amazing.  Not all the songs on the album are a flashback to the 20s, and are instead a bit more modern sounding. <br />I should also mention that you get 21 tracks instead of the usual 10 or 11 that most albums consist of.

B00026WU82|5.0|Highway 61 Revisited was a dramatic development in Bob Dylan's career.  Coupling the power of Little Richard with that of Woody Guthrie, he further cranked up the electricity--with Al Kooper playing remarkable organ and Mike Bloomfield turning in blazing B.B. King guitar, \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was phenomenal rock & roll.  For the mythic backroads that had inspired his early work, Dylan now substituted the street--from the album's cover, he stares slightly menacingly; in a motorcycle t-shirt, silk jacket and pompadour, he comes off as nobody's folkie, but an updated James Dean.  The 11-minute epic \\"Desolation Row\\" showed him working out his new surrealism, and the entire record wasn't only that of a new Dylan, it was music and words of a force seldom heard in pop music ever before.

0757302661|4.0|I read the book and practiced with the CD for three weeks prior to the birth of my third child.  I wanted to try it all natural.  When I got to the hospital, I was so far into my labor and was told the anesthesiologist probably wouldn't make it there in time for an epidural to work.  So, I waived the epidural, put in the CD, and 20 minutes later had a beautiful and healthy daughter with very minimal pain!  It was actually my best birthing experience out of all three of my children.  My contractions seemd to last shorter, and my husband said at the height of my contraction I didn't seem to be bothered by them.  I learned how to overcome the pain just by listening to a CD!  I have told everyone I know who is having a baby of my experience, and encouraged them to buy the book and CD.

B00005K3NR|4.0|Carrie belongs in the collection of every horror fan.  Sissy Spacek is perfect in this role.  Piper Laurie is great as her psychotic mother.  Director Brian DePalma does Stephen King's story proud.  This is a coming-of-age thriller for everyone, even those who generally don't partake of the genre.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|The new generations barely are aware about the existence of \\" Fareneheit 451\\" , a fundamental sci-fi text written by Ray Bradbury, that carves in relief the chilling reality of a recent future, where the increasing frivolity of the modern times makes most of us simply have no time to read and so we have to conform with the reading of history without words; I mean the human knowledge reduced to cartoons, futile candies for a funny entertainment and pop corn images that vaguely intend to depict the complex and fascinating universe of the culture. Maybe Ray Bradbury had smiled quietly when he saw for the first time a video clip don' t you?<br /><br />When you try to adapt the personal universe of such complex mind in order to intend to seduce the masses through a sugary plot, you are committing a moral crime, due the nestled reality of any human being may not be told with such linearity; even the humblest person in the world has his likes and dislikes, contradictions, phobias and little sins, because the innocence - in its purest state - is exclusive property of the saints.<br /><br />In this sense, if you want to get close to a light approach of a brilliant mind, then go and astonish by yourself, but at the moment you leave the hall you, don' think you have become aware about the life and times of this man; barely you have explored the anecdotic character, and nothing else.<br /><br />Brilliant performances.

B000HCO840|1.0|I am a big fan of the first two X-Men movies so I bought the third one -- was not able to get to the theatre because of illness.  I watched the thing one evening and was absolutely stupefied.  It was not so much at the bad quality of the script (although it was genuinely awful), but at the fact that an abortion like this could be released without any damage control.  I mean, they must have spent millions and millions producing this -- couldn't they have spent a few thousand on a competent script editor who would plug the gaping holes in the story line.  (My favorite was when they left the Angel in New York and flew their jet to California, and the Angel shows up in Cali in the next scene to make a diving catch of his dad).<br /><br />All in all, a movie worth watching so you can see how genuinely bad movies can be.
B00005MP58|5.0|I know the book very well, and I've seen many movies/mini series versions of the story.  I love this one.<br /><br />Colin Firth is a perfect Mr. Darcy, and the time taken to give life to all the characters makes it a three deminsional experience.  It's rich and wonderful.
0316172324|5.0|I found the book very enjoyable, although chapters four and five had a little too much detail for me.<br /><br />This book is a must read as it clearly presents the role that your unconscious mind plays in decision making. A role that is often discounted and replaced by detailed analytical analysis. In the blink of an eye, your unconscious mind is able to give you insights about a specific situation or object. You may not be able to articulate these insights or justify them to others. However, they are often correct. The author describes a psychologist who can predict whether a marriage will last based on a few minutes observing the couple. This analysis is based on what is called \\"thin slicing\\" - focusing on the few factors that are critical, without over analyzing. Indeed, great decision makers are often those who have perfected the art of \\"thin slicing\\".<br /><br />However, the author also points out situations where your unconscious mind can lead you astray. For example when you have been culturally conditioned to believe in a certain way or where you have been conditioned to make certain associations. The author illustrates how people who are not racist, including blacks, can be unconsciously biased (slightly, but enough to make a difference) against blacks.<br /><br />If you are a police officer, thinking of becoming one or know someone who is, you will find Chapter Six: The Delicate Art of Mind Reading very interesting.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a great dvd for Legend fans, as it has both the theatrical and director's cut versions. It was interesting to see the director's cut, since I had always heard that Ridley Scott was not satisfied with the edited version. It explains a lot of the \\"gaps\\" in the theatrical release and allowed for more character development. I enjoyed watching it, but I prefer the Theatrical version's ending and Tangerine Dream's score, especially \\"Loved By The Sun\\" with Yes's Jon Anderson on vocals.  <br /> <br />Definitely worth buying, even if you already own Legend on dvd.
0316168815|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read lately.  Keep the tissue box close by.  I got through this book in just over 5 hours of non-stop reading, because I could not put it down. <br /> <br />The style of writing for this book is very unique.  The story is told from the victim, who is in heaven, to you the reader.  It follows the death of a girl, and her family and how they adjust to her being gone. It also takes a new lood at what heaven might be like, according to the author, everyones heaven is different, depending on what you would like it to be.  Almost any wish can be granted, except living again. <br /> <br />It will grab you in the first paragraph and hold on to you till the last, making you ask when you are done, \\"What happens next??\\"  I am very glad that I found this book and will treasure it for years to come.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|True to the game, the visuals are amazing in this film. The characters are all interesting especially the morbid \\"bad\\" ones. I loved this film. <br /> <br />I hope there will be a sequel to it. The games are so creepy, which I love. It has the same atmosphere as the games. The music is also pretty creepy which makes great fun for the scary scenes. <br /> <br />The special features of the dvd are pretty cool. It has some really interesting Behind the scenes footage showing how the actors had to play out some of the evil roles. The evil characters hardly talk in this film, its mostly bodily movement that makes them freaky. Plus theres a whole bunch of trailers to watch. <br /> <br />My overall impression was a 10/10 for it. Im glad the running time went for 2hours because there is alot of story to be told here, It was interesting and the scenes were all well developed leading towards the climatic ending. Maybe leaving some area open for a sequel. Lets hope there will be more SH films to come. :O) Im very happy with my purchase.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Little Olive, age 6, wants to be a beauty queen. Yeah, but daddy wants to be a motivational speaker and he can't. Big brother wants to be a pilot and he can't. Uncle wants to be an academic success and he can't. Grandpa wants to be something - anything - and he can't. That leaves little Olive, supporting the whole weight of their failure on her small and sloping shoulders, so off they go to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.<br /><br />Off in an ancient VW minibus, with mechanical condition that fully matches their personal condition - things happening that shouldn't, not happening that should, and utter collapse certain even if the moment of that collapse isn't so easy to predict. And so they arrive at the pageant, a bizarre world in itself. It's filled with six year old beauty queens in tiny flat bikinis, elaborate makeup and big hair, trying to be the seductresses that their mothers never were. And Olive, with her six year old babyfat and gawky walk, wondering why she doesn't have the taut tummy that the others do (and shouldn't).<br /><br />Then it all comes down to the final talent competition, the one that Olive has been practicing for months and the crowning moment of the family's out-to-lunchness. How could mommy and daddy NOT have known what kind of routine she was developing with grandpa? No matter, they're all a family.<br /><br />If you enjoy the kind of entertainment that leaves you happy that you're not them, you'll love it. Although the movie had its moments, I found it a bit creepy that anyone might be them.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000HCO83Q|3.0|All-in-all, pretty much a waste of money.  Completely lacking in humanity/mutant-anity, just another excuse for over-the-top special effects (which aren't too bad).  The killin-off of primary characters led to great disappointment and the new characters that were introduced left me cold.  Looks like this will be the last of the series.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Little Mermaid is a great Disney classic, and the other reviewers have done it justice. No need to add further comment.    What I want to mention is the bonus short cartoon included on the second disc, The Little Match Girl. It is beautiful! Why have I never seen this before? It is one of the most delicately, artfully done of all Disney cartoons, long or short, I have ever seen! And all without one spoken word, just beautiful music and acting!    In my opinion, the price of this release would be worth spending just for this one short cartoon.

B000HCO83Q|1.0|So I was walking home the other day and saw this guy selling DVD's on the corner. I picked up Xmen 3 (I was excited because the movie was still in the theatre and I had yet to see it!)- Needless to say, BIG MISTAKE!!!! The whole film looks really washed out and the sound is crappy. The whole film you can hear people chewing popcorn and during one point you can see people walking in front of the camera!! Horrible! I mean, I understand about trying to cut back on budgets- but THIS IS ABSURD! And to top it off, there are no extras, deleted scenes, or any sort of language options! I mean, how was I supposed to know the whole film was in Spanish?!
B000002G23|5.0|I loved the Police when I was a teenager and I picked this box set up a few years ago and listened to it repeatedly.  The early stuff is good, its not great but you can hear the evolution of the band.  All of the oddball stuff, such as Stewart Copeland's songs and Andy Summer's songs have a lot of humor to them and are gems in their own right and are good to listen to after you've listened to Every Breath you Take for the millioneth time.  The only gripe I could have with this box set is the packaging.  I Hate, Hate, Hate the rectangle box sets that don't have actual CD cases that allow for proper CD storage.  My copy of this box set was ruined because of CDs wouldn't stay in place and got scratched up all to Hell.  I can only hope with the recently rumored Police activity for the 30th anniversary of Roxanne that this box set will be repackaged in a much better format.  If the record company would do that I would re-buy this box set in a heart beat because The Police and the songs they did together were that good.

0767817710|1.0|This has to be THE WORST western movie ever. I do believe the actors that appeared in this movie did it just to have the chance to work together, because honestly I can't find a logical reason why someone like Gene Hackman would actually appear in such a ridiculous flick. Follow my advice on this one DO NOT BUY!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|After skipping a proper review of this film after getting the 14 deluxe set(as there was too much to mention), I find that it is time to give the movie it's own seperate review. This new cut is not a failure or bad as a few other reviews try hard to make you believe. Not true in any way. I think some reviews here are too critical over every little thing to the point of pointlessnes. Now, you all probably know the story behind this version and the original one released as a Richard Lester film. Richard Donner was replaced as director, after having shot a lot of Superman II. Lester was brought in and shot a lot of new stuff, took a lot of Donner's stuff out, and even re-shot some of Donner's material. Now, the original version of this sequel, as seen as it was intended by Richard Donner, is out. Many people thought it would not see the light of day. It has, and it deserves to be seen. This original cut is very good, but it's not perfect. That said, it has some flaws. These flaws are minor and do not overtake the fun and enjoyment of this entertaining film being seen for the first time. You all probably know the story, so need to go there. First up, what is wrong with the picture?. The few quibbles I have with the picture are not much to take it down. The first half of this film seems a little unfinished, and some of the scenes and flow seem a bit choppy. A number of scenes in the first half seem to come and go quickly as if they were spliced together in a hurry. It comes and goes so fast, that it seems more like an unfinished \\"presentation\\" to get the film made. However, that changes in the second half, when the film becomes stronger and flows better. The other minor flaw is the scene where Lois learns Clark is Superman. At the beginning of the film, it states that some screen tests were used in order to complete the film. This was that scene. In it, Christopher Reeve's hair is fuller and not too styled. A second later, it is all slicked back in the usual Clark style.The next it's back to being fuller and bushier. It just makes it seem a little clunky. But that's about it folks. There are a few things here that make this version better and more essential than the Lester version. Including Marlon Brando as Jor-El was wonderful, and it's the way it should of been in the beginning. The scenes between Brando and Reeve are deep and meaningful. It makes more sense and hits home. Plus, it's some great work from Christopher Reeve in these scenes. It's a shame that it took 25 years to see it and to get it after the wonderful Mr. Reeve is gone. It also ties in better with the original film, and it works better with the recent \\"Superman Returns\\" as well. A few other new scenes are really good, especially Lois' first attempt to reveal Clark's true identity at the Daily Planet, and the turning back time at the end of the film. I love the original Lester film, and now I love this film. There are things that I love more about the Lester film, and will still probably watch that one more than this one. The Lester version seemed to have a better consistency, and a number of scenes that I loved that are missing here. The Richard Donner cut is great(despite my earlier criticisms), and I don't think of it as being the Superman II that should of been and that will erase the memory of Lester's film. Both films are great. Both have great scenes and strengths and both satisfy. I don't see this cut as being the new, definitive version of the movie, but just another great movie and a great look at another version of the film. It is definitley historic, a must see, a treasure for Superman fans, and a great evening's entertainment. The disc's special features are not a whole lot, but are fun. Seeing the new film come to life, as well as deleted scenes, make the disc even better. It's like 10 minutes shorter than the original cut, but that's okay. The Richard Donner cut is a fun ride, and should be a part of any fans' library. I still love the original film, but the Richard Donner has a number of things in it that make it far more essential for viewing.
0743298020|4.0|too confusing at times.The last 2 pages were almost too much, the author should have left them out, since they took away from the atmosphere. Other than that it was a captivating story, you won't want to stop reading it. <br />
B000JVT092|4.0|With one of the best Film to HD transfers yet, Superman Returns offers a nearly perfect example of what HD DVD has to offer. There is almost no apparent dithering (little black dots from bad transfers and compression) on the image, and the color depth is amazing.  The 5.1 audio is taken advantage of fully, with certain parts of the movie so well mixed that even an audiophile finds themself looking over their shoulder for unusual sounds. <br /> <br />The only major challenge with this movie is understanding WHEN this movie fits into the entire Superman life-line. There is a super brief explanation at the beginning of the film explaining that Superman has been away for five (5) years.  But if you were not a comic book reader, you may very well find yourself confused at the beginning. Not to worry, since you will see that it bears very little impact on the movie's storyline. <br /> <br />The screenwriting and editing are very well done. The movie is action packed, but suffers from a very weak love story.  The writing is designed to allow you to enter the Superman world directly from this movie, without a major need to watch the original Superman movies to learn the lingo and learn a backstory.  The writers even take some liberties with the Superman/Lois relationship that have no real link to the previous movies.  This movie SHOULD be compared to the original Superman Movies, it's only fair, and as such is lackluster.  However, it is scary how much of Christopher Reeves you can actually see in this new actors performance, but in some respects, he is trying so hard, that it comes across as robotic, with very little evidence of the real emotion that Reeves protrayed.  On the other hand, this movie should also be respected for it's own unique high paced action/adventure style. You won't see this Superman pulling a cat down out of a tree.
0060786523|5.0|A contemporary critic reacted to War and Peace with the exclamation, \\"It's not a book, but an elephant!\\" A Suitable Boy is a lengthier book of similar scope (although more tightly-structured, I think). Tolstoy is a genius because He Did It First, but that does not take away from the fact that with A Suitable Boy, Seth has earned his place in the Canon alongside War and Peace, Anna Karenina and other nineteenth-century greats, for every reason one can name.  Let me get it over with. Yes, this is a big book. It is a very long book. It is 1,488 pages long. Yes, let us all say it again: That makes it a Very Long Book. Those readers whose attention spans have been permanently shrunken by 30-second commercials and 50-minute TV programs will have a hard time with this book. There are also lots of important characters, too, just as in Anna Karenina, where you have three families closely depicted. So there are lots of people to keep straight. The good news is that Seth's characterizations are such that you can tell who's speaking, often, merely with the dialogue. You very often don't need the tags, \\"Arun said,\\" or \\"Kakoli said.\\" But yes, there are lots of characters, lots of things happening, and it takes a long time to read because it's yes, Very Long. To those whose major complaint is the length: Don't be afraid -- it won't bite. Open it up and read it, one page at a time.  And let us get this out of the way, too: No, this is not a Sweeping Tumutuous Saga. If you loved Kristin Lavransdatter, you will not like A Suitable Boy. It is not a romance novel, even though it begins and ends with weddings. It has a similar feel to Anna Karenina, but with a little more hilarity and a lot less heartbreaking tragedy (in the literary sense). There are political speeches in it, just like in War and Peace, and Vikram Seth takes the trouble to quote speeches and Parliamentary minutes verbatim. He has done his homework. But no bodices are ripped.  The book is a snapshot of life in India inthe 1950's. The chronicling of the lives of the Mehra, Kapoor, Chatterji, families is a feast because of delectable prose, excellent characterization, delicious Indian food, and the exciting life of newly-Independent India on the heels of the partition of India and Pakistan. The writing within is nothing if not versatile: Seth does write poetry, but even his novel in verse, The Golden Gate, while equally delicious and fragrant, does contain stanzas of the merest doggerel. Similarly, in A Suitable Boy, the couplets that the Chatterjis fling back and forth are frequently funny, but will not be appearing in any anthologies any time soon. Still, anyone who has been to poetry readings will appreciate the poetry reading scene that Lata attends at the beginning of the book, and one doesn't have to be an expert in 1950's Indian poetry to find Seth's parodies very entertaining. The poems of the character Amit Chatterji are striking, but I admit it will take me a fourth reading to truly appreciate them.  The only complaint I have is an observation: Seth needs a glossary. While most readers won't have trouble with food-related terms like \\"gulab jamun\\" or \\"nimbu pani,\\" they may not precisely know what a khatri is (although they may guess it has something to do with caste), or a Pathan. And with regard to one vocabulary word, the knowledge of it has the potential to affect the reader's perception of Lata and Haresh.  From the first, as soon as Lata meets Haresh, she dislikes his \\"co-respondent shoes.\\" She makes other observations about his dress, as well. And about his English. But throughout the rest of the book, Lata goes back to those co-respondent shoes. The reference is repeated so it seems to be important -- at least to Lata. But what are co-respondent shoes? They are a flashy kind of two-toned shoe worn by swingers during the 1930s. They're called \\"co-respondent\\" shoes because, a co-respondent in a British divorce case is the man who has committed adultery with one's wife. What is more, in a time when no-fault divorces were illegal, a man might put his distinctive \\"co-respondent shoes\\" outside of the hotel room door to be cleaned...and he might be identified by his shoes, later.  So Haresh's shoes were flashy bordering on vulgar but they were also twenty years out of fashion, so the shoes were a lot to overcome.  A reader shouldn't have to resort to a search engine in order to learn such a pivotal point. Please,Vikram Seth, the book is a delightful jewel, so please, help out your readers with a glossary!  The book is delightful in every way, and it is one of those books where you close the book with regret that the book is over. But if you reread this memorable book again, you will keep making new discoveries.  The remainder of this review is devoted to the ending. Please do not proceed any further unless you have read the book.  SPOILER ALERT. SPOILER ALERT. SPOILER ALERT.  Some observations about Lata's ultimate choice: The first time I read this book I thought that Lata had made a terrible mistake, and that her choice was inconsistent with her character, and I felt that Seth had forced the choice against the will of the character to make some kind of heavy-handed point. However, upon re-reading the book, I re-read Haresh's letters, and re-thought the time-line of her romance with Kabir, and her decision makes perfect sense. Lata picked a good man for precisely the right reasons. Kabir is a decent guy, and handsome and witty. But Lata and Kabir really don't develop the friendship that is essential for a good marriage. He's handsome, and he and Lata are intellectually compatible, but for all of that, their romance is an infatuation. In contrast, Haresh grows on Lata, and his fundamental decency and flexibility are more important than what is clearly an infatuation.  Mrs. Rupa Mehra's objection to Lata's relationship with Kabir is that Kabir is a Muslim and Lata is a Hindu. On the surface, the basis for this objection might be considered to be flawed - based on bigotry or stereotyping, but Lata has friends who are in purdah, so her mother's worries are not academic. And one must consider the violence that had just afflicted Hindu and Muslim alike in the time surrounding the Partition - wounds are still raw. In fact, Kedarnath Tandon bears the scars of it on his hands. However, it is clear on a close reading that Mrs. Rupa Mehra is not just indulging in mindless prejudice, but approaches marriage as most likely to be successful when it is a union of two people who have a lot in common. She doesn't just want Lata to marry a Hindu, she wants Lata to marry a khatri boy. She is just as horrified to hear that the brahmin Amit Chatterji is courting Lata, and has the impulse to remove Lata to another town, but realizes that it is not realistic to reduce Lata to an intinerant state because she attracts some unsuitable boys. Reasonable people might debate whether marrying someone who is like you is a good thing or a bad thing, but attributing Lata's family's objections to bigotry or religious closed-mindedness or some other bad trait is simplistic and disingenuous.  More to the point, Lata does not acquiesce to her mother's wishes, she follows her own. Haresh Khanna's misunderstanding of the word \\"mean,\\" his reaction to it, his apology, and his wish for future guidance from Lata, immediately precede Lata's decision to marry him. Yes, he wears \\"co-respondent shoes\\" and doesn't seem to be as handsome as Kabir, speaks thickly-accented English and not well, but looks and shoes are not a good basis for choosing a life partner. Since Lata and Haresh speak several languages, his lack of total fluency in English is not as relevant here. And Lata wants to marry him anyway. This shows her growth, as well. Lata is depicted throughout as an independent-minded, intelligent girl, and the basis for her decision is consistent with her character, for all on first reading it might be tempting to root for Lata-and- Kabir.Furthermore, the outcome demonstrates Seth's ability to write plots and not cliches.
B000K7VHUU|2.0|Unfortunately for Universal, they chose the wrong people to transfer this title.  The sudio has had absolutely no remixing, and even though there is a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, all of the audio is mixed onto the center channel.  There isn't even Stereo, the audio is all center channel mono! On top of that, the audio is muffled, the music sounds like it's being sent through a circa 1965 radio. <br /> <br />That having been said, the picture quality is fairly good.  I would classify it as somewhere between DVD upconversion, and a true HD film transfer. <br /> <br />Overall, this may be the first HD DVD that I have seen that should not actually be classified as HD. With such a poor mono audio track, I would suggest skipping this HD DVD.
0743201140|5.0|I loved this book.  The idea is that a person's greatest strengths are something that comes as natural as breathing.  The strengths that were indicated for me were things I didn't see as strengths for that very reason.  I got great ideas for how to more fully utilize these gifts in my work.  It was very self validating and suprising!!
B000GNOM78|5.0|There is not a single HD DVD on the market with as many comentaries and featurettes as this movie.  It will take you several evenings to finish it all. If you are even slightly interested in documentaries or history, you will find much of the additional material interesting, especially the interview with Bruce's Wife. <br /> <br />The HD transfer is very good. Considerable time was spent removing film artifacts and making sure the colors were bright and rich.  This is how HD DVD should be.  Due to the very poor soundtrack from the original movie, the 5.1 mix is mediocre.  However, it is to be expected, and does not take away from the HD film experience. <br /> <br />Overall, if you have found your way to this Movie's page on Amazon, then you are probably interested enough for this HD DVD movie to be a must buy.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I want to start out by saying how much I love this game! It is so fun and so easy to learn, everybody should own it. I became interested in it after helping my son with some homework using pentominos. It is great mental exercise for spatial thinking and geometry.  Like many other games you have to play defensively as well as offensively and to play well, you have to think several steps ahead.   <br /> <br />Other reviewers are right about one thing...playing \\"one on one\\" is really cumbersome. That is, until now....here is the easy way to have a two player game. Only use a 14x14 part of the board!  The entire board is 20x20 or 400 squares. By using a 14x14 section, you get 196 squares almost exactly half the area.  I took a Sharpie and put a little line on the edge of the board so I know where my artificial edges are.  Another way to have an easy two player game is to buy the Travel Blokus from our good friends at Amazon.com.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|The first few minutes into the film you are seriously going to wonder what ever compelled you to give this flick a chance, but after watching it from beggining to end, it becomes apparent what a great film this is. It is impossible for anyone to sit through it and not get anything out of it. <br /> <br />It is a bit violent (VERY violent) but if you were able to sit through Kill Bill without glancing away from the screen, you can definately handle this film. I recommend it to anyone that has the stomach for it.
B000G75AE8|4.0|I found this album to be an absolutely fantastic change in direction. The style is very reminiscent of the agressive feel of their older album, Reign in Blood. Lombardo is still virtuosic as ever on the drums and kerry king and jeff hanneman still make their guitars sound like you are on the ninth plane of hell. <br /> <br />The only aspect about the album that kept me from giving it 5 stars is Tom Araya's vocals. At times they do not seem to be quite in tune with everyone else and it's much more yelling than singing these days. I don't think I've heard any of his higher pitched screams in over 10 years either. It's a shame that such abuse over time can ruin the voice.
B0002RQ2T4|3.0|I had first discovered \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" 4 years ago, browsing in a local book store. The manga, by Masamune Shirow, captivated me. It had everything: good action, a strong (somewhat overused) story, and a fair amount of comic relief. If I were to rate the manga, I would give it a perfect 5-star rating. <br /> <br />That being said, I cannot give the movie such a high rating. It seems to miss some of the magic from the original manga, and although the main plot is essentially the same, there are a number of things that made the movie seem comparatively empty. While in the manga you got to see a fair amount of character development and a large variety of action sequences, in the movie the characters seem rather bland and the action seems limited. Having recently watched the movie, I must confess that I was disappointed with what made it to film. This is not to say that this is a \\"bad\\" movie, in fact I'm sure that many people will enjoy it. The parts that were used from the manga for the film seemed to have been translated from paper to film perfectly, but so many essential parts were left out. <br /> <br />Overall, if I had not previously read the manga, I would have possibly given the movie a much higher rating. The movie itself contains a fair amount of action, and the dated story is good enough to top most anime movies out today, but for those with previous experience with the manga, I must warn you that the film will seem incomplete.

Any other author I would have stopped reading in the first 5-10 pages...the only reason I keep reading is the HOPE that it would get better...it didn't. I will finish this book because it's Stephen King, I will keep it because it's Stephen King but I will not re-read it like the others. <br />The awesome writer finally had made a BOMB.

B000AP04EW|1.0|A real silly movie!  Reminds me of the Spy vs. Spy cartoon in MAD Magazine.  I saw it on Cable and switched channels half-way through.  There's such a thing as TOO MUCH ACTION in a movie, and on top of it, it had very little plot!  I wouldn't have paid a dime to see it at the show or to rent the DVD.
B00005JPCD|5.0|This movie was fantastic, the music was awesome, and the cinematography was nothing short of breath-taking. The characters were wonderful and incredibly entertaining, and the story is really neat too. Just don't take it too seriously (it's a cartoon after all), and you'll love it.
B00003OSU4|5.0|We got this after seeing the Anita O'Day clips on YouTube.  We think she certainly was one of the stars of this event, but the entire documentary is delightful and inspiring, both for the music recorded and the recorded moments of the jazz audience in 1958.  Worth owning!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I'm a big Evanescence fan, so there was a lot of expectations for this new CD.  The themes of the lyrics aren't as plain as in \\"Fallen\\", but I think that's what makes the CD unique.  They've definitely deviated from what they were doing before and the reasons for their music.  But, there is a little dark undertone in most all the songs, with the exception for the last track, \\"Good Enough\\".  A really good buy for any fans (who should already have it!) and for those looking for some great music... and I mean the intrumental type.  I love it!
B000H7JCG4|4.0|Overall, not bad DVD set, excluding two things - changed music (I hate it, the music in the original series was way better) and no subtitles. Everything else is OK. But there could be more special features apart from: <br />1). Begginings with Darren Star <br />2). Meet the class of Beverly High <br />3). Behind the Scenes <br />4). Audio commentary by Darren Star <br />5). The Recap
0618680004|4.0|Mr. Dawkins's book is written with the layman secular humanist or the theist in mind.  Perhaps, it is written moreso with that person who is contemplating their philosophy of life, and is open, willing, and able enough to consider a philosophy that does not include a deity of any kind.  If this is the case, I believe that Mr. Dawkins has high aspirations.  The God Delusion is Mr. Dawkins' explanation and offering about where the idea of a god came from, and what are some possible answers concerning life without mysticism (in the religious sense)respectively.  This book is, even moreso than his previous, an easy read.  That being said, Mr. Dawkins writes with the theist in mind rather than the atheist.  It is not information as to why accounts and theories concerning God does not work as much as it is about why one ought to free one's self from the delusion of God.  Although I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit ridiculing towards religion at times.  This may have been the goal, but if one is writing a book to theists in order for them to consider alternative views, I do not know if that is the most conducive course of action?  The God Delusion is interesting and fun to read regardless of one's religious background.  Pick it up with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

B0001WTWCO|2.0|No, I think I just don't like it.  It's very boring to look at in an expensively shot way.  I liked Kristin Scott Thomas and like Juliette Binoche but watching this movie was similar to watching Titanic and Wedding Banquet - disbelief at the hype and total boredom.

B000063DIR|1.0|This is a Definite Classic Recording that has been Tampered with and ruined over Greed - I'm the biggest Ozzy/Randy/Sabbath Fan - Blizzard and Diary are both Sacred Recordings - I bought both of the 2002 Remasters - I recently purchased a CD deck for my car - I put in this current Diary remaster - I couldn't figure why out why it sounded so bad - I read the credits and found that Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake were replaced and the drums and bass were re recorded - What a Mess Mr & Mrs Osbourne - What a way to ruin a classic and Tarnish Randy's memory - Randy's spirit and energy are in the original recordings with the original members - even the 1995 Diary remaster credits Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge for bass and Drums - What's the deal Ozzy? Was the Bass and drums re recorded on that version as well?? Cassette - LP and original CD versions are the only recordings I trust. With more bands doing remasters and remixing it only makes the originals more desireable - The Osbourne Family should get out their check books and start writing out refunds to the millions of fans they screwed over - Ozzy!!! Pay Lee and Bob for their work and please reissue these albums untouched with the Randy Bonus Tracks that are being held back - It's all about Cash and Greed - I was a big Ozzy fan - I guess we did find out ' You Can Kill Rock and Roll!!!
0743298020|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, knowing that it was being raved about.  I thought I would get to the book sooner or later.  Well I'm glad it was sooner!!  This book kept me guessing.  I wanted to know more and more.  I wanted to find out the ending well before I got to the middle.  I loved it.  It was an easy read, had well defined characters and a very twisted ending.  One I never guessed!  Above all, this was a great book.  I've already loaned my copy out, I recommend it that much.

B00005JP9V|5.0|Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n lends both scarifying grit and unexpected heart to this propulsive, rewarding 2006 screen adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 dystopian sci-fi novel about a hopeless future with no children. There have been many apocalyptic films that deal with Armageddon in many different forms, yet this one reverberates from a most plangent storyline of global collapse as Cuar&oacute;n thoughtfully brings it down to a human-size scale. Set in England only twenty years hence, the film shows a relentlessly bleak landscape not too far imagined from the present. Cuar&oacute;n manages to tether us to the fantastical story by making 2027 London look realistically desultory and shell-shocked with its faded double-deckers and Bangkok-style tuk-tuks. In turn, the Bexhill refugee camp later in the film has a startling resemblance to the Abu Ghraib prison and the surrounding streets a dead ringer for the shots of violent warfare we are used to seeing in Iraq on CNN.<br /><br />The plot centers on Theo Faron, a former political activist who has been numbed into apathy by the increasingly nihilistic state of the planet. Because its isolated island geography has ensured the success of an emerging fascist government, Great Britain has become the only nation to survive the worldwide nuclear terrorism. Foreigners are automatically labeled illegal immigrants and placed in brutalizing internment camps, and at 18, the youngest person on the planet has just been stabbed to death. The news is devastating to the masses because infertility has plagued the planet for nearly two decades with no hope for the human race to survive. Kidnapped by the Fishes, a revolutionary group supporting the foreigners' human rights, Theo finds out the dastardly act was masterminded by his ex-wife Julian, who heads the group. Her motivation becomes clear as they are holding a West African girl named Kee, who happens to be eight months pregnant. The rest of the film focuses on the clandestine effort to transport Kee to the Human Project, an offshore organization dedicated to reversing the global infertility.<br /><br />There are so many strong visual cues and unexpected plot turns that it is impossible to be bored by the story penned by no less than five screenwriters including Cuar&oacute;n. A powerful example is the meticulous portrayal of Theo's cousin Nigel, the one official who can secure travel documents for Kee's passage, as the curator of the world's surviving masterworks (including Michelangelo's damaged David and Picasso's Guernica) in the reconverted Tate Modern. Another is the superb cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, richly textured in establishing the bombed-out, authoritarian universe and documentary-like once the more violent aspects take over the movie. Particularly impressive is the extended scene where the Fishes attempt to escape an aggressive ambush in a speeding car, as well as the concluding battle scenes which culminate into an unexpected religious allegory.<br /><br />After his scene-stealing turns in \\"Closer\\" and \\"Inside Man\\", Clive Owen really owns this movie from start to finish with a richly complex portrait of a man who discovers his sense of purpose against seemingly insurmountable odds. In fact, his committed performance holds together some of the more far-fetched plot developments like Theo's too-easy escape from the safe house. Claire-Hope Ashitey provides a striking presence as the vulnerable but amazingly resilient Kee. Also making vivid impressions are the reliable Julianne Moore as Julian, Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow revolutionary Luke, Danny Huston as Nigel, Pam Ferris as Kee's self-appointed guardian Miriam (who provides an essential back story behind the infertility), Peter Mullan as the corrupt policeman Syd, and an especially colorful Michael Caine as Theo's perpetually quixotic friend Jasper. This is nicely audacious filmmaking, a creative masterstroke that marks Cuar&oacute;n as an important creative force in cinema.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Bottom line.....the first two X-Men movies were much better!
B000EJ9N6Y|4.0|Don't know where i was when this wonderful bit of fluff emerged, but I'm glad I caught up to it.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|This film was the most intense of the three, but had poor charater development. I enjoyed the movie, but wished it had been a bit longer, and fleshed out the charaters more.
B00005JP9V|4.0|This film was surprisingly believable. The story was told as if evolution COULD prevent fertility of humans in the very near future due to our experiments, corruptions and quick-fixes. Some may see the movie as political but that would apply to any war/end-of-the-world movie. It was almost like a movie outlining the consequences of our actions due to those who trying to prolong life, create more life, and alter life from its natural state. It was made out as a reality-like punishment from God for our evils. That's the basic point of many movies made but it's been a long time since I've seen one delivered quite as well. It ended up being more of a war movie than futuristic sci-fi. The quiet scenes were by far the best in the movie. I'd explain what it was but that would give away one of the most important parts of the movie. It's not as if it was a suspensful movie. Very dramatic actually and even spiritual in several scenes. Naturally, sad too. Talk about sacrifices to protect the cause!<br /><br />I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending but it still was better than I anticipated. As my husband said, it almost made it seem as if there was going to be a sequel (I hope not though because it would probably ruin the philosophical aspects, like what the 2nd & 3rd Matrix movies did for the first). We were left to wonder whether or not mom & baby were really going to be protected as they tried so hard to get to a safe place. BUT if it ended up happy & \\"la-dee-da\\" it would have made the ending corny, which then would have ruined it all. So I'm as satisfied as I could be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a wonderful series.  It is a mix of Science Fiction and Western with a little piracy thown in.  The cast did a wonderful job with the characters, and the show was wonderfully entertaining. The series had wonderful potential, but the executives at Fox chose not to complete the first season.  Had the executives at Fox chosen to support Firefly rather than bury it, Firefly would have been a bigger hit than Star Trek.  Even two years after its demise, it still has a huge number of fans.

B00023B1LC|5.0|Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity, discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin.<br /><br />Reason for the Rating: Violence and some language.<br /><br />Based on the Robert Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is ease.<br /><br />As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an Italian fishing boat. The \\"hey, this is a story about espionage\\" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and until now, so does the audience.<br /><br />If there is one misstep in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a \\"how will he survive?\\" thriller rather than a \\"who am I?\\" mystery.<br /><br />A love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress Franka Potente) gives Bourne a \\"partner in crime\\" to play off of for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development. An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the action.<br /><br />The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling into the Mediterranean Sea.<br /><br />Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film is a winner for older teens and adults.<br /><br />Nappaland.com Recommends: Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a worthy discovery.<br /><br />After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:<br /><br />---What do you think prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about Bourne's moral compass?<br /><br />---How would you feel if you suddenly couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to discover your identity?<br /><br />---When faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew.

B000EHSVS2|5.0|I've always been really into WWII history, my Grandfather served as a machine gunner and scout during the war, and as a kid I use to listen to him talk about his times in Europe.  I remember one winter when a snow storm came through and it was probably 15 degrees outside and snowing like heck and he said \\"this is damn cold, this reminds me of Bastogne.\\"  I didn't know where Bastogne was or what it was, but later on after he passed away in 1999 I began to have a greater appreciation for what the men of 'The Greatest Generation' did, and I learned about Bastogne. That's why I love this movie.  The classic opening is what WWII was all about to me and why my Grandpa fought.  Gen. Patton is one of my personal heroes.  I look up to any man who can look the enemy in the eye and not flinch.  This is a great movie.  Although by modern standards (Saving Private Ryan, and Band of Brothers) the action and special effects are somewhat dated, but the story is timeless.  It also has some great extras.  There is a documentary on Gen. Patton as well as an impressive photo gallery set to the soundtrack.  Then there is a special on one of the units that Gen. Patton comanded.  If you like/love this movie like me then you owe it to yourself to get this fine edition of a cinematic classic.
B00005JPCA|4.0|Plot Summary: A super-spy must stop terrorists from funding their activities<br /><br />Reason for the Rating: Intense sequences of violent action, a scene of torture, sexual content and nudity.<br /><br />Bond...James Bond.<br /><br />How we love this spy who uses his suave personality and high-tech gadgets to catch his prey. If you like that Bond, and are hoping to see him again in Casino Royale, then you'll probably be surprised and possibly disappointed with this newest film in the franchise. But, if you have enjoyed the Mission Impossible and Bourne Identity movies, you'll love Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.<br /><br />This newest (oldest?) adventure of Bond is actually the first story in the series, explaining how he came to earn his 007 status, as well as some of the experiences that led to the smooth operator we've seen in previous movies. This Bond (Daniel Craig) is hard, arrogant, and brutal. He has no soul and has shut off all emotion, as he must do to be an effective killer - and this is at least one reason which explains his many sexual exploits without connection or personal meaning to the many \\"Bond girls\\" we've come to know through the past 20 movies.<br /><br />The plot of Casino Royale is a bit difficult to follow, as it jumps from bad guy to bad guy, until settling upon Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkleson), a banker who uses terrorist money to play the stock market. While Le Chiffre is creepy with a cloudy eye that weeps blood, he's not the evil villain we've seen in previous Bond movies. When James foils his plot to blow up an airplane, Le Chiffre loses $100 million and therefore, sets up a high stakes poker game to win back his losses and pay back his clients. Of course, Mr. Bond gets in on the action.<br /><br />This is one of the slowest parts of the movie, as it's hard to make a 2-day poker game exciting. Typically, we see this type of scene placed at the end of a movie, as the climax to the plot. In Casino Royale, the card game is in the middle of this 2½ hour LONG movie. The story then moves on to Bond falling in love with the MI6 accountant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), only to jump back into the previous storyline (just when you think it's over, it starts all over again). While the love story is nice, it is really unnecessary and out of place. We are supposed to be convinced that this hard, cold killer is softened by this vulnerable woman and willing to quit the spy business altogether, all in the matter of two days. Unlikely.<br /><br />While Bond movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, the plot just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Once Le Chiffre is found, why isn't he taken into custody? What was the purpose of playing the card game, just to arrest him at the end? Much of what Bond does, especially at the beginning, is unexplained, and his abilities are unbelievable. The characters lack depth, are predictable, and really aren't that likeable. Except, I must say, Daniel Craig does an excellent job of being a hard, mean, brutal killer. Most of the movie he sports numerous cuts on his hands and face, and many of the fight scenes and murders are ugly and graphic. He is focused and determined.<br /><br />Unlike previous Bond movies, Casino Royale does not employ the use of interesting gadgets. Q and Moneypenny are missing from the story as well, with the only other familiar character being M (Judi Dench). M isn't so impressed with Bond, calling him a \\"blunt instrument\\" at one point, as he lacks refinement and discretion. He's such a loose cannon, she has a tracking device inserted into the inside of his wrist and has someone watching over him the rest of his assignment. Not quite the James Bond you expect to see, but by the end of the movie he has begun to show some of the qualities we have come to know in James Bond.<br /><br />MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:<br /><br />If you like action movies, you will undoubtedly enjoy this one, but don't go expecting to see what we've seen in Sean Connery, Roger Moore orPierce Brosnan. This is a new James Bond, re-invented for a new, harder-edged audience.<br /><br />Additionally, it is unbelievable that the movie is rated PG-13, as it really should be R for the torture scene specifically. This movie is for adults and older teens.<br /><br />AFTER THE SHOW:<br /><br />* What did you like or dislike about the new James Bond?

B00005JLPK|5.0|This is a great movie about Frida Kahlo. There are some details fudged or fictionalized a bit, for sake of moving the story along smoothly, but you get to the heart of the story pretty well. The cast is great, and I'm so glad Salma Hayek did this instead of Madonna. Alfred Molina is fantastic as Diego Rivera, and the supporting cast is excellent. It's also a beautiful, visual film, with wonderful flourishes, such as Kahlo's paintings coming to life onscreen. The budget wasn't high for the movie, but you can see what creativity and passion for the subject can do. It's beautiful to see and the music is great, too.

B000001A3H|5.0|Kyuss does have a greatest hits album, and it's solid, but it doesn't hold a torch to Blues for the Red Sun.  Kyuss has always been pegged as a \\"jam band,\\" but that doesn't really do them justice.  How many riff bands invent a new genre of music? <br />Kyuss are the original stoners, and this album is a fan favourite for good reason.  John Garcia, one of metal's most tragically unsung heroes, just wails on this record.  Unlike today's whiny, sobbing emo and nu- metal- types, Jon Garcia can SING.  He's got an almost definitive rock and roll voice. <br />Of course Josh Homme on guitar and backup vocals is a big part of why Kyuss rock- he's the Midas of heavy metal music.  But this record is really propelled by Garcia on vocals.  Check him out on Danko Jones's new record, Sleep Is the Enemy.  The man's a genius!

B000G8NXZK|5.0|Next to \\"All About Eve,\\" Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL is the best movie of all time.  This Criterion Box set has it all, every version, including the botched \\"family friendly\\" version edited for American TV.  Gilliam takes George Orwell's story of 1984 turns it upside down and inside out creating a masterpiece of dark comedy and horor that you won't soon forget.  Many people who have seen BRAZIL only one time really haven't seen it at all.  This DVD is a keeper to watch again and again.  Katherine Helmond is priceless, (\\"I know simply everybody!\\") and Johnathon Pryce as the \\"fool in love\\" Lowry gives a heartbreaking but brilliant performance.  Robert DeNiro as a renegade plummer gives a smashing cameo performance.  Although Gilliam says that BRAZIL should not be compared to political events happening in the world today, it's kind of ironic due to all the similarities...you be the judge.

0618680004|5.0|This book is under sustained assault from the religious \\"right\\" for good reason. It is a strongly argued attack on all forms of supernatural belief. It's value isn't in persuading strong believers to abandon faith (there's not a lot that can be done to convince delusional minds...not even hard evidence), but in helping the waverers and agnostics to move away from belief. At the heart of the book is a simple logic - just taking Christians, Jews and Muslims (from amongst a whole group of religions), each believes their God is the one God who, when revered and worshipped will grant passage to a wondrous afterlife. Each religion declares other Gods as fake. Dawkins just goes one God further. For all the reasons that Christians might disregard other Gods, Dawkins disregards theirs. <br /> <br />The section on the book that deals with Intelligent Design is a brilliant piece of logic and analysis. Buy this book and also \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" by Sam Harris and then pass them on to all your friends.

The book is interesting to read and the Major Arcana are familiar and romantic. <br />The minor Arcana could be more original, they're another version of Rider-Waite. <br />The deck suggest a path that I found more masculine oriented, it could be a great present to a male tarot-reader. <br /> <br />Blessings <br />:) <br />CofS <br />
B0006Z2LCE|4.0|There are now a huge choice of Donna Summer compilations so this one is for completists as it contains different versions of certain tracks. These were all singles, major and minor hits, without any of her classic album tracks that made some of her albums, like Bad Girls, so special. From the 1970s comes the erotic Love To Love You Baby, Could It Be Magic, Last Dance from the disco movie Thank God It's Friday, the lilting Love's Unkind, the majestic MacArthur Park and No More Tears, the duet with Streisand. And her brilliant and original fusion of disco and rock in the form of Hot Stuff and Bad Girls, two of the very best songs of 1979 in any genre.<br /><br />The next decade she changed her style, creating great pop songs like Love Is In Control, the anthemic State Of Independence, the rock-pop She Works Hard For The Money, the bouncy Unconditional Love, a collaboration with Musical Youth, and then a return to dance in the late 80s style with the brilliant All Systems Go and This Time I Know It's For Real. The track When Love Cries and the following are from the 1990s and the 2000s and include the classic I Will Go With You. Although this is a good collection of her singles, I give it four stars since the perfect compilation would include some of those aforementioned album tracks like My Baby Understands, Our Love and Lucky (all from Bad Girls) and at least one track from her Christmas album.
0446528056|3.0|I am an avid Nicholas Spark's reader - i love his books. I was so excited to read Dear John. But i found myself so depressed after reading this book. It's a great story and very well written, but just like his last, this one leaves you sad and wishing the ending were different. I know they can't all end happily, but hopefully the next one will.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|I would like to start my review by stating that I never really watched the original series on which this film is based, but I know for a fact the movie is a huge turn-around from the show. There are no more light tunes, flamingos, multi-colored suits, or sunny beaches. The Mann directed version is a gritty yet exaggerated look into the lives of undercover police officers and what they risk. This film focuses on two Miami cops, Crockett ( a surprise turn for Colin Farrell) and Tubbs (a great-as-usual part for Jamie Foxx), who are asked to infiltrate a world-wide drug ring by posing as transporters. As the pair complete more jobs Crockett begins to fall for the head cartel's wife, Isabella(Li Gong). As the relationship continues, the Cartel's partner, Jose Yero, becomes more jealous and untrusting of the undercover duo. He decides to turn the table on their operations and take over the Cartel's business. Yero pressures Tubbs' and Crockett's personal lives until a final duel is inevitable... <br />    Because this is a Michael Mann film, loud and realistic shootouts, beautiful cinematography(many different locales including Miami during hurricane season), a diversified score(mellow piano instrumental mixed with hard rock/pop/salsa), and a tight script are inevitable. However, what really drew me to this film was the slow suspenseful build up to the loud climax. Tubbs and Crockket start off well, but their identities slowly are lost in the confusion of multiple duties and personalities. The unrated version adds a few scenes including an opening shot of a boat race during credits, and an emotional fight in a car between Crockett and his love Isabella. The special features are so-so, but the additional scenes and movie quality make up for the few complaints. A \\"love it or hate it\\" film, Miami Vice will no doubt stun any fan of crime-suspense dramas or Michael Mann.

B00005JPGM|4.0|BLOOD DIAMOND wants to illustrate the tangled, multi-national, disgraceful state of \\"Conflict Diamonds\\"...diamonds that are mined in war-torn countries, where countrymen are randomly killed or thrown in slavery, all over the desire by one warring faction or another to control the diamond trade.  They are supposed to be illegal in most of the world, but the movie reminds us that it's a pretty simple matter of paying a few bribes to the right folks after smuggling the diamonds to a \\"legal\\" country.  This is where the movie stumbles the most.  It's political messages are presented in little speeches peppered throughout the film, in a manner that stops the pace of the film.  One need only remember how well THE CONSTANST GARDNER wove similar subject matter into the very fabric of its being.  Take politics out of GARDNER and there'd have been no film left.  Take them out of BLOOD DIAMOND, and you'd have a rip-roaring action movie (and a MUCH smaller role for Jennifer Connelly). <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an amoral diamond smuggler, pretty much willing to kill anyone who stands in his way (he was a mercenary, so knows his way around guns).  Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vendy, a poor fisherman whose path crosses with DiCaprio when Solomon finds a rare, huge \\"blood diamond\\" and DiCaprio gets wind of it.  Solomon's son has been kidnapped by brutal rebels, and his only interest is to get his son back.  DiCaprio convinces Solomon he can help, but only agrees to do so if Solomon will lead him to the diamond. <br /> <br />Accompanying them on their journey is journalist Jennifer Connelly, who gets to spout much of the political rhetoric of the movie, especially early on.  The three travel through a brutal and violent landscape.  In many ways, the movie is like a Saturday-morning movie serial, moving from one close call to another...but it's all extremely violent.  Lots and lots of women and children callously cut down in the film.  We see children killing andbeing killed. <br /> <br />As I said, I found the political \\"message\\" to be less than compelling as drama.  But the drama of the movie...the action, if you will, is well staged and makes up for much of the rest.  Edward Zwick, who did such a great job with GLORY and a pretty good job, I thought, with THE LAST SAMURAI, is clearly aiming for an \\"important\\" film here...but in the end it's a violent, gory, terrifying, exciting action film.  I don't mean to dismiss the plight of the people in Africa.  It IS very disturbing to be aware of what's going on...and that's good.  However, as filmmaking, the filmmakers didn't quite work out how to dramatize the message. <br /> <br />I would say the script probably failed them.  The editing, cinematography, landscapes and especially the actors and the ACTION are all first-rate.  But the words the actors have to spout are often wince-inducingly non-human.   <br /> <br />DiCaprio is all the way back now as one of our great actors.  After TITANIC, he briefly fell into the role of hard-partying idiot and somewhat fell out of favor.  He returned to serious filmwork in GANGS OF NEW YORK, but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN was more successful for him, but his acting chops were somewhat dismissed due to the frivolous nature of the film.  THE AVIATOR got him an Oscar nod, but somehow the public didn't really embrace it.  But this year, with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, there is no doubting anymore that he is an actor of considerable skill.  His spotty South African accent aside (it's one of the toughest accents to replicate...seriously), he is first rate.  He's really a bad guy with charm, and the fact that we feel mostly on his side through the film, even though he's killing people left and right, is a testament to his charm. <br /> <br />Jennifer Connelly, in a poorly written role, always looks great, and staring with roughly the middle of the film, her character begins to connect with the audience, and we start to like her.   Her final \\"scene\\" with DiCaprio would have been cloying in the hands of other performers, but they both pull it off. <br /> <br />And Djimon Hounsou is always a mighty presence.  He was great in AMISTAD, Oscar nominated for IN AMERICA, and truly in his element in BLOOD DIAMOND.  He's an African born actor, and in this film he's truly in his element.  He has a real sense of the pace and lifestyle of the region, and it comes across very well.  His role is written to make him a very saintly character, and again, in less able hands, might have been truly one-dimensional.  I wish more people were seeing this film, if only to see him. <br /> <br />So, overall I recommend the film.  It's never boring, though occasionally frustrating.  It is NOT for the kids, though. The violence is graphic, constant and inflicted on truly innocent people.  But if you want adult entertainment with lots of action and don't mind a sheen of \\"message,\\" you'll be pleased. <br />

First, I read some other reviewers reviews of this movie and they don't explain something. What happend to that guys face? It made me sad that the mean lady was mean to him on the boat just because his face is different than hers. She is an ugly, mean lady.<br /><br />My favorite parts are about the camera belt and the oily shoes that squirt oil on the log. How come I wish i had some of those so I could use them on my little sister when she is anoying me.<br /><br />One question I still have is I wonder if they will ever fix his face with the money from the buried treasures? I watched it again to see if they did because I couldn't remember. THey saved the town.

B000FZDMSM|5.0|This is the last of the studio recordings of King Crimson. It is much better than the previous \\"the construkction of light\\", and probably is the best king crimson record in 10 years. The song \\"the power to believe part 2\\" is one of its best songs ever. <br />I have the normal (european) recording, and I bought this japanese edition because in some photographs of the backcover it was catalogued as an HDCD recording. The disc is NOT HDCD encoded though maybe it sounds marginally better. It is not the fault of amazon or the sellers, since they do not advertise it like an HDCD recording. It is the fault of the japanese company that advertise incorrectly in the back cover. Many other king Crimson recordings are HDCD, and with the proper cd player it is an evident improvement in the sound.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|I think this movie is great.  I find it exceptionally funny.  If you look, you'll notice that you never once see someone smoke a cigarette during the movie.
0743457900|5.0|The best aspect of this book is that it is realistic and thrilling at the same time. If you read nonfiction cold war espionage stories, you find that stuff like this actually did happen. Le Carre gives you a look at the actual workings of spycraft and the techniques that were used during the cold war.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of several different people in turns, but never from the perspective of the antagonists, so the author doesn't give away what the other side is doing until the protagonists themselves find out. Even though it is a third-person narrative approach, it mainly sticks with a couple characters (Guillam and Smiley), and the author doesn't actually reveal the thoughts of any characters except Guillam and Smiley.<br /><br />Even though I also gave Absolute Friends 5 stars, this book is a little bit better, mainly because in Tinker Tailor the solutions to all the puzzles (or most of them anyway) are satisfactorily revealed in the end, and the ending is not excessivley clever, which is a weakness of many thriller novels (including Absolute Friends and The Spy Who Came in From the Cold).<br /><br />Be warned, however: the story is complicated, and Le Carre does not explain everything for you.  You are expected to make a lot of inferences. It can be fun to have to work at understanding what is going on, but if you are the type of person who doesn't like to have to turn back the pages frequently to try to make sense of the story, this may not be for you. It is the kind of book you have to read slowly. There are so many characters to keep track of that you might even need to take some notes, especially if you are going to put the book down for a while before coming back to it. Never fear, however: your hard work will not be in vain. The puzzles are actually worth the effort.<br /><br />One thing that was sometimes unnecessarily frustrating was Le Carre's use of terminology that would be familiar to spies (and to devoted fans of espionage literature) but which is not known to most lay-people--especially those who are not British. For the most part, you can figure out what these terms mean from the context, but it would have been nice to have a glossary of British spy jargon or something.<br /><br />Suggestions for other books:<br />If you want a more modern espionage/mystery novel, try The Prisoner of Guantanamo by Fesperman, which has the same high quality and realism as le Carre's books.<br />Barry Eisler is good if you are looking for an author who leans slightly more towards action and thrills, but not so much that it is unbelievable. (although they may be slightly less realistic, his books are still quite plausible).

0195067142|5.0|E. B. Sledge wrote one of the best war memoirs to come out of WWII, or any other war.  Not as \\"intellectual\\" as William Manchester's more literary \\"Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War.\\"  But perhaps more powerful for its more simple, straight forward, narrative.<br /><br />I recommend both books for anyone wanting to better understand \\"what it was really like.\\"  But I believe that Sledge's presentation of the Okinawa campaign gets the reader closer to the real horror of war.<br /><br />On the lighter side, Sledge's discussion of the land crabs and other amenities of Pavuvu reminded me of some of the \\"war stories\\" I have heard from other 1st Mar Div veterans of that famous Marine Corps \\"battle\\" for which no combat ribbons were awarded.

B00005JKJA|5.0|My second favorite David Lynch film next to Fire Walk With Me explorers the contrast between nightmare/real life and the fantastic/mundane with great acting and directing. Naomi Watts shines in two different roles and I am always amazed by her acting. Lynch abandons much of the dark humor of his Twin Peaks period and proves he can do it either way.    (FYI: He played it straight with FWWM also {a departure from the series} - many were burned out on Lynch at the time this film came out and should see it again - his best and the best, most frightening horror film ever made IMHO.)

0618551050|5.0|Don't let the long title fool you. This is one of the finest works explaining physics and the academic world in which physicists live and work I have ever read! Some of the new stuff being worked on and the fundamental foundational questions being pondered is really cool and not easily accessed as this is the first I've heard of most of the ideas discussed. A clear look and explanation of string and M theory help me understand WHY I had a hard time understanding them in the first place because string theory is actually a multitude of theories (which I knew as just five) on the level of infinite and M theory is the supposed \\"Mother or Mystery\\" theory behind it while in reality having not even a rough skeleton of a theory and no predictions to falsify! <br /> <br />I'm sure Smolin pissed off a lot of academics with this book but he made every effort to be fair and logical. Toward the end of the book he offers a few ways in which we can change the current mindset towards supporting the revolutionaries rather than marginalizing them as the current structure encourages. <br /> <br />A must read for anyone interested in physics. This is the fourth book I've read by Smolin and with each one I become more impressed not by his genius but by his ability to allow me to visualize the concept with excellent descriptions and finely written and edited work. Many works on this topic tend to be sloppy in the technical writing or lacking in the ability to maintain interest because of too much technical over theoretical and a bad case of \\"dryness.\\" <br />
B0000VCZK2|5.0|this is a great package.  you get both the original theatrical releases and the extended cuts of all 4 movies.  even though the last movie sucks out-loud, it is still worth it to buy this set for the first three movies.  i couldnt find an alien3 extended cut and the extended cuts for alien, and aliens were both over $20 each.  great value, classic, must have movies, great packaging.  well worth the money, and worth having to buy the last horrible alien movie.

B00003CXBK|5.0|In ancient Japan, a cursed prince travels to a land where men and the gods of nature struggle to define their positions in a newly emerging world order.  Exquisite animation is to be expected in a film by Hayao Miyazaki, and he does not disappoint here.  But this film also delivers his most profound moral statement in a story that does not feature simple heroes and villains.  The human drive to control the environment and improve the quality of life, in the form of Lady Eboshi's ironworks, upsets the balance of nature, but there is more to her than that.  The lepers who make her rifles are grateful for the good treatment they receive from her, and the workers in her factory are prostitutes that she has rescued from the brothels.  Her desire to slay the gods of the forest with her rifles and iron bullets is a potent metaphor for man's drive to conquer nature with technology.  The creatures of the forest are not simplistic good guys, either.  They can be violent and are in danger of being transformed into demons by their rage.  This complex film is a joy to watch and has the power of myth.
0446677450|5.0|\\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is one of the best books that I have read on personal financial management. I grew up where I was thoroughly schooled on the virtue of the need to go to school, get good grades, proceed to university, and get a good degree. From there, the money issues will take care of themselves. I followed this advice from my parents and teachers to the letter and now boast several degrees.<br /><br />Although I greatly value the education and training that I have received and enjoy the work I do, I have tended to be very risk averse. I am among those that are sensible enough to know the value of spending money wisely and save some for the future. However, I have always been very happy enough to save my money with banks (especially investing in treasury bills) where I have received interest ranging from 4-6 percent per annum. I also have a balanced portfolio of stocks, as I was schooled during my MBA, to spread my investment risk instead of focusing on some few well evaluated risky assets with extraordinary returns.<br /><br />From the wisdom that I have gathered from Kiyosaki and Lechter, I am now on my way to building asset columns that should yield excellent returns. I have had to change my mindset (not very easy in my 40 something years of age), readjust my asset portfolio and focus on building my asset column using the expertise I gathered from this wonderful book. I only wish that I had read this book several years ago, but it is never too late. I am happy that my kids will have the benefit of real financial education that should be useful to their future.<br /><br />As I say good bye to my middle class status, I can only encourage others to read this book, spread the knowledge particularly to their kids and get out of the rat race and let money work for you and not the other way
0804836272|3.0|When I saw this book, (quite by accident, actually), I was impressed that here was a book on something that I had never even heard of before. So, the expectation was high.<br /><br />Hillsborough has tried to bring out the spirit of the organisation without getting bogged down in the details. Actually, it was the details that I was looking for and often the details will give you something of the spirit of the subject anyway. Some of the historical detail was there, and Hillsborough certainly came across as one who knew his subject material and sources. However, with his book being the first in English on the topic, I question whether the deliberate focus away from the said details was justified. For the average non-Japanese, that historical data would have been priceless, as most of us have nothing else about the Shinsengumi to read.<br /><br />Three phrases were repeated and repeated ad nauseum: \\"propensity to kill\\", \\"will to power\\" and \\"self-importance\\". The latter had some variations, but all three are constantly hammered and drummed into the reader. At one point, the first phrase appears in almost every sentence for about two paragraphs. While it is certainly worthy to explore the motivations of anyone of historical importance, I again question whether the point needed to be laboured to the degree that it was.<br /><br />A lot of the historical information regarding important incidents involving the Shinsengumi read a bit like a medieval version of \\"Battle Royale\\". At one point, I wondered if I were indeed reading a \\"historical novel\\" rather than a book on history. This is something to keep in mind, if you are thinking of purchasing the book.<br /><br />While the book was interesting, it was certainly not fantastic. It left a huge number of unanswered questions and also left me wondering just why the Shinsengumi was feared so much. From what the book described, there were far more vicious individuals around. That information would have gone a long way to create an understanding of just why the Shinsengumi were so feared and hated.<br /><br />It is an average book, though with nothing else that I know of in English, there is little choice if someone wants to know about the topic. The Shinsengumi are interesting and worth the look, so for that reason alone the book is worth getting.

B00005JP9V|4.0|Many of the bleak scenarios presented in this thought provoking film, like demonization and persecution of \\"illegal\\" immigrants, are well underway today.  Granted, they haven't reached the fever pitch level displayed in the movie, but that's just a formality - we're not that far away from the dark landscape of CHILDREN OF MEN.   <br /> <br />I found myself drawing so many comparisons to modern day society as I watched the film.  The enviromental decay depicted in it made me think of what we are currently doing to our planet; a protest march through an immigrant concentration camp made me think of the current Palestinian crisis; random klllings of people interned in the camp as they attempted to run across a street reminded me of similar killings in Sarajevo, Bosnia during the height of its ethnic war; the abundance of dogs everywhere in the film as companions to lonely people reminded me of New York City, where so many people have dogs in tiny little apartments to cope with their lonliness (in a city of 8 million), etc.   <br /> <br />I've often felt artists are the great prophets of society.  They create work based on what knaws at their souls, not based on loyalties to religious, poliitical, or ethnic ties.  The futuristic scenario presented in CHILDREN OF MEN is a futuristic vision as seen through the apocalyptic lens of a masterful filmmaker.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I am pretty much your typical american consumer.  Previously I saw my mission in life as the following: become a doctor, serve the poor.  Other people can take care of the environment, animal rights, etc.  Maybe it's not the greatest movie in the world, but it changed my life and I finally understand what global warming really is (ie it's not just about polar bears, it really is the immediate future, and I owe it to the world around me to be a responsible consumer).  Since the viewing this movie, I have made the following changes: <br /> <br />1. No more individual coke, water, or sports drink bottles. <br />2. I will not be able to give up starbucks (location is at the hospital I work), so I bought a starbucks plastic mug which they fill for me every morning - so no more coffee cups in the trash.  I use that same cup for water and tea during the day. <br />3. I will never buy another car that gets less than 40 miles to the gallon.   <br />4. I turned my thermostat down to 68 degrees (from 70).  Although we haven't really needed the heater this year at all. <br />6. I am finally on board with my husband's quest to recycle in a place that doesn't really make it easy to recycle (cincinnati/northern kentucky) as well as his little compost project. <br />7. My goal is to pass the dvd on to 100 people over the next 6 months who otherwise woudln't have seen it. Maybe they will make some changes too
1423407261|4.0|this one surprised me, it said 'a paperback' but i knew there is a c.d. of this title.  \\"aha!\\"  this is the score of the songs (i.e. the written music).  if i were doing more than \\"just listening\\" these days, i would be buying the book and playing and singing the songs for myself.
B00005MEW1|4.0|Alright, first off I'm not some kind of black eyeliner wearing goth lover who enjoys being depressed all the time. I am a fan of classic horror and there is no greater originator of classic horror than Nosferatu. Here we have a version with an updated score consisting of three minute fragments of not nessisarily heavy metal gothic music but just overall errie sounding. I liked it. As far as the movie goes I've read that there are better coppies out there but unfortunaltly I have been unable to find one where certain parts are not cropped. Still, a teriffic movie even if Barbra Strisand had done the score which might actually be scarier.
B000H305U0|4.0|THIS CD WAS ALOT BETTER THAN HIS LAST ONE BUT IT WAS NOT THE BEST I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR.  I BELIEVE THAT HE MADE VERY GOOD CHOICES WHEN COLABORATING WITH OTHERS AND THE BEATS ARE FRESH.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />Salma Hayek captures the enigmatic essence of artist Frida Kahlo and Alfred Molina gives a fine performance as husband, compadre, and artist Diego Rivera. I was equally amazed with Geoffrey Rush's performance as Leon Trotsky.<br /><br />The movie chronicles Frida's life and together we share her struggles as well as her courage and triumphs. We understand how she transferred pain to the canvas. It was Frida's coping mechanism. We learn something of the history of Mexico and the world at that time. And we cheer for a group of people who wanted to make the world a better place.<br /><br />In one scene, Frida, Diego, Leon Trotsky, and friends are sitting around the dinner table discussing politics. The scene was electrically charged with an esprit de corps - created by the actors and no doubt pulled from the characters.<br /><br />The soundtrack is one I listen to again and again. Lila Downs sings \\"La Llorona\\" with Mariachi Juvenil de Tecalitlan at the end of the movie - for Frida's Exhibition. It's an significant moment and a powerful way to conclude a wonderful story.

B00005ASOI|4.0|If you are a new horror fan and haven't seen this film (well-established horror fiends have already seen this multiple times), you owe it to yourself to witness a classic.<br /><br />You can read the plot in other reviews and in the synopsis provided above.  The plot doesn't matter much, though, because Argento's film is more like a dream than a standard narrative.  One of the last (if not the last) film done in this style Technicolor, and one of the first horror movies to really utilize the soundtrack to its full potential, this masterpiece of horror (often imitated, never duplicated -- despite persistent rumors of a remake) remains a nightmare long after you've reached the credits.<br /><br />Argento is stylish beyond compare, and none of his films showcase it as well as this one does.  (And this film isn't even my favorite Argento film -- that would be \\"The Stendhal Syndrome\\").  With it, he established himself as a horror master and visionary.  No wonder he's influenced everyone from Tarantino to various Japanese horror directors.  (The Japanese really loved this film.)<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, buy it today.  You won't sleep well the night you watch it, but that's a small price to pay for greatness.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Among the novels Jane Austen wrote, this is my favorite.  Although the heroine is not young nor brilliant like Elizabeth in the Pride and Prejudice, Anne is thoughtful and discrete. Amanda Root played Anne very well. As the story progresses she becomes prettier and prettier.  She finally collects all her courage and stands up for her own happiness and get her man.  The actor who plays Captain Wentworth is also good, strong built, but sensitive enough to know what kind of a woman Anne is.  These British actors can make Jane Austen stories alive even today.
B00008I8IF|5.0|As the probable swansong of The Jayhawks, this album was a welcome return to the classic form that made them the cult favorites of fans of the elusive Alt-Country genre.  Stunning melodies and soaring harmonies... check.  Bittersweet melancholy... check.  Love, loss, heartbreak... check.   <br /> <br />The only dispute I have with the glowing reviews of this album are with the couple that alluded to simplistic lyrics... while Louis certainly never displays the lyrical pyrotechnics of Dylan or early Springsteen, say, his lyrics consistently demostrate a powerful allusive quality that hint at deeper meanings, as in this passage from \\"Stumbling...\\" <br /> <br />Everybody's stumbling through the dark. <br />The men that preceded us here <br />Left only questions and fear <br />The vanity formed by beauty lies -  <br />You know it's a crime.    <br /> <br />I am grateful to have caught the 'hawks LIVE (opening band was The Thorns, who joined them for an encore of \\"Blue\\"!), and I hope that Gary and boys will one day see fit to come out and play some of these songs and the others in their terrific body of work.
032147404X|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. A lot of useful ideas on various aspects of digital photography. Centers around both Nikon and Canon cameras. <br />Worthwhile!
B00003CXZ3|5.0|An unbelievably astonishing plot, constructed so that it makes perfect sense in spite of being told backwards, starting at the end, and ending at the beginning.  All the facts about memory functions of the brain are scientifically accurate and well represented in the dialog.  I found the film to be utterly absorbing and interesting throughout.  All characters are thoroughly believable because the entire cast does such an excellent job.  Guy Pearce is perfect!  This film is so fascinating that I find myself watching again and again!  The only improvement I could suggest would be to announce on screen \\"3 hours earlier\\" or \\"the day before\\" or whatever to help distinguish between scene cuts that move forward in time and those that start at an earlier time.  It took me 3 viewings to fully comprehend the plot!  But I still think it is a great movie!  I love it!
B00005JM20|4.0|\\"Johnny English\\" is a completely unnecessary film, and seems to know it.  Virtually no effort has been made to make this movie anything other than an excuse to watch Rowan Atkinson make a complete fool of himself for 80 minutes.  The question you must ask yourself before watching this movie is, is that enough?  <br /> <br />For me, the answer is yes.  I can't explain why - I just find Atkinson to be hysterical.  His scene as the priest in \\"4 Weddings and a Funeral\\" is the funniest in that hilarious movie, and his brief moments in \\"Love Actually\\" steal a movie that doesn't want to be stolen.  Others will disagree with those sentiments, and those folks should probably steer clear of \\"Johnny English.\\"  <br /> <br />Do we need another James Bond spoof?  Probably not.  Do we need a movie in which a beautiful woman makes a comment to Atkinson, and his response includes the terms, \\"plastic toys\\" and \\"soft cheese\\"?  I sure did - I had to pause the movie I was laughing so hard.  So for me, the experience of watching Atkinson play a bumbling James Bond figure was wonderful, even though I know the movie isn't a \\"good\\" film.   <br /> <br />Maybe that's part of its charm.  John Malkovich, one of the great actors working today, also seems to know he's in a bad movie.  So he plays the French villain badly, like he's in on the joke.  That's the kind of self-awareness that makes \\"Johnny English\\" at worst a harmless trifle, and at best a funny silly comedy.
B000002KOJ|5.0|Joni Mitchell never stood still in her prodigious recording career, and an argument could be made that any number of those records are her finest, or most influential, or best embodies her artistic essence.  Clouds is the second album she released.  Her first, Songs for a Seagull is hauntingly beautiful, and yet seems a little tentative, perhaps a little measured as well.  For those who have had a chance to see the documentary \\"Woman of Heart and Mind\\" the vibrant artist who appears on the early tapes from Canadian television is the confident voice we hear on Clouds.  It contains the best of the many songs she composed while still in relative obscurity, before settling into LA's Laurel Canyon.  Chelsea Morning, I Don't Know Where I Stand and Gallery retain an innocence and vulnerability that are fated to recede with success and life's experiences.   Songs for Aging Children and the Fiddle and the Drum represent the last remnants of 60's culture that for better or worse was destined for retreat. <br /> <br />Both Sides Now is obviously the key bridge at life's changes, a beautiful anthem of resolve, even as it grieves with regret, as the myth of youthful ideal is tempered with the rationalization of adult compromise.  \\"Something's lost, but something's gained\\" she sings, but the tone is one of grit, not celebration.  The dreamer has awoken. <br /> <br />Clouds appeal to the romantic side of us in it's purest sense.  This is the Joni Mitchell I love the most, the frail angel who will shortly morph into a less ethereal, but more worldly soul.  At least I can still play these songs so that this aging child can enjoy the occasional respite of his youthful dreams. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000025H6|2.0|I have been a Pink Floyd fan for many years and have had this album for a long period of time.   However,  I have had problems trying to come up with words to describe how I feel about this album.  This album is a very self-serving Roger Waters album and shows the Floyd going into a completely different direction.   I can say with confidence that this album should never had the \\"Pink Floyd\\" name attached to it as for most of this album we can tell that the only force present on the CD was Roger Waters.   There are some classic sounding Floyd songs on here:  Comfortably Numb (wonderful piece of music with some powerful lyrics), Another Brick in the Wall (all three parts), Hey You and Run Like Hell.   However, there were some songs that I felt were not classic Floyd:  The Trial is an absolute self-serving piece of crap from Roger Waters and not worthy of any Pink Floyd album.  Waiting for Worms,  One of My Turns, Empty Spaces, Stop, Don't Leave Me Now also do not have the classic sounds of Pink Floyd but rather sounds of a Roger Waters solo album.  In the Flesh?, Goodbye Blue Sky, and Young Lust are great songs...but not Floyd songs.  This album  as a collection was very painful for this classic Pink Floyd fan to listen to.  I think I have managed to listen to this album from first track to last only about 3 or 4 times over the last 15 years. <br /> <br />Musicianship of Nick Mason and Richard Wright were painfully missing on this album and sadly missed. Although David Gilmour did contribute to three songs on the album, the others really did not contribute much to this Waters' madness album.   This album led to the brief departure of Richard Wright as a member of Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />In terms of classic rock operas, yes, The Wall will be one of the greatest classic rock albums of all time....however, as a Pink Floyd album....this is nothing more than a self-serving Roger Waters production and should have been a solo album of Roger Waters.   Pink Floyd was a collective, and that collective was definitely missing on this album. <br /> <br />If we were talking about a Roger Waters album, this would definitely get more stars from me.   But this was branded a Pink Floyd album and it was the album that, quite frankly in my honest opinion, almost destroyed Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Very painful to listen to for this Floyd fan.  My wife, also a Pink Floyd fan, put this as one of her least favourite Pink Floyd albums.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This film is one of my top 5 favorite films of all time.<br /><br />Let me make a few things clear just so you know what value that statement has.<br /><br />I may be a hopeless romantic, but I rarely watch romance films, because they always seem too frustrating.<br /><br />I am a hopelessly cynical film critic.<br /><br />That being said, this is probably the best romance film to come out of Hollywood in the last 50 years.<br /><br />The storyline follows an American woman, Kate, who has moved to Canada but is not yet a citizen there, with her fiance. Kate hates to fly, in fact she never flies to the extent that the first thing you see is her attempting to get comfortable with flying. Her fiance, Charlie, has to go  to a business conference in Paris, France. Though without much conflict, he goes alone, Kate being unable to conquer her fear of flying.<br /><br />Several days later, Charlie calls her and confesses through his drunken stupor that he isn't coming back and he has found someone else.<br /><br />Kate makes a decision, bites her lip, and buys a ticket on the next flight to Paris. With the help of an odd Frenchmen named Luc (Pronounced Y-uc) Teyssier, she manages to cross into Paris, and thus begins her valiant journey to reclaim the man she loves. What she doesn't know is that Luc is a thief, and a good one at that, and while he hides a valuable diamond necklace in her bag, the wild romp through France begins.<br /><br />This movie is one of those movies that will dazzle you EVERY time you see it. And its also the kind of movie where you pick up new things almost every time you see it. The acting is so superb, the music is wonderful, and the scenery cannot be more picturesque.<br /><br />This is the perfect movie to watch with the one you love, and I recommend it to anyone with a heart.
B000002U9W|4.0|Although band members thought the album was a disaster, I quite like this album.   Being an instrumental fanatic, I did like the choir and the orchestra on Atom Heart Mother; it help add some depth to the instrumental.   Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast (was this for engineer, and later musician Alan Parsons?) is quite an interesting instrumental.  It is a lot different from instrumentals that the Floyd released. <br /> <br />The others songs sandwiched between these two instrumentals are quite pleasant to listen to, and a vast improvement from their Saucerful of Secrets album.  If, is lyrically strong, and its music is wonderful to listen to.  Summer '68 is definitely the best of the three songs.  Richard Wright's vocals are very good (he rarely sings full lead on future albums) and was great to listen to.   Fat Old Sun is a bit of a disappointment but still a good song (I understand, however, why David Gilmour thought it was awful!  It is definitely not one of his better songs he contributed to the Floyd!) <br /> <br />This album paves the way for the Meddle album which is an outstanding album and shows the beginning of a great run of albums from Pink Floyd.  This is a good prequel to Meddle.
B00080Z53O|5.0|This story is about a couragous man, Ramon Sampedro, who became a quadraplegic due to a diving accident. 28 years later he choses to end his life because he can no longer live imprisoned in a useless body. He is tired of depending on others and yet he loves his family and those around him who did so much to make his life meaningful. Initially, he hires a lawyer to bring his case to court, to try to end his life legally. His lawyer is a woman, Julia, who has a disability which the viewer later learns is a chronic debilitating heart condition. She empathizes with Ramon's situation and begins to appreciate his finer qualities as she delves into his past and how it affects him when disabled. She wants to understand him as a total human being, not just a person with a handicap. Ramon also develops a relationship with another woman named Rose, who learns of his plight and visits him often.  She becomes the person who perhaps comes closest to meeting his emotional needs ...<br /><br />The film is shot artistically and realistically ... Alejandro Amendabar, the film producer, director, and creater of the musical score did a fabulous job of making a film which tackles a difficult subject - euthanasia. He made a film which shows the dignity of a human being who had a serious health problem, who made a conscious decision which few around him could accept. The personality of Ramon shines within this film. Javier Bardem plays Ramon showing a person who has a sense of humor as well as all human traits. Most amazing is how Javier Bardem holds his body stiffly, keeps his hands contracted, and his back arched, looking exactly like a paralyzed person. The views outside Ramon's window are stunning ... When he daydreams of flying and having a fully functioning body, the scenery of the mountains, streams, and shoreline of the beach are spectacular.<br /><br />The ethics and conflicts which Ramon faces are felt by his family and everyone associated with his case. Julia and her assistant review the current laws and recognize the challenges which they will be facing when his case is brought to court. They want Ramon to go before the judges and explain his views ... believing in person he may sway them to understand his plight. Ramon has not been outside for many years and hates wheelchairs. Yet he sees this may be his best option to achieve his goal. He makes design alterations to his wheelchair which his family builds for him. He goes to court, the cameras are rolling ... His lawyers plead his case but the judges on a legal technicality, deny Ramon any time to speak. His request to die with dignity at a time of his choosing becomes the top news on television, the radio and in the newspapers ... A Catholic priest who is also paralyzed and in a wheelchair presents the case for life and surmizes before the cameras that perhaps Ramon has not received enough love from his family and is looking for this ... Manuela, his sister-in-law who has cared for Ramon during most of his paralysis is offended and hurt by the priest's allegations. She gets a chance to confront him, when the priest makes a visit to discuss Ramon's decision with him personally ... Ramon is confronted by his brother who adamantly states, that as head of the family, he will not allow anyone to kill himself in his house. The emotional toll of his decision on the family is shown fully and with sensitivity. It happens that at the end Ramon chooses to leave his home with one of his women friends to visit a seaside resort. This is where his final days are spent.<br /><br />The point of the film was to present life as it is lived from the POV of Ramon a paraplegic who is totally dependent on others. The whole idea was that in a mainly Catholic society (Spain) there was ONE person who stood *against* the majority (who believed it is a sin to commit suicide). He was trapped in a paraplegic body and wanted OUT. His family showed they loved/cared/sacrificed for him, no matter how it affected themselves and how it strained their relationships. At times, they were at emotional breaking points. The film was so outstanding I can not say enough about it. I had tears in my eyes often throughout the film. My highest recommendations. Be prepared to use up several boxes of tissues ...<br />Erika Borsos (pepper flower)lves and how it strained their relationships. At times, they were at emotional breaking points.

0618680004|5.0|God exists because human beings exist. He/She/It is a figment of our imagination.<br /><br />Thanks to this book, I will no longer have to spend hours arguing with the sheep that bleat all around me. I can simply give them a copy of this book--it eloquently says everything I can possibly say.. and then some.<br /><br />I congratulate the author for my most entertaining read of the year and for championing his worthy cause. I burst out laughing several times while reading it. Highly recommended!<br /><br />I also had a lot of fun reading some of the negative reviews of this book here. They all attack the author (ad hominem) without offering a single counter-argument to any of the book's content. How typical!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first season of Supernatural is great!  Each episode \\"rolls\\" right into the next, which keeps the plots moving along.  There could not have been any better actors used than Jensen and Jared cast as brothers. You really believe they are brothers!  This is a show like no other.
0316172324|5.0|The book arrived so quickly and in such a good condition that I didn't even notice it came from an Amazon Marketplace vendor. Great service!
B000HIVO64|3.0|its all in all a diffrent sounding album,<br /><br /> but within its  citizen Band radio-like elasticness, a classic,( dare i say Primitive ) pop sound resinates.<br /><br /> it reminds me of older 70's 8mm music soundtrack .along with the dvd, great album.<br /><br />the dvd has videos for every song (diffrent versions than the video you might see on TV for these songs)<br /><br />so to me,. its like grannys acid trip wrapped in a strawberry crepe with a pinch of zappa, all over again,  tottaly surprising.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|If you are familiar with the Pixies catchy, diverse, crazy-rock sound then you would most likely agree that every album they ever put out was exceptional and a worthy addition to your music collection. There are just too many good songs by these guys to even attempt making a best of collection. Songs not included like 'Motorway to Roswell', 'Is She Weird', and 'Subbacultcha' are some of the best songs they wrote - without these songs and many others, you cannot have a complete collection of the Pixies best.<br /><br />The 5 star rating is for the music that is on this album, not the album itself. If you insist on buying this best of album then you will only realize how great this band is and end up buying their whole collection anyhow.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you are not familiar with the Pixies it would be better to start by buying either 'Bossanova' (my personal favorite), 'Trompe Le Monde' (my next favorite), or 'Doolittle' (their most popular).
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Amy Lee comes into her own.  Loved the first CD.  Really loved this one.  Definitely her imprint and she comes through.  Don't want to forget about the rest of the band.  It's all solid.  Anyone who is, in any way, a fan will want this one.  Just a great band.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Great movie based on a Stephen King story.
B000002KHB|5.0|Seriously, 3 of the 7 songs on this album are classic hard rock anthems! Smoke On The Water, Highway Star, and Space Truckin'! Nuff said!!!! Deep Purple pretty much invented heavy metal. It was either them or Ozzy.
0307277887|3.0|While this book possesses a wonderfully exhilarating fast-paced plot--I gulped it down in one sitting, blithely ignoring house guests and personal responsibilities; and while its central conceit is pretty irresistible to the darker-minded among us--Dexter is a serial killer, but he only kills *bad* people--I found the ending frustratingly abrupt. Lindsay chooses a coy bit of bait-and-switch between the end of the penultimate chapter and the far-too-short concluding one rather than resolving the plot as it deserves to be resolved. I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I actually like the Showtime series based on the novel much more--it goes deeper into Dexter's psychology (the core of what makes this concept interesting), but also gives time to the supporting characters, most of whom are but vague, hazy outlines of people in the book. (Admittedly, since the book is written in the first person from Dexter's POV, deep psychological insights into the peripheral characters would be tough to justify, especially since Dexter, of all people, is unlikely to care.) <br /> <br />I haven't read the sequel, \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter,\\" yet, but hopefully it'll tie up some of the loose ends that \\"Darkly Dreaming\\" leaves cheerfully waving in the hot Miami breeze. Or at least tide me over until season two of Showtime's adaptation starts up.
0316172324|5.0|This is a really important book.  In fact, I found it more valuable than The Tipping Point, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.   There are numerous powerful insights, but the key insight for me--Look for the essential thing and do not let additional information about a subject cloud your vision.  I did not understand how distracting too much information can be.  I recommend the book and the insight in all my leadership seminars.
0671027344|4.0|Charlie is a fantastic character and you'll love him for his vulnerability.  <br /> <br />The book did feel like a teen journal written by an adult,  however. Charlie came across as ultra-innocent and a little too much of an altruistic victim. <br /> <br />However, the writing is good. The people are interesting. It's an honest read--satiates that small voyeuristic desire you know you have. Those are all reasons to read the book.  <br /> <br />This is the kind of book I'd pass along to friends.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We were told that the second season had a very slow start. While this may have been true for those watching as it aired and waiting a week between episodes, it isn't a problem with this DVD because you can feed your addiction like we did - watch 4 or 5 episodes in each sitting! Trust us - you'll have trouble tearing yourself away even then. The characters we've loved, hated and drooled over are joined by a few new faces as the series builds again through flashback and suspense to a fantastic cliffhanging conclusion. Bring on Season 3!!
B000GPIPTW|5.0|The Beach Boys experimented with this new form of Psychcedelic sound on thier two 1965 lps (The Beach Boys \\"Today\\" and \\"Summer Days and Summer Nights\\". With these two 1965 lps Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had ever created. In December 1965 after Brian Wilson had just heard the Beatles \\"Rubbersoul\\", a statement album from the fab four, implying that the whole album should be counted as the hit, not just a single or two off the album and the rest just filler. Brian was amazed at the simularities between the just released \\"Rubbersoul\\" and The Beach Boys earlier 1965 releases \\"Today\\" and \\"Summer Days and Summer nights\\". Brian would say \\"I want to make a record just like that, but I want to make it better!\\"    Brians competitive fires were stoked to compete with the Beatles. And what Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys created blew the Beatles right out of the water and rest was history. In fact the Beach Boys were so worried about Pet Sounds being accepted by Capital records they were prepared  to be told to \\"go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like Pet Sounds\\". Capital Records were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound. An incredible early psychedelic recording released May 16,1966 which influenced the Beatles 1967 Sgt.Pepper so much that George Martin has stated \\"if it were'nt for Pet Sounds Sgt. Pepper would not have been created\\". Pretty strong words from Sir George who helped produce the worlds greatest rock bands music. Believe me when the Beatles heard Pet Sounds their jaws dropped with envy and anger.    1966 was a very musically transitional year for both the Beatles and the Beach Boys. At this time on Aug.5th 1966 the Beatles released their counter shot to Pet Sounds with their masterpiece \\"Revolver\\". Many rockologists and Beatle fans alike consider Revolver to be a better recording than Sgt.Pepper, of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation. The Beach Boys were to add an exclamation point to Pet Sounds in october 1966 as the Beach Boys unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece \\"Good Vibrations\\" just a few months before the Beatles started their Sgt. Pepper recording sessions.    The Beatles were enjoying success with Revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with Revolvers release. Even with the success of Revolver, the release of Good Vibrations defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of 1966 than Revolver did and really got the Beatles crazy with envy, and created a real urgency for the Beatles to get back to Abbey Road studios to outdue their well armed  rivals. The Beach Boys never approached the success of the Beatles due partly if not all to Brian Wilsons bad habits of over indulgance, but Pet Sounds  really made the psychedelic  era sound and influenced the Beatles Sgt Pepper. As the song says God only knows what the Beach boys could have done post Pet Sounds, if it were'nt for Brians over indulgance in bad habits, will never know. Pet sounds was recorded while Brian had these bad habits but that is what helped Pet Sounds sound unique, Brian let these bad habits get the better of him post Pet Sounds.     Pet Sounds was not a commercial success when released, but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer Leonard Bernstien, as their minds were just blown away by it. I listen to both Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds  and there is some really eerie simularities, besides the instrumentation between the two, on Pet Sounds after \\"Caroline No\\" the last song on the recording you hear a trolly and a dog barking and than a train with its horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train passes. On Sgt. Pepper you hear barn animals, possibly Pet Sounds influenced and on Magical Mystery Tour you hear a train with its horn just before going into Pennylane. Pink Floyd would use animalssounds in their 1970s work, 1970 \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" including a cow on the cover of the lp. Pink Floyd in 1976 released an album called Animals and even used giant inflatable pigs on their Animals tour stage show, I wonder if Pet Sounds had anything to due with that?    Pet sounds caused the Beatles to disappear into Abbey Road for 6-8 months to make Sgt. Pepper. To make Sgt. Pepper better than Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. Because of this Sgt. Pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past, present and future. The Beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side Sir George Martin.     John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin vs. Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was on his own and had no real help, even though the remaining Beach Boys had some creative, musical skills. The one thing I will give the Beach Boys over the Beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the Beatles at Abbey Road. I respect the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson (Tony Asher) as a song writer and music creator. In my opinion the Beach Boys Pet Sounds set up the pschycodelic era, a really important era in rock history that even the Beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied Pet Sounds in some form. I like having both versions of Pet Sounds, Mono so you could hear how it sounded in 1966 and stereo because you could hear different instruments that you cant hear in mono.     I like the stereo version better because I am just used to stereo recordings, but I still like to listen to the mono version and go back to 1966. The 5.1 stereo sound is  mind boggeling and must be heard on your theatre system, you will not beleive Pet Sounds could sound this incredible. Every song on Pet Sounds is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history. Pet Sounds started the most Important era in rock history the Psychedelic Era. I recommend Pet Sounds to any music lover this recording truly set the standard as definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recordings ever created.     This cd mono and stereo sounds pristine and brilliantly remastered. The miniature booklet supplied with this 40th anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the dvd is an incredible look into this historical facinating recording. Pet Sounds is a very influential and timeless recording.     Pet Sounds is the blueprint for the entire psychodelic 1960s, early 1970s, which the Beatles and many rock groups of the time used the Pet Sounds blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time. If you the reader wish to get more into Pet Sounds you should look into purchasing [[ASIN:B000002U4U The Pet Sounds Sessions]]. You will with this four cd box set see how genius Brian Wilson constructs his 1966 masterpiece. If Pet sounds Sessions is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release.............................
B000HIVO64|5.0|I, like many others, have been very critical on Beck's work. He is an extremely prolific musician and causes vast disappointment when he releases mediocre work (ie. Guero). Upon purchasing Guero I didn't know what happened... did he suddenly loose all his finely tuned taste? Could disappointed fans ever trust this man again? Well, The Information has answered that with a resounding Yes. Every track on here is danceable (perhaps excluding \\"Movie Theme\\" and parts of the last 3 part track) at least and spine-tinglingly funky at best. The production is amazing (thanks to the dependable Nigel Goodrich) with sound that is thought provoking and, obviously, dance-party provoking while being extremely rich and intellectual (as it's full of tricky metaphors and equally beautiful and disturbing imagery). There are moments of slight boredom on the CD, particularly \\"No Complaints\\" and \\"Think I'm In Love\\", with a very radio-friendly aftertaste but the heroes of the album: \\"Dark Star\\", \\"Soldier Jane\\", \\"Cell phone's Dead\\", \\"1000 BPM\\" and \\"Motorcade\\" outnumber these. I will not say that this album is the best of Beck's catalogue but I will conclude that it is simply well written, forward thinking (as we've come to expect) and extremely necessary in a world full of infuriatingly monotonous sound blasting from every radio.
B00005JP9V|5.0|I thought this film looked interesting from the trailers, and it was something to behold when I saw it today. Even the critics can't praise this movie enough.<br /><br />The film is very bleak and actually quite violent at times. Clive Owen and Michael Caine are both fantastic here, as are the many weird characters we meet along the way. The 10 minute action scene towards the end is like something out of Saving Private Ryan, and it is all shot in one take. There is no editing during the action scene as the camera follows Clive Owen around. How did they coordinate all the explosions and extras without saying cut? Freaking amazing! I still can't wait until the highly reviewed Pan's Labyrinth comes to my town, but for now Children of Men reigns supreme.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|As an avid Jane Austen fan, I absolutely loved this movie.  For those who are Jane purists, this is not a movie for you.  But if you are the sort of person who doesn't mind a bit of license being taken with the actual text, then you might find this movie pleases very nicely. A keeper.
0060899190|4.0|Loved this book!  It was a fun read.  The only drawback is the language.  I can live with it, but don't want my kids to be reading it.  I sent it on to a friend when finished reading
B000FWHVKA|5.0|What drew me to this album was a comment in a music magazine that I read that discovered the music on it as gothic/electronic/dark/scary. \\"Silent Shout\\" by The Knife is my absolute fav of 2006 I can't go a day without listening to it. My first favorite song and I believe will always be my preferred listen is Track #6 \\"Marble House.\\" The music and lyrics are both haunting and addicting to listen to take after take. The sound of two marble balls I believe in the beginning crashing into another and just the lyrics will have you wishing you wrote this song. \\"I cut your nails and comb your hair. I carry you down the stairs. I wanted to see right through from the other side.\\" And the amazing chorus that follows \\"The moment we believe that we have never met. Another kind of love it's easy to forget. When we are all alone then we do both agree. We have a thing in common this was meant to be.\\" Track #7 \\"Like A Pen\\" that follows is just as addicting to listen to as \\"Marble House\\" I know that the beginning part of these two songs has what seems like a little over a minute of music before the lyrics kick in but that is b/c Olof Dreijer is such an outstanding musician who regularly listens to instrumental music. I am a huge electronic music fan so I could listen to the way any of the bands I like play the keyboards/synthesizers/drum machines/low bass/etc. Not only the music will draw anyone in but Karin Dreijer-Anderssen's lyrics are out of this world. Track #2 \\"Neverland\\" \\"I'm singing for money it burns my hands.\\" Even Track #7 \\"Like A Pen\\" contends \\"you're now my only friend I'm too heavy I'm a burden.\\" Even Track #1 \\"Silent Shout\\" is so dark sounding and well executed. I will admit at first it took me some time to get use to the voices on some of the tracks either sounding high-pitch or deep moaning. Besides that mention this album receives my highest regards b/c it was released by a record label financed by the brother/sister duo themselves giving them the freedom to make the music they want without any boundaries. I can honestly say I cannot compare The Knife to any other artist out today, the music is so original and groundbreaking that it gives people hope that more artists are and will do that same.
1592401791|5.0|Don't think of this as a book about the Beatles. Think of H,T&E as \\"How To Win Friends And Influence People\\" traveling under a different name. Emerick might have set out to present his take on the Beatles, but without intending to wrote a valuable primer extolling the virtues of practicing tactful behavior. Read this if you'd like to make your career path a smoother one.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|A perfect album that was written way before my time, but still is absolutely relevant in every way today.   Politics, Race, War, Employment, Depression, every topic is hear and clear.
B00005JKES|5.0|I bought this set when it first came out in 2001 and have only watched it through once.I hadn't seen the series before,so then I went to a video store and rented season two.Needless to say the entire series is amazing and changed tv for better!Now that season two will be in my hands a little over four monthas from now,I will be able to see a clean,crisp version of the whole thing(minus the pilot episode;what's with that?)I reccomend these sets to Lynch fans,artistic film stundents,and anyone who has an open-mindedness about them.
B000A0GXGA|4.0|THE  QUALITY WAS GOOD AND THE STORIES WERE ALSO GOOD. I AM ON THE LIST WHEN THE FIRST SEASON COMES OUT. THIS IS LIKE A TEASE.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|A page-turner and such a sweet story. Everybody I know loved this book. It's about horrible things but her writing is so terrific it becomes beautiful.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I thought this was another group of Beatles' songs under a new name. I do not care if it is a re-mix or taken from the original recordings and \\"cleaned up\\" as McCartney says, it is cool. I thought it was worth the money.
B000001ED1|4.0|I especially liked the song One of Us and I discovered others that I like just as well.  The songs seemed to stick my memory after I listen to the CD.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were too high but it was not nearly as funny as I was expecting it to be.  At first the story was funny but then it was like an old joke that keeps getting repeated until it is too worn out to be funny any longer.  A good idea, perhaps, but not quite as good as I had expected or as good as it might have been.  Still, it was good for a mild chuckle from time to time.
B000002QWD|5.0|I think that perhaps everyone's favorite Christmas song is White Christmas sung by Bing Crosby... well, it's mine too. This is the absolute best Christmas cd ever! You just can't go wrong with this man... he's amazing!
B00005JP9V|1.0|I looked forward to this film when I heard the premise; a near future in which people could no longer have children.  Hollywood rarely puts out \\"big ideas\\". They ended up being true to form on this one also.  You will miss nothing if you miss this.    Basically, a pregnant African immigrant is chased through incidental urban warfare in Britain by an anti-anti-immigration terrorist group who wants to use her pregnancy to gain status.  The larger world and government was not aware of the situation.      The action wasn't that exciting; just random and violent urban warfare. Sporadic \\"shock\\" action in between long stretches of .. not much.  I considered leaving out of boredom through most of the last 2/3rds, but kept expecting it all to eventually lead somewhere.    Sometimes, the act of lighting a cigarrette would be portentously stretched out over lengthy spans, leading you to think the scene was headed somewhere.  But it wasn't.  The guy was just lighting a cigarrette.  Same with pulling out a bottle of booze.  I guess this is a \\"post-modern\\" film; meaninglessness is meaningful.  So brilliant. ( <- sarcasm, by the way).    Aside from the beginning, when world-wide mourning over the death of the world's youngest person was depicted, the infertile-world concept played essentially no part in the film. The opportunities to convincingly  imagine and explore the consequences were ignored.    Instead, the focus shifted to an incoherent grab-bag of left-wing socio-political dreams and a VERY narrow focus on a rotating handful of characters that could never be fully developed before they were killed in the urban gun battles.      These are the messages the movie tries to convey::       * Opposing illegal immigration is very bad according to the movie. Most of the film revolved around well-equipped police (buff white-guys) brutalizing helpless \\"immigrants\\" warehoused in cages or slums. Why the problem required that solution was never explained (because it's just left-wing political fantasy ... what else do police do but brutalize helpless and unarmed people for no reason?)       * You can always count on the moral fiber of hippies. The brightest beacon of civilization and morality amidst the chaos, in their woodsy-hideaway, listening to the Beatles (or whatever that rancid-60's music was) and charmingly growing their \\"weed\\".       * If people had no future, apparently they would turn off the scrubbers in smokestacks, let toxic waste pour into the rivers, and leave dead pigs and horses by the side of the road  (because it's just left-wing political fantasy ... what else do people do except destroy the environment?).        * Religion is absent in this movie, except for a group clearly depicted as quacks in funny clothes; that which shouldn't be taken seriously by \\"intelligent\\" people.  There was an attempt to parallel with Christ, even involving a \\"crazy\\" Mary Magdalene type figure, but it only shows the film-makers don't really understand what that was about either.     Of course, when calamities have been faced historically (The Plague in middle ages, WW II Blitz on London, concentration camps, etc.) people's actual response has been the opposite of what the film depicts, informed by Christian understanding of reality,  and the subsequent desire to preserve normalcy.     But because the movie is a left-wing political fantasy, such impulses are not understood or recognized, because they aren't part of the Left's bleak understanding of themselves (chemical accidents of evolution) and the world (irrational and without future because it doesn't conform to leftist political assumptions that people are chemical accidents with no purpose).    This \\"art-house theater only\\" movie will strongly resonate in Europe. With Europe's rapidly shrinking white population, influx of immigrants, and uni-mind lock on a particular set of political assumptions, this movie is essentially an amplification of what the secular European intellectual, with rose-tinted lenses, sees as being ALMOST reality right now.     This is why the central premise of an infertile-world receded into the background of the movie so quickly; it was superfluous.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I don't think that anyone could ever dispute the fact that Audrey Hepburn is regal... nothing short of royalty. This movie is one of my favorite Hepburn films. She's divine. And her princess dress is any little girl's dream! I don't like Gregory Peck usually, (except, of course, in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', but that could be because he was simply made to be Atticus.), but he doesn't bother me in the slightest in this movie. One of my all-time favorite movies.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Sorry everybody, I have to post this under the DVD section because there IS NO LISTNG for U-571 under Popular Music. I know that there are lots of people who have been interested in the original score to U-571 but can't seem to find it....well, that's true considering the score was never actually released. Richard Marvin is one of Hollywood's lesser-known composers but that does not make him a poor composer by any means. In fact, his work for U-571 is regarded as an excellent contribution to the submarine genre. Most submarine flicks since the 1980's have had very memorable scores (Das Boot, The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide) and Richard's own music is a welcome addition to the submarine legacy. As I mentioned earlier, it is sad that Varese Sarabande or another music producer did not release the score on CD.....but wait! Universal Songs Inc. did a promotional release of the score in 2000 just for the composer. These extremely limited edition CD's were quickly sold out and finding a copy is as easy as finding a copy of Alan Silvestri's \\"Predator\\"! I am one of the lucky few who was able to track down a copy of this promotional release of U-571. Is it a great soundtrack? You bet! If you are interested in trying to find a copy yourself, here is what you'll get on the CD: <br /> <br />1. End Credits #1 (2:16) <br />2. Sub Battle (5:46) <br />3. Material Office (1:14) <br />4. Chase (2:54) <br />5. Finale and Dedication (4:41) <br />6. Picking up Survivors (2:41) <br />7. S-33 Leaves Port (1:43) <br />8. Big Leaks (1:46) <br />9. Restarting the U-571 (1:07) <br />10. Going to 200 Meters (1:05) <br />11. Destroyer Battle (8:36) <br />12. Enigma Photo/Swastika (2:09) <br />13. Pier Intro (0:55) <br />14. Lock and Load (2:17) <br />15. Taking the U-571 (1:44) <br />16. Tyler Picks Trigger (1:15) <br />17. U-571 Rises/Trigger Struggles (2:34) <br />18. S-33 Sinks (2:22) <br />19. Searching Below (2:14) <br />20.

6302794331|5.0|As I reread A Christmas Carol this December, I couldn't help but thinking just about the entire time that I wished I was watching the Muppet Christmas Carol. The music is, of course, wonderful, and Michael Caine is so good as Scrooge. Christmas just doesn't seem like Christmas until I've watched this movie a few times.
630526323X|5.0|the only thing that rivals this is Coppola's Dracula, but Herzogs is so much more morbid and haunting!  Gorgeous photography, and Kinski is insane!  Max would be honored by this performance.  If you want to see a horrifying Dracula, watch this one.  This is one of my favorite movies.
0807014265|5.0|Book was brand new as stated, and arrived in five days.  That's about as good as it gets.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|A strong three stars. Because it kept me interested. Mr. Washington is slightly more cocky as the lead detective than necessary. I suspect because the role was less demanding than awkward for him, or perhaps I've got that backward. And I really can't say what Ms. Foster was doing as her role was limited, however, played to the hilt - sort of like an operatic voice singing blues. Clive Owen really brings it off. And Christopher Plummer - did these greats owe something to someone. But, more than anything - it's the story, and what Mr. Lee didn't do to it. Fast paced, well thought out, the inevitable twist, and an excellent ending.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|I have been a Beatle's fan since 1964. i saw them in concert in 1966. I own every Beatles album in existance as well as the matching CD for today's digital world. In my opinion they are the best that has ever been or will be. <br /> <br />I received the \\"Love\\" CD for Christmas and have been looking for a discreet garbage can to deposit it into ever since. This is by far the WORST Beatle's collection I have ever owned and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I generally like reggae, and generally don't much like rap/hip-hop, but this album is terrific on so many levels that it doesn't matter.  It's amazing that the Marley talent lives on in so many of The Great Man's offspring.  Rasta-far-eye-yi-yi!!!
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|The screen play pales in comparison with the book, A&E's version, the BBC's version and any other version I've seen.  The casting is also largely inferior -- particularly when it comes to Mr. Bennet and D'Arcy.  There is just no chemistry here.  Save your money and buy the A&E version!
B000FIMG68|5.0|The 2nd Season of LOST gave viewers some answers to a few of the plotline's mysteries such as what is in the hatch, but not enough of the mysteries are answered to where anticipation for season three is lessened.   <br /> <br />The developing of each of the characters stranded on the island continues to be outstanding while new characters from the tail section of the airplane stranded on the opposite side of the island are added to the mix of character development as well.  The new characters are only mildly interesting with the character of LA policewoman, Ann Lucia being down right annoying after a while. However, the Nigerian character of Echo by the end of the season becomes one of the most interesting characters in the whole show.   <br /> <br />The extras on the DVD aren't enough to warrant buying the DVD package if you have already seen the series, but if you are like me and due to work you can't sit down every week to watch the LOST season the DVD package is absolutely best way to go. <br /> <br />Bring on Season Three, I can't wait!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you are a fan of the Beatles \\"Love\\" is a true keeper.  Original Beatle producer George Martin and his son Giles did a great job doing what would almost seem the ultimate sacrilege for Beatles fans...they remixed and reworked a many of the songs.  <br /> <br />For the most part the results are wonderful.  For the first time in decades these songs sound exciting and fresh.  Highlights here include, \\"Drive My Car\\", the climax of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" ..well, almost all of them.  \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" has never sounded as full and rich as it does here.  I would say this collection is perfect except for one track.  \\"Gnik Nus\\" or \\"Sun King\\" done backward, was a mistkake.  But it's less than a minute of a seventy plus minute CD.   <br /> <br />If you think this is just another greatest hits package you're wrong.  This is much, much more.  Any fan of the Beatles who dismisses this release is seriously short changing themselves.
B000G75AE8|5.0|This record will kick your a** from start to finish. Once again Slayer is doing what they were born to do. As one of the founders of the genre, Slayer has managed to once again crank out an album of unparalleled technical proficiency, and consistency. As mentioned before, the album is not reinventive, but they have definately managed to progress within the boundaries of their signature sound. To compare this album with their earlier classics would miss the point. It is awesome in and of itself regardless of how familiar you may be with their work. While I was a bit dissapointed with the somewhat meandering direcction of the previous album, my senses were pleasantly renewed with this latest offering. Hearing Lombardo back on the drums is pure alchemy, and he continues here to solidify himself as one of the best in his class. Plenty of blistering solos from Kerry and Hanneman, and Tom Araya's truly unique voice is holding out nicely as it rounds out the overall sound. Don't waste anymore time reading reviews, just get this CD ASAP. You'll be glad you did.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|That is my first headphone. But I do not think that is the reason I truly loved this piece. It is amazing. Once you wear it, the same songs you just listened to before are now injected to your ears and it does not go to your brain only through your nerves, but it also mixes to your blood and your each and every organ feels it. Then you can not help yourself and in the middle of the office forget what you are doing and start screaming and jumping.<br /><br />Fortunately, when I did that, it was a Friday night at 21:35. So nobody was around. I guess this is the only con, I can make up.<br /><br />Just tape your mouth and chain yourself to make sure you do not disturb other people when you are enjoying the outstanding quality; I mean those who do not own MDR-7506.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The tone was better, and the creatures were scary looking. I love this movie. Buy 'Aliens' while you can and go see it.<br /><br />This time it's war.
0800141660|4.0|Jane Austen was a keen observer of the world in which she lived, and Emma Thompson seems to be a perfect choice for adapting Austen's work to the screen. Even the best film projects have problems from the beginning, be <br />it insufficient budget, a less-than-perfect script or poor casting. <br />SENSE AND SENSIBILITY sidesteps all these pitfalls and emerges as arguably <br />the best adaptation of any Jane Austen novel. <br /> <br />The production values are sterling, and the performances could not be better.  Those seeking a fast-paced adventure film may look elsewhere. <br />However, if sensitivity, fine acting, romance and superb photography <br />interest you, look no further!  You have found it all.
B000EMGAGW|1.0|I am a Mobb Deep fan since Juvenile Hell, but they been G-Euniched.  In Blood Money, the first mistake was having their executive producer being \\"50 Cents\\" instead of themselves or at least the Alchemist, which was the joint producer of Eminem's Re-Up CD.  From beginning to the end, you hear \\"G-Unit\\" instead of \\"The Infamous\\" which shown them being completely sold out from their own foundation.  Of their songs on the CD, the best beat goes to \\"Pearly Gates\\".   Interesting enough, the CD has the edited version of the song because Prodigy says alot of offensive things about Jesus Christ in the original version.  Other decent songs are songs that been on other CDs.  But this is a G-Unit CD and if you love G-Unit, then you would love this one.  But being a Mobb Deep fan, they completely lost their identity.
B000HT3Q14|3.0|While the movie certainly stands on its own, the improvements over the standard DVD are not nearly as great as other HD transfers.<br /><br />The entire movie has a soft and under saturated and at times grainy look to it that makes it tough to distinguish it from a good standard DVD setup. While I am sure there are improvements in overall detail, it just does not have the same step up in quality that you may be looking for. Of course that may be to much to expect from an older movie but one can always dream.<br /><br />Despite my lack of enthusiasm for the HD transfer, its still a great movie and certainly warrants being in any fans collection. Just don't expect it to make the older DVDs seem obsolete.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Sandra and Keanu are so wonderful in this movie, alone and together.  They are two of my favorite actors.  This is a touching and heart-tugging romance with a twist - they live two years apart in a sort-of parallel universe.  Don't try to figure that out and just enjoy the movie.  If you try to analyze it, some things don't make sense and seem \\"wrong\\" but it's a movie, so just go with the flow, get some tissues and settle in.  Watch it again and again and you will have some \\"aha\\" and \\"Oh, yeah\\" moments as you discover things you missed the first time around.<br /><br />The couple communicate, and fall in love, through letters they leave for each other at the Lake House.  Will they ever get to meet?  Will this romance have a happy ending?  Watch it and see - I hope you love it as much as I did.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Green Day is the best and most talented \\"band\\" since the Fab Four...this is the opinon of someone who was a teenager when Little Richard kicked the doors down.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I became a John Mayer fan when I heard \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" on the radio about 5 years ago.  \\"Room For Squares\\" and \\"Heavier Things\\" remain two of my favorite CDs. I immediately bought \\"Continuum\\" upon its release.  John Mayer's music and lyrics have a mature, blues-y sound on this CD and, in my opinion, is his best CD so far.  He is so deserving of his Grammy nomination and, hopefully, a win is in the stars for him.  I bought this CD three months ago and it is still the most played from my CD collection.  I know all the John Mayer fans already own this CD so this review is for those who are perhaps not that familiar with John's work and are wondering if it is worth buying.  You will not be disappointed - this is a GREAT CD with excellent vocals, lyrics and music and one you will not soon tire of.  Every song is a gift for your ears and soul.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal DVD library! This movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie. Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years. The message is clear, \\"People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people!\\"<br /><br />Dr. Matthew J. Loop<br /><br />- Author of \\"Cracking the Cancer Code\\"
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Love this DVD and the little jacket cover is cool. One of my favorite movies, and my kids even like to watch and sing along with the songs.
087349976X|4.0|This is an awsome book.  I saw it in the craft store.  I flipped through it and was utterly delighted with the projects.  There are several ideas with which to get your imagination going. <br /> <br />I don't like it when there is no discussion of what is IN the book so here is a brief synop: <br />It opens wiwth the typical discussion of basic supplies and wire working techniques (wire loops,spirals, a basic eyelet chain).  Then it moves into earrings, coils, and wire braiding and wrapping for both half round and round wire (which I never realized there was a different technique for each).  Next the author goes into basic instruction of bead weaving, etc.  Finally there are the projects in order of increasing difficulty. <br /> <br />The negative of the book is that the steps are not completely illustrated.  So, if you were not familiar with the basics you could be a bit lost.  The projects, themselves, are color photos while the instrucions are only illustrated.   <br /> <br />I did not give the book 5 stars simply because I have not made a piece yet to put to the test the ease of following the instructions.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Often called the greatest cult film of all time, \\"Eraserhead\\" is unlikely to blow you away if you're: 1. seeing it on a small screen; 2. viewing one of the 2nd-rate Asian DVD copies widely available on the internet; 3. already familiar with \\"Elephant Man\\" and/or \\"Blue Velvet,\\" both of which combine all of the visual, aural, and thematic elements of \\"Eraserhead\\" with topnotch production values.<br /><br />As for \\"Eraserhead,\\" think of it as a combination of Kafka's \\"Metamorphoses\\" and T. S. Eliot's \\"The Wasteland\\" told in the cinematic style of Bunuel/Dali's \\"Un Chien Andalou.\\" The area in which Lynch strikes me as inarguably inventive if not innovative is in the use of the soundtrack to convey narrative and emotional meaning. Not since Orson Welles (who parlayed his radio creativity into movie fame) has a filmmaker found more ways for representing the sonic dimensions of human experience. Whereas Welles used reverberation in conjunction with deep focus to convey the sense of space separating human beings, Lynch employs much \\"white noise\\" to take us into an \\"inner space\\" of expectation, anxiety, and dread. Put another way, he's a master at recording the \\"silence\\" that, as Robert Frost puts it in \\"Desert Places,\\" scares us all.<br /><br />Besides the emptiness of his spiritless surroundings, Henry (the protagonist) clearly suffers from acute anxieties towards women--they entice, seduce, threaten, trap and abandon, alternately motivate and disintegrate any sense of \\"self,\\" their biology constantly returning him to a natural \\"muck\\" that is hardly a satisfying alternative to the denatured and depressing industrial world.<br /><br />I'm left pondering the meaning of the title. Henry's high hairdo could be described as an eraser, though it looks more like a broom or brush hiding the pinhead-sized structure beneath it. When Henry loses his head (quite literally) and a boy brings it to a pencil factory, we get our fullest glimpse of what Lynch might have in mind. The \\"natural\\" wood of the pencils is parodied by their assembly-line production. When the machine operator occasionally tests one of the pencils by scribbling something and then immediately erasing it, we sense the illusory quality of human thought and the notion of a coherent and continuous \\"self.\\" In that respect, human identity along with what I've just written and the film itself are all extremely tenuous and erasable--an ending that might be viewed as the antithesis to that of \\"The Elephant Man\\" (\\"Nothing can ever die. Nothing\\").e \\"natural\\" wood of the pencils is parodied by their assembly-line production.

Yes, it's a polished piece, perhaps overproduced; they have the bucks, the studio and the talent - who can blame them for making the cuts the way THEY wanted?   <br /> <br />You and I certainly can't do it and that's why I'm gratfeful BB and EC did do it.  It's a shame it's over so quick however.  <br /> <br />\\"Worried Life Blues' worth the price of admission alone.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|While I still give the band highest marks, the ghastly rendition of Hotel California is unlistenable on this concert DVD.  Changing the song in the first place was a gamble (a trumpet plays Felder's opening, if you can believe that), but there is NO guitar blend to speak of, the replcement's guitar sounds like something from Walmart, and Henley's voice this late in the concert was showing wear...<br /><br />IMHO they placed the song this late in the concert - as opposed to Opening with it, as done forever - because they knew that Felder is sorely missed on that one song...  nore than anywhere else.<br /><br />I should say that I listened to the album through three copies, then a CD, and finally 'Hell Freezes Over' played about 200 times since its release on DVD and during 50 parties...  You could say I'm familiar with their work.  So as a warning to anyone else that loves this song for the perfection that it is... Hideous is the kindest term I can apply...  Bar bands have covered it better.<br /><br />The remainder of the DVD is very good, I just wish the engineer or Someone could have provided the guitar blend we're accustomed to...  they sound like they are each playing unaware that there are other guitars, and the replacement's guitar sound is just plain WEAK...<br /><br />3 stars, Hell Freezes Over is 5 stars.

B000001EUR|5.0|Let me preface by saying that I rate according to how satisfied I have been since discovering or re-discovering music that I buy, or, know enough to have a decent opinion from earlier experience with it.  If you think you MAY like a band or cd, gotten onto Amazon (which is primo) and listened to the samples for the cd, then you know pretty much what you're in for.  Reviews help alot, though.  But, reviewers who blast a cd or band for personal, almost political reasons don't help those of us debating to buy based on what we like to hear.  Just had to get that out to let you know I'm sincere when I say...  this cd is full of really great Scorpions songs.  Really great songs period.  Sure, many were played over and over on radio, but for good reason.  I love the Scorp's, and I appreciate \\"Big City Nights\\" as much as anyone, but I've heard it a million times.  It's the gems in between that seal the deal on this one.   \\"Coming Home\\" for instance.  Song samples do this one no justice because of how it cuts loose later.  \\"Same Thrill\\", \\"As Soon as the Good Times Roll\\", and the timeless anti-war \\"Crossfire\\" are really, really good.  I saw these guys 3 times back in the 80' in Chicago.  Fun, energetic, loud, powerful tunes; a great stage show every time.  The rest of their earlier stuff is exceptional as well.  This one, \\"Animal Magnetism\\", and \\"Lovedrive\\" are essential for those of us who like, or love, the Scorpions.
B000FIHJLK|5.0|This is a fantastic show. I've had unofficial copies of this show for years and they truly did a great job on the transfer. The bonus videos are a major plus too. This is Rainbow at their peak with Ronnie Dio and the late great Cozy Powell on drums. I still get chills when I hear the live version of Catch The Rainbow. It really shows how versatile Dio could be at times. Cozy tears it up and his drum solo is amazing to say the least. The only downside IMO is Blackmore breaking his guitar at the end of the show. He should've just left those types of antics to The Who. Buy it, it's well worth it!
B000006TRV|5.0|So many incredible pieces on this.  If you don't have this, you have to get it.  It's as good or better now than when they were (and still are) over-playing \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\".  How many epic albums match the story set out in this collection of songs?  How about none?  If there's a limit to the excellence a band can put into a production, Pink Floyd bursts through it with \\"The Wall\\".  Incredible guitar work and emotional lyrics; funny, sad, angry, insane, it's all here for your listening pleasure.  Just calling it one of the greatest albums of all time seems like an understatement.  You deserve music this good, so treat yourself while supporting a classic.

I do respect Gilmour's greatness, but I just didn't care for this cd.  I gave it a real shot, too, but it's too slow and introverted.

1401302378|5.0|Asked to rate the best business book of the past 5 years, I nominated The Long Tail with this message:<br /><br />This book (The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More) by Chris Anderson of Wired magazine is thoughtful, provocative, and well-written, which immediately puts it into special company where \\"business books\\" are concerned. But what makes it extremely important, and qualifies it as tge best business book in recent memory, is that it manages to shine a very helpful light on the future while also providing a well-researched analysis of why certain companies, and approaches, have been so successful in the recent (and in the case of the Sears catalogue, the not so recent) past.<br /><br />This is an important book for so many different kinds of business book readers: entrepreneurs, indie publishers, musicians, retailers, political organizers, authors, marketers, eBayers and Amazon sellers, and I could go on and on. I suspect it will continue to be refreshed, content-wise, for a considerable time in the future. Several years ago (under my pen name) I wrote a book about online bookselling, and Anderson's ideas are essential to what I was trying to say in that book about the importance, for an online bookseller, of finding uncommon books for one's inventory. Currently I am putting the finishing touches on a new book about the indie publishing movement (Beyond the Literary-Industrial Complex: Unleashing a 21st Century Movement of Readers, Writers, and Independent Publishers), and again, Anderson's ideas are central to my new book's preoccupations.<br /><br />I am sure there are many other worthy contenders, but Anderson's book, a bestseller in spite of its own anti-hit spirit, is my nominee.
B00005JOLI|1.0|Have you ever wondered what Star Wars would be like as a Fantasy movie? Go see Eragon. <br /> <br />We've got Eragon (Luke Skywalker) who lives with his uncle (Uncle Owen). His friend  Roran (Biggs) leaves to go on an adventure and Luke, I mean Eragon, is left all alone on the farm on Tatooine, I mean, random farm village. There's even a scene where he watches forlornly as the sun sets, though, unlike Tatooine, there's only one sun. Now Eragon finds a dragon egg and learns the way of the force, I mean magic, from Brom (Obi Wan) who happens to live in the same village. Together they set off and have to save the princess (Leia) from being killed by the evil King's (Palpatine) right hand man, Darth Va - I mean Durza. Now they have to find the Rebel Base and protect it from the Death Star before it's too late! Well, they do go to the Rebel Base but instead of the Death Star we have the forces of Mordor attacking. Good thing Luke and Leia are there to save the day! <br /> <br />Besides the severely unoriginal storyline serving huge helpings of both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, the movie is just awful. There is no sense of distance or time - characters seem to travel across the continent in a matter of minutes or hours. We have no idea how many days pass (if any) and from the looks of things the entire evil army is able to march to the rebel stronghold in a day - the same for Jeremy Irons and his remarkable ability to show up halfway across the world in a few hours. How could this movie have passed screening tests? The good Varden people have waited 1000 years for Eragon and his Dragon who can't seem to hold three people even though a horse can hold two? How about the fact that Eragon just happens to know new spells at convenient times with no prior knowledge? How about the fact that we don't care about the Varden because they are just people in shiny outfits to the viewers? <br /> <br />The only good thing about this movie is seamless visual effects when Eragon ridesSaphira, and even that won't get me to purchase it on DVD. <br /> <br />Kevin's Review: D-
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|Fans should not fear the Wachowski brothers.  The Wachowski brothers should fear the fans.  <br /> <br />Considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read.  I am however, thoroughly disappointed.  They might as well have put Keanu Reeves in the role of V.   <br /> <br />The graphic novel is a thought-provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security.  It is many-layered, complex, and intelligent - little of this translates to the screen.  Entire characters and plotlines are rewritten or ignored in the film version, and important themes are lost entirely.   <br /> <br />As a standalone piece of work, it might suck less.  But for a fan of the graphic novel, the film adaptation is a poor reflection of a work of genius.  Do yourself and your brain a favor - read the book!!!!
0618680004|5.0|I am a recovering fundamental Christian, and this is really the first book I have read from a genuinely Atheistic point of view, though I have had plenty of exposure to articles in magazines and on the web. It has been a most revealing and pleasant experience to see Richard Dawkins views on God, and how he explains the reasoning behind an entirely naturalistic world view.<br /><br />His topics range from beliefs of famous scientists like Einstein to different theories of God to arguments for and against the existence of God. He discusses the origins of religion and morality and the reasons we do not obtain our morality from religion - one of the most convincing parts of the book in my opinion. Then he talks specifically about the faults of religion and debunks the claims of needs for it. A very helpful appendix has resources for atheists all over the world.<br /><br />The only weak point is the argument that he tries to prove there is no possibility of a god - or at least an extremely low probability - based on the premise that if such a complex thing exists, it must also have had an origin and evolved. That seems like a non sequitur, but I do not claim to be an expert philosopher. It still seems possible, but I am at least convinced that if there is a god, it is not accurately described by any religion on the face of the earth, being out of reach of human intellectual grasp, which I suppose would make me effectively an a-theist of the agnostic variety (though that is still to be worked out), since I cannot claim a belief in any specifically defined god. Or does that make me a deist?<br /><br />If anyone is a Christian and needs help getting over the hump of the Bible being the inspired word of God, I highly recommend Bart Ehrman's books. It may be surprising what you would find just to read works on textual criticism and canon by Bruce Metzger and F. F. Bruce, two unequivocally Christian scholars (in the truest sense) that are honest about the fallibility of the Bible.<br /><br />Five stars for Dawkins and this book - I plan to read many more of his books, starting with The Selfish Gene.

B000FIMG68|5.0|The real success of Lost is that it uses the odd island and its odd inhabitants to further the development of the show's characters. The second season even adds a handful of interesting characters from the doomed plane's tail section. The episodes are presented very well in anamorphic widescreen. The audio is clear, but the surround experience is lacking. But really, this is not a big deal. If you liked the box set of Lost Season 1, you'll find this set familiar and just as impressive.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Unfortunately many people's approach to this film is wrecked by: (1) its genesis between dueling directorial \\"giants\\" Kubrick and Speilberg; (2) its \\"science fiction\\" tag, as apparently a harbinger of some soon to appear \\"future.\\"  Buried under all this hype, confusion and pretense, many will never get into this admittedly  quite difficult film.  Perhaps, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein, it is \\"headed for the museums\\" -- thus not to be understood, paradoxically, until as far into the future as when the proverbial space aliens land, and nobody gives a rat's hind end who Kubrick or Spielberg were.  And most sadly for the younger, intelligent crowd that the film is aimed at, their own intelligence has been artificially reduced for three (count 'em, three) generations running of public \\"education\\" as indoctrination, with ALL literature presented as politics and/or polemic.<br /><br />So before even \\"suspending\\" your disbelief in preparation for AI's fiction, ALSO temporarily suspend some bad present day cultural assumptions: (1) warp drive; (2) inevitable progress; (3) ET is out there; (4) Kubrick and/or Speilberg is not only a talented film maker, but also an important \\"thinker\\" necessary for you to grapple with; (4) sentimentality is ALWAYS bad, rationalism ALWAYS good.  There are many more, but this will do.  And substitute this, which your teachers should have told you if they were anything other than prancing monkeys, despite presumed millennia of evolution to achieve their hack wisdom:  ALL human societies have suppressed truth,  NOT ONLY Hitler or Mussolini or Ghengis Khan or some other era from the bad old days, but EVEN us, and right now.  When this inevitably occurs, truth nonetheless bubbles up through folktale, word of mouth, comic strips, graffitti, whatever -- often not through the esteemed \\"great\\" artists or writers, but more often by some artless, at least unpretentious genre writer like Brian Aldiss.  Upon whose little story this great hairy mammoth known as A1 landed.<br /><br />I am not going to tell you what you should think about this film, not because I don't HAVE an opinion, either.  For one thing, its so deceptively simple that any plot analysis is a giveaway.

AI is a challenge, like a medieval knight throwing down a gauntlet.  Its no accident that your feelings will be involved but no, they are not yanked.  The sentiment here is not false, nor the ideas cheap.  The film is about what is going on in America today -- not about any imagined, probable, or likely future.  It uses the artifice of \\"science fiction\\" to confront us about who we are and the choices we are making.  Yeah it will enrage many too, simply because we are all conditioned to a certain degree of public suppression -- indeed, a degree of that is necessary to any society functioning above the level of anarchy.  But the question is what each of us, finally, can suppress, and what it is simply inhuman to suppress.  What bubbles up through such cultural concrete used to be called ALLEGORY: something standing for something else that is nonetheless quite potently real.

Hopefully, the younger generation will see through the us-versus-them mentality of those who think environmental issues are only for liberals. Be that as it may, this is a delightful, entertaining, seat-of-your-pants adventure that is simply a joy to experience. Even if you are not into message films, the humor and the songs will make you smile for days. I went home and downloaded the soundtrack right after seeing it. This film will rank alongside Finding Nemo in popularity and longevity. Like Nemo, it's one that you'll want to watch over and over. Wings up to this awesome happy movie!
B00000JLWW|2.0|There was a time in my youth when I, being innocent and inexperienced, succumbed to the pressures of watching this feigned romantic drama set against the backdrop of history. Even at the time I found the plot to be artificial and cliche, the acting dry, the character development terrible, and the special effects quite impressive (the only real reason to see the movie). While Leonardo DiCaprio has evolved into a spectacular actor (e.g., the Aviator, Catch Me if You Can, the Departed), this has to be by far the most trite, redundant and superficial role that I've ever seen him in as an actor. I would say the same for Kate Winslet (who proved her acting abilities in Eternal Sunshine). <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of special effects; I've always preferred strong plot lines and character developments. However, if you like those kind of blockbuster special effects then you might enjoy this film, and if you're a teenage girl you'll probably watch this film several times and do a Google image search for Leo. Compounded with the lackluster acting performances and subpar plot, the music for the film (esp. Celine Dion's big hit) is banal, sappy and devoid of substantive sentiment. <br /> <br />I would avoid this film at all costs. If you've never seen it then you've avoided one of the more recent cinematic blunders of pop culture. <br /> <br />

B0009MAP9A|5.0|This is one of the great albums from Dylan's first decade.  The title tune should be in any Hall of Fame for American music of the last half of the 20th century.<br /><br />\\"The Time They Are A-Changin'\\" is a song that speaks to the crosscutting debates of the 1960s.  It provides voice for one perspective.  But so, too, do other of the songs on this CD.  \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown\\" and \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" can still bring anger, produce a sense of unfairness.  \\"With God on Our Side\\" is a powerful statement regarding the manner in which religion can make some people feel superior to others, with whatever relevant God is on their side.  \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" suggests the reality of an elite manipulating the mass of people; whether or not one agree with the theme, the argument is well portrayed. So, too, \\"North Country Blues\\" has a statement to make.<br /><br />There are, in addition, softer tunes, such as \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" and \\"Boots of Spanish Leather.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a must buy for those wanting to understand the full body of Bob Dylan's work.  Perhaps the best of his pre-electric corpus.

His own music, with those witty lyrics, those images of absurdity (listen to \\"Talkin' World War III Blues\\"), along with the spare guitar/harmonica format.  And that voice!<br /><br />One of the striking things about this classic Dylan CD is that some of the least known songs are still great.  I still enjoy listening to \\"Talkin' World War III Blues\\" to this day.  The story of his expropriating a Cadillac; his listening to Rock-a-Day Johnnie singing \\"Where's your ma, where's your pa; Our love's a gonna grow, ooh-ahh, ooh, ahh\\"; his conversation with a telephone operator; etc.  \\"Oxford Town\\" is a great couple minutes that lays out the key underlying aspects of the racism of the South that called for a Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />And, of course, there are some of his early \\"political\\" classics represented here: \\"Blowin' in the Wind,\\" \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"A Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall.\\"<br /><br />This album also features some of his gentler songs, such as \\"Girl from the North Country\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice, It's all right.\\"<br /><br />This CD holds up awfully well over time!  Those who want to know about the early Dylan would be well advised to listen to this CD.
0743298020|5.0|As most of the other reviews testify, this is a powerful and beautifully written book. It is evocative of a lost style of writing, leisurely and insightful, and trusting in the reader's intelligence. One aspect of this book not widely addressed, it seems to me, is Setterfield's passionate exploration of the power of grief. Human loss is not assuaged by tasteful cards, flowers, and clichés about moving on, but sweeps over a person like a wave of stunning emotions, crushing and changing those who most try to come to terms with a permanent alteration in their private universe. Grief can affect the lives even of those unaware of the loss, as is the case with Setterfield's characters, as though it were a genetic ailment. In this regard, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" raises some important and disturbing questions about human cruelty and its consequences.
0790731940|4.0|I recently saw the movie Maverick again, after not having viewed it for some time.  I was reminded how delightful the enterprise was--and enjoyed again the boffo ending.<br /><br />In the movie, Mel Gibson plays Brett Maverick (the role essayed on television so many years ago by James Garner); James Garner plays Sheriff Zane Cooper; Jodie Foster does a nice turn as Annabelle Bransford, a larcenous gambler; Graham Graham overacts to excess, playing a Native American leader; James Coburn is Commodore Duvall, the man who organizes an \\"All-Star\\" high stakes poker match on his riverboat.<br /><br />The plot has Maverick trying to acquire the money needed to enter the poker game.  In his wanderings, he runs across Mrs. Bransford, Angel (played by Alfred Molina), and others.  The poker game itself is fun for older viewers.  We see some of the following characters from an earlier era of television: Doug McClure (who starred in one of those great Westerns from the 1950s and early 1960s), Paul Brinegar, Denver Pyle, Dan Hedaya, and so on.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun, with some over the top scenes (e.g., the segment focusing on Native Americans) diminishing the whole.  However, Gibson does a solid job as Maverick; Garner is his usual dependable self as an actor; Foster plays her role well; Coburn's character is well drawn.<br /><br />All in all, worth giving another view if you have seen it before and worth a first look if not.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|THE COVENANT is actually pretty tame to be called a \\"horror\\" film; there's little bloodletting and even the scenes with the spiders aren't that frightening.  As horror viewers, maybe we've become immune since there isn't much we haven't been treated to over the years.<br /><br />Anyway, this film features a good looking bunch of kids in a New England setting.  Four of our heroes are called \\"The Sons of Ipwich,\\" descendants of families of witches.  These guys basically use their powers in a mischievous fashion.  The lead guy, Caleb, is about to turn 18, and when he does he will \\"ascend\\" with increased powers....but with a catch...the more he uses his powers, the older he becomes so it's best to be cautious with these seductive powers.  A fifth warlock enters the picture, and he's definitely out for the most power he can get.<br /><br />The battles staged by DIE HARD's director Renny Harlin are typical fast motion stunts but bear little if any real terror aspects.  The ending leaves room for a sequel but the film did poorly at the box office, so if there is a COVENANT 2, it will most likely be direct to DVD.

B000ICM5IK|4.0|While this album puports to be a \\"best-of\\" collection of all the Rocky music, there are key tracks missing that would have made this album an absolute knockout.

Two other very worthy Rocky soundtracks that should have been included are \\"War\\" and \\"Training Montage\\" from Rocky IV.  I also missed \\"Marines' Hymn/Yankee Doodle\\" (Apollo Creed's theme).<br /><br />While this is a good anthology of the essential Rocky movie music themes, it would have been better if it were made into a 2-disc collection and included the tracks previously mentioned, (and more).<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig

While the music is good, it does not rise to the heights of inspiration of the first two albums.  It seems that this album is either one you like or hate, with little room in-between.  Personally, I found middle ground and gave it a 4-star ranking.<br /><br />This album has more vocal tracks than instrumental, a switch for Rocky theme music.  The vocals have meaningful lyrics and are at times very moving music, such as \\"Burning Heart\\" and \\"No Easy Way Out\\".  James Brown contributes a lively, \\"Living In America\\", that will get your blood moving.  Recycled from Rocky III is (the) \\"Eye of the Tiger\\".<br /><br />There are two new instrumental compositions by Vince Dicola, \\"War\\" and \\"Training Montage\\".  Both are inspiring numbers and capture the heart of a boxer's training regimen and his battle in the ring.<br /><br />Over all, I enjoyed this album.  It makes great personal exercise music.  However, I longed for Bill Conti's touch, and missed his stirring themes.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig
0446677450|5.0|I have always wanted to invest, but have always felt overwhelmed with it all and never knew where to begin.  This is the book.  Though it doesn't outline a lot of specifics to investing it shows that yes, investing can be difficult and confusing, but gives great advice to beginners.  It will take me a little more time to learn and invest, but I feel confident that I will succeed.  A must for any person who wants to begin making their money work for them.  Wish I would have read this book 10 years ago.
032147404X|4.0|I found this book useful and was a very quick read.  It is basically a bunch of photographic situations and advice on how to deal with them.  Overall I was pleased with it and am glad I bought it. <br />However...  his humor is really a waste of time.  Whole paragraphs are devoted to not letting a bad joke die.  If you were to strip the photo's and the jokes out of this book, it would be 25 pages long.

B00005JPAJ|1.0|I place this as one of the worst movies ever produced.  The big name actors and actresses do not have much footage, and what footage they star in, is less than deserving. <br /> <br />The movie obviously is out to shock the average American with the hectic culture of Japan, the poor but caring (and backwards) culture of Mexico, and the difficult and misunderstood (at least by Americans) culture of Morocco. <br /> <br />This movie also has it all; sex, nudity, violence, romance, fowl language, etc...when it didn't need any of this.  This is the main problem of this movie, they tried to do too much in everyway, yet it is an extremely boring and slow movie.  It's also a tense movie as you wait for the Japanese girl to be raped or to commit suicide, Brad's wife to die, the Moroccan family to be slaughtered by the police, and the kid's who were dragged to the wedding in Mexico to have something bad to happen to them or to die in the desert.  Everything works out great in the end though for everyone (of course), except the poor dead Moroccan kid shot to death by the police, or did he die? - they left this hanging as a loose end never confirming his death, or showing the alternate path in the second time dimension.  Maybe this was done subliminally since it was only the death of an Arab. <br /> <br />Then to top it off, if three cultures and three crisis's isn't enough, they have to add a time dimension to the movie where two paths exist through time - one where the wife dies and the illegal Mexican immigrant housekeeper goes to Mexico for the wedding bringing the children along, and another where the wife doesn't die and the illegal Mexican immigrant housekeeper is relieved from her duties and goes to Mexico alone for the wedding.  Why they felt it necessary to add two paths I don't know.  The death at the start of the movie is to bait you into thinking the wife dies, but it was actually the loss of one of their children, and the whole reason they started their tourist trip in Morocco.  You don't figure this out till the very end, if at all, same for the two paths through time.  I think a lot of people (like my wife) don't pick-up on these two twists. <br /> <br />Then the flaws in the movie's logic.  How did the Mexican border patrol get a phone number to call Brad Pitt at while he is in this remote village in Morocco watching his wife die, and they were able to track him down immediately too?  How were the Moroccan police able to so quickly track down the hunting rifle to a Japanese business man in Japan, all in what must have been hours at most?  Good police in Morocco as well, they are able to locate bullet casings very quickly on top of mountain ranges, while in reality today we can't even track down a crashed jet liner. <br /> <br />I just can't stop about this movie - it is sooooooooooo bad.  I guess I'll have to take a few drags off the pipe handed to me by the leather-faced opium smoking Moroccan grandma next time before viewing this film.  Then MAYBE I'll like it and understand it.
B000H305U0|3.0|I'll admit I am not a fan of NSYNC. I felt they took popular music to the bubblegum factory, but I suppose for teenage girls they were the right safe formula.<br /><br />I wasn't interested in Justin Timberlake's 2002 \\"Justified\\". However, I thought \\"Rock Your Body\\" was a great Michael Jackson knockoff. Enter Timberlake's sophomore album \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\". It picks up where \\"Rock Your Body\\" left off. When Timberlake is good, he's very good, and when he's out of ideas, the entire disc nearly derails itself.<br /><br />The best tracks are the first single \\"Sexyback\\" with it's Michael Jackson and Prince imitations, the second single \\"My Love\\", the third single \\"What Goes Around...\\" which might be the best track here, \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" and \\"Lovestoned\\". On these five tracks Timberlake and Timberland are virtually irresistable and unstoppable. However, this doesn't hold up across all 12 tracks.<br /><br />In fact, the second half of the disc is bogged down in weak hip hop/raps and drippy balladry. I particularly hated the Rick Rubin produced \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\". \\"Chop Me Up\\" was boring. \\"Damn Girl\\" has a catchy r&b retro 70's feel, but it's nothing special. \\"Summer Love\\" is all right as is \\"Losing My Way\\". I didn't like \\"Until The End Of Time\\" either, and \\"Sexy Ladies\\" is definitely a Prince rip-off. In fact, \\"Until The End Of Time\\" utilizes the old drum machine effects from Prince's \\"1999\\" album. Some of the interludes were interesting like \\"Let Me Talk To You\\", \\"I Think She Knows\\" and \\"...Comes Around\\", while \\"Set The Mood\\" was sickly sweet.<br /><br />One thing that makes a great singer (because as far as I can tell Timberlake doesn't play an instrument) is his ability to adapt to a wide genre of styles. Timberlake has done two albums that are heavily r&b/hip hop influenced. Until he stretches himself artistically by dumping Timberland and Rick Rubin and going with different producers on each album, I consider him a budding artist who hasn't yet reached his full potential. Michael Jackson was very good at many different styles and that's what made him a legend. Same for Rod Stewart, and Timberlake will never come close to touching Prince unless he learns to write, play, compose, arrange and produce everything he does.<br /><br />So, the bottom line with \\"Futuresex/Lovesounds\\" is that there are five great songs and seven mediocre songs, thus the three star rating.<br /><br />Maybe next time Timberlake with take even greater artistic risks which might lead to greater rewards and an even larger audience.ael Jackson was very good at many different styles and that's what made him a legend.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins' work is the great ally of Sam Harris's 'The End of Faith' and a lesser known work, Lucien Gregoire's 2006 biography of the 33-day pope 'Murder in the Vatican: The Revolutionary Life of John Paul'.  A reporter once challenged John Paul on being an atheist. He replied, \\"Don't fool yourself, we are all agnostic. The greatest atheist with his science cannot disprove the existence of God, whereas the greatest theologian with his tall tales cannot prove the existence of God. Yet, when one considers the way `God' makes children, that many are born only to suffer unspeakable lives and die unspeakable deaths, the weight of evidence heavily favors the atheist.\\"  <br /> <br />John Paul's atheist father, who had spent a lifetime trying to change the Church from the outside, decided it could only be changed from the inside. He placed his son in a minor seminary at the age of eleven with the commission to bring change to the world. A year later, the boy wrote an article in the school newspaper that reached all of Europe, demanding that nations live up to their copyright laws and place a warning on the Old Testament, \\"This is a work of fiction. Keep away from children.\\"  Most laughed at the boy. Many of them were Jews. Had the western world heeded the boy's warning, to the extent that 'Mein Kampf' was inspired by the Aryan ideology of the Old Testament, we might have been spared WWII and the Holocaust. This is still true today. The state remains derelict in its duty in not placing, at the very least, a warning on the Old Testament. Today, as proved in Gregoire's book, we know as absolute fact, that Moses tales were not only fairytales, they were lies for personal profit. <br /> <br />In the 2006 edition of Gregoire's book, John Paul tells a group of bishops, \\"The fundamental difference between the Christian and the atheist is that the Christian believes in the supernatural and the atheist does not. Only the atheist accepts the true God of Nature, the God we know as a matter of absolute fact gives us life for a given period of time.  The Christian does not accept the God that we know as a matter of absolute fact gives us life. He believes that certain ghosts appeared to some of his ancestors and told them `He' was `God'.  `He' promised them a better life through miracles and an opportunity to live forever in exchange for holding women, Negroes, homosexuals, bastards and others to be subordinate human beings.\\" <br /> <br />Gregoire, employing the massive record John Paul left behind him in the press, totally annihilates the credibility of the enemy's book. He paves the way for Dawkins, Harris and the others in their struggle for the truth.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|4.0|My sister called me from New York and told me to go watch Serenity. I did and immediately purchased the Firefly series. It was great. I have no idea why the series was cancelled, it was working into a top notch tale and seems to have a pretty dedicated cast. The cinematography was excellent and the story line intreguing. There are not that many space operas left. What there is left of this one is well worth watching. Sure wish there was more!
B0006PV5VC|5.0|\\"The Song of the Nightingale\\" is not my favorite Stravinsky...it just doesn't work that well as a piece of music, especially when compared to the opera original (which is an oddity itself). But Reiner makes it work somehow: the pacing is terrific and the playing as usual is razor-sharp. \\"Scheherazade\\" may be pretty tired by now but when you hear this performance it comes to life again and you realize why it has been such a popular score. Sure there are other ways to play it but this one is sensational...and the last movement was done in a single take!

0452287588|5.0|The old saying goes' If it sounds too good to be true it probably is\\".  Mr. Tolle presents his insights but has no method.  This is the path of surrender and while it had been recommended since Shiva made love with Devi, it is not the path most will achieve enlightenment through. I will not comment on Tolle's achievement; I am not here to judge.  I will say that the experience of enlightenment is the only human pursuit that sweetens this experience of life we are in.  It is like having your cake, your frosting, and being able to eat it as well.  If you could read this book and achieve surrender through that effort it would be worth its weight in diamonds.  If you can't achieve surrender through your efforts I recommend a teacher such as Prem Rawat who provides the aspirant with a practical knowledge and discipline that works to bring one into the experience of peace, fulfillment, and enlightenment, etc. etc..  So read and listen to Tolle if you want, perhaps you can also achieve the surrender he speaks of.  If you can't go to a true perfect master who can teach you the proper discipline where your effort will be rewarded.

My son even asked for it to be his birthday party theme and he never does TV themes.  I have read several of the reviews that people have posted on here and would have to say that I am a little concerned about the people who have a problem with the movie's language.  I do not think that it is any different then any other children's movie and a lot better then what my son comes home with from school and he is in kindergarten.  I would recommend this move to car and non car lovers alike.  A great movie sure to become a classic!
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|but this is what I believe to be Incubus's worst album. No, it is not terrible by any means, but I loved and I mean LOVED A Crow Left of the Murder but this is going back a step. Crow was a very experimental album with an array of sounds, somethign you don't find with a lot of mainstream bands but I loved it. This, on the other hand is what I like to call the sell-out album. It's way too commercial for them. There are a couple good songs like \\"Dig\\", \\"love hurts\\" and of course, \\"Anna Molly\\" but there isn't enough on here. And another thing that bothered me, albeit stupid is it's really damn short. Sorta feels rushed to me. Most Incubus CDs are very solid from beginning to end and a good length but this just has a couple of good songs and too much filler and not enough thought put into it. Hopefully, for the next album they can put more effort into it.
0765310015|5.0|Gardens of the Moon (1999) is the first Fantasy novel of the Malazan Book of the Fallen.  Once three companies of Malazan marines, light infantry and sappers pursued a party of twelve Seven Cities wizards into the Holy Desert of Raraku.  During the deadly pursuit, the desert burned the bodies and souls of both groups and the wizards died one by one.  Somewhere in the sands, the last living wizard waited and then merged with his pursuers.  All those who exited the desert had their bridges burned behind them.    These are the tales of the Bridgeburners and of those who knew, met and were influenced by these men and women.  Among the Malazans who entered the desert were Whiskeyjack, Fiddler and Hedge.  Kalam Mekhar -- the Seven Cities assassin -- was also among the pursuers.  Among the Seven Cities wizards was Adaephon Ben Derlat -- Quick Ben -- the only one who survived.  After the Raraku Desert, Quick Ben and Kalam became Bridgeburners, Quick Ben as a cadre mage and Kalam as a Claw.  Later Kalam became the Master of a Claw Hand for the Emperor, but returned to the Bridgeburners as a Corporal after Laseen became Empress.    In this novel, Ganoes Stabro Paran met a Bridgeburner on the parapets of Mock's Hold when he was twelve years old.  The man was a company commander in the 3rd Army under High Fist Darrem Ultor.  During their discussion, Ganoes declared that he wanted to be a soldier, but the commander suggested otherwise.    Seven years later, Ganoes is a Lieutenant in Itko Kan when the Hounds of Shadow destroy the Nineteenth Regiment of the Eighth Cavalry.  Afterward, Cotillion takes possession of the girl who would become Sorry.  Adjunct Lorn uses Paran to search for other strange occurrences associated with the massacre and then later binds him to her service.    On the continent of Genabackis, Dujek Onearm is High Fist commanding the siege of Pale.  High Mage Tayschreen announces that he will lead a magical attack on Moon's Spawn, the huge rock floating over Pale that is the seat of Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andit.  He leads three other High Mages and the 2nd Army mage cadre in the assault.    Tattersail is the only survivor of the mage cadre.  Death had fallen from Moon's Spawn, but the sorcerous attacks on the mages had come from the plains.  She suspects treachery from High Mage Tayschreen.    In Unta, Paran meets the Empress once again and then is briefed by Adjunct Lorn.  He is being sent to Pale to take command of the Ninth Squad of the Bridgeburners, Whiskeyjack's squad.  He will be its fourth Captain in three years.    In Pale, after meeting several of the Bridgeburners, Paran is waylaid and stabbed outside the barracks by Cotillion in Sorry's body.  However, he is saved by Oponn -- the Ascendant Twins of Chance -- and then tended by Tattersail the Sorceress.  Meanwhile, Whiskeyjack leads the Ninth on an infiltration of Darujhistan, the last free city on Genabackis.    In this story, the mages draw their powers from the Warrens, other realms amidst the Chaos outside reality.  The Elder Warrens, including the Warrens of Dark, Shadow and Light, provide the most potent magic and thus power the most puissant mages.  Although these Warrens can be drawn from by any mage, the Houses of each realm  are ruled by Gods and other Ascendants.  Hood rules the House of Death, the most powerful of the human realms.      Although not explicitly stated within this novel, the commander whom Paran met on the Mock's Hold parapet was probably Whiskeyjack.  While a squad sargeant in this novel, Whiskeyjack had been a company commander when Ganoes was twelve, with Dujek under his command.  The Bridgeburners had been the Emperor's favorite unit, but after Laseen became Empress, the Bridgeburner leaders were demoted and the unit was sent out on the dirtiest jobs.  The Bridgeburner name is still legendary among the troops, regardless of the desires of the Empress.    This novel is an epic fantasy, so the panorama of names and places is very confusing at times.  As the story extends to other locales, the context grows richer and the confusion grows wilder.  The dramatis personae and glossary of this novel were much used during the reading.    Highly recommended for Erikson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of imperial society, military operations and godly intrigue.    -Arthur W. Jordin

B000001EXR|4.0|I recently have gotten into Kiss and love their glory days back in the 70s with CD's such as their debut, Destroyer and Rock and Roll Over among others. However, recently I thought I'd give some of their newER stuff a try and lo and behold, I loved REVENGE. It was an album of a definite new, rougher attitude, but then I ran across this album and to be honest with you, when I saw it at the CD store, I got this bad feeling. The cover just seemed more like a extras disc but it looked like new songs, so I was like what the hell? I'll get it anyways.<br /><br />I was very pleased to see that this album was very solid and how they managed to pull it off without much of their previous sound, as many of you know this is their grunge album. The interesting thing is why they did this since it came out in 1997 when grunge was virtually dead but it is a success nonetheless. Very heavy stuff but also still has the Kiss sound. I reccomend this CD highly to any Kiss fan or any grunge fan for that matter.

Actually, I enjoyed the audio after reading the book gaining mental confirmations. Good to Great, in my judgment, is motivational and inspiring to the extent that it provides the reader (and listener to audio) new ideas to apply. It will probably not help me become a billionaire in the next few months or even years. Yet the principles and analysis of the human leaders of the corporations was enlightening and enjoyable. To me, Good to Great, was a modern day Napoleon Hill effort to identify \\"Keys to Success.\\" I will listen to the audio again as I travel from time-to-time so it was worth the investment.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|<br />\\"When you want me, but do not need me, then I have to go.\\"  These lines quoted from the 2005 film \\"Nanny McPhee\\" exquisitely summarize the core of its plot.  Nanny McPhee, played by the Oscar-award-winning actress Emma Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay for the film and portrayed the character of Professor Trelawney in the 2004 film \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"), comes to the home of widower Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) who is also the father of seven rowdy children.  Mr. Brown, who has received financial assistance from the children's' aging Aunt Adelaide (the very talented Angela Lansbury), informs Mr. Brown that she will cut-off the assistance if he doesn't wed within a month.  Having unsuccessfully attempted to find a nanny able to deal with his seven children, the mysterious & unattractive Nanny McPhee arrives at his door one day to take on the responsibility.  While facing strong initial opposition from the children in the form of pranks, Nanny McPhee begins to take hold of the dysfunctional family while Mr. Brown attempts to woo the bizarre widow Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie).  As the children begin to warm to Nanny McPhee, they do not want their father to marry Mrs. Quickly; and Aunt Adelaide doesn't help matters when she decides to remove one of his children to raise herself.  Aunt Adelaide is unwittingly outsmarted by the children when their scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) pretends to be one of the children and is adopted by Aunt Adelaide.   <br /> <br />Does Mr. Brown marry the hideous Mrs. Quickly?  Why does Nanny McPhee begin to become more attractive over time?  Will the children ever see the very kind Evangeline ever again?  The answers to these questions can be found by watching this enchantingly engaging film.  Though reminiscent of the famous 1964 classic \\"Mary Poppins\\", \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is quite unique and stands on its own as a wonderful film thanks to the talented screen writing capabilities of Emma Thompson, who wrotethe screenplay based upon the book by Christianna Brand (1907-1988), and the wonderful direction of Kirk Jones.  Equally engaging were the elaborate & colorful costumes used in the film, as well as the imaginative sets and crisp cinematography.  Overall, I rate \\"Nanny McPhee\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.  Emma Thompson is reprising her role of Professor Trelawney in the 2007 film \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\". <br />

Foxx decides that the slim attractive Knowles needs to front the group instead of the full figured Hudson, to cross into the mainstream of pop music.

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Incubus is one of the only good groups that can still make any impact on the charts nowadays. However, this album has some incredible songs, and some not so incredible songs. <br /> <br />\\"Anna-Molly\\", Incubus's first single, is a good song, but merely a repeat of what they did on 'Make Yourself'. It's nothing new or innovative, but still is vintage Incubus. <br /> <br />On \\"Dig\\" and \\"Love Hurts\\", Incubus incorporates modern pop in order to maintain chart credibility. Based on the overall sound of the album, it almost sounds forced. Incubus are better than that. <br /> <br />\\"Pendulous Threads\\" and \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" stand out as the album's killer rockers. \\"Pendulous Threads\\" is a Sonic Youth-esque wall of noise and distortion, moderated by a Pearl Jam-esque verse. Absolutely fantastic song. \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" recalls my personal favorite Incubus song \\"Circles\\", with a hard riff and a melodic verse taking turns.  <br /> <br />This album outdoes its predecessor \\"A Crow Left Of The Murder...\\", but is not quite at the band's popular peak with 'Make Yourself' and 'Morning View'. I'd recommend starting with those two albums, and maybe 'Fungus Amongus', which demonstrates their roots in early Chili Peppers'-esque funk-rock.
B00003CXDB|4.0|A good look into the Jungle of Big Business, the Corruption of Power, Personal Growth, and morality.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Like Das Boot, this movie sucks the viewer into another world, a ship-board world, for a three-hour journey that will have your eyes riveted to the screen.  It checks all the blocks:  actors, script, direction, special effects, editing, and so on.  You can watch it at least three times and will still find it entertaining from start to finish.  Brilliantly done period piece with a military and nautical theme; it's a war movie with class.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|Well.., i am not an expert in temperature and stuff like that.., and i didn't test the product with another program such Sandra (to say a program to monitor it) the only i can say, if that before, the monitor that comes with the bios of my intel motherboard, showed 50 degrees, now its shows near 45, and i can feel more fresh the air coming out of the tower, and i hear the fans working less than before...<br /><br />I think this product its excelent and at least do what is says it does...,
B000EHSVS2|3.0|I have always loved the movie \\"Patton\\".  It is a true classic and a treasure in cinema.  I give 3 stars to this special edition because of the following reasons. I cannot understand why 20th Century Fox chose to add the Documentary \\"Ghost Corp\\" which seems to want to imply that Patton abandoned the XX Corp and particularly the 94th Infantry deliberately with no reason.  Horrible incidences happen in war, this one happened because Patton was on his way north to fight a little annoyance called THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE!, also he was going to rescue the 101st Airborne surrounded by German Forces at Bastogne from being ANNIHILATED!. In the documentary \\"The making of Patton\\" there is a clip from Oliver Stone stating that the movie \\"Patton\\" was responsible for Nixon invading and bombing Cambodia, which, according to Oliver Stone, forced the Khmer Rouge to kill millions of Cambodians.  He states that only two movies he knows of ever influenced history; \\"Patton\\" and of course his movie \\"JFK\\".  Naturally his (Oliver Stone)'s movie was in a good way.  \\"Patton\\" just caused destruction and death.  My view of this is that 20th Century Fox wanted to be politically correct and shield itself from anyone anywhere at anytime thinking that they would glorify war.  I have never ever heard of a single person thinking seriously that the movie \\"Patton\\" glorified war. Whoever thought that at Fox is an idiot and obviously does not think much of the audiences' intelligence that watched \\"Patton\\".  Oliver Stone is simply pitiful. He wishes that he could make a movie that would live in people's hearts like \\"Patton\\" does.  He will never touch that greatness, his films will never obtain that level of affection in people's hearts. People don't love \\"Patton\\" because it is a war picture.  We love it because it is great, it resonates in our hearts and it gave us an image of a complex man and the great men around him who sacrificed, bled, and accomplished heroic deeds.  It is positive and gives us hope,unlike the depressing, hopeless, and disposable garbage that Oliver Stone puts out.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Although Star Trek V may not be hailed by Star Trek Fans as \\"The Greatest Star Trek of All Time,\\" its not without its merit.  As far the DVD, it has what you are looking for.  The second disc has all the behind the scene's stuff, and interviews that you have come to expect from Two-Disc specials.
B00005JOLI|2.0|If you haven't read the books, it is not a bad move for kids 9-14 and some adults who like fantasy.  However, my son (13) and I have read the books and it just falls miserably FLAT!!<br /><br />First off, Arya has red hair and no pointy elf ears!!  She acts and feels too young and flighty the whole movie.  Secondly, right from the beginning there are King's soldiers in Carvahall where Eragon lives -- not ever in the book and for very good reasons!!  Next, Saphira does not have beautiful gem like scales and membrane on her wings -- she has snake-like skin and feathers??  Also, instead of showing Eragon taking her and making her nest in the woods and feeding her and then maybe a speeded up part to show over a few months how fast she grows, the director has Saphira take off thrown into the sky by Eragon when quite small (4-5 feet long from head to tail) and then magically in the sky she grows and comes down full-sized!!  This was NOT just a device -- this was it as no seasons changed, etc.  And finally, for me, the worst part was that Galbatorix and Durza are trying to KILL Eragon and Saphira instead of capture!!  In the book as made sense, Galbatorix wanted to capture Eragon and Saphira and turn them to HIS side.  That for me is just a major issue.<br /><br />Now what was good?  If you haven't read the book, the darkness of the village and Urgals.  The flights of Eragon on Saphira were very cool and the final battle.<br /><br />If you haven't read the books, I recommend it as a fun movie!!<br /><br />If you have read the books, wait for the DVD.<br /><br />Oh and Christopher Paolini?  Please if you do a sequel get a better director and make Saphira look right and Arya too!!!
B00004YA66|5.0|This is my favorite movie, tears not withstanding.  This is the only DVD I actually bought to own.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Brand new DVD arrived in a timely fashion during the holiday rush.  A pleasure to do business with.
B000083C49|5.0|This movie surely was a different way to go in the Star Trek Movies, but it is very enjoyable, and in my opinion one of the best of the series.  I am not sure how to say it, but it just seems more real.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed this movie. It was a little slow to get started, but once the first torture scene happened the movie just took off. I thought the torture scenes were really well put together. It felt like you were in the room with the torturer, expiriencing it first-hand. I thought that the first torture scene with Derek Richardson was AWESOME, although Derek Richardson's facial expressions right before he was going to be drilled through did not look very real. He looked like he was about to laugh. Hostel had a really dark, mysterious feel to it, which I thought significantly hightened the terror. I thought that the nudity was WAY overdone and that there was just to much of it. The end of the movie is SO satisfying. It felt good even as a viewer, to see Jay Hernandez let Dutch Guy \\"have it\\" because he was the real villin in this movie and he was probably the only person in the film who actually \\"diserved\\" to get killed. If you have a weak stomache, than this movie is probably not your thing. But if you think you can handle it, than you should give it a try. A solid 4 stars.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|This movie desperately needed one thing: a script. Some of the dialog in this film is so bad I just busted out laughing. Like the \\"miss muffet\\" line. Or the \\"weoch.\\" I think the story might actually be a good one, it's just that the script is just terrible. The directing is pretty good. Clean, script images and kinda nice special effects. That's what saved this movie. It's not horrible. And for once, men are treated as sex objects instead of women. But that was sort of a problem for me because the guys kinda all looked alike. Except for the blond guy and the long haired guy. And there were 4 of them, but only 1 that ever got to do anything. The other 3 were kinda pointless.<br /><br />I think this movie deserves a sequel. Just get a decent script and you might have something.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Since the time of Star Wars, or maybe even before, we have seen and enjoyed the western set in outer space or through science fiction. And we've seen the darker side of the myth of the cliché riddled western hero bring home the best picture Oscar for Unforgiven.   Serenity is a nice addition to this new style of western hero.    <br /> <br />Nathan Fillion as the captain of an interplanetary space ship brings as much life to his role of Captain Malcolm Reynolds as Harrison Ford brings to Indiana Jones or Hans Solo.   He's on the lamb from an oppressive \\"big brother\\" type galactic government. Reynolds sneaks just under the radar doing some odd jobs just south of legal to keep his ship and crew intact. His struggling business is barely operational and all he cares about is his freedom, his crew, and not much else.  <br /> <br />Through his amazement he discovers one of his crew happens to be public enemy number one to the galactic police and now the choice of sacrificing his crew and/or his freedom has to be made.   Something got to give, and not everyone is happy with the choice. <br /> <br />I saw the film before I saw the series, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I immediately rented the series, and then watched the movie again...and LOVED the film <br /> <br />The series is uneven, but generally good.  But the character development that's added in the series makes the movie great. <br /> <br />I simply can't recommend it enough, and I hope to see Nathan Fillion in many more movies to come. <br /> <br />
B000GY729M|2.0|Did the Killers forget how to write a hook? \\"When You Were Young\\" is the only listenable song on here. Get it off itunes and forget you ever wanted to visit Sam's Town.
B000ICM5VW|4.0|By now we should all know the story of King Kong. It all hinges on whether or not you can believe that such a savage \\"creature\\" can actually fall in love with a beautiful woman and that she can love him, too. By the end of this 3 hour plus film you will be brought to tears if you have a heart. Peter Jackson pushes emotional buttons in much the way he did in the Lord of the Rings films so when you watch expect to gripped in a way only he can. It is a distinctly Peter Jackson film. The natives on Skull Island just remind me so much of the orcs in LOTR, too. <br /> <br />Naomi Watts does a good job of showing her love for Kong in a way similar to the story of Beauty and the Beast. In fact the way this version of King Kong is put together does have some elements of Beauty and the Beast with Kong being tamed by a beautiful woman and a score of men hunting the beast because they fear him. Although the way this ends is decidely less uplifting but no less emotionally gripping than that fairy tale. <br /> <br />You will want to see Jack Black dead by the end of the movie. He plays the movie producer that risks the lives of his crew to make a fortune. When that bombs with the death of several crew members and finally the destruction of the camera he hatches a scheme to capture Kong again for the sake of greed. <br /> <br />On the negative side there seems to be too many sequences where the movie almost becomes Jurassic Park squeezed into the middle of the movie. We have Brontosaur type dinosaurs, small T-Rex type dinosaurs, and the classic huge T-Rex. The scene where Kong fights several T-Rexes in this version is quite awesome.  <br /> <br />On the technical side this HD-DVD offers wonderful picture quality and crisp Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 audio. I have no complaints there. It is a solid 4 stars out of 5.   <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|4.0|We bought this CD as we were going to see the stage show. Both show and CD are first rate. The music grows on you as you become familiar with it.
055358202X|4.0|Martin continues his series but leaves us hanging, but he does apologize at the end.I for one eagerly await the next book.He seems to get darker with each book so I am rating it slightly lower.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|This is a great Sundance film. As the mystery unravels it creates an emotional connection between you and the main character as he embarks on the tortuous task of unveiling who killed his x-girlfriend. This film is good enough to keep your attention throughout and offers a twist in the end. Other than a few slow spots that are necessary, this film is worth having in your home collection. <br />enjoy.
B000005JA8|5.0|The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed. The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for. Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However, if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating myself to the full experience: \\"Ella Guru\\", \\"Dachaus Blues\\", \\"Dust Blows Forward\\", \\"Neone Meat Dream\\", and \\"Old Fart at Play\\" stick out.
B000J103YI|5.0|To the person who said Jennifer Hudson did not top Jennifer Holliday; evendently you did not see the same movie I did \\"Dream Girls.\\" Jennifer Hudson was superior in her performance.  She should win an Oscar for her performance.
B000J103PC|2.0|This is a movie billed as a comedy, though it is rarely entertaining, much less funny.  Streep is a brilliant performer, and Tucci makes a stereotype (one of many in the film) tolerable.  It is hard to determine if this is intended as a straightforward comedy with some sort of message, or a message story with some hint of comedy.  Either way, it comes across as a ham-handed story sodden with every kind of platitude imaginable about salt of the earth virtue despoiled by the pernicious effects of vanity and power.  Perhaps if the whole thing had been done as a cartoon it would not be so grating.  By the end of the movie my head was pounding and I wanted all of these cardboard cutout characters with their paint by number lines to just go away.  This may be an interesting film to those who enjoy fantasizing about the world of high fashion, but if that doesn't strike you as interesting, I would not recommend investing time or money in seeing it.
B00005JPE7|4.0|There's a scene in the beginning of `Rocky Balboa' where I thought of Bruce Springsteen's famous song, \\"Glory Days\\".  Rocky has long since retired from boxing and has bought an Italian restaurant in Philly.  One night he's schmoozing with his guests from table to table.  He's enthusiastically telling his favorite stories in the ring when one guest cuts him off to finish the ending.   They've heard it all before.  And so have we.  In the Springsteen song, there's the punch line, \\"...The time of glory...leaves you with nothing, Mister, but boring stories of...glory days.\\"  They weren't boring; it's just there's nothing new to tell.   The rest of the movie finds Rocky wanting to make new stories.  Seldom does `Rocky Balboa' seem like a sentimental reunion that only clings to the past.  Rather, the flashbacks melt well into the present day.  What we know goes well with what's new.      Adrianne has died and their son, Rocky, Jr. (Burt Young) has grown into a semi-successful white collar worker.  He's the apple of dad's eye, but Rocky's own \\"glory days\\" cast a shadow on his son.  He offers his son some philosophical words we can all take to heart:  \\"It's not how hard you fight in life.  It's how hard you can take the punches...\\"  Rocky still has ties with Paulie (Burt Young) the one who lent him the meat locker.  His advice to Rocky is also sage:  \\"You're living life backwards, Rocco...Change channels.\\"  So the aging Rocky clings to his memories of Adriane, pains after years of physical strain, and his reluctant retirement.  As one might guess, he gets a second chance.  I was so impressed with the development, I had to smile at how Sylvester Stallone pulled it off .    Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is that second chance.  A notorious champion, Dixon's a prima dona who doesn't give his opponents much of a chance.  (He reminds us of the contrast between growing up watching Ali and Frasier fight splendidly for free and today's debacles on Pay-per-view.)  Once opponents and ahuge audience seem elusive, Dixon's promoters brainstorm an exhibition fight with Rocky, one that is meant to create interest, partly as a fund-raiser.   It also is meant to resolve ESPN's speculative computer simulation of two boxers from different eras match up.       With some effective scenes that warm up the heart between Paulie, an old acquaintance Marie (Geraldine Hughes), her grown son, Rocky's son--and the loving bond they share despite their differences--there's plenty of tender moments.  (And none of them stem from the meat locker.)  Then, they put on a fine show.  Plausible developments come to the fore in the ring where Stallone's stylish freeze-frame approach manages well with the poignant flashbacks, artfully done like none before in the 'Rocky' franchise.  'Rocky Balboa' offers many rounds of heartfelt entertainment and wisely ducks from any false sentimentality.
B000059TEQ|3.0|The sentimentality of \\"Love Story\\" (\\"What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?\\") is a hearty welcome retreat to the past... There is nothing to spoil love, trust, confidence or even the events... Jenny seems to die... She just escapes in loveliness...<br /><br />Jenny (Ali MacGraw) is half of a pretty young married students from a working class background... And Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) is from a very wealthy family... Both have the predictable problems with disapproving parents... Both struggle along through hard times, until Oliver obtains a fine job with his own merit... When Jenny tries to get pregnant, the doctor finds out that she has an incurable disease, and has a very short time to live...<br /><br />Ryan O'Neal plays well the intense sensitive rebel, giving a heart-breaking performance as the ultra-rich man's son who works to pay his way through law school when his father won't...<br /><br />Ali MacGraw is good and touching in her portrait of Jenny, the dying heroine, the poor baker's daughter studying classical music at Radcliffe, the smart young girl who gives up her plans to study in Europe in order to marry Oliver... She never missed a 'shred of her beauty' in her role...<br /><br />Ray Milland is the 60-year-old Oliver Barrett III... He is a strong, articulate, civilized millionaire from Boston who refuses to support his son in marrying a girl of such low social stature... He commands him instead to finish law school...<br /><br />John Harley is Phil, the father of Jenny... For him, \\"Father's love is something to cherish and respect.\\"<br /><br />There is three sequences that I liked the most in the film:<br /><br />- Jenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on, both were entirely engrossed with each other, ready to risk anything for love...<br /><br />- Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny, until he sees her sitting, outside, on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny, all shaken, and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection: \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\\"<br /><br />- Oliver, sitting alone and lost to the world, uncertain and perplexed, unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind, a minute in his heart, a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes, smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life,' and this is our great gift, our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!<br /><br />The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once: \\"Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation.\\" And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.'

6305910340|4.0|More than the pressure of winning, real life child chess prodigy, Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), must guard himself from adult's expectations for success.  His father Fred (Joe Mantegna) makes most Little League parents look tame in comparison.  As a sportscaster he makes Josh feel ill-at-ease with the dimension and topic of his remarkable talent.  Fred finds Josh a determined but pushy and arrogant chess coach (Ben Kingsley).  One key scene is during a parent-teacher conference.  Josh's teacher is concerned that \\"the chess thing\\" is overtaking too much of Josh's time and interest.  To this Fred is pointed.  He accuses the teacher of belittling him.  It is ambiguous if the teacher wants normalcy, mediocrity, or sanity for Josh, but what is clear is that Fred will have none of it.  He pulls Josh out of his school and places him in a private school where he can take chess classes.  To the film's credit, we see some balance in the father.  Although he tells the teacher that Josh has an opportunity he never dreamed of having, he does talk to Josh about a friend who will be attending his new school. He also has some genuinely heart-to-heart talks--even if they are tainted with his own ambitions.  All the pressure to win hits the poor boy and the audience, for we can feel his pain.  Yet, there are refuges for Josh as well.  His mother, Bonnie (Joan Allen), genuinely puts his welfare first, and Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) his companion in the park, teaches Josh that his gift is meant to be enjoyed above all else.    After seeing this little gem, I couldn't help but think of the more recent movie 'Akeelah and the Bee'.  Both movies have child prodigies, a nerve-racking family life, and Laurence Fishburne in a key performance.  This film is likable for the story and the parallels between Josh the protagonist and his hero, Bobby Fischer, complete with interweaving clips of the famous chess champion.  William Macy gives a great early performance as a nervous competitive parent,trying to play it cool. 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' makes some touching moves.

0743270754|5.0|magnificent labor of love!  goodwin prepared an excellent background on the life and political thought processes of mr. lincoln.  she pulled together a plethora of facts from numerous credible original sources.  i walked away with a better appreciation of the boy, the man, his thinking, the political factors of the day, a touch of military history, a touch of cultural and social history.  goodwin, herself, is a genius, effectively weaving together such seemingly disconsonant aspects. i found this book so riveting that i read it every moment that i could spare.  i would ABSOLUTELY recommend this work to anyone with an interest in lincoln or political theory.  it is well worth the price, new.  i must confess that, she did such a splendid job of detailing aspects of this incredible man's life that, on several occasions, i found myself wanting, just this once, a different ending than the one i knew to be forthcoming.  i sometimes wished that ms. goodwin had offered more analyses of events beyond a rare phrasing that would send the reader off wondering of her own speculations ... i suppose that's left up to the thousands of other lincoln scholars ...         i look forward to reading her next works.

B000HCO840|1.0|This is the worst possible concept that I have encountered in all my years of following the X-Men.  I am so disgusted with the directors \\"vision\\" that I can not even embrace the few good aspects that did surface.  If the movie had been about topics that were not already defined I would not have been as disappointed but it USED the Pheonix theme but with a totally unacceptable change of story line. <br /> <br />Jean Grey became the Pheonix due to alien intervention and challenges.  SHE WAS NOT MENTALLY UNBALANCED DUE TO HER POWERS.  Also, killing off Xavier after only 3 movies only proves that the director had nothing in mind but making a name for himself because he sure didn't produce a product that X-Men fans can embrace. <br /> <br />I can only hope that, as with the Superman movies, the next X-Men movie will carry on as if this one was never made.

I've given copies of this book to many, many friends & will continue to do so.  This book deserves a wide audience!
