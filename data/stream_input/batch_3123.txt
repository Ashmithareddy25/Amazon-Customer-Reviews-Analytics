B008J8KBKY|2.0|This game needs to rotate 360 degrees on the Y-axis. It is too difficult to view the entire playing board.
B00EDPFJA4|3.0|First of off, let me tell you I am a fan of drake but out of all his album this one is not all that fun to listen to because its slow and boring. However he had a couple of songs that I enjoy the most such as: Hold on I'm going home, Too much, Furthest thing, come thru, own it, Wu-Tang forever and connect. Those to me seems to be the best songs on the album. The rest of the songs suck and sound like some died. I was listening to his album when it first came out on iTunes. On my way to work and I was so bored and tired of listening to the album I almost fell a sleep on the highway. I deleted all the songs that I dissed like and left like that. I'm so happy I didn't spend $9 to $15 dollars on the weakest Drake of the year. However in my opinion Drake last album called \\"Take Care\\" was my favorite of them all, because his lyrics was on point and the beats were banging until the album was over. I hope this review help a little bit but I can say overall I give this album a 3.2 rating. I hope Drake next project will be 10 times better than this because it sucked.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I was looking for an app I could use on my Kindle to stream from YouTube. This was not it. Horrible organization  and no way to move around it easily. Yuck!
B00080DIWE|4.0|This is a great product. The turntable works great and is a good height to get to the areas underneath for painting. The included clips are a welcome accessory. The are just the right tension and fit nicely in the slots on the turntable for that extra &#34;third hand&#34;. I suggest using some type of protective cover such as plastic wrap or newspaper on the surface of the turntable, or over time the slots of the clips will fill in with paint.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I am absolutely mesmerized by the language and descriptions in this book.  The characters have depth, the environments are interesting and well-described.  The author's descriptions of harrowing moments make me lose myself in the book, so EXACTLY what I love about reading.  Highly recommend this book!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|After waiting what seemed like an eternity, ARTPOP has finally arrived! I for one am not disappointed in the least. I was puzzled by one reviewer who said her voice is altered on every track? Did this guy listen to the same album I did? Sure, SOME vocals here and there have some effects on them, but 95% of the time it's her voice. That was one of my initial concerns-in this day and age where every pop &#34;star&#34; has to use auto tune to mask the fact that they can't sing, I was a little worried that Gaga might throw some in there too(even though we all know she can in fact sing her ass off)....much to my relief I was proven wrong. I really should've known better- she's one of the few who can sing and has a great voice, so why mask it with that crap. Just listen to Dope or Gypsy and you'll hear that amazing voice. The only song I skip is Jewels n' Drugs- just for the fact that I absolutely hate rap! I'm not going to go into any details about each track as it's all here in other reviews...so I'll end with saying that she really outdid herself with this one, and to hell with the trolls and haters!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I love this movie it made a lot of since, its a great movie to purchase for the family or for self.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Very entertaining.  Keeps you awake. Excellent acting. Really a good movie.  Would watch again.  Hope Sylvester will make more movies.
B001C0HK50|1.0|Don't purchase the album!  Every single song stops halfway through, never get to hear the entire song!  Very frustrasting as I love this band.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|In recommending this book to friends, I realized it sounds like a boring concept but the language is so beautiful and the character so unusual that I still find myself pushing it on anyone who will listen.  Loved this book and was sorry to see it end.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good read and brought back memories of when the orphan trains were used.  Something the younger generation needs to learn about those times.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|I was really excited to shoot with this film pack but after shooting one exposure of it, the battery in the pack stopped working and the remaining 7 exposures went to waste...
0446310786|5.0|Everyone should read this book! Beautifully written and classic. Breaking down barriers for years, if you read it in school once then you'll want to own it.
B00G91Z8AQ|4.0|I liked this movie.<br /><br />the most notable thing I have to say about it is that I was surprised at how much material came from other films.  Watching this movie reminded me of all three Matrix movies (the flying scenes, the fist fighting scenes, the Genesis chamber), War of the Worlds (the Kryptonian ships), Independence Day (The Kryptonian World Builder machine), and even Star Trek (the recent ones) with the lens flares.
B00F5PS5P2|5.0|Every time I think today's youth is lost, and that music will never be good again, a band like Chvrches comes along and restores my faith.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Well made game. Kids would love it, but keep an eye on the jewels, because one click in the wrong place takes two weeks to earn back
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|You can't go wrong with John Grisham. His stories have a nice balance to them, appropriate plot construction and character development. The fact that this one was a sequel is a nice touch.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me laughing so hard I truly enjoyed this one I feel it captured a man's pov perfectly.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Entertaining as Grisham always is, but nothing really new in the plot line.<br />As usual Grisham gives an inside view of lawyer tactics and injustice within the justice system.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent story line, action intense, and great affects. The movie keeps your attention and can be related in many aspects of life.
B00DJUPLY8|1.0|Garbage. plays horrible quality, back round noise. Just a complete disaster !. Spend the $5 bucks and go with ProPlayer from Blaston<br />By far the BEST music/video app for android I have ever had
006202406X|1.0|What a total disappointment.  I really enjoyed book one and book two was almost as good.  I had preordered Allegiant and was excitedly waiting for it's release.  To say this book is bad just doesn't capture how truly awful it is.  The writing is stunted by the multiple perspectives, while clearly necessary, it becomes increasingly wordy and problematic.  The plot makes very little sense.  No that isn't fair, the plot makes NO sense.  Characters you have come to know and love act in bizarre ways that are directly contrary to everything we know about them with little to no explanation.  The ending is not satisfying in the least and not just for Tris and Four.  The grand reveal of everything beyond the city falls flat.  I will not include spoilers in my reviews.  I will only say that the book was so bad I have lost all interest in going to see the movie.  Why invest more time with these characters knowing the complete nonsensical way the trilogy ends.  In conclusion: if you are a fan of the first 2 books please, please, save your time, money, and love for these characters and do not read this book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Great movie,the Tiger look real,story was great,actors great...made me cry....great...scenery awesome...I love animals!It will be a movie I watch once a month!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Love it & nothing more to say! Peter Jackson continues to make the stories I love into movies & giving us extended version brings them closer to the lit.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|This is a fun little game that can be played off line which is always a plus. There were no ads and it PLAYED with no problems on my kindle fire HD. It was worth a dollar.
B002B790YC|5.0|This movie is great!<br />It pulls you in from the beginning right to the very end.<br />Great music score as well!<br />A+++++
B006LR0XLM|5.0|OK according to the Amazon App store dropbox isn't compatible.  However if you go to the dropbox.com site and select mobile apps it shows Kindle Fire as one of the items and provides instructions.  Works great on my HDX
B000SL1Q2C|1.0|Because this was a gift...I did not ordered the Italian Edition,my friend put it in and it,would not play...said it was unauthorized in his area where he lived...its a great movie if it was the English version...Im Italian but do not speak it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoyed the plot,  the pace kept me intrigued - there were sluggish places but all in all,  I enjoyed it.  It ended abruptly which left me wondering if I missed something.
B00ENXBUR2|3.0|I'm not sure it was worth the extra money I paid for the collectors edition first of this is a limited edition numbered product but the production number is only labeled on the packaging not the tin or disc sleeve or the stand. And speaking of the stand it really not sturdy at all there are small magnets on the back of the stand that really barely hold the tin to the stand there is s small v-notched cradle at the bottom which was not glued well and fell off. The stand itself is two pieces that snap together but the fit is not good and the two pieces like to come apart very easily the tin itself is nice no complaints with it's construction its actually got a foam insert to hold the stand since you won't be using it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book is confusing with the change in narrators with each chapter which causes a disconnect with the characters. The ending was disappointing.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|I am a big fan of the series, I did like the book, and I read it more or less fast. But at times it was disappointing.<br />As for the things I did like:<br /><br />A) In my opinion, the Pendergast series works best in stories dealing with the macabre, as opposed too relying too much on action based narrative, and in that sense this book delivers.<br /><br />B) The exchanges between Doyle and Wilde are, quite simply delightful.<br /><br />C) Pendergast has a chance to display his ability to totally subdue pompous arrogant jerks in his usual fashion.<br /><br />D) This book interweaves not one, nor two, but three mysteries, in effective fashion.<br /><br />E) I like that continuity is respected. In one on other level, we are reminded of the fact Pendergast is still dealing with the ramifications of past events, and that other interesting characters inhabit this universe.<br /><br />F) We are gifted with a fake bonus Sherlock Holmes story, that was authentic enough, that really took me back.<br /><br />What I did not like:<br /><br />A) This is really disappointing, and in my opinion, this by itself costs the book one star. The resolution of the whole affair relies on the old fashion escape route of having one of the main characters acting like a complete idiot.<br /><br />B) I don't know if this is my own fault or not, but ever since reading Roger Ebert's principle of the unnecessary character (or however he used to call it), I have become more likely to guess who the mystery bad guy is. I guess that the authors could do a bit more of an effort to disguise those characters.<br /><br />C) And well, the book is short. I think the premise was strong enough that it deserved a more intricate story.<br /><br />All in all, fans should buy the book of course, but new readers should find some of his earlier stand alone efforts, too really appreciate what a good Pendergast novel is about.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A lot of lawyer procedures of course but liked the idea tied in with his first book.  Kept my interest of how it would end enjoyed
B00942Y35S|5.0|Just great, a goofy movie made as well as possible for that genre.<br />I ended up with wet eyes because I cared about the characters being so well portrayed.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|the classics must be preserved from the politically correct gestapo before they are removed from our book shelves.  This is how they talked in the south.  Today the filth and foul in books is our normal...what will it be in our children's future?
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I'm a James Bond fan. Daniel Craig has filled the role very nicely. Will miss Judi Dench as &#34;M&#34;. I enjoyed the action and the point that the things we do, put into place we do need to reap.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Andrea Boccelli never ceases to amaze me.  This collection is right up at the top.  His voice is incredible.  I can't find the words to describe it so I might as well stop here!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Wow, and when you thought that the Shining was over.... This has been captivating from the start. Have not quite finished it yet, but have found it very hard to put down!
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I would probably give this case at least a 4-star rating if it wasn't ALREADY USED.<br /><br />I just opened up the package and the clear side of it is cloudy and scratched up. This is obviously a used case that has been returned and they didn't check it at all.
0439023491|5.0|My 12 year old son enjoyed this entire series. I am next in line to read it based on his glowing review. It is not often I get details on a book he is reading.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book has an extremely riveting storyline, and it would be a whole lot easier to focus and concentrate on without it taking so painstakingly long for you to read it. But I must say that once you get about halfway, it takes only severe hunger or thirst for the book to be pried from your hands. Overall a good read.
030758836X|2.0|This book was ok. Maybe too predictable and long and drawn out and by the end I just didn't care or get into the characters...who are hardly likeable anyways. It's kind of disturbing. However, my friends really liked it! You might too?
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Read this awhile ago and decided to refresh my memory. R. A. Salvatore is so descriptive it's like I'm watching a movie.  I have read most of the forgotten realms books he has written and have yet to find one I wouldn't recommend
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Don't care for Christian Bale at all!  I can't stand his lisp!  Don't know how he has survived as an actor with his lisp! I bought this for Heath Ledger!  Amazing transformation as the Joker!
0439023513|5.0|Had to get this book for my 12 year old after he gave great reviews of the other two. You know it must be a good book when your son chooses the book over electronics. I will be reading it soon based on his enthusiasm.
031623480X|5.0|THis is the best book I have read in YEARS (non-fiction). I have gone gluten free after reading this. I suffer from chronic headaches and the examples in this book are very helpful. I have shared sections of this book with friends and family and most of them bought their own copy. Very solid scientific proof and solid advice for lots of different ailments.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very well done, exciting, tense, with a fantastic and cathartic ending.  Highly recommend it! don't miss out on this one!
B002LAM7PI|5.0|A great tale for kids to realize that the grass isn't always greener on the other side and parents even though they can be locked in their own worlds, they do truly love you.  Animation is great!  Wonderful parable to share with kids even though it's a bit sinister.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Captivating and disturbing view of a community of flawed, believable characters.  Not only did I hate the ending, but I hated the book to end!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read, hard to put down. I am excited for the movie to come out. I highly reccomend, must read.
B0009P42V4|5.0|Thank you I have always loved this movie since I was little and still to this day do thank you.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|i like the game its fun and keeps me wasting time. i dont like that u cant make gems in game only real cash.
0345479092|1.0|It is clear from reading this book and attempting to implement Tracey's E.A.S.Y method that this women has never been around an actually baby.  Her schedules don't work unless your baby always takes the same length of nap, same length of feeding, and never has any issues.  She never addresses how to deal with a baby who is fussy due to gas, ear infections, vaccinations, teething etc.  Instead she simply says that her plan is soooo easy and if your baby is not following it, then you are a failure.  Babies don't care about your schedule, they don't always do the same things in the same order for the same length of time....which is why this book is a waste of time and I wish I had never bought it!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It took it over 24 hours to show up in my apps library and that was after searching all over for it.  It's a rip off version of Bejeweled only slower. Probably ok for kids and it WAS free but I really don't understand why people keep inviting me to play.
B003B02PF4|5.0|Once again John Grisham delivers another action packed book<br />You can't put down!!!!  I would recommend this book to all my<br />Friend and enemies!!!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This was a great movie and I will watch again soon. A lot of work went into this movie and its worth watching.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game to kill some time graphics look decent good<br /> game all around one of the better hunting games for the kindle
B000ZLJOW4|3.0|Just &#34;ok&#34;. I expected more from such a great cast. Was sort of left feeling bored and disappointed. Good acting, but the story lacked direction and I felt like there was no real ending.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|I spent 3 seasons on the bike for Little 500 shortly following this movie's release.  Getting to know and meet many of the real life characters such as Bob Stohler of Bloomington Brands has really been a treat.  Plus cycling is a great sport and form of exercise.
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|Best superman movie I've seen. I've seen all superman movies. The man of steel it's the best movie so far!!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is awesome!  I needed 16 more work I really done like the word require ment 1 2 done :-)
B007MJ9LA2|2.0|Not what I was expecting.  It was hyped as being Santana returning to its roots.  Very little of it sounded like the old Santana that I loved and knew so well.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|*******SPOILERS*******<br /><br />Bad. Felt rushed and forced. I still don't understand exactly what they were fighting for...factions...no factions? I don't mind the deaths of the minor characters as I wasn't very attached to anyone in this book. After I heard what it was like inside Tobias' head heck they could have killed him too if they wanted. He was strong and sure of himself in the first books and in this one he got a huge shot of estrogen. &#34;Am I damaged? Does she like that other guy more than me?&#34; Blah blah. Made me hate him. Do you hear yourself?! You ARE damaged now you pansy!<br /><br />Double pointS of view was lame. Like everyone else said, they both were the exact same person, so I couldn't keep track of who was who.<br /><br />All the bad guys live and get decent lives and all the good guys might as well have jumped off that building together in the end instead of zip lining.<br /><br />Can't figure out if there was no sex scene or ten. That was weird.<br /><br />Now on to the big one. Tris is DEAD. Some magnificent pieces of literature feature a main character death. I don't mind them. To be completely honest I wish they killed more main characters because after 3-4 books of being in their head you really want to throw them a nice &#34;see you on the other side&#34; party. However it needs to be done right. The brother dying to save them for redemption written in a little different way would have been amazing. It was the only way he could have left his character on a good note.<br /><br />Tris stole that redemptive death from him, and gave us a dead main character for no reason. Great job tris, keep relying on those split second decisions. I also wasn't sure she actually was dead because just like the sex scenes it never really said it, I thought she was just laying on the ground hallucinating from blood loss. I still sort of don't believe it because this whole book doesn't match the first two, which makes me think it's not in fact the third book.... And there's another one coming out someday...that I would pay double for ;)<br /><br />We don't hate you Veronica, just fix it with a little alternate ending that picks up where the second book left off. Also end the movies with the good ending and not this one.book....

B00E0SX118|5.0|Loved this movie and so did my 6 yr old.  I would refer this movie to all my friends for their children
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you are tired of computer-generated animation, watch animes by Miyazaki like this one. I believe they use computers as well, but basic design is done by pencil & paper. What a craftsmanship.
B0000V6SOG|4.0|As a yearly &#34;Love Actually&#34; viewer of the movie, I found the CD to bring back images of the movie quite well.  One complaint...the song &#34;Jump&#34; (to which Hugh Grant dances in the movie) is done by a cover group and does not sound like the original.  I end up skipping it, which is too bad, because it is a good song.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for people of all ages. Me my wife and my 5 year old son l.ove playing it together
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|It is very adventurous and I really think you should write another one of the land of stories!thanks for making me, well, still believe in fairy tales.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Cool game. Lots of fun doing different hunts. Upgrading guns can be a challenge also. Look forward to next hunt.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|No Commercials - - - ALWAYS a BONUS ! ! !  Watching the &#34;Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1 without commercials made the show much more enjoyable for me.  The continuity was just &#34;there.&#34;  I saw Season 1, for the most part, when it ran on TV.  I did not initially appreciate Sarah (Lena Headey) because she was always worried.  Well, I have learned that her character has to be worried - she is trying to avoid an apocalypse. None-the-less, it wasn't until I genuinely appreciated her the 2nd time I saw Season 1 without commercials.  Season 1, John Connor (Thomas Dekker) was a boy.  As the young John Connor, I believed.  He was a great kid and knew he was meant for greater things and, I believed.  Cameron (Summer Glau) is amazing in anything she does.  Her dancing skill took her into the Terminator role with perfection.  She was a child in Fire Fly but as Cameron she is a female Terminator.  James Ellison was such a kick for me to see back on the Tube! I loved him (Richard T. Jones) in Judging Ammy as Bruce Van  Exel.  As James Ellison, he had the right stuff to match Cameron as well as Sarah.  He is just FUN to watch in this scifi series.  Garret Dillahunt as Cromartie was exciting but as John Henry, he was amazing.  The interaction between Ellison and John Henry was fabulous and the quality of their dialog was, again just FUN ! Sorry I blended Season 1 and Season 2 with Ellison and John Henry.  Season 1 and Season 2 are seamless with Amazon Prime.  We just joined again for the second time - I love Amazon Prime particularly when they throw in some freebees I didn't know about.  Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 1 - EXCELLENT ! ! ! I plan to wait 6-8 months and watch it all over again!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very quick read that packs a lot of detail and excitement.  I can't wait to read more about this world!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun we play it consistently. I wish I could move along faster. Love the idea of being able to ask for more lives.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I thought it was a fitting conclusion to the series. Cudoes to V Roth for giving us this brilliant story.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a short fat blade that you could use to pry open a car door.  Heavy, beefy, darn near indestructible.  Exactly what all the other reviews claim.  A lot of knife for the money. A great buy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|the chromecast is not what i was expecting.. i have a smart tv with all the apps that this lil thing has...and i have rokus in all my other rooms.. so no need for this thing i think im gonna sell it.. the delivery was great.. go it really quick..
0312430000|5.0|This was a very helpful book.  I am a shift supervisor and I use the tips in this book for my own check list.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Amazingly well written.  Haven't finished it yet, but I don't want to.....trying to make it last!  Four more words required.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|amazing knife for the money.  Built like a tank.  You would be hard pressed to do better at this price!  I like the sheath better than many of my other camping/utility knives.
0062014536|2.0|Hoped for another ending! All this time waiting and waiting for that disappointing ending...there were too many loose ends, that left me unsatisfied.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|I bought it as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He loves the Beatles and was happy with the album.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A thoroughly sinister psychological thriller about 2 very unlovely people. I thought it was very well written, very readable maybe a bit long.
B00ET47USI|3.0|It's okay, there is so much going on that the game eats up your battery. I like the game better on my computer.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|I chose to bring this book to my granddaughters school for my guest appearance as the Mystery Reader.  The class consisted of 1st, 2nd and 3rd graders - all of whom loved this book.  It is funny and engaging.  The kids took particular interest in the sections &#34;written&#34; by their favorite crayon colors and all seemed pleased by the resolution - the final picture in which all the colors were used in a way the had wanted.  I think the age range posted for this book (3 to 5) is too young.  There are a lot of words to each page - too much for a 3 year old but perfect for older kids.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game over megapolis, your cash build quicker and it's clearly instructed.  Down side it has you posting a lot
0812992792|4.0|Kind of a typical view of North Korea and North Korean culture, but an engaging and memorable read. Not sure if the point of view is fair. On one hand, who knows?--it's North Korea, after all. But on the other, it really does seem under-researched, at least to someone who lives in South Korea.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|9 months later and I am still extremely addicted! Don't start unless u mean to finish! Fun and entertaining. So easy to become obsessed.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story line and nice old fashioned mystery framing to round it out.  Not the best John Grisham story but still entertaining read.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|whats with the bad reviews i thought the movie was awesome could it have been better sure but was still best superman movie ive ever saw definitely better than the one and two stars people give it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love it couldn't wait to see the next episode. I will continue to watch as long as this series is avaliable
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel  Washington is one of the finest actors in movies today . I have seen all of his films and have never been disappointed. He flawlessly interprets and inhabits his characters. The scene with Goodman and Cheadle  before the trail is priceless. The use of The Rolling Stones  song &#34;Sympathy for the Devil &#34; was perfect. and I hope it will remain to be Goodmans theme song. I was wondering if  Goodman had to return Charlie Sheens shirt and sunglasses after the wrap party. The ending is gripping and sensational. This never happens in real life, Cheadle's character would have had a gun to his head.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I also like that it warns of cleaning items you may not want to clean. It saved me 1gb in no time. :-)
B007MDB71O|5.0|Love this movie!! The price was good and John Carter is just a good movie overall. Definitely recommended if you also like Prince of Persia although this one is a bit better.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm a very well-read person and have experienced numerous types of ending to series, but this is by far the worst. I understand Roth's explanation that &#34;it was always the plan,&#34; however, she stated that she wasn't thinking of her readers when she wrote the ending. How can you NOT think of your readers? We are the reason that your series even got this far. I get attached to my literary characters, so Tris' death was terrible to me. It left me feeling that the book was unfinished and depressing. There were so many different directions that Roth's could have gone to end the series in a shocking yet satisfying way so therefore I feel she had no excuse to end the series with such heartache. I respect Roth as an author and feel she did a great job on every aspect of every book, but she totally lost my support by choosing this ending to Allegiant.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Amateur biblical scholarship. Aslan is not a biblical scholar; he is a creative writing teacher. He has basically two theses; we can't know anything about the historical Jesus, and (2) he knows about the historical Jesus. The book contains a great deal of wild speculation presented as fact, or at least as the consensus of learned opinion. He presents no evidence that Jesus was a zealot; not surprising, as there isn't any. It is a theory, and one he does not support.<br /><br />If you want to explore the historical Jesus, there are a variety of perspectives and conclusions from knowledgeable and established scholars, past and present - you can read N T Wright, Marcus Borg, John Crossan, E. P. Sanders, Gunther Bornkamm, Raymond Brown, Bart Erhmann and Luke Timothy Johnson are all better places to start.<br /><br />Two stars, because I have read worse books and we have to preserve the integrity of the one star book.
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|This is a fun time waster. However I will be uninstalling it due to there being NO quit button. You are forced to force close this game to end it. Very important feature not to have. For this I docked 2 stars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Awesome! Love the story set in England! Stayed up past bed time more than once to see what was coming next!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I can't believe Veronica Roth did it but I'm glad. This is the most real part of the trilogy. It answers so many questions and leaves so many others unanswered. It's the most mature book as well. It makes you realize what it really takes to be a leader, to be good, to be different and to become a hero.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Ludicous. Laughable clap-trap. Worst acting by Channing Tatum ever and that is a new low. I laughed through the entire thing and not because of Jamie Fox.  It was just that it was sooooo bad it was funny. It may become the 'drinking movie' of the next decade where people will watch it and when somebody says something really stupid everybody has to take a shot.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Fun alien invasion series.  What you'd expect, interesting characters.  Interesting enough to make me want to keep watching the series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the Downton Abby characters and their story.  Don't watch season three until you have seen Season 1 & 2.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not so much into romance but this one knocked me out while I waited for Divergent's Allegiant (A true Shailene fan). The writer is invisible in this one, it's Hazel writing her story in her own words. All the characters become alive while you read this and it certainly makes me see cancer, living, dying and living while dying in a new way. Aren't we all dying someday anyway? Well Hazel and her story are not going to in my mind. Loved it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show, truly captivating. I can wait to check out next season. The writing is well done. I love Ron Pearlman, but the writing makes me hate Ron Pearlman ... That is how good it is. (I still like Ron Pearlman)
B00GHJ1S2M|3.0|Too artsy for me.  Where are the catchy tunes, GaGa?  1st Album was the best, and it's been all downhill from there.  And what's up with song with R. Kelly??! He's a piece of poop so you really messed up there.  Last time I spend my money on you.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Roth's two person narrative was executed terribly.  The plot-line was often boring until the ending.  The protagonist dies for no important reason and not out of necessity.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I love this album!!  &#34;I Can Bet&#34; is my favorite track, although &#34;Early Days&#34; brings tears to my eyes thinking of him and the lads in Liverpool. If you love Paul, you'll enjoy &#34;New.&#34;
B004K58GSO|5.0|I have always loved watching this film.  Good comedy and John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are great together.  Loved seeing James Caan in younger years.
B0090SI582|4.0|Great direction, amazing acting make &#34;The Wolverine&#34; a must watch. Hugh Jackman returns (thank god) in the iconic role of Wolverine with an epic story told by a gifted filmmaker (James Mangold). All in all the story, pace, and action were all great. Probably my only gripe are the visuals as they were a little off probably because of its low budget (120 Million, which isn't a lot for a big named blockbuster). I can honestly say I know why this film is getting a sequel, because it's good enough to have one! I am also glad that the director and actor who made this film great are coming back! Bring it!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love the time period. It's underrepresented in modern entertainment. As far as the plot, however, it's a stereotypical soap with far too much drama. I gave it 5 stars because I'm generous and because of the lavish period representation.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|This is the perfect product to keep my kindle paperwhite from being scratched.  Also, you can't beat it for the price.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This third book of the Divergent series was nothing like I expected, but was way better than I could have ever dreamed. The plot is so much different than the first two books, but in a refreshing way. It was a great, yet unexpected ending took the series.
B00G32OER4|2.0|Production values were good.  The film did not have a cheap look,  The acting was also adequate.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because I was extremely bored.  I like films with a lot of action and this film is mostly talk.  If you like &#34;Paranormal&#34; you would like this movie.
B004G600A4|5.0|My 3 year daughter and I both love this movie. It's fun and funny. Repunzel is adorable, strong, and likable. It was a little hard to explain to my, then, 2 year old how the witch was just pretending to be her mommy and her real mommy was the queen. She is 3 now and gets it, but was a little confused at first, although she still enjoyed it. She asks for it every day.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book gives insight to all of those individuals who are &#34;different&#34; and the struggles that they have to endure.  Excellent for both teenagers and adults.  It is important to educate others to understand from the perspective of those who live with their challenges.
B009U9S6FI|1.0|Very disappointed. Hyped as being a must read, I found this book to be not. Poorly written and disorganized, I couldn't wait to get to the end. The book poses many psychological questions without any insight on answers.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was compelling, heart warming and tragic.  It was hard to believe this was the authors first novel.  Well done, well organized and orchestrated based on the visions of the author who stayed true to the characters.  Looking forward to a sequel.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love this book and its just as well written as his others!!!  Another awesome job.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good book
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Loved this book. Great story about how a cat can make a deep impact on a person's life and the special bond that can be created.  Also how amazing, funny and smart cats can be.  The story was fun and easy to read.  I really enjoyed it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE it and want more!!  Save a whole weekend to watch all at once!<br /><br />Excellent acting and set up, well done Masterpiece!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Very fast drive but it had noise issues and made loud clicking noises when seeking or writing data.  I returned it and bought the 32meg version and had better experience.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|Our kids love it.  Because there are no super scary villains or overly-intense scenes, our 3 year old can watch it. Afterwards, we can discuss the themes of bad attitudes and the effects of lying.
B0019IB0II|3.0|Thought it was going to be fabulous but was just ok. Actually did not even finish it. Found it moved a bit slow and had too many technical parts.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I learned after I bout this I was trying to pull it up and then it was rented to me after I bought it..lol.. I will pay closer attention on the movie stuff.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|It is a fun and interesting tool and game rolled into one. It presents the difficulties of launch a rocket into space.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|The effects were great, as I expected.  The storyline was a cheat.  After the previous Star Trek movie wiped the Star Trek universe clean of its past (allowing just about anything to happen since the time line and history had been changed), the writers cheated and took a line straight from the past with a younger Kahn, even to the point of creating a Kirk/Spock radiation moment with the roles reversed.  IT WAS A LAZY EFFORT.  Should another Star Trek movie be made, I certainly hope more creativity is evident.
B001BFFTO0|5.0|I've had these for about a month now. They are my very first pair of leather boots ever and I love them. I wanted one boot that I could wear for winter, hiking, and just because, and these fit the bill. They look really good and have held up well through several hikes of about five or six miles each. A couple of the hikes the weather was pretty wet and no moisture got in. Of course, the tongue is loose, so I'm sure stepping in a deep puddle or hanging out in a constant downpour will allow some water in. They are also quite comfortable. I even wore them for about 19 hours straight walking all over Munich, Germany. My feet were sore, of course, but not as sore as they've been after a day in my usual low-profile trainers.<br /><br />The sizing, like everyone else says, is pretty large. I wear an eleven normally, but I went with a 10.5. Everyone said to go a size down, but my foot is a bit wide, so I thought I'd see how half a size went. Turns out I probably could have done with a size down, and maybe even a size and a half if I wanted a snug fit. But these were partly meant for hiking and for hiking you want your boots to fit just a bit large so you have plenty of toe room, so I've decided to stay with the 10.5, though if/when I buy another pair I might go down to 10.<br /><br />I got them in burnished brown, which ended up being a dark reddish brown, which I actually prefer.<br /><br />They were pretty much broken in and ready to wear right away, but have actually broken in even more. The leather is supple and comfortable. I've read some reviews saying that the sole wears out quickly, but that they would be happy to re-sole them. I haven't noticed any such wear yet, but if the boots last as long as I imagine they will, I'll be happy to re-sole them whenever. And I've never re-soled ANYTHING.<br /><br />TL;DR, If you're looking for a good boot for light hikes that can also be worn on a night out on the town, look no further. Just go a size down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent! The best season yet! I have loved Downton Abbey since the beginning and it just keeps getting better! Can't wait for next season!
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I hated this book.  Depressing as hell!  Could not feel any real sympathy for the main character.  And the plot was dreadful.  I LOVED Tartt's &#34;The Secret History.&#34;
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I am sad to report that the last book in this most intriguing series seems to have lost its way... the first two books were amazing and the third just wanders around with no excitement or real engagement for the reader. If I didn't love the first two, I would not have even tried to finish Allegiant...
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|It is a very captivating and nerve wrecking story. It is very informative and even a little shocking. The author has an annoying habit of referencing himself and tossing in irrelevant facts, like the how the royalties from the book sales were split...
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Takes concentration and patience. Given as a gift to a youth who appreciates that no batteries, charger or electrical gadgets required to play!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Lorde's breathy vocals and catchy tunes aren't annoying when they get stuck in your head. This EP is a lot of fun to listen to. Sort of reminiscent of Edie Brickell's voice with more pop and less stoner music to accompany it.
0307476073|4.0|In depth detail of an amazing walk alone on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Loved reading how Cheryl Strayed handled the different situations that accosted her along the way.  Very interesting.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This movie is wonderful. The acting and directing is superb. As much as it seems a little old fashioned and corny, it makes up for this in multiple ways with a story that fills you with imagination and hope. I cannot say enough good things.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Fascinating intricate and stylish novel. It takes a while to get into the old fashioned style but once you do its fantastic! Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device took a bit longer to connect and figure out than stated but after you get it going it is sooo neat!! l
B00BD99JMW|4.0|People were way too hard on this novel.  It's like on Facebook when someone says, &#34;Rough Day- I could use a friend and a cup of coffee.&#34; You want to click &#34;Like&#34; because you hear them and you want to give them your acknowledgement but yet you feel bad that they had a rough day. . .I give this book 4 stars not because I &#34;liked&#34; what happened in the story but because the author made me feel deeply for the characters.  I agree with some people that the different POV's from chapter to chapter got confusing sometimes and I would have to look back to see if it was Tris or Tobias and I agree that maybe she could have made the voices more specific to the character. . .and it felt that Tobias was weaker in this book but he had a lot going on in Allegiant with his parents and losing his identity in the factions so I bought that he was struggling with a lot in the last book that made him a little different. . .some people just felt it was not the Tobias they loved. When they first went to the outside, there was a lot of information layed out that could have been better shown but I think the author was showing us as readers how overwhelmed the characters too must have been getting told this information . . .Overall, this book was good. . .incredibly sad, but good.  I sobbed.  It can't be all that bad if it makes you so upset.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I enjoy it! Very fun for all ages. It's a pretty cool addition to the Angry Birds family of games.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|So refreshing and honest. It's been a long time since I've read a book that has touched me this much. These teenagers face a lot, which is a good reminder for all of us that those we come into contact with might be facing unseen challenges and deserve kindness and compassion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game and gets more difficult as you advance, but don't like the delays caused by the loss of lives.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Very good story about Bob Marley the man and the artist.  This guy is one of the most interesting people in the world.  He put Jamaica on the map.  He should be viewed in a more positive manner.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is entertaining and fun. However, I've tried to buy tokens and they don't ever appear. I liked the game originally.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|So much more than the media portrays.  After reading a number of articles about this book, I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I was happily surprised.  Fantastic, well-researched information and insight presented in an easy to read format with engaging anecdotes.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A book that sucks you in, draws you close to it's characters and plots and leaves you wanting more! Layer upon layer of intrigue and enthrall
B003G4W49C|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. I am so glad I did. How have I missed reading it all these years?  It is a fabulous book.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and the world they live in seems real.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Best book of the whole series. It's very difficult to put down. I Can't wait to read the whole series!
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|This CD is astonishingly bad.  I bought it and want my money back.  What I SHOULD have done was go to Youtube first and listen to the songs listed there first.  If you have any doubt about my words, go there and listen to VENUS.  Utter doo-doo and it is one of the better songs on the CD.  What happened to Gaga?  She had so much promise only a few years ago, at least it seemed that way.  But this CD is just a legal way to pick your pocket.  GaGa---if you are reading this---would you give me my money back????
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The story is ok but ended totally wrong. I wouldn't have read it if I knew how it was going to end.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Spoilers seem to abound in the reviews for book three. How could they not? This is a polarizing book. I thought, after getting over the initial feeling of being punched in the gut, that the ending was perfect. Spoilers below, read on at your own risk.<br /><br />I thought the ending fit the series, and the characters. Tris got beat to a pulp by Peter in book one, mostly because in real life that is exactly how you would expect that kind of fight to go down. She is also at least partly responsible for Al committing suicide. Some may prefer more black and white stories, that wrap up with the good guys on top, and the bad guys dead or incarcerated, but the Divergent trilogy screamed grey throughout. Very few characters truly fit into &#34;good&#34; or &#34;evil&#34; buckets, most seemed to fall somewhere in between. You might not like how things turned out, and might hate the author for it, but the ending does fit, probably much better than the alternative ending that we all wished for. And I understand the haters. My heart is with you, but my head knows better. Guess that clarifies which faction I'd end up in.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very good and it was one of my favorite so far.<br />When the next book comes out I going to get.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I have had these about a week now and they sound pretty good, and my friends say I sound good as well (compared to a webcam mic hah). The sound lacks a little in the bass department, but that doesn't bother me. There are 2 complaints though:<br /><br />1) Having a big head makes these cans really tight on my head. I left them expanded on my speakers over night and that helped a lot, so they might get more loose after some time gaming.<br /><br />2) The wire coming out of the right side makes this really annoying squeaking noise, not a huge deal but something I have noticed. Some glue fixes it pretty easily.
B00BU18U82|3.0|The game would be fun if I knew what I was doing. For a non farmer it would be nice for a lot more instructions. Maybe a tutorial in the beginning. Its a hard game to play.
B00499DRJO|5.0|I tried this and it gives me a wonderful feeling  of being secure and loved by the Creator of all that is, good job Vianna Stibal<br />Thank-you<br /><br />Marco
B00422LESO|2.0|Disappointed in Hale's writting. She tried to be to 'sexy'. Loved her previous books (Princess Academy, etc.) because they were a great, clean read. Put it down when the main character 'made out' with the gardener after barely learning his name. Please. Let there be more substance to a book, and one that I'd love to pass on to my girls.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|Pretty mediocre. Kind of addictive at first. Then just meh. Check it out. Everyones opinion is different. Im rating this for some extra crowns. Apparently it takes twenty words to describe a game such as this. Im not to good at coming up with sweet descriptive language to elaborate on how i feel about something. Just ask the girl friend about that one. Haha. Anyway this should be twenty words. If youve read this untill now... damn you must be bored. Lol
B00138EVDK|5.0|The &#34;bonus&#34; live tracks are superfluous - track for track, &#34;Leftoverture&#34; is probably Kansas' strongest album. The studio tracks flow seamlessly, and the original mix holds up quite nicely, in much the same way as the original release of The Who's &#34;Who's Next.&#34; If you could only choose one Kansas LP for your desert island collection, &#34;Leftoverture&#34; may be your strongest choice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is always fun!  addictive ... lol  I used to say that I would never play Facebook games.  OHHH Woe is me~
B00CL68BK2|4.0|In many ways this is the most realistic portrayal or mental illness I have seen in a movie.  That said, it is very much a well done fairy tale.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|JG never fails to take us on a legal journey.  The caracters are wonderful and the story spell binding.<br />It took me one day to read it, couldn't put it down.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A drama that pulls no punches in showing a man deep in the depths of alcoholism and drug addiction, yet is able to function.  Fate delivers a chance to change, but it has a couple of twists along the way.
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|I love Panic at the Disco, and I fell in love with to weird to live and too rare to die! But when I got it the case was broken.
B000JML90Y|3.0|It is very academic and a bit disjointed and in some ways rather dated.  Style is not smooth and the fact you cannot turn pages for reference makes Kindle reading frustrating.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved the book, real page turner. Liked how he pulled it all together in the end. Grisham great story teller.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|The kids love it!! Us too:) It is a great movie for kids that love planes. It was a must have for us.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant wasn't a page turner. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't as good as the other 2 in the series.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have just started reading this book but..........Philippa Gregory is such a great writer of this era that I will rate it now and know that it will have this rating from me when I finish it.  Do read all her other tutor books.
0316010669|3.0|After reading the first few chapters, it doesn't feel like it's saying much. Sometimes using natural reactions work sometimes it doesn't. It feels like it's leaving it up to the reader to determine when it is appropriate to use your &#34;gut&#34; and when to stop and think about an issue. Not a bad read, just not as great as I thought it would be.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book as much as I do because it's a strange storyline, not what I would normally choose. I'm into it now and I find myself thinking about the characters as I go about my day. For a week or two, I let the Audible narrator read aloud while I quilted, and I love that Kindle has gone in this direction. The computer voice was a good feature, but it detracted from being totally immersed in a book.
B00EO10M54|4.0|I love Miley Cyrus as musician. Her music is totally groovy man. But as a person, I cannot stand her. She is gorgeous, yes. But her attitude, I absolutely can't stand it. It's like she loves people to hate her so she can just pull out a joint, smoke it and say, &#34;I DON'T GIVE A F*** WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ME&#34; [and then proceeds to stick out her tongue] but this album is great!
B000Q79HTC|5.0|The GREATEST Matt Damon movie, and it only got better with Supremacy and Ultimatum. And having it in a digital form where you may access it from anywhere on any device makes it even better.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Writing style is difficult to follow.  Wrapped up the story in a convoluted, contrived way considering the promising start of the series.  Still love the characters, just disappointing conclusion.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Not as scary as the previews made it seem. The fact that it was a true story made more interesting.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I will admit that my eyesight is not what it used to be, but I swear that not all of the items are always there before I use tools to find them.  If I keep having the same problems I will probably uninstall the game rather than keep getting more frustrated.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|The 3D on this movie holds up against any home movie I have watched 3D on.  I have watched my fair share of movies in 3D.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|I had great hopes, but it was a fairly predictable Revenge of the Nerds remake. (Maybe I am being too harsh because I just watched The Internship, which also is a Revenge of the Nerds plot line.)  My kids were not as enthralled with this as they were with Monsters, Inc.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a super fun game were you can build what ever you want you can try and build and survive or  you can just create what ever you want
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|loved this game a really fun hunting game that I enjoy and I recommend. I would prefer this game to anyone who likes hunting games.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was absolutely gripping from the beginning to the very end. It was heart wrenching and true to life; showing the beauty of love and the horror of loss. It was a completely different view of World War Two Germany and I will recommend it to anyone I cross.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|First book I read by Grisham wasTIME TO KILL. The read did not fail me.the sequel is just as good or better..... e arthly and southern. Life in the South!
B0078XHAB4|5.0|So sweet. Full of hope and a lovely view of the afterlife. After losing my Mom I find myself hoping Daniela knows something I don't. It was a predictable book but still worth it.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This is an awesome movie!! Definitely a must watch when you get the chance. Robert Disney Jr was born to play Tony Stark.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If not Grisham's best then it was right up near the top.  Very interesting reading.  Would never have guessed the end ahead of finishing it.
B008J8KBKY|1.0|Did not like it much at times it can be difficult to see where the balls are, I would not recommend it for someone that does not want to keep moving the board around to get a better view.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This delightful favorite is actually enhanced by the skillful 3-D rendering. It gives a new edge to a very delightful film.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Awesome religious movie that was actually done well. It does not come across as cheaply made with poor acting like most.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Great film lovingly and artfully depicting the life and culture of a very successful Sushi maker and restauranteur, his rise from a very difficult childhood to an award-winning chef who is greatly loved and admired by family and friends.  The very last moment really touched my heart.  Worth watching.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another Excellent Read!  John Grisham maintained his reputation for enjoyable reading with this book.  Characters were interesting and colorful.  Great book.
B004WE01YA|5.0|What a beautiful and skillful adaptation. The 3-D experience is wonderful. This landmark film that set new standards in animation is even more fascinating in this 3-D presentation.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Language and nudity made it difficult to watch at first but acting was good and the premise of the story was redeeming.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I recommend it for Potterheads, girls that don't fit in, and anyone who would prefer to lose themselves in the fantasy world of a book rather than enter the real world.<br /><br />Cath is a girl whose twin, Wren, wants to ditch her freshmen year of college to find new friends. Her stable boyfriend Abel goes off to a different college and promptly finds a new girlfriend. Her roommate is caustic and has an annoying boyfriend who is always hanging around. She meets a guy in her fiction writing class who only wants to use her for her writing abilities. Then, she has to worry about her bi-polar father and deal with a mother who walked out on her when she was eight.<br /><br />She would prefer to lose herself in her fanfiction world, where she has thousands of adoring fans who hang on her every word. She must decide whether to remain a recluse or take a chance on something other than fanfiction.<br /><br />The dialogue was superb and the characters believable and likable. The book is left kind of open ended. I hope there may be a sequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So many games to chose from! I like how some are fairly easy and some are difficult. I like how if your really horrible at the game you still get some reward. No complains, can't wait to try the the HD. OXOXO
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 4 year old grand daughter thinks it's fun and funny so I guess I have to love it as well
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The thing is, it's horridly addictive. And as a druggie friend of mine once said, &#34;It ain't a drug problem, it's a SUPPLY problem.&#34; This is that; you get hooked into it, you know... I mean you KNOW you can do it with just ONE MORE TRY!<br /><br />And you get the &#34;17:30 till next life&#34; screen.<br /><br />I've gone through two tablets and a phone bashing things in frustration.<br /><br />But the game is on both, my new phone, and my latest tablet. :-)
1476727651|5.0|Doctor Sleep<br />by Stephen King<br />Scribner<br />2013<br />528 pages<br /><br />Spooky, scary and creepily grotesque doesn't begin to describe the terror of Doctor Sleep. Somewhere out there on America's highways and byways, you might see a convoy of Winnebagos driven by baby boomers and elderly retirees. You may not think anything of it, unless you've entered the terrifying world of Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />Dan Torrence (the child in The Shining) is now all grown up. Having survived the nightmare that was the Overlook, Dan has spent years lying to himself and relying on the bottle for solace. He finally turns to AA for help, and the shining is quiet for a little while. He is still in touch with the Overlook's  cook Dick Hallorann who has helped him understand the shining and his powers since childhood. When Dan is summoned by a young girl named Abra, he turns to Dick again for help.<br /><br />Abra has the shining, too, and it's strong. That's what attracts Rose and her group of life-sucking vampires who feed off the shining from children. The True Knot travels from campground to campground feeding off the shining of tragedies. When 9/11 happened, they fed well off the steam of the dying. Since then, their canisters of saved &#34;steam&#34; is dwindling, and Rose is getting nervous. What will happen to her band of paranormal gypsies if there is no more steam? She will lose her power and die. Rose can't let that happen. She feels a strong presence somewhere on the east coast and sends her scouts out to search for this young  beacon of hope.<br /><br />Dan and Abra are connected, and she reaches out to Dan though messages on a chalkboard and later, she is able to connect telepathically. Sometimes Abra feels someone else besides Dan is in her head and she is afraid. Dan teachers her how to set traps and scare to intruder off, but Rose is powerful. Abra has a vision of a young boy she calls &#34;baseball boy,&#34; and she knows he is somehow the key to destroying the True Knot.<br /><br />As the True Knot moves closer to Abra, Dan and Dick hatch a plan to save her and unravel the True Knot (yes, pun intended) and destroy them. It will take all three of them...and then some...to face the demons and win. Like The Stand, Doctor Sleep is the ultimate good versus evil battle.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is King at his masterful best; no one can build suspenseful excitement and fearful anticipation like King. He even takes a playful jab at fellow horror genre writer Dean Koontz--just for grins.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for anyone who loves a great story and every Stephen King fan grade 9 and up.

B0098XY5VK|5.0|I love this game,  but need a full version. Board with the same levels. Would like to see more soon.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|hate it, it's no fun and the coins don't accumulate fast enough to keep my interest, slow slow slow slow
B00G4I0DNG|4.0|Just because humans can capture something wild and put it in captivity doesn't mean they should. This movie shows how true that is.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent story loved his writing as usual gave me food for thought he is a gifted writer can't wait till next book
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I love it  it is so well written that I felt like I was part of the story and knew the characters.  It was very hard to put it down. I have ready recommended it to  my friends
B000J1AGQI|5.0|This movie is tough to watch, because it's horrible. No, not the quality of the picture, but because of how real it makes war feel.<br /><br />War is a terrible tragedy, and what this film does is show you what happens when people in armchairs decide they want to fight. They send the boys to go play war and then wonder why they feel so sad when they have to write letters to all of their family members.<br /><br />This movie does not create any heroes, nor does it create any villains. Just like in real life. We may disagree with the views and opinions of another culture. But when they lay their guns down to rest and go home. They too are returning to wives, children, and families. And you see that in this film. You see who the Vietnamese soldiers care about, and you see who the American soldiers care about, and the films basically makes the two sides appear to be as one. Unfortunately, one side has to lose and there are many, many gruesome deaths in this movie.<br /><br />What this movie does well, in my opinion, is make you care about the characters. You care about what happens to these boys and their wives. You ask yourself \\"was the war really necessary?\\" when the battles get gruesome, you wonder how you would react if YOU were to be called to duty. At least I do, and it's heartbreaking. I've never served, but this movie makes me imagine what it could be like. And then after watching this movie you realize... this was just one battle. When it's time for war, these battles happen again and again doing its damndest to kill anyone you may care about.<br /><br />It also shows you the shame and devastating sadness, of the vietnam vets coming home and having no one to wait for them. No one to hug them and call them heroes.<br /><br />It's a sad movie, but it's well done and well worth your time to watch it. It won't be easy, but it will make you appreciate the sacrifices the real soldiers have made, so that you could watch this movie from the comfort of your home.
B009C7JS14|2.0|not the info I expect to see and it is harder to use.  Do not like all the pop-ups that show
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|CAN LEARN  AT YOUR OWN PACE HAS A FEW KINKS BUT OVERALL LOVE IT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP AND LOVE THE SET UP
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Beautiful and very relaxing music to listen to.  He is one of my favor singer.  I listen to him at home in the car and I have his music on my tablet to listen to when we travel.
B007SGM084|5.0|Simply the best Love Story ever written. The Romance between Christian & Anastasia was so real<br />you felt as if you knew these two people. Everything between was a first. I could not put<br />book down. I have now read it 25 times.E L James heart was in the writing of this Novel. It's as if the<br />characters are real.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a lot of fun to play.  I am glad you don't have to be connected to Face Book.  It just is a good game and keeps the mind busy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|EXCELLENT READ IN JOHN GRISHAM FORM..NEVER FAILS TO DISAPPOINT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NEVER FOLLOWED JOHN. BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REALLY GOES ON
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What s terrific book.  Filled with characters and layers of content. Another movie and winner! I anxiously wait for your new work
B00821OX98|2.0|Boring Series, slow action subpar acting and a drag....Did not get through the pilot and can not think of anything else to say.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is so awesome! I first ordered one after hearing about it from a friend and how much they loved it. After receiving mine I order another for my bedroom TV. And now I'm getting another for my parents for Christmas. Great buy!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The entire series is riviting and provacative. The final book concludes in an unexpected and emotional twist of fate. The author provides insights into not only what makes us brave, but the very nature of humanity and ultimately that we have more in common than is readily apparent. The characters look into what makes us who we are and aspire with difficulty to overcome. A fantastic work of fiction!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is does a tremendous job of character development and makes the story come alive. He has the ability to get you emotionally involved in what's happening with plenty of suspense, intrigue and mystery played out by a mix of people that become real in the mind of the reader. Highly recommended!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|One of our favorite &#34;Cult&#34; movies!  Great writing and funny plot...what a great way to kill a few hours when the only thing you want to do is veg out!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Seemed like a copy cat of many other movies.  Thats it, I don't need to add anything more.  This is ridiculous that I have to mandatorally add so many words......
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was a great book. I love how everything gets wrapped up in the end. I would have liked to see a few changes to the ending so that's why I gave only four stars. The rest of the book was a real page turner.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|If you get it will get boring after while  a why you get tried of it you will see just get the game if you want to
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Fun Movie, enjoyed watching it, good plot and fine acting. Suggest it for anyone looking for an interesting few hours vegging in front of your TV.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this book. I have read it several times and it keeps getting better. I can't wait for the third one to be released.
B009C7JS14|3.0|I like to be able to see the 10-day outlook, and from what I could tell this app didn't have it like the Weather Channel does.Basically gave me the temperature over an 8(?) hr period, but not a lot of other &#34;usable&#34; info.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a very effective sharpener for use in the field. I can carry it in my pocket, and use it quickly.  One problem: I lost it. Will need to buy a replacement.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is a tremendous read from a very reliable source who acquired this knowledge through real world practice and experience. This is a very fun and thorough instructive read with plenty of exciting anecdotes from Joe's work in the FBI over the years applying the knowledge that he has put into this book.
B002BVZ2GI|3.0|The movie was alright, but it's downright shameful that you can't watch HD content on PC. If we would have known this, we never would have bought the HD version. Yeah, I know more and more people have Xbox or other content consuming devices compatible with Amazon Video, but come one, really? No HD on PC?
B009NY43NY|1.0|One of the worst endings to a series that I've ever read. It felt like a mish-mash of minor character appearances, and like someone else said, characters behaving out-of-character and a slapped together happily-ever-after kind of ending.<br /><br />What a downer. I hope the series continues to take a different path.<br /><br />This book did not do justice to any of the characters we've come to know and love.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|The movie is great . Love the characters and actions but dislike how the show ended. Over its one of the best.
0385341008|5.0|One of my favorite books,  I bought it again for a book club suggestion.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK RECENTLY A PART OF THE GLUTEN SUMMIT SERIES.  ONLY PROBLEM  WAS THE MEALS ARE AWESOME HOWEVER NO DIET BOOK INCLUDING THIS ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT  SINGLE PERSON LIVING ALONE.  ALLOT TO BUY AND USED FOR ONE MEAL UNLESS YOU EAT  THE SAME THING DAILY ., YOU END UP WITH $$ YOU ARE TOSSING
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|I loved the action and plot and I loved the interaction between characters. Plenty of blowing up and plenty of revenge.
B00EV6T6DQ|3.0|...considered, concise, and a conflagration of art, exceeding its grasp...a lovely light of feelings: love, loyalty, friendship, loss, longing, satisfaction
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was as good as A Time to Kill! I hope it is made into a movie with the original cast!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved playing Castleville on Facebook. I am glad to be able to play it on my kindle fire. The graphics are well done and the game is very addicting.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Another amazing tool from Google to connect my computer and my phone via Chromecast and bluetooth. Now the world is truly at my fingertips and under my control! Thanks Google. What a value!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This was a compelling movie on alcohol abuse and responsibility to society. A must see movie, and I recommend seeing it.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|This is an old Truman Capote novel.  Actually the first I have read although I know of the others.  In simple terms this guy is a writer. His style is his own and he brings his characters to life with small but intimate details.  Put this on your list.  I got a bargain in my download plus this is a great addition to your &#34;library&#34; if you haven't already read it........
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good tale  that took some unexpected turns and tidied up in the best way that it could have.<br />Surprisingly compassionate.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent plot stream with plenty of twists and turns supported by an excellent cast that helps you &#34;believe&#34; that they really are part of the story. It is a great examination of human nature.
0756666937|5.0|This book has every Lego up to its published date.  Our 7 year-old son loves reading it.  It is something worth buying after renewing often at the library!
B008VO3PA4|1.0|I expected something akin to the &#34;Sad Cat Diaries&#34; and all I got was the sad, which is the only way to describe this. Too bad.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|it is so easy to use. I used it to order a product the other day and it was just like using the full amazon shopping experience. felt like I was on my laptop and not on a cell phone
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger games:  prescient story.  Looking for a stronger lead character.  I think the guy back home would have been more innovative.  But not as sensitive.
B00881VLCE|4.0|magic jigwaw puzzles<br />I love puzzles - these puzzles are great to do when I dont have a lot of tlime to work on a big 750-100 piece. the pictures are just beautiful
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|This watch isn’t for everyone.  What I mean by this is if you have a small wrist this thing will look ridiculous on you.  To give you some background, I’m 6’3’’ broad shouldered pretty big guy.  The watch looks good on my wrist.  My roommate who’s about 5’8’’ the watch looked ridiculous on him, it was way to big for his wrist.<br /><br />This is my first white-faced watch and I have fallen in love with it  I wear it almost every day.  The band is cloth and others have complained about it, but I like it.  I have gotten more complements wearing this watch then when I wear a Rolex that was passed down to me by my father.<br /><br />Its nice enough to wear everyday at work and out at night.  I would highly suggest this watch to anyone that wants something that’s going to turn heads and not empty your pocket at the same time.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|A classic! Jim Carey and Cameron Diaz are wonderful in The Mask. This movie is perfect for loads of giggles.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant feels like it's pulling in two directions. On the one hand, Roth is introducing a lot of new things to the series: new characters, new locations, and even a new format as she introduces an additional first person narrator for many of the chapters. On the other hand, the books feels like it's desperately trying to tie up all of the loose ends and plot threads introduced earlier in the series. The result is a book that tries to do too much and, thus, falls short in many areas. Plot threads and questions opened in earlier books are awkwardly explained away as if Roth was tired of dealing with them. It still has the characters and conflicts and interesting world and Roth is still a talented writer, but this feels a little like a pie that should have been put back in the oven for another half an hour.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Wish it would rotate like it did before they add ADs. Wish the ADs didn't take up so much space.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story was an easy read but full of surprises. It was very well written as it dove into the psychological aspects of each character, as their lives and backgrounds were uncovered it lead to a very interesting conclusion. Everything was clearly explained leaving the reader feeling like the story was complete when finished, all the lose ends tied up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another fantastic novel by Gresham.  A joy to read. Exciting, innovative, and fascinating manner of writing that captures emotion and thought simultaneously. This book is very, very hard to put down...before you reach the end. Buy it and enjoy it and pass it along to others.
B00EUS9IBU|4.0|The album is great. There are a couple of songs that I don't care for and seem lazily written but I love the overall album.
B003O86FMW|1.0|gotta read the third one. It was better than the first. It is my ultimate favorite book. You have to read one first though.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Refreshingly different from the other shows out.  Keeps you engaged and nostalgic.  Its fun to compare the differences of this transitional period in history to our current state, how it shaped and molded us and how human nature is still the same.
B0048EANOM|5.0|A great buy! When I got this it wasnt availible in the UK. An awesome film and one in my top 20 best of all time. Features are good!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i loved the book i would remanded it to people who like action and love stories, great time reading it
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is a must read for anybody who is seeking a deeper knowledge of cancer, cancer research, and cancer treatment.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant was an amazing story that depicts life while telling a ficticious story.  It was heartfelt and exciting.  I would absolutely recommend the entire trilogy as a whole.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Better than the UK edition! More special Features!!!! Great film! Would reccomend you buy this instead of the UK edition due to the additional features.
0316322407|5.0|insperational!! she is a hero to the whole world!! ordered this for my daughter & daughter in law!! they like it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|ANOTHER COMPELLING NOVEL BY GRISHAM<br /><br />I loved the book and could not put it down.  He's a great story teller..
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Every episode was filled with suspense and kept my interest.  I watched the season on my iPad and couldn't get through the episodes fast enough.  So  looking forward to a new season
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It is a fun game to kill time, but one thing that bothers me is how easy it is to find the animals
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|I started to play the game for review and was warming up to it, but wanted to see what the game options are. As soon as I touched the menu/options button, the screen popped up, but then not only did the game stop responding, but it also completely locked up my device. I then hard reset it, tried again to see if it was a fluke, only to have my tablet lock up tight again.<br /><br />Am uninstalling this because it doesn't even matter if the app is good or not if it will not behave. One star to get the dev's attention and if they fix this issue,  I will then convert the review into a review of the game proper.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books in this series. This one however, was horrible.I felt like the characters were interchangable, I had to check often to see what point of view I was reading from. It felt like a completely different series. The storyline veered off into strange directions, and didn't hold my interest. The big secrets revealed were not at all what I expected. I felt it was anticlamactic. And the ending was terrible. Not just what happened to Tris, but the way it was written. It felt like I was reading fan fiction. I am just going to pretend I never read this book.
0525425772|5.0|What a lesson on civic engagement! This installment of the Theodore Boone series was a true page-turner. The action, suspense, PG-violence, with just the right amount of legalese on eminent domain and the galvanizing citizens' response to it, kept me enthralled in every chapter. If you don't want your child to question authority, don't let her read this book!<br />GO, THEO, GO!
B005I64U5C|5.0|I really like this movie. I love scifi so anything with aliens is ok with me. The 3D is good and any SciFi lover should like this movie.
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|I like the feel and do believe if dropped it would protect well. I received it about a week ago and the clear plastic back that is part of the protective edge is peeling away from the edge. It is getting scratches, I expected that, but not peeling loose from the edges.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Having watched the movie a number of times, i eventually got around to buying the book. As always, reading a book after having watched the movie made from it, the license taken by Hollywood to make the movie &#34;work&#34; become evident: for example that Idgie and Big George's murder trial only took place after Ruth had died, and that the detective who in that unforgettable scene tells Idgie &#34;&#34;...'cause I'm the law, and you cain't fool the law&#34; was actually the judge in the trial, or that he had actually warned Idgie to ensure that no trace was ever found of Frank Bennett if she wanted to avoid prosecution.<br />I'm also surprised that the love affair between Idgie and Ruth, which was central to the story, was treated with such diffidence in the movie. I thought we'd gotten beyond such nonsense when the move was made.<br />And of course the other disappointment, is that Evelyn's journey guided by the lesson she learend from Ninny Threadgoode, a central theme of the book, is played down so much in the movie.<br />Having said that, I'll watch the movie again albeit it through new eyes (I have the DVD), and I'll no doubt read the book again, to find those little nuggets of detail that I missed on the first reading.<br />All in all, a really good book, and well worth reading.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The first 50 pages are really boring, trying to explain everything that happened in the first two books, but it gets better after that.  Lots of great ideas worth discussing, like sacrifice and prejudice and love.
B005LBF7CY|3.0|Very average, felt like it had been written by an amateur. Storyline was good just the style of writing I did not feel was like her previous novels( of which I have read them all) disappointed!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I read this in one week, a daunting task for such a long book but I could not put it down and when I reached the end, I had tears in my eyes. The last five pages are so beautifully written that I had to read them aloud, in a very quiet voice, while sitting in the corner at Starbucks. Someone, please tell me, is there another book as compelling as this? Really. The last time I enjoyed a book this much was when I read George Elliot's &#34;Middlemarch.&#34; Books that engage you so fully, from beginning to end, are rare. I envy the reader who is just beginning &#34;The Goldfinch.&#34; You are in for a life-changing experience.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Works well for my Canon video camera.  The sound quality is good and the price was very appealing to me.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|An innovative theme that plugs into a mix of nostalgic sounds, this album still manages to maintain a fresh energy. Can't help but bop your head to it...a fantastic addition to Daft Punk's already killer repertoire...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Thanks for a great, no bull, manual to get published on the Kindle platform. Authors should read this free Kindle book  first.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|For a scientific calculator this will probably work for you. It's too elaborate for simple use, and useless as a financial calculator.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Limited use device (Youtube, Netflix and Hulu) but the price makes it much easier to justify.  I will be curious to see what Google does with this in future software releases.
B003JTHESA|3.0|It's good...but mostly not very memorable.  Sorry but that's how I feel about this one and their last disc...and a few in between.  This band really doesn't need to record any more material...really!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|My neice loves loves this movie so I had to get it for her for Christmas to go with her new Blu-ray, I think she wore it out in the first month.
B00632HWOG|5.0|IThis app. is quick , easy & very accessible .My mail is right there when I want it.  Love it !!
B0050UEVNM|5.0|Absolutely adore this movie!!! Intricately woven story and of course a sugary ending... But just delightful and top of my feel good movies!!
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|I have collected all of their DVD's, I love the band.  This IS a good show, no question...but I think the vocal mic on this recording sounds really bad and it drives me nuts.  It's very crispy, not a fan of the way some of these sounds were put on tape (or computer...however you look at it).  It's nice to see Mangini play these tunes...but I have to admit that I think the new self titled disc is 5 times better than A Dramatic Turn Of Events...just from the &#34;Song Writing&#34; standpoint.  The majority of this concert IS A Dramatic Turn.  All this said, if you are just getting into collecting their 6 or 7 live DVD's...these are my fav's...Score (an amazing show, but I also love Octovarium,, great disc) and even though it also doesn't sound great audio wise...&#34;performance wise&#34;...Live In Japan...their fist live outing on &#34;Images and Words&#34;...James is on fire on that one!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful story and thoughtfully written.  I could not stop reading, the story really kept my interest.  I continually tried to figure out where the author was going with the story and my thoughts always proved wrong.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book.
B00F5HWC7W|5.0|If your a fan of The Killers and have been since they came out like me then you probably just bought this because<br />you buy all their cd's.<br />To be honest i don't need a cd full of their singles i already own all their records and i could of just bought the 2 new tracks on Direct Hits and Mr Brightside Demo and When you were young remix for way cheaper but with that said<br />i bought this to support one of my fav bands and i thought there would be new artwork but its just full of their record covers and only 2 new photos but with that said This is great for someone who doesn't own their records and only know them for their singles or for a newbie Killers fan or for this new day and age kids that don't own cd's this would be great for someone to have all the best Killers singles into 1 cd.<br /><br />But for The Killers fans its nothing fancy its very simple looking artwork inside the cd looks like the cover<br />and i was somewhat disappointed with the artwork since its all their old record covers. Its just nothing new for The Killers fans and i wish there was more then 2 new tracks and i hate remixes and the demo of Mr Brightside isn't that much different then the Record version it doesn't sound like a real demo i was thinking it would be a strip down version like most demos but its very well mixed. To all The Killers fans that already own all their records this isn't a must have if you don't have the money for it right now then put it on an Xmas list for someone to buy for you or just buy the 4 new tracks to save some money. But i know The Killers fans and im sure pretty much every last one of you already bought this lol.
0465043577|5.0|If you have a strong math background as I do and you're looking for a book brimming with equations and high level math, you will be disappointed.  However, the way this book is written is among the best I've ever seen.  It does take him a little while to get to the point but you could also make a strong argument that he's just being thorough in laying the groundwork for the arguments he's making, which contradict a lot of modern finance.  It is an exceptional book and Dr. Mandelbrot is himself is an outstanding mathematician.  Highly recommended!
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|It's a little bit more mellow than their usual stuff but it's nice to listen to and relaxing. For the price it's not bad to pick up.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Lots of problems opening it.  But fun when it did work. To frustrating with opening on kindle. Creative not violent
B004GYY714|2.0|When I first downloaded this app I was very happy. Great radio station to choose from.  Anything I wanted to hear and bud a boom bud a Bing there it was. Then about two weeks ago I got a notice for a &quot;update &quot; I thought how can they make something so good even better. Well in click on the accept bar and all that good service and great radio went phifff...<br />Now if you can even get a station to play it's only for a few minutes and you get &quot;can't play this station now. please try again later.<br />I really don't care for iheart but at least I can find a station that works for more than 5 minutes at a time. I 'm giving them a few more days but most likely will remove this app.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Kept me wanting to see what was next....  history is a good thing... it is where we come from.. searching for the truth!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Tells you to upgrade to get newer things then sends you back to the beginning with no way to login in to your old park. Not cool on any level
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Same plot line as the first two with Doug going missing. In this one, the jokes aren't nearly as funny and the funny moments are a lot fewer and far between. This one left me feeling like  a hangover...with a headache!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Love it! It had comedy, adventure and a bit of drama. I would recommend it to everyone of every age.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|I have used it for years on my pc's & it has worked beautifully , flawsley. I m ow using it on my kindle tablet & it is working very well here.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book was amazing. I give it five stars because of how it is like a puzzle. All the pieces of story throughout the book finally come together in the end. But, since there is still one more book, we only have desperate chunks of the full big picture. I love the characters in this book because you can never predict what they are going to do next. There are so many twists and turns, I couldn't put it down! I recommend this book for 10 and up, and people who enjoy action, adventure, a little bit of mystery and romance, sci-fi, and a fun read! One of my top 20 favorite books!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie. I read the first one and loved it. This is no exception. Truly amazing. Can't wait to read the next one. Everyone should read this book.
1401235417|5.0|AMAZING Story and Art. A must have for any Batman fan.  Capullo and Snyder are truly the dynamic duo for DC Comics.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wow! I read Gone Girl and it blew my mind. I saw the author had written previous books and decided to check this one out. Again mind blown. In these books you think you know what's going on and get surprised. Very good at keeping g me engaged throughout the entire story.
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|Wonderfully told, intruiging story, full of suspense, twists and turns. I could not put it down, always wanting to know what happened next!
B009XI7RF6|5.0|This game starts off so simply that you might not think that it is worth playing.  Just stick with it for a while though.  Before you know it you are lured into some puzzles that will have your full attention.  I particularly like the options to redo your last move or, if necessary, starting all over.  You will need a little knowledge about color and a lot of determination in this game.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Very compelling story of how wealth and drugs can ruin one man and cause collateral damage to those around watching the proverbial train wreck.  Narcissistic is an understatement, but self doubt and insecurity fueled this wolf.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Not only the actors but the storyline here is amazing. And it's a sobering look into we don't know what we don't know.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Not a great film but it's fun and funny -- perfect for an evening of mindless entertainment to relax by.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very cute addictive game. I always want to expand my village and add more families to my village very addictive
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|The whole album is awesome! Love Lady Gaga! I love her music and her new album does not disappoint. Cool
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Really good follow up the &#34;Time to Kill&#34; but the ending left me with a &#34;want for more&#34;...but as usual, John Grisham is a great story-teller.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Lots of good information and Tim's writing style is entertaining. He does have facts to back up his claims. Do yourself a favor if you get this - read it in chunks as he suggests. Want to lose fat? Read those sections he lists. Want to gain muscle? Read those sections. This is more of a manual than a mantra.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Very good and it is in my price range.  I will be looking forward to buy more video.  Thank you.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I haven't read The Shining, only seen the movie, but this book was a page turner from the beginning. Anyone who likes Stephen King will love this book.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|Fantastic movie! Science in it is totally screwed up but as long as you are watching just for fun.... who cares?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Extremely entertaining and hard to put down. Although you can figure out the book and how it will end, it is still worth the read. A good way to distract yourself from the everyday world.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the is th best game ever and it has no blood and no language so all parents shouled let there fhiled dounload and play this game I promess you will love this game
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is better than the computer. At first its hard but then it gets easier. My only complaint is on the computer its free.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing. Beautiful. Full of fascination and thrilling events. Pulls you into the world of factions and makes you wonder where you would belong. Can't put it down!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Just a great sci-fi / philosophical journey through the universe, and both Jodi Foster and Matthew McCongehey (sp?) are very, very good.  I hadn't watched it for over 5 years, and it was even better than I remembered it to be!
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Absolutely Awful! Looks like Iron Man on steroids. So tired of lizards! No originality. I definitely would not recommend this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love Grisham, and Sycamore Row has not disappointed me.  He is a great writer and wonderful story teller.  I am already looking forward to his next book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|First of all NO redstone lamps,pistons,or even normal redstone,and to top all that off,<br />There are absolutely no mods,I went on the minecraft pe mod forum and looked at all<br />The mods,they were all either for 1.7.6 or all the others,I could not find one mod for<br />This version! I WANT MY MONEY BACK , So entile there is a mod,there's no way I'm<br />Playing this game again,just by XBOX 360 edition or pc and just watch the difference
B005HED08I|3.0|Amazon prime streaming video does not work consistently with ubuntu.  This is strange since ubuntu apparently partners with Amazon for music services, yet a standard current ubuntu installation 13.10 does not play amazon videos.  I have some technical prowess and have been able to troubleshoot this before, but now, it does not work, whatever I try.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it I'm on it and I egnore my grand children and they yell and I yell back ha ha
B005LY4B0A|3.0|It's okay. It downloaded quickly. This game requires one think through the steps they will take before they take them.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it is really fun<br />you can upgrade cars and get new ones. plus its free. you can buy tons of mapps
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most entertaining game I have ever played.  It keeps you on the edge if your toes and very good for the mind and eyes.
044022425X|5.0|The book was brand new.  It is the 4th in the series and matched the binding of my other books.
B00E7SFAAG|2.0|It downloaded with no problems. I deleted it from my Kindle. One of the children liked a lot how much injury was inflicted on Granny as she tried to catch up to the boy.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I had started playing terraria on my Xbox then on my iPod an  then on my computer. I used to search it on my kindle and couldn't find anything. Then yesterday I searched on my new kindle and it was there.As soon as I saw it I bought it an  played it and loved it. I have not gotten far yet but I will. Great price too. :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|Working on jigsaw puzzles was always a family activity as I grew-up.  Its great to have a jigsaw puzzle with me when ever I want.  This product offers a huge variety of puzzles that are fun to play.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|This is an awesome album!  Haunting beautiful voice and beats!  Reminds me of the music I loved from the 80's (erasure, new order etc...) mixed with a fresh sound.  You will not be disappointed!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A really well written book which seems to be careening towards a bang of an ending, but then disappoints at the end. Wish there was a little more substance at the end, rather than a quiet fade out.
B000035P5E|4.0|Great movie!  Kept us on the edge of our seats the whole time. A thriller with historical theme of the war throughout. The acting was great.
B00F99EMRE|5.0|I was suspect at first because I liked the original but I read the rolling stone mag article with Geddy and he explained he thought it was overcooked originally. After listening I am glad I bought it.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|The totally fun backstory to Anthony Bourdain, where he came from and why he's where he's at today.  A rollicking good read.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Great movie! A Classic! Good for all ages to watch around the holidays. My 7 year old loved it! the end
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A very good book. I love the references to older computer and video games. May be I am old so I know what it was about. Not sure my kids would get all the old references.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great series! Burned through the book in  a few days of reading.I highly recommend for readers who enjoyed the first two books.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I love this Walking Dead series.  Each year it gets better and better.  I enjoy a series that it character driven, rather than a show obsessed with &#34;zombies&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I despise authors who expect is to invest in character through a series and then end it the way this one did. I will no read anything else from this author in the future.
1400069807|3.0|Most of what Moss writes in this book is: 1. true, and 2. already well-known to about anyone who lives in America. It's not exactly ground breaking news that food corporations care a lot more about profits than about people's health. It's well known that processed foods and sodas cause obesity and are not health food. Another flaw with  SSS is that it goes on way too long--he interviews so many different corporations reps that it becomes tedious after a while.<br /><br />I also disagree with some of his conclusions--he opposes a soda tax because that will &#34;punish the consumer.&#34; That's a strange way of looking at it--the tax is meant to encourage safer consumption of healthier beverages, which will help the consumer. I tend to agree with Moss that ultimately reducing poverty is the main cause of poor food choices, but that is not something that is discussed at any length in the book; it is also not likely to happen anytime soon. While SSS is not terrible, a Pulitzer prize winner should be able to write a better book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I suggest everyone who likes a great book to read it. It is my favorite book ever. It also is happy and a little sad
B00E9P959O|3.0|Being a sound engineer (and a drummer) I am often wishing I could have (re)mixed a certain album.  This is one of them.  The major issue with the original Vapor Trails was that the drums were butchered by over limiting.  They sound distorted and lack punch and clarity.  This remix is a swing in the other direction.  The bass drum is now the loudest thing in the mix and has been equalized to sound like something you'd find on heavy metal album with too much high frequency &#34;click click.&#34;  I found it distracting and completely unnecessary.  Otherwise the drums sound great...almost to the point where I wonder if they used sound replacement on the snare.  The rest of the mix sounds pretty good, but I'm finding there are only a couple tracks where I may prefer the new mix to the old one.  I tend to prefer the original blend of vocal harmonies and more prominent guitar.  If I could only have one it would be the original.  But, it's one of their best albums in terms of composition and performance and I highly recommend checking out one of the two versions.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Disturbing, surprising and haunting in it's explicit depiction of Will Grahmn, with the subtle intensity of Dr. Lectors brilliant manipulation.  This is truly a worthy prequel story to one of the most intense villians every portrayed on the screen.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|No fun, I thought is was a stupid game.  Grow up.  Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame.  Booyah
B000W93CHC|5.0|I love the book!  Great writing by Follet! Riveting! I had to read until 4am just to finish the book.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Couldn't live without it! I love learning new information about the world we live in and the people and events that change it
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When I first got the app, everything was fine.  I updated my app, and now half the time I can't see the pictures that are shared, or with  shared posts, I can read the text but  any picture with the post don't show up.  I have tried uninstalling and installing, and keep having the same problem.  I don't know if it's because I have a Kindle Fire HD, but it is a very frustrating situation.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Great escape movie in the Daniel Craig era of James Bond. Lots of entertainment and action.If you enjoy James Bond movies, ypu'll like this one.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|A fantastic read, took a little while to get fully engaged but after that couldn't put it down.  The twists and turns were fantastic, didn't see them coming.  Characters were well developed and interesting.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|It took a lot of getting into and I was going to give up on it but persevered.<br />There were some anomalies but also some good descriptive writing.  I didn't<br />understand the main female character's reaction to the discovery of the truth.
0307352153|5.0|Thanks for writing this book, It is nice to see someone praising the qualities I have, instead of insisting we all act like extroverts
B004UPALT6|2.0|A very strange film and I wasn't really sure what to make of it.  This was much more of a comedy than a horror film to me.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|It keeps your interest right from the beginning. He's a wealth guy with dreams of being more. I can see where the Bond movies have so much of him in them. Wonderful reading and looking forward to reading more of the books in this line.
B005KP7EO0|2.0|VERY slow, don't quite get the movie.  The original Butch was funny, fun and had great action.  Not so much here
B00013M6NK|4.0|Of course it has the Nikon warranty to work well but for the price of one you can get two Wasabi brand batteries plus wall charger plus car charger, plus warranty and they work just this oem battery.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0049WBZ1I B0049WBZ1I]]
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good story.  Good characters were established.  A little bit mystery and son  Good thoughts to think about.  Not a clear cut answer to what should have happened.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I could hardly go to sleep.  I accomplished little until I finished this book.  No Hollywood story but real and intriguing characters instead who keep the reader engaged.  A great read!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing book about courage and faith. So much so that it has renewed my faith. Great book, great story and thanks to all the military personal out there.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|too much extraneous dialogue and information that does not add interest to the story line that drags the book along to its conclusion.<br />trying to keep it all straight is difficult.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|This was a great movie. I highly recommend it! I grew up in Arkansas and it captures small town life there in a very authentic way. The acting is top notch, and the story draws you in. Watch it!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Wow - first Cohen I have paid attention to - won't be the last.  Odd coming into the later works - did the same thing with Stevie Ray and can't get enough - so Leonard - here come the royalties.
B004KPX4W2|1.0|It never downloaded!!  I was still charged!!!  The system for download or streaming is unclear, & resulted in no viewing at a future time!!!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This is a great movie to watch during the Halloween season. I highly recommend it as one of the classics.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Cute looking fantasy sets.  Overall an interesting retell of Oz, focused on Oz and the witches.  Witch story was decent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and just challenging enough<br />Just when you want to quit you figure it out and want to keep going
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|I got to see Vin Diesel and my hubby got to see Riddick, his favorite anti-hero!  Unlike some girls, I love sci-fi/horror.  This movie kept me entertained from start to finish.  The only thing that sucked was Karl Urban's character, Vaako, only had like 3 minutes of screen time.
1400052181|5.0|This true story involves you in the lives of the characters immediately. You feel their hopes, fears, joys and sorrows on a personnel level. You feel you know the people through the writer and that you are engaged in the fate of their lives.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|It was in excellent condition and I enjoyed watching it.  Also, it was purchased at a good price.  I received it in a timely manner.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Good movie.  Hard to watch at times due to realization that it is a true story.  Would not have watched it if I had not known that they all survived.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|stops the game too often trying to sell you more &#34;helpers&#34;.  Addicting game to play, but fun way to kill time.
B00594MB2M|5.0|Very well done movie, great Paris scenes, English sub-titles very good, easy to follow, not exactly word-for-word but very close.  Interesting and not predictable, several twists and turns that kept the interest.  Now I want to go back to Paris!
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I had believed that I would never find new music I loved again.<br />Lana has proven me wrong.  Highly talented artist.<br />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love Castle and watch it as often as possible.  The characters keep you invested in their lives and interested in their future.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I must say I want not a huge fan of the ending. All in all not too bad. Looking forward to the movie.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book gets better every time I read it! It is so romantic and charming; much better than modern romance novels!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love Mahjong.  Happy to have it handy to play.  It is colorful and easy-to-use.  It is more fun than Solitare
B00902AKK4|5.0|I really enjoy this game on Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It plays well, offers plenty of head scratching challenge, and best of all links me to YouTube videos for solutions when I'm stuck. It doesn't constantly try to link to Facebook or GameCircle which makes me nuts with so many games. I play games to engage my mind, not to compete with myself or anyone else.  I don't see my game playing as a public event.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Works great and easy to use. I have sharpened just about every kind of blade i have except my axes.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This Album does it again. Em secured his place with Rap royalty.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I loved this book.  I married a man who had high functioning autism and one of my children had high functioning autism.  While the book exaggerates what it is like to be in a relationship with a person with autism, it is not as all offensive.  Rather, it is laugh-out-loud funny.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|This blue ray #3D gives yoiu a clear picture, however is very loud when in playing mode. I like to know why is so loud!!!
B0091VYG86|4.0|Good ole movie. Was interesting to watch and retained my attention the whole movie. Never judge a book by its cover.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|My 4 year old son is into sharks and has watched every Shark Week episode.  I decided to let him watch Jaws after years of emulating the classic Jaws sound during bath-time with his toy shark. My son loved it of course; however I forgot how simple the graphics were back then and how fake the Hollywood shark looked. Jaws will always be  Classic!
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|This physics-based game is indeed eccentric. You play as King Oddball, some sort of alien lifeform who wants to destroy the world using nothing but his tongue and lots of rocks. It's kind of like Angry Birds meets Beetlejuice. From the art style and original background music to King Oddball and his disturbingly strong tongue and the tongue-in-cheek humor - everything fits together surprisingly well to create a very entertaining game. I think it would've been fun to see the meeting where this game came into being! I want to take a wild guess and say sleep deprivation and/or copious amount of alcohol were involved...<br /><br />Once you make it to the second level, you start earning achievements. There are also other bonus items such as the diamond stage where you earn diamonds by replaying old levels without using all your available rocks. All these add to the replay value greatly.<br /><br />The game's only permissions are for internet access, which presumably are for the link that takes you to a list of other games made by the developer. The game does include Flurry Analytics, which is an add-on that tracks how you use your app and reports back to the developer. You can opt out of it at Flurry.com, but you do have to give them your device ID number, not to mention you have to trust they will actually honor your opt-out request. It's up to you if this is acceptable - I just want you to at least be aware of its presence.<br /><br />Pro:<br />-unique and eccentric (art style, music, premise)<br />-no ads or in-app purchase<br />-polished (didn't encounter any crashes or force closes)<br />-no excessive premissions<br /><br />Con:<br />-includes Flurry Analytics<br /><br />Summary:<br />King Oddball is an uniquely fun time-killer. The only downside is the inclusion of Flurry. I am not sure if I would have bought the game at the normal price of $2.99, but as today's free app of the day, it's worth a quick download to test it out for yourself.
1476727651|5.0|Absolutely riveting! I wasn't expecting it, but I'm glad King gave us all-grown-up Dan's story, making everything come full circle. A horrifying and ultimately satisfying companion to The Shining. No question about it; Doctor Sleep deserves every one of those 5 stars!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Loved them the first time and again in blueray. Wish I bought the other animated features too. Go get them!
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|A very easy read, thought provoking with a great ending! Enjoyed this book and so did the 6 others in my book club.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Me.....  Wasn't captivating or that exciting. Kind of corny if you ask me. Probably wouldn't watch it again unless it was free
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Able to print from Kindle Fire through my wireless HP printer. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because, it isn't clear how to print an e-mail, etc. (if it's able to do that like a laptop or desktop). I thought it would be more like my computer where the option to print would be on even my web pages, but I don't see that on the Kindle. Haven't taken the time to research though, so it may be there somewhere. But it is nice to be able to print from the Kindle Fire HD.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|Great movie. However the 3d was not through the entire movie which was a bust for my 3d tv. Had to wait for startrek into darkness
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Like the title says, I've tried downloading and installing this game multiple times on two different devices. Both could not open the game, which was quite frustrating as I had to delete other games to make room for it. I really wanted to see what the craze was all about...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy and simple, yet challenging enough to make you think. Great brain teaser! Prepare to be addicted for a few hours! Looking forward to more!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is totally addicting! I refuse to buy more turns or special candies, so I am forced to take a break until it allows me back in, so that's ok. The game is a challenge to get through the levels, but I have just started, so am unable to evaluate the higher levels (but lots of friends are playing it and are much further ahead of me). I like games like this that are pretty mindless, but can be challenging to make the correct moves to make the most of your turns.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is the best 3d movie I've seen so far, but you will need a 3d player and tv before you can watch this at home.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|In comparison to the first two books in this series, I was very disappointed. The point of view changes between Tris and Tobias every chapter but the tone never changed. If each chapter hadn't told me who was speaking, it would have been difficult to differentiate the two. All the events just seemed repetitive and the ending was a shocker. I think I would have been able to forgive the author for her decision on the ending if the rest of the book had been good. It just seemed to me that she didn't know where to go with the end of this story and quickly threw together some ill thought out ideas just to finish things off.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is really fun, I just wish you didn't run out of lives! Could play it for hours! Yay!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love using it and the concept is great.  I cannot give it 5 stars because of limited zoom capabilities.  In periodicals and some non-fiction books, it's important to be able see detail in the accompanying photos.  If you primarily read novels, then by all means, this is the best I've used.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Surprisingly good story on the zombie nonsense. I did not pay for the theatrical experience but 99 cents is unbeatable price for this unexpected entertainment!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought this series as I was getting on a plane and looking for something to pass the time (and the price couldn't be beat). Little did I know that I would be totally sucked in.  Looking forward to reading Shift.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|It's fun but it keeps randomly shutting my tablet. I have to reboot it a lot, go back to the game, hope it saved where I was (it rarely does), & hope it doesn't shut me down again. It happens with different puzzles each time so there's no pattern. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't shut my tablet down - & it's really bad if you're some place with no WiFi.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|not much of a gamer but keeps me coming back every day to play  enticing and enthralling be good if you earned more credits tho
B0092MKTL2|1.0|Like the other comments, the one star is for the poor mastering of the album and not for the songs or the artist.  The mastering sounds horrible, as if I'm in a night club with massive distortion.  I can't even hear the vocal.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the start of the book, but about half way through it was like she just got tired of writing and was just trying to tie up all the story lines from the prior book.  It became so depressing.  How many bad things can happen to these people.  And to then kill off the main character with no warning!  I was so disappointed in the ending.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|My mom loves this. Everything in the DVD worked perfect. She is in love with this very talented virtuoso.-Buy it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the most disturbing book I've read since I read a Wally Lamb book years ago. What a horrible waste of time. I'm having really hard time wondering what all the hype was about. This was  an awful book!  Unfortunately to get my review in, I had to give it one star, really wanted zero stars!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a lovely story that both brought tears to my eyes and laughter and a smile to my face. The sentimentality and sensitivity expressed as you wander through the Middle Eastern culture expressed by these peoples daily lives is wonderful to read. I recommend it highly, especially to people who want to understand more about this culture.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|you should realy make the full version free and/or let you record your own messages and if you dont make the full version free than you should let you pick atleast one song from your invintor but be sides that i love it
B004GHNIRK|5.0|this classic speaks of the human condition, and touches us where we live. There is some of. the hero and some of the villain in each of us. I came away wanting to live up to God's potential within me.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|I thought the robot was going to be a stand alone bookend, but it ended up being the case. Movie was still great and my wife enjoyed it too.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Fun game. Awesome for free, and better if you spend just a little bit of real money. The graphics and upgrading system make it worth the ridiculous amount of hours you could spend on it.
1250038820|5.0|Awesome!  Have told so many people about the book and to follow the author on facebook.  Great stories and pics
B005MMY9A8|5.0|All the acting in this movie was spot on. As well it should be with a cast like this. Evenly balanced action, humour and with a story line that captures your attention from the get go. Must see.
1932735410|5.0|There are many subjects in the book and various area of project management. This book will let you know what is your gap and which area you should find more information in other source to improve yourself after passed the exam.
0374214913|3.0|This book begins in a tantalizing way, and it excited me about what would come next next.  There is a mystery surrounding the bookstore and tidbit by tidbit of information, I felt more and more invested in the main character's journey.  The build up throughout the book kept me engaged and interested, until I got to the end.  For me, the explanation I was waiting for never came, or if it did, it wasn't very satisfying.  I would've given five stars if not for the ending, because I thought the writing style was quite good.
B0028R3NCU|1.0|Junk. It fried after loading files to it a few times. Stay away and save your money. Do not buy!!
B008GWOVB8|5.0|American Classic!! Remember this from high school days. Brings back some good ol fun with the musical that was done in this movie. A must watch!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|His best yet!!! If I could give it 10 stars I would for sure!!  Lyrical genius.  And I gained new respect for kendrick Lamar also.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The book was exciting, full of accurate information and very well written.  It grabbed me on the first page and kept me<br />interested.  I am a big fan of A Time to Kill, and it was fun to revisit some of those characters and situations.
B0081336FO|3.0|Mildly interesting. I am a big fan of the original SH stories and the Basil Rathbone shorts.  This series lacks the intrigue, story lines and the acting to be frank. While somewhat entertaining I just cannot get into it. I would much rather watch an old Basil Rathbone flick  for the tenth time than to seek this show out. Sorry.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Damages is some kind of series.  Glenn Close is ruthless.  The second season continues the saga of passion, deception and suspense.  I have all the seasons and each season will certainly hold your attention.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I just enjoy the conflict and mystery the yumminess. It's addictive.  It's hard to figure out who I think she should be with both are endearing it's complicated.  Also she is an amazing actress.  Now she she portrays 3 different characters!  What can't she do!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Definitely should have this for your Go Pro. My first cases  were not skeletons and the audio ended up muffled and the unit got hot in &#34;challenging&#34; conditions.  I highly recommend ordering extra lenses. These babies get scratched easily!!!
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Great suspenseful action packed story. Some shoot em up here so maybe not a great family choice. Has some of the best car chase scenes ever. Good acting and story with some unexpected twists.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic series... I watched from beginning to the current episode in only a few days and cannot believe I have to wait until January for the new season!! Something to look forward to after the long Holiday Season is over...
B001MM28JG|5.0|Seriously funny for any fan of Science Fiction. Stellar cast too! I could watch it over and over again and never be tired of the humor. Just plain good fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a hit with my middle school students, and they can't wait to finish reading the series, if they haven't already, and see the next movie coming out (Catching Fire).  There's plenty of gruesome action to keep everyone entertained, but it's not too graphic for most students from grade 5 and up.  I highly recommend it for 5th grade through adults.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I found this book delightful.  I couldn't wait to see what would happen next and was very happy with the ending .  I recommend the book.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|AWESOME app! A MUST have! Installs fast, and never has frozen, or needed to be stopped. Love it! Makes it easy and quick to post my tweets!
B00F8MIIKO|4.0|The movie is fast paced and well done. The short story following pertaining to two umbrellas is well done.  The additional bonus material might be interesting if the sound had downloaded properly.  As it is I can only watch the video as there is no sound.  Otherwise I might have given five stars to it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Wanted these movies last year, but they were out of them durig the sale at Best Buy.  After knowing the sale I missed, I just couldn't pay full price for them, so I have never gotten them, til now.  Feel like I got a deal with this price
0525478817|5.0|Where to start with The Fault in our Stars?  John Green writes a moving and sad story of modern star-crossed lovers.  Hazel is a teenage girl living with terminal cancer.  While her cancer is currently responding to a particular drug, she knows that she will eventually sucumb to this disease.  Hazel tries to seal herself off from the world around her, sure she will cause eventual pain to everyone close to her.  Enter Augustus Waters: a charming teenage boy in remission from his osteosarcoma.  The two bond over Hazel's obsession with the book An Imperial Affliction and begin a relationship through which they both grow, support and learn to love.<br /> John Green's daring novel touches on something many teens don't, or don't want to, think about: their own mortality.  This text is magical and painful and tragic and disappointing and surprising.  I would love to teach this text alongside Romeo and Juliet.  Green's Augustus Waters is such a special character and readers get to watch as he breaks down Hazel's walls and deals with things that no teen should have to deal with.  This text would be great to teach in a classroom or to read in a book club.  There is a lot to discuss and, trust me, when you finish it you're going to want to talk about it.<br />Green includes a few twists and takes the novel exactly where you don't think he will take it.  He fills the book with deep, thought provoking quotes; the type of quotes that teens will post as their statuses and tweet for weeks after finishing it.  This will definitely be many adolescents' favorite books.  This book resists many cliches.  It does not have a happy ending and definitely does not play into what the reader wants.  Green follows the tragic reality that things don't always play out how you want, or expect.  Many readers will ache for more closure, but I feel that Green ends the text perfectly.  The Fault in our Stars is a must read.  Keep tissues handy.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|OMG! It is ADDICTING! I love the space theme! It gives the game a new, harder twist! Gravity is a bummer, isn't it? LOL! Just kidding! This game is a good brain exerciser for any game playing age!
B00DQU6RLW|5.0|A fantastic vinyl version of Dark Side the Moon...this is the one you want. I have requests to put it on all the time by my friends who can't find reasonably priced copies. Honestly, its worth the money.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Very exciting episode lots of twist and turns heart pounding high octane episode, I am truly a fan of this t.v show the best season yet 2013
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I reviewed &#34;Before Sunrise&#34;, the prequel to this film and said how surprised I was that the premise, two attractive people, walking around in a beautiful European city talking, could be an engaging film.  Imagine my surprise that Linklater pulls it off again, 9 years latter (in the story) with the 2 stars who look much more jaded and tired than they did in the earlier film.  I recommend both.
0385537131|5.0|In a stunning and highly successful sequel to Grisham's earlier novel, A Time to Kill, this brings the reader back to the courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi where young attorney Jake Brigance is once again thrown into the midst of a tense case involving race and seething anger.  This time, it is a $24 million estate left by a terminally ill farmer (Seth Hubbard) who writes his own family out of the will and leaves the bulk of the estate to his black housekeeper before hanging himself.  Jake must defend the will against legal challenges from the family and an army of slick lawyers.  The legal maneuvering, surprise attacks and twists of fortune will keep the pages turning in vintage Grisham manner.
B0000707YX|4.0|Sounds great on vinyl. Of course its a long album, so you'll have four sides to deal with, which does kind of break up the album. But honestly, there's almost nothing better than &#34;Coma&#34; coming at you in beautiful analog.
B0042K6G6Q|5.0|I really love it. I don't have time for watch TV. This option is it perfect to me and the story is really good
B001NA6096|4.0|I would not have thought that a movie comprised merely of beautiful scenery and two people talking would work so well, but this does.  The two leads are beautiful young people and the acting is excellent.  The story becomes totally believable.
1476727651|4.0|If there is one novel that came out in 2013 with gigantic expectations, it was Stephen King's long-awaited followup to The Shining. The moment the man so much as hinted a few years ago at writing a sequel to what might be his most frightening work, we fans were set to vibrate, practically buzzing with anticipation. I dare say only Justin Bieber's army of feral tweens could rival the level of SQUEE heard from King's readership.<br /><br />There is a heck of a lot of preamble, at least it feels that way ,before Doctor Sleep can get to the meat of its story. Danny's formative years are highlighted in the aftermath of the Overlook Hotel, until the story finally settles into present day with Dan Torrance as a forty-something alcoholic. He's listless, moving from town to town, and drinking himself into oblivion in an effort to dull his senses--and the shining.<br /><br />Then Dan hits rock bottom. After one fateful night, he sobers up and finds himself befriended in a small New Hampshire town, working in a hospice as an orderly. Without the booze, the shining returns, but he manages to harness it, becoming known as Doctor Sleep among his nursing home coworkers and the residents there, aiding the dying in their final moments to move on to the great unknown. Things turn sinister though, when he learns of a young girl named Abra who exhibits an even stronger shine than his, and a roving band of killers called the True Knot that feed on people like them.<br /><br />Where The Shining had a claustrophobic and isolated atmosphere with the Overlook as the dominant setting, Doctor Sleep has a vagabond heart. It encompasses Dan's story, and Abra Stone's, and even members of the True Knot, as they crisscross the American highways until their inevitable showdown.<br /><br />It's spellbinding work in terms of breathing life into these characters, but as far as providing any substantial suspense, the story falters. As sinister--and even sympathetic--as the True Knot may be, especially their leader Rose the Hat, it becomes readily apparent they are outmatched by the sheer, raw power of Abra and Dan, despite having the shining pair outnumbered. Frankly, I found more dread in Dan's ordeal with alcoholism and battling the skeletons in his closet than with the actual villains of the piece. Heck, even the growing frailty that befalls the baleful bindlestiffs draws its own measure of dread. It's utterly human, and no mesmerizing scene of the supernatural outweighs it on the page.<br /><br />Despite the winks and nods, despite the blatant callbacks, and despite the shining itself, Doctor Sleep bears little resemblance to The Shining. And that's fine by me. It's been more than a quarter-century. I may not have been on the edge of my seat, but I was definitely captivated. And I think it would have been foolhardy to expect this novel to be The Shining Part Two. It's a different beast, much like its author.their leader Rose the Hat, it becomes readily apparent they are outmatched by the sheer, raw power of Abra and Dan, despite having the shining pair outnumbered.

B00G4A6VZS|5.0|My kids are learning SO MUCH about countries, capital cities, flags - more than I know about some of the obscure places in the world - and they are only 7.  This and Stack the States taught them more in one week than they can learn in school in years.  HIGHLY recommend for kids.
B000VX4X36|5.0|I tried on some Timberland shoes at a local store and found that the &#34;8&#34; was the best fit in that shoe, so I gambled thinking that an 8 would be what I needed in the 3-eye Classic model.  I was right, the models were different but the sizing the same.  Thanks, lets hope the Saloman Speedcross 3 I just bought turns out the same.  I ordered size 8 again having tried on several name brands of running shoe though one of them was not Saloman.  Cross your fingers!  Thanks, Brandon

A giant head which hurls rocks with its tounge is something that I have never seen before.<br /><br />Pro<br /><br />Unique style<br />Lots of levels<br /><br />Con<br /><br />A bit pricy, maybe 99c would be a better price<br />No exit button, doesn't quit with back button<br />Graphics get old after a while, could use a little more polish<br />Maybe a little too simple?

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This was a riveting film that demonstrated the devastating impact of addiction.  Denzel's performance was strong.  The story was realistic, the emotions powerful.  Would highly recommend.
B003XURDAY|1.0|Not the Edition I wanted!<br />I wanted the first un-cut edition, not this edition, anyone know where I can find one?
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Any read with Harry Bosch in it is well worth the purchase.  I recommend these stories to any reader. Michael Connelly will not disappoint.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Overall, the worst of the 3 books by far.  Poor character development, thin story and weak ending.  I was really disappointed.
B00CN3U8TA|5.0|Just received  he has a pretty good sculpt very impressed with it he's  left foot looks a little weird but it's probably cause he has ankle pivot  on the stand itself is very Greenish wash  texture  color stand out I think he's a better sculpt better  then the first one ( don't own but saw reviews pics )  box itself came a little Bent corners cause of the packaging but not as bad i'm a MOC  collector movie was pretty good don't own much Marvel select but I'm very impressed with their packaging<br /> posted pictures as well Hope it help
B004LWZWGA|5.0|A fitting end to an aging Hero......from pain to awakening, through wisdom, into enlightenment.......not all lessons need to be so painful....but then, we chose not Our Sorrows
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love to out score my friends. How lucky can I get and get a better score. if I get stuck on a level I go back and try to do better on a past level.
B00G91WB3S|3.0|To all the writers and directors out there. PLEASE stop making movies were the plot and story line is dictated by what the CGI department can do. Yes, we know the CG nerds are great at what they do, but it is becoming very obvious in these action movies that the plot is being forced to conform to the CGI rather than the CGI being used to compliment the story line and plot. The use of so many CGI effects is that they start making it so unrealistic that it becomes laughable and just plain silly.<br />While this is really a good movie, there are quite a few things which were over done or just did not quite fit properly.<br />First thing. Spaceships? In a Superman movie?<br />It is explained that Superman got his powers from the radiation from the sun, but later had them go away because of the air on Gen. Zod's spaceship? Yet he is perfectly fine flying in space.<br />It took years of exposure of sunlight for Clark to gain his powers, yet a couple of hours out of their space suits and Zods crew gets them. Oh.. That's right, it was the air again. Not the sun.<br />Every fight scene, someone is getting plowed through the ground.<br />How many fly into the gut, then crash through a bunch of building sequences do were really need in a movie? A lot less than were in this one.<br />Lois Lane falling, only to be saved by Superman at the last second. Almost a requirement in an &#34;I can fly&#34; action movie and a great tie-in to the original, but PLEASE... sure Superman saves her numerous times, but lets everyone fall to their death? Wait. He did save one other, but still, did she really have to fall from the sky every 30 minutes.<br />Way too many saved at the last second scenes.<br />Quite a few scenes that jumped away to something else and never concluded the tangent. At times it felt like parts of the movie skipped ahead, or was edited badly. Others just didn't added anything to the story.<br />The flashback sequences were annoying to say the least, and were often too long or detailed to make the story flow correctly. Namely the tornado scene. Several un-needed minutes and action to simply tell us that Jonathan didn't think the world was ready to know about Clarks powers, and then at the end was narrated with dialog anyway.<br />The killer of the whole thing was that Gen. Zod was crashed, smashed, burnt, shot, blown up, plowed through the ground, and knocked through buildings, yet remained unhurt, but is killed by getting his neck broken?<br />Past all that, it was a good movie and a decent restart of the original.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|An interesting and well written story by a very couragous young women. This should be required reading for high school kids.
B005DNPHN4|5.0|One of the best movies ever produced. I could watch it over and over again. I love the first scene in Germania.
B000024A70|5.0|It's queens greatest hits.  What more needs to be said?  If you love Queen you'll love this album.  All their best songs are on it.  Rock on Wayne.  Rock on Garth.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's a first rate soap opera.  Great cast, superb costumes and sets, wonderful script that keeps you invloved.  likeable characters who you begin to &#34;care&#34; about and or dislike.  And for me anything with the truly superb Maggie Smith keeps me tuning in.  My one hope for the coming season is please, please no more Shirley McClaine!  She's miscast and jarring because of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I love it.<br />This game is so good I hope you get the game and enjoy in.<br />I enjoy this game .
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|very real movie about addiction and denial. Writer must have had personal experience in this area, or was very thorough in his research.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Wonderful game to relax to. Easy to use and no you glitches yet! Kudos! I would love if more puzzles were available, but who doesn't!?
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like it because it really makes me think things through! I appreciate the hints as well and I'm not punished for missteps.
B006PTNQGU|5.0|Great movie from Culkins heyday with a good message towards the end. Definatley would recommend it to anyone with kids.
B000WCDBKM|2.0|The movie had a good premise, and some good parts in it, but some of the events were needless and made no sense.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from being a total washout was that Johnny Depp was in it.
0761172726|5.0|This has been my &#34;go-to&#34; calendar for years...I had tried switching to another, but came back to this one!  Perfect for our family of 5!
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|This particular film of Mel Brooks is one of my favorite.  It is filled with great acting,<br />great story line, and has WARMTH beyond words.  And it goes without saying<br />funny.<br /><br />Thank you
B007IXWL2C|5.0|loved the story.  i will look forward to more of this authors book in the future.  don't know what else to say except i loved it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Like so many of his novels, Sycamore Row grabs right from the start and never lets you go. They all seem to end to soon.
B00E8TWPI4|4.0|Kids love this movie! Fun songs to sing and dance to! This movie was a summer favorite, but we now can enjoy it year round!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I haven't read any Preston/Child books in some years.  This made me want to go back and start with the first novel and read them all again.
B00A2GQIHG|5.0|Whitney Houston is one of the best female singer,even though she is no longer with us, she will always be loved.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good. Thought provoking. A great read. Suzanne can bring you right where Katniss is. A good story about the human spirit.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I absolutely loved the final book. I wasn't sure what to expect going into it and it sure took me a different route than I would have thought. But I am happy for that because it wasn't the same ole same ole. I don't want to give anything away but the ending is just so shocking but I think very fitting. It's sad to think that there won't be anymore in the series to read. But I am glad to have enjoyed them :)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is freakin awsome I'm a girl I don't usually kill animals but it's awsome I would recommend it to anyone who likes hunting
B0052Z0MJW|5.0|Given this was written a few years ago, Brown was quite visionary in his view of what could transpire in terms of government control of information.  A great read with a nice mix of technology, suspense and romance.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|&#34;Best&#34; New Band to release music in the last couple years.<br />The lead singer has a ton of soul. You can easily see she believes in every single lyric she sings so brilliantly.<br />That can not be taught. She has a gift.<br />As I live band AS is probably 100 times better. Looking forward to the follow-up album and how much the band has grown after touring constantly for 2 years.
B005544V6A|4.0|Upbeat and funny, this dramady pushed all the right buttons for me. It is intelligent, well-written, and well acted. The on-screen chemistry between Macht and Adams is phenomenal. The two play well off of each other, providing episode after episode of witty back and forth that gives the show a depth and reality. Watching the young pup grow some teeth while working to find the Tin Man a heart provides a strong backdrop for the show, bringing continuity to the (generally) case-by-case oriented beginning. The first season started a little slow for my taste, but it built up a good head of steam a few episodes in and carried the momentum through season 2. It is definitely worth a watch.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Great story, this Mini series was great 20 years ago, still is! Very different! Well worth watching! Who killed Laura Palmer!!!
B004GXZ69W|3.0|This will definitely help you if you have wrist pain... till your pinky finger starts going numb in a week or two from your hand wresting on it constantly.<br /><br />I really wish some of the professional reviewers had used the mouse for more than a few days to write their reviews. This is a major flaw and makes the mouse useless.<br /><br />== Update April 12, 2014 ==<br /><br />I just went ahead and started dragging my pinky around instead of wresting my hand on it and it's a much better experience. It took a little getting used to but now I don't really notice my pinky is on my mousepad instead of the mouse.<br /><br />So, I've upped my rating to three stars from one. The only real problem I have now is I constantly hit the back button (it's on the very top of the mouse) when I go to put my hand on the mouse if I'm not looking at it. This is extremely annoying if you've just typed for 10 minutes and your work is gone because you just went \\"back\\" in the browser.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app on my Kindle. I play it nearly every day on my computer but now I can take it with me!
B00007LTIB|5.0|This is one of the classic Yes albums, one of the reasons Yes was a star in not just progressive rock, but on FM radio as well.<br /><br />Theirs is a unique sound. Nobody could really imitate them or their rich tapestries of sound in their recordings -- and shows (which means you must also check out Yessongs).<br /><br />Buy this album. Sit down. Turn down the lights. And listen to this album all the way through. Then do it again. Every time you listen, you will hear more. That's part of the magic of Yes.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It is an incredible story. The ending may be just about the saddest thing on this planet, but that doesn't take away from the quality of the story. It's really well written and throws a few curveballs. It's awesome! I was very much satisfied with this purchase. It made me cry so hard that I couldn't stop shaking, but the fact that it can bring out such emotions is a clear indicator that it's a great read. It doesn't matter if you liked how it ended or not. Just face it, it happens, stories don't always end the way you want them to. I'm hoping for a spinoff series of some sort. I won't say anything more on the subject because I don't want to spoil, but a spinoff series would be totally rocking!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy.  Very surprised ending but satisfying.  I have to keep typing or it won't let me submit
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very addictive. game .but lots of fun . easy to play my grandkids love it also got me started playing
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book is a start, and on the topics it covers, it's quite clear. However, if you're getting into Kindle publishing, you're going to need to buy a better book, or scour the many online blog posts and articles on the topic. Consider this an intro book, only.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A stunning story that shows how simple people, simple things create a tapestry of beauty. Love, friendship and survival are demonstrated against the backdrop of an evil time....and the power of words is shown for both good an evil.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|What an awesome series. More realistic then the 50 Shades Series.  Fantastic read! Highly recommended. Love the characters and can't wait for the next book.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Beautiful, the writing is clever, majestic and leaves you loving the bad guys, or unable to even tell who they are. I loved this book.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck has never impressed me as an actor until Argo. The movie is very well done and Affleck plays his part far better than I expected. Definitely not your typical left-liberal CIA bashing movie.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My granddaughter loves this game.  She is all about Doc McStuffins and this lets her feel as though she is a doc too.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|I have one season left!  The quality of the shoes is fantastic. I would recommend this serious on prime to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The family that plays Minion Rush together stays together.  The whole family enjoys this.  We have one child and he has autism.  This has helped his hand, eye coordination immensely.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a very good tongue-in-cheek spy movie. It is a typical Willis movie, i.e. you can't take it serious but it has good action and is fun to watch. As always Mary-Louise Parker is very good.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|I always liked this game on the computer.  It is nice to have it on the kindle.  My granddaughter is playing it now.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|I found this an interesting read in the way it interwove the story of the'hunter' and the 'hunted'. I have recommended this book to friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had not read this book in quite a while and that made me appreciate this story all over again. The story is rich with deep characters. The action is intense and the decision making process by the characters is intriguing. I am always fascinated by the reasons why people do what the do or how they think. The world would be a much better place if we actually cared about the why behind actions and words. I know that I think differently than most &#34;normal&#34; people and it has been a struggle for me in my career and in several of my personal relationships. I think these struggles make me associate myself with Ender.<br /><br />If you have not read this you really need to. It is not a story about science fiction or even war. This is a story about the human condition, manipulation, self preservation, and moral dilemmas. Let Ender take you on an adventure. I will always love this story of Scott's the most because of how well I relate.
B005EJNAK4|5.0|Bruce Willis was outstanding, the direction and overall production was very good. The story line is very imaginative. Don't rent it… Buy it. You'll want to see it again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like this game BUT I don't like how it tries to get you to pay extra for extra lives, entrance into another level, and assorted other things to help with the game.  The game itself is challenging and a lot of fun.
B009Y6X65C|4.0|exelent work yet again!  continually reestabishing himself as THE modern day keeper and overseeing master of the blues! simply exelent
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A &#34;feel-good&#34; movie with a lesson to be learned.  Cary Grant and the entire cast was perfect.  I love happy endings.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This movie is intense. Edge Of your seat, in your face excitement. I recommend watching this. My pulse was racing. One of the best Zombie movies or there.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is so much fun!  There are many mediums to choose from and I like painting with my fingers. Very creative application!!
1400052181|5.0|Wonderful read. I had to read this for a graduate course, but it was an amazing read. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007L96VCY|5.0|RAM will always be my favorite. I had a party when it first came out and it ended up missing. I bought it again and it's nice to have this newest version.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Dazzling effects and interesting technology concepts. I enjoyed the characters even though several were a bit 2-dimensional. Fun and made me want to be a &#34;pilot&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Candy Crush advertise free and then after you get into it, it stops you for .099 to continue more minutes and and ask for a credit card number.  Not that I dont have the money but don't advertise free if you are not.  It is so muich like Bejewled that I just went and played that and was just as satisfied and it really was FREE!!!
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I did not finish watching. Only made it 1/4 of the way though the movie.<br /> I found it very slow in the beginning and boring. This movie was<br />not what I expected. I give this movie a &#34; D &#34; rating.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a wonderful set of DVDs! The videos are very clear even though they're vintage. I'm sure I'll watch it many times because it's easy to miss something.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I loved this one.  Lots of surprises. Really good characters who you actually care about.  All in all a great ride.
B002RVCD46|4.0|Look, we love this movie and we love the ability to watch the film anytime we're online via amazon. BUT the picture quality is pretty abysmal for much of the time and even with newly improved internet service at home, the film stops multiple times to re-load or whatever that's called. Amazon: Please invest in making the picture quality better on the instant view films!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really enjoy playing Bingo Blitz , I enjoy the slots and bingo connection but lose tokens often in slots. The bingo portion is good about replacing lost credits due to connection loss but the slots portion do not replace or award tokens with the loss of internet connection. All in all super fun game I want to play often.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Absolute hilarious classic farce.  Great sight gags. Michael Keaton is brilliant and I can't wait for the sequel! The entire cast was into making this as it shows in one hilarious, fall on the floor in fits of hysterical laughter.
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|It's pretty good if you ask me. But you can't change the color like what you see in the photos. It's pretty good overall.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but I have never not liked anything that Patricia Cornwell wrote.  Just haven't had the time to catch up on my reading.  But take my word for it, she never has a bad book
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After readin the previous books, I finally recognize the caracters with out hesitation, and that makes the reading more easy
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great plot and surprise ending. Gets your attention from the start. Another Grisham hit! This book is one to pass on to friends.
159562015X|3.0|This used copy was missing the code needed to take the StrengthsFinder test online to get the results needed to use this book, so it was a pretty pointless purchase.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|A Godzilla vs the machines update? The monsters weren't in rubber suits and the dialog wasn't dubbed but thats about the only difference.  However, like Godzilla it was fun to watch.  Glad I viewed via streaming video vice buying the disc.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|this book was amazing I just wished they would of had a baby or something!!<br />can't wait to start reading another Sylvia Day novel
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Been reading this with our oldest Granddaughter.  Story line is riveting, there are some good lessons to be learned and the content is acceptable for her age.  She commented that she is comfortable discussing the book with me because there isn't anything that she finds embarrassing.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This book is as good as the first Grisham's novel &#34;Time to kill&#34;. Can't wait for the new 2014's novel!!!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|Incredibly insightful.  This book gives simple very easy too use guidelines.  After reading this book it is easy to understand why start ups fail.  This book will will equip any start up in avoiding those pitfalls.
B0096MM9GG|1.0|SO STUPID I MEAN I ALWAYS DIE I'M STUCK ON A LEVEL AND BAD GRAPHICS ON THIS GAME I THINK IT'S 0 STAR!! DON'T GET THIS GAME!!
B00G32ND76|5.0|One of Trejo's best, playing the &#34;Bad Ass Mexican&#34; Great shoot'em up, revenge, make a deal with the devil flick. Killer body count, fun action, Western the way we always wished they could be, or maybe really were! Highly recommend, fun evening of movie watching!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game. Pass time quickly. I haven't figured out the strategy yet so it is still challenging. This is a sweet addiction.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Love all these books and movies! It was a big surprise to know that mark had died since he was a big part in both books.
B005HED08I|1.0|Picture quality is very poor. This needs to be re-mastered for watch on native 4K Ultra High Definition Televisions. This series has so much more to give in picture quality from it's film elements.
0920668364|5.0|An awesome tale, great book for new pregnant mom's and one children will remember growing up hearing.  Great gift idea.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good game , excellent human interface great work! very good game . boys age 5 & 8 like it very much. i find the game very addictive. it is good to have timer & time on the dash board. try to control each session not longer than 10 -15 min.<br />also getting a time out of the game should be made easier, at the moment you need to pull down 2 times from the top of the screen<br />to get out of the game into the phone home screen.
0316204366|5.0|Revelatory book, great writing, unlikely page turner, learned something new. Consistent with Gladwell's other insightful and unique take on seeing what's there that we miss.
B001DTTG16|1.0|Picture quality is very poor. This needs to be re-mastered for watch on native 4K Ultra High Definition Televisions. This movie has so much more to give in picture quality from it's film elements.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great reading great story line and mystery.This could very well be a true story.unfortunately  this is what happened in American and is apart of our history. It shows how some people became rich at the expense of others. It saddens my heart to think of the suffering the African-Americans endured.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|So-so. I don't want to go through 4 steps to set the alarm. I don't know why it's set up that way.
0143058525|4.0|A catchy story and since I have spent time with her Guru I can attest to the accuracy of her reporting about her time in the Ashram.  But that aside Gilbert spins a good tale.
0743270754|5.0|Enormously rewarding reading giving life to a theme supposedly exploited to death. A full era of great and/or big men appears lively and convincingly making us to think, for comparison, about the tiny size ans shape of contemporary leaders
B008C20TDG|4.0|The concept seems absolutely right. However, I can see that it would be almost impossible to do this for any length of time. I plan to attempt it for at least 30 days & evaluate it. Well written.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It's a great story that I fell in love with from book one, and I'm overall happy with this ending. However, I will say that the dual points of view could have been done much better, as there isn't much difference in the writing style for each one. I think Veronica Roth is very strong in Tris's voice, but equally weak in Four's voice. I do think the story has some important messages (though some are written very heavy-handedly). Despite its shortcomings, it was a compelling read, and a satisfying end.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Whoa!  Where did this series come from and how come I never heard of it?  And why in the world isn't it still on television?  Well I've heard of it now and what's more I'll never forget &#34;Firefly&#34; because I'm going to dust off the DVD's every once in a while and revisit this bunch of great, and ultimately loveable, misfits.
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|The free version has an exit button, but this one does not? WTF? This needs an update with the same ability to exit quickly whenever I want.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel never stopped the surprises!  You thought you had a handle on what was happening, and the author just threw you another curve.  Amazing twists and turns in the plot.  The characters were clearly thought out and really drew the reader into the story.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|I downloaded this game for my 5 year old, but I've been testing it out and I think it's pretty fun. You have to time how fast/slow your roller coaster goes to finish the track and continue on with the game. It can be a little tricky, just takes some timing. I actually think it's hilarious when the roller coaster crashes and all the fluffies go flying everywhere. I also like the &quot;wheeeeee&quot; noises the fluffies make when they ride the coaster! Tee hee.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Always thought serial killers are scum but I kinda like having Dexter around just to even things out, balance the bad with the...whatever.
B00D2CYU2W|2.0|I hoped it would be about Liberace's brillant career as a consummate entertainer.  I wasn't one bit interested in his homosexual relationship.<br />What a waste of time!  Becky
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is an excellant app for sincere Bible readers. Compares other Bible translations with New world Translation ,and all use God's name Jehovah
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|EG is a beautiful writer, an amazing researcher, and weaves a tale of interest and intrigue with fascinating and compelling characters. And such beautiful use of our misused language. Thanks for the adventure, Ms Gilbert!
B0026P3G12|4.0|&#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; is the way Susan Boyle sings it is the greatest, some of her other stuff, not so great.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Another great season for this show. Ideas of faith, reason, and truth explored. And continued development the characters stories, there aren't many shows that have such deeply defined characters.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|This is is a really cool physics-based game. It sort of reminds me of games like Blosics, Civiballs, and Wake Up the Box from onemorelevel.com, which are all physics and timing-based games.<br /><br />Your goal for this game is to defend King Oddball's territory by hitting the enemies with boulders. You get three tries per level, and if you hit three or more enemies with one boulder, you get an extra try for that level. You can also hit the platforms and either knock them over onto an enemy or knock the enemy off the platform. There are also explosive boxes which can be hit to take out a platform or kill multiple enemies at once.<br /><br />Once you get to the second round of levels, you can unlock the achievements hall. There are 16 achievements to unlock that have to do with hitting multiple enemies with one boulder, completing all of the levels or all of a certain type of level, and even ones that have to do with hitting the king (and even killing him!). There are also levels where you can collect diamonds, as well as a hidden mustache level, which both have achievements for collection and completion.<br /><br />Things I like about this game:<br /><br />- Great unique game (+2 stars)<br />- Achievements system adds replay value and difficulty (+1 star)<br />- Good graphics and sound (+1 star)<br />- No intrusive permissions (+1 star)<br /><br />Things I don't like about this game:<br /><br />- Repetitive gameplay (-1/2 star)<br />- Back button only leads to pause menu, no clean exit (which apparently is not in the latest version of this game) (-1/2 star)<br /><br />Total: 4/5 stars<br /><br />Recommended: Yes<br /><br />- Sam<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Okay, there is a lot more to this game that I've discovered since playing through this morning. There are other challenge mode levels you can play through, like the diamond hall and the grenade levels. There is also a place in the fourth territory to chat with the king (it's a telephone icon). I think you have tofigure out what to say to the king in order to unlock something, but I haven't figured out anything about that...yet. If anyone has figured that out, please let me know in the comments.<br /><br />- Sam
015603008X|5.0|My loveliest fiction book ever. I returned to it at least 10 times, and felt excited every time. I give it to all those people whom I love.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|He may be a cold-blooded, heartless, murdering sociopath.  But he's a good cold-blooded, heartless, murdering sociopath and never fails to entertain and if that isn't enough you end up in his corner pulling for him.  How in the world did the producers of this show pull that off.  Ya gotta watch it to find out.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I purchased this early in the year and was very exited at first. When I would use it there was a long lag before I could see anything on the TV (15-20 sec). Additional, some of the content was choppy at times. The app did what it said it would do albeit poorly. The version I used last was iMediaShare HD not the current Flipps HD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I honestly love this app! It is fun and at times challenging! Flow Free app is awesome that I am addicted to it!
B00CHVJI08|5.0|My family loved this movie. It was so funny and one the whole family could enjoy. I could see it again and again!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Always thought serial killers are scum but I kinda like having Dexter around just to even things out, balance the bad with the...whatever.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This is a really good story, but it could be shorter! The subject of an orphaned child surviving against great odds is one that draws you in, the mystery of the painting ties it all together.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Very fun to play.  Graphics are excellent.  Frustrating that ha have to buy new weapons and equipment.<br />Would recommend to a lot of friends..
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Your mind tells you \\"this is fiction\\"'.  Your \\"reader's eye\\" asks, \\"how can this be so specific, so precise, so seemingly real?\\"  Now, I am not a \\"Zombie Apocalypse\\" follower, but, after reading WORLD WAR Z, I am a Max Brooks' follower !  The use of personal interviews with those who have lived through the Zombie war, and their experiences during the fighting and the rebuilding of their homelands makes the story leap off the pages.  I could not put this book down.  No, I don't believe the dead might ever \\"reanimate\\", but, just in case, it's good to know you have to go for the brain, because their bodies can \\"take a lickin', and keep on tickin'\\".
B00006CXSS|5.0|Whoa, Steven Spielberg doing a TV show?  This has got to be the biggest mismatch in TV history.  Guess again, it's not.  Even beats the pants off some of his movies.  Instead of blowing up in his face instead it's TV history with Spielberg producing the best miniseries ever.  Edge of your seat the whole way.  But Spielberg's going to pull a few punches since it's TV right?  Guess again.  This is first class TV, and first class history, and first class drama, and first class action, and first class epic adventure.  Do not miss this show!!!
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|The description of the item goes out of its way not to make clear that the DVD isn't a video of the 1971 performance. Such trickery is unworthy of the Band. Deeply disappointing.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Exactly what I needed to perform every day math calculations such as balancing my checkbook, figuring gratuities , tracking my budget, etc.
B009POHHRG|5.0|A great comic which is definitely worth it's reputation, the images are clear and the portrayals are excellent, well then what are you waiting for, go BUY IT
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|The first half hour is awesome! Hot chick and a great plane crash! The rest of the movie just about his chemical depdependencies. Kinda boring.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Hard to put down.  Gave me much to think about in art and life.  Knowing that the Goldfinch was in New York made it less suspenseful.
B0018M6J90|5.0|some Incredibly great Lines are contained in this movie.<br />it's Life, Love, and romance.<br />- in the highest form.<br /><br />what You're Left with at the end; is the recognition of gentility within Yourself.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Awesome best game about thor yet, missions are kind of hard though, best be up for it. Also very nice graphics and cool and realistic powers
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Having never seen the series while broadcast and just visiting England...I loved it.  I think the actors are terrific and the story is believable.  Love Maggie Smith.  sorry to see the end.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was a great ending to a great series. The whole series was a lot of fun to read. I would highly recommend it.
6304493681|4.0|Was a great movie, but was kinda slow and didn't explain much. I went into this knowing nothing about the series, but not bad for 1996. This was pretty impressive. Maybe the story was a little too complex for me, but the action scenes were well done! So I guess I would recommend try watching the tv series before this movie.
1250038820|5.0|Incredible !<br />This is such a fantastic book - you can read it over a month ever night & be inspired. Thanks Brandon!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am a huge fan of Veronica Roth's work and I found Divergent to be amazing.  I could not put divergent down and I never wanted the book to end.  And that's why Allegiant is so disappointing.  Divergent and Insurgent kept me wanting more and I read chapters at a time.  With Allegiant, however, I found it difficult to read past the first 5 pages.  It is so slow and boring and not at all what I expected.  My expectations for the third book in the trilogy were maybe too high due to how much I enjoyed the first two.  I'm so sad to be giving Allegiant two stars out of five, but I could not bring myself to finish the first chapter, let alone the book.  Very disappointed :(
B00ENXBUR2|1.0|This is just further confirmation of the downfall of the American Movie. The JJ Abrams crowd has taken over and the story behind a movie is no longer in any way relevant. The new Star Trek is not fit to even be compared to the wrath of khan, why, NO STORY! The story here was no good either. There are now thousands of kryptonians still running around so no need for clark to feel alone, oh wait there is no clark kent in this movie. They also have lots of space ships and can cruise the galaxy at will. In fact apparently superman holds the key to rebuilding the entire Kryptonian race. Add to the horrible script the Incredibly horrible direction and editing and this movie ranks among my least favorite comic book movies of all time. Half the time I couldn't even see what was happening. I know at one point without explanation some robot creatures are trying to kill him but you really couldn't see any of it. The acting was good I will give them that and that's about all. This guy and JJ Abrams should be struck from directing any more films. JJ Abrams will kill Star Wars too, the only thing he has going for him there is he cant do any worse than those last three movies written by George Lucas kids.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game!  I've purchased 3 so I have them all going at the same time.  No getting bored with this game!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|I Loved this movie it Kept Me on the edge of my seat Edward Norton is fantastic we all ready know Richard gear not only good-looking is also fantastic
B007Q476KU|5.0|Excellent movie. Watched it more than once. It is a great drama with a sad story but have to see.
B00FWLSOOG|4.0|Pic and audio perfect down side took a min to load the video when connected Stright to the internet all in all great video
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Yea Yea Yea... its great that this is out.  But just to be clear, there are no songs on this album that being released for the first time.  Heavy Duty Beatle fans have been listening to all this material for decades.  Google &#34;Beatles at the BEEB&#34;.  Having said that, the BBC material is the ABSOLUTE BEST source for hearing what the Fab Four really sounded like.  NO multi-track and NO screaming fans..... FANTASTIC material.
0152465073|1.0|I bought this book looking for the Katherine Woods translation... Heads: this isn't it! The print quality of the illustrations is pretty substandard too.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|Lots of action but so very little dialogue and the dialogue that was provided was truncated and sometimes just meaningless. I did enjoy the last scenes on the moors of Scotland since it reminded me of the location of the home of Ian Fleming. I am not looking forward to more 007.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|This game is so addicting, it is hard to put it down. Loved the first one and<br />completely addicted to the second one. Keep them coming. Do not like the<br />pop up though, is annoying, but since the game is so much fun,<br />I guess I have no choice but to put up with it.
1743117094|2.0|Which editor thought it ok to give a character the name Lol?  Who in this day and age can read that without thinking, \\"Lots of laughs\\" over and over again?<br /><br />A friend recommended this book highly and I gave it my best shot. There are some gripping moments, but there is also so much time given to pensive thoughts that it's hard not to feel very impatient. The sisters all seem like huge stereotypes. There is no one character to make an emotional connection to. It's frustrating that each time they are close to finding out the \\"truth,\\" something interferes, delaying the plot even further.<br /><br />I ended up skimming to the end. It was starting to feel like the author had placed the mom on the literary version of life support to drag things out so her children could have time to solve the puzzle.<br /><br />The twist at the end was very clever---but it also felt like readers had spent so little time with Vivien (vs. Dolly) that we never really got to know her in the first place. I think this could make an interesting movie if someone chose to focus on the key points and gave the friends equal air time. The book, however, has far too much filling.  Two stars.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|I enjoy the sixth season because I like the character of Jonas Quinn. This season also includes half a dozen of my favorite episodes. If you like the story arcs, this season moves them forward. (I think this is the first season in which the writers really focused on the story arcs.)<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />Don't worry, you do get to see Daniel Jackson a couple of times.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Well written and suspenseful. Did not like the end. Fans of the series may say that it was the logical conclusion but I think it could have been ended better.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I only laughed out loud maybe three times, which is unusual for a Sophie Kinsella book. I liked the story overall but I didn't like that she made it seem like saving yourself for marriage is ridiculous and you'll make a bad decision because you're so horny. As someone who waited for my wedding night, this is wrong and a little offensive. It would be nice to have a different perspective on this matter. Other than the lack of laughs and misconstruing my beliefs it was a fun quick read with an interesting story line.
B009BWGQRE|5.0|had me on the edge of my seat!  One of the best true adventure movies I've seen.  Highly recommend this movie.
B00F56AZK4|4.0|These were fun while they lasted.  I'm finished now and wish there were more in this series.  These companies should just keep supplying new puzzles.  You run through them pretty quickly if you are as obsessed as I am.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I really loved this book. It was interesting to read from start to finish. Everyone should read this harrowing tale.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I Really enjoy this show and will not waste my time on an ok series. I like how you get into the lives of many of the characters and the twists and turns.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't think I would like this show, but after the 1st episode I was hooked! I highly recommend it
B009D3CTVS|5.0|I tried installing the driver that came in the box on Windows 8.1, but no go. I went to Roland's website, downloaded the newest driver, 1.0.2, and it installed without a problem.

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|In this last book of the trilogy, we are given a micro view of what it means to live in a nation decimated by a war waged and lost against the rest of the world. The Hinterberger's are a proud family living in Heimkirchen, Germany, farming land that has been in the family for a while and running the local inn, The Black Eagle. All the problems that can beset a country in turmoil are seen in this family.<br /><br />Desperate to own the family properties, Anna drives her brother off. When her father dies, Anna inherits everything and becomes the family matriarch. With her husband off at war, Anna runs everything to suit herself. Unable to have children of her own, she takes in young family members and raises them. She has taken in the propaganda and is a strict xenophobic. She refuses to hire anyone not from her own part of Germany. Religious differences cause strife within the extended family. Relative is pitted against relative in the belief that one or the other will inherit this or that portion of the Hinterberger properties.<br /><br />Underhanded dealings provide luxury items for the restaurant at a time when they could not otherwise be afforded, and the family prospers. Much like the country at large, the various members of the family are doing what they must to survive and ensure they receive what they believe they are due for their efforts. Underhanded dealings, trickery, poison, creating false documents are all part and parcel of trying to rebuild and survive in the aftermath of a war that leaves many Germans ashamed.<br /><br />The struggles of trying to survive in a country attempting to rebuild itself and regain respectability as the horrors of its leaders is made public is both heartrending and poignant. Families are torn apart and brought back together. Once again, Fischer has brought to life a world that most of us today weren't alive to witness, and done so eloquently. His characters come to life in a way that draws you into the story. You have to feel for them; he leaves you no choice. Whether those feelings are sadness, disgust, compassion, you must feel.<br /><br />From a quiet farm to a family and country rising from the ashes back into respectability, Fischer handles everything with a deftness I've come to expect from his writing. Having read all of the books in the Three Nations Trilogy, it is obvious Fischer is passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subjects of which he writes. His characters are well developed as they are in the other books.<br /><br />Although the narrative moves slow and is detailed, I believe this is necessary for the reader to fully understand what the family, and in a broader view, Germany itself, is going through. Luck of the Weissensteiners, Sebastian, and The Black Eagle Inn show us a better view of Germany during this time period than any history book I ever read in school. No history can be complete that ignores the citizens of the country being studied. Fischer has done an excellent job filling in important blanks in my own education, for which I give him thanks. This book, and in fact the entire trilogy are thought-provoking, requiring you to question what you thought you knew and understood. You have to feel something. Can any book be ignored that does that?<br /><br />I was gifted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Holiday fare with the feisty zest of the Piano Guys, mixed in with a nice selection of lavish video productions.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great fun, I would recommend this game. Hidden objects are a challenge but fun to find and with zoom it's even better.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Fun game that is action packed and with good, responsive controls.  A game that is full of a great humour.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The controversy, in my mind minor, that surrounded this film upon release shed great light upon the affection so many have for Superman - or at least, how dear THEIR idea of Superman is.  Yet the concept behind Man Of Steel is not one that allows the revisiting of the same exact Superman from Donner's films or the one that many grew up with.  That's not to say that this Superman does not share the values of that Superman - he does.  Yet Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan are more interested in HOW he got to that point and how the world would truly react if a superpowered being lived among us.  There's a reason why massive destruction happens when Kal-El fights - because he is THAT powerful.  Frankly, I'm not sure that any superhero has the overall power of Superman.  It is his power that also makes him most interesting.  For years, Superman has been seen as a mere Boy Scout.  He does the right thing.  He's the good guy.  But why?<br /><br />Let's think about this.  If you were the most powerful person on the planet, capable of taking out whole military detachments by yourself, would you SERVE humanity or decide to DOMINATE it?  The most amazing thing about Superman is his CHOICE to serve, not to control.  We have so often taken this aspect of the character for granted, yet the filmmakers delve into this superbly.  At the heart of the reason are Martha and Jonathon, played superbly by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.  It is through their love and care of young Clark that he matures and becomes Superman.<br /><br />There are so many things to praise here, from the score to the plot to the pacing to the effects.  It is also worth noting that the screenwriter has stated that the destruction will be an issue in the second film and is also a reason why people do not fully trust Superman.<br /><br />If you can, separate yourself from the past.  Christopher Reeve was wonderful in his day, but this is not that Superman.  It is the modern Superman that lives in a more complex world that would not embrace him unthinkingly.<br /><br />Henry Cavill is also wonderful here, as is the entire cast.  Frankly, this movie doesn't miss a beat at all.  And the Special Features with the Blu-Ray reveal even more.  There are many things that I thought were not special effects that were.  The amount of detail the set and design was given is incredible.  You can just see the love so many had for this project.<br /><br />With Man Of Steel, Superman soars like never before.  This film will tug on your heart strings, cause you to cheer, and let you look in wonder at Superman once more.  It is the greatest of the modern slew of comic book films, surpassing even the wonderful The Dark Knight and far exceeding anything done by Marvel (and most of that HAS been quite good).

B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Well made game with a lot of options and replay value.  Very deep game that is also a challenging jaunt.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best book I have ever had the fortune to read. Growing up in Germany right after WWII, I remember my parents and grandparents talking about the air raids, often 2 or 3 of them in the same day. The protagonist is described vividly and real; her fate not unlike several persons I knew in my lifetime. It is a great book for all ages starting with pre-teens. I plan to order the hard back copy for my granddaughter.
B00FI7XBIS|1.0|Not very good... More of a game for kids...I installed it.. Then immediately un-installed...Just not for me at all...Maybe others will like it...
B00594XOZU|5.0|Please please bring it back to kindle fire :( i used it everyday and it was so much faster than texting! Please bring it back
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use and great selection.<br />My local library has ebooks and this works flawlessly with the kindle.<br />You cannot go wrong with Kindle
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Really enjoyed the whole series. I couldn't put this book down the whole time I was reading it. I thought the ending was good for the characters.
0062255657|5.0|This is an absolutely exciting, terrifying, fascinating, and wondrous tale.  Neil Gaiman is masterful and has never been better. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves exceptional writing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun to play it is great and you can play for hours and hours you can have lots of fun
B00FGM0JTY|5.0|Being a music documentary nut, I loved it on many levels. Being a relatively knowledgeable music nut, I thought I knew the story of Muscle Shoals, but there is a great amount of information and great music from the historic studios. The quality of this film lies in the list of superstars who were willing to give their time to share their love of Muscle Shoals: Jagger, Richards, Aretha, Winwood, Allman, plus many of the Swampers and Rick Hall, whose attention to detail brought that &#34;greasy&#34; sound (as Aretha called it) from these recordings, dripping with soul. Great stories, well-made film.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie, a bit different than the book, although for the most part followed the plot and story well.  Both kids watched movie as well, one that didn't read the book: really liked the movie.  the other that read the book: didn't like the movie.  Overall, I definitely enjoyed the movie and hope the sequels will be as good or better.
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|Heard one of her songs on Pandora so I bought the album. I really love her sound, the combination of electronica and violin are perfect. Only gave it 4 stars because a lot of the tracks do sound very similar.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good game graphics are good get the game and free you  Can play with without no muse have this but this cost money things come on get the game already
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is awesome the graphics are good it has a great story to go with it.  I really enjoyed playing this game and I highly recommend it to.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Great Classic movie.  Watched it with my son and he enjoyed it as well some 25 years after I first watched it when I was his age.
0743298020|5.0|You must read this book!  It is so intriguing and suspenseful. The ending alone is worth the price of the book.  It leaves you thinking about the children for weeks- months later!! Enjoy!!
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|It was ok !<br />The plot was at first ok , but as it went on ... It lost its sparks
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice item when used with your Chrome Browser to view internet on your Smart TV.  Love it.  You will too.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Starting to like the album more and more as i continue to listen.  I miss The Rev's influence on the music though, for me...can tell he was an extremely important part of their music's direction, sound, style and substance.  I have enjoyed the Riffs from the first time I bought this album, the lyrics simply didn't seem as powerful as some of their earlier albums like &#34;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&#34; and &#34;City of Evil&#34; however, are starting to grow on me, especially &#34;Shepherd of Fire&#34; and &#34;Acid Rain&#34;.  All in all, A7X still kicks ass and my hope is they continue to rock out for some time with the core of M. Shadows, Zacky V, Synyster and Johnny.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Bought as a portion of a silent auction gift basket for a raffle/ fundraiser. Hopefully, there are still a few people in my community who do not yet own it.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Contains songs unique to this album from one of the best singer-songwriters of his time.  You can't find him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,so you need to surf Amazon instead. The Rock and Roll Hall of fame is no longer &#34;Miles From Nowhere,&#34; it is almost there.<br /><br />Cat Steven (now Yusaf) is one of the most prolific singer songwriters of all time, despite not recording for many years.  Judge this from the large number of other performers who have recorded his songs.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It would be perfect except the programming of buttons through the drivers leaves some to be desired and the mouse wheel squeaks. Anker support was really spacey when I reported that the weights failed to come with the mouse - they sent me the wrong ones twice because they couldn't figure out what mouse I had until I gave them pictures.
1401938906|5.0|Very interesting and love the way science and faith are combined. Have not tried the experiments yet but combining them with prayer would be my way to do it.
0446310786|5.0|Bought as a portion of a gift basket for a fundraiser/ gift raffle.  Hopefully everyone in my community does not yet have it or wants this copy with the terrific cover!
B00DSS7B0S|5.0|Great collection of performances and PA announcements at the Woodstock event.  The performances vary dramatically in musical style, musical perfection and levels of audience excitement, but all were recorded live at an human event, the likes of which may never be repeated.  This is the way to experience Woodstock and you did not have the opportunity to attend in person.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Wonderful. The character &#34;Rick&#34;, played by Bogart, doesn't appear to very virtuous at first, but we discover that he is a tower of virtue at the end. Inspiring. The unfolding plot surprises you all the way.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|It was a good pace movie.  Answers some of the questions from other Marvel movies and links the series Agents of  S.H.I.EL.D.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Too glib.  Banter detracted from action and made it seem like a joke.  Not a very plausable<br /> story line.  Especially the lawn chase.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Wow!  This movie blew me away when I saw it and was very sorry I had miss.ed it in the theaters.  I don't normally give two flips about blu-ray or 3D but I HAD to see this movie on our 3D screen.  This movie was gorgeous and the higher def and 3D effects were appropriate.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the book series and enjoyed this movie.  It didn't change too much from the book.  Another fast paced movie.  I wanted to watch this before the next movie comes out Nov. 22.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Waste of money.  Unfortunately I purchased this with much anticipation only to regret the wasted time I spent reading it. Can you return a kindle book that was horrible? I'm going to try. The first book was good. The second was almost as good. The story should have ended there.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think this book really caught the isolation of those who are different. What a &#34;wonder&#34;ful evolution of a freak to a normal little boy and his world around him. We need to keep compassion and acceptance a high priority in our life
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Watched this movie after watching Thor.  The movie is linked to the movie Thor and the Avengers.  Watch the movies from Marvel in order of release.  If you are watching the series Agents of SHIELD you'll enjoy this movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've played several big fish games and this one is definitely at the top of the list. Not boring and I was hooked.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Solid movie with good action.  However, total expierence was uninspiring - but still enjoyable.  Solid 3 star.  Good movie - but not great.
B003F29D44|4.0|Great film, it was used in my MBA class to discuss &#34;gray&#34; areas in business decisions. This film makes it very clear where you can go wrong but it points out how easy it is for business professionals to make the a decision that seem fine but are actually unethical.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As all books in the Hunger Games Trilogy, I thought this was was simply a great book. Loved them all.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A great novel. Unusual narrator. Characters are great. I am going to see the film soon, but I do not know how they could film this story<br />without loosing the essence of it.
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|visually dull (B&W).  Old story, new characters, but I didn't find anything redeeming about these new characters.  The men looked pretty much the same to me, which made it hard to follow.  I would not call this sexy in the slightest.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Not being a fan of this genre, I began watching because my wife wanted to see it. Although I was on the cusp at first, the superb acting, interesting story lines and quirkiness of the series held my interest. I was extremely surprised at Jessica Lange's acting capabilities...who would have thought she had it in her to be so creepy and menacing. She was extremely good, as were the other actors.The series is a little confusing at first, but once you get into it, it all makes sense. in all, it was quite good with many highly unexpected twists. Quite a bit of violence and gore, but also sprinkled with amusing moments. Well worth watching, and totally different than anything else on television.
1451668945|5.0|I've been a Mary Higgins Clark fan for 20+ years and she never disappoints. I enjoyed this book as much as I've enjoyed any of her others.
B008J8KBKY|3.0|The graphics are not that crisp so as the board gets filled it's difficult to track where you put your marker.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Just disappointed! The first two books, Divergent and Insurgent drew me in. Roth did a good job of mapping out the factions. So it was a complete let down to find out how depressing and terribly written Allegient was. The characters had no voice. Caleb, Christina and Uriah became one sentence characters who faded into the background. Tobias was confused and Tris..I don't want to spoil the book,  but I will say I wish Roth had developed the characters and storyline better in this book. She could have done so much more ....the book was just depressing and poorly written.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very excited for the release of this final book in the Divergent trilogy.  However, I found this book to be a major disappointment and that had nothing to do with the controversial death. This book felt rushed and I do not feel Veronica Roth did a service to the characters she created.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I loved this version of Emma! I will agree with another reviewer that the actress who plays Emma looked a little too modern at times for this era. Her hair was that of the 90's, whereas everyone else fit in well with the movie. I think the characters were chosen fairly well,<br /><br />Mr. Knightly was a little young, especially considering how much older he is than Emma in the book.<br />Mr. Woodhouse was played PERFECTLY. By far the best depiction of this character I have seen yet, it was spot on.<br />Mr. Elton wasn't nearly creepy enough and seemed much for remorseful about his choice in a wife than I expected.<br /><br />Overall, a GREAT depiction of the film. Definitely worth watching.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Good story,  great action and graphics. Different version of Star Trek,  The wrath of Khan. Also has 3d, dvd and digital copy versions.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|An amazing tv show that should never have been canceled is worth almost any price. If you love the Stargate series and Battlestar Galactica this one is for you.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This doctor tells it like it is.  Everyone should read this book.  One would realize how dangerous gluten is to the brain.
B00E1SJDJG|5.0|A great album. I use it to put my son to sleep. Bill did it again, and even better than the last one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wonderful read. Couldn't put it down. Intense from first page to last. A true grisham style mistery. I loved it.
B00571F26Y|3.0|It started off interesting but the more I looked into his eating methods the more I saw that it wasnt for me. I dont have an intolerance to gluten and Im not giving up some of the foods I love. I generally only moderately eat wheat anyway.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie, it's cheesy and a getting a bit old but it's just so much fun around Halloween!<br />The acting isn't exactly world class but it's still delightfully exuberant and funny. It makes for a great family Halloween tradition.<br />There are one or two scenes that aren't exactly for toddlers but in context they are ok.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|This is easily one of the top television shows on the tube today. Great acting, superb writing. It just keeps getting better and better.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Best Iron Man yet!!! Tons of action. Great special effects. If you like to sit back and be entertained, then this movie is for you!!
B000AP04FG|5.0|I ordinarily do not enjoy films of this sort-- violent, non-stop-action, high body-count, little else.  However this film adds something to the mix that makes it a winner:  the chemistry of Pitt and Jolie along with an excellent script that is hilarious.  From the beginning to the end it keeps the viewer entertained and the ending is both unexpected and perfect.  At first I wasn't even going to see it in the theater.  Now it's in my home collection.  That gives you some idea as to its unique presentation.  My favorite line in the movie (you'll just have to see it):  &#34;We're going to talk about this when we get home!&#34;
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Enjoyed the story.  Didn't think I would, so was pleasantly surprised. Liked Jennifer Lawrence a lot.  May even watch the next one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It did not take long before I was invested in each character. Their development was superb.<br />It had just enough twists and turns to make it hard to put down.<br />Would like to read more about Jake, Lettie, and Portia.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|LOL!  This is the best book and even all your other books are best, too! Awesome! From a secret friend, Kagen.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Daniel Washington does his usual brilliant job of acting in this story of a pilot that is an alcoholic and drinks and uses cocaine before a flight. The aircraft has a mechanical failure and the character in the movie is such a talented pilot that he does an unorthodox maneuver to save the lives of the passengers on board despite his condition. Unfortunately, a tox screen is mandatory after the crash landing.  The ending is unfortunate but inevitable. Excellent movie, I just wish it could end better.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I think this is one of the most beneficial ways to start learning a language aside from actually taking a class.  It is a great alternative for those who don't have time to do it formally.  And it is fun to do, so I get excited about learning the language.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Amazing storytelling! I love all of Liane's books so far but this might be my favorite next to The Hypnotist's Love Story!
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|Just  as good as the first monsters movie. Great for the kids and for the parents. Highly recommend this movie
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This review is directed towards Eminem fans, particularly those who may have stopped listening to him because of their dissatisfaction with his recent albums.<br /><br />I've been a huge stan since The Slim Shady LP.  To be honest, the only Eminem CD I thought was mediocre was Encore.  I like Relapse and Recovery.  But I know a lot of people were disappointed with all three. Out of Encore, Relapse, Recovery, and MMLP2, MMLP2 is easily the best.  This album is a love letter to the fans that got hooked on his first three (not including Infinite) albums.  If you loved this first three albums but didn't get into his most recent stuff, give this a chance.  If you love hip-hop, give this a chance.  After my first listen, I would have given this album a 7 or 8 out of 10.  I've listened to this album front to back ~20 times and have no hesitation giving it a 9.5 or 10 out of 10.  Listen to the lyrics.  The wordplay, multiple meanings, metaphors, story telling, etc. is incredible.  You don't find this kind of artistry in other albums.  Multiple listens are rewarded.  Check it out.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|It was a long dragged out move and did not live up to it's hype. Not what I expected at all..
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn has introduced me to an author I find inspirational and whose skill in the craft of storytelling is awe inspiring.  At every turn of the page I was pulled into the world of her multi-layered characters and given a room by room tour of the spaces inside their heads.  I am a huge fan of character based fiction and for that reason Gone Girl was a great read for me.<br /><br />The situation within the novel, and the thing that is Amy and Nick’s relationship, which itself becomes something of a character within the story, is rather relatable.  It appeals to that ever present question tumbling around inside the minds of anyone in a serious relationship, “What is going on inside this persons head?”  Flynn deftly manipulates and conquers this simple question into an epic adventure through this fictional liaison.  I certainly won’t get into the plot at all; I will only say I found it very engaging.<br /><br />The standout character is definitely Amy.  Flynn has eloquently captured the essence of her lead female character’s internal monologue, the way her thoughts are processed, feelings dissected and important pieces of information filed away for use at a poignant time in the future.  Flynn, in an often too close for comfort manner, illustrates the pivotal difference between the internal processing of the female mind verses its male counterpart.<br /><br />While there are several very clever elements within this piece of fiction, there are a couple that stood out to me which I can discuss without revealing the plot.  As I mentioned above Flynn presents an interesting image of the male vs. female take on the same relationship.  What I found interesting was the way Flynn uses her secondary female characters.  While each of them are well crafted and serve their purposes in the chain of events, none of them shine quite as bright as Amy, which is a great tool for accentuating the bold aspects of her character.<br /><br />I also appreciated thewriting about writing elements within the story.  Amy’s diary is very effective as a plot device and was worked into the story in a very crafty way.  The fact that the character of Amy in Gone Girl is actually the inspiration for the character of Amazing Amy, a heroine of a collection of children’s books within the novel, is another indication of Flynn’s ingenious fiction writing.<br /><br />This is a smart and wily story with several surprises and exquisitely imagined characters.  I truly had a lot of fun reading Gone Girl and several times throughout felt like I was listening in on a great piece of juicy gossip!  So for all you Book Gossips out there – this is a must read!
B008602KQI|2.0|Eighteen year olds killing eight year old. A mix of Mad Max and Steampunk. Not worth seeing. What h cartoons.
0307341550|5.0|Literally  - crazy good!!  Gillian Flynn is a master at character development.  You feel as though you know these people and her words create movies in your mind.  And the plot has so many twists and turns you don't see the end coming.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Started reading it in the afternoon and then could not stop. Had to finish it before i went to bed. This book applies to anybody and is not just about August. Teaches you that it takes Courage, unconditional love and Kind(er)ness to overcome any emotional challenges in life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|what took kindle so long? great game great graphics. plays seamlessly now have on pc/facebook and iphone and kindle. highly recommend
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Almost done - can hardly put it down.  I read every John Grisham book as it comes out.  This might be my favorite!!
B003YL4L0W|4.0|Sing You Home annoyed me on multiple levels, none of which had to do with the structure or writing. I have great compassion for my friends who are attracted to their same sex. It's not an easy life. Often the issues that push them into the gay lifestyle are deeply painful. However, I didn't agree with Picoult's take on the subject--not a big surprise since this is such a volatile topic today.<br />  I, like every reader, carry my own baggage into a story.  As a child of divorce, there will always be a part of me that wishes the broken relationship miraculously repaired. My heart cannot choke down the death of a marriage, no matter how the writer depicts it.<br />  While I could see that Picoult tried to paint a realistic, fair portrait of a Christian minister, she instead rendered a plastic stereotype. Of course, being married to a pastor, I admit to overreacting to a very minor component in this story.<br />  While Sing You Home may be a solid story, it is not the book for me. 3.6 Stars
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very well made, and designed photo backpack.  Very well balanced, and comfortable to pack all day with...even with a tripod strapped on the side.
B002NT3B52|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book!  It makes one view his / her beloved pet in a completely different light and allows for a better understanding of the dog perspective.  It actually makes me love my dogs more!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|An intricate, heart-wrenching story, told in Picoult's straight-forward prose. I loved Anna and would have been happy to hear the whole story from her point of view. However, getting her parents' perspectives, and finally, her sister's point of view, made for a fuller story. Viewing the story through various secondary characters, even Anna's brother, was too distracting from the main story line. But the tale is gripping and well worth reading. 4.5 Stars
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wonderful app, many choices to customise to your own preferences. Love the weather feature too. One of my favorite apps!
B0010HA68I|5.0|Outstanding product. Used it with my Mountain Equipment Coop backpack to carry my Canon 5D III and a 400mm lens. Hiked for 8 weeks all over volcanoes in Hawaii on the Big Island, Maui and Kauai with this Optech system and it performed flawlessly. Solid and secure clips, easy to operate even with frozen and gloved fingers at 13,800ft walking to top of Mauna Kea. Webbing and hooks are top quality and hold up very well under difficult conditions (snow, frozen water, mud, did not rot in tropical rainforests, etc). I will buy more for the next expeditions. This is NOT a cheap off-shore Asian knock-off with free shipping. I earn my living as a geologist in some of the world's most extreme environments and this product fills all of my requirements. Buy it, use it and enjoy it.
B00340ESIS|4.0|Whether you plan on being a scriptwriter or just a movie watcher, Blake Snyder does a great job of providing a path to a screenplay that works and entertains
B008C20TDG|5.0|It Starts With Food is a very well-written, science-based approach to all aspects of why we eat the wrong foods, and how to eat the right ones. I just finished my first Whole30 and while it wasn't fun to work through my food-based problem areas, I am SO glad I did it.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Good story line but too drawn out.  I skipped several chapters & went to the last two chapters.  Do not feel like I missed anything.  I did enjoy what I read
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were amazing. I waited a long time for the 3rd to come out, I was sadly disappointed by the end of the book. I wish I never read the last one and just made up my own ending.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is a fantastic 6 inch tall figure. The colors are amazing, she looks like she came right out of the anime! Her joints require a delicate hand because of her size, but she is still really sturdy. An amazing amount of faces and accessories come with her!
B00902AKK4|4.0|Havent played it much yet. Mostly downloaded it for the grand daughters. Im sure they will like it, they're better at games than me  :-)
B00A9V2JSG|1.0|very poorly written. incredibly slow and dull. interesting plot, but 300-too many pages. Don't waste your money, its the typical post-apocalyptic/dystopian romance. If you like this genre, like me, take my advice and find something else...
B006IGZX0C|5.0|It was a true depiction of how it was in the early 50's-60's. You felt the way they felt. It was a great heart wrenching movie! All of the actors were excellent.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|When I heard about the movie, and the premise itself, I thought it was stupid.<br />Friends asked if I was going to see it in the theater; I said &#34;No, I'm waiting for the sequel: 'Life of Cake'!&#34;<br /><br />Then my wife brought it in for &#34;Family Night&#34;. (&#34;Oh CRAP!&#34;)<br />The visual was beautiful, many parts were intense, the plot was engaging, but the ending was stunning!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Love Liam Neeson. He is a great actor & it showed in this movie. It kept you guessing & had lots of twist in it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great book, well written, fast reading and easy to pick up where one left off. Did not want it to end.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not as good as the first 2...seems like it was written differently too and it was pretty slow. The only thing that kept me reading was just to finish the trilogy ( and i basically gobbled the first 2 in a week)
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Really cute movie!  Probably not as good as the first one, but a great feel good story about perseverance and friendship.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Found this story to be very entertaining.  Several gteat characters. I recommend it If your looking for a fun book.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for the storyline and action. Tying the historic background to this modern tale was very wise.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the way all the stories came together. Good read, and was shocked when the secret was revealed. Liked the ending.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Why do you run out of lives and have to wait? I know it's to make money but it ruins the game. I just shut it off forever!
B00CATONCA|5.0|The most expectacular limited edition bluray pack, If i compare this season with the second, AMC make more finishing details, im cant wait for the season 4 limited edition! :D
B000002H5I|4.0|&#34;Fast Car&#34; is a classic.  Her work was so transforming, yet deeply sad as well.  This is a great CD!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Loved the trilogy but really thought this last book could have been written differently thus creating maybe a fourth book. I just want to keep reading.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|didn't work at all. Couldn't even get it to do anything...Maybe I just don't understand how these free things work but it should not be that hard.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves it and watches the digital copy all the time on the ipad.  Blu-ray has extras as well.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|Just as the title says, the author goes over 23 common myths and sacred truths held by capitalists. Aside for the introduction and conclusion, the book is divided into 23 chapters. These are:<br /><br />1. There is no such thing as free market.<br />2. Companies should not be run in the interest of their owners.<br />3. Most people in rich countries are paid more than they should be.<br />4. The washing machine has changed the world more than the internet has.<br />5. Assume the worst about people and you get the worst.<br />6. Greater macroeconomic stability has not made the world economy more stable.<br />7. Free market policies rarely make poor countries rich.<br />8. Capital has a nationality.<br />9. We do not live in a post industrial age.<br />10. The US does not have the highest living standard in the world.<br />11. Africa is not destined for underdevelopment.<br />12. Government can pick winners.<br />13. Making rich people richer doesn’t make the rest of us richer.<br />14. US managers are overpriced.<br />15. People in poor countries are more entrepreneurial than people in rich countries.<br />16. We are not smart enough to leave things to the market.<br />17. More education in itself is not going to make a country richer.<br />18. What is good for General Motors is not necessarily good for the United States.<br />19. Despite the fall of communism, we are still living in planned economies.<br />20. Equality of opportunity may not be fair.<br />21. Big government makes people more open to change.<br />22. Financial markets need to become less, not more efficient.<br />23. Good economic policy does not require good economists.<br /><br />It would take too long for me to go over each of these chapters. In any case, the titles are self-explanatory. I will instead try to look at the common thread uniting them. And the common thread is that the author does not oppose capitalism per se. In fact, he likes it. He is not some left wing neo-Marxist who opposes accumulation of wealth and wants to abolish private property. What he does oppose, however, is the neoliberal brand of capitalism. For those who don’t know, neoliberalism was (and still is) the dominant economic ideology for the past thirty years. Neoliberalism, to simplify, advocates as little government involvement in the economy as possible and taxing the rich as little as possible. There are two reasons for that. The first one, the neoliberalists claim, is that markets are the most efficient when left to their own devices. The second one is that rich people are, supposedly, the main creators of wealth and it is their private spending and business activities that drive the economy.<br /><br />The author takes a good, hard look at these claims and one by one demolishes them. He argues that neoliberalism is inefficient at best, and destructive at worst. If you do not believe him, just look at what happened in 2008. The 2008 economic crisis was the worst one since the 1929 Great Depression. The recovery has been so slow that in many ways you could say that the crisis is still ongoing.<br /><br />For thirty years the world has been adopting neoliberal policies. Some places adopted them more than others, but overall the world economy had shifted considerably towards what neoliberalists wanted. The markets have been steadily deregulated and the rich got richer (whereas the poor stayed more or less as poor as they were). And where is this great prosperity that they said we will be getting? All I see is the rich getting richer and everyone else suffering.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a very good book about a very important subject. It is not a book for economists (although they should read it too), but for laymen. It avoids using complicated economic terms and explains everything in very plain, simple language. I say that the book is about a very important subject because even if you are not interested in economics, you are affected by it. We all live, function andwork in a society that is to large extent affected and shaped by economic forces. These economic forces have been, in turn, affected and shaped in the past thirty years by neoliberalism—an ideology that obviously is not working. I give this book five stars.work in a society that is to large extent affected and shaped by economic forces.

B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This is the best album I have heard all year. It's a great mix of rock and r&b and classical inspirations. People need to stop sleeping on Janelle. It isn't today's R&B where people write 4 lines and sing it over and over again. Or songs where the R&B is basically a hip hop song with no mention of the traditional themes of R&B. This album is rooted in what R&B should be in music today. Good solid song writing coupled with musicianship. The themes of love, lost, and lust are all there but in the subtleness that is at the root of R&B/Rock music.  She even probably outperforms Prince on their duet. Enough said.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|In all honesty, this partial series is a 5-star seed--which may or may not have developed consistently into a 5-star fully bloomed series. It's an awfully, painfully promising start to a creative venture. Watch it. Enjoy it. Grieve for it.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|Level 3-1 has a glitch where Lep falls off the screen and you can't advance at all. So frustrating! If this glitch were fixed I would rate 5 stars!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show.  I can not wait toe see what happens in Season 4.  January can't get hear fast enough.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This bike seat has been wonderful. My daughter loves it. She is 2.5 and still fits perfect, with no issues. It's so nice to have her on the front rather than behind us when bike riding. Would recommend this to anyone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great read!  Grisham gets you into the story on the first page, and keeps you there.  I hated to see it end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hours fly by. Time is gone. Light has turned to darkness. Huge blocks of time are sucked away by Candy Crush. I love it. Wasted time? Sure it is. It's cheaper than therapy though. If you want to put your problems on hold, get rid of jelly and get a sugar high without the jitters this game is for you.
B0014JKJJI|5.0|These shoes were the shoes I expected for a long time ago!!!!! I should refer them to my co-workers! I would show off my comfortable working shoes to them!
B000007ODL|5.0|JJ Cale is one of those artist I thought I knew, but after getting this album and really listening to it I realized the man had a depth of talent that i had not ever fully appreciated. He was a remarkably talented song writer and had a deft talent with the guitar. No he was not a showy virtuoso guitar talent, but rather a ultra-cool, laid back hipster/cowboy/hippie with a sense of timing and rhythm that I wish I had.. He makes me want to pick up my guitar and start playing along - and I do!! Highly recommended collection of great music!!!!
0307120007|3.0|I like the IDEA of this book -- textures and scent in a gentle setting for baby -- but it is not practical at all for infants and toddlers. The binding is very flimsy (like a wire notebook binding? very strange) and very easy to tear and destroy. If they ever reissue this book in a board book format, I will be all over this. In the meantime, it's staying on the bookshelf.
B007EECSFA|4.0|We chose this for our next book club and I had just a bit of difficulty getting into the book initially. But it gradually built up and the characters evolved and it hooked me. I really have not read many novels set in WWII and I had a special appreciation for our Vets this past Veteran's Day. This is the first book I've read by this author, but will not be my last. I would recommend it.
0316056898|4.0|Hilarious! Love Tina Fey. Perfect balance between intellectual, lovable, and badass. I've wanted read this book for awhile and finally found it in a cute little bookstore downtown. Worth the money!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|The storyline grabs you right from the start and takes you on a whirlwind ride right to the end. I hope there's more to come!
B00AEFXC4C|5.0|This movie I'd just flat out hysterical!  You'll laugh till the tears run down your face, turn to blood, and you die!  Too funny!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|George Benson has created a real 'inspirational' CD here. His playing is always top notch, but what sets this disc apart is the treatment he gives to these classic tunes. George's singing is amazing, and his contributors are equally impressive. He has make a disc for every lover of Nat's music. There are not a lot of tracks where you just hear his playing, but when you do it's instantly recognizable as his masterful style. I have enjoyed George's guitar for many years, and yet this disc was a surprise. I wasn't aware that he had a voice as good as he does.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|This is sort of a different type of movie for Jason Statham. He plays a damaged cop who has a few problems, but he does not have a problem saying what he thinks or bringing down a cop killer with a creative deception.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I loved Fringe when it was on ! Like all JJ Abrams things it got a bit convoluted for a while, but it did come back around nicely. The third season was as good as it had ever been in the past - if you haven't seen it then you should !
B008Y7J91M|4.0|Very entertaining and an insight into how poor families managed to struggle by with the assistance of relatives in distant places.  But beyond that, a wonderful opportunity for a young woman to grow, become educated and prosper in a wealthy family that had much kindness and compassion for taking in a young girl. Her stoke of good luck. Sending their eldest daughter away was the opportunity for the young girl to not only become less of a burden on her family but altered her entire life forever.  It was an entrance into a better life of many more privileges than she would ever have had this not happened.<br /><br />Perhaps Jane Austen was making a statement about how rare it is for someone's fortune to change so completely. Dickens orphans always met with strife, cruelty and horrible circumstances before much later in their lives being released from their bondage.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in British literature, history or the roles of women in previous eras.
044042335X|5.0|Lee Child and Jack Reacher are the best. Like most of the Reacher books, this one was very difficult to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted !! Sometimes I get so involved I lose track of time and before I know it, it's way past bed time.
0763621803|4.0|My daughter (who is a picky eater) loved the book and got the message immediately! It helps that she watches their cartoon.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A wonderful movie based on a true story. Richard Farnsworth started in movies as a stuntman, but eventually started getting speaking roles. He seemed to be a very easy going man and a genuine cowboy (in my humble opinion). He was near 80 years old while making this movie and in great pain due to years of injuries from being a stuntman. I'm not sure if it is true, but read that he took his own life after they finished filming this movie.
B00632HWOG|1.0|What a train wreck! Right up there with IOS7.<br />First it is impossible to read as the graphics and colors are terrible on the eyes. Second what in Gods name makes you think I want my emails in a single running conversation or I want a copy sent back to myself? This makes finding the email and keeping is sooo much more difficult. There are many other complaints like emails do not show up based on time despite the fact I repeatedly click this in my choices folder.<br />Give me back my old email. If I could change without a hassle and needing to give 300 people a new email I would change email providers.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|You need the internet to get great access to this app which can be inconvenient if you don't always have wireless access.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Extremely addictive!! You do seem to get more freebies if you play on Facebook rather than the kindle or iPhone...
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Excellent pacing, unusual depth, interesting and believable characters, and cool space pistols developed by an alien race.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Put another way, if Iain Banks is the six star ideal, this book is one step below.
B0026O475M|5.0|This is a great movie about adapting to and overcoming adversity, determining what is important in life and self reliance.
B00CATSONE|1.0|This material is more like a college paper than a book (46 pages do not a book make!). In the first half the author portrays himself as a Malcolm Gladwell / motivational speaker wannabe. The second half is more or less an amalgamation of what can be found on the internet about Tesla.
B00541ML4S|5.0|very nice and easy for me to get this cap.  It is fit to my camera.  Thank you so much
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was amazing. The whole movie was well thought out and the actors were very good. I loved the ending and how everything tied together.One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B00B9E29CI|3.0|Among the more differentiated books on parenting that talk about the value of character skills rather than cognitive skills alone.  Could do a better job of thinking about what makes up these character skills in turn
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This movie was good acting but kind of intense and dark!  I was looking for something more upbeat and hopeful!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|This book was alright but lacked true depth for me. The fact that she fell in love with her brother was absurd and a very childish plot twist. Besides that I didn't really get to know most of the characters since the way the book is written it centers almost fully on Clary.
0399161287|5.0|Mike Tyson's Undisputed Truth is a well written work that gives a good account of his life in ways that have never been told before. It gives the reader an insight into his character,motivations and actions in a way that makes him truly human with vulnerabilities, strengths, passions and other positive attributes. It is a page turner and probably the best biography or autobiography I have read in a while, or perhaps Disciples of Fortune that I read a while ago. There are tons of lessons to learn from this, especially on the consistency part, despite all the distractions that came his way.
1250038820|4.0|I used to live in New York and love the people and places. This book is a wonderful representation of the diversity of people.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am in love with this show and it's characters. The character development is really good going into season three. I was very impressed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is insanely addictive and awesome I just can't put it down night or day it is too much fun and d challenges are off the charts
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It is a little slow getting out of the start gate, but once it does its ok. It is not a bad movie at all. I actually saw it 2 times so that's saying a lot for me.
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|This series is really good. I love all the characters and the plot. It just gets better with every season.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Great story and excellent acting. Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr always make you feel like they are there in time with the no matter what  movies they are in.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|love the game but would not let in log in and took me to another farm not my own.  pleads fix
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Just getting into season 3. Both 1 and 2 have addicted us to this series. Can't believe I never knew of it when it was airing, but to now get the whole seasons at a time let's you watch it much faster than an episode a week. Being able to watch 2 of 3 hours at a time really boosts continuity too!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem does it again u know he always come threw with good music and RAP GOD is just too good so a must  buy
B0097EWK3A|3.0|The fact that it too hard to find things and too easy to skip the puzzles, makes this game a little too boring and frustrating.
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome!  This series is going to be a classic and is one of my favorites for sure.  Can't wait for sequels.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I had trouble my first night using this app but after a few weeks of no problems I'm convinced it was my device that acted up.<br />I love this app. It's much nicer than the stock alarms I can set on my phone and I love it's double use as a bedside clock (don't forget to keep your device plugged in when using it this way!)
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Family drama, struggle, self reflection and action...yes it has all those! I enjoyed it thoroughly. A great take on the Superman role. It does have violence but no sex. Very little cursing if any at all from what I remember. It is family friendly. He is still the Man of Steel...great movie.
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|i just would like to know what the claws going to be made of will they be some plastic junk or at least some decent metal and also why didnt the wait the next and last movie hits in jan 2014 i just seen the preview at the thor 2 movie
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So heart breaking and so beautifully written. I'd recommend this book very much. the perspective of death as narrator was perfectly done
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Meh, It was worth a watch on a slow day but I would dedicate a special evening to it. I like Jeff Bridges and the movie has some entertaining spots in it but just was rushed story line and had a Men in Black type of CGI feel to it.
B005KXT58U|5.0|Very solid album. I've gone back and forth on their previous works, Fallen and The Open Door: I enjoy & own both albums, but don't necessarily like every song. This album, however, seems very cohesive as a whole and yet the songs still retain individual flavor. Longtime fans of the band are sure to like it, but this album could also win over some new converts.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, and I am a bit of a movie nut.  So moving, and the score is so perfectly wedded to the images of an amazing planet, and the peoples who inhabit it, with all their strange and wonderful traditions.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am trek fan so I loved this movie. It has dark villain and a young ego maniac Captain Kirk. This a recipe for success!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Love the Stargate SG1 series, wish the didn't stop making them...  This is the Jonas instead of Daniel season ....
B0084TWN9K|2.0|The writing is beautiful, the stories are bleak, dark, depressing; not what I like for &#34;recreational&#34; reading and not an author to whom I would return
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Meh, it is ok. It is geared more towards preteen and kids but does have some sexy scenes in it. I just had a hard time really enjoying it. It was not bad but not good.
B00942G4UA|5.0|So detailed into what we eat this movie will have you cringing but at the same time learning what's so vital to learn . Don't be ignorant as to what we re eating out there
B006LSZECO|4.0|Fun, cleverly written, the characters are well developed and deep, although I am not sure I would want to invite any of them to dinner
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I've always liked Bill Bryson.  While this book wasn't  as humorous as many of his others it was a very informative book about a very eventful period in our history.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|It's an okay movie with some glitches. The movie Is too Unrealistic and the acting needs work. See if for yourself.
B00ESNE696|5.0|LOVE ALL THE CHARECTERS GETS BETTER EVERY WEEK! THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST SHOW ON TV RIGHT NOW ALWAYS,ALWAYS SURPRISED OR SHOCKED AT WHAT GOES ON AT LOCKHART AND GARDNER!!!
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|this movie is outstanding with father and son playing the parts.  Great acion on both of their character parts played.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you don't mind waiting a little while for the energy to recharge it's a lot<br />Of fun and definitely help pass the time.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone needs to see what they are eating, and give some hard thought to what they see.<br />How did America come to this.
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|Well, this isn't an i7 processor, but for the price, I'd be stunned if you could do any better.<br /><br />I use this guy in a small, mini-itx/htpc build. I previously had a dual-core A4 in there, and to be blunt, it just left a lot to be desired in terms of performance. As soon as I got this processor up and running, I was amazed at the difference. The computer booted fast, everything loaded faster, much less lag while surfing the 'net, etc.<br /><br />I'm not as techy as some of the other people who shop at Amazon, so I can't tell ya if it was the difference in the number of cores vs. the cache(s) vs. power ratings, etc. All I can say is that it made a relatively mild computer into a full-on usable PC. And for the price, I just don't think it can be beat.<br /><br />My setup:<br />AMD A8-6600K<br />MSI FM2-A75IA-E53 mainboard<br />Patriot 4GB x2 Vier III RAM<br />FSP 350w PSU<br />OCZ Vertex 3 SSD 120GB<br />Various external drives for media storage<br />Silverstone SG06-Lite Mini ITX case
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Perfect gift for a KT Tunstall fan! Much more Acoustic Guitar driven then Tiger Suit and very mellow for late night listening
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Been waiting to see this one.  Just when I thought the story ended, it didn't and brought in more action and mystery.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kiddo loves this game, and it has become one of my guilty pleasures.  Runs a little slow on a Kindle Fire HD, so make sure you close any open apps.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love a good book. It has the right amount of romance, action and roughness. I couldn't get enough
B007FG9LIE|4.0|A little confusing at first, then the story got into full swing.  I like how the sheriff brought the towns people to their senses and told them what they wanted to know so desperately.  The villain here is the creator of the town.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and challenging.  Wished there were more options to clear lines.  For the price, you can't believe the fun.  Would recommend this game for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game, its a lot of fun and a good distraction when I have a lot of time between classes.
1451673442|5.0|this was a good book to read I found it easy to understand and enjoyed reading this book very much
B00CL0J99K|4.0|This is number 3 in the series. The action, special effects, wow. Lets see if we can get &#34;Pepper&#34; to have some coffee and get going, right?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wonderful story! Takes place a few years after A Time To Kill, and is about the same main character, but you don't need to have read that first. As usual, an amazing read from John Grisham, right up to the very end, with twists and turns to keep you guessing the whole time. Right after we finished this, my husband and I rented A Time To Kill, and we hope this book is made into a movie too!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the book.  A great read.  It was awesome to find out what became of Danny as he grew up.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Very cute movie.  The kids love it and want to watch it over and over again. I don't think it's ad good as monsters inc but I still enjoyed it very much.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It's a lot of action packed into one book, and I eventually got burned out thinking &#34;really?! It isn't possible that one person could get into that much trouble!&#34; It's just a little to preposterous, perhaps if it had been spread out more? It's kinda like the problems of the entire seven seasons of buffy packed into one episode.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I think I prefer to watch the entire season at one time though versus weekly episodes
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a very good abbreviated version.  There are a good amount of items.  Some things don't work like crafting and such but that's just the way it is.  Seems very expensive in my opinion but I won't cry about it.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|I love this story. This is Hollywood's best attempt at telling what happened. But it shows one man's devotion to a job that requires even an emotional investment by even the ...
0061906220|5.0|My son loves this writer and these books. He is just learning to read and Pete the Cat is his favorite book of all times. Every night we are either reading this one or the one about groovy buttons. I plan on buying more of these books so he will continue to love to read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great story with many twists and turns.  As one of Mr. Grisham's faithful readers, this is definitely one of his best.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Jojo Moyes is an excellent author who truly knows how to &#34;spin&#34; a yarn!<br />This is one of my all time favorite books.
B007N6ZH5M|5.0|Succinct work. Enjoyable read. A must have for an Economics/Finance professional and even otherwise a good book to own. Recommend a read
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Helen Fielding does it again. Only this time Bridget is more poignant and mature. Her hilarity takes on a new persona as she is dealt a card no one ever hopes to receive.
B004GYY714|5.0|It is simply amazing.. I love hearing tamil FM channels with this apps...it is easy to operate....and ..to add favorite channels
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Well built case, unfortunatly my eyes are old and I sold it with the Kindle.  In process of getting the larger Fire and plan on buying the Marware case if available.  Easy to use and the prop up doesn't slip like some &#34;Mcrosoft&#34; products.
0316055433|5.0|Every review I've read of The Goldfinch uses the term 'Dickensian,' and it's easy to see why.  I didn't so much read this book as climb into it, immersing myself in its beautiful language and vivid characters.  It was hard to wrench myself back to the world around me, and I found myself reading slower and slower as I approached the final chapters.  It's the richest kind of reading experience.  Very -- well -- Dickensian!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not very exciting and extremely dragged out. This was actually an interesting story but there was so much needless descriptive and repetitive crap that I was praying it would just be over.
B001F6ZIXW|1.0|Casting for main character all wrong.  Mediocre writing, very off base cop to gang relationship.  It seems as if they cast MR. Rogers to be the bad ass, almost impossable to believer.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|The mystery just goes on and on,  every time you turn a page there's something new that's happening, Meanwhile there's romance going on, but is he trustable? I don't want this to end. Thanks Susan. Can't wait for the next book!<br />diane
0738711500|5.0|It is an excellent introduction in how to accurately read the tarot cards. It's book lay out is very good and it helps you learn quickly as you continue through the book. I have been reading the cards for years and was just curious when I bought it. It has shown me several new things and of course Ciro Marchetti's deck tops it off.
B003SQVI54|4.0|Nothing to do with old ladies hunting young men but produced by Bill Lawrence that can make a terrible premise into a gold mine of humor
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a compelling story told from the point of view of the personification of Death.  I know that sounds gruesome, but Death is actually compassionate and sad at man's inhumanity to man.  He illustrates life in Nazi Germany by narrating the story of a foster child living in a German household.  After the loss of her own family, the child's life expands to a mama, a papa and the Jew hidden in the basement. The story is an unusual perspective on the Holocaust, seen through the eyes of clearly drawn characters -- both  marks of good writing -- but Markus Zusak's use of metaphor is absolutely genius.  They are like little paintings throughout the story.  The story is both beautiful and painful.
B009NX3TB2|5.0|Great thought provoking film. I didn't what to expect from this film but now I know why it won so many awards.
B003TTH4IU|4.0|Only medical show that captures my attention after the discontinuation of Scrubs.  Started as a comedy and through the usual season after season writers bun out turned a bit too serious.  Looks like it's headed back the right more comediac or humorouse stuff being written in.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Loved the movie and game is awesome!! Could have used a few more upgrades but other than that this game is amazing!!
630469654X|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my mom, and although it was used, it looks and played like a brand new one! Very satisfied with my order. Love the movie
B005CKPQNE|5.0|PROOVES good acting and good writting can over come a very low budget.  Holly woood needs to take a look at this formula, BB was filmed in Alb NM where the guy making 8 bucks an hour can support himself.  Kudo's for picking a location cheap sets and makink it REAL.  Most believable Bad Break I've seen.  Hear me Hollywood!  You can turn out good stuff like this thrilling accurate human nature searies I've seen.  And, it ended on it's own terms, not how many viewers.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This isn't really my cup of tea but its a well made game with no glitches and easy game play. It's simple but fun. I like the achievements. Hit the king with a rock. I think it gives u extra rocks. One time the king even grabbed the PAUSE button to throw at the enemies. That was confusing. I thought it was a glitch at first. lol<br />I'll probably play it awhile longer before uninstalling. As I said before I don't really like these kinds of games, but I do want to see what other secrets and acheivements I can find.  :)<br />The one thing that bothered me was I couldn't find the exit button, unless I missed it I don't think it has one. I had to go into my app manager to close it. And I don't like doing that. I know most phones have a home button these days to get out of apps but I still like having an exit button.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|Very gripping tale, hard to put down, lots of fun to read in one continuous drag. Tartt's best one so far !

B00DQVST76|4.0|Madonna's MDNA Tour is really good. My copy I bought the DVD version played perfectly. Her song choices were well chosen. It looks like the dvd is currently out of print. If your an fan of Madge this is an must have for you DVD collection.
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|It's a fairly good show. I like the mix of old and new music. Some old staples that haven't been heard in a while. But the over all feel is nothing special. Maybe they were at the end of the tour and burnt but they seem kinda lifeless and just going through the motions. And I guess they'll just never be the same DT to me without Portnoy. Mangini is competent but lacks the soul that Mike gave to this group. Video quality is pretty good. Not too much cut and pan. DTS HD gets a 3.5 to 4 star. Some places really good. Other times a bit washed out. Drums / keyboards / bass all disappear in a wall of noise. Not reference quality. But not too bad. Definitely worth having if you're even remotely a fan. Budokan is better.<br /><br />Got to give them credit for being touring fiends though. Maybe that's it. They are definitely showing age. And weight. Aren't we all!

0399162097|4.0|I first heard about this book on NPR and it sounded very intriguing. The description, however, does not do this book justice. I know they are trying to avoid a plot twist, but I really feel, you should go into this book prepared. So, if you don't want this \\"plot twist\\" revealed, don't read any further.<br /><br />In this book you follow Rosemary \\"Rose\\" and the rest of her family. Her father is a research scientist mainly in the field of chimpanzees. Other members of her family are her mother, her brother Lowell, her almost twin sister Fern and her imaginary friend Mary. At the age of five, her sister Fern is taken away and the family is forever broken. Five years later, her brother also takes off. In order to ease you into things, Rose starts off her story in the middle. She doesn't take you back towards the beginning until page 77. You see Rosemary's family is part of an experiment to see exactly how \\"human\\" a chimpanzee can be, if raised from birth (or almost birth). Fern joins the family at the age of 3 months, when Rose is just a one month old infant. Rose's mother loves all of her children dearly. So, they live in a house full of grad students who see just how Rose and Fern relate to one another. How much do they influence one another. It is these early years that highly define just who Rose is.<br /><br />It also defines her brother who is told to love Fern just as if she was his real sister. He grows up to be wanted by the FBI for domestic terrorism for fighting for animals rights.<br /><br />Throughout the book, you come to many revelations about Rose and her family.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I put it up as a possible pick for my book club, but ultimately we ended up choosing another one of my picks. I could easily see a book club getting good discussion out of this book. I'm glad I picked it up and read it.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Works great. A little difficult to set up, but once you get it going, you don't want to stop using it
0525478817|5.0|Wow. I really liked this book, I might even love it. I almost read the whole thing in one sitting, but my husband insisted that I come to bed, so I reluctantly put it down and finished it up the next morning.<br /><br />I like how John Green was inspired by Esther Earl when he came up with Hazel. I know it's not her story there are some similarities as well as lots of differences. I like how two kids are trying to find a way to live while they are dying. I knew going in that I would most likely cry while reading this story and I did. It's a book about kids with cancer, we all know it can't be happy all the time. I love Hazel and Gus's witty banter and the way they try to keep things light. I love the ways that John Green makes you think about what kind of impact you might leave or not leave once you are gone. I like the way he handles what can be a very heavy subject, especially for a parent.<br /><br />We picked this book to read and discuss at our April 2014 book club meeting, but I wanted to read the book sooner. I fully plan on listening to the audio version of this book closer to our book club meeting and have no problem re-reading this book. I can see getting lots of discussion out of this book.<br /><br />Speaking of discussion have you read John Green's FAQs about this book on his website? I recommend checking that out after you finish this book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading that too.<br /><br />What can I say? I recommend you read this book.
B004MQ8A78|1.0|The first hour was the worst I've ever seen, relentlessly boring. This is the only Paranormal Activity movie I've seen but it doesn't make me want to see another.
0143120581|4.0|I can see this book being an interesting discussion at book club. There are a variety of parenting ways, some more extreme than others and this book is just one example of extreme parenting.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty easy read. Some parts might have you shaking your head. I know this style of parenting would never work in my house. My daughter and I would be pretty much just like Amy and Lulu.<br /><br />It always nice to read about other people's parenting struggles, mainly because it makes you feel like your family is completely normal in it's own crazy way. EVERYONE has their own parenting struggles, they just might not say them out-loud.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Engaging, intelligent, fast paced, and funny... oh and really hot female cast members don't hurt either. I really enjoyed this series.
1250012570|4.0|3.5 Stars. After a few pages, I was quickly drawn into this very sweet, hopeful romance about two teens. I stayed up until about 1-2am my time to finish the book. I think the romance is very innocent and sweet. Our characters are suppose to be 16, but most of the time when I read it, I kept picturing them as 13 or 14 year olds, but I still liked the story.<br /><br />You follow Park and Eleanor.<br /><br />Park is a half-Korean kid, who has lived in the area his whole life. Parents met, when his Dad was serving in Korea and she came home with him. Park isn't the most popular kid, but he's not really an outcast either. I guess I would consider him a kid on the fringe. He is somewhat quiet and really loves music and comic book.<br /><br />Eleanor is the new girl. She has crazy red hair and brown eyes. She dresses funny and doesn't really fit in anywhere. Her family is poor, partially due to her alcoholic step-father who drinks away a lot of their money. She is the oldest of five kids. Eleanor tries to make the best of her situation and tries to keep her head down and not get noticed by her step-dad.<br /><br />When she gets on the bus her first day of school she ends up sitting with Park. They don't talk. This books is about how their relationship slowly blossoms over multiple bus rides and eventually off the bus.<br /><br />I like how they talk about various music and even the comic books.<br /><br />I would have given this book 4 stars, but I didn't really care for the ending.

B00FQPHA0M|2.0|I hate writing reviews and I rarely do so BUT this movie was a DISASTER if you are a Superman fan! I wanted to really like man of steel but I feel that they spent more time and tons of money on pointless drawn out fight scenes. There was so much they could have done with this movie and they ruined it. With all the stupid scripts that make it into films these days man of steel should have been a bright spot. They had decades of tv shows, comics, films and books to learn from! I think the lowest point in the film for me was when the army girl at the end of the movie comments on how she thinks superman is hot. (SERIOUSLY!?!?!?!?!?!) I'm not twelve so stupid scenes like this that are suppose to be funny just come out as extremely juvenile. I'm so glade I didn't see this in the theater or buy it like I had planned. $6 was enough spent on renting the HD streaming version. I should have waited for it to be on Amazon prime. It was a total waste of money. Now I have to wait another 30 years for a better remake......
B00BD99JMW|3.0|So, she writes this from the perspective of both Tris and Tobias, but very difficult to tell who is narrating mid chapter.  I agree with a lot of the other reviews on here.  This book could have been so much better but it tried to add too many complicated layers to the story at the end.
B004P7CMUU|4.0|Once upon a time it was a given statement that the book was better than the movie. Directors and screenwriters finally realized that with effort the movie could become a stand-alone achievement and on occasion come up on the better side of the comparison. Robert Benton's the Human Stain stands very well against the original Philip Roth novel. Movie making allows for a tighter, more streamlined construction and does a better job focusing on a select number of major story themes. What this movie lacks is much of the brilliant language of Philip Roth and a few complexities that make the larger story more credible. This is a very good movie it could have been a very great movie.<br /><br />Before the first word is spoken the gray winter and the dolorous music bring us to the sudden death of the two people will be the center of the balance of this movie. That's not a spoiler alert that's barely 30 seconds into the movie. In telling us the story of Dean Coleman Silk (a miscast Anthony Hopkins) and Faunia Farley (a frumpy Nicole Kidman) we start off knowing how the story will end but not knowing if the ending is in fact tragic.<br /><br />Dean Silk has recently been maneuvered out of his position as Dean of a small New England college. He is also taken up with a much younger and much less educated school janitor and postmistress for the nearby village. These are two profoundly damaged people each with tragic secrets. The vast distances between them in age, education and social circumstance do not matter so much as the common fact of their damaged lives. In finding each other and in finding love the plot question is: have they resolved their respective lives such that they are now ready for what we know will be their death?<br /><br />In streamlining the story we lose all of the politics that came together to strip Dean Coleman of his position. The simplified story involving the professor's use of the word \\"spook\\" to describe students he had never seen. Students who, because they are black are able to complain that use of the word spook constitutes racism. Absent the larger context of university maneuvering this complaint comes off as insufficient for ending and otherwise honorable career. Additionally Sir Anthony Hopkins for all his brilliant acting lacks the correct accent and he is not convincing as a New Jersey Jew; never mind that this is persona is a beard for who he really is.<br /><br />Faunia's ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris) is a wonderful performance as a psychotic Vietnam vet and spouse abuser. In the book I felt that the psychotic Vietnam vet character was somewhat cliched in the movie this aspect of the character is unnecessary and should have been trimmed. By 2003 the issues of ex-husband stalking and spouse abuse was sufficiently standardized that there was very little to be gain by heaping yet another insult on Vietnam veterans.<br /><br />These errors aside the Human Stain is a very good movie. It is drama, but hardly intense drama. For all the choppy, out of sequence flashbacks the story flows in a reasonably ordered progression of reveals and explanations. Some will consider this a sad story and therefore not a movie you may choose to watch more than once. There is sufficient complexity to justify more than one viewing. Part of that complexity is in trying to decide if the story really is sad and tragic and without risking another spoiler I will suggest there are reasons to reject the concept that this is a tragedy. The Human Stain is worth a viewing and there is enough to bring you back for images and dialogue you may have missed.e they are black are able to complain that use of the word spook constitutes racism.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Very good deal for the price.  I've had this clear case about 18 months, and it still looks good.  Was pretty easy to put on-- it is always work to get the bubbles out of a screen protector, but I did without too much effort.  I didn't want a case that would make the phone bulky, and I like that you can see the phone (and Apple logo) through the back.  I have dropped the phone indoors a couple of times, and the case protected it.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't know yet, really. I was disappointed; I thought Roth could have gone in a more dynamic, hopeful direction. I'm having a hard time finding the redeeming element to her plot choices. Divergent was such a great, original idea. I thought the series would end with fireworks instead of more of a fizzle :(

B007R3B4RG|4.0|I will tell you the story behind this album.  Producer Daniel Rey had possession of several demos that Joey Ramone recorded before his untimely passing.  Joey's family asked for the demos, but Rey refused to turn them over.  So a lawsuit was brought against Rey.  Several years later, a settlement was reached and the family got the demos.  Additional instruments and vocals were added to the demos to give them a fuller sound.  They did a good job of making an album that Joey would have been proud of.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|I can see why some readers would dislike this book. Maybe it was predictable for some. Maybe it was too love strong. Maybe the ending was not ideal or offended their morals. Perhaps there weren't enough big words in it to look up. Maybe those are the reasons I, myself, knocked off one star. But...I just stayed up until 3am to finish this book because the ending couldn't wait for tomorrow. I cried my fool eyes out even though I was quite convinced that I could tough it out tissue free. I found it pleasing to be surprised at the emotions that the author was able to draw out of me, making the read a learning experience that didn't involve the words historical fiction.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Bryson seems to be interested in just about everything, and jumps freely between topics as diverse as early aviation and the increase in home runs starting in the late 1920's.  I found some of the story lines more interesting than others, but Bryson has such a friendly, accessible writing style that even some of the less thrilling subjects were worth reading.  And he manages to be funny without mocking his subjects, which in some instances -- Calvin Coolidge wearing an Indian headdress and chaps springs to mind -- can't be easy.  The uncurious will probably find the scope of this book a bit baffling, but most people should find this an entertaining, educational and enjoyable read.

B002OOG6RQ|4.0|Coming off of the more-thrash-than-industrial metal leanings involved with 2004's excellent \\"Reise, Reise,\\" and, subsequently, 2006's sister album \\"Rosenrot,\\" Rammstein returned with another new album, their sixth from the studio, in 2009. Said year's \\"Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da\\" finds the German industrial metal machine returning to the same basic sound that occupied their early years, with crunchy chugga-chugga guitar leads, head-nodding hooks, uniquely stomping rhythms, and four-on-the-floor beats accented by well-placed keyboard flourishes. And, of course, this record differentiates itself from most other bands of this style in that 99% of it is sung in the band's native tongue. The end result is a familiar but nevertheless effective and potent industrial metal/music stew that is simultaneously heavy, aggressive, but also equally danceable.<br /><br />A really ominous and spooky, keyboard-generated intro to \\"Rammlied\\" is soon replaced by an up-tempo, toe-tappable groove anchored by a solid, underlying bass line, rhythmic beat, and creepy backing synth textures. This coupled with the opening jingle's industrial-strength chugging, help to ensure that it sounds like nothing other than vintage Rammstein. Later cuts, like \\"Ich TU Dir Weh\\" and \\"Mehr\\" work similarly in that they begin with a curiously ambient synth intro before flowing into an aggressive, industrial metal groove and steady chug. But it is actually probably track seven, \\"Wiener Blut,\\" that is the most successful at following this same basic structure. Its melodic beginning immediately gives way to a commandingly brutal, and almost crushing, pure thrash section with deeply grooving guitars and visceral vocals.<br /><br />\\"Waidmanns Heil\\" and \\"B*****\\" are two other gems, as both manage to be insanely catchy and positively danceable numbers while at the same time still boasting heavy, guitar-propelled rhythms. And elsewhere, Rammstein dig a little deeper into their bag of tricks and pull out an acoustic toe-tapper (\\"Fruhling In Paris\\") laced with startlingly harmonic and soaring melodic vocals; a borderline sing-song-y, and entirely English-sung vocal refrain (\\"P***y\\"); and, back on more familiar ground, some distinctly Nine Inch Nails-inspired elements (the electronic/techno-industrial knick-knacks of  the title tune, which is also peppered with a surprisingly good drum solo.)<br /><br />Even though they are far from being a spring chicken, anymore (in 2009, they entered their fifteenth year of existence), Rammstein reaffirm their status as not only one of Germany's finest exports, but as also one of the best and hookiest industrial/groove metal groups this side of Ministry. So while the innovation levels, here, are basically zero, \\"Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da\\" is an undisputedly successful release, at least as far as enjoyment, infectiousness, and dance-ability goes.per (\\"Fruhling In Paris\\") laced with startlingly harmonic and soaring melodic vocals; a borderline sing-song-y, and entirely English-sung vocal refrain (\\"P***y\\"); and, back on more familiar ground, some distinctly Nine Inch Nails-inspired elements (the electronic/techno-industrial knick-knacks of  the title tune, which is also peppered with a surprisingly good drum solo.)<br /><br />Even though they are far from being a spring chicken, anymore (in 2009, they entered their fifteenth year of existence), Rammstein reaffirm their status as not only one of Germany's finest exports, but as also one of the best and hookiest industrial/groove metal groups this side of Ministry.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is Fun and addictive game. However it is a Trojan horse. Not in the virus sense but in the annoying sense. You're forced to either pay, open your Facebook account or delay playing at various points in the game. In spite of how much fun it is, I'm going to uninstall this free version. I hope there will be a pay version that doesn't have these annoying features.

How young people facing a grim and short life find their way and develop alliances and allegiences and attempt to help their families deal with the realities of a lving with terminal disease.

I have enjoyed all the seasons but think the 1st and, so far, the 4th seasons are two of my favorites.  There have been quite a few plot twists in this season so far and we aren't even halfway through the season yet.  If you have never watched the series and are not turned off by a little gore, then I would highly recommend this series to anyone.

B007UXTQAU|4.0|Very good movie but disturbing!  Makes you wonder what exactly would happen if this scenario truly played out.  Some things seem to be a little farfetched even in an apocalyptic situation like what happens with the little girl.  I won't elaborate more so as not to spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet but will say it is a very gritty movie with some pretty graphic scenes in it.  Definitely not a &#34;family&#34; movie, either.  It's a movie, though, you won't soon forget.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Simply put.......It's STAR WARS and it's on Blu-ray.....Will I buy it when it comes out on 4K?  Doubt it, this is good enough for me.

B00E9P959O|4.0|I absolutely loved Earthshine and Vapor Trails the best, but felt Ceiling Unlimited (my favorite cut from the original) was missing something. Pros: The bass and the percussion are a lot cleaner, and the bass lines sound stronger. Cons: Too much layering of the vocal tracks, and too much layering of lead guitar at times. I feel less would have been more there.<br /><br />Although Enya is a different genre altogether, she uses hundreds of layers of vocal tracks, but she pulls that off very, very well. Geddy isn't quite there yet. As far as if the Remix will become my favorite over the original, the jury is still out and I'll need to give it several listens in order to decide. Some parts blew me away, but other parts were very meh.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am with so many of the reviewers here. This last book in Roth's Divergent trilogy is very disappointing.  I also had to stop a few times to remember or check the beginning of the chapter to know who's voice I was reading.  That's never a good sign for a reader. It was unnecessary to give us Four's mind throughout the book.  It might have been better to save that change for after the death of our narrator.  It didn't work and made the book's voice as a whole less interesting and true to what we knew of them before.  She kept them apart far too much to give their voices different experiences but it just felt disingenuous.  There was too much of this new part of the world to really get into properly and it didn't match the level of discovery and tension the first two books had.  The interesting world she created and developed in books 1 and 2 was clumsily added to with no finesse or respect to the characters.  The whole conflict boiled down to a terrible experiment left to go on way too long with no actual purpose that justified the end.  How long were they really willing to wait for pure genes?  People outside the bureau went on with their lives. More time should have been better spent trying to rehabilitate the individuals left to make better citizens and teaching them real skills instead of such a timely and costly experiment where they keep failing at it. Why leave people to live in squalor hating the government?  What a waste to leave such a large portion of humanity suffering for such a lame reason as gene makeup.  It's also nurture, education, environment, and nutrition. It's just so unnecessary and frankly stupid. This once promising trilogy goes out with such an anticlimactic whimper and the world of 1 and 2 didn't deserve it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Jar-Jar Binks killed the mood of this film for me.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor saved this film from a 1-star grave.  Natalie Portman's performance was not as good as I have seen from her in other films, but she did fine.<br /><br />If Jar-Jar had died a horrible, comedic death, the film would have received 4 stars.  Because this awful ear-sore remained, and even continued forward to other films, I felt like I had wasted my $10 to see this in the theater.  Bought it because family wanted it.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I pre ordered, read it immediately and did not enjoy it one bit! So disappointing. I thought I would like reading from Four's point of view, but did not. The minimal romantic exchanges between Tris & Four did not make up for the dismal mood of the entire story. Finding out what was on the other side of the fence was a disappointment. I was hoping for something great, instead mediocre. The author has full control of where the story goes and I couldn't be more diasappointed. So much potential fell completely FLAT! Let's hope they help her out with a re-write when the movie is released. The killer is, you really have to read it if you've put your time into the other two. So my advice is prepare to be underwhelmed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Missed the season when it was on, so great to be able to see it on stream!  Love this show!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I reeeally wanted to love this, and re-read the first two in eager anticipation of the third... but it was disappointing. The biggest frustrations for me were that both of the narration voices (Tris and Tobias) were so similar, and also that telling it from both points of view deflated the tension.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />Maybe she could have kept Tris until the end, and then had Tobias pick it up? I don't know. :(
B009AMAOTQ|5.0|It's the buddy-road-trip movie for the boomers. Four old friends (with some old issues between) them take off for a raucous weekend in Sin City. The emphasis here is on &#34;old&#34; - but the 60-70 crowd still has plenty of life left in them. An improbable stroke of luck near the start of their outing makes wild extravagance almost plausible, but that just makes it more fun. Things like over-attentive adult children, mid-life (maybe late-life) crises, getting back to wild times after a few decades of married peace and quiet, sorrow and recovery from being widowed - all carried off flawlessly. And, it doesn't hurt to be reminded that &#34;retired&#34; and &#34;dead&#34; are different words for good reason. Every decade is a good one, or can be, just not all in the same ways.<br /><br />BTW, if someone pans the movie, check whether they're under 50. If so, they just might not have enough life behind them to appreciate what's going on.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great last book of a great trilogy. I liked that the ending was not what you expect. Can't wait to read more from this author
B008JFUNHI|5.0|A beautiful effect-fest, this gives a stunning reality to the combat training in Card's original words (which, I admit, I read so long ago they've largely faded from mind). Even if a lot of the action &#34;just&#34; simulations or war games, it has a reality to the players that comes through strongly.<br /><br />That said, there were some serious weaknesses in the rest of the movie. The acting was great, I have no problem there, but personality development tended toward the flat, rivalries never took on the edge I'd expect in kids that age, and the whole justification for and morality of child soldiers seemed weak. Hard situations demand hard choices, yes, but making those choices is hard, too, and that quieter kind of drama could have been more important.<br /><br />Great action and convincing effects, but doesn't live up to my hazy memory of the book's emotional imapct.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although the story doesn't go where I thought it would, Roth's choices make perfect sense within the world she created. Overall, this series is an excellent glimpse into human nature with lessons for all who read it. If you're a fan of The Hunger Games and that genre in general, you will love this series.
1492740381|5.0|After you read the first chapter of this book, you would never believe that it was written in the 1890’s. Oscar Wilde is an absolutely brilliant novelist. The Picture of Dorian Gray will be relevant for an extremely long time. It teaches one of the most important lessons that is more relevant to today than when the book was published. The lesson of character over vanity will be relevant for society forever. People are constantly wondering if they have the nicest clothes, if they have the nicest body, if they have the most symmetrical face, or if they have the silkiest hair. For example, Dorian is obsessed with youth and beauty and comments, “Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself”<br />Until recently, a homosexual has been considered a monster. However, this book was lightyears ahead of its time. Within the first few chapters, you can tell that not only do women fall in love with Dorian, but also the men drool over him the same amount or maybe even more. Basil and Lord Henry can’t handle themselves when they are around Dorian. Your jaw will drop to the floor when you notice the underlying sexual innuendos from the 1980’s.<br />This book does a fantastic job of telling people to do the opposite of what the characters do. After all, men talk about women as their property. Actually, Dorian considers them prizes. In addition, the women in this book depend on the men to make them happy, like when Sibyl kills herself because Dorian no longer loves her.  Also, you will comprehend how beauty isn’t everything. In fact, you will realize that beauty can turn you into a monster. Also, those monsters can turn the whole world upside down, such as the picture changes from Dorian’s monstrosity.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This season made Doctor Who my favorite show of all time. Very well written and creative from start to finish.
B0032UYFA6|1.0|I love Season 3 of Breaking Bad and give the content of the show 5 stars.  However, the sound on Discs 1 and 2 of the Blu-Ray DVD version are not synchronized with the action.  This is very disconcerting.  It is like watching a foreign movie that is dubbed into English and the words are slightly off from the action.<br /><br />I am surprised that the manufacturers of the Blu-Ray DVD did not catch this technical error.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lots of fun our whole family plays together.  great way for our 9 year old to think strategy through.  recommend game
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Definitely a page turner even though many of the secrets where easy to anticipate. This book is well written and makes one think about love and marriage.<br />This is a great book club book.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|\\"IT\\" is one of Stephen King's best -if not the best novel -long but well worth \\"IT\\"... Just reading \\"IT\\" again and \\"IT\\" is just as good now as when I 1st read \\"IT\\" many, many years ago<br />You will enjoy \\"IT\\" PS: the movie does not do \\"IT\\" justice........
B004J4WLB4|5.0|My daughter introduced me to this author and her book.  I couldn't put it down.  It was one of those books that had your attention at the very beginning.  nicely done!  I will buy the hardback edition for my friends birthday.
B005HEPIDS|4.0|I've been a trekkie since a kid and wanted to see this series again after seeing available for streaming.  It's not HD quality because of the original recording (1999) but i enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|My daughters ages 3, 8, and 10 really like this movie!  There is something to entertain all of our ages.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|There is adrenaline, but not much else in this movie. The plot seemed predictable with a Hollywood ending. I would hope for more from Brad Pitt.
044654759X|5.0|Absolutely Fabulous read this one in 2 days. Nicolas sparks puts you right in the characters shoes with this one and I loved it. Every fearful tear jerking moment plays an intricate role in making this the great book that it is. I find that I am usually more a fan of his novels then movie adaptions and its because of books like this that you just cannot film the imagination and scope of his characters that he writes.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I love C.S. Lewis.  I haven't read this one yet, but I am confident in the quality to the journey to come.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell has done it again. I could not put the book down. I can't wait to read her next novel.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Hachi:  A Dog's Tale<br />I really enjoyed this heartwarming story about man's best friend.  Animals are wonderful with their unconditional love.  I am surprised that I only heard about it on Amazon Prime.  Children would love it too.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|The special effects were excellent. The acting was absolutely awful. I wish I had trusted the previous reviews that warned against renting this.
B000LB7G00|4.0|This basic model works well, getting used to it is not easy, it will take a couple of days of fiddling with it. Works in Freecad older versions of sketchup and in solidworks, Google earth and in a bunch of other applications with their universal drivers. I had a bit of a misconception though, this should not replace your mouse in these applications but supplement your control of the environment along with a standard mouse, in fact calling this a mouse would not be appropriate it is a 3d controller intended to be use by your other hand, that is the hand you don't use for your mouse while your primary hand remains at the mouse.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A well-done documentary about the causes of the 2008 recession.  Explains what happened clearly and honestly.  Thanks to all for undertaking this project.  A very good movie-
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thought the third book of the Hunger Games was bad (and it was), but compared to Allegiant, Mockingjay looks like a masterpiece. I'll never read this series again, definitely won't read her remaining books about Four, and now I probably won't see the movie either.
B005FITIGO|5.0|A compelling and well-done movie describing events related to the financial collapse of the 2008.  Excellent performances by all!  Everyone should own this movie!
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Great album. The guitar shreds are amazing and sick. Their older stuff is pretty hardcore and seems they tried something new.
B000V8A95C|5.0|I love the original Wicked soundtrack.  It's so dramatic and the vocals are amazing. I actually listened to the soundtrack before I saw the production and I fell in love with a few songs, which made seeing the play for the first time even more exciting.
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|My kid liked it. This movie is not big on plot or character development. If you like special effects and don't want to follow a long convoluted plot this is the movie for you.
0307577589|5.0|One of the best books I have ever gotten, I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't wait until the next book.  I am so sorry the author died, what a genius!
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|I've seen scarier commercials. If your looking for a scary movie I would skip this one. If your looking for a movie where you can say and next this will happen then this is the movie for you.
0739384171|5.0|I love this trilogy and was so sorry to hear Stieg Larsson had died, I would have enjoyed another series by him.  This was a great series a must read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was just looking for an easy read and was pleasantly surprised that I had a hard time putting this one down!  It had some twists and turns and really was a well written story!
0739384198|5.0|The last book by Stieg Larsson, one of the best Millennium Trilogy's I have ever read.  So sad he died after writing this series, can't<br />imagine how much we are missing.  Thank you Stieg Larsson.
B008EL25LE|4.0|This game was very fun however I like the first one better. I did not have problems with it wanting to force closure which is very nice not to deal with.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Too many plot holes and useless characters. Long stretches of exposition followed by rushed ending. Relationship between main characters never truly matured. No impression of &#34;hope&#34; at the end. Major conflicts solved too simply. Honestly, this book felt like a first draft.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun. I like to match things and play searching types of games. What gets on my nerves about his game is that if you use all of your lives up you have to wait for 20 minutes before you can again, well unless you PURCHASE lives.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Downloaded this game a few days ago and I can't put it down. So much fun! I highly recommend this game.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great price/performance value.  Have overclocked it to 4GHz using Intel Liquid Cooling Solution and still runs within published temperature limits.  I don't use the graphics so I can't comment on that. This is the CPU I used to build 3 dual-boot Win7/OSX &#34;Hackintosh&#34; systems, with Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H motherboards, and all are working fantastically.
0375507256|2.0|I guess it is ok if you can follow it... I had trouble sorting it all out.  I read for enjoyment and this was work.  Some will love this, some will hate it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game. Has a lot of fun and challenging levels. My mark down to 4 stars is the cost of specials and how few you get for what you pay.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Terrific book.  His best since &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;.  Fascinating trip through the intricacies of the legal system in relation to probate.
B00A2BTCM4|5.0|I've had this record since 1983 in various forms, from cassette to U.K. original pressing vinyl that I bought in Australia in the late 1980's, to CD in the early 90's. It's my favorite RUSH album. Then this came out. I put the 5.1 DVD into the stereo and there is NO noise, click, pop, wow, flutter, tape hiss anywhere in-between the tracks The dynamics are super solid, and the sound engineer who did the remaster worked magic with several of the tracks, by utilizing the 5.1 surround sound to  wrap the sounds of the fountains in &#34;Discovery&#34; around the listener. You actually feel like you are in the cave along with the guitarist. This is probably as close to perfect as you can get in the remastering of an analog classic like 2112.
B009JBZH54|5.0|who didn't love the batman trilogy? i bought this for some friends who really loved the nolan version of batman and they couldn't have been happier. easily a five star rating
B00E9P959O|4.0|I declined to buy Vapor Trails when it first came out because all the songs sounded the same and the dynamics just weren't there. Then, I listened to the remix, and it's like the album grew a third dimension - I can hear changing melody and variation that carry my ear through the whole recording and leaves me surprised and waiting for more on the last note of the last song. The remix of this album was a pleasant surprise!
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I see potential here, especially in Julie Andrews.  She has a fair voice and rosy cheeks.  Her dancing is impressive.  Her costume, especially the bonnet, is lovely.  The make-up, however, could be improved--too much soot on the forehead!  Is unbecoming for a lady.<br /><br />The two little twerps, in comparison, give dismal performances.  These two youngsters will need tremendous coaching, teaching, and molding if they ever hope to be stars, or even mature adults.  All of this bedwetting must end.  Unacceptable.  And Michael is too short for a boy of his age, stubborn, and suspicious.  Furthermore, the children exhibit poor manners, especially the character Michael, played by Matthew Garber, who causes a run at the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, an unprecidented event since the Boston Tea Party.<br /><br />Finally, although Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins has perfect posture and speech delivery, some of her methods are quite unconventional.  For example, it is quite inappropriate to approach an important job interview by umbrella.<br /><br />In sum, although Julie Andrews gives a commanding performance at times --> truly molding the British breed, at other times her lessons appear quite silly.
1936891026|5.0|This is a great read that helps you reflect on those things that are holding you back from reaching your true self in life!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Phenomenal this show always has you at the edge of your seat. The acting is superb.the writers keep you nail biting from start to finish
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Very good reading, easily understandable, excellent presented, I recommend this book must read. I rated this book on a scale of 1. To ten----- easily a 10
B0045INTVA|5.0|This story has quality, and I have heard comments by the soldiers who were in combat about how ridiculous this movie is.  Well not really.  I was Navy and we really did act like that.....
B000002LND|5.0|Great album...  Must have bought 4 times in my lifetime!<br />Madonna never ceases to amaze me....  She's really quite talented!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I think the world is a box with four corners each one of which you could get stuck careful which corner you paint yourself into
B00F1CRSKM|4.0|First disc 3 stars.  Second disc 5 stars for a 4 star rating.  Don't let the title track make up your mind on this album.  I simply adore the Suburbs and when I heard the song Reflektor I was like what the ****?  But this song did grow on me and the best part is there are at least 6-7 songs on this album that are better than the title track IMO, Joan of Arc, Normal Person, Your Already Know not being among them.  The first half of this album has a very bouncy feel to it and a lot of the songs sound like they came straight of The Clash's Sandinista!  Whether thats a good thing, you decide.  Some are great, We Exist being one of them and some unfortunately sound a little out of place as they are too heavy on the rasta techno-dub.  Calling this a double album is a hard for me to admit.  The  only reason it even qualifies is because the last track has about 5 minutes of  near inaudible noises at the end of it.  But considering the contrasting moods on each half, I will forgive the band on this as not a marketing ploy but more for physical separation of the two moods.  The disc would seem a little hodge podge had the songs been mixed up on one disc.  The 2nd disc is simply fantastic.  The cuban dance sound is dropped and the songs are much more intimate and artistic.  Euridice and Orpheus are amazing.  Over all I think this album would be a five star iif shortened to 10 tracks and the two sides were more cohesive without the heavy cuban influence.  But defintitly worth the money.  Just dont see this album aging quite as well as The Suburbs.  Reflektor is a close 2nd in the Arcade Fire catalog for this AF fan though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely Love this TV Series. it's one you should watch from the beginning to the end. what a wonderful UK Show...
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I am really enjoying this game, you can progress at a good rate. I love that the crops do not wither away.  My three year loves watching me play and picking out the crops.  I play throughout the day so if you want an active player add me with my id: FASYNDF

B003F5WOEC|4.0|great product and fast shipping.. thanks.....but where is the cd that was to come with the album.Thank you so much for this.
B000Q67876|5.0|One of the best movies of all time, a must have for your collection!  The characters and acting are just plain awesome!
B002S43V3Y|5.0|This is the best cult movie of all time. I show this movie to all my new friends. It helps them decide if they are comming back.
B004ZNACA6|3.0|Pink Floyd are such an important band and it's been such a long wait for a proper remaster of every album.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say though that my copy arrived with the liner notes to each cd pretty much stuck in with glue that ironically didn't seem to hold the actual cardboard packaging together. By the time I had very carefully taken the contents out I essentially had a pretty second hand looking boxed set. A bit of a let down to be honest.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of his best...couldn't wait to see how it would end...if you like Stephen King you will love this book...even though it is over 800 pages it reads fast.
0316055433|2.0|Beautifully written, in places, but a slog to an entirely predictable outcome.  The plot is as thin and easy to detect as a bad veneer and the characters are shallow, simplistic and overdrawn. Boris has some gemlike moments, but is much too erudite and long winded for a Ukrainian thug.  Hobie is a sweetheart but entirely unbelievable.  Theo is a bore and a not very nice one. Pippa seems to exist only as a plot device to be taken up and discarded as needed like a cleaning rag. Some of the descriptions of NYC are among the best I've ever read, but finding them amid the mind numbingly overwritten prose is like panning for gold - lot's of work, not a lot of reward.
B004GK2B6Q|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie. The graphics were great. It's not really for young children and at some points we found it hard to follow. But overall it was a good movie.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|I completely fell in love with this book. The narration is awesome and so detailed and one of the few good books I've read during my short life. I recommend this completely. The whole series of books actually.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|I give it No Stars. I was not able to watch it on Amazon on any of the 3 devices I own. You charged me for it and I was not able to view it. And your customer service has as of yet to return my email.
B009R89CRI|5.0|My 2 kids 13 yrs and 10 yrs, fight over this book!  They will lock each other up jus to get their hands on this book..its a funny sight to see these kids fightn and going all crazy for Diary of a Wimpy kid!
B002ZG981E|5.0|One of the gretes movies I have ever seen, it is orginal, un expected and very creative, I just love it
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Skyfall, in my opinion, is the best of the James Bond movie franchise. Yes it has all the prerequisite action and humor. But is also has deep emotional connection between the characters which is something most Bond movies don't have. Some say Daniel Craig is too old for the Bond character. I say he has grown into the character as his own.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love all lord of the rings saga and this as well, I think is greate the photografy and the history it was a greate adaptation from the book, can't wait to see the next.
B00CEF014E|3.0|the story felt like a rushed book.plot was really good but if it was more detailed you could get to know the characters better
B008J8KBKY|2.0|Tried this as the free app of the day and it was pretty boring to me.  Only played it for a few minutes and removed from Kindle.  It's not bad just not interesting and the graphics are meh

B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great series. Better than x files. The character Walter plays is really fascinating. While it can jump around some it maintains a constant plot to keep you coming back.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have not written a single verse in poetry except for when I was given an assignment in school. Reading this book made me realise what I have been missing out on. Poetry is such a beautiful and simple form of expressing emotion. I have actually started trying to write something that help me express myself better.<br />Everyone should read this book. This book has nothing to with romance, its about expressing yourself in more forms than a simple conversation... I hope everyone enjoys it!!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|It was scary as all hell! I'm a fan of the walking dead so this movie was great! Plus Brad Pitt... WOW!!

B00EJOCAYW|5.0|I finally got it. It took a while to get it though. Bought this as a gift. They seem to like it.
0671042858|5.0|This book is amazing. The story of Trisha was just amazing. I would recommend it to anyone. Its suspenseful, a little scary.
B005JVNRA0|5.0|super funny. not for children though due to the language and content. the story line also was very well written
B008CLI4N4|4.0|'Game of Thrones' is perfectly cast, splendidly acted, and excellently produced. It's very compelling and almost addictive with its intrigues and twists and turns. However, it's also so disturbingly violent that I've been forced to fast-forward through more and more of the scenes. I just can't sit through any more tortures and throat-cuttings. The fantasy universe of 'Game of Thrones' is so grim, selfish, and sadistic that it makes our ordinary human lives seem like a paradise by comparison, and this might be the series' chief virtue. It's a world nearly devoid of compassion. Even the most 'soft-hearted' characters in the series (and there aren't many) have a pathological lust for power and seem to thrive on terrible vengeance and killing. I'm fine with nudity and with explicit sexuality if it's caring, but the sex scenes in 'Game of Thrones' are seldom loving ones, and this bothers me too.<br /><br />I read most of the George R.R. Martin novels on which the series is based. I finally had to stop reading them when there was yet another murder of a character I'd come to care about. I'll probably keep following the series to some extent, but I'm not going to watch any more scenes of grotesque violence if I can help it. Too much is too much.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is just amazing the graphics are the best I have seen for a kindle game I just wish you could get money and cars easier
0802473156|5.0|This book is complete with a test to take to find not only your love language, but that of those you love.  It's particularly helpful in making suggestions as to how to best love someone with a language different from you own.

B00G32MPWU|4.0|It was your typical grind-house movie, but worth watching and would recommend to most everyone...with the exception of children because there is a lot of violence.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is a lot of fun I really enjoy playing it. Is very entertaining and can keep you occupied for hours would highly recommend it to others. There is not one single thing that I do not like about this game. Tons and tons of fun
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Wonderful book.  It really gives you a feel about how life was in the early 20's - not just 1927 but the years leading up to the events that happened that summer.  Mr. Bryson touches on a myriad of wonderful subjects and personalities of the time, including Babe Ruth, Henry Ford and Herbert Hoover.  He covers the beginnings of radio and even television and the book is beautifully written.  I highly recommend it.
B00ELD3MUW|5.0|This was very usefull in installing other  programs.  Really appeciated this, because I hae this on my LAPTOP COMPUTER.  Great purchase.
B002NVELDQ|5.0|Since this show aired - I have loved it.  This is the New York way in the 50's and 60's.  Very realistic, scenes, vehicles, clothing and totally like the time era.  The storyline is also very good.  Sure it is romance and romance and a shame that the men &#34;think so little of the women.&#34;  It still goes on today and it is the nature of people and sex drives all......
006202406X|1.0|Ms. Roth... I am heartbroken. I'm heartbroken to the point of depression. I have laid in bed now for an hour, thinking and rethinking my decision to get so invested in your books. You held my breath since the first chapter of Divergent and didn't let go. I feel like you've strangled me, maimed me, ripped out my heart and replaced it with ice. It hurts Veronica, and I will never read another book you write again. You could have done so much with this book and you chose to go back to \\"abnegation\\" teachings as your ending, instead of completing the story the right way. They could have done a bonnie and clyde and I would have been so happy, but you placed me in Tobia's shoes and now I feel like I can not unfeel these feelings. You made me care about a character only to offer her up like a lamb. Martyrs are great in a one book series... not a trilogy. I'm so disappointed and grieving. This was not a good ending Ms. Roth, this was trash. To put it lightly for those out there contemplating reading the finale of this trilogy -DONT. Very similar to the LOST ending.<br /><br />Points about writing style- which I was ignoring due to the fact of how much I loved these character, You're first mistake was taking away the female lead character. I already cared about Tobias from Tris point of view - I did not have to be inside his head. This was a messy messy book, writing was all over the place and it felt like it stuttered. Became repetitive with action sequences and \\"plot\\" twists becoming<br /><br />You have forever lost a reader. I buy and support YA authors by buying around 4-5 series a year. You will never get another penny from me.<br />Be Brave.<br />-Sera
B00459EZLW|5.0|Never watched a Stargate series before this one...  But this show is AWESOME!  Would love it if that terribly named network would bring it back for a few new adventures!
B000VUCIZE|4.0|Sam Harris is an extremely intelligent man, a great debater and an accomplished writer.<br />The obvious criticism one might make is that he is preaching to the choir (please forgive the pun), that is, if you buy a book with this title, the chances are you are not going to be a rabbi or a suicide bomber about to die for Allah...  so my opinions might not mean that much to some.<br />The areas of discourse are well presented and logically argued, he emphasizes the irrationality and danger of blind faith without proselytizing (not an easy feat) and encourages the reader to look inside.  I found it refreshing that he tackled such topics as the the concept of 'I' and non-faith based spiritualism - both extremely worthy of contemplation but not frequently considered in atheist literature.<br />I would have given the book 5 stars if he had put more of his wit into the book - a capacity he has proven time and again in YouTube clips...  this was his first and I will definitely read through his canon to see if this area of his style develops.<br />If you buy it, enjoy it!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Started playing for fun,  then it really got crazy when I play with family n friends! Pepole of all ages will love this game!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I have been a David Baldacci fan for years, but I had not read a couple of his older works. It was good to find out how King and Maxwell got together.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My whole family loves this game, the graphics are great on my kindle and its fun!! The only thing I don't like this that it starts out free but then u have to pay to enter new levels after the first few
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|what a disappointment.  It's truly sad to see someone that had soooo much potential put out songs unworthy of herself.  After the B.T.W. release.....there wasn't much substance to follow, and now here we go again.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Loved this book - especially the idea of taking pictures of vacation collectables and then getting rid of them.  What a wonderful way to keep the memory and not the stuff.  She is so right about clutter attracting clutter.  I have spent several weeks keeping surfaces clear and the moment I let my guard down with an item or two, five more will gather quickly around it.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|A truly original, engrossing and fun read!  I would love to find more books like this.  This is entertainment at its best.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|DC does it again! This show had been absolutely fantastic. This is the best show I have ever watched on tv. I don't see how I didn't hear about this earlier even though people have been telling me to watch it for a year now. It is so worth it. They bring in so many new villains and new stories and it's just well written. You will not be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting plot twists and psychological warping. Writing itself could be more polished however. Now seven more words to meet minimum.
B008JFUR10|5.0|If you are a fan of transformers then this would be great for you. I personally like it a lot better. The monsters are way more intense and each one is totally different than the other. The beginning is a little slow but it puts the metal to the floor once it really starts.
B003L77GRO|4.0|Excellent. I really enjoyed the show and the product was very satisfactory. It was sealed nicely and in great condition.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I normally hate Zombie movies because I have a tough time suspending reality during them. I only watched it because I respect the acting of Brad Pitt and Mireille Enos. I loved the characters Thomas (Fabrizio Guido) for being such a caring suvivor and Segen (Daniella Kertesz) for being such a tough suvivor.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|For a 99cent book, this was a good find. Right from the beginning this book held my interest and kept me reading. A bit gory as the author describes HOW the killer murders his victims, but a good read nonetheless.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I thought it would be &#34;Men in Black&#34; takeoff and it was. I wanted a fantasy and did not expect too much so I enjoyed the ride.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I DID like this book a lot, until the ending.  Wife goes missing on her 5th anniversary. Each chapter alternated between the perspective of the wife, and the perspective of the husband.  You literally get 2 different stories.  It went between the past and the present, but then the stories merged.  The narratives were very good and held my interest, but then, at the ending, you're going to ask yourself &#34;why&#34;?  After all that happened, why did the particular character do what they did.  Left me hanging.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Absolutely Love It! It is easy to set up. It works great. The only downside is that it is not HD. It is 720. This is not an issue for me and at $35 it can hardly be called a complaint. But it works flawlessly. You do need Chrome so make sure you have the Chrome Browser.<br />When I plugged it into the back of my Samsung, my laptop's wi-fi immediately recognized it. It took a few minutes for Chromecast to update itself to the latest software update but that was it. Now I click the upper righthand icon and I am watching Netflix on my big screen TV. The sound comes through the TV so Netflix is no different than HBO.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my favorite game on Facebook so glad I can get it on my Kindle Graphics and sound are perfect. I just wish I was better at it
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Such a sweet story! I ran through it in just two days. It was fascinating to spend time in Kendall's world of celebrity life. Can't wait for the next book!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son and husband love this app. It looks great on the kindle and the size of the screen makes it awesome
1623650003|5.0|What a great thriller!  This is Lemaitre's second story in his trilogy, but the first to be translated to English.<br /><br />When police receive reports of a female being abducted on the streets of Paris, they start an investigation into the abduction, first trying to even understand who was taken.  How could no one have reported this woman missing?  How will they find and rescue her?  As the investigation proceeds, the story continues to grow in complexity.<br /><br />The story takes interesting turns throughout and keeps you guessing each step.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works very well with the kindle while browsing the web. Opens quickly and has most of the full version features.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Excellent book about diet and exercise. I have been following the program and I'm seeing huge changes in my body.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Fun and addictive, this oddball would be worth paying for If it wasn't the free app of the day. Lots of gameplay to do, too.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt is an amazing author! The characters and storyline just jump off the page. I could not put this book down and am giving it as a gift to several people this Christmas.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This is the best show, best writing, best acting of any show that has ever been on TV.  Now I can't wait for Season 3!
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Great movie!  Based on a true story of the 1972 Olympic games and terrorist crisis.  A lot of action and drama as well.  I would strongly recommend this movie.
B00G32OMF8|1.0|All talk, and trite at that, and no dramatic tension or new revelations about relationships.  The acting was mediocre, like the script.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Spending a little too much time on Facebook, tweeting what you had for lunch, not wondering how much info Google really has about you?  Maybe it's time you read this book.<br /><br />The concept is not new and has been written in other novels.  Tracking people, knowing what they are doing, validating them and being validated through them.  Social control and more.<br /><br />Eggers does this especially well, though.  Don't get bogged down in the technical aspects, don't dismiss the novel because it doesn't fit into your world view, just enjoy it.  This requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but for the most part, I could go with it.  (I especially didn't like the deep sea animal part, both because of lack of accuracy that wasn't explained away as new technology, and of the imagery it brought to mind.)<br /><br /> I thought one short bit was a little on the preachy side.  The characters for the most part are not likable and become less so, quite a natural progression and important to the story.  The story has no great surprises.  Still, it captured and kept my interest throughout.  Yes, it is a cautionary tale, but entirely entertaining.<br /><br />I was given an advance copy of this book for review.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|It is January 1944 and WWII hangs in the balance. Enter Commander Ian Fleming of the Naval Intelligence Department. Yeah, that Ian Fleming. The author, Damien Stevenson, deposits the reader directly into the great 'what if' fashion of history. Stevenson has a terrific eye for detail borne out of what must have been an extensive period of research. He uses noir elements to enrich this rich historical thriller.<br />I must admit to never having been much of a Bond fan. Oh, of course, as a kid, I enjoyed the Bond romps. But as I got older I trended away from them. But Operation Parsifal is right up my alley. History is balanced with mystery and intrigue all the while spiced up with suspense. This leads up to a smashing climax.<br />To sum up, this is a gripping historical thriller. If you are a Bond fan you'll be thankful that the author has brought a level of authenticity to a tale you are already gripped by. Still, even if you are not on the Bond bandwagon, this novel will hold your attention from beginning till end. Highly recommended!!
B0027UY8B8|4.0|Excellent packaging.  Excellent video quality.  One disc had a 5 minute section that wouldn't play.  The disc wasn't scratched so it must be some kind of coding error at the factory.  Well worth the money.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The book had me hooked and hard to put down. The characters were brought to life and the ending was not what you were expecting at all! A must read!!
B002B790YC|4.0|I love Burt Lancaster but this was one strange movie. The protagonist's life is slowly revealed in an ever saddening plot. You can fill in most of the pieces by the end, and it's not a pretty picture. A sad, sad commentary on how a life can unravel.
B005LAII4E|5.0|My kids loved this.  Lots of action and keeps them on their toes.  They watch it over and over again.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|A classic-so very well made and perfect for kids of all ages. They need more movies like this. My 4 and 5 year old grandchildren love this.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Another good childs movie.  My little boy watches it over and over again.  It is very entertaining and I would recommend for any little boy.
B00ADQPA38|4.0|it was one of the best series I've seen in a long time I would recommend this to anybody. the story is good and the characters are great
6304698623|5.0|Bought as a gift for a special little girl and she loved it.  I would recommend it for all little girls.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It kept you interested all the way through it.  The author helped us remember that time of history in an accurate light (not only the most pleasant times)  The twists and turns of this plot were excellently unfolded.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is one of my favorites and I watch it over and over again.  I am a romatic at heart.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|I wanted to love this movie, I really did. I love the idea of the remakes that are coming out but unfortunately, they tend to fall short.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have had so much fun playing the game.  My granddaughter can even open the game and play it also
B008JFUO36|5.0|I loved this movie. Tom Cruise may be crazy, but he can act. The story was great and the images were hauntingly beautiful. I also love listening to the soundtrack while I'm working.
B008EKMB82|5.0|This book is so beautifully written and plotted. Nao's is a irrepressible voice; she is an adolescent in Japan determined to end her miserable life, but her drive to record her sad story in an elaborate journal keeps her alive. Ruth, on the other side of the Pacific living on a remote island in British Columbia, is reading Nao's  journal trying to complete her own impossible memoirs but deriving her life force from Nao.  A truly wonderful read full of rich language. My favorite book this year.
B00AF82WTO|4.0|I loved the DVD because the story is my favorite Jane Austen. However, I did not care for how they did the part where she gets his letter.  It was not plausible and a lot of the emotion was lost. But Wentworth and Anne were perfect.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I am not an &#34;Eat Pray Love&#34; reader. In fact, I avoided that book because of it's self-help, chick-lit vibe. This book is not that book. Alma Whitaker is a brilliant deviant. So compelling and complex. I loved reading her story and I really enjoyed Elizabeth Gilbert's use of 19th-century lingo to tell her story. I recommend this book to anyone who likes rich character-driven plotting.
