B00005JKES|1.0|The 1 star isn't for the quality of the show, but for the stupid decision of the manufacturer not to include the pilot episode. Anyone who wants to view the series in order should NOT buy this set, but wait until some day when they are smart enough to release the whole first season, including the pilot.
B00005JKO9|5.0|Warren Beatty gives a staggering performance, not only in a difficult lead role but as producer, director and screenwriter, after this film Beatty seemed to rest on his laurels, with a few brief exceptions.  Diane Keaton is also strong, although I think basically miscast.  She is many things but not a femme fatale on the Louise Bryant line, and the picture fails to show why Reed and Eugene O'Neill (not to mention her first husband!) were all so hot for her.  Nicholson is ok as Eugene O'Neill, really a rather underwritten part.  He seems to be playing O'Neill as though O'Neill was a sailor character from THE LAST DETAIL, endlessly skulking over the waterfront.  Stephen Sondheim's glorious, somewhat sardonic anthem shows why this Broadway composer should be writing more for the movies.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this film came out back in 1981.  When it opened, it seemed as though it might usher in an era of intelligent historical epics about the American experience.  History has taught us otherwise.  Yes, the \\"American experience\\" for even though the movie is much concerned with the Bolshevik Revolution, and much of the film is set in Russia, it is largely concerned with how Americans took the news of a revolution on the other side of the world.<br /><br />What would we want from the DVD version of REDS?  That's a question with an easy answer.  And it would be the best extra of the year.  Simply present the unedited testimony of the so-called \\"Witnesses\\" of the film.  The best part of the movie was seeing, in plain black and white, and so elegantly photographed, actual men and women who were alive before WWI and who (mostly) remembered Bryant and Reed or other Village intellectuals. In REDS their appearances are sometimes frustrating curtailed, in order, of course, to serve the dramatic arc of the movie as a whole.  I'd love to see the enedited footage.  These \\"witnesses\\" include many who are gone now--indeed I wonder if any of them could still be alive, for the youngest of them was about 80 when the film was shot!  And some of them were geniuses in their own right--Henry Miller, Rebecca West, Will Durant, Scott Nearing, as well as some of the most endearing personalities of the century.  I'm crossing my fingers that Paramount is working this up.the youngest of them was about 80 when the film was shot!

B000002J09|5.0|Death's too good for anyone who doesn't like Zeppelin. Zeppelin totally kick @ss! If you buy this album you won't ever need  another rock album ever, excpet for anything by Zeppelin. It's so good that you'll play it constantly for the rest of your life. I know I do. Don't buy anything buy other bands. Zeppelin are IT. Zeppelin are so superior to other bands it's scary. Combine  all the talent in other bands and it still wouldn't be as much as in Jimmy Page's litte finger. The only other albums I listen to are Zeppelin, 1 Zeppelin 2,Zeppelin 3 and Physical Graffitti by Zeppelin.

0897500482|5.0|Take it as you want...this book started it all. Everyone is definitely titled to your own opinion. And this is what makes Jeet Kune Do, what it is, a \\"nameless\\" art. To name it is what it is... but in reality, it doesn't exist. You make your own conclusion. You make your own system. You are your own Jeet Kune Do. Lee Jun Fan (Bruce Lee) was definitely way ahead of his time. It is what makes Mixed Martial Arts what it is today. But to name your style a specific style... then it is not Jeet Kune Do. It is not how you know what your strengths are...it is how you know your weaknesses. This is what this and Lee's other books have taught me. As well as other JKD and Martial Arts books. Respect All...Fear None.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|It is either that Michael Mann is a real movie stylist or that he knows exactly which cinematographer to hire.  Heat is still my personal favorite: Collateral is highly entertaining itself, but Heat is more hypnotic.  What is most memorable about Collateral, at least to me, is all that driving at night and all that conversation between strangers taking place in the dark of the night, and that alone was worth two hours of my time.  You see, I used to travel on business constantly, constantly fighting with the flight attendants and a variety of other airline employees, and the only time I was at peace was when I was on my way home, riding in a cab or driving in the middle of the night.  I was alone and most peaceful, almost hopeful, and this movie took me back to that place, which was in a strange way a very good place.

B00003CXTG|3.0|As a film showing a significant event in American history and how it affected many peoples' lives forever, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is without a one star movie. But as an overblown but entertaining piece of eye candy filled with dazzling scenery and impressive special effects that only Michael Bay can provide, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a five star movie. These two points taken into account, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is about a 3 1/2 star movie.<br /><br />Like most of Bay's films, (\\"Bad Boys\\", \\"Armageddon\\") \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a pointless film with lots of action and well known stars to keep you interested (the only one of Bay's film that had a real plot was \\"The Rock\\"), as it's loaded with ear-shattering special effects and well known faces like Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jon Voigt (whose performance as FDR ranks as possibly the worst portrayal of a president ever to be commited to film), Colm Feore, Jennifer Garner and Alec Baldwin. As sung in the recent \\"Team America: World Police\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\" misses the point it's trying to bring across, and works as eye candy and nothing else. The story's main focus is on two soldiers (Affleck, Hartnett) either fighting for the love of a pretty nurse (Beckinsale) or playing with their 25 foot toys. Hartnett is about as appealing as wet paint, and while Affleck gets to do some good physical humor during an exam, he otherwise gives another going - through - the - motions performance. The only actors who put in decent performances are Baldwin and Gooding (who as sung in \\"Team America\\" really did need a bigger part).<br /><br />This film is a good film visually, but otherwise is an unsufferably tedious and rediculous movie that has no redeeming qualities aside from some good acting. Definitely a rental - only movie.
B0002W4SWC|2.0|I haven't read the book, but cannot understand the wild popularity of  Bridget Jones based on the movie. I'm all for a movie that champions a \\"regular girl\\" but the movie version of Bridget?  She has the luck of landing great jobs in competitive fields for which she's totally unqualified and inept, she's alcoholic and her vocabulary rivals that of an uneducated hooker. She doesn't try to educate herself or prepare properly for her jobs; she just wants to lose a few pounds and grab her guy. And yet, one of the sharpest legal minds in the country finds her fascinating? Uh huh.     BTW, how Fielding had the guts and thought to pull in even tongue-in-cheek references to Pride and Prejudice is beyond me. This has absolutely nothing to do with P&P. Bridget is the antithesis of Elizabeth Bennett.     Zellweger actually looks better at he more normal Bridget weight, but she is by no means an overweight Bridget. She does her usual cute mugging for the camera and can handle a semi-decent British accent. I just wish she had made the character a more sympathetic and likable.     I actually was put off by the language in the film, something that rarely happens when I watch a movie. I'm not offended by swearing in films, but soooo many repetitions of the \\"F\\" word--of ANY word-- starts getting ridiculous and annoying. The movie tries too hard to cram in edgy \\"adult\\" humor that actually comes off as painfully juvenile and boring. It takes away from the film and from Bridget herself. She winds up looking like a simpleton who keeps her mind constantly in the gutter.     The only scene I found funny in the whole film was the fight scene. I'll give a star to that. It was amusing. Most of the movie, however, just kept me rolling my eyes and yawning. And wanting to tell Bridget to go to AA and enroll in a college course. And wanting to tell Darcy to cut and RUN before it's too late and he winds up with a Bridget who is a few years from turning into her bore of a mother.    I'm not charmed.
0385338686|1.0|I loved \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" by this same author. But, this book does not live up to that book, at all. I just couldn't get into this book. I read the first two chapters and just had to put it away. (I skimmed through the rest of book and read the last couple of chapters to see if I was going to miss anything. Apparently not.)<br /><br />The book has a simple premise: an up-and-coming lawyer in a big law firm makes a mistake, can't deal with the consequences, and just walks out of her office (right before party to celebrate her promotion.) She happens to wander around like a zombie until she lands in a house where they are interviewing for housekeepers. She gets the job (even though she has no \\"domestic\\" skills) and, in the end, makes some decisions on what she wants out of life.<br /><br />I had several issues with this book, beginning with the fact that the plot is completely unrealistic. Yes, I realize that this is fiction and I must suspend belief. However, how can a girl that doesn't know that a vacuum cleaner has a bag end up being a great cook and housekeeper? *** SPOILER ALERT *** And the ending is unbelievable -- a woman who just walks away from her job, drops off the face of the earth, and takes no responsibility for her actions ends up getting offered a promotion. C'mon!! A big law firm like that would never even offer a person their job back, let alone hand them a partnership. I understand its fiction, but give readers some credit.<br /><br />I also hated the message in this book: it makes it seem like she has to give up her career completely to be happy. There is not middle ground according to Kinsella? She worked so hard to be this successful lawyer, and is very intelligent and talented. She acts completely out of character when she realizes that she made an error. Kinsella does not explain the change in character at all.<br /><br />I felt that the main character was very weak and the situations in the book very contrived. Typically, I don't like books where the main character runs away from her problems and lies to everyone all the time. It's just frustrating. And the \\"romance\\" aspect of the plot is pretty contrived -- the man she loves hates lawyers (naturally, he has had a bad experience in his past with a lawyer) so she can't tell him the truth. Oh, please.<br /><br />I had no respect or sympathy for her at all. This book really reminded me of \\"Confessions of a Shop-o-holic\\" in that the main character is unlikable and irresponsible.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" by this author -- that book features a sympathetic, likable main character with realistic (and funny) situations.runs away from her problems and lies to everyone all the time.

B00005JMFQ|3.0|Update: Although not a \\"Yank UKphile,\\" Peter Sutherlands challenge to go to amazonuk to check the reviews sparked my interest, so I took him up on it. The \\"starrage\\" there is even lower than it is on the U.S. site and the first reviews I saw were titled \\"Utter Rubbish\\" and \\"Awful Film.\\" Then I saw \\"Richard Curtis, You are Now Giving British Cinema a Bad Name.\\" That seemed to be a repeated sentiment on the site. So much for the British being in love with this film. Some liked it, but many, many did not.      It takes a fleeting attention span and a lot of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this film. It needs an editor. I found myself wanting to see a lot more of some of the little snippets of the eight stories crammed in, and a lot less of others. Just as I was getting into a storyline I liked (hilarious Billy Mac, for example), wanting to see more, the movie would switch to some mundane, fomulaic sitcom story (Mr. Prime Minister Hugh Grant usual schtick or kid who doesn't seem to care that he just lost his mother--he just wants to hook up with the school babe)  The characters are given so little attention, they come off as superficial and the storylines absolutely unbelievable. The film is forced to rely on embarrassingly simplistic stereotypes and silly sentimentality instead of sharp humor and unique looks at love in modern times.     I wasn't bothered by the nudity, language or even the slam at U.S. politicians (Does anyone actually believe the Billy Bob character WAS just George Bush? C'mon. And, if this movie had come out during the Clinton administration, you guys would be singing its praises - don't be hypocritical. Plus, American media is constantly poking fun at British politicians, royals, etc. We should be able to take a little ribbing ourselves).  I just thought it should have been smarter and more engaging.    I'm a little surprised at some of the reviews that either knock or tout this as being clearly British, because my thought when I saw it was that this film tried to be just British enough, but in reality was way too Hollywood. A British friend of mine cringes at this film and said to make it clear that it is not a true representation of the British. I absolutely love some of Richard Curtis' earlier work (Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings), but the newer films (this one, Notting Hill), seem to play to a market that wants a bit of quasi-British flavor, but mostly standard Hollywood junk. Actors well-known to Americans, glamourous model looks and no personality for the lead actresses, simplistic storylines, yuppie-esque sets. It's a real shame.     This is worth a rent and a viewing with the fast-forward button ready. But, it leaves a lot to be desired.
0385338082|5.0|I hated the \\"Shop-o-holic\\" books, so I thought I was hate this one, as well. Someone recommended it to me, so I got it from the library. I LOVED IT!!! I ended up staying up all night to finish it. The main character is likable and sympathetic. The hero is dashing and sexy. The side characters are fun to read. A lot of books claim to be the next \\"Bridget Jones\\" but this is one of the few that can actually be put in that category. Not to be missed!!
B000003TA9|4.0|Dirty is the best example of Sonic Youth under a major label. This album, unlike those preceding it, isn't a collection of songs that have a central feel to them. It's just a collection of songs, most of them good. This album is also the most basically song structured album, another result of them signing with Geffen. Some of the highlights off of the album are the incredibly catchy Sugarkane, the political Chapel Hill, and their single 100%.
B00007G1ZC|3.0|You have to appreciate having a unique perspective to enjoy this movie.  I always remembered the title as being A.K. Strange Dreams, because they are just that.  Some leave you smiling and others leave you oddly displaced by their turn of events.  You are left to interpret your own \\"moral of the story\\" and regardless of the unusual role play, the vividness of imagery and imagination he creates is worth watching.  I recognized the pattern of each dream growing from childhood to old age, and likened it to the progression of life itself, in spite of the \\"strange\\" circumstances that come our way.
B000002KXV|5.0|I love to put this one on in the wee-hours. Fagen's on the cover dee-jaying at 4:10am wearing a tie. He's serious about his music. Much like the cover this album is a bit over the top but somehow that only seems to add to its appeal. \\"I.G.Y.\\" and \\"The New Frontier\\" explore nuclear nightmares and utopian fantasies, \\"just in case the Reds decide to push the button down\\" he explains. \\"We've got provisions and lots of beer\\".  The hidden gems on this are \\"The Goodbye Look\\" and my favorite track \\"Maxine\\". \\"Maxine\\" may be the most retro song on the album. The somber piano introduction beckons you into a smokey lounge where the saxophone solo accomponies you on a dance amongst your dreams. On the title track \\"The Nightfly\\" he sings \\"You say there's a race of man in the trees? You're for tough legislation. I've waited all night for calls like this.\\" Yeah this is album is out there, but it's halarious,witty and charming. Basically this is a Donald Fagen masterpiece.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Few CDs will you ever enjoy as much as Marquee Moon. It definitely takes you back to the days of pre-powder puff music when \\"raw\\" actually meant raw. Television is a band with which numerous bands have been compared and the use of the word \\"derivative\\" has all too often the result. That 99% of the people you know have never heard of these guys is a crime, but part of me selfishly loves to keep this melodious recording secret. Nearly the entire album is Methadrine powered; yet it glides and never jams. I listen to it in the car, but, only now, have I gotten to the point where I can complete work while it plays. As for the lead singer, Verlaine was cool in a non-rehearsed way like few are today. If, perhaps, you've never heard Marquee Moon, play a few sample tracks and I bet you'll find that you agree with my assessment.
B000002UAX|5.0|When describing the whiteness of \\"Moby Dick\\" Melville writes \\"Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-white fog, Yea while these terrors seize us...\\" There is a  strange sense of terror about this album. Much like the great whale this leviathan of an album containing 30 tracks, has a strange hypnotic spectral terror to it. The beauty of this album lies in the fact that the Beatles released almost all of the material written during there 1968 retreat to India allowing the fans to edit as they liked. Although most will agree that this album is a mixture of the extrordinary and  the preposterous, the amazing thing is that no two people can come to a consensus on exactly which songs are which. \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is perhaps my favorite song on the album. After investing months of their time, money and trust in the Mahirishi the fellas came to the realization that their spiritual guide may not have been quite as holy as he professed. What did they do about it? Well write a song of course. Whether John is serious or not is hard to say but if he is serious then this song is even more wondrous and hilarious. Over a haunting piano melody John croons \\"Sexie Sadie , you'll get yours yet...\\" while the boys sing back-up in a comical harmonious doo-wop style that contrasts vastly with the weighty subject matter. While Paul drops a heavy bass line George ends the song with a wailing guitar solo that trumps Lennons' piano work in its sinister tone. Some may consider this song to be pure silliness though. The entire album is somewhat of an apparition with different songs seeming to take on different shapes and forms. Songs coming to the fore-front while others receed in the mind only to reappear prominantly later depending on the mood of the listener. An astonishing album.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|When I purchased Avril Lavinge's 1ST CD \\"LET GO,\\" I expected to find all this talent everyone was talking about [plus the songs \\"Complicated\\" and \\"I'm with you\\" happened to another reason to buy it]. But like I mentioned in my \\"Evenanesnce\\" review, all her music that was top quality (excluding the poppy ballad \\"Sk8ter Boi\\") was all the beginning of the CD. The girl can play a guitar but as far as singing and lyric writing goes, she just the ticket for tweenagers POP/ROCK non-singing. From there I knew the CD would just get worse (and it did).      When announced that Avril's 2ND CD would be coming out soon in 2004, I wasn't impressed by what I heard (a.k.a., \\"DON'T TELL ME\\" the third Track on her UNDER MY SKIN). The trouble was, I ended up getting the blasted CD for Christmas. Talk about ironic, no? Afterward, I listened to UNDER MY SKIN all the way through; The CD is a \\"so-so.\\" I don't know why would-be artists would release a less than great 1st CD and then decide to go for the teendrama style \\"Darker and Angsty\\" type music, then tabloids use the words like \\"________ \\"insert name here\\" grows up with her/his second album.\\" As thought they've matured over the span of their hiatus in the music industry). Moving on, U.M.S. was not a bad CD. On the contrary it was quite enjoyable to listen to, however it still follows the natural formula of other POP music singers [A): Singing about break ups, B): How much of a jerk this male the female was dating was and how she shoves it in his face how much she's over him or vice versa, C): How tainted this person has become or is, D): DRAMA-DRAMA, and so on].        1. \\"Take Me Away\\", is probably the best song on this CD, it starts of with a sort of backward sound-affect and thing continues onward with actual rock music that suffices and pleases. 5/5        2. \\"Together\\" Is another average break up song. I've listened to it more than once and still cannot get in the feel of it. The lyrics aren't the greatest and the instrumentsused in the song didn't really go with them either. 2/5        3. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" The first worse song and radio aired song from the CD. Its what I've described above and really the lyrics and music tries to dive too deep into the angst and drama that is \\"break up songs.\\" 1/5        4. \\"He Wasn't\\" Now here's a song that's worth getting down to. The most listened to song on the CD, \\"He wasn't\\" follows the same formula that \\"Don't Tell me\\" and \\"Together\\" does, but focus much more on things that happen around this pretentious \\"male\\" described in the song. The nineties rock style music is the coolest and highly in enjoyable. 5/5        5. \\"How Does It Feel\\" This is a song, I barely listened to because it was so boring. I've got nothing much to say about except that is has redundant lyrics and its not very entertaining. 1/5      6. \\"My Happy Ending\\" . . . And behold! The most overplayed and overused \\"Break up\\" song in all of teendrama television history (Even the unrightfully canceled \\"Tru Calling\\" used it, though in a different formula). I used to really enjoy this song because of --- not the flimsy lyrics---- but the instrumental music in the background amongst Avril's singing. It was nicely done by the band members and it is what made the song widely popular, not the lyrics. 3/5        7. \\"Nobody's Home\\" Is probably my third favorite song on the CD. It was nicely done in terms of Music AND LYRICS (it had nothing to do with \\"Break up\\" or \\"Jerk Boys\\", but the other). Plus it wasn't too long in terms of length. 4/5        8. \\"Forgotten\\" (\\"But I was forgotten, I'll never be forgotten, never again!\\") That's probably the most catchiest phrase in the entire song. \\"Forgotten\\" is another non-favorite song of mine, I really found it hard to get into the song as it progressed. Its not bad, it  just wasn't the coolest song on this CD, next to the others. 3/5        9. Who Knows; 4/5  10. Fall to Pieces 2/5  11. Freak Out 3/5  12. Slipped Away 5/5      All in all, I enjoyed AvrilLavinge's UNDER MY SKIN. It was better than I expected it to, in more ways than one. However, I just hopes she takes another route than P!NK did with her third release. Otherwise she'll end up on the bottom pile with the once pink-haired rapper, Jennifer Lopez, Mya, Christina Agulerra(?) and others that figured the \\"SATURATED SEXY\\" look would get them someplace besides the bottom of a bottle. ----- [a 3 out of 5]
B000A88F22|5.0|this is a kool show it really show's how britney is, and how she can be a kool person.people think oh she's so nasty and everything but so what everyone is like that and i respect her for showing that on television it just shows that she is not afraid of what people think of her and that is a good thing, because if your afraid of what people think it will bring you down. so i think you should get this espescially if your looking at these reveiws cuz if you are then that means you like britney in some way. in the dvd it will include the someday video the making of it bonus material not shown in the show and a bonus cd that has her songs chaotic and someday. the show is very different from other reality shows it seems much more real and much more like her. i really love the episode with her wedding it was very kool. i  think Britney and Kevin were meant for each other. Britney seems so happy with Kevin. but Britney is still hot even though she's pregnant.
B000024ZLX|4.0|Pink Floyd is my favorite rock band of all time, so I DO love this album.  When I was in college, I would play this album and take a few drinks every time I felt depressed (which was a LOT).  Don't worry, I'm better now. <br /> <br />The album may say Pink Floyd on it, but it is clearly Roger Waters' music.  One can't help but feel sorry for the other three members of the band, as it seems they were practically forced to go along with everything Roger wanted.  Even when we hear David Gilmour singing \\"Not Now John\\" (great song, by the way), you can almost hear him saying \\"This is not what I wanted to do\\" in the background.  Like the Beatles, it seems this was their \\"Let It Be\\" album before the four of them split for good. <br /> <br />Now that their LIVE 8 set is history, I hope they will continue the momentum and stay together for a tour.
B00005JNSK|2.0|Johnny Depp normally turns me away from movies.  However, Depp's performance in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" was enough to give me reason to cut the guy some slack.  This movie almost takes up all that slack.  But upon reflection, it wasn't Depp's performance that kept me from enjoying this film; it was the slow moving pace of the film itself. <br /> <br />I can tell you that this is a fair remake of the classic.  I can tell you second hand that this is a fair version of the original stories by Roald Dahl.  Unfortunately, I can't suggest that you see this film, at least not in theatres. <br /> <br />Among it's many problems is how nothing interesting happens in the film.  There are some interesting special effects, and there are some interesting twists and spin-offs from the original film.  But the only thing I got from this film was fatigue.  I remember at one point wanting to walk out of the theatre due to boredom. <br /> <br />However, I must admit that I was in the minority on this film.  When the film was over, it received applause in that Midwestern theatre.  I suggest waiting to rent or own.  This movie's above average special effects will work well on a small screen as they do on a large one. <br />
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is the album that really kicked gangsta rap into the main stream.  Dr. Dre came along and had tons of success with The Chronic but honestly I think a lot of people thought it was a fluke.  When Snoop Dogg released 'Doggstyle' it did 2 things.  First, it proved that Dr. Dre is no fluke, period.  Second, it showed that rap mixed with RnB can be not only radio friendly but great to listen to.  My personal favorite is 'Murder was the Case' although Gin and Juice got much more air play.  Unfortunately none of Snoop's albums since has been at this level but that's really not a knock against him, when you put out a great album it's all but impossible to duplicate it.  The only reason I don't listen to this album more is the language and lyrical content (it isn't fit, in my opinion, for my 2 year old to hear)  When I do get a chance to listen to it, however, it sounds just as fresh as when it was first released over 10 years ago - give it a listen and pick up a copy.
0321127420|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Martin Fowler's writing style makes reading about patterns as fun as it should be.  He correctly points out that this book is not intended to give experienced developers a lot of new ideas, but rather to give names to patterns we have all been using for a long time.  That's the great benefit of the book, it gives us a vocabulary we can use to talk about these things without spending tons of time explaining what we mean.  I recommend it highly.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|This is one of the latest CDs I've purchased through Amazon.com.  This CD showcases the work of guitarist Jesse Cook (the CD is Live in Montral). <br /> <br />I've been hearing a lot of Jesse Cook on the radio lately and I have to say this CD really showcases his abilities for playing the Flamenco guitar. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD if you enjoy good Flamenco!  I can't wait to purchase additional CDs of Jesse Cook!

It appears at the end of track 5 (Artibeus) and during the 2 minute mark of Laisurus (Track 12) <br /> <br />Hans zimmer and James Newton-Howard have conjured up a wealth of material that capture the true essence of Batman. I enjoyed Elfman's and Goldenthal's but i prefer Batman Begins.  It is a dark yet moving tribuite to Gotham's dark knight. Since its sequel is starting, i only hope that these 2 composers do a sequel.

0786852550|4.0|This would have been a five for me if there was a little more story to it.  I just thought it was a little too simple, but I will definitly read the sequel.  It was really more of a 4.5 then a four to me, but I didn't have much choice.  Nat or John is a cunning young kid who plays with a little too much fire than he can handle.  Sometimes you have no idea what his fate will be, and the book kept me hanging several times.  But by far, Bartimaeus is the best, he has all the good action scenes and is down right hilarious.  The little foot notes are great and he is what made this book.  It is great going back and forth from the two point of views.
0385338082|5.0|i dont like the 'shopaholic' books but i found this one in my beach condo, so i read it.  it is a lot better than i thought it would be!  the writing makes you feel happy for emma when she's in love.  it makes you feel humiliated with emma when her secrets are revealed.  some parts are laugh out loud funny.  you also get to know emma's room mates and her co workers at the office.  i love the way she pours orange juice in her co worker's plant when she gets annoyed with her!  read this book.  it is heart-warming, cute, funny, and in the end, makes you happy.
0671027387|4.0|This was great, Dan Brown kept me on my seat always wanting more.  The story is very interesting...there is science, politics, betrayel, mystery, everything really.  The only downer was I figured out the bad guy way before they were revealed and when they were revealed it wasn't all that spectacular.  Other then that, it was a great read.
B00005JNSK|2.0|Visually, this film is wonderful, and it has many fine moments, right up until the very end.   <br /> <br />In the novel and in the original film, Wonka sees and appreciates Charlie's  good  heart and his love of family.  When Charlie wins, he excitedly invites both Charlie and his  family to live with him, no questions asked.    <br /> <br />The whole point of the original novel and movie is to show Charlie's big heartedness.   <br /> <br />True to form, Burton throws in his own dark,  twisted touch; he gets hung up on the idea of Wonka as a socially maladjusted wierdo.  In Burton's vision, Wonka can't comprehend Charlie's love of family.    <br /> <br />The story isn't supposed to be about Wonka, but about Charlie's big heart.
0709058764|5.0|I've read a lot of instructional books over the years, and this ranks as one of the best.  My greatest concern was that it be worth the price, and it certainly is.  Explanations are clear, photos and diagrams are excellent and the first chapters on historic and contemporary makers make good reading.  The book is ever so slightly thin in the area of plate tuning and violin varnish -- but one might argue that both of these topics are so broad as to justify a separate investment in instructional material.  I am confidant, however, that one can make a very good instrument using this book alone as a guide -- with the exception of plans and patterns for a specific model, which are not included.  The English generally do a very good job at books addressing traditional arts/crafts, and this publication is no exception.  I consider my copy an excellent investment.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by director Alfonso Cuaron.  Perhaps as much as if not more than the inaugural film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. <br /> <br />I did not like the film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (tho I did enjoy the book). Hence, I felt it was wise have Cuaron to direct this installment. <br /> <br />Cuaron is a talented Direcor and he was able to keep keeps the series and this installment fresh, new and ever-changing like life itself.  Futhermore, having the experience of directing \\"coming of age\\" movies shows in the characters. <br /> <br />In this installment the characters have matured. They are now teenagers, willing to take risks.  They know especially Harry, that Life is sometimes dark and accept that even if it means overcoming their fears and facing dementors. <br /> <br />The Books are EXCELLENT but the movies are also good!!!  Don't spoil the books.. read them first then see the movies!!!    <br /> <br />~FallenMoon
1401206905|5.0|If there is one Batman story you have to read, it's Year One. It is better than Dark Knight Returns, although less action-oriented, for one simple reason: it perfectly defines Bruce Wayne/Batman and his relationship with Jim Gordon. Frank Miller is at his finest here, delivering the definitive Batman mythos. With the recent release of Batman Begins, which is heavily inspired by Year One, I strongly encourage you to discover (or rediscover) one of the finest graphic novels ever written.
B00005MP58|5.0|It all started with me zapping around the tv channels and found this series of bbc. I didn't even know the name of it but it struck me immediately. I started following the series but somehow I lost track. luckily I found the name \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austin. I was so curious about what happened at the end, I bought the book. I read english version and then turkish version. I read the book at least 5 times!!!! but I was still craving for the movie... <br /> <br />It was my happies moment when I saw it on DVD. I didn't wait a moment to buy it and forced my friends to watch it with me. I think I own the DVD for 3-4 years now. I don't know how many times I watched it. I memorized some of the scenes... I find myself rewinding it back and forth each time I watch it. It is a classic. I think I will never get bored of this book nor the movie. thanks to BBC, it made me a colin firth fan. To be fair, I also like jenifer ehle:)))) <br /> <br />It is such a good movie, every time I watch it I fall in love with the views, never get bored of the music, deeply touched by the expressions and feel the characters like I am with them. <br /> <br />I love this book, I adore this movie. thanks BBC:)
B000021Y7X|5.0|Excellent sound quality.  The best mix I've ever encountered in a standard DVD product.  All intruments are discernable, proper levels, and no distortion.  If you really like music, this will bump something from you top 10 all time favorites list.
B000088E6D|5.0|I'm a middle aged woman who last swooned over the Beatles. If I was even 20 years younger I'd throw myself at Michael if given the chance.  Saw him in concert and what a treat! Funny and engaging. His music made me swoon and so does this CD every time I listen to it.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I first heard Chloe's track \\"Amazing Grace\\" on radio and knew that I had to find out more about this purest of pure voices. I searched the net and found \\"Celtic Woman\\" on Amazon. The DVD is superbly presented and I can find no fault with it. The arrangements, visual and audio presentations and musicianship are all of what is best in to-days celtic music. Five stars are barely enough. Makes me proud to be Irish! P.S. The girls are all good-lookers, too!
B00005JNTX|5.0|I have in the title from a \\"female\\" point of view because I've noticed that many of the reviews I read about this movie that were aweful was from a woman and that they claim that this was mostly a movie for guys because of the nudity and violence.  Well, I'm here to say that I'm a woman and I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  I thought the acting was awesome, the effects were brilliant, and the story line was great.  I do have to say though, that this is not a movie for people that don't care for excessive violence and nudity.  As for people like me who love gore, violence, and a great creative story line, this is right up your alley.  Please keep a very open mind for this movie if you had no idea what the comic book was about.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This movie is my favorite non-western John Wayne. Unlike most of <br />what you see today it was shoot on location and uses real animals, instead of the computer generated variety. The story is <br />very believable and the action is top notch. I've seen this DVD <br />many times and never get tired of watching it. For me It's one of those shows you pull out and watch at least once a year. I've read many books on Africa and this movie does a good job <br />of taking you there. If you study this movie there are several <br />interesting irregularities through out that do not detract from <br />the show but would make for fascinating interviews with the few <br />remaining cast and crew. Any time you put big name actors together with so many wild animals there has to be some very <br />interesting stories behind all of that. Hatari is a perfect <br />candidate for a multi disc special edition set, with the making <br />of the movie as well as interviews and bonus material. If you've been interested in Africa or African Animals, after watching Hatari you too may wonder where at in Africa was that <br />Compound that John Wayne and his crew worked out of and is it  <br />still there today?
1400034205|5.0|The Razors Edge dares to be something that few, well-written, purely crafted and perfectly realized modern novels have the courage to do: be largely lacking in cynicism.  Maugham seems to think that human beings are perfectly capable of achieving what most sources, apart from the most puerile, feel is impossible: perfect happiness.  Maugham does this despite the fact that he is unflinching in portraying all the characters in the full light of authorial inspection.  No one, not even Larry, the hero of the tale, is shown in anything but a fully rounded and realized gaze.  What we get is a sharpness that is dazzling without being blinding, and a hopefulness that never comes close to bordering on the sentimental or maudlin.

B00003CXC7|4.0|In this Alfred Hitchcock film, Jimmy Stewart plays a professional photographer confined to his apartment because of a broken leg. From his rear window, he is able to look out in the courtyard of the apartments around him and into the windows of other apartments. He becomes voyeur looking into to the lives of other people because he cannot get out on his own and he is bored with it. During the course of his vicarious living, he becomes suspicious about a neighbor and comes to believe that he is a murderer but nobody at first will believe him. Gradually, others come around but danger looms when the crook realizes that he is being watched. <br /> <br />This has become something of a signature role for Jimmy Stewart. He gives a very creditable performance with only a single flaw. He is bored with life and bored with his adoring, socialite, beautiful and intelligent girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly. He displays ebullient, angry, pensive, playful and sarcastic moods well but he never quite manages to be convincing when he is bored with Grace Kelly. No one is that good an actor! <br /> <br />The suspense in this film comes from wondering what is going to happen next and from the dramatic photography. There is no blood and gore. Kind of makes you miss the \\"good old days.\\" <br />
B000002UDB|5.0|Poor Paul McCartney just never learned his lesson about staying away from film-making. This project was his idea as was Let It Be as was Give My Regards To Broad Street. At first it's cool to see the Fabs running around in various psychedelic scenarios but the whole thing quickly wears thin because a plot is a necessity to a film like diapers to a baby....wow, that's a BAD analogy!Anyway, the soundtrack saves this project from dismal failure because if there's one thing the Beatles knew it was how to put a good album together. The title song is a nice rockin' romp, followed by Pauls' moody Fool On the Hill(another hidden reference to the Mahirishi)Flying is an instrumental credited to all four Beatles and McCartneys'Your Mother Should Know is an almost rag-time kind of sing-along with perky backgrounds from Lennon & Harrison. Georges dark and mysterious Blue Jay Way makes you almost see \\"the fog upon LA\\" and Lennons' masterpiece I Am the Walrus reminds us once again that the man was a creative genius. The second half of the album are songs not written for the film;in fact, Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane were originally slated for Sgt Pepper but the Beatles released them as singles a year earlier before the Pepper album was completed so they didn't make the final cut. But having two Lennon classics on the same album (Fields&Walrus)is enough to make the album well worth it.You also get the anthemic All You Need is Love and the psychedelic Baby You're a Rich Man. Not quite a true studio album like Rubber Soul or Sgt Pepper but the songs are good and won't disappoint....can't say the same for the film
B000002OX7|5.0|WHO's NEXT is a one of a kind album...a MASTERPIECE.  THE songwriting and musicianship is PHENOMENAL...every song has emotion and power behind it...I am so glad that the young people of the world are even learning about some of THE WHO's music through car commercials, TV shows (CSI), and the recent LIVE 8 Concerts....Who's Next is an excellent album and a great way to enjoy classic rock n'roll music....after you listen to WHO's NEXT...check out Quadrophenia, TOMMY, WHO ARE YOU, It's Hard, and the rest of their collections.....LONG LIVE ROCK N'ROLL!!! <br />THis album/cd is one I enjoy listening to straight through from start to finish....OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER and....
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I am going to buy this DVD sight unseen because I trust that Eric, Jack and Ginger gave some spirited performances at the Royal Albert Hall in May.Just to hear them play tunes like Born Under A Bad Sign, Badge, Crossroads and White Room will be worth the cost of the DVD. This is a reunion that I honestly never thought I'd see. Obviously Clapton has resisted it for all these years but something or someone gave him a change of heart and I'm glad about that
0920668372|5.0|As a mother I have read this story to all my children and I actually say the poem every night to my kids while they sleep.  It is the best account of the love a mother feels for her children than I have ever seen before. <br /> <br />Wonderful pictures and really easy to follow for young ones too.  WONDERFUL!!!!
B00006AW2O|5.0|If you want to explore the Stones in their musical youth, then this album is a good place to start.This was their second album, predating the song Satisfaction which catapulted them into the stratosphere and moved them in an even more commercial direction than they were already going. The Stones blues roots are still very evident here on songs like Confessin' the Blues and Good Times, Bad Times. They also do a fantastic cover of Chuck Berrys' Around and Around, which opens the album.2120 S Michigan Ave is a spirited r&b instrumental written as an ode to Chess Records still located in Chicago in those days. Mick Jagger and Brian Jones show off their excellent harp playing on this tune and many others on the album. The Stones also cover The Drifters Under the Boardwalk and did an okay version but it doesn't surpass the original.Keith Richards employs an acoustic 12 string to Congratulations, a Jagger/Richard original and one of their earliest written songs together.The albums' big hit is Time Is On My Side but the song that really stands out is It's All Over Now. This song would've been a great addition to the live album the Stones released several years later Get Yer Ya Ya's Out. So if you're looking for a true representation of the fledgling Rolling Stones then buy this album
B0002IQAMW|4.0|The Allman Brothers Band's \\"Eat A Peach\\" was a much anticipated album when it was released in February 1972, coming on the heels of their commercial breakthrough \\"At Fillmore East\\" (1971) and the November 1971 death of guitarist Duane Allman. In LP format, which came lavishly packaged and, at least in its first pressings, beautifully mastered, the four sides of this double album made a great deal of structural sense. Side one offered the 'new' ABB, in the form of three new gems recorded shortly after Duane's death. Gregg's originals, though not nececessarily written after his brother's tragic motorcycle accident, nevertheless convey the essence of the blues as deeply as Bobby Bland a decade earlier, and 'Ain't Wasting Time No More' and 'Melissa' both evoke a haunting, mournful tone thanks to some of Greg's most deeply felt vocals; Dicky Betts' nine-minute instrumental \\"Les Breres\\" smolders and catches fire much like the classic 'Elizabeth Reed' from \\"Idlewild South\\", demonstrating the new lineup retained its telepathy and vitality. Greg's classic songs and Betts' dazzling, extended intsrumental workout were proof positive that for the time at least, the ABB's inventiveness and cohesion remained intact. The second side offered the first 19 minutes of their unhurried, relaxed improvisation, inspired by Donovan's classic 'There Is A Mountain', here titled 'Mountain Jam' and taken from Fillmore shows recorded shortly after the previous year's live album. Side three blazed to yet another peak, with terrific and fascinating new material recorded before Duane's death, fleshed out by two splendid blues workouts also recorded at those Fillmore shows. Of the studio tracks, 'Stand Back' is a soulful rocker reminiscent of Delaney & Bonnie, and 'Blue Sky' is the first (and to these ears best) example of Betts' relaxed, country-inspired lyricism. The side closed with a lovely coda to the first era of the ABB, an acoustic duet between  Duane and Dicky called 'Little Martha'. Finally, side four finishes off with the last 15 minutes of 'Mountain Jam'. Every CD edition of \\"Eat A Peach\\" eschews the original format, choosing instead to include all 34 minutes of 'Mountain Jam' in one uninterrupted helping. As for this new SACD, it is sonically  by far the most impressive version of this album, which capture the Allmans at their peak, sonically. The sound is warm, detailed, and full. You feel the heat and sparks of a breathing entity when all band members shared a focus and goal and were listening and responding to one another. And Gregg's vocals have never sounded so full of soul. Of the three-dozen SACDs I own, only several Rolling Stones titles (issued by ABKCO in 2002, identifiable by the digipaks that house them) and Ronnie Lane/Pete Townshend's deeply moving \\"Rough Mix\\" (Hip-o) are nearly as revelatory. Nevertheless I also recommend seeking out a mint copy of the original double album, with the warm tubey sound and fabulous cover art, for though it may be a minority opinion, I find it structurally preferable: 'Mountain Jam' is not the sort of dynamic buildup 'Whipping Post' (from the Fillmore set) is; the pace is far more relaxed, and therefore having it broken up on sides two and four actually makes for a more interesting listening experience. The 34 minute CD version is simply a bit too meandering. Thus I do wish the lp format was used for at least one CD issue. Otherwise EAP is the ABB still at a peak, growing and evolving before the rot began to set in, first evident on the blockbuster 1973 followup \\"Brothers & Sisters\\" (a respectable work that nevertheless finds Greg fading into the background and the presence of Betts as the band's dominant songwriter - he was, or had become, simply too bland to carry the weight). B&S was a masterpiece, however, compared to the forced and unconvincing \\"Win, Lose Or Draw\\", after which the band broke up until their fine 1979 comeback \\"Enlightened Rogues\\". But on their fourth album, \\"Eat A Peach\\", Dicky Betts' songwriting voice - a relaxed, countryish contrast to Gregg's blues and soul intensity -  is just hitting its stride, and the varied moods and textures, spread over a large canvas, make this one of the major albums of '72.
0780631684|3.0|People don't watch films like this for the plot or acting.  Good thing.  The plot is tired and the characters only exist to become death fodder.<br /><br />People watch films like this because they think its cool watching new, novel ways to mutilate two-dimensional characters.  If that is what the viewer wants, that is what the viewer gets.  From the first scenes to the last, characters are cut, slashed, burned, squashed, and otherwise wiped out.  The director does a better than average job of filming the gore.  Even though I don't like this type of film, I have to admit I was impressed with the creativity.  I didn't know there were so many ways to film accidents.  I never suspected that an exploding barbecue grill could do so much damage.  In this particular cut and slash film the director gets to kill off the characters more than once.  Now that's a lot of bang for the buck!<br /><br />I have only two suggestions.  If you are watching the film with a group of friends, get some sodas and pop corn.  If you are watching the film alone, don't waste your time going through it in the usual, slow way.  It is quit easy to predict when the cool stuff is about to happen.  Keep a finger on the remote control and zoom through the film, only slowing down for the really neat stuff.  Then you can back up to slow motion and watch it all again.  This way you can see every body get killed four times and get it done in about an hour!
B000002NIW|5.0|I will tell you all right now, I AM A DEFTONES FREAK!!!!! <br />I know pretty much anything about the Deftones you could imagine, but that is all besides the point. I am here to review this excellent Deftones album, \\"Around the Fur\\"! This is NOT the band's best-selling effort, nor is it the best Deftones album, but it is usual for most bands to not do as well with your second official release, but many don't know why. After an album is released, producers make bands tour all across the nation and almost immediately force them back into the recording studio to write another album to sell! Sorry, I got distracted. Let's go back, this album is worth 5 stars, but is isn't as good- or original- as \\"Adrenaline\\", which is my all-time favorite cd that I would give 6 stars if I could! Let's get to the part where I review each track: <br />1. \\"My own summer(shove it)\\"- 5/5 By far the best heavy track on the album, which is probably why it was the first single from the album. I love the creepy bass-line Chi Cheng provides underneath Abe Cunningham's cymbal-driven drum beats. <br />2.\\"Lhabia\\"- 4/5 Do we have to say it, you all know what that is, don't you? This is a pretty heavy song, but it also is very melodic, something that the Deftones didn't have a whole lot of in \\"Adrenaline\\". <br />3.\\"Mascara\\"-5/5 This is a real first for the Deftones, song-writing-wise, because it is so mellow, but it is traditional 'Tones because of the \\"twisted love\\" lyrics. This is actually Chino Moreno's(the singer) favorite song! <br />4.\\"Around the Fur\\"-5/5 The title track is usually the foundation of an album and this one comes through with flying colors! It is very aggressive and though I've never truly enjoyed the \\"rap-metal\\" side of the Deftones, but the breakdown is a pretty good section! <br />5.\\"Rickets\\"-3/5 This song is pretty heavy but it's just filler for the most part, and \\"filler\\" means boring and written quickly to extend the track listing. <br />6.\\"Be quiet and Drive(far away)\\"-5/5This is the band's first \\"power ballod\\"-type song, but is alt. metal so it doesn't have a cliched \\"guitar-solo\\". This was the second-and last- single from this album, but it definitely got some good attention for the band. Stephen Carpenter really takes it up a notch on the guitar work! <br />7.\\"lotion\\"-5/5 This is a really heavy song that will remind many fans of \\"Adrenaline\\" of the song \\"Lifter\\". <br />8.\\"Dai the Flu\\"-10/5 This is the song that should be played on the radio 24'7, Chi Cheng's overdriven bass guitar makes the song perfect, though I love Stef Carpenter for his guitar work, this cd was driven far too much by guitar alone! \\"Adrenaline\\" showcases Chi's work and you should pick that up, too! This is one of my favorite songs of all time! <br />9.\\"Headup\\"-2/5 Max Cavalera makes his jump from Sepultura to a guest track on \\"ATF\\" with \\"headup\\". He may be better than Stephen Carpenter at shredding, but his riffs/lyrics are wasted with Deftones. This song was just a little too \\"Nu-Metal\\" for them, and Deftones are quite unhappy with that word for any band, because it is so negative. The lyrics for this song influenced Max to make his own band called Soulfly. <br />10.\\"MX\\"-5/5 This song is creepy.Period. Abe's wife, Annalynn is a guest vocalist. She is Ok, I guess, but at least she has a cool lyical conversation with Chino. <br />Hidden track. \\"Damone\\"- 5/5 The next-best song on \\"ATF\\". Just to let you know, you shouldn't wait for this song to come up a couple seconds after MX is over, you have to wait 30 minutes! So I usually hit fast forward on my cd player until I hear Chino saying something while he is high, then it just a little more forwarding then the song plays. <br />Well, it has been fun reviewing this Album and i hope you buy it or make a copy of it from your friend, and if you really enjoyed this album, you should also get \\"Adrenaline\\".
B0000CAXIC|4.0|This album released in 1997 'The Colour And The Shape' spearheaded the rock group into the worldwide rock stage and brought them many new fans in turn. This is rock music with a splash of grunge mixed in. With the album under the stewardship of Gil Norton (who has been in the rock genre industry for a long time) the Foo Fighters have put out a solid album fit for all ages. This is unlike other Foo Fighter's releases and the listener will notice the definite differance within the second song 'Monkey Wrench' and 'Hey, Johnny Park'. This was near the beginning of their career as a band and were just starting out with their signature sound.<br /><br />Other songs that I liked were 'My Hero', 'See You' and 'Everlong'. Rock music never sounded any better - with the new invigorated sound of Foo Fighters.
0783225857|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  No matter how many times I've seen it before, I will watch it again.<br /><br />Having been raised in the deep South, this movie eloquently captures a time during the Depression when people were poor, hungry, scared, and ignorant.  The character of Atticus Finch quietly parsed the poverty and ignorance of his town with educated intelligence and the soul of a good man ... as his children watched in amazement.<br /><br />The casting, acting, photography, and musical score bring Harper Lee's original story to life.  The black and white film is perfectly fitting.  Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus was his very best work.  I still watch him in awe.<br /><br />My grandmother watched this movie with me when I was a little girl.  I recommend that all grandparents watch To Kill A Mockingbird with their grandchildren and continue a beautiful tradition.
B00005R87K|5.0|1) The Movie: It's Nosferatu.  It's great. 'Nuff Said. <br /> <br />2) This particular version has no extras and the chapter list seems not to start at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br />3) The print, for the most part, is quite clear. <br /> <br />4) The score is intersting to say the least (kind of Jazzy in a way). <br /> <br />5) I was able to pick it up for under $7 <br /> <br />All-in-all, for the money it can't be beat.
0792844890|5.0|This movie is a favorite for pretty much everyone.  For Sci-Fi fans, it takes a poke at all classic sci-fi movies with the Mel Brooks twist.  While some of the language is not appropriate for little ones, teens and adults alike will love the humor and visuals; some subtle - some outright.
0786715103|5.0|This is a very important and brilliant book, that has to be read by all who are interested in politics, particularly foreign policy. It's hard to get a grip on what has been done to people in Rwanda and how the international community could be as indifferent as it was.

B0008G2IRO|5.0|This is a real awesome Hip-Hop CD, It defines Hip-Hop that uses melodies, and instruments, without using violent tones or screaming. I love the characters (2-D and Noodle being my Favorite) My favorite songs being \\"El Maana\\" and Feel Good Inc. The DVD is really worth buying considering the music video is made very well. All in all, I love it, worth the money.  <br /> <br />            To add interest, I suggest when you buy this, buy the album \\"Voyageur\\" by Enigma (Enigma is New Age). The Genre maybe different but the Music style is similar enough, (as there is a bit of Hip-Hip in Voyageur as well) Here are the track similarities I found interesting <br />         Enigma:                Gorillaz <br />         Incognito              Dirty Harry <br />         Voyageur               Feel Good Inc. <br />         ITS,ITL                El Maana <br />         Look Of Today          Dare <br />         Boum-Boum              EPWRID <br /> <br />As I said, don't expect the songs of both artists to be the same or similar in Contrast, because they're different genres but the songs are similar because of the music and vocal style. Try it out, you might like it. The CD is great nonetheless, considering I'm not that crazy about Hip-Hop in General.   <br />
B00004TWZF|5.0|This is the most beautiful movie ever, with the really good music. It is a movie that you just have to see.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Sorry for stealing your title Eggplant (you have good music taste), but I had to get a point across. YES! Its finally over! Britneys 15 minutes of fameare up, and I couldn't be happier. Back in '99, I remember hearing \\"Hit me baby one more time\\" and I felt like jumping out of a window, not because of the song, but because it was getting ultra-heavy rotation on MTV (although the song WAS terrible). It just proved to me that the apocolypse was near. Why MTV would play this nonstop is beyond me, and I hope they realize that they CAN change music to what it was in the past. MTV thinks that this is what kids want so they keep feeding it to them, but in reality kids think its cool becuase its on MTV, if MTV played, oh, lets say some old live Led Zeppelin tapes then kids would think it was cool and listen.  <br />   But at least some people are realizing that this dumb f**k is a fake and are revolting against her. This will soon happen to the rest of the pop divas (Christina, Jessica) and the pop-rap fad (you know what it is). Britney just kept getting worse and worse, and was never good to begin with, I really dont understand how people could listen to this without having their ears bleed. And My Prerogative was bad enough to start, but then Britney had to go and make it unbearable, what is this? The next Kidz Bop? Go away Britney, I hope you DIE! <br />  Oh yeah, and to the fans that dont agree with me: Go ahead and click not helpful, see if I care. And if you write a review saying that I suck because I hate Britney then that just proves your ignorance and says you have no idea of \\"freedom of speech\\".
0385504209|5.0|'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown quite simply is one of the greatest books I have ever read.  There is a very good reason why this book has sold millions upon millions of copies, and remains near the top of every bestseller list years after its release.<br /><br />Repeat, there is a reason why.<br /><br />In his novel, Dan Brown begins with a murder inside the Louvre and then goes from there to spin a tale the likes of which few authors have ever been able to create.  The work that Brown does here is an opus, it's the kind of life's work that few authors hope to come close to reaching.<br /><br />I find it fascinating looking at all the reviews that have been posted, as there seems to be no middle ground when it comes to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  Either one loves it or hates it, and for the most part, people LOVE this book.  Like the movie Million Dollar Baby with it's controversial turn, this book looks Christians squarely in the face and when they look back in return many don't like what they are staring at.  I am not saying that what Dan Brown writes is based on facts (he'll be the first to remind you that it is a fictional work), but one thing this novel will get you to do is think.<br /><br />I don't believe in giving away the spoiler moments of books, especially ones that I love as much as this one, and I won't break that habit in this review.  I have written lots of reviews on amazon, but there are few things that I can recommend higher than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  Many individuals don't like \\"following the trend\\" and reading/watching/listening just because the majority is doing the same exact thing, but this work is extraordinary and if you don't take the ride of reading this art, you will be doing yourself a great disservice.<br /><br />One of the greatest pieces of literature I have ever read.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B00015YVDG|4.0|RANSOM is yet another Hollywood extravaganza movie about the terrors of the crime of kidnapping - with a twist.  Ron Howard directs this, for the most part, gripping story with propulsion and the ability to gain nuanced performances from a disparate cast.  The result is a tightly wound spring that coils tensely until the last fifteen minutes when the film explodes.<br /><br />Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) is a wealthy man with a strong willed wife Kate (Rene Russo) and a son Sean (Brawley Nolte - yes, in life the son of actor Nick Nolte).  When Sean is kidnapped by a Detective (!)  Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) and ransom is demanded, Tom goes before national TV audiences and doubles the ransom demand  for a bounty on Shaker's life.  How this turn of events of a kidnapper becoming the victim and the resolution of the kidnapping that results is the gist of the story: it is the struggle of good vs evil, citizen vs police, and calling the bluff of a dangerous man for the sake of a father saving his child.<br /><br />Gibson does well as the torn father, though director Howard allows him to go a bit over the edge, acting wise.  The real shiner of this film is Gary Sinise who continues to impress with the facility with which he moves through varied character parts.  There are moments of fine expressive silences from co-stars Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler, Delroy Lindo, and Donnie Wahlberg that enhance the tension because of the underplaying of their roles: Gibson could take some pointers...A good cat and mouse tale that has at its core the heinous crime of kidnapping, police corruption, and family devotion, this film is worth a view.  Grady Harp, July 05
0312323859|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book. A great follow-up to Something Borrowed.I look forward to new titles by this author.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, the graphics are great and the main song that is sung is wonderful!!! I reccomend this to anyone whether they have kids or not.
0316172324|3.0|Blink is a compilation of the work of certain researchers that is cobbled together to create a \\"book\\". There are different names than people I have studied, different research than I've previously read, but the subject matter, results and observations of the researchers is similar enough to not add a thing. In the end, the book is a fast read because it is slick and glossy, cotton candy for the mind.
B00005JMEW|2.0|So, you're right. Is it art? I guess it must be. A lot of people think it's brilliant. Simply brilliant. Regrettably, I must be a moron because it seems to me like a lot of garbage.<br /><br />Two things cross my mind. Actually three. First, it's a chunky Alec Baldwin (come on man, YOU ARE brilliant. Red October; The Getaway(s). Lose the role, get the role) in Pearl Harbor saying to Ben Afleck regarding some story he told  . . . \\"It's b*******, but it's extremely good b*******.\\" That's my first thought about Kill Bill.<br /><br />My second thought is that if you sculpted the Mona Lisa in Guda Cheese, some one somewhere (I gotta tell you I think it would be LA) will tell you 'it's fantastic. Fantabulous. Brilliant. Splendid. Really.' It's bad enough going to weddings in Ann Arbor where the poor parents have spent $15,000 on an ice sculpture of the Infant of Prague. But at least no one is saying it's art.<br /><br />The third thought I had is a comment made on TV about Janet Jackson and the ill fated wardrobe malfunction. And this person was saying that it was only a (insert gender specific body part here) and at least it wasn't decapitation and amputation.<br /><br />Wow. Obviously that person hadn't seen Kill Bill. Could there be a movie that would trivialize the first 25 minutes of Private Ryan? If there is one, it's Kill Bill. This movie gave new meaning to the 1940 'angry boss' movies when they would quip, 'heads will roll!'<br /><br />So, I apologize. There must be art here because it gets such rave reviews. Come on. It's junk. Makes Stallone sound like Olivier. 2 stars in lower case because Uma worked her (another body part) off and looked good doing it. Larry Scantlebury
B00008H2LB|4.0|Ok, long story short, I used to be addicted to Linkin Park, Deftones, Trapt, Taproot, ect. <br />Then, I found Post Hxc and Indie. I fell in love. All my old CDs are nowhere to be found. <br />Trapt is replaced by Kaddisfly, KoRn is replaced by Norma Jean, ect. <br />I still listen to Linkin Park. Even though Linkin Park isn't even 'Cool/Underground' to you all anymore, they have that 'esque' many other bands [ahem, Limp Bizkit] seem to lose once they make it in the music business.  <br />I can still say Linkin Park is original. <br />Let's just hope they don't stop making music.
B00000J7SS|2.0|After listening to this the first time, I thought Miles had gone mad. A few more listens later I still think that Miles was mad  when he made this record. The first CD is pure noise. The second CD though is somewhat better. I especially like the short track \\"Mclaughlin\\". On the whole, `Bitches Brew' is definitely overrated. <br />I would prefer the pre-fusion works of Miles. Anyday. <br /> <br />Sanjiv
B000002552|5.0|I've enjoyed the Basement Tapes.  I love the Band and have missed their music.  I saw Bob Dylan in concert a few weeks ago, and I hear hints of his current sound in these cuts.  What's not to love!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Three years back on an evening where I felt that life was happening somewhere else on our earth, I decided to hear some new music. I seldom use my stereo system for music thanks to my mp3 player but on this one day for some reason I popped in some of Norah Jones(Come Away With Me) to basically analyse what the fuss was all about. When \\"Dont Know Why\\" started I thought to myself this is easily the best song on the album which is probably why it is Track 1.I was both right and wrong.I was wrong because within the simplicity of the sound lies a strong interconnection to my mind of some sort.It remains my favourite song by Norah Jones so I was right.<br /><br />I would think this album is what is meant for loners like me. I often feel I am not lonely but I'm just alone. Seven Years makes me feel a silent jolt of the most refreshing liquid emotion. Three tracks later, I recheked to see the date of release of the album because it was quite hard to believe that music like this was made in 2002 (not so distant past)<br /><br />There are many people who say that most or all of Norah Jones music is monotonous. I would agree with them simply because of the absolute lucid simplicity that every song brings out in itself. I'm sure after years of contemplating a relationship I would hear this music for once not in solitude and smile a tear or two to myself.Of course, I fell in love with Norah Jones after hearing Come Away With Me. I don't know why music that makes you fall asleep is looked upon with a frown. I understand it's sleep inducing music that actually makes me feel calm and collected.<br /><br />On Come Away With Me, there are pauses in sound structure and you will find yourself waiting for things to happen. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone simply because music like this deserves no stamp of approval by a novice like me.<br /><br />Please see, Unlike the Amazon guys, I don't think \\"Nearness Of You\\" is all that enchanting a track.My favourite tracks on this cd would be - \\"Dont Know Why\\" , \\"Seven Years\\" , \\"Painter's Song\\" and the title track. \\"More Than This\\" is beautiful too.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />P.S (again) Check out Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" to hear God singould be - \\"Dont Know Why\\" , \\"Seven Years\\" , \\"Painter's Song\\" and the title track. \\"More Than This\\" is beautiful too. <br /> <br />Enjoy <br /> <br />P.S (again) Check out Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" to hear God sing
0307120007|5.0|I have 2 daughters - one age 23 who just gave birth to a baby girl, Emma Jill, last week; and another daughter, age 18, who is living in Heaven following a car accident on August 2, 2002. 23 years ago, I purchased \\"Pat the Bunny (Touch and Feel Book)\\" for my first daughter, Jennifer.  Around the time she was 6-10 months old, she already knew what \\"Pat the Bunny\\" was.  Every single day, she insisted that we share \\"Pat the Bunny\\" together!  She loved the book and it calmed her in a way that no other books or toys did.  When my second daughter, Jill, came along, she was the same way; however, she had even stronger feelings about \\"Pat the Bunny.\\"  She even slept with it!  I believe \\"Pat the Bunny\\" is an EXCELLENT book for children beginning at about 6 months old.  Today, my little grandaughter will receive her first package in the mail - \\"Pat the Bunny!\\" I hope she receives the same enjoyment as her mother and aunt did and I am very sure she will!  Thank you to Dorothy Kunhardt for creating a book that is so touching for all children.  Sincerely, Peggy Rozell
0141301155|4.0|This book is AWESOME!!! But one thing: the Oompa Loompas were a bit scary and cruel at times. Like every time a child was harmed they danced and sang like they were glad that the child was gone. And the song they sang about TVs and books was a bit much. Children don't need to learn that TVs are evil and books are better. We need Tvs for news and things you know.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is the best album that I've come across as far as I can remember. If I wasn't already a raving mad Coldplay fan, this album would have made me one. From the euphoric Franz-Ferdinand-meets-Travis frenzy of \\"White Shadows\\" to the acoustic sweetness of the hidden bonus track \\"Kingdom Come\\" recalling John Denver's \\"Annie's Song\\", every track on the album takes you through on a journey through soundscapes filled with rich musical details. From the deliberate fragility of Aqualung to the laid-back drifting of Rialto, the third album pushes the boundaries of the Coldplay sound to encompass a wide variety of influences, presenting a repertoire that is part rock, part ambience, and all Coldplay. It is gorgeous, it is marvellous, it is terrifying. Humanity in general needs more albums like X&Y--there would be less suffering, and more joy.
B000002H33|4.0|Let me just say that if Kirk Hammett actually tried and put effort into this album then it would get a 5. Because Cliff, James, and Lars' all worked hard made history here (especially Cliff). But Kirk is possibly the most overrated guitarist of all time, and it should be very clear he didn't try when he made the title track solo. Sorry for the rest of the band, they were truly amazing here, maybe if Mustaine was still here then I would probably say this is as good as everyone says it is. I am a true Metallica fan and this I have to say is the WORST of their first five albums. The black album even beat this! But at least in the black album Kirk actually made GOOD solos!  <br />   Right, with Kirk out of the way I can focus on the qualities of Metallica: Cliff Burton is one of the greatest bassists ever, and in 'Orion', while not as good as 'Anesthesia...' from Kill, still had one of the most creative bass performances ever. James' vocals were decent, his rhythem guitar good, and his lyrics PHENOMENAL! Keeping in mind he was about 23 when he recorded this then he definitely did a good job. Lars' drumming has never been better. In Kill his drumming was that of your average metal drummer, in Ride it vastly improved, and in Master it kept improving, making Lars the best damn metal drummer ever!  <br />   While it may be true that James, Lars, and Cliff worked their asses off on this album, Kirk basically didn't work at all. I'd also like to point out that Sanitarium only uses seven notes in its verses and intro! Same seven notes just picked more than once. To any fan who thinks I am anti Metallica or something, no. I like this, just dont love it. The same goes for 'Ride' and Black Album. I LOVE 'Kill' and 'Justice', those have the best guitar work (Kirk worked hard in 'Justice', so get that for great guitar work). I guess I'll list my favorite tracks in order: <br />1. Orion <br />2. Battery <br />3. Leper Messiah (creative riff, crappy solo) <br />4. Master of Puppets <br />5. Disposeable Heroes <br />6. The Thing That Should Not Be <br />7. Sanitarium <br />8. Damage Inc. (oddly enough, this has the best solo from the album) <br /> <br />I dont expect a whole lot of helpful votes.
B000077VR3|4.0|This is a movie that definately will not be for everyone. The songs are what pulled me in and make me keep going back. Of course Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were fantastic(and they can sing!!!), but there was also the Unconscious Argentinean (Jacek Koman) who was wonderful. Anyone who has a taste for the unusual should try this out. I will admit that there was one point when I felt uncomfortably overwhelmed with color, sound, and flashing images. If you decide to give it a try, DO NOT go into it as a serious film. The first time I saw it, there were several \\"what was THAT\\" for me in the movie. I consider this movie a keeper, but it has a different flavor from the normal.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|YOU SUCK! If you knew anything about metal you'd realize that Dave Mustaine (not Hetfield, idiot) is one of the best metal guitarists ever if not THE best (he's next to Tony Iommi) and that Wes Borland sucks! Fred Durst is just some 40 year old going through her, I mean his midlife crisis and he wants to feel young again by \\"rapping\\" about how he f**ked Britney Spears and how he wears his hat backwards. Anyone who likes Limp Bizkit is retarded, seriously. Megadeth kicks ass and if Mustaine, Ellefson, or the rest of the band saw what you wrote than a shotgun would be the last thing you saw. Right, I'm done.<br /><br />  Anyway, I really like this album. Its one of my favorite CD's that I've ever purchased. Holy Wars has some of the best songwriting I've ever heard, and some of the best solos too. Same goes for Hangar 18, except instead of 3 or 4 great solos you have ELEVEN! Five Magics has an amazing bass intro by Ellefson and the guitars are pretty damn sweet too, lyrics also good. Dawn Patrol is a bit different, with just bass and bass drums (aside from vocals). Rust In Peace...Polaris has a great verse riff and great songwriting from Mustaine, drum intro is also pretty cool. Those are the standout songs, the others are good, just not as good. If you love Megadeth, metal, rock, or just music, then get this.<br /><br />  **NOTE** - When I say \\"music\\" I mean rock, and anything with instruments AND vocals. I dont mean pop, post '96 rap, emo (it has vocals and instruments, but it sucks), and pop-R&B.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|ok, i edited my review...if anyone remembers, i obviosuly didn't like this remix/remaster...but now, after about a year of hearing songs from it off and on, i am starting to like it now. I still love the original production though, and i am a big enough fan to listen to both, lol. I bought this a year ago when it first came out, and i was like wtf??? I didn't like it at all, but after a year of listening to it off and on, i am actually starting to like it now. BUT, Coundown, Youth, and Cryptic are still the only remix.remasters i like. Sorry dave, i like the old peace sells, so far so good so what, and rust in peace productions better...but you sold me on Countdown, Youth, and Cryptic! I own and listen to both the originals and remixed,remastered versions now.<br /><br />On to the album itself, Yes, Megadeth took a little chance with this one, but it still sounds like trademark Megadeth. In fact, the only Megadeth cd i think that didn't sound like them was risk. Skin 'O My Teeth is still one of my all time favorite Megadeth songs. That opening drum roll still amazes me to this day! Symphoney of Destruction has become a \\"deth\\" classick. Architecture and Foreclosure are both awesome songs,i love the choruses in both. Sweating bullets is another deth classick, and this way my life was always under-appreciated in my opinion. The title track is actually very impressive, the music and the bands ability to pull it off live is great. Psychtron and Captive honour are some of my favorites too. The whole album rules!!! I can now appreciate this remix/remaster!
0800177177|2.0|Gary Oldman as Dracula makes as much sense as Bela Lugosi as Lenny Bruce.  The redeeming bit of this film fiasco is Anthony Hopkins as a bizarre and interesting Van Helsing.  This isn't Bram Stoker, it's Francis Ford Copulating with the script, and patting himself on the back in the process. (The cinematograph scene is useless). You'll see some scene sendups of The Exorcist, Dracula as Phyllis Diller (at least that's what his makeup looked like to me with that stupid hairdo in the castle), and Winny Ryder when she's not busy boosting in a store or something else to get herself busted.  Reeves as Jonathan Harker??? You must be kidding.  The only thing worse than his Brit accent in this one was his Southern accent in Devil's Advocate. Skip this one fans of the undead--it's staked out.
B00005UOKM|5.0|Blue Note is often credited with a 'different approach' to 60's avant garde jazz.  The difference, I would say, is due to a more studied, cerebral quality among the Blue Note issues. <br /> <br />Hutcherson himself credits the expansive mood prevalent in New York City at the time--a willingness to 'cross-pollinate' art forms typified by the outdoor 'happenings' that were part of the scene.   <br /> <br />This record, \\"Dialogue\\", has the feel of synchronicity:  six players on the same wavelength.  The core of the record is formed by the two tracks, \\"Les Nois Marchant\\" and \\"Dialogue\\" which dovetail into each other seamlessly, with the feel of exploratory 20th Century chamber music.  The ragtag processional, \\"Marchant\\" has a bit lighter mood than \\"Dialogue\\", which revolves around a repeated, stalking bass line. <br /> <br />The rest of the record, frankly, seems haunted by the ghost of Eric Dolphy.  One wonders if he would have participated in the sessions, had he not met an untimely death.  \\"Idle While\\" sounds very like \\"Ode to Charlie Parker\\" from Dolphy's \\"Far Cry\\", although Hutcherson's floating vibes provide a supranormal glow to the piece.  Sam Rivers provides Dolphyesque bass clarinet to the slightly off kilter blues, \\"Ghetto Lights\\", as well as a great, laid back soprano sax solo. <br /> <br />Much of the music here anticipates directions that music would take in the next decade, predating the Art Ensemble of Chicago's forays into 'little instruments', and British progressive rockers like King Crimson openly acknowledge that they were listening to the Blue Note releases.  They would certainly have heard this one, because King Crimson improvs were very similar in feel to this. <br /> <br />The musicians on \\"Dialogue\\" are uniformly great.  Freddie Hubbard and Richard Davis contribute some of their finest playing on record.  This is a mentally stimulating record that will get those endorphins going--with no sweat involved.  <br /> <br />Don't pass it by.
B00097A5HW|4.0|After being a little hesistant about buying this cd (a lot of people lot negative reviews about it), I'm glad I did.  It doesn't sound like any of her previous works, but it still mesmerizes.  I love almost all of the songs.  The ones she did with Gustavo Cerrati are great tunes.  I especially love \\"Las de la Intuicin\\", \\"Lo imprescindible\\", \\"No\\", \\"La Pared\\", \\"Dia Especial\\" and \\"En tus pupilas\\".  If I don't give it a five star, is because she could have included more songs (not two remixes, although they're good) and the song \\"Obtener un Si\\" doesn't quite do it for me.  If you like Shakira, I recommend to buy this cd.  If you're waiting for another \\"Pies Descalzos\\", \\"Donde estn los ladrones?\\" or, specially, \\"Laundry Service\\", you will be dissapointed.
B00079018K|5.0|Enough about Franz Ferdinand, the Hives, the Strokes, blah blah blah.  Sure, all these bands are entertaining, but do they really rise above the whole neo-retro-alternative-whatever wave that's been bombarding our ears for the last 5 years?  NO.  <br /> <br />Well, Kasabian rises above.  In a spectacular way.  Though I am loath to compare them to anybody, they most sound like a very danceable version of the Stone Roses or a much funkier, more fun Elastica.  But that doesn't do them credit.  They're a truly original band. <br /> <br />And they've made one of those very rare albums where nearly every song is excellent.  I'm not exaggerating.  If you were really enjoying alternative dance music in the 90's and have found the pickings rather slim in the last few years, Kasabian will revive your enthusiasm. <br /> <br />And, yes, it sucks you can't copy the album, but it's so freakin' good, you'll want to play it over and over again anyway.
B0007GAERG|3.0|I like Mariah Carey's new cd.  To me, all of the songs are enjoyable.  The ones that truly stand out are: It's like that, We belong together (my favorite and one of Mariah's best songs), Shake it off, Say Something, One and only and Fly like a bird.  As I said before, the other songs aren't bad, they just don't stand out like the ones I just mentioned.  Some people say the voice is back; I doubt it ever left, it just doesn't hit the high notes like she used to.
6300214435|4.0|\\"Temple of Doom\\" is an exciting adventure story in the classic mold: exotic locations, thoroughly evil bad guys, wild chases, bloodless fights, and chaste romantic interest. There's a lot to like here, right down to the happy family reunions (!) at the end.<br /><br />It's a sequel to the instant success of \\"Lost Ark\\". That's logical, given the popularity of the original and the versatility of the Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) character. This movie suffers a bit from the sequel syndrome, though. The \\"screaming babe\\" and \\"cute kid\\" characters are almost perfunctory - her job is mostly to squawk and get saved, the kid's job is mostly cuteness. Well, they do good enough jobs in their roles. Also, the Indiana character is developing in the direction of a James Bond - the first scene is in a high-priced cabaret, with Indy in an evening suit. Is that really our Indy?<br /><br />There's a lot more humor than in the first movie, and that generally works well. The opening scene, an almost-familair cabaret song, prepares the viewer for later oddness. The initial scramble across the cabaret floor, too, is a good display of physical humor. \\"Temple of Doom\\" never seems to develop a split personality because of the disparate elements, though. They alternate well, without distracting from each other.<br /><br />On the whole, this has stood up to the test of time. (Is it really 20 years since this came out?) The adventure story is good, the effects are all they need to be, and the mind can shift to low gear while watching. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0007O38F8|5.0|I think the massacre is perhaps one of the tighest rap cd. Ski mask way and Position of power are dope tracks. 50 is not the best rapper but the beats are very nice.
0671027387|5.0|This book is more than I expected it to be, very big twists and turns.  Fabulously written, but then again they all are.  Draws you in, takes hold of you and won't let you go until you turn the last page!  This completes my DAN BROWN library.  Wonderful, wonderful read.
B0006399FS|5.0|It is hard to believe that a band can consistently make fantastic music for over two decades and release one of their best albums 25 years after releasing their first, but in U2's case, it's true.  The band members have matured both as musicians and as people, and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (HTDAAB) is an album full of wisdom and hope.  If you are looking for the dark tones of albums such as Achtung Baby and Pop, this may not be the album for you.  HTDAAB is generally optimistic, reaching a soaring, hopeful conclusion in the song Yahweh.  Bono sung in Always (a b-side on the Beautiful Day single) to \\"turn each song into a prayer\\", and in Yahweh, he does so eloquently, acknowledging shortcomings and fears but looking forward with hope and faith. <br /> <br />The album's start is less hopeful: it commences with the confusion of Vertigo, a song typefying the chaos of the modern world but disguised as a shallow rocker.  However, as the album commences, it lives up to its name - it dismantles the atomic bomb that is the frantic world we live in and busy lives we lead.  Listen to the album straight from start to finish: you start with the everyday chaos of Vertigo and come out feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after the joyful notes of Original Of The Species and Yahweh. <br /> <br />The album's high point comes halfway through - City Of Blinding Lights.  This is one of the greatest songs ever recorded by U2 (I personally think it's their best since Heartland on 1988's Rattle And Hum).  It takes the epic nature of Where The Streets Have No Name and the anthemic power of songs such as Pride and combines them with a solid dose of heart and soul.  Inspired by concerts the band played in New York just weeks after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, it is a heartfelt and reflective piece that Bono has also said looks back on the band in their early days as wide-eyed, naive youngsters travelling to big cities such as London and New York.  The album is worth the price alone for this single song. <br /> <br />This album showcases Bono's maturing political outlook and attitude.  Sure, yelling and swearing at politicians may give some people a quick bit of empassioned excitement, but it doesn't achieve anything or further any cause.  Bono's criticisms are now more subtle, and more intelligent for it.  Crumbs From Your Table may be U2's best political rocker since the days of War, and Love And Peace Or Else is one of the album's best songs, with a sinister, growling intro that sounds like a more evil version of Zooropa's intro.  Preceding Love And Peace Or Else are two tracks conveying rather different emotions: Miracle Drug, a song that synthesises the themes of science, love, and God, and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, an exceptionally well-sung and very emotional song that Bono sang at his father's funeral. <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own deals with Bono's difficult relationship with his father, and All Because Of You is partly autobiographical too.  This song, described by Bono as a \\"love song to The Who\\" and also in the vein of Rattle And Hum's Desire, can be taken to mean many things: an expression of Bono's faith in God and His power, a look back on the band's career, or a thanks to the band's loyal fans (or a myriad of other things to different people).  It is followed by A Man And A Woman, a song that, if not unique to rock music, is at least rare.  Why?  Because it preaches loyalty and love in relationships and marriage, rather than the shallow excesses common to rockstars.  It's also a great summer song. <br /> <br />Some songs are like a fine wine, and One Step Closer is one of them.  This tender, soft song is one you need to permit to wash over you; taste its rich texture, sample its rich flavours, and become lost in its beauty.  It may not sound particularly exciting on a casual listen, but if you sit back and take a deeper look, you will find much in the way of vibrance and value. <br/> <br />HTDAAB, like any album, has its negatives.  Most of these are found in the mixing: I personally feel Larry's drumming is not as prominent as it should be, especially in songs such as Love And Peace Or Else.  I also think it's a true shame Fast Cars is only a bonus track in some countries rather than a full album song placed either before or after A Man And A Woman.  If you can get a copy containing Fast Cars, do so. <br /> <br />Those negatives do not significantly detract from HTDAAB's great worth, and certainly not enough to lower the star rating from five.  If I could give it more, I would!  This album is a wonderful work, hopeful and realistic at the same time, made by four accomplished musicians with mature and thoughtful outlooks.  No good collection of albums should be without How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This movie was excellent from beginning to end.  If the only reason people dont like this movie is because of the graphic novel, then they, quite frankly, can go to you know where.  Take a look at how many horrible movies came out recently.  Garfield, Electra, Alone in the Dark, Boogeyman, House of the Dead...this movie is not one of them.  Keanu has his own style of acting, and if you cant get use to it, then thats your problem.  He isnt a bad actor. This movie is a very visually stunning, thought provoking, action film which should please anybody who isnt a fan of the comics, and wants to see something different...its not like they called the movie Hellblazer either, its called Constatine for a reason.  Also, the two disk special edition is fantastic, which includes a comic book, and a transfer which is better than the theatre.
0670033375|2.0|I loved Diamond's Guns, Germs & Steel, and had similar high hopes for this.  Unfortunately, I found it disjointed, anectodal, and very disappointing.  Although Diamond is obviously a good man and probably not guilty of this, I got the impression the Montana information was included so he could write off his vacations there.  There is valuable information in here, so if you're interested in the topic it's worthwhile, but this has all the hallmarks of a quickie follow up to a commercial success (Guns, Germs and Steel) you expect from a new movie star but not a Pulitzer-prizewinning author.  You're better than this, Jared.
B000002BFL|4.0|...which is a lot more than can be said for Vengeance of Religous Reformer Girolamo Savonarola. While he, and others like him, mindlessly hide behind the excuse that is American 'patriotism', he continues to protest the justice of a world order governed by the USA which allows only themselves and their allies so called 'wmds', while defending the right to invade and brutalize any country on the false premise that they threaten the security of the world.  The aforementioned moron below might stop and wonder how the 100,000 dead Iraqis feel about being 'saved'. Instead of the 'guns blazing' approach which Springsteen intelligently derides, a more globally co operative approach might have kept a few more of those dead out of their graves. You might also start to realize that if the states hadn't been pissing people off for so long in the Middle East, no one would've wanted to fly planes into a couple big buildings a few years back. Iraq linked to Bin laden? Saddam with WMDs?  If you still belive that then there is no helping you... Learn some history. Springsteen still believe in a nation of people FREE to follow their own religion and their own beliefs- as did the forefathers of the nation- not a nation that forces its ideology upon the world with its own weapons of mass destruction (convenientally referred to by the less intelligent American public as 'defensive missile systems', and such) Nazi Germany did that 50 years ago; forcing an ideology on the world whether they wanted it or not. They too, like America, engaged in   the sadistic torture of their prisoners and sought to restrict and limit the privacy of its citizens... What exactly is it about the war in Iraq that we are supposed to be proud of?
B00005ATQ9|4.0|My first experience with the film Barry Lyndon was in college in 1977.  A fine print was being exhibited by the university at an appropriately large theater auditorium.  Though I had been an avid Kubrick fan for several years, the generally sub-par reviews and unusually brief first run in a limited number of venues dissuaded me from seeing it upon its initial release.  Now was my chance for personal redemption!    For a solid three hours I was transfixed by the images, sounds, and rhythms of another time and place.  Scenes unfolded by way of sequences of slow zooms on static interiors and painterly detailed exteriors, always punctuated by beautifully framed wide landscapes serving as segues.  The characters' expressions, conversations, and speech patterns reflected their time and place; from the farms and fields of Georgian Ireland to continental mansions, estates, and battlefields.  Duels and battle scenes were presented as equivalent parts of a grand tapestry as opposed to high points of action in a screenplay. All were embellished with the languid rhythms of Irish pipes or the slow stately chamber music of late classicism.  Everything moved and transpired at the \\"speed of life\\" of another time.  It was wonderful!    In this film, plot is almost incidental as any sense of drama or character motivation is telegraphed by the titles and narration.  In fact, what could be called the film's climax is a maddeningly drawn-out duel set in a sequestered haybarn; hardly the stuff of your typical Hollywood epic, but certainly effective in the context of this tableaux of a \\"simple Irishman's\\" life and escapades.  In fact, the consistent deliberateness with which every movement was staged in the film helped lend a semblance of dramatic cogency.  Any sense of irony is also incidental, but for this viewer, it ultimately made the \\"journey\\" of experiencing this film that much more worthwhile.    Only one scene left me vexed and irritated: that being where the dying young son of Barry and Lady Lyndon plays \\"marriage counselor\\" to his parents with the two adults blubbering uncontrollably. Sorry, but this just reeks of incredulous sap!    This is a film to be absorbed and savored in real time, not necessarily contemplated in hindsight. Taken as such, it succeeds marvelously.  At only one point was I made overtly aware that I was watching \\"only a movie\\": the freeze-frame near the end as Barry descends from the carriage.  That moment was appropriate and well-contrived, and such was this film's grip on me.    If you care to make the journey into the world of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, be certain you have an appropriately large screen, three uninterrupted hours, and had plenty of sleep to perhaps ward off the hypnotically slow rhythms of this historic \\"never-never land\\" to which you'll be transported.  I believe you'll be amply rewarded.      p.s.: I found nothing technically objectionable about the DVD transfer.
6304712499|2.0|During the 90's one of the biggest comic book franchises around was Spawn.  Created by former Spiderman artist, Todd McFarlane, Spawn was the hottest comic book commodity out there.  Image Comics was, and still is the home to the anti-hero from hell, and with numerous titles bearing the name Spawn (Spawn, Curse of Spawn, and Hellspawn; not to mention the spin-off series' Angela and Sam & Twitch), the character was quickly becoming Image's powerhouse rival to competitor's at DC and Marvel Comics.  With the characters enormous popularity, it wasn't long until movie studios came calling that were looking to adapt the anti-hero into a big screen movie, which is exactly what New Line Cinema succeeded in doing, just not with any satisfactory results. <br /> <br />\\"Spawn\\" essentially is the origin story for Image Comics' popular anti-hero.  We are introduced to Al Simmons (Michael Jai White as Al Simmons/Spawn), an American war hero turned black-ops for the C.I.A.  His latest mission went awry when civilians were killed during an assassination attempt, a job that the C.I.A. Director, Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), had assigned Al to carry out.  After this job, Al is set to retire, but not before doing one final job for the agency.  This final assignment as it turns out is nothing more than a ruse, as Al is assassinated by none other than Jason Wynn, in a plot that comes directly from the pits of hell.  Hell is fighting a war with Heaven, and Malebolgia the demon lord of hell, needs a someone to lead his unholy forces to the gates of Heaven and burn them down.  That someone is Al Simmons, Malebolgia tricks Al into believing that if he leads hell's army then he can be reunited with his wife on Earth, and of course Al takes the bait.  What Al didn't know, was that he wouldn't be returned until 5 years later and that he wouldn't look exactly like he used to (in fact, you could consider him a `crispy-critter'), his new charred appearance isn't the only change Al has to get used to,as his beloved wife Wanda has moved on with her life and is remarried.  Now that Al's former life is officially over, Malebolgia sends his demonic underling Clown/Violator (John Leguizamo) to sort of torment Al and show him the ropes in learning his new hell-powers, and to give him the name `Spawn'.  With his newfound powers Spawn has some plans of his own, in his mind Malebolgia didn't live up to his end of the bargain, so Spawn isn't about to lead hell's army anywhere, instead he's going to punish those who are responsible for his new lot in life, from Jason Wynn all the way to the depths of hell. <br /> <br />This adaptation of \\"Spawn\\" had huge potential, but it just didn't live up to it.  Personally I'm surprised by some of the elements of the origin that were changed, especially since series creator Todd McFarlane was heavily involved with the making of this film.  Some disappointments about the origin are as follows:  Jason Wynn did not directly assassinate Al Simmons, instead he hired Al's best friend Chapel to do it (Chapel is not even shown in this film); Detective's Sam and Twitch are noticeably absent from all proceedings, I mean they could have at least been mentioned; and Terry Fitzgerald is a black guy, not a white guy.  Story changes aside, there were plenty of other problems with this film, the special effects while good for the most part, the scenes in hell were terrible, clearly they were trying to reach too far beyond the capabilities of their special effects creators.  And the biggest problem would have to be the story, it just wasn't that great of a story, the acting was good, but they didn't have much to work with.  Frankly, more time should have been put into making a really top-notch adaptation that was more faithful to the comics than simply trying to cash in on Spawn's popularity at the time.  At least the adult-oriented, animated series, \\"Spawn\\" on HBO was faithful, and truthfully much better than anything contained in this movie. <br /><br />If you absolutely love the character of Spawn then you'll probably enjoy this film somewhat, but will still be disappointed by the changes to the origin and other missing elements that make the comics so great.  Overall, a sub-par comic book adaptation, that could have been so much better than it actually was. <br /> <br />\\"Spawn\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Having most of the Remastered Judas Priest albums now, it's clear that \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" was the one that most Needed the Remastering process; the original CD issue was more toned down, with more tape hiss, than earlier albums like \\"Stained Class\\" - I would guess that \\"Screaming....\\" was the first Priest album pressed onto CD format, back when the technology was in its infancy. <br /> <br />With the Remastering, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" is a more ferocious, intense album than ever, which is saying something considering the punch it always packed before, even on tape on a relatively cheap system.  There is a lyrical theme to it, as there is with most Priest albums, although as always it's done in a loose way: the theme helps tie the album together without being so rigid as to limit individual songs, or to prevent the band from veering off course for a track of a different vibe every here and there.  I guess it could be said that the songs and their lyrical content guide the album's course instead of the album strictly guiding and controlling the songs.  With this album, that theme involves oppression - from societal authoritarianism, from loneliness or self-doubt, etc.; the desire to overcome it and break free; and often the success or lack thereof of those objectives.  \\"Electric Eye\\" - with its magnificent \\"The Hellion\\" intro, one of the most famous intros in all of metal - typifies the Priest staple of fear of totalitarian intervention into every aspect of life, with a concept that becomes more and more plausible year after year, and then is followed by \\"Riding On The Wind\\" a song that in every beat and note just bursts forth with the sensation of shattering boundries and accepting no defeat.  The drums throughout have a pounding jungle-type vibe and are perhaps best represented in \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" and \\"Riding On The Wind\\"; unheralded alltime classic \\"Bloodstone\\" features possibly the single Best use of the guitar twin harmonies/double solos/whatever you want to call it that the Priest has used to such great effect all over their career.  \\"(Take These) Chains\\" and \\"Fever\\" each showcase a different facet of Rob Halford's amazing vocal range. As an album, it doesn't focus nearly so much on the bloody retribution theme as its title would suggest, opting more often  for a 'living well is the best revenge' vibe (i.e. \\"..Another Thing Coming\\") and passionately sung lamentations about the sorrier aspects of the world's state (i.e. \\"Bloodstone\\").  Powerful, often hopeful and at times furious, the disc runs the gamut.   Every original track a great, the only one falling  short of perfection being \\"Pain And Pleasure\\" which is still a soild all-around track with perfect vocals for the material. <br /> <br />On to the bonus tracks: the main reason I and probably most other Priest fans were so excited by the whole re-issue project when they came out a few years ago.  Like most of the reissues, there's one previously unreleased studio track, one previously unreleased live track, usually a song from the same album originally.  The studio cut, \\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\\", was already available in a different, re-recorded version with somewhat differing lyrics, as one of 3 new studio tracks on Halford's 2001 \\"Live Insurrection\\" epic.  Upon first hearing the \\"Screaming..\\" version I was impressed but considered it a clear second to the \\"Insurrection\\" version; but on subsequent listens it quickly grew enormously on me until I now consider it every bit the equal of its counterpart.  A very different feel to the song, sort of \\"Turbo\\"-ish, with the partially different lyrics adding to its distinctiveness.  Incredibly emotional vocal performance, just as on \\"Insurrection\\".  The disc is capped off with a live take on \\"Devil's Child\\", a wilder and even more energetic version of its studio conterpart highlighted by a great, completely over-the-top vocal performance by Halford. <br /> <br />Extremely recommended whether or not you own the previous non-remastered, no-bonuses edition.  Like Accept's \\"Balls To The Wall\\", Rammstein's \\"Sehnsucht\\", Iron Maiden's \\"Piece Of Mind\\" and The Gathering's \\"Mandylion\\" (to name a quick few) this is as essential as it gets for a heavy metal collection.
B000002H2H|5.0|Having just hooked up my new surround sound system and listened to a DVD of a Metallica concert, I think it's a good time to write a review of my favorite Metallica album.  This is definitely the peak of heavy metal.  Reading the other reviews you probably know by now that this is a great album.  One thing that bugs me though is the term \\"thrash metal.\\"  It makes it sound like they are playing loud, heavy, and fast, but without much musical talent.  Well it is loud heavy and fast, but what makes it so great is that the songs have a dark beauty and intricacy about them.  So let's go song by song.    1.  Fight Fire With Fire:  I like the acoustic intro, if only because it is kinda funny considering the rest of the album.  When I first heard this song I really didn't like it that much.  It did seem like the thrash metal that I mentioned.  But it's grown on me a little, and I can now say it's better than 99% of music out there, although not most Metallica.  8/10  2.  Ride the Lightning:  Now the album really gets going.  Interesting lyrics, hard and heavy guitars.  This song pretty well defines the album which might be why they chose it's name for the album title.  9/10  3.  For Whom the Bell Tolls:  Maybe it's just because I liked the book, but this is my second favorite Metallica song (after One, oddly enough).  It has a rhythm that fits perfectly.  I've probably listened to this song hundreds of times, but it never gets old because of it's perfection.  10/10  4.  Fade to Black:  This is the slow song of the album, but it's still right up there with For Whom the Bell Tolls.  It's about suicide, so if you feel like blowing your brains out:  please don't listen to this song!  In this age of litigation, they'd find it in your CD player and the soccer moms will go straight to the \\"source\\" with lawsuits.  Anyways, I could say a million great things about this song, but they've all been said before.  10/10  5.  Trapped Under Ice:  If the last song got you feeling relaxed, this one will snap you out of it.  Lightning quick and heavy, I group this one with song #2.  9/10  6.  Escape:  This one is defined by the phrase \\"radio friendly\\", but that doesn't mean it's bad.  It has a chorus that non-metalheads can appreciate, but it's still good metal.  Seems kind of like a preview of the black album.  9/10  7.  Creeping Death:  Has a harsh sound and heavy riffs.  Gotta like the instrumental part in the middle.  9/10  8.  Call of KTULU:  Great way to finish off the album.  Excellent instrumental that's right up there with Orion (though people don't give Orion enough credit... it's great in a more subtle way).  Doesn't get repetitive despite the length and lack of lyrics.  10/10    So there ya have it.  This is an amazing album that I've listened to for a long time and will continue to listen to.  The closest thing to a weak point is Fight Fire with Fire, and it's still a good song.  This is the best 15 bucks I've ever spent.
B0009IOR6Q|1.0|This version was terrible. The whole scene where they have the sing off is cut out. When Cry Baby gets out of jail it goes straight to the chicken race instead of the sing off. I loved the original one but I HATE THIS ONE!!! They cut out a main scene. The whole point of the movie is the sing off and they cut it out!! I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!!!
B000003TAW|5.0|Started listening to this band recently...Really enjoy the cd... Wish Weezer would come rock New Orleans,La. or Baton Rouge,La.....
0812548094|4.0|I highly disagree with most of the negative comments on the review page.  I, personally didnt find either of them dull at all.  In fact I had difficulty putting them down ((and that is coming from someone who could not finish the Return of the King because it became so tedious...of course I have grown quite a bid since I read that:being in elementary school at the time I read it))   I also disagree with the comment that it is too similar to the Wheel of Time books, I have read to book four in that series and they are only slightly similar.  (Really, how diferent do you want them to be? There's not all that much you can do with this genre, and the human imagination is not as good as we would believe it to be) <br /> <br />I liked these books because of their similarity to real life.  (Obviously without the magic, Keeper and etc) Everything isnt all good, and there are problems that don't look like they will be solved...because not all problems are...Not everything is perfect.  The gruesome detail added to this, though it was often disturbing.  Also, it showed alot of the greed of the human race, and what people will do to gain power. <br /> <br />One thing that I didnt see others mention is that some the characters were slightly one dimensional, not in their personalities (which were well develloped), but in the fact that they were either good or evil.  There were none in between.  Even Harry Potter books have in between characters. <br /> <br />In conclusion, it was a very good book and I am eagerly awaiting the opening of the library so that I can get my hands on the next book.
B00005JNJT|4.0|I don't want to be critical of Tim Burtons \\"Batman\\" with Michael Keaton as the first caped crusader, which was fresh, dark and engaging when it first hit the screen, but this is better.<br /><br />Christian Bale brings vehemence to the role not seen before in my opinion, and although the story suffers (like all first installments) of a good deal of story explanation the end result is arguably the best Batman flick to date.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne, as the story goes, witnesses his billionaire parents being murdered and after finding no peace through adolescence into young adulthood sees what slender grips he has on truth and justice vanish as their murderer looks set to walk after an early parole.<br /><br />Disillusioned with the rising crime and general lawless mob rule in Gotham, he seeks anonymity and sets off to the Far East to witness the criminal mind, and lifestyle first hand, ending up embittered in a hell hole prison somewhere in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Enter at this point Liam Neeson (in another mentor role) who takes the raw and angry Wayne and subjects him to a tortuous training regime high in the mountains, in the hopes to enlist him into the \\"League of Shadows\\" a group of Ninja exponents thinly disguised as vigilantes, with some rather extreme methods and ideas on justice.<br /><br />After completion of his training, Wayne however, turns Neeson and his goons down and returns to Gotham to set about administering his own brand of justice to the decadent masses. With the help of his butler Alfred (played very ably by Michael Caine) and Morgan Freeman as a scientist working for Wayne Industries, he creates Batman, and then the story really begins to unfurl.<br /><br />This is a very good movie, and considering the talent on display is not (I'm happy to say) a CGI festival or cartoon revenge story. Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe as well as those already mentioned are well cast in their respective roles, and there is a real polished feel to the whole picture.<br /><br />If I had to make one complaint it would be the new techniques used in close quarter fight choreography that seem to be the norm these days. Very quick and choppy, may be realistic, but it does nothing for the eye, and in some ways reminds me of older movie special effects that were always filmed in low lighting to hide the stunt work.<br /><br />Other than that, just about everything is here, villains a plenty, the necessary love interest, and the whole story told anew, with a fresh approach that seems to stay faithful to the DC comics creation. I actually forgot about the other Batman movies while watching which is testament to the production here. Will Batman thwart the bad guys and save the day? - you'll have to see for yourself. I for one can't wait for the next installment.

B00006AUIG|1.0|this movie is very slow paced! and in my opinion there was only one scary part.  the story didn't make much sense either. i wouldn't recommend it.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Her voice is liquid fabulousness.  The songs are filled with hope, longing, loss, joy, love: life.  It's an extraordinary cd in a time where there's so much bland stuff. Somehow the reworking of old material is original & fresh while still feeling vintage.  It's a classic CD that I'm giving all my friends this year.
6304493681|4.0|But the similarities are endless, well this is the movie that the Matrix was based on so what are you going to expect. Anyway, this movie is refreshing break in that it's not artistic or too deep. It's all out action which is a blessed release after the mind jobs Akira and Perfect Blue put on you. But this anime is superb with more breath-taking visual effects than you could poke a stick at and a lovely score that could bring Scrooge to tears. As with all other things, i suggest viewing before buying. I have built it up to be a really good movie but it obviously won't be everyone cup of tea. Manga and Anime fans, knock yourselves out at trying to buy this, anyone else, try before you buy.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Funeral is experimental indie rock quintet The Arcade Fire's debut album, and I have nothing to say, except that it is sheer brilliance, indie rock at its best. Undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year, it is remarkably easy listening, yet full of musical depth. The only thing you can do is to buy it.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie is complex, what more can be said? it is hard to understand, but that dosn't mean you can just switch off and poo poo it on the internet the next day. I, for one, happened to think the acting was great, they took a risk with Ashton being a huge comedy actor, but it paid off. I really felt something inside me empathise with this kids condition and his desperation to make things right. It came out around the same time a Donnie Darko which, because of it being so good, a lot of people compared the two and decided to slate this one, whereas i took them both on their own merit and found this movie to be not only thought provoking, but a sad insight to desperation. A great buy.
0140120416|5.0|Excellent reference, but very challenging. To reap full benefits, get a listening course like Pimsleur.
B00003CWL6|4.0|Some serious eye candy in this movie! I liked the story to this  movie, it was good, and different. Kevin Spacey was great, as  usual, and the two teenage girls, were sexy and easy!
0783114893|3.0|How this movie gets 4 and 5 stars, I have no clue. This is an action thriller by no means a horror. I bought this flick becuase some guy gave me a heads up on how great it was considering he was looking at movies like Creepshow 1&2 and a couple of other classic horrors I took his word. <br /> <br />Let me begin with saying I thought  this kid would be getting harrased by this guy through out the movie in some what of a sense he does and what happens is for some reason this killer or hitcher is following him around setting him up/framing him.And this kid is accused of all these murders till the end when suddenly out of knowwhere he is presumed innocent . And needed to help convince the killer not to kill a new friend ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ). Thats an idea of what the movie is about I thought it was different from reqding the back cover. <br /> <br />The first 20 minutes of the film is good and wierd pretty creepy and goes down hill from there. The acting is very good just the plot actually kind of sucks. This movie is nothing more than a rental IMO so rent first b4 you buy ,wish I did. <br /> <br /> Some of the things going on are stupid like a a family of a mother , father and 2 little kids picking up a hitcher, who the hell in there right minds would do that with kids in the car. The second thing, this guy shoots down a hellicopter with a regular 6 shooter which is also quit stupid. the third thing the hitcher kills a bunch of guys well 4 cops in a station where the kid is locked up and he wakes up to an open jail cell not heraing a thing. Your saying 4 cops cant stop one guy. This guy in the movie is almost unkillable like a Michaeel Myers. the endingdoesnt make sense either. <br /> <br />the only  couple good things about the movie is the hitcher plays his role excellent alog with all the other acting and the other good thing is the car chases/action sequences are very good and well done and enjoyed them . Otherwords this movie does not offer mjuch leaves alot of things unexplained and tries to make up for it with some good chase scenes. <br /> <br />This movie is not horrible its good it just doesnt all fall together the way it should. Rent first b4 you buy so you are not misunderstanding off all these reviews plus the review given on the back of the DVD.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Low Wattage Horror mishmash lacks not only the right stuff to consider itself a good movie but lacks a competent director who knows what he is doing with the material he is working with and a lead actor who knows how to act. The story makes no sense and does contradict itself at the end of the film and the special effects really don't amount to much at all. Rachel Weisz does give the movie more than it deserved with her great performance but she's basically the only actor in the movie who knows how to act while the rest of the film is filled with actors who can't get past the horrible script that is making this the film as horrible as it is. I had never read the comic book but after a friend begged me to read it after I told him how disappointed I was with the film, I decided to check it out. To my surprise, the comic was not only well written but it was much scarier to boot. I don't know why the powers that be behind the scenes messed up so badly with this film considering the fact that if it stood faithful to the comic book, it would have been an amazing movie but with Keanu Reeves as the lead actor, you know up front that the people behind the scenes really did not care about what they were making.  <br /> <br />Avoid.  <br />
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Of course purists will always cry foul at the \\"messes\\", \\"disasters\\" and \\"heresies\\" Hollywood performs on their little \\"possesions\\".

This movie rocks, plain and simple, and all of the ignoramus who insist on the \\"adaptation\\" label will surely fail to judge it on its own right.  I am not a comic book fan, and I did not read any of the \\"HELLBALZER\\" (as a so-called fan of the comic books mistakenly typed, TWICE). I enjoyed \\"Constantine\\". And as for those who also did, kudos. Don't let the comic book crowd make you feel any less. After all, their limitations and views are theirs alone to suffer...
1552095258|5.0|A fine, clearly written book on paddle making. The author covers wood, tools, paddle types and includes plans for a number of differnt models including a child's paddle. Most require the use of some power tools but if you're stuck in the woods, paddleless with only an axe and a crooked knife you can construct a paddle. No crooked knife in your kit, you say. Instructions for making one are included, although you might need the help of a blacksmith buddy.
B000002L82|5.0|I believe it's not an easy task for any admirer of this legendary band to choose a favourite album from their vast catalogue. \\"Brotherhood\\", \\"Technique\\" or even this year's \\"Waiting for the Sirens Call\\" will have each one their own legion of supporters - with unquestionable reasons for every one of them! Plus, 1987' \\"Substance\\" is for me the best and most complete compilation ever published and is among the albums I listen to more often. <br />But, as far as my judgment goes, PC&L is the one I enjoy most. The main reason is that this album contains 3 superior songs which I've been listening now for so long without ever passing through my mind the word \\"tired\\" - \\"Age of Consent\\", the mythical \\"Blue Monday\\" and the lovely \\"Your Silent Face\\"; the ability to create such timeless classics is an attribute of only a few... but New Order have never missed it. <br />Apart from these pure masterpieces, \\"We All Stand\\" is the nearest we get on PC&L to the preceding and NO' debut album, \\"Movement\\"; \\"The Village\\" is a joyful song (I cannot think on any other adjective) and it's followed by a landmark sequence of songs - \\"5-8-6\\" & \\"Blue Monday\\"; the first couple of songs to reveal the new path NO would take from then on. <br />The last part of the album is not so intense although the instrumental \\"Ecstasy\\" is a quite good song - as NO' instrumentals always are. <br />No doubt this is one of the albums of my life.
1573223026|5.0|Although I generally prefer novels with a single protagonist, I ultimately enjoyed &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; in which the story is told by four separate POVs. This novel begins hilariously with a bunch of people at the end of their rope, on the verge of suicide atop a roof in London on that most suicidal of nights: New Year's Eve. <br />Here, a kind of suicide gang is formed, and ultimately this provides an excuse for some situation comedy-style conflict. Actually, this is quite a goofy book. Despite it's dark premise, it's mostly very light in tone. Nick Hornby -- whose other great books include &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (a masterpiece) and &quot;About A Boy&quot; -- can't help but see the comedy in the darkest situations.<br />We have JJ, whose rock 'n' roll dreams have reduced him to being a pizza deliver boy. We have Martin, former morning talk show host, who has disgraced himself (a romance with an underage girl, which destroyed his marriage and career). We have Maureen, a sad-sack, sympathetic mother who has never enjoyed her life; and we have Jess, a bratty and often obnoxious faux punk, who of course comes from a privileged family.<br />This is a light read, mostly, and there is enough friction between the characters to create a self-sustaining drama in which the characters come to grips with their wrecked lives. This is not a morose book at all. Ultimately, Nick Hornby's stamp is on every page; this is NOT Dostoevsky or Jean-Paul Sartre. Nick Hornby is a &quot;middle brow&quot; literary talent, not an academic or meta-fiction post modernist, thank god. I enjoyed this Amazon purchase and would recommend it along with another novel: &quot;The Losers Club&quot; by Richard Perez, which is also quite funny and similar in tone, but with a single protagonist, which makes for a quick, lively read.<br />If you're looking for a non-homework type literary experience, pick up a copy of &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; by Nick Hornby. It's great fun!<br />-------------------------------------

Rediscover this book that you loved as a child; it will be even more sweet and meaningful as you read it to your own children.   <br />Follow baby bird as he searches for his mother.  The sweet, little bird represents all of the innocence of a child as he naively asks animals, a car, a boat and even a \\"snort\\", \\"are you my mother?\\"  <br />This classic children's book not only has a beautiful story, but it lends itself well to the kind of animated reading that excites young listeners.  Read it to your little bird again and again!  And reaps the rewards at the end of the story when your child says, \\"you are MY mother!\\".   <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Thank you, Coldplay, for making this awesome new album. Most other bands would have given into the pressure by the 3rd album by critics AND fans: we love you, we want you, now change. Either way can be disaster. They get famous for a certain sound, then they get HATED for trying new things! We love you, Coldplay, and thank you for giving more more more of what we want.  <br /> <br />This isnt' to say its' perfect. Or maybe its' too perfect, because the first single, the Speed of Sound, can sound a teeny little bit like there big hit Clocks if your not paying attention. Or a lot. But WHO chooses big? Is it the big music corporations? Dont' we as the audience choose what we want to listen to over and over? Is it their fault if WE love a song thats' so close to there biggest hit???  <br /> <br />Thank you for being yourself, Coldplay. I am just going to love you the way you are. Dont' change because some people demand it. When you get old and gray you can pull out all the experiemental stuff - and I can hear it even in this album, its' very suttle. But now, just enjoy being you, a band with an awesome third album and unlimited potential.
B000099T2L|5.0|I honestly didn't have high expectations when I found out Beyonce' was releasing a solo album this past year. I was sure that her beauty couldn't hide the fact that she was an overrated performer, and this album would be filled with nothing but bubble gum songs. Her freshman LP Dangerously In Love did everything an album could do to prove me wrong. This is easily one of the more complete albums I've heard in the past decade.    Beyonce' initially gives everyone what they expect. From her two hit songs with boyfriend Jay-Z, to the dancehall-induced \\"Baby Boy\\" featuring Sean Paul, she doesn't dissappoint with her club-friendly tracks. Two songs in particuliar that put to rest my assumptions that this woman couldn't sing were \\"Me, Myself, and I\\", and \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" featuring the late, great Luther Vandross. In both tracks Beyonce's voice is perfect, and she seems to hit even the most difficult notes with ease. Another standout track is \\"Daddy\\" in which Beyonce shows her full love and appreciation for her father. In the song \\"Daddy\\", she does a great job of story-telling, and painting an image in the listeners mind.    If you're a fan of music, you've probably heard the album's hits \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\". What keeps this album in my cd player though is her amazing voice, and eclectic production which makes this album worth having.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I like Mariah Carey, I love this album.  It is, in my opinion, her greatest album ever.  It has become one of my favorite albums ever.  It has some slow songs, some hip hop, and a good inspirational song (fly like a bird).  This album has it all and shows that Mariah has not let herself go.
B00005JNSK|5.0|As I'm sure you have heard before, this is not a remake.  True, a movie was made in the past with the great Gene Wilder, but this movie hearkens more truthfully to the children's novel.  It pulls a much darker tone and mood from the sugary 1970s version.  And I think Tim Burton did a great job creating a different version that is in no way connected to the \\"original movie\\" (though I do think that this one is much much better).      Burton and Depp are back at it, pulling out incredibly strange and creative visions from the depths of their minds.  For Burton, the landscapes take the best of his movies and stand as genius in terms of presentation.  Once we get to see inside the Chocolate Factory, we are with Charlie at once amazed and excited.  Imagine actually seeing rivers of chocolate.  It brings back childhood memories where our imaginations were huge and not limited by the harsh realities of life.  Burton is incredibly adept at tapping into this inner-child to create images that as adults we might scoff at or think strange.  Most people fall into two camps in relation to Burton:  he's either incredibly weird or incredibly brilliant.  I fall into the latter category and applaud his rich visual style, especially in this movie.    Then there's Depp, the actor who has once again created a unique character.  Depp's man-child Wonka will, for good or bad, remind people of yet another man-child in our society.  On the surface, we have Wonka who creates candies for children, allows 5 of them to enter his \\"Neverland\\" of chocolate, and yet has an apparent sour core.  He has a clear distaste for children and seems to take glee in the various ways they are kicked from his factory.  It's lucky that he allows a parental figure to go with each of the 5 children.  Yet his character who has this apparent disdain for children, also has a huge heart.  And it is through Charlie that Wonka will finally show his heart and face his own fears.      The music is also, of course, fantastic.  Danny Elfman proves once again that he is a strong composer of exciting and different music.  He has been getting a name for himself recently, what with his continual work with Tim Burton but also in doing music for Spiderman 1 and 2.  His music, however, always works best in my opinion with Burton's style and here it helps accentuate it.      Your eyes will not be bored.  Many splendors are seen in the 2 hour block.  From the great Oompa-Loompas who no longer annoy me(and are played by one actor who is digitally duplicated), to the great Glass Elevator and the aforementioned rivers of chocolate, to even the slight homage to Stanley Kubrick's opus 2001, the movie is a visual delight.  It is also pretty faithful to the novel.  Overall, this story was great when I read it as a child and it's nice to see it pretty faithfully interpreted in a movie.  It will delight children of all ages.  A must see.
B0006284JQ|3.0|It seems like just about everyone here is either ready to tear Britney apart, or knows nothing about music whatsoever. I don't take either side, because I see Britney Spears for what she was: a transition.  <br /> <br />Ever since rock and roll has had an appeal to teenagers (always), there have been large record companies making money off of the pop hits produced. Over time the process has become more refined, including such improvements as merchandising, marketing, and, of course, a standard pop structure. Eventually (some time around the 50's or 60's, don't press me on this one) record companies realized that it was more consistent to hire your songwriting talent and your star appeal seperately. What does this mean? Singers don't have to write songs. Lou Reed is the earliest of this song writers I can think of, because I happen to know that he started out writing songs for a big record label. So, assumably, this trend continued through the 70's, 80's and the early 90's. <br /> <br />Now we skip ahead to Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, and, a little later, N*Sync. Everyone criticized them for not writing there own songs, which was ridiculous because pop singers had been doing that for decades. What really bothered people was the fact that music really had nothing to do with these bands' success. You could see the slow realization coming across the record companies' minds that they could promote these stars through video, merchandising, and movies, making music nothing more than a vehicle to achieve an image. At this point, decent songs were still being written for the singers, but the focus was slowly moving away from the records.  <br /> <br />So you say that Britney's songs have gotten worse? That's because Britney isn't selling songs. Music has nothing to do with pop in this day and age, and that's why Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys are no longer relavent. They were half-breeds: they depended on press to survive, but they were still trying to sell albums. Today's popsters have moved all the way over: they are businessmen, using the title as musician as a means to sell their real product. That product is, simply, anything with they're name on it. <br /> <br />I say that this album is worth the buy just for the historic significance.
0765348780|2.0|This book suffers from having way too much magic!  Entire armies are devastated by magic.  The ending suffers from having magic destroy the monstrous villains.  It's way too boring and a cop out.  Authors like George R. R. Martin minimize the magic to make the stories more accessible and credible.  Mr. Erikson had better tone down the magic if he wants to be taken seriously.
B00005JNSK|1.0|I won't go into discussing all the problems with this film, others here have a good job, but I had a few major issues that I feel need elaboration: <br /> <br />In the 1971 film, Gene Wilder as Wonka starts out as a great mix of likeable and kinda odd--and I LOVE how with each child Wilder gets more and more exasperated and sarcastic when telling the brats to behave, finally muttering  \\"oh...please...don't...do...that..\\" in this hilarious flat, weak, hopeless voice because he's now spent some time with the kids and realizes they never will listen.   <br /> <br />But in the new film, Johnny as Wonka dislikes all the kids upon meeting them, before any of them even says or does anything!  In the older film, the first big scene inside the factory was written and edited in such a way that Wilder asks Augustus Gloop not to drink from the chocolate river, Augustus ignores him and keeps drinking, and then falls in.  But in this new film, after Wonka encourages everyone to walk around and sample everything, we see Augustus has lost his balance and is a split second from tumbling over into the river just as Wonka says \\"Oh wait, you musn't touch the chocolate river!\\" Too late!  <br /> <br />A minor point I know, but it happens so early on and horrendously weakens the message.  This film new has Wonka hating the kids before he meets them, and then punishing the first kid (Augustus) with the suction tube not because Wonka warned him not to do something and the kid ignored him and did it anyway, but merely because, as this film presents it, Augustus was already falling in the river just as Wonka warned him for the first time?  (Yes, I know in subsequent scenes the kids are more blatantly bad and obviously ignore Wonka, but this is the first of only four child-offing scenes in the film so it should set a clear tone). <br /> <br />So kids watching this film might take home the messages:  this Wonka man obviously hates kids from the beginning, so why even try to be good, and, Augustus basically got punished for no reason, looked like an accident to me, so why even try to be good?  Brilliant, Mr. Burton. <br /> <br />Finally, what's up with Charlie and the Grandfather?  Great actors both of them, but after a great set-up they really don't interact much after going into the factory.  And what's up with not having the \\"Yes, we stole the Fizzy Lifting drink, but I'm a good kid at heart so here's your Everlasting Gobstopper back, I'm won't give it to Slugworth\\" scene???  Why is that scene not in this new film??  (I don't care whether or not it's in the original book--lots of stuff in this new film wasn't in the original book so don't give me that excuse!)   <br /> <br />Charlie really does nothing at all, there are no choices for him to make, no growth, no learning, no \\"I'm sorry I let you down and I understand I now win nothing, but here's your Gobstopper back\\" !!!  So, he's just bland and in the end wins not because he did anything good, but just because the bad kids were all eliminated???   <br /> <br />This was just all wrong.  I am the odd one out here?  Are today's parents really satisfied with their kids just being entertained mindlessly like this for a couple hours, when with a LITTLE more effort (as in the 1971 film), viewers can be entertained and leave with some kind of affirming message, however subtle or slight?  I really don't get this new millenium... <br /> <br />Interesting that they've titled this film \\"Charlie and the...\\"  when the Charlie character here is so much weaker/insignificant than in the 1971 film, which was \\"Willy Wonka and the...\\"  ?
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for the Eagles to do a concert DVD and the wait was well worth it. They do most of their hits in DTS 5.1 surround and they never sounded better. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great music. I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.
0517543052|5.0|BE HERE NOW is a cookingpot,a spiritual stew.If one understand this book,no other book is necessary. I read this book first time in 1985,and the taste of this \\"love Stew\\"has never left me. <br />A must for any serious seeker of Love and Thruth (Gods trademark)
B000002J1U|5.0|I love how this Album has such a different approach than other Zep Records...it has different style than the others, a lot more acoustic guitars...however, anyone who appreciates Zeppelin's other works will definitly love this , it's excellent!!!!  I love all the songs!  They're timeless!!  Recommended! A++++++
B000244EMO|4.0|I have sold my old DVD and get this one instead. The DTS is great for a movie like that. the picture has not improoved very much, that's why I don't give a 5-stars rating.
0790731509|5.0|This movie is a must have for anyone that is a big, or small fan of Paul Newman. George Kennedy is equally as great & keeps the movie going. The egg eating scene is within itself a must see & seems so real, I can almost feel my own stomach swell. Strother Martin is cool & collect with the line, \\"What we've got here is a failure to communicate\\". I give this classic 5 stars.
B00005JNSK|3.0|I disregarded all the previews and intentionally avoided rewatching the Gene Wilder version. I like the Wilder version, but I thought it would be to my advantage to go in with a clean slate.  I went for Tim Burton, and Tim Burton alone. First I must agree with Roger Ebert about Depp looking and sounding like Michael Jackson. I'd been saying that from the first time I saw a preview.    Everything in the film seems at odds with everything else. Depp makes your skin crawl(don't take that as a slam against the man's entire career.) The Oompa-Lumbaas are overly obnoxious and their songs are for the most part annoying and unmemorable. Sometimes I had a hard time discerning the lyrics, but from the ones I did hear I gather I didn't miss much.    As for Tim Burton-his contributions seemed the most out-of-place. The beginning scenes might as well have had \\"Tim Burton\\" stamped across them. The setting is dreary but hopeful. Then we enter the factory and I was hoping for a pastel dreamscape, not unlike those in \\"Edward Scissor-Hands\\"  \\"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\\" and \\"Big Fish\\". Instead, we get a loud, garish, overwhelming world painted with hot pinks and electric blues-some of it is actually a little ugly. Most of it, though is impressive to look at, but it's sort of like getting a present wrapped with bright wrapping paper that conceals a rather disappointing gift.
B0002UOK04|5.0|If you like any Finnish, Swedish or other similar metal styles you have to get this! This album was done by two people, Jari Maenpaa (Ensiferum) and Kai Hahto (Rotten Sound). This is the most amazing metal I have ever heard! Jari did all the vocals, guitars, bass and synth and Kai did the drums. Jari is a musical genius. He completly has his own style and does not copy after any other bands. But if you like sweep-picking solos, metal COBish keyboard and fast and heavy double bass drumming you'll love this. Every song is completely unique and Jari's vocal range is amazing. He covers everything from smooth and clean to deep growls and high screams. He is without a doubt my favorite guitar player and songwriter and this cd was my best metal discovery ever! This is the most melodic, beautiful metal I've ever heard! Trust me, if you don't buy this you don't know what you're missing! Also if you haven't heard Ensiferum you need to also. Its the former band of Jari and is more of viking/folk metal which is great too. Wintersun is one of those rare cds for me personally that I can listen to all the way through, over and over and I never get tired of it. Give it a listen you won't be disappointed!
B00005JNSK|2.0|He ruined Planet of the Apes and now has ruined The chocolate factory. If you go into this movie without comparing it to the original it's not bad, but if you make the mistake I did then you will be disapointed, and badly. I could go on and on, but I won't. I think my biggest complaint though is the song Pure Imagination isn't there. I can't write anymore just thinking about how this movie was destroyed is making me angry.
B000002JAX|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend. But I think it is more a gift for both of us.  It is a great CD.
B000002BE9|5.0|Powerful piano pieces and sultry vocals dominate this album as soon as you press play. Apple's supple voice carries the thoughful lyrics for each track. There is much to read between the lines of this songstress' (then) 18 yr old offerings. The simplicity of her ensambles meld the instruments used without drowing out the emotion packed vocals. Long after listening to this album the lucious voice and songs will stay with you with an intensity begging to be listened to again. <br /> <br />This is a good album to pop in to mellow the mood. The songs flow well from one track to another. Sparks of her maturity and musicianship come and go but this is definitely a wise choice to add to any collection that embraces classy offerings. It's an album that stays with you as I have had this in my collection for many years and was inspired while listening to it again to offer my review.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Roland Emmerich should have been making movies with Irwin Allen in the Seventies, given his delight in providing different ways to visualize New York and LA getting it. Here Emmerich doesn't even try for the tongue-in-cheek levity that saved \\"Independence Day\\" and attempted to (but could not possibly redeem) \\"Godzilla\\"; everything is done with an absolutely straight face as the laws of physics and logic are broken repeatedly. The fact that he cast genuinely talented actors like Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward and jake Gyllenhaal to speak his wretched dialogue seems, paradoxically, actually to raise the camp factor considerably, as does the fact that this film is made with a genuine message. Global warming, we learn, is bad... spectacularly bad, of course. The resulting storms must naturally head for the world's two most important cities (according to Hollywood), New York and Los Angeles. We get to see various landmarks of these cities (like the Capitol Records building) obliterated, as if to prove that we are not in Kansas City or Milwaukee. The British royal family is also threatened, as if that were the only thing outside of the USA equivalent to the Hollywood sign or the Statue of Liberty. It's easy to scoff at Emmerich, but his films are not simply schlocky but also, fatally, incredibly visually unimaginative. Opportunities for at least some visual cleverness proliferate themselves throughout these films, and yet his expensive shots in this film of an oil tanker adrift along the flooded Fifth Avenue (for example) are not made to look to look beautiful or even remarkably absurd--just expensive.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is a must own DVD for any music fan. The Eagles are one of the biggest bands ever to grace the music industry and this DVD proves that they really are one of the greatest bands of all time.  <br />There are 29 tracks on this two disc set, including two new tracks, one from Joe Walsh, the other from Glenn Frey. All the classics are there including \\"New Kid In Town\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", \\"One of These Nights\\" not to mention old classics such as \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Desperado.\\"  <br />Tracks from their solo careers are also on here. The epic \\"Boys of Summer\\" by Don Henley is great and also has tracks such as \\"Dirty Laundry\\", \\"Sunset Grill\\" and \\"All She Wants to is Dance\\" on the DVD as well. Glenn Frey has a couple of tracks of his own on there too, as well as Joe Walsh, who's \\"Life's Been Good\\" is definitely the stand out track on the two of the discs. Walsh is great in this song and has changed the a couple of lines in this song and I must say they are quite humerous. He is phenomenal to watch on lead guitar throughout the entire show and is a great character on stage. <br />Vocally, the band is superb. After listening to Eagles: Live on record and then watching Hell Freezes over, they have just got better and better as time has gone by. But on some tracks, Henley could go higher than what he does, but still they are fantastic.  <br />After being at the concert (I am actually on the DVD), I can say the sound is just as good as it was when i was there. All those solo's, high notes and so on sound as good as they were back in November. <br />This really is a great DVD, released by my favourite band. It has over 230 minutes of footage and is a great buy. 29 tracks, vocally brilliant, 233 minutes of footage, superb sound and visual clarity, does any more need to be said? <br />
B00005JKNF|5.0|Every actor and actress for this film was perfectly cast.  Maggie Smith should have received an academy award for her performance.  This film is filled with humor, drama, rapier wit, and wonderful scenes that you should show your household staff so they will know how to set the table properly.  This is now one of my favorite films of all time.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|My husband bought this movie, and I was not all that interested in watching it. But from the opening speech in front of the flag, I was gripped. Outstanding character study and moving meditation on the nature of martial heroism in an age of WMD. Patton, as played by the wonderful George C. Scott, is Hannibal and Julius Caesar at the dawn of an era of impersonal technology. He is a true warrior who is not understood by the unheroic age in which he is cursed to dwell.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|As a great fan of the Eagles I quite enjoyed this DVD set, although <br />somthing seemed missing,perhaps the other original member which would have just made it complete. Their music still has the same quality as it ever did and and although many years have passed they still draw the crowds.  What more can you expect from a band of professional musicians. I guess there is no stopping them and that first reunion seems to keep going on.
1400031087|4.0|I have never been an addict but in my opinion many parts of this book are very realistic.  I do have some experience dealing with drug abusers and addicts in my family and from my experience many of them think and behave like selfish jerks just as James does.  This makes most of the book very believable to me.   <br /> <br />There are some characters and situations in the book which come across as being embellished - but it makes for a good story.  I enjoyed this book and recommend it.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|There is way too much praise for SOAD's new CD \\"Mezmerize\\". It is too political and fans of music don't care what our favorite bands think. America has hurt the pockets of Holywood by not going to see their movies for having such negative political view points about the greatest country in the world. I don't want to see that happen in the music industry. JUST SHUT UP AND SING! Music... it is all we have left...                                                             Nothing against SOAD. I loved their first self-titled debut. But it's never been the same since. Well... maybe \\"Toxicity\\", but the line has been drawn with \\"Mesmerize\\"... and they drew it... not me.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is an excellent movie. However, like some of the other reviewers, I have to admit that the colors do seem a bit off. If you've never seen it on VHS though, you're probably not going to have any issues with the color and can enjoy the movie for what it is. It is a wonderful adaptation of one of the best books ever written.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Slipknot - once again came out with a crappy cd with screaming like someone being tortured! With songs with names like Pulse of the Maggots and Blister Exists it should be really crappy like the rest of slipknot's music. And really - those haloween costumes, gettin kinda old if you ask me. Now if you do actually like slipknot music heres a few easy steps to save $10! <br />1) attach fishing hooks to face (in any manner, just make sure they puncture the skin) <br />2) put your head in an oven and set it to 400 degrees. <br />3) get some trick or treaters to play some drums, and im sure you'll got the vocals covered ;) <br /> <br />In a nutshell - this is a perfect way to give yourself instant headaches!
0062513346|1.0|This is the worst book by this author that I've ever read. He apparently said everything he had to say in the Alchemist. Rambling and self-absorbed, this tale of meeting a nomadic tribe of women on bikes failed to squeeze out even an ounce of anticipation or dramatic tension. It was like he thought just placing a few strange characters in this story was enough to create a plot.
B000929AJQ|1.0|crappy cd! whoa nine inch nails sucks... their music is like hmm hard to explain... well any way i put it ill just end up saying this cd along with their other is trash. now about the backwards n on half their merchandise (Grade A crap if you ask me)they MIGHT wanna fix that. i learned to write N's correctly long ago. so if these juniors wanna sell, they better step up and start playin better... or step aside and let better bands earn that extra .00000001% money that nin is taking away. Ill put the same thing on a slipknot cd - just replace the nine inch nails/nin with slipknot and backwards n with holoween costume
1558216847|3.0|This book is the product of a meeting between a British reporter and a polish refugee in the 1950s.  The polish refugee went along with the book and the reporter wrote it.  The book has been established as untrue since the 1950s.  It has no credibility with anyone.  Its a nice story, but no part of it is true. <br /> <br />Slavomir Rawicz appears out of nowhere in the 1950s.  There is no record whatsoever of him before those years.  Not as a polish officer, a free polish pilot in England or anywhere else that he claimed to have been.  None of the British officials who served in India or Tibet during his arrival ever heard of him or his journey.  He could never point to even one person who could confirm any part of his life before or during the war. <br /> <br />Anyone who has travelled in those parts of the world knows that the journey as described is nonsense.  The descriptions in the book don't line up with the actual places.  Beyond that, no small unsupported group would have survived that journey.  You don't just cross horrible deserts without food or water.  You don't cross north-south through Tibet in the middle of winter in the way that was described.   <br /> <br />The person who calls himself Rawicz may well have served in the Polish Army under a different name.  He was almost certainly not an officer but may have been in the gulag and was relesed with many other poles in the middle of the war. <br /> <br />If you like the book as a story, enjoy it for what it is.  Just don't think that what your reading is a true story. <br /> <br />
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|The music remains excellent, and the features make the Dual Disc an excellent value compared to a music CD only item, but Bond is no longer pushing the edge outward, no longer trying to increase the envelope-- they are playing it safe.  Bond needs new work, Bond needs to break new ground, both in writing and in performance, and it needs to take chances. <br /> <br />Worth the money, it still only hints at the promise they once displayed. <br /> <br />.
B00005UKKF|5.0|i recently got this DVD and i was instantly reminded just why i love britney spears so much.   she performs amazingly (again!)  and is by far the most entertaining concert ive ever watched.  i've already watched it many times and it just does not get old or boring.  all the special effects are so sweet, the dancing sexy as ever and well, ill just admit it, britney is one of the hottest perfromers ever!  DVD definitely worth every penny and no real britney fan should go without this in their collection!

B00005JNBQ|1.0|Just tell me why peoples! Why do you guys LOVE this movie? First off, I saw it to see if it's actually funny, which it wasn't! Then I saw it to see as an independent filmaker, but I kind of felt it, but not really. If you haven't seen this movie, (well that's prety weird becuase the whole world has probably seen it by now), don't watch it.
B0009PRNVK|4.0|Do not read to much into the other review on here. This is a fantastic DVD. Maiden England captures Iron Maiden on their Seventh Son of a Seventh Son tour. Bruce Dickinson is one of the best metal singers EVER. Sure now a days, he may have to \\"strain\\" a little. But he can still blow away most competition live. And for the reviewer ahead of me to say Nicko McBrain is a \\"liability\\" is just a complete farce. Nicko is the man. Nicko is always so energetic behind his massive set up of thundering drums, and is no less of that here. Very good song list...I will watch it many more times....Iron Maiden is one of the best live bands to ever grace my ears. Their elaborate stage setup is just an extra bonus..Live after Death will remain a staple in history as one of the biggest, baddest live shows ever. This show is definately worth a watch. Cant wait till their next live dvd for Dance of Death tour comes out.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This review is for the 2003 Two Disc Special Edition DVD by Warner Brothers.      The basic story line is about three Americans down and out on their luck in Tampico, Mexico.  While staying in a cheap flophouse, Fred Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) overhear an old man named Howard (Walter Huston) talk about the thrills and shortcomings of gold prospecting.  Shortly thereafter the three decide to pull their resources together and venture out into the mountains of rural Mexico to find gold.   They quickly find out that there are many obstacles such as surviving in the wilderness, battling off bandits and perhaps the biggest challenges deal with trusting and relying on each other.     This movie does an outstanding job exposing mankind's weaknesses and flaws.  The reoccurring theme is that these three men realize that at any given moment one can take advantage of the situation for selfish gain at the expense of the other two.  Greed becomes problematic even to the point of considering murder for self-preservation.  There is great acting especially from Bogard, but Walter Huston, director John Huston's father, steals the show.  The wonderful thing about this movie is there are many complex situations and tough decisions have to be made each time.  The movie is slightly over 2 hours long, and it flew by for me.  I enthusiastically recommend it!    The film was shot in Black and White and most of the scenes are outdoors.  The DVD restoration and transfer are near pristine through most of the movie except for a one minute stretch 93 minutes into the story.  It's obvious that this segment was not restored and the flaws from the master negative are noticeable and a bit distracting.  It's a shame that Warner Brothers dropped the ball on that part of the restoration project although I would still recommend buying the DVD in spite of that glitch.  The rest of the DVD package contains lots of worthwhile bonuses such as a  biography about the life of John Huston, and the making of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.      Movie: A+    DVD Quality: B+
B000002UCN|5.0|Remember that this is an old compilation. I Have just noticed that buyers tend to overlook this album. The Year, 1976. One of my friends told me that i should have bought Wings instead of this. Well, Mr. and Mrs. McCartney (the late) are good but you need to look for a much more diverse sound. And you can only find it in Harrison's works.  <br /> <br />
B000050HTO|4.0|I would have rated this CD as excellent except that \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" is a very short version (It fades out after the first reprise) of a very good song.. Other than that, it covers all his essential hit songs very well...
B00001OH7T|5.0|After \\"Diamond Dogs\\", the world was thrown off balance again with Bowie's rumors of hanging out in a Philadelphia studio with fans sleeping at the stage door.  It was the same city he recorded the \\"Diamond Dogs\\" tour - the `City of Brotherly Love'.  Black/White Soul Love music from Bowie?  No way.  Yes way.  Although it was a strong departure, \\"Young Americans\\" has become one of those Bowie albums that are so unique and distinct in its character that you either love it or hate it.  It's all true soul funk with the magical backup of the late Luther Vandross's voice.  \\"Young Americans\\" made it as a modest single, but it was the collaborative effort of \\"Fame\\" with John Lennon that is the song of choice here.  There is nothing like it anywhere in the world.  Bowie's rendering of \\"Across The Universe\\" is an uninspired tribute to Lennon and \\"Can You Hear Me\\" is bland.  However, \\"Somebody Up There Like Me\\" is a true funky bass driven number that completely satisfies.  At the very least, this album is consistent and Bowie proves he truly has some serious soul.

B00064X282|5.0|After an absence due to personal problems, Clapton settled into the 461 Ocean Boulevard Florida estate to restart his career. It was a major turning point. His heady rock attitude was adapting to a mellower R & B with a tad more funkiness. \\"Motherless Children\\", \\"\\"Willie And The Hand Jive\\" and \\"Mainline Florida\\" brought out the best gut bouncing rhythm and blues yet. Jump-started with the Bob Marley single, \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\", Clapton gained back his old audience while bringing in new fans to the new blue-eyed soul in the USA. He included some nearly spiritual numbers as well. \\"\\"Please Be With Me\\" is a begging love ballad and \\"Let It Grow\\" culminates with the frenzy of a soaring synthesizer. Yvonne Elliman does a fantastic back-up job with her own sultry vocals and accentuates Clapton's soulful voice. The and this is the only format where you can get them.  Still considered one of Clapton's best, you can't miss with this one, especially in SACD format!
B000002J1B|4.0|Sometimes an album can be fascinating for what it might have been but did not quite achieve.  \\"Relayer\\" is hard core 70s prog with a side-long epic and two extended songs, a structure that recalls the brilliant \\"Close to the Edge\\" of two years earlier.  I'm not sure that remastering has helped - my cruddy old vinyl version sounds richer and warmer, and somehow more spontaneous.    \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" has a complex and unusual melodic structure and some great arrangements.  For my money, the emergence of the \\"Soon, oh soon\\" section does not match the impact of \\"I get up, I get down\\", the equivalent break in \\"Close to the Edge\\".  Part of the problem is intrusive guitar.  Overall, however, the piece succeeds in creating the sensation of a relentless, delirium-inducing ride to the brink.    \\"Sound Chaser\\" is possibly the most extreme track Yes ever recorded.  A few years later it might have become a piece of speed metal, a genre that did not exist in 1974.  It's frustrating to imagine how much this track could be improved with tighter production and editing.  Steve Howe's guitar playing is brilliant but not always completely in synch with the rest of the band - a precondition for the success of a song like this.  Let's hope Yes thinks of recording a new version that corrects these mistakes, perhaps in speed metal style.    The final track \\"To Be Over\\" contains a truly beautiful melodic break (\\"Childlike soul dreamer..\\").  Otherwise, I find its structure rather disjointed and the main theme verging on a nursery-rhyme.    In conclusion, there is plenty here to entertain Yes fans and prog connoisseurs.  For newcomers to Yes, however, I recommend \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Fragile\\", or \\"The Yes Album\\".
B0007Y08IS|5.0|OK, here's the deal with \\"Team America World Police\\": If you are deeply sensitive about your politics, culture, and identity, then this film will offend you no matter who you are. If you're liberal (and I'm completely unashamed of saying that I am liberal), you might hate the way this film pokes fun of Hollywood's leftist elite, most of whom reduce the critical issues of our time (global warming, corporate hegemony, war and peace) into publicity-grabbing cliches. If you are conservative, you will be equally offended by the way this film makes American foreign policiy look like ape-posturing and tears what we think of as American culture (Walmart, NFL, Burger King, etc.) a new ace hole.    Or, you could take a step back and remind yourself that this is not a political film and it is not supposed to get the major issues right. In fact, this film never tries to get anything right, including the realism of the puppets. \\"Team America\\" is sattire that polks fun of everything in America that is worth making fun of. I've read several reviews accusing this film of patriot-bashing. So what! What's wrong with making fun of patriotism? I've also read reviews that say this film gives neoconservatives a free pass while making fun of liberal opponents of the colonization of Iraq. So what! I'm one of those liberal opponents and I cried with laughter at how they were portrayed.    If you are comfortable enough with yourself and your cherished beliefs that you can laugh at both, then you'll love this film. If you are narrow-minded, deeply insecure, or convinced that your political agenda (right or left) must be reflected on screen then--sure--you'll hate this film. And of course there's the outrageous and hillarious puppet-on-puppet sex. It's enough to have the far right howling with indignation before sneaking off to pleasure themselves.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|After seeing them live in March 2005 I thought that was it. Seeing them and hearing them live was truly like being in the recording studio with them!

B00001OH7V|3.0|This is album is a complete paradox!  The title track is one of my all-time Bowie favorites and on this cd we get it in all its 6 minute glory (shame on EMI/Virgin for butchering it on the lastest Best Of-collection). <br />The other stand-out track is \\"Blackout\\", a fun up-beat rock/pop/disco song, however, the live verison on \\"Stage\\" is superior to the album version in my option.   <br />The problem is, the rest of the album drags. I dont enjoy the other songs all that much.  The ambient tracks are not as good as the ones on \\"Low\\".  <br />Summary: the track track rocks, but the rest of the album does not.  Still, worth getting I suppose.  Ps. Check out the under-rated \\"Lodger\\".....
B000819PKC|5.0|OK, first off, I am a Jamiroquai newbie, just getting to know them since hearing Canned Heat on Napoleon Dynamite earlier this year.  I don't know what rock I was hiding under here in the US, but I am soooo glad I now know JMQ.  I guess I'm coming at JMQ from a different direction than most of you... from the newest stuff to the older stuff.  And I hear what you guys are saying...  but I think the evolution of their sound is a great thing.  So what if they are going more \\"mainstream\\".  I think JMQ and JayKay are on the way to greatness in the US if they keep it up.  I hear shades of Steely Dan in the guitar riffs...  Stevie Wonder...  just awesome awesome stuff.  I haven't stopped listening to Dynamite since I got it.  My favorites are Seven Days, Black Devil Car, and Hot Tequila Brown -- though all of the songs are awesome.  Those 3 could make it in the US -- really put JMQ in the mainstream.  Well anyway, I hope JayKay keeps it up, and in the meantime I'll be going back in time to the earlier stuff....
B00001OH7U|5.0|This is probably one of Bowie's most commerical albums. Strong from start to finish. I can't get enough of that 10 minute opener! A good, albeit shortened, version appears on \\"Stage\\".  The tracks are all solid, no fillers;  we get six (long) awsome Bowie songs.  In particular, check out the title track, \\"Word on a Wing\\" and \\"Stay\\". The album is a perfect bridge between his plastic soul period and the more avant garde Brian Eno-trilogy to come.  This is the cd that really got me hooked on the Thin White Duke.
0380002930|5.0|this is my favourite book i have ever read. and i've re-read it several times, every few years or so. <br /> <br />it is exciting, charming and interesting. i recommend this book to everyone!
B00001OH7X|4.0|I like this album a lot. No, it's not a \\"Low\\" or a \\"Scary Monsters\\", but it's still darn good. Unfortunately, this album is often forgotten when people talk about Bowie's fantastic 70's. The album has two halves (sides), the first one is so-so, and most of the songs are annoying, although \\"Red Sails\\" is growing on me.  Then something wonderful happens.  One a row, we get \\"DJ\\", \\"Look back in anger\\", \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\", and \\"Reptetion\\", all stellar tracks displaying Bowie at his best!  I particularly like \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\", one of my all time Bowie favorites, and the dark, cynical \\"Repetition\\" gets better every time you listen to it.  <br />My only complaint is that the album is fairly short. It clocks in at merely 35 min, but then again, the last 18 min alone are worth the price of the CD!  Bonus points for the creative (and disturbing?) album art! :)
B0006M4SO6|3.0|Pat Metheny is by far one of my favourite musicians and I own most of his recordings, and as an amateur guitarist I am very influenced by his style. Almost anything he did to date (excluding the horrible \\"Song X\\" with Ornette Coleman) I would rate between 'good' to 'masterpiece'. What is amazing about him is that he does not deteriorate over time but manages to keep high standards for over 20 years of music.  However this one is a complete disappointment. An unfocused mish-mash of poorly-arranged tunes, with few moments of inspiration here and there that due to the length of the songs cannot be accessed directly. Even these are not something you haven't heard before from Pat and Lyle.  Metheny has the reputation of doing what he feels like doing and not what his followers expect him to, however this follower is extremely disappointed from this record, and the 3 starts are mainly due to the respect I have for the guy.  Hope this is not a sign for the beginning of a musical demise.
B00003000M|3.0|I believe that this CD makes a good attemp at recreating the persona of Bob Marley. mixing smooth rythmic blends of R&B and Hip Hop with Reggae, However I think the song Roots, Rock, Reggae, is a horrible slandering of Bob Marley and the roots of Reggae music. The song starts out with a duo of Steven Tyler and Bob Marley and continues with a rock version of the song with Bob Marley's voice dubbed in. Overall Chant Down Babylon makes a good attemt at recreating the spirituality and peace in Bob Marley's music.
0689878451|5.0|I'm a gay 17 year-old who bought this for my best friends little sister, and she just loves it... I have to mention I read it first and loved it, almost made me cry :)
0790729725|5.0|While \\"Goodfellas\\" is not my favorite movie, it is defiantly in the top 5.<br /><br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is a mostly true story based on the book \\"Wiseguy\\" by Nicholas Pileggi.  The movie very closely mimics the story in the book.  It is about the life of Henry Hill, an associate in the Lucchese crime family.  The movie chronicles Hill's journey through the world of organized crime, starting with a part-time job at a cab stand after school, rising to the heights of stealing millions through participating in robberies and hijackings, then finally how his world rapidly disintegrate after creating a large narcotics empire.  After being arrested for drug trafficking and facing 25+ years in prison, in order to preserve the lives of himself and his family, Hill testifies against multiple associates in the world of organized crime and evaporates into the federal witness protection program.<br /><br />Robert DiNiro and Joe Pesci perform brilliantly, playing blood thirsty, borderline psychotic gangsters.  However, I think Ray Liotta has the performance of his career paying the lead character, Henry Hill, a down to earth gangster who is interested in his women and money rather than killing.  The movie has much less blood than a Rambo movie and very few special effects, yet words cannot express how remarkable the movie is.  To me, one of the best scenes in the movie, the \\"You're a funny guy\\" scene in the restaurant, has no special effects at all.<br /><br />This is one of those movies has something for everyone, love, deceit, murder, drugs, corruption, graphic violence, humor, and mystery.  The only issue I have with the movie is that a lot of the details the various crime figures use in their conversations did not mean anything to me until I read the book.  Even though the movie is almost two and a half hours long, the movie does not seem that long.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an excellent drama.  This is one of the few movies I think belongs in almost everyone's movie library.n almost everyone's movie library.
B000056VIY|5.0|A great album definately worth a listen. Jennifer comes back with a little more \\"hip hop\\" style.

B00009MGGI|5.0|I recently rewatched these shows more than 10 years after first seeing them.  If anything, they were better than before although I already knew what would happen.  Ian Richardson's performance as Urquhart is nothing short of brilliant and his asides are often so dryly clever that I would find myself using the rewind function on the player to catch them again.  To get an idea of this tone, try to imagine somehow a cross between Brideshead Revisited and Yes, Minister.  <br /> <br />Somewhat surprisingly, the ideological and social issues providing the setting for the series, particularly in To Play the King, are handled more or less subtlely and maturely.  It is hard to imagine a Hollywood production approaching Urquhart's upper class attitudes so well that they provide a point of amusement, rather than burlesque.  From my limited knowledge of British politics, the governmental and party affairs are dead on point, although this shouldn't be terribly surprising from a program produced in England for a UK audience.  Still, this was remarkably refreshing when compared with the dreck routinely produced in the US by the Oliver Stones and Tim Robbins that are about as close to reality as is Star Wars or Harry Potter. <br /> <br />Another remarkable aspect of House of Cards and Play the King is their apparent roman a clef nature.  I was shocked repeatedly with how close the screenplay came in its references to -- and depictions of -- actual persons, particularly present and former members of the royal family.  If you are at all an Anglophile, don't miss this set.  If you won't purchase it, at least rent it.  The only thing that's missing is New Labour. <br /> <br />
B00005JNSK|4.0|In the world of movie remakes, you never know what you get.  Sometimes you get a \\"Psycho\\" style remake, a movie so like the original you are suprised someone ever produced it.  Other times, though, things work out.  You get a movie that is just as good or better than the orginal.  With this in mind, I can honestly say that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an excellent film.<br /><br />The film approaches the novel from a different direction than the movie.  Its producers claim this movie \\"follows the original story\\" closer than the first movie.  There are differences.  Willy Wonka is made into a three-dimensional character, we see the circumstances that led to his obsession with candy, how he meant the Oompa Loompas (now played by a single actor, the famous Deep Roy, multiplied a million times over via computer animation).  Charlie may be the same, but he now has a father as well as a mother and his home gives the phrase \\"fixer upper\\" new meaning.<br /><br />The film progresses much as the original did, but again there are differences.  The Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers are more lively, the feeling of the film more positive, the greatest suprise is a plot twist when Charlie - but I will not tell.<br /><br />All in all, I give this movie a definite thumbs up.  I liked the first, but I really like the seond!!!<br /><br />WHO CAN TAKE THE SUNSHINE.....
1883217040|4.0|awesome stuff, just what the doctor ordered. Unlocking the mysteries of jazz as we speak. All laid out clearly. I've been playing guitar for about 15 years now, mostly rock style stuff and wanted to get deeper into the jazz theory side. I saw this book in a music shop and thought it was perfect. All the musical examples are for piano, which makes it a little harder to access for guitar (hence the 4 stars) but it'll probably do my sight reading good, and having to work out the examples on guitar I'm sure will improve my intake of the information. <br /> <br />I'm about 30 or so pages in and have only scratched the surface.
0743233832|5.0|This is the fourth translation of Marcus Aurelius' guidebook I have bought, and by far the most accessible, understandable, and applicable to life as I find it. <br />  The 1945 Classics Club revision of George Long's earlier translation is more elaborate, but the brothers Hicks have made Marcus more relevant to our times. <br />  I have filled three index cards with quotes from \\"The Emperors Handbook\\" and propped them around my work computer. My favorite: \\"I do what is expected of me and let nothing get in my way - neither the inanimate, nor the irrational, nor the hopelessly lost.\\" <br />  Buy two copies of this book: One for home, one for work, and thus \\"have before you at all times the icon of an ancient who practiced virtue.\\"
0609610570|5.0|One of the best business books I have ever read.  The mixture of anecdotes, first hand experience, and high-level business knowledge is combined so well it reads like a novel.  I purchased multiple copies for the managers in my company. The knowledge derived from reading this book was put to immediate use and has shown immediated benefits.  Very worthwhile.
0743454537|5.0|Having never read any of Jodi Picoult's books before, I decided to give this one a try and I'm very happy that I did. It grabbed me from the first page til the very end. I understood the anguish of Anna, Kate and their parents. The ending was something I was prepared for but not the person I expected. After this book, I will read more of Jodi Picoult's books, She has intrigued me.... to a level that I can not explain.
0517548232|4.0|The last comprehensive review for this book was in 2001 and the world has changed considerably since then. Much of the book is a breezy, but substantiated rebuttal of the many flaws in economic polocies. The author makes a very readable case for the removal of tariffs and subsidy crutches for sick industries. But the author pays no attention to human-fallibility factor in ecomonics. The author notes that sick-industries need to die out to provide breathing space for more nascent ones. This, according to the author, is also essential for freeing workers for the new industry. This statement does not say anything about the disruptive nature of this change or the difficulty and time-consuming nature of such a transition. Skills become obsolete in a matter of a few years or even months in the current marketplace and re-learning new skills at a considerably advanced age is no small issue. A basic comprehension of this fact and its treatment is missing from the book, but this is no fault of the author. The book was written in a time when the only major transitions were from the cottage-textile industry to the industrial, and the sunset of the agricultural economy. All said, this book is still the best introduction I've read. Understand the basic concepts as simple parables. The beautiful complexity and nuanced points can be explored later
0060005688|4.0|Strangely I liked the book although I am not in full agreement with the author about more choice depreciating the quality of present day life.     More choice brings with it more information which demands additional effort expended in terms of money, time and information processing (done by human brain in this instance) to sift through the chaff and choose the best or good enough. Humans are lazy beings at core, we abhor extra effort but now we have a bigger pool to choose from compared to earlier generations in almost all areas of modern life - ranging from picking a toothbrush to picking life partners(this can be debated separately). The author iterates we as consumers are generally untrained in wisely choosing & we choose in such a way that in most cases we remain dissatisfied. Hence, more choice is opening up more avenues for discontent. The paradox is that choice that is supposed to give us satisfaction ends up in us adapting to it before we actually spend time enjoying it.     Progress has brought us choice but maybe its hasn't taught us how to wisely choose. Education has taught people to read but what is to be read is entirely upto them. This book can be a good starting point for schooling ourselves in making and living with choice that truly improves our standard of living or brings satisfaction or whatever it is that you are looking for.     I agree with all the observations the book lists about modern instant-gratification-high-consumption-low-satisfaction lifestyle but \\"More is not Less\\" as such, 'More' comes at 'More' cost like conceptually its supposed too. We need to wise-up to it.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Mezmerize is not as good as toxicity and is nothing compared to there first album most of the songs are good higlights include violent pornogphy which sounds like old system of a down, question which is a rockin song with great riffs. some problem s with this album is Daron's singing which is really bad but it's listenalbe. very short cd only about 30 min. look forward to hyponotise
B00068IOWC|2.0|This album is a perfect example of how a band in decadence looks and sounds. When I first heard the first single `Vertigo' I thought they were joking, I could handle `All that you can't leave behind' but this one is just too much.<br /><br />Let's not talk about their music but of all the marketing campaign and the commercial phenomenon they have become. In their origins U2 didn't have an image, they have ideals and they expressed them, Bono was not a public figure but an opinion leader who you just had to consider seriously, to see him now doing all the things he didn't do as a young man is one of the saddest things a fan can see, his posing for the cameras and the videos, wearing an image of a rock star... anyways, the band has chosen a path that will make them last for a while longer, they have chosen to become commercial, the political idealists and critics from `War', `Boy' and `The Joshua tree' are gone for good now.<br /><br />The experience of listening to this album is easy to define, this is `All that you can't leave behind part 2', the songs sound basically the same and the vocal style of Bono has deteriorated incredibly (listen to `City of lights' for example) They stopped innovating and being experimental, their previous works like `Achtung baby', `Zooropa' and `Pop' where experimental in many ways and each one of them had a new proposal and evolution could be heard in both lyrics and sound; now, U2 has stuck in a moment in which everything they do sounds the same.<br /><br />This album is ideal for young people used to many of the `one hit bands' from nowadays as a perfect introduction to a band that used to be the greatest band on earth. With this album, U2 remains as a shadow of their brilliant trajectory. Opinions may be divided among fans, I personally have followed the band for many years now and just don't like it, I have tried to find something appealing and came to like `Crumbs from your table' but that's the most I have achieved.<br /><br />The Bonus DVD has nothing valuable to offer, a short documentary on the making of the album and the songs and some `videos' that are nothing but studio performances dubbed with the album songs with the exception of an acoustic performance. The sound is stereo PCM (I wouldn't listen to it in my home theater anyways, so the lack of 5.1 or higher didn't bother me) and is presented in widescreen format. I don't think the extra DVD is worth the extra money you pay from the regular version.<br />The Bonus DVD has nothing valuable to offer, a short documentary on the making of the album and the songs and some `videos' that are nothing but studio performances dubbed with the album songs with the exception of an acoustic performance.

Miller clearly loved the Man, and had his own personal agenda: \\"I had just turned 30.  For just once, I wanted Bruce Wayne to be older than me again.\\"  The twilight of the Batman, as portrayed in \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" hadn't been done before; it allowed Miller to distance himself from what everyone had done previously on the character, and find his own way. He drew and wrote it all himself, and took his graphic style one notch closer to the stark, brilliant chiarscuro that would define \\"Sin City\\".  He used maddeningly shapless abstract blobs of ink to represent the cape in motion, hanging over a drain pipe, covering an adversary's face-- and it worked incredibly well.  He used tiny panels of TV commentators like a Greek Chorus, weaving myths and anecdotes around the main action. <br /> <br />It was very popular.  No one wanted it to end.   <br /> <br />When it did, Miller, or his editorial staff, had the idea to follow it up with another story from the other end of Batman/Bruce Waynes life. Although the story of the murder of Wayne's parents in Crime Alley had been told ad infinitum, Miller realized that no-one had ever told the story of how Wayne actually created the Dark Knight.  This gave Miller the opportunity once again to tell the emotional story of who he is (both Wayne & Miller) without being encumbered by the baggage of 60 years of Detective Comics.   <br /> <br />This time, Miller got his old Daredevil collaborator David Mazzuchelli to draw the story, creating a very different effect than Miller's own artwork had on the The Dark Knight Returns.  Mazzuchelli more than rose to the occassion; he suddenly created a new way of drawing that seemed to fuse Bob Kane's original flat, vital, crude pulp style, with a literary, photographic brush stroke that delineated not the outlines but the shadows; like the earlier Daredevil artist(and Tomb 0f Dracula/Blade creator) Gene Colan. The result was astonishingly fresh, deceptively simple, and surprisingly evocotive of character. <br /> <br />Miller also worked against expectations by putting Batman/Bruce Wayne in the background of his own comic, focusing rather on the story of usually under-used Jim Gordon.  This was a different device, apart from the storytelling strategies in TDKR, to maintain the title character's air of mystery and shadow even as we watched him stumble through his puppyhood. We watched Gordon grow in the foreground, only glimpsing Wayne in our periphery.  <br /> <br />I didn't know I could say so much about one story.
B0007P3582|4.0|Overall, The Massacre is a good album.  The beats on the album mastered by Dre and Eminem make each song worth listening to.   By far the best album that 50 Cent has come out with.
0316168815|5.0|There's a few books that I simply won't share and Sebold's debut, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of them.  <br /> <br />I've read it twice now, the first time in book form, and the second time as an audiobook. Both reads felt fresh and magical. This is a book worth discovering. Susie's death is unspeakable--but her life after death is a process of growth and discovering a new future. The topic of this book made me uncomfortable because Susie's murder is horrific, and her death tragic. <br /> <br />The book isn't focused on that, though. The story is about finding a new beginning in an ending. It is lifte me up, even as parts of it broke my heart.  \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is satisfying on a story level, while Sebold's rawness and vision bring healing and comfort. Also worth noting is that her unusual approach to telling Susie's story (i.e. having Susie narrate the story from Heaven) is a bold one that works, so for writers, this book is absolutely worth studying to grow in their craft. <br /> <br />Don't miss out--you simply must read this story!
B0007VZ9DK|1.0|This product was sold to me with a defect, ordered another one and was sent out a used copy, also with a defect !
0440211727|5.0|This is more than a story, this is a social commentary. I admire how John Grisham is able to give you his opinion about special interest groups without sounding bitter or preachy. I couldn't put it down.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Awesome, if you're an Alien fan, this is a definite for your collection. NINE DVD's. Unbelievable, theatrical editions and the directors cut plus all the extras you could possibly dream of all put in an awesome package. THX certified.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Mere words can't describe Sigur Rs. <br /> <br />it doesn't take a genius to imagine what \\"thom yorke's favourite band\\" might sound like. lyrics sung in hopelandic, a language that has no translation, melodies that gods would play to soundtrack the dawn of time, played on instruments you've never heard before.  <br /> <br />welcome to iceland's Sigur Rs, where words don't exist and six minutes of one melody repeated is a pop song. not taxiride then.  <br /> <br />while little has changed since their debut, when your music is this distinctive you leave change to those struggling in the shadows of others.  <br /> <br />( ) is...  <br /> <br />What is ( )? <br /> <br />Astonishing, simply astonishing. there's no straightforward way to describe what Sigur Rs did and how they sounded on this piece of art. You can talk about the instruments: guitars, cello, horns, violins, drums, keyboards, various electronica and sometimes orchestras. and that gives you some idea of the eclectic nature of the sound sources but no real understanding of what the group does with it, how they can bend shapes into spectral shimmers or other-worldly cascades one minute, caress with an ambient sparseness surrounding solo piano the next and then drive hard with vaulting guitars.  <br /> <br />In the face of today's relentlessly aggressive commercialism, few approaches could be more revolutionary as Sigur Rs and ( ).
B0006399FS|5.0|After Achtung Baby (Masterpiece) this album is their second best. I would definitely recommend it!!!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|But why would it be? That was over a decade ago people.  <br />This is a very strong, diverse disc that didn't leave my player for a week. Highly recommended.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I WATCHED this movie for three reasons:  1) I'm from North Carolina, 2) I love movies based on or around the great wars involving our country, 3) Giovanni Ribisi had a small role in the movie.   <br /> <br />I HATED this movie for 3 reasons:  1) Long, 2) Boring, 3) Giovanni's role was TOO small and I was totally unimpressed with the character he played. <br /> <br />There is good news.  As disappointed as I was in the movie in general, Renee Zellweger (whom I've never been overly fond of) saves the picture.  Had it not been for her character, I would have fallen asleep much sooner and would have probably not even bothered wasting my time to write this review at all.   <br /> <br />If you're interested in a real war movie, buy Saving Private Ryan instead.  This one just doesn't cut it.  Highly over-rated.
B000683VI4|5.0|A beautiful story I really enjoyed it.  I can't wait to read the book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't explain it, but you have to watch it. You'll fall in love!
B000002UAU|4.0|... but the Beatles' 1967 masterpiece, \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" is still an excellent addition to any collection. The album has been overhyped with the-greatest-album-ever cheerleading, but that honor goes to the Beatles self-titled double-album (\\"White Album\\").  <br /> <br />That being said, this one is too indulgent, with such lackluster pieces as McCartney's 'Fixing a Hole' and Lennon's 'Good Morning, Good Morning' thrown in with such classics as 'When I'm 64' and 'A Day in the Life.' Also, this album was meant to be heard as a whole, and until it's reissued with \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane,\\" it's not a whole. Buy this after you have 'Beatles 1' and 'The White Album.'
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Differences are numerous, and it is easy to understand why so many fans dislike the film for it utilizes the name of the character and genre of the original in an almost mere brand-licensing approach to get the money from the fans while the fans experience an adaption of the original, if at all, that eternally evades any proximity (except the part where K flipped the bird to Satan). And if the value of a work is solely based on its proximity to an original concept, work, signified etc, I would give the film one star and period. Nonetheless, while the marketting strategy is almost a scam in this case, I find it hard to say that the film is not worth watching in itself. Great F/X, nice rendition of the worlds, clear plot, above average performance (this includes Keanu), and a few very suitable dialogues some might consider poorly written. But, then again, I do think that this is a work that has the potential to become a great one were it not an action thriller and if it gave more emphasis on characters. <br />I want to give it a 3.5, but didn't see the option.
B000003TAB|5.0|So, you're a big fan of Nirvana? You've got Nevermind, In Utero, and managed to track down Bleach, but you still feel like something's missing. Of course there is. You'll need this odds-and-sods disc. Originally slapped together by DGC for the Christmas 1992 market, this is particularly useful for a Nirvana fan, because it contains the two B-sides to \\"Blew,\\" both sides of the \\"Sliver\\"/\\"Dive\\" single, BBC sessions, and experimental metal tunes from the \\"Bleach\\" era. All in all, you should buy this disc, even if a couple of the songs are not quite up to Cobain's usually high standards. Jump in, realizing this is a B-sides disc, and you won't be disappointed.
B000063DHK|5.0|Like many reviewers have already stated, this is without a doubt, one of, if not, THE best live metal album ever. This live album chronicles Maiden at their absolute peak during the World Slavery Tour. Even if you try, it is hard to find a weak spot in this album. <br /> <br />To start off, the musicianship is superb. Nicko does an excellent job on the drums. Steve is phenominal as always, and both guitars are clearly seperable, but yet work together very nicely. Bruce gives a good performance, although it falls a little short of his performance at Rio de Janeiro (Rock in Rio).  <br /> <br />There are some songs that actually sound better live than their studio version. Just to name a few songs that sound better live: 2 Minutes to Midnight, Flight of Icarus, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Running Free, and Children of the Damned. Of course, some songs suffer a little bit, but keep in mind its live.  <br /> <br />This album surpasses the two live albums released by Maiden in the early 90's by a large margin, and beats the excellent Rock in Rio not by a whole lot. If you are a Maiden fan, you need this ASAP, and if you are a casual fan you should also buy this excellent live album.
B00006V9A0|4.0|That's what this should have been called. The job of a greatest hits collection is to tell the story of a band, and this disc only partially does so. I only awarded this 4 stars, because the music that's here is magnificent. This clocks in at a pitiful 50 minutes, which means 25 more minutes of music could have (and should have) been included. \\"Love Buzz,\\" the band's first single, is absent. \\"Been a Son\\" is here, but it's A-side \\"Blew,\\" is not. \\"Dive\\" and \\"Aneurysm\\" both are absent. \\"All Apologies\\" isn't here in it's album version (the version that was a #1 rock hit). And \\"You Know You're Right\\" should NOT be at the beginning of the album, seeing as it was the last song Nirvana recorded. And since there's still empty space, even if the songs I mentioned were added, none of the songs from the Fecal Matter demo have been released as of yet. An insult to Nirvana's fans, buy this disc used for the new single \\"You Know You're Right\\", and the single edits of \\"Been a Son\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\". Or better yet, have a friend burn it for you. This is nothing but a cash cow selling milk we've all had before.
B0009MDPYM|2.0|Not only is it predictable, but the Catholic \\"theology\\" that constitutes a major plot point in this movie is all wrong.  We hear throughout how suicide is a mortal sin, and suicides go straight to hell.  Newsflash, scriptwriters:  The Catholic church has not considered suicide a mortal sin for decades, so to have bishops and other people in-the-know in this film spouting that nonsense is pretty ridiculous. <br /> <br />This is a pretty typical special-effects action movie, only with demons.  It's entertaining enough, but hardly the sort of movie you'll watch twice, unless you have extremely low standards, or your only other choice is a made-for-t.v. movie on the Lifetime Channel. <br /> <br />Much of what goes on in the movie isn't fully explained.  We never find out, for instance, why the demons that \\"can't\\" inhabit our world are suddenly able to...is it just because the Antichrist (or whatever he is in this movie), is coming?  He needs a reception party?  Are they on recon?  What?   <br /> <br />These demon flicks are usually much better done with understatement.  Think Rosemary's Baby.  Think Fallen.  Rosemary was creepy.  Fallen was suspensful.  They both accomplished their objectives without a tedious over-reliance on computer effects.  Why?  Because they had good stories and interesting characters.  Someone ought to remind the suits in Hollywood that what we don't see is usually far scarier than what we do see.  And a good actor is worth a thousand computer-generated images. <br /> <br />Peter Stormare makes a wonderful appearance as Satan.  It is, sadly, much to brief. <br /> <br />
B000002UA0|5.0|Let me begin by stressing, this is vastly different from anything else Pink Floyd ever recorded, possibly because all the songs, save one, were written by original guitarist/singer Syd Barrett. Barrett specialized in two-minute acid-pop gems, unpredictable guitar work drenched in echo and feedback, and studio effects, such as the duck noises that close the album. And it works. \\"Piper\\" is equal parts driving, mysterious rockers ('Lucifer Sam') and  odd character sketches ('The Gnome'). \\"Matilda Mother\\" shimmers with psychedelic beauty, and \\"The Scarecrow,\\" possibly the best song Pink Floyd ever recorded, will grab you with the line 'he's resigned to his fate' in light of subsequent events. The bottom line: this is an album worth closely exploring.
B000002LGA|5.0|Lou Reed has contributed a lot to our culture for almost 40 years now, starting with the Velvet Underground and his days with Andy Warhol, his early 70's hits that gave him tons of radio play (Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side), his marriage to Laurie Anderson, his occasional appearances in film, etc.  But nowhere else was he able to make a continuous conceptual statement as powerful as he did in 1989's New York.  This is not just a good album of music.  This disc is poetry, street music, great visualization, social commentary, and nothing short of sheer sonic magic.  You listen to this for 10 minutes, you can smell the New York of the late 80's and early 90's.  Before Giulliani cleaned it up and turned Times Square into Disney North.  It was a lot more dangerous back then, but a heck more interesting too.  No one writes better about drugs and the streets than Lou.
B000003TAL|5.0|If you're sick of all the generic alternative rock on the radio, Sonic Youth's 1988 album 'Daydream Nation,' a sprawling, 70-minute treatise on pop culture, awaits. This is probably the best place to get into the band, because although this album is filled with noise collages and most of the songs go on for 7 minutes or longer, the band was also paying attention in pop class, writing their most cohesive choruses here. If you have a good pair of headphones, this album is a sonic landscape (pardon the pun) waiting for you to explore. Plus, it's usually cheap in stores where it's stocked, so buy it.
B00006EXL5|5.0|One of the Best Albums of all time. that's all i have to say. A lot better than \\"TCFSR\\" <br /> <br />Best Song: Vampires Will Never Hurt You
0060987464|5.0|In a matter of a day, I had read \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" By Marilyn Manson and it was the most amazing book I've ever read. I couldn't put the book down for one minute. Me, being a Manson fan, I have a lot more respect for him and what he went through as an artist.
0451191153|5.0|I saw the movie years ago -- and was I floored.  Man, what a movie.<br /><br />I ran to mom and told her the greatest old movie I just saw about an architect and his troubles and how he overcomes it all and becomes the greatest of all time.  She said, \\"you think the movie is good, read the book.\\"<br /><br />Fast forward 30 years.  I run to the store and pick up a copy. I sat down hoping to get past the first chapter.  Before I got up, I was on page 150. The print was horrible, the size of the pica petite, and yet my old eyes could not get away from the richly textured and tremendously clever and seemingly contrarian dialogue.<br /><br />She is a master. The story is great (except the acceptance of an apparent date rape in the middle which by today's standards would not be forgiven). I rave about this book.<br /><br />Now, mother tells me to read ATLAS SHRUGGED. I will.  But, this time I am going to the library and getting the hardback with better print.
B00005JNSK|4.0|I'm a big Tim Burton fan but after seeing the trailers I thought this movie looked stupid. After seeing it though, I think it's one of Burton's best. It's full of strange humor and great visuals. Roger Ebert said he didn't know what Johny Depp was trying to do in this movie as Willy Wonker. Well isn't it obvious what he was trying to do ? He was trying to be strange and unusual and he pulls it off great. He's not gonna be nominated 3 years in row though. As he's not as good as he was in Pirates of the Carribean or Finding Neverland. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonker seemed mysterious and almost sort of magical. This Willy is mysterious as well but looks like he'd eat the children that he doesn't like lol. Still though the movie has a likeable goofy charm to it, as does Depp. So I don't see where he's really a problem.<br /><br />  When the first trailer hit theatres and the internet. Fans of the original were already here writing bad reviews. Saying that the OOMPA LOOMPAs aren't what they should be like. Well they aren't freaky colored midgets. They're what Burton thought they should be like and they steal the show. They're clones of one small strange guy basically. It's great fun everytime they're on screen.<br /><br />  The whole movie is just an odd and darkly funny blast. I also think Danny Elfman does one of his best musical scores next to Batman and BeetleJuice. The flashbacks of Willy's childhood isn't really needed. Well although they are funny in a sick kind of way and Christopher Lee is great as his father. He's a dentist that makes Willy wear a huge thing of braces over his whole face. Of course he won't let him eat candy either and hates candy.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a lot more solid than the last time Burton attempted to do a remake. I could never get into the original and this is easy to get into.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm one of those idiots that never watched this show while it was on television.  I think I saw maybe half of one episode before it got cancelled.  Man, if I could have that to do over again... Firefly is an awesome series.  Like all classic shows (particularly sci-fi) it is a bit inaccessible at first, as you're bombarded with images, characters, plots, and roles that come at you from dizzying angles and without immediate resolution.  However, that chaos eventually becomes Firefly's great strength, which sadly is only evident over the long term.  Firefly is what I wish the new Star Wars movies had been:  long on character development, full of style, and never quite what it seems.  Just when you think you have each character, from the taciturn but loveable captain to the beautiful Companion to the surly thug figured out, they do something to throw a wrench in it and make you start over nearly from scratch.<br /><br />I know now that I largely missed out - not really on the episodes as I have the DVDs - but on the chance of doing my small part to keep it from getting cancelled.  However, thanks to the glory of the Internet and of DVD sales, we're soon to get a Firefly movie, 'Serenity', and perhaps, just perhaps, with some luck and a network executive with a spine, a reprise of the show.  Firefly deserves so much better than how it was treated, and the legions of loyal fans (cultish tendency to refer to one another as 'Browncoats' aside) are a testament to that.  If you get your hands on these DVDs, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This with out a chance one of the best of the year. The visuals are outstanding. Also you will find yourself laughing more than you thought you would, trust me.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|This review is not a critique of Universal's questionable DVD marketing strategies.  I only bought this summer's \\"Special Collector's 5th Anniversary Edition of the Last DVD Release\\" version of \\"Jaws\\" because... well, five years ago, I bought the 25th anniversary edition of \\"Jaws\\" on VHS. <br /> <br />*crickets chirp* <br /> <br />At any rate, having previously seen most of the specials features on this set courtesy of the electronic miracle of the video cassette player, I didn't spend a lot of time on the added extras.  I bought \\"Jaws\\" on DVD because it's \\"Jaws\\".  On DVD.  And I didn't have it before.  True, I'd have preferred some sort of text trivia track, or a cast and production crew commentary, even if Spielberg wasn't going to contribute.  Surely there were some audio interviews with Robert Shaw that could have been located and incorporated? <br /> <br />The movie itself remains one of my enduring favorites, even though I discovered it relatively late, through repeat airings on Turner basic cable in the mid to late '90s.  \\"Jaws\\" is atypical for a blockbuster in that the second half of the movie is basically a stage play with a cast of two scenery-chewing masters, a mechanical shark, and Roy Scheider.  Witness (several times) the nine-minute sequence set in the cabin of the Orca, which begins with Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw comparing scars... then transitions to Shaw's captivating speech about the U.S.S. Indianapolis (which he reportedly wrote himself)... followed by a slightly drunken sing-along... interrupted by a shark attack in mid-chorus.  Spielberg was only 26 when he filmed this, and it's easy to see why he stuck around. <br /> <br />The first half of the movie has almost no relation to the last, but even in different tempo, Spielberg captures the bucolic intensity of Amity Island with a master's attention to detail.  In any other film, Murray Hamilton would have stolen the show as the earnest, buffoonish, soon-to-be-deflated mayor who insists onkeeping the beach open even after two people are dead.  And even in the midst of the comic actions of the islanders, Spielberg still pushes Ben Gardner's disembodied head through a boat hull when the audience least expected it (and repeated the trick 20 years later with Samuel L. Jackson's arm in \\"Jurassic Park\\"). <br /> <br />While Lorraine Gary is given a bit of a thankless role, and drops out of the movie halfway through, it's amazing that she had time to make an impression at all, what with Shaw and Dreyfuss trying to outdo each other in every scene -- both successfully.  And even though the nominal hero, Roy Scheider, seems to be lagging 15 seconds behind Shaw and Dreyfuss (watch the cabin sequence again and see how passive he makes Chief Brody), he still saves the day when Shaw's working-class fisherman act and Dreyfuss's hi-tech gadgetry both fail to stop the great white. <br /> <br />It's great to see \\"Jaws\\" still kicking hard 30 years later, in the way that \\"War of the Worlds\\" probably won't do in 2035.  From the recent \\"MythBusters\\" special on \\"Jaws\\", which even took time to debunk the deleted scene with Shaw buying piano wire... to Bryan Singer's effortless rehabilitation of Scheider's nonsense line, \\"That's some bad hat, Harry\\", I would find myself watching \\"Jaws\\" on DVD even if the Special Edition had nothing on it but the movie. <br /> <br />Even so, put together that audio commentary so I can buy the Commemorative 5th Anniversary Edition of this current release in 2010.
B00074C4DA|5.0|Since nobody reviewed this version, and this is the actual version I have, I will review this one. First off let me just say this version with the bonus DVD is worth it if you live in some crap area where the Mars Volta does not come around to. You get a short glimpse into their live show, and it will make you cry that you aren't able to see them because you live in Alaska, or some other weirdo state. The album is perfect; that's really all I can say. I wish they would've kept it at 5 tracks, but you can't have everything. If you like early material by Yes, Mahavishnu Orchestra or even Santana, you will probably love this. Highly recommended.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I don't know. Most movies don't leave me in \\"Awe\\" when i'm finished watching them, but for some reason this movie did. The whole story i found very interesting, and the special effects were awesome. i'm not really fond of writing long reviews, i just think this movie is great and i highly reccommend it, and forget all the negative reviews their garbage, see Constantine and give it a chance before u judge it, u just might be suprised at how good it is.
B00005ASGG|5.0|\\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is without a doubt, one of John Wayne's best western films.  If you don't own this film, I highly recommend it.  It is fun watching over and over again as the script is solid and engaging, and the acting performances among the three principle stars is more than superb!<br /><br />\\"Vallance\\" is Oscar winning Director John Ford's last best effort in western film making.  He put together an all-star cast and the cast put out for Ford as well, with stunning performances from John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Lee Marvin.  Wayne's acting is Academy Award material.  He brings a depth of character to the Tom Doniphon role that will have you remembering his performance long after the film ends.  In one scene, a drunken and despondent Wayne returns to the home he has built for his future wife Hallie.  In a rage, he lights a lantern and sets fire to the new structure, with the intention of burning it, and himself, to the ground. The scene is riveting, and the expressions and movements of Wayne are some of the greatest ever filmed.<br /><br />Although John Wayne is the \\"star\\" of this film, the film in reality has three stars, Wayne, James Stewart, and Lee Marvin.  Jimmy Stewart plays Ransom Stoddard, an idealistic lawyer who comes to bring legal law to the west.  Stoddard is introducted to the west by none other than the terorist outlaw Liberty Valance, who robs the stage Stoddard is on.  When Stoddard tries to resist the robbery of an elderly fellow passenger, Valance, played by Lee Marvin savagely beats him with a whip, leaving him to die.  Wayne's character, Tom Doniphon, happens upon Stoddard and brings him to town.  This sets the stage for the rest of the movie, as Stoddard tries to bring Liberty Valance to justice.<br /><br />Lee Marvin's \\"Valance\\" is yet another superb acting performance. Whenever Marvin is on screen, there is tension and conflict, as Marvin plays the out of control Valance to the hilt. Marvin's acting rivals and matches those of Wayne and Stewart, making this a film that you will want to watch over and over again, for the acting performances alone.<br /><br />The film hosts a fine supporting cast.  Vera Miles very adequately plays Hallie, a young girl who has to decide upon the man she will spend the rest of her life with - Wayne or Stewart. Andy Devine provides comic relief as the bumbling overweight sheriff who avoids conflict any way he can.<br /><br />Although a bit old in real life for the roles they play, both Stewart and Wayne excel in their parts to such an extent that the ages of the actors are forgotten.  The plot is satisfying and in the end we finally learn who REALLY shot Liberty Valence, and what the death of Valance has on the lives of the characters.<br /><br />In my list of the best westerns of all-time, \\"Liberty Valance\\" is certainly in the top 10.  An added bonus is that this film can be viewed by the entire family; my boys especially have enjoyed the film.  You will not regret buying this DVD.<br /><br />Jim Konedog Koenignd matches those of Wayne and Stewart, making this a film that you will want to watch over and over again, for the acting performances alone.  <br /> <br />The film hosts a fine supporting cast.

1400032717|5.0|Finally, a book which shows, not tell :) <br /> <br />Reading through the book gives me a profoundly deep impression of a character srpinkled to life. Frankly, the autistic behaviour of Christopherr surely gets into my nerves, at times even irritating, but that's only because of how successfully the author has portrayed the character. Every twist inside his mind, every twitch of his actions, being slowly told through the book. I haven't felt so much for a character in my life. <br /> <br />This is surely five stars up for a book!
B00005JNSK|3.0|This a nice family movie both kids and adults can enjoy. Kids will really like it.I thought it was a nice movie I'm not raving about it though. If you are trying to cut candy and chocoalte out of your diet don't see this move, you will have massive cravings for it. And those songs are very catchy as well.
B00005JNSK|4.0|ok ive seen it twice already and the films really good...not as good as it could have been though...problems are this ~ the oompa loompas are annoying and ugly and their songs are pathetic...everytime a kid gets taken away they burst into horrible songs......next the relationship between charlie and willy wonka could have been more close...and i couldnt help but feel there was SOOOO much in that candy factory that we didnt get to see.....the Good stuff is that Johnny Depp is once again maginificent....u cant tell its him whatsoever and u can tell he relished the part...the costume was awesome.....danny elfmans score is flawless...loved it..particularly the main title sequence..its kind of creepy....the usual tim burton dark glossy look is abundant throughout, particularly the seen with the chocolate river and green grass...beautful sets.....however the film was a little slow at times...could have used more \\"magical\\" feel to it ya know....but im satisfied..good job!
B000062YAZ|5.0|A bunch of noise, all sound the same??? <br />The ppl that say this can only wish to match the musicianship of this quartet.  As veteran guitaris and thrash fan, I can attest that this stuff is challenging to play.   <br />Problem w/ lyrics??? <br />Lotta these ppl are \\"Christian Metalheads\\" or angry jews.  \\"Angel of Death\\" is not gloryfying the holocaust, it is simply a song about its brutality.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is, in short, a movie you must see. <br />Where to start? Well, it has a great cast, direction, plot, genre... it does not have any faults. But this alone is not what makes it a great movie. Most movies today are ideas done a thousand times over, and re-hashed with new actors, but Sin City stands apart. <br />It's use of colour to create drama, the cinematography, the sheer style is a nice break from the usual run of big guns, big explosions and loads of special effects action genre, of course there is a healthy dose of that too, but it really takes a back seat to the story, and how it is delivered. <br />To finish up, if you even REMOTELY like movies that have cool plot twists, violence and take you on a slick thrill ride, watch this movie. now. Get off the PC and get a ticket. Do it!
0345347951|5.0|This book is extremely good, and extremely short, I think something like 150 pages.  Its extremely memorable, and easily read.  It gives both hope for humanity and is sometimes depressing. I like its religious undertones as well as utopian ideas.  Very good, should be a mandatory read.
B000063CPL|4.0|Wow, it is great to have Bruce back in the band. The Blaze Bayley albums (X-Factor and Virtual Xi) were somewhat depressing, although in my opinion, still a step up from \\"Fear of the Dark\\" and \\"No Prayer for the Dying.\\" With Bruce and Adrian rejoining the band, the band is capable of playing at a more genuine, vintage pace and timbre. \\"Rock in Rio\\" is a return, to some degree, of the olden days (though this album is a far cry from \\"Live After Death\\").    On the plus side, it is a treat to hear Bruce singing the Bayley songs \\"Clansman\\" and \\"Sign of the Cross.\\" Both are played exceptionally well and Bruce actually adds to the songs what Bayley lacked. In fact, even the crowd makes \\"The Clansman\\" much more entertaining -- you can almost picture William Wallace with his sword aloft as he charges the field of Bannockburn yelling \\"Freedom!!!\\" Gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.    On the down side, IM doesn't need a third guitarist. Why are they still clinging to Jannick Gers? From a guitar-player's standpoint, he tremolo picks every solo (that is, he picks the string as fast as he can, whether it's in time with the song or not), and his fret-work is sloppy. Is he drunk in concert? He doesn't have this problem on the studio albums, and the songs that he writes are decent. When he plays live, he stinks. His on-stage antics are unbearable. I laughed out loud when I saw him strumming his guitar windmill-style during \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" on the DVD version of this album. Janick, leave the windmilling to Pete Townsend! And if you think about it, he looks and acts a lot like Ritchie Blackmore (Deep Purple) did while playing live. The guitar-spinning, hoisting, knelt-down poses and wannabe 80s hair-band style of guitar playing is CHEESY! Janick is a good guitarist (although Murray and Smith are better, IMO)---he should just stick to playing guitar and stop the show-boating. It's embarrassing.    Another point -- if you've got Adrian Smith back, then play some of his stuff! We haven't heard \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" (one of his best compositions) in nearly 20 years, and \\"Wasted Years\\" (a crowd favorite) is all but gone. \\"Infinite Dreams\\" was another great song that featured Adrian that is played no more. This was understandable while Smith was gone. But now that he's back, they need to exploit his abilities like the used to.    Another problem (to me) is the crowd. Sometimes, as I stated above for the song \\"The Clansman,\\" they are helpful, but most of the time they are too loud and quite often they come across as annoying. I know IM's biggest fan base is in Brazil, but sometimes they sing along with the guitar melody (\\"The Evil that Men Do\\" for instance) or sing over and on top of Bruce (most songs) at very high volume. I don't blame the crowd per se, but perhaps I blame the sound mixing. Either way, it does get in the way of the music, so if you're new to IM, you may want to pick up the studio releases to supplement this CD so that you can understand better what is being played/sung.    My biggest hang-up, as a bassist myself, is Steve Harris' (lack of) presence on this album. I have to strain in order to hear his bass-playing, which shouldn't be the case with IM. He just sounds quiet to me, whereas even in the studio recording of \\"Brave New World,\\" (from which the majority of the songs on this CD were chosen) Steve's presence is unmistakable.    All in all, this is a pretty good set of songs (even the vintage \\"Sanctuary\\" makes a come-back!) and it is played well. I would pick it up, along with \\"Live After Death\\" as essential live recordings of IM.
B00005JNJT|4.0|This is a different Batman alright, it's definatly darker. Christian Bale makes a good Batman as well. Not enough Scarecrow though. From the trailers I thought this would be Batman vs. Scarecrow, it's not theres about three vilians in the movie. Scarecrow is cool vilian I like the gas as a weapon and how the screen got all distorted when he used it and how is voice sounded when he put on the mask. His first appearence on screen kind of creeped me out. All in all this look like the begining of a good new franchise.
B00000055E|5.0|2pac is the most lyrical and heartful rapper i have ever listen to. They have Amaru Records still going strong with 8 released 2pac cds since his death. This one is another classic with my favorite songs like \\"Open fire\\",R U Still Down (Remember Me), \\"Hellrazor\\", \\"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto\\", and \\"Definition of A Thug N***\\". Well, im gonna stop boring the crap out of you all. This just shows you how good and kick ass this cd is. In my opinion if ya want a 2pac cd that has come out after his death this and the 7 day theory is the ones you want, peace out. RIP 2pac Amaru Shakur.
0201485672|5.0|Of all the great books on language neutral programming/design, I'd have to rate this book as second ONLY to Design Patterns.  After reading a few of Martin Fowler's other very good book, I'd also have to also say that he really hit the mark on this one.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|I can take the fact that it's not faithful to the comic, no comic book movie really is  (With the exception of Sin City) but when the movie is done this badly, you have to stand up and call it like it is. Not only does this disgrace the popular comic book with a screenplay so poorly written that it makes junior high school term papers seem more intelligent but it has possible the worse actor playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is not only miscast, he's down right dangerous to the movie because you don't believe for one minute that he is the character. Someone wrote that he looked like he was doing a Batman impersonation and I have to agree with that because the John Constantine of the comic book was never as grim as his performance. Not only that but the comic book character was fought his enemies with his wits than the gun Keanu brands in the movie plus he knew what he was doing, something Keanu's character seems like he never does. The story rips off several storylines from past issues of the comic book and does them no justice at all with how bad the screenplay is written.  Most of the performances are hit and miss with the exception of the performance of Rachel Weisz, who I agree with the majority who have written their views here and everywhere is excellent and deserves a much better movie than this. She gives way too much talent and class to this movie and does almost make you want to look pass its huge problems because of her effort but she's the only good thing that this movie has going for it while the rest of it almost bores you sleep with scenes that are paced too slowly and dialog that is flat out so stupid that you really can't believe on what you are hearing from some of the character's mouths from time to time. The creature effects look horrible and the world of hell loses its luster after the first time you see it. Some of the special effects are shot in the dark and you really can't see certain scenes from time to time.  I think the director was trying to give a kind of noir feel to the film but back out on what noir really means because he rather copy on what was done before than to come up with something truly original. <br /> <br />If you like to watch bad movies, then have yourself a good time, because the movie is that bad but if you looking for a good film that respects the comic book, this is not it.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNSK|3.0|This is a great movie but it is so weird. Don't get me wrong or anything but when Willy Wonka tals and does all that stuff he just says plain o WEIRD things.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|The Longest Yard is a pretty funny movie with Chris Rock and the football players being the funniest. The football game and the ending are almost identicle to the original but everything before that is new, I think. This is definatly worth checking out.
B000003TA4|4.0|There are a few great tracks off this! 4 of them are hits. Other <br />than 4, this is a week cd!! Buy it mostly for SLTS. NIRVANA ROCKS <br />THAT SONG ON THE RADIO!!
0201721481|5.0|Having owned the previous edition of this book, I've always felt that it was the best book for learning for beginners, and for gaining a higher understanding of the language for intermediate C++ programmers.  With the addition of another great author, I just had to get the new edition, and wasn't dissappointed.  Although I haven't read the new edition in it's entirety, I have used it on occasion for reference, in which case I can see improvements over the previous edition.  It's replaced my usage-warn copy of the previous edition very well.
0375815260|5.0|I read this book well before i ever heard of the original movie, and well before the second. This book captures imagination like no other, and the brilliant idea and the brilliant writing makes for an amazing book. This is one of my alltime favorite books, and authors. Roald Dahl also inspired the movie Matilda, and he also made other great books such as: James and the Giant Peach, and The Twits.  <br /> <br />Charlie and the Chocolate factory is about a boy who is living in a very small ' house ' with his Mom, Dad, 2 Grandpas, and 2 Grandmas. His dad has a very low paying job at a toothpaste factory which is very low pay. Soon, Willy Wonka puts 5 golden tickets in 5 chocolate bars. The winners have their own sense of uniqueness; which is not neccesarily good; and against all odds, Charlie becomes one of them. <br /> <br />The rest of the story you will have to find out yourself. Anyways, this is a very good original idea, short and to the point, and great for any age whatsoever. This book cover is also very nice to look at.
B0002XL35G|4.0|this film is just great. i didnt believe everything, thats true, but is awesome anyway. watch it.
B000059XUO|5.0|Great movie, good special effects without going overboard and especially great acting from the whole cast. Definately worth having in the collection and it's the best of the Crow series by far.
0393035158|5.0|The book brings to light IMO that reasonable voices must begin to be heard or the religious ones will undo us all.  As an AA it is really troubling to witness the \\"jedi mind trick\\" being played on us in some of our religious institutions.  This is a free country why is it so hard to criticize religion?
0201633612|5.0|I've read dozens of very good computer books over the years, both language specific, and language neutral.  I'd have to rate this as one of the best, if not THE best book I've ever read in the CS field.  A must for anyone working with any of the object oriented languages.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Of all the bands out today, I'd have to say that one of the most deserving is definitely SOAD. They get lampooned by people for their success or by some because those people don't understand them. Or the political difference. But not even that characteristic is as omnipresent in these songs as you may be convinced. It's more the self-titled sound than one in \\"Toxicity\\", and on here, the band prove to make even more great music. None of the material sounds that forced. When they stray from metal, it doesn't seem like they're holding back at all, just being natural. They even use accordions! Those are two of the album's greatest songs: \\"Radio/Video\\" and \\"Old School Hollywood\\", the latter even beginning in vocoder! That track is like a real standout of the album, in its quirkiness and theme of an all-celeb baseball game. <br />Yeah, there's way more vocals from Daron this time around. Somewhat disappointing to me in that Serj is just an amazing vocalist, but I also really like it when bands have more than one vocalist. It's kind of what gives this half of the double album some character, is the varied instruments heard. \\"Cigaro\\" is a nice track with the chorus stacked over the verses, very quirky all thoughout, yet very catchy. \\"BYOB\\" shows the insane tempo changes in its politically charged track, from its thrash-inspired guitar intro to its dancy/catchy chorus, to operatic sounds and whatnot. I feel that the political lyrics in \\"Sad Statue\\" are a lot more poignant and better. There's also issues like the \\"Violent Pornography\\" which are spoken of here. After that, you hear acoustic, Latin-flavored guitar intro in \\"Question!\\". It's got a real hypnotic melody and is one of the greatest singles I've heard in awhile. The distortion kind of makes it more addicting. But one thing that makes the album, more than anything is that SOAD really gets the balance right on \\"Mezmerize\\". The songs do get real silly sometimes, though, which may be a turn-off, like the nonsensical \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\". I like it, but it's not really close to my ideal SOAD track, the worst on the disc. But in spite this disc's rather short length, it is rather satisfying in the end. The added elements are there for you to get used to. <br /> <br />More proof that people who stereotype them as typical nu-metal either need to clean their ears out or are just flat out snobs.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This is, easily, the best album ever. <br /> <br />When I say that, its important to take it context. My brother used to play me close to the edge almost every day back when i was 9 or 10 until i made myself like it. but eventually, i did start to like it, and when i did he got me this cd. I listened to it and was blown away. Absolutely blown away. Then, merely a few months later, I saw the band on their symphonic tour. I dont remember if I was even ten yet. I was so young. I was so excited. Yes was the band that got me into music. And I consider this to be their greatest album. <br /> <br />The live renditions of these songs simply destroy the originals. Siberian Khatru is a great opener, and it has a great new ending. Heart of the Sunrise sounds great. The jamming and drum solo on Perpetual Change ascend it from \\"amazing\\" to \\"godly\\". And You And I is heavier and rawer than the original. Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman deliver amazing solo performances. Roundabout and Your Move/All Good People sound awesome. Long Distance Runaround/The Fish features a godly bass solo and some amazing jamming. This version of Close To The Edge has a slightly different climax. I consider it the greatest moment in rock music. The added jamming on Yours Is No Disgrace is so incredibly good i feel sick whenever i hear it. Starship Trooper is one of the bands classics. Its amazing here. <br /> <br />But nothing i can say about this album can do it justice. These are five of the most amazing rock musicians ever creating the most amazing music i have ever heard in my entire life. You are not a complete person until you buy this cd.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|They made such a big deal of this movie before it came out and in my opinion it definately didn't live up to that. It's good but not great and a few of the characters are annoying. This is worth watching and having in the collection.
B0001I562I|5.0|I remember going to the movies with my parents when it originally came out and I have loved it ever since. When I saw it on DVD I bought it and it quickly became a favorite of my children.
B0007IN318|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I intend to reread it.  Robert Harris did his research well and he really takes the reader back 79AD.  I studied Greek and Roman art history in university and I can find no error in his details which makes for very enjoyable reading.  He does a wonderful job describing the locale.  I also enjoyed the details on volcanology.  It fitted in very well with the plot.  I read the book in one sitting.  I simply couldn't put it down.  I particularly like the way he describes Pliny the Elder.  He must have been a wonderful man.
B0006L16N8|3.0|X&Y is an evolutionary effort, its not by any means revolutionary.  For one thing, the band has tried (but not entirely) cast away the \\"radiohead lite\\" label, they've developed their sound, its not very different, but its distinctively coldplay, for better or worse.  So its no Kid A, but for a band in the spotlight they didn't manage to sell out like other bands.. *cough* Dave Matthews *cough*.  X&Y might have been a great standalong album but compared to Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the head, it really doesn't stand out that much.  In the end, I expected more out of coldplay in terms of lyrics, (some of the songs are a bit painful to listen to because they're just THAT trite).  The band has been under alot of pressure to produce this album, and its hard to live up to such high expectations.  X&Y is still a decent album, just not great
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Honestly, I'd take train of thought over this. Where are the solos? Where are the sweet riffs? Never Enough and Panic Attack sound exactly the same. The first four tracks are just plain awful. What the hell is up with Root Of All Evil? Why is there so much James Labrie all the time?  <br /> <br />So far, I'd count this as the biggest dissapointment of 2005. But hardly anyone agrees....
B000002W9P|5.0|Helloween was one of the first metal bands I ever got into and I'm still a fan today. Great music and one of the best singers I've ever heard. If you're a fan of power metal or (real) metal in general this is definately worth it.

B000A5044C|5.0|Four stepsiblings (two boys and two girls) living in present day Tokyo, Japan are suddenly abandoned by their charismatic, yet irresponsibly idealistic mother.  Left with only a little money and a vague hope that their mother may return from her romantic escapades (hoping to find a father for her kids), the children struggle to survive on their own.<br /><br />  As unbelievable as the plot sounds, this film succeeds because it is surprisingly believable. The simple piano score, the raw, \\"documentary-style\\" of the film, and the slow, but precise pacing all compliment the memorable, realistic acting, especially from Yagira, playing the oldest boy.<br /><br />  Yagira's performance is touching and heartfelt without being \\"cute\\" (steven speilberg would be apalled). When the food and water run out, he does not waste time crying or throwing a tantrum. Instead, he tediously pumps water from the local playground pump and shamelessly bums leftover sushi from a restaurant for him and the others, all the while smiling from time to time, dreaming of baseball and school (which he has never attended).<br /><br />  Though they live day to day, looking more grungy and detatched from society,ironically, out of their harsh living, they acquire a compassion and vitality for life much stronger than that of most of their peers in the civilized world. Their newfound strength ultimately helps them to cope with an almost unthinkable tragedy that evokes scenes so powerfully simple that they are likely to remain in the viewer's mind long after the movie is over.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|It took me the better part of 2 hours to get rid of the copy protection software this cd installed on my computer.  If you buy this CD, make sure you disable autorun for your cd rom drive before inserting the cd, so that software never gets installed in the first place.

B0009KA7BS|3.0|This is a decent film with very good special effects, but the script was laughable at times. The white outfit that the devil wore had me confused as to whether he was a 'good guy' or not and Gabriel's tight outfit was better suited for a partygoer than for an angel. There were other things like the dialog, which seemed weak or corny at times and the fact that the film seemed to struggle with itself for an identity; was it a horror or a weak action film? I felt that the good elements of the film barely outweighed the bad hence my rating; however, I definitely wouldn't buy the DVD.
0778320448|5.0|This book I would recommend to everyone. The four are captivating and you won't want to miss a minute. They are by far one of the best friendship groups I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Lydia, who is a cancer survivor, takes a chance and opens her own knitting supply shop. She decides to start up a class to get things going. What she doesn't expect is the story. All four are classical type women from books, but the storyline is fab.<br /><br />I could guess what was going to happen, but didn't make me love the story any less. I am glad that I have the next book A Good Yarn, so I can continue the story today!
B0002HTZJI|5.0|OK maybe not, I guess DVD would be a little closer, but this is still a phenomenonal live album.  As stated in just about every other review, you can feel the energy, and if you close your eyes you can almost feel like you are apart of the show.  Me only complaints about the album are: <br />A) I wasn't there for the taping <br />B) The stupid stuff Anthony and Flea say in between songs.  No one cares if you like blueberries or not!  <br /> <br />I'm not going to give a detailed blow by blow of all the songs, just the highlights.  Any song I don't write about is still awesome, but no different that album versions or other commonly found live versions. <br /> <br />Intro- Pretty weak to be honest.  I've heard them do ALOT better intros.        <br />Can't Stop- Great beginning. <br />By the Way- I love how they end this song live. <br />Otherside- Always one of my favorite songs.  The solo is great.   <br />Easily- My all-time favorite Chili Pepper song.  The extended outro solo is intense.  Worth the price of the entire double album. <br />Brandy- Great version of the song.  The chorus is the best part. <br />Don't Forget Me- Great song all the way around.  John's vocals are tremendous. <br />Throw Away Your Television- The song itself is cool, but they end with a song they did for the second half of the By The Way tour.  I'm not sure, but I think it is called \\"Don't you ever leave.\\"  Lord this is great. <br />Leverage of Space- New song.  I dig a lot. <br />Purple Stain- Wish they did this one live more often. <br />Zephyr Song- Live version is better than the album.  The solo is again powerful.         <br />Californication-  Another great live song.  My favorite thing about them playing it live is that John makes up a new solo every time.  This one is so amazing, I rewind it like 10 times every time I listen to the album to hear it over and over again.          <br />Right on Time- Stick to The Clash into.         <br />Drum Homage Medley- Great way to come backfrom a break.  Chad is God on the Drums, which is why he's in the Guinness Book of World records.  MMMMMM Guinness.   <br />Under the Bridge- Same as always. <br />Black Cross- Low point of the album.         <br />Flea's Trumpet Treated by John- One word: WOW!         <br />Give It Away- Same as always, but great way to end a show. <br /> <br />This is an outstanding album from an outstanding band.  It is my belief that they are the best touring band around.  Seeing them live is the whole reason I got into them in the first place.  Buy this album.  A+++ <br />
B00064MW6K|4.0|Maybe I am being biased because I love Halle Berrys acting and of course her natural beauty.  This is Catwomen.   I don't know what people were expecting.  I thought Halle played the innocent clumsy girl role very well in portraying Patience Phillips in the begining of the movie and then shifting over to the more sexy catwomen role after she was resurrected from death by the cats.  I liked the basketball court scene when she plays B.Bratt one on one with all the kids screaming in the background.  She really looks sexy in that scene.  In my mind I think she is in the top 5 actresses out there today.  The women does have acting ability.  That is without question.   Its all in what you like I guess but I did not think this movie was to awfully bad.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|I wanted to like this album. I tried. But I have an idea that in 5 years, no one will remember this record. It reaks of Sufjan Stevens trying to be different. Like the guy at the coffee shop who wears the wool cap and army coat, when it is 100 degrees outside. Like his bio on his web site about being found in a milk crate. Like the horrible long titles of the songs. But most importantly, like the music that just does not grab you. You won't be humming any of these tunes at work.  <br />It is not horrible. Just not that great. Don't believe the hype surrounding this album. I would say sample some of the songs. They all sound pretty much alike.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Having grown up on Batman (89) and its sequels, this sudden retelling of the Batman saga took me by surprise.  Did this imply viewers to forget the first four movies, that this was THE definitive Batman story?  Or was this an alternate reality separate from the previous movies.<br /><br />What separates this from the previous Batman canon is that it explores the why's and when's of Bruce Wayne as a child, something that was gone over superficially in the 1989 Batman.  We see Wayne falling down a well and terrified by a cloud of bats that fly at him.  Then there's the oft-told tale of how his parents were gunned down by a criminal.  And the big payoff is of course, whence came Batman?<br /><br />His jiujistu and ninja training by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) of the League of Shadows, a group dedicated to a vigilante-style justice, explains how he not only hones his skills, but also how he confronts his fear.  And he decides to put fear unto baddies by the very thing he feared most.  But the Legion is more a crusader for justice in an extreme way.  Using Rome and Constantinople as examples, the Legion have been behind-the-scene catalysts for change in decadent empires, paving the way for the Germanic peoples and Ottoman Turks respectively.  It's Gotham's turn, reminding me of the words of Jack Nicholson's Joker, \\"this town needs an enema.\\"  Yet despite his brooding and anger, Wayne still believes in the justice system, which sets him at odds against Ducard.<br /><br />Back in Gotham, Wayne is welcomed back to Wayne Industries, led by corporate shark Earle (Rutger Hauer), where he befriends Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), head of the high-tech division, which translates to exile from the board room so he can't cause trouble.  Seems that his division has a lot of stuff the military didn't want to use, such as certain bulletproof body armour, grapple hook, a lightweight parachute-like fabric, and a humvee-type vehicle originally for bridge purposes.  Wayne's deadpan question:  \\"Do you have any of these in black?\\"  He sets out to undermine Carmine Falcone, the gangster behind the racketeering and drugs in Gotham City, yet there are other players, such as Dr. Crane, head of Arkham Asylum, whose duty is to pronounce Falcone's thugs insane so they can't be found guilty.  And Batman is dead set on protecting Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), his childhood friend, now an idealistic assistant at the DA's office who's fighting a lonely crusade against corruption.<br /><br />Where the previous Batman films featured a Dark Knight already at the peak of his powers, this shows Batman in the making.  He makes a clumsy attempt at escaping when first making contact with Sgt Gordon, the only honest cop in Gotham, crashing into all sorts of things in the process.  And where Tim Burton made his Gotham City a dark and gothic place, Christopher Nolan's Gotham retains the same murkiness, but with a more glossy high-tech covering.  And certain hazy scenes play havoc with the usual deadeningly fast action sequences.<br /><br />Batman here is defined as a vigilante, which draws comparisons to Paul Kersey in Death Wish and the idealistic cops in Magnum Force.  The latter case was motivated for personal revenge, while the second was against corrupt criminals who got off scotfree.  In his belief in universal justice as opposed to parochial revenge, his role as champion and hero puts him higher than the aforementioned vigilantes.

And yes, the ending more than hints at a sequel.yne's deadpan question:  \\"Do you have any of these in black?\\"  He sets out to undermine Carmine Falcone, the gangster behind the racketeering and drugs in Gotham City, yet there are other players, such as Dr. Crane, head of Arkham Asylum, whose duty is to pronounce Falcone's thugs insane so they can't be found guilty.  And Batman is dead set on protecting Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), his childhood friend, now an idealistic assistant at the DA's office who's fighting a lonely crusade against corruption. <br /> <br />Where the previous Batman films featured a Dark Knight already at the peak of his powers, this shows Batman in the making.  He makes a clumsy attempt at escaping when first making contact with Sgt Gordon, the only honest cop in Gotham, crashing into all sorts of things in the process.  And where Tim Burton made his Gotham City a dark and gothic place, Christopher Nolan's Gotham retains the same murkiness, but with a more glossy high-tech covering.  And certain hazy scenes play havoc with the usual deadeningly fast action sequences. <br /> <br />Batman here is defined as a vigilante, which draws comparisons to Paul Kersey in Death Wish and the idealistic cops in Magnum Force.

B0002858YS|5.0|this album is absolutely phenomenal. i have had hot fuss for about a year and i still listen to it about 5 times a day. the songs just never get old. very 80s new wave music that is absolutely awesome. my favorite songs are mr. brightside, somebody told me, midnight show, and andy you're a star but every song on the album is tremendous. i saw the killers in concert w/louis xiv a month ago and they are better live. absolutely phenomenal band and album. also anyone who reads \\"rock god\\"s review of this album keep in mind that he gave mtv-dwelling papa stupid no-talent roach five stars.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I`d say, who can live with \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" will be able to do with this one. Much more melodic as their previous records, if not to say soft, but still progressive. Less metal, more ambiental sounds, less virtuosity, more sense for harmonies, less Pantera, more Pink Floyd. Actually a good thing, because who would want to listen to his favourite band, if every record sounds (nearly) the same. I am sure, they will be back with a more heavier and virtous record soon enough. <br />I just wonder, if anyone else noted the influences of sounds of other bands - not that it is something new, there were always connotations of Led Zep, Pink Floyd, Metallica, Pantera, Marillion in DT`s sound, but in an obvious way and on purpose. This time I noted, that DT was obviously listening to a lot of MUSE lately and it seems they kind of \\"digged\\" this very fine band's unique sound. Just listen to Panic Attack`s Chorus sung by James LaBrie, The Intro to Never Enough and harmonious symphonical/classical parts of Sacrificed Sons. Ok, it still sounds cool, but I think DT don`t necessarily have to \\"copy\\" someone. That for, they are playing in their \\"own league\\". <br />

0553573403|5.0|Where can I start?  Martin offers the richest fantasy world since Tolkien.  Books 1-3 of this series blew my mind.  Martin elevates fantansy to the next level.  These books are filled with tales of swords, sorcery, and slave-girls.  However, categorization of The Song of Ice and Fire is truely unjust.  Martin has moved beyond the ordinary, and moved into a realm of writers inhabited by Asimov, Zelazny, Clavell, and more...  I eagerly await the next installment.
B00004RD54|5.0|\\"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\\" is the second-best live rock LP of all time (right behind Warren Zevon's \\"Learning to Flinch\\").  Oddly, the addition of bonus tracks on this reissue detracts from, rathers than adds to, the album. Leave them off when you transfer the CD to your iPod.
B0000060NF|5.0|Considered by many to be Marvin Gaye's magnum opus, `What's going on' sounds like a continuous breezy jam session, filled with layered ethereal vocals, lush strings, flutes, horns, smatterings of hand percussion (bongos and conga especially), and lyrics dealing with war, peace, the environment, drugs, God. Radically different from soul music of it's day and very uncommercial, it's no surprise Motown boss Berry Gordy initially balked at its release.<br /><br />The album however, went on to exceed all expectations; no.6 on the billboard 200 albums chart, and 3 hot 100 top 10 singles; `What's going on' #2, `Mercy mercy me' #4 and `Inner city blues (makes me wanna holler)' #9,  and opened the doors for other soul artists like Stevie Wonder to break free from the shackles of commercial music and experiment.<br /><br />Opening track is the awesome `What's going on' questioning our prejudice for anyone different, as well as preaching love as the answer, not war.<br /><br />This segues easily into `What's happening brother' featuring angelic sounding backing vocals and jazzy singing from Marvin. Another call for peace, something in short supply these days.<br /><br />`Flying high in the friendly sky' is a gentle, even jazzier piece, which flows into the half spoken/half sung `Save the children', which flows into `God is love', a sunny religious song which showcases Marvin's vocal layering to good effect.<br /><br />`Mercy mercy me (the ecology project)' is similar in feel to `What's going on', but with lyrics about conservation and nature. Amazing.<br /><br />The old school soul of `Right on' flows right into another half spoken, lush, flourishing number `Wholy holy' which features no drumming.<br /><br />`Inner city blues (makes me wanna holler)' is the last track, a tender lament which flows back into `What's going on' in its closing moments.<br /><br />All in all, an album with a strong concept, a different kind of love from what the world was used to hearing Marvin sing about. A classic which stands the test of time, and still an inspiration for a lot of the music coming out today.<br /><br />What's going on? Still a question we are asking today brother Marvin...spiration for a lot of the music coming out today.     What's going on? Still a question we are asking today brother Marvin...
B000002G7G|5.0|This album may be even more enjoyable than the first VU album. \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Jesus\\" are very soft and mellow, and \\"I'm Set Free\\" will take you to another world. That song truly gets to all of your senses. The emotions on that track are overpowering. The closer, \\"After Hours,\\" is adorable and sounds like it could've been a 40s big band or 50s rock 'n' roll song. This album doesn't \\"rock\\" as much as the first VU release, but this one is more contemplative. I suggest that everyone interested in classic rock purchase this album, as well as \\"The Velvet Underground & Nico,\\" which is being sold at a very cheap price on Amazon.com!
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Where to start... Borrowing this set from a friend, I was skeptical, I had seen a trailer for Serenity, which looked like a bad, low budget Sci-Fi channel made for TV movie. Reading more about Serenity - it looks like it is just a push for DVD sales, though I believe they saved tons of money by using tv budget effects and actors.  <br /> <br />Easily the worst part of the show is the dialogue. Or wait, is it the actors? Or the mind numbing canned music? Or the painful intro song? Hard to choose. I'll say the dialogue since the last thing we need is a boring buffy western sci fi drenched in wittiness. Yes, everybody is very witty in this crew. You'll be up to your ears in wit, one-liners and creative sci-fi, techie speak. It was embarassing to watch. There was even an attempt at a western bar fight. So painful I had to skip to the next chapter. Even more lame were the \\"bad guys\\". Ouch. <br /> <br />Then you're left with mediocre sci-fi, uninteresting characters and the most boring leading man in television history. One plus, a companion on the ship is one of the loveliest women you will ever see. Almost worth watching just for her. <br /> <br />Most if not all of the plots will be familiar to any watcher of the A-Team, Sliders, Stargate SG-1, The Lost World, Lost in Space, etc.

B00005T30L|5.0|'Ghost World' is a hilarious film about two high school graduates on their summer vacation. Both of them are outcasts who enjoy making fun of the rest of society. One day a bored Enid and Rebecca decide to play a prank by responding to a love connections ad placed in the paper by a lonely 40 something year-old man. They leave a fake message on his machine pretending to be the woman he is searching for in the ad, telling him to meet them at a restaurant. There they wait for him and watch him, pathetically feeling sorry for him. When he leaves they follow him to his apartment. A few days later they meet him again at his garage sale. Enid borrows one of his old blues records and starts to develop a friendship with him. From there everything goes down in a whirlwind. Seymour (the 40 year-old man) and Enid develop an odd relationship that sort of surprises the viewer and the movie ends without anything resolving or coming to a solution. 'Ghost World' is pretty funny yet at the same time manages to be realistic. I think any young person can relate to it if they've ever felt like they have no idea where they are going in their life. Highly recommended.
B000002AEN|5.0|Mississippi John Hurt`s 1928 Okeh recordings is the sound of something beyond time known. The man and his blues gitar rides along over trails of sparkling dust and ancient dreams. There is so little Accomplishment involved here, so little Gaining; there is just pure joy on tape; effortless, streaming virtuosity. And something more than virtuosity as well, a lot more; the music is the unbound river of a free soul, not captured by self-improving boundaries, not bragging, not craving, not seeking.    My favourite tracks are Ain`t no Tellin & Louis Collins. They are morbidly funny pick-alongs with a delightful flow of natural musical expression. Featuring also legendary songs like Candy Man, Stagger Lee, Avalon, Frankie & Nobody`s Dirty business, this disc is some pearl deep down in the blue ocean of the blues.
B00069FLC2|5.0|Just got done viewing 'Shadows - The Final Tour' and i must say they were at their best...the concert show was flawless. I am from the United States and when The Shadows started out in the late 50's, i did not get much of their music, as here, they were pushing The Ventures which is a great instrumental group in their own right, but when i was able to purchase my first recording for The Shadows titled 'Wonderful Land', i was hooked from that day on...after buying my second 45 of theirs here in the states titled 'Guitar Tango' i knew from then that no band would come close to them. It was so hard to get their songs here, that i would have to order imports of their songs...finally after about 40 plus years, the U.S. finally discoverd them..but, they were not new to me, for i followed their music and careers since the late 50's.  There is no greater guitar player in my books than Hank B. Marvin..they have such a unique sound that it gives chills to my body, and when a song does that...it has a lot going for it, for i am very particular in my music...once again, this DVD of the Shadows is 'THE BEST' ...if no one has ever heard of this fantastic rock instrumental band, i would highly recommend this title...more than a 5 star rating from me for this group of talented musicians.

6305263248|5.0|This is a great action film from John Frankenheimer. The car chases are without a doubt some of the wildest ever filmed. Frankenheimer was well awear that computer generated images was all the rage, but went for the REAL thing!, and does he deliver. <br />The other thing I like about this DVD is that is double sided playing(you have the standard TV view and also the wide screen view on the flip side) This makes such good since that all movie companies should release their films on DVD this way. If you don't mind the occasional use of the \\"F\\" word then I suggest you get this DVD and set back and enjoy!!
B00005JNSK|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the second time Tim Burton approaches Roald Dahl's creations, but it is his first time as a director.  Despite being the first time, as a director, there is something strikingly similar between Burton and Dahl if one looks away from the fact that one is a filmmaker and the other an author, and it is their unique way of telling a tale.  Dahl's many stories are mysterious, clever, and have valuable lessons, as do Burton's films.  Both storytellers convey moral lessons for any individual regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity.  This time Burton directs Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the full approval of Felicity, Dahl's widow, and he captures the same puzzling world that Dahl once created through a grand adventure containing sweets and moral lessons.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore plays the main character, Charlie Bucket, a boy from a poverty stricken family where the parents nurture all four bedridden grandparents.  Charlie is polite, honorable, and noble, qualities that he most likely has acquired from his loving parents and guiding grandparents.  Nothing seems to touch the family, as they always see the glass as half full.  The Bucket family recognizes that money, possessions, and power do not grant them happiness.  The only thing that makes them truly happy is the love that they have for each other. It is announced to the world that Willy Wonka, the refined and enigmatic chocolatier, will invite five children that find five golden tickets to his factory.  These golden tickets can be found in his chocolate bars and they will provide entrance to his secretive chocolate factory to which no human has entered for years.  When Charlie hears about this he cannot help but dream of entering the factory up the street, and his birthday is just around the corner, which means that he will get a Wonka chocolate bar.<br /><br />In the meantime, Charlie and the folks in the small and raggedy Bucket residence will learn about who and how others have gained access to Wonka's chocolate factory.  Each of the lucky ticket winners brings up different notions of disrespectfulness, which further seems to stem from the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth.  These children are obvious in their character, as they might overtly express two or three of the deadly sins.  However, a younger audience will most likely not recognize the seven deadly sins, but it is nonetheless clear that these ticket winners are rude and have very bad manners.  The film even goes as far as openly suggesting the source, poor parenting.<br /><br />After an extensive introduction of the other characters, which is essential, as the film deals with what is right and wrong in the light of the consequences of being good, or bad, comes the biggest surprise, or maybe not as Charlie discovers the fifth and final ticket.  Together with Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) Charlie gladly leads into the legendary chocolate factory, as the other four children walk ahead of their parents into an adventure that will separate the good from the bad.  It is here, a good chunk into the film, where Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appears for the first time.<br /><br />Willy Wonka displays an overtly bizarre appearance with a large white smile and eccentric mannerisms that continue throughout the film.  Depp does an extraordinary job in bringing out an aloof and awkward character that frequently seems to drift off to some unknown time and place while standing among his newly arrived guests.  Those viewers who have seen Depp in other films will not identify this character from any of his previous performances.  It is also clear that Burton and Depp have a special relationship, as this is their fourth film and soon the public can see their fifth upcoming puppet film, Corpse Bride (2005).  Depp simply elevates the story far beyond mediocrity into the bizarre fantasy world where Burton seems to be most comfortable where the audience can relinquish it's thoughts completely to the filmmakers performances and storytelling.<br /><br />In 1971 Mel Stuart made Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory based on the same book, which for many has gained a status close to immortality in the world of cinema history.  Despite the notion of remaking an already good film, Burton forcefully delivers his version of the story with the help of a tremendous cast and spectacular cinematography that delivers a fantastic tale.  The film succeeds in reaching the level of the previous film from 1971 and with ease passes the former film based on Dahl's story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  This film should certainly gain a nod in the Oscars for the best writing and screenplay based on material previously produced or published.  Burton's film grasps the issues in an easily understandable manner which can be understood by both young and old, which does not leave anyone behind.  Yet, Burton leaves a little extra for the adult audience to ponder while also considering the youth by offering them several thoughtful lessons.  In the end, Burton's film delivers a tale that Dahl would have approved of, as it has all the genuine tangibles of both storytellers.ce can relinquish it's thoughts completely to the filmmakers performances and storytelling. <br /> <br />In 1971 Mel Stuart made Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory based on the same book, which for many has gained a status close to immortality in the world of cinema history.

B0007Y08IS|1.0|Parker and Stone should be banned from Hollywood after this piece of garbage.  Total waste of time.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I saw this when i first came out.There was so much that could have been done comedically with the premise of this,without stooping to lowbrow slapstick (though that has it's place too). The same story could have been told in America. I thought the setting of Tokyo was,with a couple of exceptions,wasted.<br /><br />  I found it very difficult to get to the ending,,and I'm perfectly capable of getting through a movie where stuff doesn't get \\"blowed up real good\\" every two minutes.<br /><br />  But,i've always been one to make myself sit through a movie, and I'm still glad I sat through it, because my prediction of \\"we're going to see a lot more of Scarlet Johansen\\" appears to be coming true.
B00002Z88D|3.0|All in all, this is a pretty bland album.  For one thing, there are too many newer (i.e., blander, not as good) songs on this album, rather than the old Metallica stuff.  For another, the mix of Metallica and the orchestra prevents the band itself from being loud and \\"metal\\" enough to properly offset the orchestral sounds.<br /><br />The singing by Hetfield is just OK, too.  His voice doesn't sound as good on these songs -- not enough angst, roughness in his sound.<br /><br />Again, it's just a bland album.  I listened to it a few times, but never got into it.  I ended up giving it to the local library so others can listen to it if they want.<br /><br />It could have been a great concept, and it probably sounded great in person, but on CD it's not anything to get excited about.

B0002VEPRQ|4.0|I first saw this film in the theater, on it's premiere.  If I'm not mistaken, it was a very early multiplex in Los Angeles.  Of course I was captivated.  I saw it again, over the years, on T.V., \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" style, with commercials, although the ads never seemed to attach themselves to film the way they did with the \\"Wizard\\", where I can still identify the scenes where the commercials are due.   <br /> <br />Then, as I grew up, and older, I aquired a more jaded view of \\"Mary Poppins\\", and ignored it for more than a decade.  And, fairly recently, I happened upon \\"Mary Poppins\\" on T.V., and realized that my memories were not accurate.   <br />It was not the repulsive '60s musical, ala \\"Sound Of Music\\", with the obnoxiously blonde, dreadfully perfect, aryan, children; but a wonderfully escapist piece, with bytes of subversiveness, referring to suffragettes, and a woman's place in Edwardian society, and what they were doing about it;  a subversiveness that \\"SOM\\" completely lacked, even with it's much darker Nazi overtones.  Can I strangle those brats with the drapes, now? <br /> <br />But lately, in watching the film, I notice that Cherry Tree Lane was all too awfully, a harbinger of the banal suburban housing tracts that dominate our lost farmlands and suburban sprawl, today.  One can see the imprimatur of Disneyland, and Disneyland Culture, all over this film, except that, when it debuted, this clarion call was not a part of the film that any, but the most clear headed, and most strident activists would have picked up.   <br /> <br /> <br />Oh my. <br /> <br />But don't let that deter you, this is a wonderful film.  This is a product from an era when Disney was a film maker, and not the metaphor of all that went wrong with American society.  It was, after all,  our fellow Americans that took the message to heart, and made a mess out of it.  Don't let them screw it up for you. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film for escapist entertainment, and I won't even feeda pidgeon, even in the company of children! (They're wild animals, like the Parrots of Telegraph Hill, and Chicago...) <br /> <br />This is a fine film.  Watch it.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead combines British humor with zombie gore, as a slacker goes on with his routine of a life, unknowing that the entire world is being taken over by walking dead.... <br /> <br />Shauns [Simon Pegg] life is so routine he nearly sleepwalks to the nearest grocery store in the morning, not knowing that there are just a few odd people stumbling and moaning after him. Thats just one of the things that make \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" so funny, these guys don't have a clue as to whats going on. <br /> <br />When Shaun and his friend Ed [Nick Frost] realize that everyone is running for their lives they do the only thing they know that can save them; Take out the bad music records in their collection of records and use them as frisbees to fend off the walking dead. <br /> <br />What makes this brilliant is that even though they want to survive, Shaun just cant seem to want to part with his favorite records. But everyonce in a while he manages to part with one, \\"The Batman soundtrack? Chuck it....\\" <br /> <br /> When they realize that the frisbee idea might not work they resort to getting down and dirty with a shovel and a cricket bat as clubs. <br /> <br />The acting and humor in \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is very entertaining and even sincere in some places. Anyone who's seen it should notice how dark the movie gets in the last half hour, going from fun, suspensful times as the people who are still alive are running away from the zombies, to, \\"You know, they just might not make it...\\" <br /> <br />Not only does Shaun have to survive zombies, he also has to get his girlfriend to forgive him for not turning his life around, and also has to look out for his mother, who's husband just happened to have been bitten by a zombie. So many twists and funy moments, too many to name... <br /> <br />One of them though that needs mentioning is how Ed and Shaun go over in their minds on who to save and where to go as long as they know where the exits are and where they can smoke. The answer? The winchester pub that they always go to, and ironically the place where Shaun's girlfriend despises to go. <br /> <br />That is just some of the things that you can expect from \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" A bunch of slackers actually thinking on their feet for a change, running around in a room mate's car that they stole after the room mate turns into a zombie himself, to impersonating chimpanzees in the Winchester pub. <br /> <br />I definately reccomend this movie if anyone wants a good laugh....
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have always loved Mariah's music from the very pop beginning. I think she keeps getting better with each and every album. Each album is different and I really love the turn towards R&B hip-hop. She'll always be an amazing ballad singer, but Mariah can rock with the very best R&B hip-hop artists. This album is smoking and utterly sensual! Every track is laden with heavy R&B hip-hop beats and beautiful lyrics. \\"We Belong Together\\" is just pure seductive listening. \\"To The Floor\\" with Nelly and \\"Get Your Number\\" with Jermaine Dupri and \\"Say Somethin'\\" with Snoop Dog will shake your booty. \\"Mine Again\\" is an incredible ballad. Bravo Mariah! A incredible comeback indeed.
0736041850|5.0|As a person who is interested in strength training, and with an emphasis on wanting to accomplish my goals in a correct and systematic way, I found this book to be most informative.  The diagrams showing the exact muscle groups that would be effected for each exercise were great.  I particularly liked the explanation of each exercise with instruction on how to correctly perform each movement.  I found this very useful since I want to not only be successful in my efforts, but I want also to avoid injury that would interrupt these efforts.
6305558167|2.0|I have admired this film since it came out in 1981 and under normal circumstances would give it a four or five star rating. However, unfortunately the DVD issued this year is not in the correct widescreen format.  It appears to have been made by matting a \\"pan and scan\\" TV master tape.  I wrote the distributor on this and they simply indicated that I could return it for credit.  If you want to see the film in its original full widescreen format you should check out the laser disc.  Hopefully, eventually Warners will release a correctly formatted dvd.

630460288X|1.0|this is the worst movie ive ever seen...the plot is ridiculous...i think the scene that sums up this movie is when stalone goes in the sewer finds a group of people living there and low and behold he happens upon a spanish woman grilling hotdogs and hamburgers and he promptly orders a burger and beer and she asks what hes paying with in spanish of course...then they cut to a horribly ugly watch bullock is wearing and he says hell pay with that so he gets this burger and beer and guess what? ooo whoa ho its actually made of rats ... that was a kneeslapper and than stalone adds the witty quip \\"oh not bad!\\" which made me want to drown myself...whats even better is that 2 minutes later he happens upon a 1970 muscle car in perfect condition i mean that would make sense that a muscle car from 1970 would be in a sewer in 2032 and in perfect condition among a group of sewer dwellers...and on that i think im gonna fill up my bath tub with some good ol'water to drown myself after watching this movie
B00005JMYI|1.0|Will is not funny at all in this movie. he was so gay in <br />this movie I couldn't watch the rest. Will as a matter of fact <br />isn't funny. ADAM SANDLER is funnier than Will. <br />Will thinks he is funny but he is so F*ckin lame. <br />Don't buy or rent this lame DVD. 5 Thumbs down Will.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I am a real fan of the books and, up until this one, the movies.  The Good points...the acting from the main three still seem to impress, as well as the darker feel the the whole Potter world.  The main problem with this film is how Cuaron failed to tell a complete story.  When you watch a movie you want to be able to watch it and understand everything thats going on in the film, this is where the movie lacks.  The viewer is required to have read the book in order to understand many of the plot points, many people gloss over this fact due to their love of the boy wizard.  This was made clear to me as i watched the DVD with some non book reading Potter fans and was forced to pause and explain what had happened leading up to (pick a point in the film).  This didn't happen once but approx 10-12 times making it feel like much of the film was only fan service.  While this problem alone in many fans eyes is ok because many of them HAVE read the book, one should not be forced to have the book present in order to understand the film....sorry Potter Fans there is just no way this movie stacks up to the previous films
B000957O82|3.0|Will Smith was ok in this average movie. <br />I would rent it unless you really want to buy it go for it. <br />g2g for all you Will smith fans. <br /> <br />P.S Will Smith's best movie was I,Robot
B000784WMW|5.0|I've loved this book forever and even named my daughter Jane! This 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark was faithful to the book in every way.  The music between installments is haunting and lasting to this day! I guess it must be Timothy Dalton's perfect diction and his command of the script that intrigued me, and Zelah Clark's emotions were perfectly portrayed. Their chemistry and timing are great. I suffered with Jane at all the twists and turns of this story.    All the other versions pale by comparison, with perhaps the exception of the Orson Wells-Joan Fontaine version which I collected from The Movie Channel.  Orson Wells was too dark and Miss Fontaine did the best she could opposite his genius. The movie was very short for that time and still conveyed the unfortunate tragedy of the circumstances.    The British are faithful to the story. Thornfield Hall was properly overwhelming and gloomy but the dialogue between Jane and Rochester is incomparable.  I cherish each and every scene they have together.  This is the grist from which love stories are made.
1401206905|5.0|\\"Batman:  Year One\\" is a description of how the Batman came to be.  The story also follows closely the ascent of Jim Gordon within the Gotham police force and the friendship that is established between Gordon and Batman.   <br /> <br />    In his haste to begin cleaning Gotham, Bruce jumps the gun and goes into the city armed only with his martial arts skills and a toboggan to parially shroud his identity.  He is stabbed and nearly killed.  He realizes that he needs to be more careful and methodical in his crusade to erase crime.   <br /> <br />    Meanwhile, a young cop named Gordon is transferred from Chicago to Gotham City.  Under the jurisdiction of a tyrannical, corrupt police commissioner and his lackeys, Gordon sacrifices his own well-being rather than his principles.   <br /> <br />    Each of the two men learn from their pain and losses and through their own development, continue down paths that eventually merge into one.  The book reaches a climax when it appears that the corrupt police force may destroy the Batman.   <br /> <br />    \\"Batman:  Year One\\" may well have inspired parts of the latest Batman movie, \\"Batman Begins.\\"  If you liked the movie, you will probably like the book.   <br /> <br />     Miller brings a level of determination to the Batman character that seems appropriate.  Despite setbacks, Batman does not relent in his passionate bid to bring justice to  <br />Gotham.  Through ingenuity and tenacity, Batman challenges the city's acquiescence to injustice.  I liked this book.
B0000A118M|5.0|I've just started exploring jazz and this is definately the best album I've bought so far. With this album, John Coltrane takes you on a journey. It's as if you're watching a movie. A real masterpiece, which you can listen over and over and over...
B00001OH7X|3.0|A much overlooked gem this.  Most likely forgotten because it came right after the exceptional Low and Heroes, it is a fitting coda to them.  It's not experimental like its two predecessors but as usual with Bowie it's the quality of the songwriting that shines through. <br /> <br />Fantastic Voyage is a fantastic song, Move On and Red Sails are quality too. Side two kicks off with the album's three strong singles and finishes with Red Money, which is a re-working of Iggy Pop's Sister Midnight. <br /> <br />It's a bit of a low key album but none the worse for that. At its best (Look Back In Anger, Boys Keep Swinging) it's very very good and even at its more mediocre moments it surpasses most of what's around.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Love this CD and recommend it to anyone open to listening to a group that doesn't shy away from taking risks and constantly comes out with new and challenging ideas to further their listener's musical journey. <br />
B00005NWLO|5.0|I had this on LP in 1977 it was great then. It's even better now!
B00005JNSK|5.0|You just need to get the old version of the movie out of your head before you see this, and approach it with an open mind.  It's not really a musical, and it's not exclusively a kid's movie.  But to my mind it's the best movie Tim Burton ever made, and considerably increased my assessment of Johnny Depp, whom you will find weird if you were hoping for Gene Wilder and wonderful if you were hoping for the actual Willy Wonka as written by the original author, Roald Dahl.    I had the strange experience of seeing Johnny Depp in \\"Finding Neverland\\" and two days later in \\"Chocolate Factory.\\"  Johnny's turn as Willy Wonka is the strangest, weirdest, and most engaging performance of any kind I've seen in years.  It's what Jim Carrey in \\"Unfortunate Events\\" couldn't be: interesting, complex, and subtle.  It makes the new \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" not only the best movie of the summer but one that will be worth owning and rewatching time and again.    More importantly, Depp's and director Tim Burton's vision of the Roald Dahl novel seems much closer to Dahl's own way of thinking:  in Dahl novels, adults are incomprehensibly self-involved, ignoring their malevolent influence on the kids in their lives (which is ironic when you come to think of it; as in real life it often feels like the reverse).  It's up to a few right-thinking kids to teach the grownups how to live.  This inside-out dynamic registers on every close-up of Willy Wonka's twitchy face: staring at the wrong moments, scarcely in control of his limbs, you can see the effects of Wonka's own unsympathetic upbringing.    Director Tim Burton's incredible visual imagination seems to have melded with his own recent status as a dad here.  The cinematography features acid-trippy colors; the chocolate-factory sets have an overwhelming amount to look at.  There are subtle funny visual references to other Burton films:  when we first see Wonka, he is carrying a HUGE pair of shears (shades of Edward Scissorhands); when a team of bike-riding messengers streams out of the factory to post announcements, they are riding bright-red wacky PeeWee Herman-style bikes.    Best of all are the Oompa Loompas (or, I should say, THE Oompa-Loompa), all played by a single actor (Deep Roy), who gamely dances through the Oompa-Loompa song in its various forms, including disco-style, Beatles-style, and a most delicious Queen parody.    If you don't quite \\"get\\" all this, and were hoping for a more straightforward Disneyfied version of the tale (or miss the \\"Candy Man\\" song, which was certainly not Dahl's), you may not like this.  But my advice is don't press for explanations, just go and enjoy it - as Wonka himself says, \\"Candy doesn't have to have a point - that's why it's CANDY.\\"
B00005JMXX|2.0|What else can you say? The plot is simply bad science fiction. The ending as the vice president apologizes for whatever it is that he is apologizing for, is simply stupid. Despite the fact that ice ages have happened before with no input from humankind, this iceage was allegedly caused solely by human beings. <br /> <br />This movie is not in any way politically incorrect. It is the epitome of political correctness. The message?? The VP, who is a clone of Cheney, is a stupid evil and ignorant man. He represents all of the stupid evil and ignorant humans who are causing global warming. What is politically incorrect about that? You can read that opinion in any newspaper on any day.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|The first track alone, \\"Dance Me to the End of Love,\\" is worth the price of the CD.  It is superb.  The Dylan song is also very good, but not as great.  The rest of the tracks are good, but not quite on the same level as the other two.  Yes, it is eerie how much Peyroux sounds like Billie Holiday.  But while her voice is very like Holiday's, it seems better, with a pinch of Peggy Lee.  Holiday's instrument really wasn't great, but her musicality and her delivery was unique, undefinable and otherworldly--and wonderful.  No one ever could copy Holiday, though many have tried.  Peyroux isn't imitating Holiday, that's clear.  Here is an artist of the highest caliber who is tapping into the same rich, deep source as Holiday, and the result is moving and beyond description.  Peyroux is a great artist!
B00080ZG10|4.0|Director Martin Scorsese's biopic \\"The Aviator\\" is a huge, exuberant Hollywood production which covers approximately three decades in the life of a real Hollywood production kinda guy, Howard Hughes. No matter your opinion of the film's virtues, it certainly would be difficult to say that it is not entertaining. How could it be otherwise? \\"The Aviator\\" lavishly depicts Hollywood's Golden Age in all its glory. There are gorgeous women - Big Stars, starlets, and wannabees, all wearing fabulous period clothing; terrific music - pop and jazz; great sets; lots of fun stuff about movie making and airplane building; lessons on how to excel as a capitalist; suspense; a good storyline; and action and adventure. We also get to see Leonardo DiCaprio, as tycoon Howard Hughes, go from eccentric, to out-of-touch, (unless he has to get it together fast to save his businesses), to totally dysfunctional. Hughes' mental deterioration is painful to watch, but his decline into madness is treated with great sensitively. He is portrayed as a tragic figure, and with all his money, brilliance and success, he was just that.<br /><br />Hughes was born in Humble, Texas, where, according to an extremely weird opening scene, he was taught to loathe germs at an early age. Mother bathes naked boy child, Howard, while telling him of the dangers of disease and asking him to spell q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e. I kid you not. I wish they had cut those ridiculous first few minutes of cheap psychology. We don't need to know the roots of someone's neuroses and/or pathologies to recognize insanity. Anyway, his father, Howard Hughes, Sr.,  invented the dual cone roller bit, which allowed rotary drilling of oil wells in previously inaccessible places. Hughes Tool Company was founded to commercialize this invention. At age twenty-one, Howard Jr. inherited the company and the wealth, and this is how the original capital was acquired to make movies. As a teenager, Hughes declared that his goals in life were to become the world's best golfer, the world's best pilot, and the world's best movie producer. Despite attending many excellent schools, he never earned a diploma, however.<br /><br />The first part of the film finds Howard producing \\"Hell's Angels,\\" a multi-million dollar venture (unheard of back then), which takes well over two years to make. \\"Angels\\" is a WWI movie with lots of dogfights AND Jean Harlow, (Gwen Stefani), makes her debut performance here! The filming of many of the most dramatic dogfights is postponed for eight months, when Hughes is already way over budget and out of time, because there are no clouds - and he insists on clouds as a natural backdrop. The movie is a spectacular success, despite dire predictions. In a momentous scene, Howard meets the movie mogul Louis B. Meyer (Stanley DeSantis) at the Coconut Grove. He asks for the loan of two cameras. Meyer literally laughs in his face. Hughes is viewed as a loser, a twenty-two year-old kid who doesn't know what he is doing. He makes back his exorbitant initial investment and more - enough to finance other films, like \\"Two Arabian Knights,\\" \\"The Racket,\\" \\"The Front Page,\\" all made between 1927 and 1931. The last two were nominated for Academy Awards.<br /><br />Hughes' severe obsessive-compulsive disorder is foreshadowed here. He is the epitome of a perfectionist, seemingly never settling for less, even when the cost is way over the top. He spares no expense to achieve his goals. This is the approach he will take in making future movies, designing and building airplanes, and in other business ventures. He is clearly a man with a vision, from an early age, and ruthlessly pursues it in spite of a crippling mental illness.<br /><br />Katherine Hepburn, (Cate Blanchett), comes on the scene and into Howard's life in the early 1930's. Ms. Blanchett's outstanding performance as the extraordinary actress illuminates the screen. Apparently Scorsese told her to \\"evoke Hepburn, not impersonate her,\\" and she really pulls it off, portraying a very human woman - upper crust, confident, high-strung - and a lady who recognizes and empathizes with many of Hughes' \\"eccentricities.\\" She admits to seeing some in herself. Their troubled relationship is at the heart of the movie, making it appear that Ms. Hepburn was the love of his life. I do not know if this is true. He also had significant relationships with Ava Gardner, (Kate Beckinsale), Faith Domergue, (Kelli Garner), a fifteen year-old he is grooming for stardom, and appears with probably every attractive woman in the vicinity of Los Angeles...and then some. His casual womanizing caused some of the difficulties which split up his affair with Kate Hepburn.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. It is fair to say I would go out of my way to avoid a film he is in. I have to give him credit, however. His performance as Howard Hughes is very credible, mature, sensitive and, at times, exhilarating. He does capture the essence of Mr. Hughes and that is laudable indeed.<br /><br />Hughes was an aviation pioneer, setting various speed and distance records as a pilot, building prototype aircraft, including the infamous Spruce Goose, and then founding and growing TWA. The second part of the movie deals primarily with Hughes as an aeronautical engineer, entrepreneur and business tycoon. His chief competitor and rival is Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), owner of Pan American Airlines. Trippe uses his power and influence to insure that Pan Am maintains a monopoly on international air travel. Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, (Alan Alda), is in Trippe's pocket, and the post-WWII, rigged Senate hearing scenes in DC, accusing Hughes of wrongdoing, are wonderful. You'll want to hiss and boo at the villains.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Howard Hughes' health had been declining fast. The disintegration of his mental facilities is no surprise, as there are tragic film sequences predicting the worst, especially after his near death in a plane crash in 1946. The gruesome accident is portrayed very vividly on screen. It is a miracle he pulled himself together to attend the Senate hearings, to speak for himself with unbelievable eloquence and then forcefully go on the offensive, ultimately winning. Hughes was a man of great strengths who contributed much to society. It is unbearably sad to consider a person of such intelligence living for so many years in virtual isolation. On an up note, this is very much a film about a man who had extraordinary dreams and made them come true.<br /><br />JANAreally pulls it off, portraying a very human woman - upper crust, confident, high-strung - and a lady who recognizes and empathizes with many of Hughes' \\"eccentricities.\\" She admits to seeing some in herself.

B0009XNUK0|4.0|It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.<br /><br />The Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.<br /><br />All in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Mastering: A-<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
0385338686|5.0|Another great book by Sophie Kinsella!!! <br />I LOVED this book. If you are a fan of hers you will not be let down by her latest book. The main character Samantha is just as lovable as her previously written characters such as Becky Bloomwood (Shopoholic series)... and she gets in just as much trouble too.  <br />Sam is a workaholic and finds herself unemployed and employed again all in the same day. This new job, however, is one she cannot accomplish until she gets a little help from new found friends. <br />A great summer read. Pick up a copy now!
B000777J2S|4.0|Antony and the Johnsons are not my sort of thing. As a rule I don't have much time for camp arty posturing and posing.  But after reading a glowing review in Uncut (whom I tend to trust to give a fair review) then seeing it in my local Virgin store I thought I'd listen to it. More to pass my lunch hour than anything else.   <br /> <br />One of the good reviews I'm a Bird received on Amazon says that anyone that says they liked this immediately is lying. Well call me a liar, because even though I didn't immediately like it as much as I would grow too, I was immediately drawn to it and I knew I had to buy the album.  In fact the reason I am only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I got into the album so quickly, and with the record being fairly short, I got a little fed up of it after almost constantly playing it for a month.  But it has made its way back into my CD player for extended stays several times since then. <br /> <br />The mood is dark and haunting but with an uplifting feel to it. This is despite the songs covering such subjects as breast amputation, growing old and lonely (or at least worrying about it) and gender worries. The piano provides the main rhythm with the strings providing atmospheric backing but at the risk of repeating almost all the other reviews (good and bad) Antony's voice has to be heard to be believed. It is the one thing that makes this album special. I won't bother trying to describe it. Most others have tried and I wouldn't like to say how close they have come. <br /> <br />Suffice to say this may be an acquired taste (though I'm not too sure how I acquired such a taste!) but this album didn't receive this many good reviews as a joke.  If you are unsure if you'll like it try listening before you buy, you may be surprised. <br /> <br />
B0000074FL|5.0|Despite the critic's and fan's reaction to this album, I think it ranks in the top 3 of their albums. great song writing and playing and much better than the big music of it's time. it should've been a huge hit for them but once again the radio and critics ignored. it's ashame. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes good written rock songs. buy it now.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Great film that is hilarious and action packed. Does have some of the quirky Chinese moments in it that some Westerners might not get, but who cares! Stephen Chow and the cast are very funny and the fight sequences are a mix of old school 70's kung fu mixed in with cgi and wire work, and it works wonderfully!<br /><br />Some of the CGI is kinda shotty IMHO, plain awful at times, but...if you can ignore that, then the rest of the film is perfect. The love story angle isn't too contrived and the ending is nicely done and cute.
B000001F9E|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM OF 76 AND STILL BLOW AWAY MOST OF THE MUSIC THAT'S OUT THERE. FROM THE OPENING CHORDS TILL THE LAST NOTE, THIS IS A MUST FOR TRUE ROCK FANS. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. IF ANY OF YOU YOUNGER ROCK FANS WANT TO HEAR GREAT SONGS AND PLAYING, CHECK THIS OUT AND SEE WHAT YOU MISSED!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Rs make intensely visual music. The kind that conjures up images of blue skies, lush green Icelandic fields, and androgynous pink pre-teen soccer players (yeah, you remember that video). When in the right mood, I, for one, would be completely content listening to their brand of ethereal dream pop while watching anything at all; a snowfall at dusk, a parking lot at 3 p.m., my Snoop Dogg/Christopher Walken screensaver. Somehow, through the rose-colored filter of their majestic mini-symphonies, it's all equally poignant.  <br /> <br />Sigur Rs somehow translate painstaking into evocative, slow into moving, and often plainly cinematic into downright cathartic. Using guitar effects and strings (or guitar played with a violin bow), piano, organ, and lightly brushed drums, they make idyllic and otherworldly chamber pieces; fleeting sounds appear and disappear like ghosts before they can be identified - the odd churn of distortion or twinkle of piano keys - but the sum total is undeniably redolent and generally beautiful.  <br /> <br />The eight tracks that make up the new album are similar in nature to Agaetis Byrjun, yet as the band themselves state, there is a livelier feel among them, as if the band were playing a private concert just for your ears. All tracks are uniquely their own, each having their own surprises and their own set of layers that will be discovered after repeated listens.  <br /> <br />Among the highlights of the album is the thirteen minute opus of track seven, a song that demonstrates the many musical dimensions that their live experience brings forth. Beginning in a slow rise, with an organ sound leading the way, the song is moved by the drum's increasing beats and the singer's Yorke-esque voice which leads the way for the rising crescendo. The song's final rise is a spectacular combination of drums and cymbals with the infuriating voice of the singer, ultimately leaving the singer alone to echo his voice away in a breathtaking way. The bandcourteously gives listeners a few seconds of silence before the next song is to begin. <br /> <br />Track eight is the heaviest song of the album, which by Sigur's standards is not heavy at all, but the band's furious end of their atmospheric journey is just as intense, hard and frenetic as the hardest of the metal bands.  <br /> <br />It is impossible to describe in words the beauty that a journey through () perpetuates, so you must simply go and listen...just listen. <br /> <br />
B000002KIT|5.0|Thin Lizzy like UFO should have been BIG BIGGER BIGGEST IN America compared to crap bands like Styx and Foreigner and Heart<br />and other wimpy arena rock! Glad I got to see them a few times before the early 80's when both were gone and rock and roll died!<br />It has not recovered! Glad to see UFO is still kicking butt along with Michael Schenker and Y&T and other great rock bands of late<br />70's and early 80's! you can't kill rock and roll but rock and roll is dying! This is one of the greatest bands and live albums of all times<br />and I know for a fact the BS about it being over dubbed is BS! I have spoken to many involved with the album and have heard more<br />of the same stories and It's mostly LIVE! unlike KISS Alive! which is still a great LIVE albums! not as good as Cheap Trick at Budakon.<br />Thin Lizzy became the Thin Lizzy most love with the album Fighting which has some great moments but is weak at some points. It<br />wasn't until JAILBREAK when Lynott finally became a rock legend singer songwriter performer! Nobody has sung and written songs<br />and command a stage since Elvis! Even KISS can't compare with him at his prime! This LIVE album is a MONSTER! not a dud song<br />on it and not a weak performance! I don't think Zep or The Who ever played a concert as strong as this one! The DVD is incredible<br />and it's ashame they didn't film the entire SHOW! the bonus is the 83 show which I have had for years even though John Sykes is<br />a great guitarist he's a shredder which Lizzy never should have hired! Snowy White was perfect and Chinatown and Renegade are<br />two of Lizzy's best albums! The performance by Lizzy on this DVD in 1978 is the best live performance by a rock band ever! Phil<br />is top of his game and Robertson and Gorham are the perfect twin guitar team but the backbone and the greatest drummer in rock<br />history to me is BRIAN DOWNEY! Keith Moon or Bonham couldn't touch this guy! It's a shame he and Lizzy aren't mentioned by<br />the so called experts and media who cover rock and roll except for CLASSIC ROCK which is produced in Europe! If you buy this<br />you will not be sorry and all I can say is if you don't have any THIN LIZZY YOU DON'T KNOW REAL ROCK AND ROLL!CLASSIC ROCK which is produced in Europe! If you buy this you will not be sorry and all I can say is if you don't have any THIN LIZZY YOU DON'T KNOW REAL ROCK AND ROLL!
B00078XGRO|5.0|This is simply a must-have for every Star Trek fan.  I already had the video tape of First Contact, but the extra features and commentary were worth the price.  Listening to Jonathan Frakes laugh at his own jokes got old after a while, but his commentary was presented as if he were casually sitting in your living room watching the movie with you. <br /> <br />This is, in my opinion, the best of the Trek movies, and I'm obviously not alone on this.  I bought this DVD from Amazon because every Best Buy, Circuit City, FYE and other stores in the area were sold out.  They had dozens of all the other Star Trek movies, but this one was evidentially hard to keep in stock.
B0001O3YCG|3.0|I had recently seen the Chronicles of Riddick movie, the sequal to this, and was interested in seeing this. It was a pretty good story, lots of suspense, and action. Though, I think they could've done without the constant use bad language (particularly f--k, f---ing, etc.) It  would've been a perfectly fine show without all that in it.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty good, and I might recommend it.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I've spent 12 of my years in Illinois and Michigan...and I'm not really sure htis music has much to do with either, even though the manifest context obviously does.  I don't like crying-in-their-beer folkies at all.  And I don't like it when people proclaim their christianity so overtly.  But this album resonates profoundly for me.  His voice is (I hate to even say it) so sincere, I can't help but suspend cynicism, let the lush orchestrations wash over me, and feel more than a little bit better about life.  The use of unusual time signatures, non-obvious instrumentation (though the oboes and banjoes are less prominent than on previous albums), and oddly literal references in the lyrics make it impossible to allow these songs to fit into your psyche in conveniently defined pigeon holes.  Which is why I wonder where this stuff comes from.  Almost (but only almost) makes me want to question my outright rejection of religion:  if this can emerge from such strong spirituality, maybe it's not all bad (of course there's Mozart, Bach, et al who wrote mostly for church purposes..)
B00005JNSK|3.0|Willy Wonka (Depp) has been in seclusion for years.  One day, it is announced that Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in the wrappers of five million candy bars to be sold around the world.  Those who find the tickets will get a tour of the Wonka candy factory.  One by one, the tickets are found, and the winners are announced...Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, and finally, Charlie Bucket.  The first four are gluttonous, spoiled, an overachiever, and a TV addict respectively.  Charlie, on the other hand, is just poor.  When the group arrives at the factory, they are all introduced into the the strange world of Willy Wonka.  Willy also tells the kids that one of them will get a special surprise.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka with a creepy intensity.  To say that he is odd would be an understatement, and most of the time he is acting unexpectedly.  The movie itself is a treat for the eyes, as most movies by Tim Burton are.  The chocolate factory is filled with wonders, and run by the Oompa Loompas, all played by actor Deep Roy.  They steal all the scenes that they are in, providing songs about the childrens' misguided actions.<br /><br />I have read that Roald Dahl's family is endorsing it, and can't help but think that most people will like it, especially if they liked the original.  Unfortunately for me, I found the movie only slightly less annoying than the original.  So, while I can say that it is an improvement, I can't say that it did much for me.

B00004XOWM|1.0|Somehow Limp Bizkit manages to make nu-metal even less appealing, not even the mallrats like this crap anymore. Their guitars are 3 chords played over and over, downtuned to cover up their lack of talent; how clever of them. The drummer plays the same boring beats over and over, he never tries to add anything interesting. The vocalist/rapper sounds like he's going through puberty, not really surprising, this CD is probably most appealing to squeaky annoying pre-teens. Stay away from this crap, nu-metal is dead. Even disco is cooler now.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Like I said before, a Tom Cruise lover will love this movie
B000000OUE|5.0|When I first heard White Zombie I think the first words that came to my lips were \\"what the f*** is this?\\" because honestly I was scared, and kinda creeped out by the first track on this album, \\"Electric Head Pt. 1 (The Agony).\\" At first you think \\"OK, I'm getting some kinda weird-ass, nonsensical band. But what you will discover is that White Zombie is kinda like metal's \\"The Jesus Lizard,\\" in a strange, slightly more normal way. But whatever you think, White Zombie's \\"Astro Creep: 2000\\" is an extremely refreshing and wonderfully disturbing trip into insanity...<br /><br />The title of the album is actually alot more obtuse (as you probably know), but that kinda reflects White Zombie's attitude towards excess and material wealth in modern society. Basically, they don't agree with it at all. Of course it goes further than that, even to absurd lengths with song names like \\"Grease Paint and Monkey Brains,\\" which is well, a pretty odd, creepy song that'll have you wondering if you're OK in the head. Despite White Zombie's over-the-top and weird-ass covering, they are a really interesting band capable of diverse, original material, which is revealed through this unique, incredible album.<br /><br />If this is your first White Zombie album, you are guaranteed to be creeped out and confused after track 1. But then \\"Super-Charger Heaven,\\" kicks in, which is one amazingly killer song! It starts off with a brief, weird voiceover, and then kicks into some awesome rocking metal riffs! It's undoubtedly the best song on the album: the guitars crunch and whine and the drums smash through the blazing riffs. And Rob sounds great, almost \\"sing-mumbling\\" his words during the verses and going into all out Metal shouting during the choruses. But that isn't all. \\"Creature Of The Wheel,\\" is the heaviest song with a pounding riff and is basically the Zombie doing all out Metal. And Rob comes through very strongly on this song, giving it a heavy/creepy sound. \\"El Phantasmo and the Chicken-Run Blast-o-Rama,\\" while having the weirdest title, is a pretty heavy, well constructed song that has nothing to do with chicken blasting whatsoever (sorry for those of you who expected it). Possibly the most dynamic vocal arrangements are on this song, where Rob's voice are both the vocals as well as a backing instrument in certain areas.<br /><br />The philosophy behind White Zombie seems to be this: to create mixed emotions and keeping the listener intrigued with its creepy songs and interpolating them with funky/metal/techno songs. A really clever system if you think about it 'cos you'll NEVER get bored or fail to be surprised. The album is an emotional cauldron really and by the end of it you'll feel like you've been to, well, hell and back I guess. It's creepy, freaky, heavy, disturbing, complex, insane, interesting - no doubt about that!<br /><br />So all in all if you're looking for an album that's WAY out there but still stays safely within the confines of Metal, White Zombie's \\"Astro Creep: 2000\\" will definitely be your slice of cake. Or maybe monkey brains?ken-Run Blast-o-Rama,\\" while having the weirdest title, is a pretty heavy, well constructed song that has nothing to do with chicken blasting whatsoever (sorry for those of you who expected it).

B00000DGXN|5.0|This album is a must have. Dave Holland and Roy Haynes hold down the time so effortlessly. Every player complements every other player so well that if someone is phrasing in triplets or sixteenths the rest of the group is really feeling that time too. It's hard to describe but the interplay on this disc is about as good as it gets and it feels so natural and swinging. The song selection was well planned. There are very slow tunes as well as very fast ones, making this a good album to listen to straight through. Unfortunately the mix is not as good as it should be. Pat and especially Dave sound particularly muddy. But I bet it would be difficult to mix for three chordal melody instruments, piano, vibes and guitar with such similar overtones. Still, this disc would be worth buying just for Dave... or Pat... or Chick... or Gary... or Roy. Everyone is so turbo-fantastic!

If you can get both of you to read it and follow through with what the author is trying to get across, then there would be more happy couples in the world and less divorces or breakups!  :-)  I highly recommend this book!

B00009V7P8|4.0|Allright, I thougt that this album was overall very good, but it didn't rise to the five star level that most other reviewers gave it.  Most of the songs on this CD are very good and there are some that just aren't as good as the others.  I heard most of the songs on the movie \\"Alfie\\" and decided that I had to have it after hearing \\"The Blowers Daughter\\" during the opening scene, but after buying it, I found that the rest of the CD falls a little short from this song.  As a Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, and DMB fan, I would definately recommend this CD.
B000001FMX|5.0|Alot has been said about this album.  Usually, you hear words like 'trashy', 'sleazy' and 'sloppy' banded about when describing it.  The band definitely played with these elements in the creation of their sound and image.  The more you listen to them, however, the more you understand just how amazingly stylish and sophisticated they really were.  Technically, they weren't perfect or polished players, but they had mastered their instruments to a level that more than sufficed and by this point in history it was clear that technique was only one ingredient in the art of music.  If Glam Rock was about style over substance, then the Dolls were a perfect balance between the two, often accomplishing a sum greater than the parts.
B00006RINF|1.0|Maybe I've been listening to too much Nightwish.  But after carefully listening to Lacuna Coil's Comalies a few times, I still didn't like it!  I found the melodies repetitive and the lyrics meaningless.   <br />    Yet it was the singing which disappointed me most.  While not as bad as some other reviewers suggested, it was still worse than I had expected.  Christina Scabbia may very well be a \\"good\\" (or even a \\"great\\") singer but I didn't hear it here.  <br />Her voice did not \\"stand out\\" in any way for me like Tarja Turunen's or even Mariah Carey's!  <br />   Too bad my online speakers aren't working.  Otherwise, I could've saved myself some money!
B00079HZUM|3.0|Like Boogie Nights, this film dealt with a transitional moment in a sexually-inflected form of entertainment.  Here it was the change from male actors playing to women to \\"real women\\" on stage.  The details of that shift, from the mannered and stylized acting of \\"stage beauties\\" like Billy Crudup's character, to the \\"naturalism\\" of female actors like Claire Danes', should have been fascinating, but they weren't treated in any depth.  Even though the movie was rather short, the editing rushed us through scenes, and we didn't spend enough time behind the scenes.  I for one was fascinated when the movie represented the directing and rehearsal process; there just wasn't enough of it, or it wasn't presented in consistent doses.  This had potential, but it never seemed to decide what it was really about: was it the love story of Ned and Maria, or was it the advent of a new acting style, or was it about Kings and their erratic (if not erotic) manifestations of divinity?  Billy Crudup was mostly very charismatic, but I didn't buy much of Claire Danes' work--it seemed like it would have been a kick-ass role for Helena Bonham-Carter.  Absorbing, definitely worth a few viewings, but not very satisfying.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I was very happy about the dvd. My opinon of this dvd is excellent.
B000002UA0|4.0|PGD was recorded in early 1967 in an Abbey Road studio next-door to where the Beatles were concurrently recording Sgt. Pepper's. The Pink Floyd band members met the Beatles while they were recording \\"Lovely Rita\\". It seems as though there was some friendly competition between them at the time to see who could make the most psychedelic album. However, Sgt. Pepper's was released on June 1, 1967 (June 2 in the States), two months ahead of PiperGatesDawn, which was released on August 5, 1967.<br /><br />The first single from PGD was released in March 1967, and reached #20 on the U.K. charts. The following single, \\"See Emily Play\\" (not on the album), and the PGD album itself both reached #6 U.K. The album's total time is 41:50. The title \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" was taken from a character in the children's story \\"Wind In The Willows\\".<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Astronomy Domine\\", an underground psychedelic classic with a pulsating cosmic feel, and Barrett's whimsical fairytales, \\"Matilda Mother\\", \\"Flaming\\", \\"The Gnome\\", and \\"The Scarecrow\\". A few of the other songs (such as \\"Bike\\") don't appeal to me from a musical standpoint even though they have some good lyrics.
0521397812|4.0|This book contains many quick activities that require little preparation.  It's a good tool for use in the EFL classroom.  Many of the activities seem geared for middle school and up, though they can be easily adapted for elementary students.  This book would be quicker to use if the activities were marked as appropriate for beginner, intermediate and advanced at the beginning of the description.
B000002U9W|5.0|It was released in 1970, at 52 minutes, a long album for that time. It reached #1 U.K. and #55 on the U.S. Billboard charts, and went \\"Gold\\" in 1994. Considering its Amazon sales rank, it can no longer be considered a \\"cult favorite\\" or \\"obscure\\" (except in relation to Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, two of the biggest-selling rock albums ever), or \\"underrated\\" (except by its own band). Anyone who likes progressive music (like Mike Oldfield) or rock music with classical influences should like it though the instrumental nature of its longest tracks may turn off some Pink Floyd fans. The more familiar Floyd sound can be heard on \\"If\\" (a Waters ballad), \\"Summer '68\\", and \\"Fat Old Sun\\".
0316776963|4.0|This is not a novel as such, but more a series of short stories from various phases of the author's life... and being raised by Greek immigrant parents, before moving to France, via a series of odd jobs gives plenty of opportunity for some hysterical anecdotes.  <br /> <br />This book has the same feel as an entertaining acquaintance recounting his experiences over a drink or the dinner table, and even the events that aren't that funny by nature are transformed by this natural storyteller. <br />
B000002U9Y|4.0|Released June 1968, this album continues the psychedelic music from Pink Floyd's first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but Barrett's nutty fairytales are replaced by more space-rock, such as \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", and Roger Water's first Floyd song about war, \\"Corporal Clegg\\". It was a transitional album as they were in the process of booting out their leader, Syd Barrett, due to his bizarre behavior.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Star Trek TNG, Star Wars, and others are fun to watch, but they can't match the quality writing and characters in Firefly. <br /> <br />Even though the series was cancelled, it does come to a kind of ending with the last episode. And then the movie Serenity is coming as a follow-up.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels. He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out. So they both embark on a investigation that includes half breed demons strait out of episodes of Buffy and Angel, angels that look way too asexual for words and the devil himself, who looks like he just got back from gambling trip in Atlantic City. Now if you think that I'm being a tad over the top in my plot summery, think again. I'm actually being way too kind. Now it's very hard to start off with the good parts of the film with out addressing the very bad parts of it first and that's Keanu Reeves himself. I do think that he's a good actor with some promise but he's miscast in this role as a hardboiled and cynical private eye with supernatural connections and his sour face demeanor does not help him out with his character at all. There is a subplot that involves that his heath adds nothing to the overall story at all and his character borders between self important idiot to whiney bastard that cries to god when he does not get his way. His transformation into his Neo persona during the last act of the film takes away a lot from what the movie was supposed to be all about and just turns it into a sad parody of itself. The screenplay feels like a hack job in some places and some characters don't really serve a purpose at all other than to be killed off or to just be a part of the scenery. Some character don't really need to be in the movie at all like the character of Chaz played by Shia LaBeouf, who really adds nothing to the movie other than to be a really bad side kick to our sour faced hero and the angel Gabriel who is played by Tilda Swinton, who for starters is only in the film for about ten minutes and really adds nothing to it other than to have a really bad scene with John Constantine that will make you sit up and take notice on how bad this film really is and the last act, where her character is a part of one of the most stupid plot revelations in recent movies (it involves the devil, who is dressed like a pool hall gambler from Atlantic City.) I don't hold Tilda Swinton, responsible for this (she is a very good actress) as much as I hold the screenwriters who wrote her role because we don't really know enough about her character to be surprise with the sudden turn around that she does in the last act of the film. The screenplay itself feels like it does not know what it wants to be from time to time, switching it's tone from dark horror drama to dumb down action movie in the last fifteen minutes of the film and some of the dialog is so badly written that you are grinning your teeth to the bone when you hear it. While there are a lot of bad in this film, there are some bright spots that make the film somewhat bearable to sit though. The best of these is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which is literally holding this film together by a thin and dangling thread. She gives this movie something the script should have giving it and that something is called class. Her performance is gripping and soul searching and its what the film really should have been about if you had serious people behind scenes making it. Which is too bad because the movie would have worked much better as a standard supernatural thriller with just her character in it instead of the mind numbing mess that is presented to us here. Djmon Hounsou is great as well but he's not really in the movie much at all and his character is really just there for camp effect, not substance. The special effects are cool for what they are and they do have a visual impact but not even that is strong enough to make you forget how cheesy the film is after it ends.  <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I highly recommend that you buy this cd. It's absolutely wonderful! All of the songs sound different so if you heard one of My Chemical Romance's songs and didn't really like it that doesn't necessarily mean you won't like the others. I personally love them all. The band has a very unique and captivating sound. They have definitely brought rock to a greater new level.
0446677450|2.0|The book is a bestseller because it plays on the common sentiment that cash-generating capital assets make for safer long term bets than debt-inducing ones. To dumb it down: buy a house while you skip that latest Lexus or Plasma telly. Assets good, liabilities bad.<br /><br />Simple and perfectly predictable idea, but while we're making a book of it, why not weave a thicket of redundant text including choice comments such as this, I quote:<br /><br />\\"Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets. Soon your asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments that have returns of 100 percent to infinity. Investments that for $5000 are soon turned into $1 million and more.\\"<br /><br />To the extent that Kiyosaki's definition of 'wealth' represents the ability to cover living expenses with passive income, there is merit to the idea of investing in cash generating assets. But it is hard not to question advice from an author who, before this supposed one-trick real estate panacea, used to advise people to pile their coin into Nasqaq IPOs.<br /><br />He makes it sound like a cakewalk. Actionable advice is conspicuous by its absence, except perhaps for a suggestion nearly 150 pages into the ordeal: build your own small cap stock company and enjoy the superior returns as the inside investor.<br /><br />If only it were that simple.<br /><br />This being a review perhaps it must be added that the writing is annoyingly hokey, full of his supposedly middle class Hawaiian dad who led a conservative life while doting on a fictitious uncle who had it rolling thanks to his ingenious investment strategies. Not that this matters, but this has since been debunked, this father and this uncle were concocted purely for the book (ref: Smart Money).<br /><br />If you're truly considering some responsible reading, may I suggest a few books that will make their level-headed points without tripping over shiny financial mumbo-jumbo:<br /><br />1.

B00003CXIP|5.0|This is one of the DVDs that i would watch once every month or two <br />I love the story of about these 4 boys setting off an andventure into the woods to find a body, when i told my friend it was a stephen  <br />king movie, she thought it was going to be terrifying but it truly revolves around 4 kids. Wil weaton plays a kid whose brother has just died <br />in a car accident while his parents mourn his brothers death they show no affection for  him at all. The problem is that the problem was still <br />there they didn;t care about anything wil weaton character's did. All they cared about was their eldest son played by jon cusack.The thing is Jon cusack's character is very sweet, the kind of brother that would be <br />lookig over his little brother. there was a scene <br />where wil weaton's character was remembering \\"he, his brother and parents were sitting eating a meal, the father and mother would just make conversation with jon cusack, jon cusack tries to tell them, that his little brother wrote a story <br />and all the father cared about was football this and that, while the mother asks about girls. hello, give some attention to the poor kid, he has a talent, it may not be footbal, it is writing. <br />Honestly, everytime wil remembers his brother I feel like crying, because he was the only one in his family who truly cared for him and now he's gone. <br />They go on a trip to see corpse of a boy their own age. As the journey was set,they had a good time, had a few laughs, few cries and discovered things about their characters. <br /> <br />Yes the movie has kids using bad language, but it wasnt the focus really <br />Yes there is a scene where everyone vomits on each other in a story told by wil weaton's character, i say fastforward it if you dont want to see it.  <br /> <br />This movie is one of my favorites definitely.

B0009XNUK0|4.0|With as many hits as Michael Jackson has, it's hard to narrow down a definitive collection to just two CDs, much less one. However, Sony did well with this collection. To date, I would have to say it is the definitive Michael Jackson collection. It has something from each period in Michael's career... from his origins as a star with the Jackson Five to his last studio album, Invincible. <br /> <br /> I think the tracks selected for this album are a very good representation of MJ's career. I do disagree with a few of the tracks, and feel that they should have been replaced with other songs. \\"I'll Be There,\\" \\"Scream,\\" \\"Butterflies,\\" and \\"We've Had Enough\\" would have made nice additions. There are indeed a couple of non-singles appearing on this collection, which is a bit interesting. Nevertheless, this is probably the one Michael Jackson album to have. It spans his entire career and does it with a great selection of songs. If you're looking for one Michael Jackson album to purchase, I'd reccomend this one.
B000001DYD|5.0|The female rock icon has been replaced by the pop image who doesn't even write her own songs. This sad fact is one that the musical mastress PJ Harvey says \\"F**k it!\\" to on her her second, and best, album \\"Rid of Me\\". The album is an achievement of sound and lyrics.  Every line is bursting with raw meotion and contempt as well as obsession and pain. Grief for the new tomorrow and sorrow for today are converyed by the way Harvey's voice rips them from her throat and spray paints them across the air in anguish. Screaming agony is mixed with harsh guitars and celllos as the album makes points with sound just as well as with words.<br /><br />The album opens with the obsession tale, \\"Rid of Me\\". The slow almost surf rock beginning bursts into an onslught of drums and fades and forth until the song comes to its brashing climax with \\"Lick my lips, I'm on fire. Lick my legs. I'm desire.\\" After this your attention is caught and your expectations are set. The album keeps up it's quality throughout the disc with the moaning \\"Legs\\", the cello based \\"Man Sized Sextet\\" and its guitar based counterpart \\"Man Size\\" as well as a Bob Dylan cover and a wondeful Garden of Eden analogy \\"Snake\\".<br /><br />The album has been out for some years now, but like any great album it continues to evolve all by its own and is revolutionary for any generation of listeners. I highly recommend this album, as it is my personal top ten, and hope that you enjoy it as much as I do with each listen.

And then there is Nirvana, my religion, the band that saved my life! Listening to Nevermind was the most important moment in my whole life! It shows me that there is another America than Goerge Bush's, it shows me that there's more than Hollywood, the Pentagon or the White House.  <br />I had never seen or heard such authenticity, nothing had ever meet my feelings, my soul and my mind than this music. There is much more in the USA than patriotism, naivity and mendacity. This band is a demonstration of truth and real feelings. When I think of this music, I have a much better opinion about the USA! Music can handle such things and Nirvana made it, at least by me. <br />Nirvana isn't just Rock, Nirvana isn's just a band, which created Grunch, Nirvana is more than just music! Nirvana is the feeling of being alive, Nirvana can make people believe in something, who didn't believe in anything before, Nirvana is my religion! People, who really try to understand this, won't be able to hate this music...

B000002ADT|5.0|I am usually a pretty serious, though non-mainstream, Classical music fan. So it's a little unusual for me to be commenting on a jazz recording. But in this case I simply have to as this is the recording that opened my eyes to jazz as no other album has before or since. Discovering Kind of Blue was a total revelation to me. It made me realise just what an amazing art form jazz really is and just how Miles Davis stands as one of the truly greats of 20th century music - ALL 20th century music irrespective of genre. Of course I had heard plenty of jazz before this including lots of Loius Armstrong but this was the first time jazz had gotten under my skin like this.  <br /> <br />The modal jazz here clearly reflects the interest in the old church modes that you can find in the music of composers such as Stravinsky in his writings from around the 1950's and it helps give this music an elysian quality, an intensely soothing sound that I never knew possible in music. As I first listened to this music, suddenly the meaning of the word 'cool' became clear to me. Sure everyone says \\"hey that's cool, man\\" using the word 'cool' as a bland whoopee word. But just listen to the opening bar of Kind of Blue and THAT'S what 'cool' really means - divinely classy, hynotically calming for all the depth of the melancholy that the blues command. It was a divine moment that lifted jazz high up into a supreme artform. Miles Davis is the epitome and very definition of the word 'cool', the sine qua non without which the word has no meaning. <br /> <br />Irrespective of your musical taste this is something you have to hear at least once before you die, for this is a true desert island CD if there ever was one - and life just wouldn't be quite complete without it.
0765309408|5.0|What a great surprise! Real old fashioned hard core SciFi, I never thought I would find a new novel that brought back the wonders of my youthful discovery of Science Fiction.  If you have been hungry for a great old fashioned SciFi romp this is it. Not in anyway to be described as literature this is just a solid great read, lots of action, intriguing but non-boring science future, solid characters, even the lightest touch of romance with zero \\"smarmyness\\".  This book is not only a pleasure to read, it's actually funny with sarcastic comments winging all over the place.  Edward Trimnel said in his review:  \\"For the most part, Scalzi's humor is on target, and I often found myself laughing at the jokes. At the same time, I also wondered if senior citizens would ever really talk this way, either now or at any point in the future.\\"  Well, actually senior citizens DO talk that way to each other all the time.. at least my set does. Some of the comments were so good I phoned a couple of friends in the late night just to share and we all had a good laugh.  <br /> <br />So glad I impulsively ordered this.  Worth every penny times 10.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I think the first 3 songs on this CD are some of Nightwishes best work. I was very impressed with this CD in general.
B00004UQRF|4.0|Black Celebration... Mmm... Where to start? I was introduced to Depeche Mode via Music for the Masses back in 1988 (I was 13), and all of the sudden I wanted everything by them but, as I live in Mexico, that wasn't an easy task.<br /><br />I clearly remember some guy (a record seller) at a flea market telling me \\"Oh, boy. You like Depeche Mode? You MUST get Black Celebration. It's their best album yet\\". That happened around 1989, I guess. So I tried to look for it and finally got BC on cassette, and I was so moved by the music and the themes, it made me cry most of the times I played the thing in my room.<br /><br />This record marks the moment Depeche Mode became these huge thinking-man's pop-rock band. The topics here are truly negative, but most parts of life are, and I think only dumb people try to look at the bright side of life without taking the time to fully enjoy and embrace all of the bad and the good.<br /><br />Musically, the album sounds depressive and haunting, with lots of beautiful loops and beats, and those harsh metallic sounds that became such an iconic part of DM's approach to production.<br /><br />Every song on this album is great, but I'd like to add the fact that But Not Tonight wasn't originally released on Black Celebration, so the album closed with New Dress and But Not Tonight is such a brilliant addition, because after all the sadness and desperation we've been through the day we are able to find joy in this song. It's like saying \\"everything's a mess, but still we can't regret being born\\". Jesus Christ! What a great way of ending such an album!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because I think the production sounds dated, unlike Music For the Masses and Violator. But I think it adds to the experience of listening to it. If you're new to Depeche Mode, try Violator or Ultra or Music for the Masses, and once you have difested those, then try this beautiful thing.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|This movie is excellent; thats why I ordered it. It was in excellent condition, but I don''t know why it wouldn't be if I oredered it brand new direct from Amazon.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Instead of the pastel cotton-candy delight that was the 1971 -Willy Wonka-, this version opts for the more bittersweet charms of a more realistic story & Roald Dahl's original Oompa-loompa songs.<br /><br />Johnny Depp inhabits the darker clothes of Tim Buron's/Roald Dalh's candymaker.  Unlike Gene Wilder, whose Wonka was a conniving [what else do you call his 'slugworth ploy' & short temper] kid-seeker, Depp's Wonka has a real reason for confectionary perfection.  Christopher Lee is superb as a sadistic dentist who doesn't understand his kid.  The other 4 Golden Ticket winners are stickily nasty, Charlie's family *feels* poor - none of this Lil'-Orphan-Annie sacccharine 'poorness' but real, grinding poverty w/the attendant low self-esteem - & there's a sinister  feel to Wonka's factory.<br /><br />Deep Roy works well as the Oompa-loompas [all of them], masterfully 'creating' the personalities of half-a-dozen individuals.  & there's real chemistry between Depp & Freddie Highmore [courtesy -Finding Neverland-, where Fredddie was Peter to Depp's Barrie], which translates to Wonka's 'falling' for the gentle Charlie, after his [Wonka's] original antipathy to both kids & parents [again, not surprising considering Wonka's years-long isolation from people].<br /><br />Finally - thank the goddess! - there's an actual *ending* to his 1!  I kept waiting, thru the sweet strains of Leslie Bricusse's tunes, to learn the fate of Charlie's family, but they seem to have vanished into the same dark hole as every1 else but Charlie, Wonka, & Grampa Joe.  Here, we learn their fate - & Charlie seems the more reasonable & responsible for his choice - leading into resolution w/them *&* Wonka.  A superb film.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Rush Limbaugh is fond of saying that liberals hate him because he shines the light of truth on them.Apparently that explains why conservatives think Michael Moore is the worth thing that ever happened to them.After his previous film, Bowling For Columbine, right wingers were up in arms, especially because Moore himself confronted NRA spokesmen Charlton Heston in his own home and asked him why that orginization always held rallies right after a gun tragedy happened...and the rally would be in the same city as the tragedy.It was powerful stuff to watch, not because you wanted to see Heston shrink and stumble for words, but instead because certain questions need to be answered. In Farenheit 911 Moore is doing a lot of asking and a lot of conservatives are doing a lot of dodging,i.e.especially when Moore tries to get Congressmen to explain why none of their kids are in Iraq fighting the \\"good fight\\" <br />  Moore, as a documentary film-maker is ruthless and that's why he is effective.Nowhere else will you see footage of a perplexed George Bush sitting in a schoolhouse chair on the morning of 911, seemingly frozen after getting word that something big was shaking out there.Painful to watch, but necessary.It used to be the presses job to give us the facts but these days there seems to be a gag order on members of the media, especially when it concerns this administration and the war in Iraq. You don't want your wife outed for being in the CIA, do you? <br />   Moore made no secret of the fact that he was trying to influence the outcome of the   2004 presidential election by putting this film out when he did...and it almost worked. But in the end Carl Rove and the other masterminds who work for Bush managed to prevail through smear and slander. They managed to trash Moore and his film and sent the swift-boat vets to take care of John Kerry.Republicans everywhere condemned Moores'film as a pack of lies but they had no real way of explaining away the facts presented in it.Limbaugh condemned the film but admitted to his listeners that he's never seen it himself...instead he took the advise of people who told him it was a \\"cut & paste job\\". Strange coming from a guy who often complains that people critisize his show without ever having heard it. But let's get back to Moore... <br />  \\"911\\" is a must for people who want to try and make sense of what happened in Washington and around the country after...and in some cases before...September 11, 2001. It becomes apparent that the Bush administration was not focused on the terrorist threat before that tragic day and after it was history they tried to take advantage of it in the form of convincing Americans that the country of Iraq and it's leader, Saddam Hussein, were an \\"imminent threat\\" that needed to be dealt with immediately. But \\"911\\" is also about much more than that. It is about corruption in all of politics and how that effects those of us in this country who still believe that America is a great place and freedom is a great blessing. The caveat in this movie is that our freedoms are under assault, not from without bit from within(,e.g the Patriot Act, illegal immigration, the silencing of the media)and the only way that we can protect that freedom is by dealing with the cold, hard facts. <br />   So we can harp on the fact that Michael Moore is an overweight guy who dresses like a slob or we can attest to the fact that he makes one hell of a documentary and forces us to think.
B00097A5HW|1.0|I figured this CD was a waste.  Shes a waste, and there is nothing on this CD, or any of her other previous CD's.  By far, Shakira, You suck.  Shes a Cop-Off of alanis morset...who wants to listen to this garbage.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|...of the music industry not being able to adapt to changing technology and trends.  I'm giving this 1-star because I have yet to actually listen to the disc.  I listen to a lot of music at work, but do not have install rights on my work PC, so I can't listen to it.
B0009I7O7U|5.0|Back in December I bought the CD version when it came out because I heard John Legend on a couple of Kanye West's tracks, at first I was mad that the DualDisc version came out way AFTER the regular version and I was hesitant to shell out another 13-14 bucks for it but once I actually heard the new 5.1 version of it I knew it was a good buy. Record companies REALLY need to stop releasing the DualDisc format of albums months after the original, all versions need to be released simultaneously!!!
B00001QEE8|5.0|This movie is delightful entertainment for the whole family and it shows the old classics are just as popular today as they were back when they were first released and now on digital format even better.  It certainly reveals the expertese of those who made the movie and how ahead of their time they were in the graphics and how talented they were in producing the result they did without all the technology that we have today. <br />A must have for all DVD buffs!!! <br />SueF
0618154043|5.0|A rich supplement to the marvellous stories of The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. Gives the fuller tale of the events in Middle-earth. An essential book in any Tolkien lovers' bookshelf!
B000002MJR|5.0|This is known as the BEST cd by Dire Straits! Check out songs <br />such as Callin' Elvis, Walk of Life, Heavy Fuel, Romeo and Juliet, Private Investigations, Your Latest Trick, Money for  <br />Nothing, and the very good, Brothers in Arms. Those maybe all <br />my favorites. Especially songs such as Heavy Fuel, and Private <br />Investigations are really heavy on metal. This is a great CD <br />if you are a heavy metal fan.
0783225482|4.0|As a hilariously funny, dark comedy dealing with our obsession for youth and vitality, 'Death Becomes Her' explores the extremes of vanity. If you have a twisted sense of humor, you will truly appreciate this juicy piece of work.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This album is heck of a great CD! I mean every song on this album <br />are HITS!!! This album has 2 songs that play really heavy on metal and those 2 would be Private Investigations, and It Never <br />Rains. This maybe my favorite release by Dire Straits behind the <br />great, Making Movies, and the even better, On the Night. Every <br />song rocks! Also, Check out the +10 minute song, Telegraph Road, <br />Industrial Disease, and Love over Gold song. Those 3 are also <br />hits, and are one of my favorites. This CD is heck worth the great money so buy this album today, and check out all the songs.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is the all time best feel good movie. There are some movies that you can watch over and over again. I could watch this movie every single night of the week.  I love it.   What a fantastic line up of stars.  Acting is superb. Emma Thompson is such a delight as is Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney and most especially Bill Nighy.  <br />  I highly recommend this movie. <br />
B00000255F|5.0|This classic masterpiece from Bruce Springsteen is one of the greatest rock n roll albums ever recorded. That's not even debatable. Just buy the album if you want to listen to some of the greatest american music ever created.
0061015725|4.0|this is the first michale chricton book I've read, although I've seen several of his movies.. <br /> <br />this book sucked me in from the get go...the main character, while very intelligent, is more or less an every man..not infallible, not super athletic and good at everything...that's what I liked about him so much, as with all the characters in this book....the key to any good characters are their flaws and how they deal with them... <br /> <br />very interesting story line and the pace just keeps the pages turning constantly..almost couldn't put this one down =)  fantastic dialogue a well..definetly worth your time!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I bought this DVD set a couple of weeks ago and I must say that it has not left my DVD player since!  In my opinion, this is what \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" should have been!  I've had a ball watching Joe Walsh on this DVD.......he's hilarious!  All the classic songs (plus some new ones) are all here like \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" (absolutely one of my favorite Eagles hits), \\"Hotel California\\" and others.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to pick up a copy of this DVD!!!  You won't be disappointed!
1591840562|5.0|This is not a manual, but rather a collection of mostly useful tips for people who wish to start businesses, or even, as author Guy Kawasaki claims, other sorts of projects, including nonprofit organizations. Kawasaki may overuse business-babble such as \\"bootstrapping\\" or \\"rainmaking\\" (in fact, he recommends coming up with a brand name that can enter the language as a verb, such as Google or Xerox) - but his style is good-natured and humorous. The chapters are divided accessibly with subheads, charts, bullet points, \\"minichapters,\\" answers to \\"Frequently Avoided Questions\\" and reading lists, making it easy to find important points. Many of Kawasaki's \\"exercises\\" are tongue-in-cheek, like, \\"Go to eBay and search for used Aeron chairs.\\" He got his start working at Apple Computer, marketing early MacIntoshes, and he now runs a venture capital firm, Garage Technology Ventures. He refers to both frequently, and most of the book's examples come from these venues, not from inside knowledge of other start-ups, even though the author has been involved in several. This isn't the only book you'll need to read when you decide to start a business, but we find that its iconoclastic pointers are useful and fun, and its sections on pitching, recruiting and branding, in particular, apply to businesses of any size.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was never a fan of Buffy and Angel but you have to give Firefly it's due. Imaginative stories,wonderful flawed characters and for a change, a sense of humour! I caught the show by accident May 2005 and had heard of the reviews but was skeptical. I'm not the first to admit it but the show is bulls-eye!! Wow!!<br />The show takes place in the future with spaceships, heists, gunfights, lovable characters all done with top notch special effects.<br />Try it for yourselves and believe the hype!! I can't wait for the movie September 2005.
078681859X|5.0|I heartily enjoyed reading The Amulet of Samarkand by Jonathan Stroud. It is the first in the series and has created a world and characters that come alive when read. The fluidity and fast pacing of the book make the experience all the more enjoyable. <br /> <br />Nathaniel is a young 11 year old apprentice who seeks revenge on his master's friend for humiliating him at a party in front of numerous high ranking magicians. With the goal of revenge, Nathaniel thirsts for knowledge that his years won't allow him to learn, and so he turns to the wealth of knowledge that is his master's library. From the many books in the library, he finds Bartimaeus, an usually sneeky, smart and utterly hysterical (it is almost worth buying the book for his hysterics alone) djinni, to use in his plans for revenge. <br /> <br />Simon Lovelace, the source of the humiliation, is a powerful magician who only seeks more of what he already has. To get more power, he will try to use the Amulet of Samarkand and any other means necessary. <br /> <br />Both Nathaniel's thirst for revenge and Simon Lovelace's hunger for more power end up colliding, with Bartimaeus stuck squarely in the middle. This enjoyable tale will invigorate a dull weekend and have you looking forward to the next in line of what is to be the Bartimaeus Trilogy. I highly recommend it for young and old fans of literature alike, and especially fantasy lovers. Everyone enjoy!
B0006L5RT2|5.0|I'd not heard of James Blunt until one evening, listening to RTE2 on the internet they played one of his songs.  I became interested and ordered the Album.  I can listen to it over and over without stopping.  This doesn't happen often.I would like to have one complaint to file, in order to make this seem more balanced but quite frankly I have none.  I hope he keeps singing and writing for a long time.
1400032717|5.0|I just finished this book, and it's the best I've read in a while.  It's about a fifteen-year-old autistic savant named Christopher Boone who discovers that his neighbor's dog had been murdered and begins to investigate it.  When he finds out the truth about the doggie murder and other things, it sets him into a tailspin.  I give it 4  stars all-around, for both style and storyline. (Since I can only give whole stars, I had to round up - I normally don't give 5-star ratings, but 4 just doesn't do it justice!)  Haddon writes and gives insight into the main character's life in a way that Steve Martin did not in The Pleasure of My Company (a book that received much praise from critics but fell short of my high expectations), a book whose main character is not autistic but is also brilliant and has OCD.  The books beg comparison.  Read them both - you'll see what I mean.    I love that this story is told from the boy's point of view.  And there are some illustrations that help the reader imagine what is going through this boy's mind, but not so many that you're being inundated with them.  Another thing that strikes me was that Christopher and his parents are not tragic human beings.  Flawed, yes - who isn't? - but it's somewhat refreshing that the main character isn't portrayed as a victim.  Christopher is treated decently at his school, and his parents try their best - sometimes failing, sometimes getting it right.  Mark Haddon has really put the pressure on himself, making his debut novel hard to top.
B0009K7QZ8|3.0|***WARNING: Spoliers*** <br />The OC really strayed this second season . I think the main problem was creator Josh Shwartz left this season mostly up to new writers that terribly corrupted the show. Josh only wrote the first episode, the Rainy Day Women in the middle of the season, and the last story arc in the end of Season 2. <br />Anywho, ***THE STORY*** <br />The story from the beginning was silly. Ryan came back to Newport right away. Marissa has a little thing with Hispanic lawn guy. Lawn guy has no story or really any lines. He sillily acts along with Marissa who cries about crap. <br />Meanwhile, Seth-Summer-Zach triangle gets old and corny... and not the corny good. Seth was corny in Season 1, and we loved him for that, but this corny sucks. <br />Lesbianism between Alex and Marissa was neither hot, nor serious. In this situation, Marissa once again is shown as dumb and shallow little girl. Things went awry with Ryan, so she needs to experiment with Alex and actually live with the girl of which she then faces cleaning and paying rent. I was looking forward to the hookup, but unfortunately, teleplay and script never furnished a turn on. Pitiful. One Tree Hill did a much better, serious job with the lesbian issue. <br />Lindsay was such a nice girl. I liked her intelligent spunk. She went well with Ryan. They actually had good chemistry onscreen. However, writers shipped her off as well as other guest stars and even main stars! <br />Tate Donovan's leaving was a shame. Luckily he is back as a regular for next season. He has such a warmn character. <br />Meanwhile, both Sandy and Kirsten go off and be unfaithful and oblivious <br />The highpoint and redeeming part of the season, which showed a glimmer with Rainy Day Women midseason, began with the entrance of Trey, Ryan's brother. He added a freshness of character to the show. We wondered whether he was bad or not, just like Ryan felt. His crime against Marissa shocked us all, and the final confrontation between the two brothers was core TV at its best. Meanwhile, the climax of Kirsten's drinking problem was a stunner with the truck, and her sending off was quite moving. The intimate talk between Seth and Sandy showed finally that there was heart behind these characters, and that there was indeed a family. <br />***THE CAST*** <br />All the guest star either sucked or were given terrible story lines. DJ, the lawn boy, was nothing. Zach was just a corny, repetitively annoying nothing. Alex and Lindsay were decent, but then disappeared. <br />Ryan was a pale shadow of his former self. No more action for him. No longer the outsider, there was not real much imminent trouble for him, but we need that for the hero of the story. Also, aging must have done him badly. Already showing in Season 1, he has gained much facial weight. I suspect even bodily weight, too! When we first saw Ryan in Season 1, he has a nice, angular face. However, with Season 2, he no longer has that sleek body. I think he caught on, because he improved bodily for the finale. I think the problem was that he may have focused on lifting rather than running. Bad idea. Our hero does not need to be a body builder. <br />Marissa must not have been very enthusiastic this season, for her acting was terrible. Please recall when she made that silly scream and threw the chair into pool to tell Julie what she was feeling. It was real terrible. All Marissa did this season was whine, cry, or giggle. To add to that, she was not that hot anymore. The OC costume person needs to be fired. Season 1 had Marissa in all these designer clothes with tight, short skirts and such. This season had Marissa in punk clothes with ugly jeans and shirts. Her look was all off. When we first met Marissa, she had this mysterious aura about her --- a sexy look and glance. It is gone. What is also gone is that she has lost weight. Twigs are not good-looking. <br />Speaking of weight, Summer has also lost some. She has shrunken. When you lose weight, you lose it in ALL areas. Summer does not have that killer body she had in Season 1. Just compare the bathing suit scenes of Summer and Marissa from the two seasons. Anywho, with the story, Summer is not as interesting as she used to be. We need the bitch Summer aspect of her back. Characters are becoming too extremely one-dimensional on the show. <br />I would go more in depth with the other character, too, but I am lazy and this is already really long. I will make quick blurbs. <br />Kirsten has lost too much weight, too. old people should not be doing that. He face has imploded at the cheeks. <br />We need to see Sandy in the courtroom and not chasing after ugly women from his past. <br />Caleb was a great man. His last scene was beautifully done and moving. He was the last arch-nemesis on the OC. Julie was one last season, but now she has been made into a more likable character with soul. <br /> <br />***OVERALL + NEEDS + SEASON 3*** <br />Overall, Season 2 came out decent. I cannot forget the ugly first half, but neither can I forget the beautiful end. <br />It needs some new, colorful characters. Luke was a great character. Jimmy is back. Caleb was great as the antagonist. That is the thing with stories. There needs to be antagonists and protagonists. Everybody is becoming or became a protagonist. Luke, Julie, and now Caleb is dead. Who is the ass/bitch to come? <br />What was so great about Season 1 was the satire of the rich life. We see no intelligent satire or quip this season. We need to get to school as the story. Seth needs to become the nerd to be in the element that we love him for. We saw just a glimpse in the prom episode where some faceless guy in the crowd cried, \\"Seth Cohen is a tool.\\" That was awesome. We need a return to the superficial rich (and hot) people and parties (with scantily clad, drunk girls) of the OC. That is what it is all about. Also, the kids are kids. They need to go to school. Not lumber around with their lesbians and such. <br />Season 3 holds great promise building on the momentum from the finale and the base from Season 1. The Theresa/Ryan's baby story can be quite good if it is done right. Sandy and Kirsten can become the lovable couple again. Anywho, sorry for the long review, and make sure you at least own Season 1. That is the best, and watch this promising show.
B000002N2P|1.0|This CD is horrible. My mom bought it for me and I thought it was going to be good like the American Idiot album. It was good at first but then when on the second minute of the first track, I felt the need to turn off the DVD Player which I used to play the CD.
044024157X|4.0|John G. has done a good job in this novel in the descriptions of the characters and area that places you right into the story.  The wit and plot twists keep you laughing to yourself & guessing what is coming next. <br />I read this on a cross country flight & the time just flew by. <br />Highly recommended! <br />
1400032717|4.0|I picked this book up on a whim, not really expecting much, and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise!  I thought I was going to be reading a mystery and ended up finding a story that made me take the time to evaluate my opinion of mental disabilities.  The book opened my eyes to the ridged world of autism (a disability I had no interest in before reading the book) and gave me an appreciation for those suffering with the  disability and their caregivers that I never had before.  It's a quick read . . . which is good because once you pick it up you won't want to put it down.  Is this deep literature?  No.  Is it a well thought out, delivered and entertaining book?  Absolutely.
B000002KOQ|4.0|(4.5 Stars) <br /> <br />After two albums of just Joni and an acoustic guitar, this is a welcome progression! Not a huge change, but she's added different colors to her musical palette.  <br /> <br />The biggest change is that Joni has now added the piano to her repetoir. And not just one song..she performs 5 out of the 12 songs solely on piano (and another with an electic piano). She's good too..she obviously didn't start playing it in the short time between \\"Clouds\\" and this album's release (or did she??). <br /> <br />Anyway, the piano adds a whole new dimension to her music. It sounds icy and beautiful, and certainly suits certain songs better than her usual acoustic guitar accompanyment. For instance, \\"Blue Boy\\", \\"Willy\\", and \\"Rainy Night House\\". All performed by Joni on piano, and it helps give the song a desolate feel. Her singing is so beautiful that there's no need for any additional instrumentation. <br /> <br />However, she does slip some in. \\"For Free\\" (another piano based number - absolutely wonderful lyrics and melody. One of Joni's best songs) features a cello, as well as a clarinet solo at the end. They both add a subtle, colorful touch to the song without overpowering it.  <br /> <br />\\"Conversation\\" is an acoustic guitar led song (with more great lyrics about a love triangle of sorts) with a cool melody; it also features some woodwind flourishes towards the end (flute and saxophone, to be precise). <br /> <br />The opener, \\"Morning Morgantown\\" and the title track are both folky numbers with enchanting, inviting melodies. Nearly all of these songs are inviting, even though many are downbeat and lonely. In that sense, this album really set the stage for her masterpiece \\"Blue\\". Sure, it's pretty depressing..but the melodies and singing are so memorable that you get lost in all of the music and emotion.  <br /> <br />Only \\"The Priest\\" harkens back to songs like \\"The Pirate of Penance\\" or \\"Roses Blue\\" from her first couple albums. It's really brooding and serious, but the melody isn't very inviting (even though it's lyrically interesting). <br /> <br />On the other hand, the piano-led \\"Arrangement\\" is just as serious and grave..but it's instantly memorable! The first time you hear it, you can't help but say \\"WOW\\". The way she alternates from singing in her lower register, then jumping up to a higher octave (on the piano) and her soaring, beautiful falsetto..then back again. It's utterly fantastic. It fits in great on here, but would also fit perfectly on her next album \\"Blue\\". <br /> <br />The holy-grail triad for many listeners is the last three songs: \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", \\"Woodstock\\", and \\"The Circle Game\\". Respectively, they're the three most well known and popular songs on here. Everyone has heard \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" (whether Joni's version, or the countless other people who have covered it). It's catchy, and shows that Joni can have fun too. A simple, perfect pop song. <br /> <br />\\"Woodstock\\" is more popular due to the Crosby Stills & Nash (& Young?) version. Joni wrote it though, and this is her version. VASTLY different! She performs this on electic piano, giving it the most haunting, raw, mysterious feel. Most people perfer the CSN(Y) version. It's just so much more accessible, as they turned it into a rather catchy, upbeat pop number. <br /> <br />They're so vastly different, it's hard to even say \\"Well, this one is better\\". They're both excellent, in much different ways. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"The Circle Game\\". Joni had written this years before, and now does her own rendition. This has to be one of the best folk songs ever. Beautiful lyrical sentiment (the passage of time), beautiful melody, beautiful everything. What else can I say? <br /> <br />So, why only 4.5 stars? Well, I keep mentioning \\"Blue\\". That was the follow-up to this album, and it's an utter masterpiece. I'm tempted to give this 5 stars, but \\"Blue\\" is even better. And that's saying a lot, because \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\" is an incredible album. Certainly Joni's first classic/essential/whatever you wan't to call it. Buy it now!
B000002KOJ|4.0|Joni Mitchell's second album \\"Clouds\\" is not much of an evolution from her debut. Much like \\"Song to a Seagull\\", don't expect any full band numbers on here. These songs involve Joni playing her acoustic guitar and singing - and that's it. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the songwriting is a tad bit stronger this time around. The opener \\"Tin Angel\\" is not very inviting at first due to its depressing, minor-key arrangement. However, it becomes intriguing with repeated listens. Like another reviewer cleverly pointed out, as she sings the line \\"I found someone to love today\\", the minor chord resolves to its respective major, giving the song a brief feeling of hope. <br /> <br />With that said, Joni is a master of creating a mood based on the songs lyrical tone. And she does it all with a single guitar. For instance, the \\"Chelsea Morning\\" is a bouncy, upbeat, happy folk song. Certainly the most accessible thing on here. <br /> <br />\\"I Don't Know Where I Stand\\" is probably my favorite on here, with its introspective lyrics, and beautiful melodies. Also terrific is the dreamy \\"Song About the Midway\\", and the introspective \\"I Think I Understand\\". <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Roses Blue\\" (in which Joni sings about some sort of fortune teller) and \\"Song to Aging Children\\" are like \\"Nathan La Franeer\\" and \\"The Pirate of Penance\\" from her debut. Both ultra-serious compositions with some unfriendly chord changes throughout. They're interesting, but not easy to get into. Also, if you dislike a-capella pieces, you probably won't like \\"The Fiddle and the Drum\\". Joni's voice is so good though, that it works for the most part.  <br /> <br />The closing song, \\"Both Sides Now\\", is the most well known song on this album (along with \\"Chelsea Morning\\", both of which were covered by Judy Collins). It's a simple folk song, with a couple effective lyrical switches. One of Joni's most beloved songs, and for good reason I suppose. <br /> <br />\\"Clouds\\" is not entirely essential by any means, but it'sa very good album. It's a bit more accessible than her debut album, and better for it.
B000002KHH|5.0|basically this is just a great cd released by a great band. the drummer is incredibal and it really shows in rat salad with his drum solo. now that i have mentioned solos, there are also incredible guitar solos throught the entire cd. besides all that, the great guitar riffs on almost every song (but the best are paranoid and ironman) and ozzys eerie vocals help carry you from song to song on this great album that you will find yourself listening to over and over again.  <br /> <br />this is THE band that influenced all metal and some of the greatest metal cds. if you like metal you have to see where it all started and you will defidently not be dissapointed. not only that, it has some of the best metal songs ever written. as usual i like to rate them; <br /> <br />war pigs 9-10 ozzys eerie voice and lyrics help this song along. even though i gave it a 9 it is 1 of their best songs but if i gave everthing a 10 it would be 2 easy. <br /> <br />paranoid 10-10 this is 1 of the 2 songs that i will give a 10. the guitar riffs are amazong and i love ozzys voice. they cram all this incredible material into a song under 3 minutes long.  <br /> <br />planet caravan 6-10 a good song mainly because of ozzys eerie vocals. defidently not the best song on the album. <br /> <br />iron man 10-10 how can you turn this song down. the greatest metal song ever WRITTEN. this is one of the best songs. it has great riffs, great drumming, and great lyrics, what else can i say? <br /> <br />electric funeral 8-10 ozzys eerie vocals really shine in this song accompanied by great guitar riffs and an addicting chorus this is one of the better songs on this cd.  <br /> <br />hand of doom 7-10 this song grows on you. it has great drumming and creepy lyrics. <br /> <br />rat salad 7.5/10 wow, the best drum solo ive ever heard, the drummer completely looses it. this is one of the craziest songs ive ever heard. <br /> <br />faries wear boots 8/10 great song. ozzys vocals are great and eerie again and it is the perfect song to end the cd with. what more can you ask for. <br /> <br />overall if your looking for metal in its finest form, look here. this cd pack some of the greatest music in in under 1 hour. dont pass up the chance to buy this cd. \\"heavy boots of lead fills his victims full of dread\\"

B000929AJQ|5.0|the best nin song ever. i just love trent's music. this is their most abstract cd.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Now, I understand that it is a movie and space must be sacred and words will be changed but come on! Lord of the Rings was way long and we loved it.  There was just way too much left out of the Movie.  My friend (who has not read the books) was peeved to say the least that I stopped the movie 10-15 times to explain what was missing or changed.  So numerous, I mean really was the whomping willow in that spot in the last movie, or even Hagrid's for that matter?  Was Hermione not with him when the dementors came, what about the conflict between Ron and Hermione?  It just scares me that if they made that many changes and left out that much on this movie what does the next one hold for us.  I finished this movie VERY dissapointd but still loving the series. I will watch every one that comes out but if I was upset over this one what does the next hold.  Still worth a watch but a sad effort in my opinion.
B00005JNSK|3.0|Sterile is the one word I would use to sum up Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We never really get to know any of the characters in the story in a deep or meaningful way. In fact, the children are presented so matter of factly that the viewer feels indifference toward their impending plight. Johnny Depp does a decent job as a somewhat dark, disturbed version of Willie Wonka. His quips to the children are funny but in most cases he is guilty of overacting. The best parts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are the flashbacks to Charlie's childhood. Here we learn about his father, Wilbur Wonka (played to perfection by Christopher Lee)  who is a dentist with an extreme dislike for any type of candy. The viewer also glimpses how Willie Wonka met and recruited the Oompa Loompa's to come and work in his factory which is an interesting side bar. I don't know, call me nostalgic but this version couldn't hold a candle to the original. Gene Wilder was absolute perfection and although Depp handles the role, this is clearly not one of his shining screen moments. I can relate to  Tim Burton's vision but to me there's just not enough heart in this one to make it a winner. Recommended(Barely).
0143034901|5.0|I thought this book was amazing.  Funny also.  From all of my reading, it's very difficult to make a novel humorous and it managed to do so.  It is very romantic and tragic and all of the things that made me keep turning the pages.  Some things were predictable, but I've found that in many books there is some predictability, but the art comes in how it's written, the characters are their lives, and their habits.  This book made me want to continue my desire to write, and to read.  I highly recommend this book!
B000002KBU|5.0|If you ask many Joni Mitchell fans what her best album is, they'll tell you \\"Blue\\" for sure. In fact, this has to be one of the greatest singer/songwriter albums of all time.    In many ways, this is the last Joni Mitchell album of its kind. Like the three albums that preceeded this, these songs are very spare. Don't expect any beefy, full band arrangements. She does get some help (James Taylor adds guitar on a couple tracks, Stephen Stills plays bass on one, Russ Kunkel adds percussion to a couple), but it's still very stark and confessional. However, even though it's has a sad, desolate feel most of the time, this is Joni's strongest set of melodies yet. There's some really great pop hooks on here, believe it or not.     \\"All I Want\\" is as good as you'd want an opening song to be. Joni plays the dulcimer and guitar, and it's an utter, hypnotizing rush for the listener. It's urgent, exciting, *catchy*. With the exception of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", this was the first Joni Mitchell song I'd ever heard..and it left me saying \\"Wow, I think I'm onto something really special here!\\".     Her singing is also in top form here, ranging from her normal voice to swirling falsetto. \\"My Old Man\\" is a great showcase of someone who can really sing. Joni plays the piano here, and it's her most ambitious piano-led song yet. There's a key change for the bridge, and even some tasteful use of dissonance. Her singing on this song is incredible.    \\"Little Green\\" is the closest thing to folk on here; it's also pretty old, written in 1967, compared to 1971 for all the other songs. So it has that older Joni feel, but it still fits in; it's delicate and beautiful.    The title track is a beautiful song, just Joni playing melancholy piano and singing. In fact, all 4 of the piano based songs on here are the same way - no other instruments.    She has also crafted two blissfully perfect pop songs in \\"Carey\\" and \\"California\\". It's hard to say which one is catchier, but it doesn't matter. They also both feature light percussion, which is a rare beast in Joni's first few albums.    The brooding \\"This Flight Tonight\\" is another real rush, with Joni strumming her heart out, and really rocking out acoustically. It's the fastest, most urgent thing on here, and it's terrific.    The melancholy \\"River\\" is probably the most covered song on here if I had to guess. I actually heard Barry Manilow's version before I knew Joni Mitchell wrote it. Do I have to dignify whose version is better? Another gorgeous, poignant piano ballad. Just Joni and the piano; that's all it needs.    Apparently, \\"A Case of You\\" is one of Joni's most beloved songs. It's a really great love song based on one of her most clever metaphors. Great guitar playing, amazing singing..a lot to love here. Even Prince did a jazzy cover of it a few years back.    \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" is the final song on here, and it's another great piano-led number. Joni's piano playing isn't what you'd call 'technically advanced' or real diverse, but she has a distinct style that works perfectly. And that's not to say that she isn't good, because she is definetly skilled.     If you don't know anything about Joni Mitchell, start here. It shattered a lot of myths for me. It hooked me right away. I thought Joni's music was lightweight, flower power hippie folk dreck. Boy, was I ignorant. This is not folk. Pop? A little. Rock? Yes, a couple of these songs genuinely rock..and without any electric guitars or drums. Brilliant? Yes, most of all.    Favorites: The Last Time I Saw Richard, Little Green, This Flight Tonight, A Case of You.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I found the movie both very well made and it kept my attotion. It did not quite follow the book, the changes made to the movie did not change the story or the full impact of the story ,in fact I belive they made it make more sence then if they had not been made. <br />Over all it was the best I am very glad I have it now. <br />
0553381407|4.0|For me this book is an introduction to various family phenomena, and once your specific situation is focused on, another book must be bought, but still it is necessary to read it to get a frame for family interactions and better understand your own.
0596007124|5.0|This book is very well written, fun, and easy to understand. I really recommend this if you want to learn design patterns. I even would suggest this book in preference to the original Design Patterns book by Erich Gamma et al, which was also excellent but never updated to use UML class diagrams.
B000687M48|5.0|When I first listed to the tracks, I was annoyed to find that they were all taken from a live performance in Paris. The crowd noise was initially distracting until I got comfortable with the fact that that \\"noise\\" added a distinct energy to the cd, that I now love. I'm glad they were bold enough to record almost the entire cd this way. I can't imagine it as all studio cuts. Bravo!!! It Rocks!
B000646MNE|5.0|I believe over all, this is a must for any die hard SEX AND THE CITY fan. Sure there is a season that may not keep up with the rest but,over all. Great. Sex..is one series I can watch repeatedly and never grow tired. Its and excellent way to get  <br />your fix. Yes it is almost like an addiction for me. If you're a single woman there is so much you can identify with. So what if we can all afford the lifestyle, there is many similarities. Go out and get it. One note. The price on Amazon is great compared to trying to buy it retail.
B0000CEB62|3.0|[...]  Here is the list of songs included in the \\"uninterupted\\" concert (Only 12 of 20 songs on the CDs) in order of appearance: Master and Servant, Pimpf, Behind the Wheel, Strangelove (missing the middle verse - ouch), Blaspemous Rumours, Stripped, Somebody, Black Celebration (end faded out), Pleasure Little Treasure (beginning faded in), Just Can't get Enough (end faded out), Everything Counts (beginning faded in), and Never Let Me Down Again (beginning quickly faded in).  The total play time not including credits is 51:36.    My expectations were set artificially high and unfortunately not met.  The rest of the reviews cover everything else you need to know.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I was suprised at just how great Judas Priest's new album really is. Judas Priest hasn't lost the magic that made them great more than 30 years ago. I had the pleasure of seeing them live a couple m onths ago and it was like they hadn't aged one bit. Judas Rising, Revolution, and Deal With the Devil are my favorite hard songs on this album and I also really like Worth Fighting For. The DVD also has some great interviews and stuff so this set is a really good deal. If you are a new Judas Priest fan or an old one this album really lives up to the standards set by Screaming for Vengeance and Hell Bent for Leather and if you are looking for some new good metal this is the album for you.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is truly the most underrated Pink Floyd album, and one of the best it is my personal favroite.  Buy it now!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I was doubtful about this album because I'm not an enourmous fan of their debut album. I wasn't sure if this would be anymore than a swear-fest but I was wrong. It is a great album that really shows how much System of a Down has progressed. Not only thta but it gave me a new look on their debut and I like that album a lot more now. Serj has a one of a kind voice and if you haven't heard it I highly recommend picking up this disc.    My favorite three track on the album are B.Y.O.B., Question, and Sad Statue. Question has a really strange ending but it works out for them and its an entertaining album. SOAD is a lot better than most nu-metal bands in the fact that they actually sing. Not only that but Serj can actually sing well.     The Tracks:    1. Soldier Side - Intro   2. B.Y.O.B.   3. Revenga   4. Cigaro   5. Radio/Video   6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song   7. Violent Pornography   8. Question!   9. Sad Statue   10. Old School Hollywood   11. Lost in Hollywood     Typical System antics and old fans will be happy and igf you're a fan of nu-metal or you've never heard of them you should should buy this album it's a great addition to your collection.
B0000013GT|5.0|Rating: A+ <br />Its been almost ten years since Outkast released their sophmore followup to SouthernPlayalisticCadillacMusic, and this album only gets better with each listen every single day. Quite possibly one of the most flawless rap records ever put out, Outkast's ATLiens is right up there with Enter the 36 Chambers, Reasonable Doubt, and Dre2001, as some of the best rap albums of all time. Although Aquemini has some extremely great tracks and funny@$$ skits, ATLiens is straight to the point as Big Boi and Andre3000 have propelled their style and flows into outer-space with this album, stepping up past the tight flows and beats from their prvious effort and showing everyone how to make a classic album in the process. While radio singles like Elevator's earned Outkast a spot on mainstream radio solidifying their reputation, it is with tracks like Jazzy Belle, Babylon, Mainstream, and Millenium that Outkast truly show how much they can make a song shine. However, these are not the only great tracks on this album, as truly you can pop the cd in let it ride and just bask in the atmosphere and vibe permited from this perfect album. Subsequent releases by the dynamic duo were excellent as well but this album showed Big Boi and Andre in their prime unafraid of what to say and do, creating a landmark classic that few can argue will ever get old.

B000929VKO|5.0|When my daughter came over to visit, she suggested that we rent this film. Since it stars Samuel L. Jackson and is about a high school basketball coach, I thought that it sounded promising. Well, it turned to be more than just promising. It is a movie that held me riveted to the screen the entire time it was on. Samuel L. Jackson is simply outstanding in the role of a high school coach who sees basketball as the means to an end and not the end itself.<br /><br />Based upon a true story that took place in Richmond, California, it centers on a man named Ken Carter. He was asked by the retiring basketball coach of Richmond High School to return as a part-time basketball coach to the school from which Ken had graduated and left his mark many years earlier. The school is one of those schools in which people barely graduate and, of those that do, most do not go on to college. The basketball team was no great shakes either, having won only four games in the entire previous year.<br /><br />Finally, Carter is prevailed upon to take over as coach. He has, however, decided that he wants to make a difference. He starts off by letting the team know who is boss and by trying to instill discipline and respect. He wants to go back to fundamentals. He wants to put the emphasis  on being  a student athlete. To this end, he makes it clear just what his expectations are. He drafts a contract that those who wish to remain on the team, as well as their parent,  must sign. Some of the conditions are that  the players must attend class, do their schoolwork, and pass their classes. Those who signed the contract ended up making  the best move of their lives.<br /><br />Coach Carter keeps his side of the bargain, turning the team into a formidable one on the court. Suddenly, basketball at Richmond High School begins commanding attention. Notwithstanding this, he still emphasizes that they are to be just as committed to their studies. While one might expect some resistance from the student athletes to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves. What is amazing is the resistance that he experiences from the teaching community who are reluctant to give him progress reports on how his players were doing academically.<br /><br />When Coach Carter finally gets his long awaited progress reports and discovers that some of his student athletes are not holding up their end of the contract, all hell breaks loose. Even though they have had an undefeated season so far, he basically locks the gym and tells his players that there will be no more basketball, until he sees some academic improvement. To his surprise, the school board,  as well as the parents, does not support him in this matter, and the situation becomes a media sensation on the West Coast. Support comes from an unexpected source, the student athletes themselves.<br /><br />This is a heartwarming story about a coach who cared and dared to make a difference in the lives of kids that had little or no future. What he did for those students was incomparable, as he basically gave them a chance for a better life. Samuel L. Jackson is sensational as Coach Carter, dynamic and totally believable in the role. The young men who play his student athletes likewise give excellent performances. Ashanti also gives a surprisingly well nuanced performance as the girlfriend of one of the student athletes. Moreover, for those who enjoy great basketball, the on court scenes are extremely well done.<br /><br />At the end of the film, there is a summary of what happened to these young men. When the viewer sees what happened to them, the viewer cannot help  be but touched by the turn of events. This is a very well acted, deftly directed,  inspirational film and one that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.hletes to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves.

B00005JN4H|3.0|This movie is another proof that a comedy does not have to be plausible or even have a good plot to make us laugh.  To keep this kind of silliness in the air the movie depends on the delight created by the stars.  Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon bring energy and fun to this lame brained comedy.  From the opening bicycle messenger sequence under the titles to the very last outtake there is nothing in this movie that makes much sense let alone a speck of plausibility.<br /><br />Yet, you just like watching Queen Latifah occupying the screen.  Yes, we would like watching her all the more in a better movie, but sometimes it is OK to have fun being silly.  Her souped up taxi is silly, that she can zoom through downtown traffic is silly, that Fallon could be a cop with all his foibles is even sillier, and there is a lot more in this movie that is even dumber including the Super Villains being attracted to bank robbing.  Fallon is not as delightful as Queen Latifah, but makes his feckless cop into someone you almost care about.  He and Queen Latifah do have some chemistry as a comedy team.<br /><br />But who cares?  This is not a movie about realism.  It is playing pretend and setting up silly situations that we can laugh at.  That Ann Margret as Fallon's constantly intoxicated mom can make drunkenness funny at all is an achievement in today's MADD world.<br /><br />If you want to turn off your brain for a bit and understand that all your enjoyment will be destroyed the moment your plausibility circuitry evaluates anything you are seeing on the screen, this should work for you.  If you can't then this is a one or two star movie that will drive you crazy.  In either case, you won't remember much about it the day after you watch it.
B00092ZL80|5.0|OK. I haven't seen the DVD.<br /><br />BUT I just saw Chicago and EWF in concert, doing the same show. All I can say is that if the CD has half the energy and technical perfection of the show, this is one heckuva of a product!<br /><br />Chicago and EWF are at that awkward age. With half their members still alive and blowing, they are somewhere halfway between a tribute band and the finest incarnation of their young selves. On stage, the members of each band seem to be having the time of their lives. And why not? 30 years after their heyday, they are still popular, still bringing their fans in by the thousands. The audience shouts their lyrics back at them, hums along with their well-worn brass breaks and cheers for every opening riff. Both bands are down to half their original strength, but the cross-pollination has done wonders for both. The bands play together and apart, feeding off each other and the audience, helping us all forget our troubles for a few sweet hours.<br /><br />Don't make any mistake: I missed some of their founding members. Terry Kath, Peter Cetera, Danny Seraphine and Maurice White have either gone to the big gig in the sky or moved on to other projects and careers. But both bands have managed to keep fresh songs that have been overplayed by FM radio almost to the point of clich&eacute;, making these old chestnuts fun, with new arrangements and plain old fashioned energy.<br /><br />A sure bet to make you smile ;-)
0380002930|5.0|As always being an very avid bookworm, (even long before kindergarten) I hereby state that anyone who has not read or who doesn't own this superb novel should either be arrested or deemed to pay a very high fine!! (Lol! just kidding!)  At 30 years of age, I remember vividly reading this novel as a freshman in high school for English on a mandatory basis.  I was immediately spellbinded from start to finish.  Gloriously written with the use of very picturesque words which ignite happiness, fear, and sorrow, this novel is truly indeed one that is not meant to be banned or ignored.  Even though it illustrates life and the world as viewed from animalistic perception, please DO NOT immediately assume that it is a children's book!  In reality, it is meant for anyone who is 12 years of age and over. <br />
0757302661|5.0|I love the new edition of this book. It is far more interesting, entertaining and complete than the last edition. I especially like Dr. Lorne Campbell's letter at the beginning of the book which details how he went from a 25% c-section rate to a 1% (yes - 1%- that is not a typo) c-section rate after making some changes with his practice. The most major change he made of course was using HypnoBirthing.  <br /> <br />Reading this book will be a very effective way of getting rid of any fear that you may have of childbirth. The first edition of this book completely changed my life and my children truly owe their lives to it. Before this book there was no way I would have ever considered getting preganant or giving birth. I was too afraid of birth. <br /> <br />So what will you learn? I can't do it justice in this review. It isn't only about self-hypnosis. That is only a small part of the HypnoBirthing classes and book. You will learn other tools like breathing (that actually works during birth), birth plans, laws of the mind, exercises, choosing a caregiver, how to avoid artifical inductions, c-section, nutrition, and much more.  <br /> <br />The book also comes with a Hypnosis for Childbirth CD. <br /> <br />Yes, I have given birth using this method. My daughter is now three and I had almost no discomfort during birth. I love giving birth now. By the way, I also used the hypnosis technique's at this dentist. I had a several fillings that had to be re-done. I only used hypnosis and had no pain.  <br /> <br />Sheri Menelli, speaker, author, childbirth educator, mother
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I don't know what the hell some of these people are smoking but this CD is amazing. And the whole thing about the lack of screaming: M. Shadows had vocal chord surgery!!! He can't do it anymore. This may be different from the A7X we are used to but in my opinion they've just gotten better. Forget about image and how hardcore a band is and recognize talent when you here it. A7X is bringing back the kind of metal that we've needed for so long. With the amazing drum beats and guitar solos how can't you like this. Anyone who claims not to like this is too bent up on image and wouldn't know good music is it bit them in the @ss.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|Carla Bruni will lull you with her magical lyrics and amazing and unique voice, which seems to be the voice of love. I have shared this CD with all my friends and impressed those with the highest of musical taste. This album is a major find!
B00006LPEY|4.0|When I first heard friend and the UK press banging on about this movie back in 1994, I thought it was worth a look. <br /> <br />Upon first viewing I did feel slightly confused as it didn't seem to be the whole story as described.  As it turned out the Anime and Manga are totally different animals. <br /> <br />The manga actually does feature Akira in a key role, whereas the film (planned while the manga series was still running in Japan) removes any real direct involvement he has in the story. <br /> <br />Opting instead for the story of Tetsuo Shima.  Telling the tale of his rather awkward angst-ridden teenage rebellion against powers and situations beyond his control. <br /> <br />Chances are, Americans will love the last action-packed 30 minutes with its' guns, mutation, death and mass destruction.   <br /> <br />But in my humble opinion the manga presents us with a fully developed world and each of our lead character's individual story arcs are given satisfying conclusions - and so is vastly superior to this over-rated, much hyped piece of Japanese Popular Culture and Animated Action Cinema.  There simply isn't enough time to give Otomo's post-apocalyptic world the time and attention needed to grab an increasingly restless, impatient modern audience. <br /> <br />I was 14 when I first saw the Streamline Pictures dub (still included on the most recent Region 2 UK and Region 4 Australian releases) and it took me several viewings to truly understand all aspects of Otomo's multi-layered film version of Akira.  Over the years my appreciation for this smaller scaled story has increased steadily.   As I matured, so did my tastes in movies. <br /> <br />The Geneon/Pioneer 2001 dub is truer to the original script but totally unnecessary.  Akira is best enjoyed in Japanese with the new Subs. <br /> <br />I actually have three slightly different subbed versions: The Manga/Island World Communications UK VHS, The BBC broadcast version (not too different from the video) andthe Pioneer Literal Translation Script of the Japanese (used for the Region 1, 2 & 4 DVD releases). <br /> <br />You really are best revisiting the movie once you have read the Manga.  I guarantee you will come back to the anime version with a deeper understanding of the intricate plot. <br /> <br />To all those who want a throw-away movie experience - go watch a Poke'mon movie instead. <br /> <br />If you can you should Import the Region 2 UK version (available from amazon.co.uk) with the old dub on a second disc with the 4:3 video transfer plus Dolby digital 2.0 Dual Mono (Front Left Channel & Right Channels - no surround sound) or the Madman Entertainment single disc Region 4 version with all 3 audio tracks on the same disc with the 2001 Pioneer Widescreen Re-mastered Version. <br /> <br />The 2 disc American releases have more extras (on the restoration and re-dubbing, plus capsule option - translation of Japanese signs and graffiti) if you like that kind of thing. <br /> <br />Happy viewing!! <br />
B000002I8D|3.0|I don't understand why Phil Collins chose to re-shoot the cover images. Clearly time and poor health have taken their toll on him. But, the 30 year old man that recorded Face Value is not the same, highly-creative person that's on the new cover. Most disturbingly, despite a bonus CD, the bonus material is slim. Although I like the demo versions, missing is the single version of &#34;In The Air Tonight&#34; [with extra tom tom] and other, non-album demos.  [DW]
0425152251|4.0|This is one of the best novels I have read!  It has a great plot and theme, with a lot of philosophical history.  Together the philosophy and the story really make you ponder the true meaning of life, as well as knowing what truly is REALITY.  The long lectures in philosophy at the beginning might seem boring, but hang on, you won't regret it!
0312857063|5.0|This is as good as it gets!  I just finished this book and am tempted to read it again.  Terry Goodkind has another hit on his hand.  For most of the book I have read the second is nowhere as good as the first, well Goodkind proved me wrong.  Better then the first on this book devolges so much more about the personality of the char.  and how the rest of the series will be.  I highly encourage you all to read this book it will leave you asking for more.
0060974176|5.0|This book is probably the best book on the automobile industry with respect to the rise and fall of the American and European auto manufacturers vis-a-vis the Japanese. While the Americans have made great strides in recent years the roots of their near demise are clearly exposed in this book. Some European manufacturers have learned from their mistakes but many have not and still produce cars that are more fabled than truly well designed and executed. The English auto industry took this to their grave. The Germans are still struggling to get their cars to equal their price premium in all respects not just performance or handling. In the end the Japanese have taught the whole world what it takes to deisgn and build a car.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|After that awful ToT, this is a definitive and mature peak of DT's writing and performance abilities, the creative and progressive essence of the band. This is truly magnificent and one of my favorite recording by the band. Stunning work with jaw-dropping performances and great writing. All the songs are fantastic. This is a masterpiece.  <br />
B000957O82|4.0|I knew he could do it. Will Smith is suave and sexy-- of course he can do a romantic comedy. Smith stars as Alex Hitchens, aka Hitch, the date doctor. He helps otherwise helpless guys find true love in only three dates. Hitch won't help just anybody. He's strictly off the radar and can only be found through referral. Hitch's clientel are men who want the real deal, not just a one night stand.  <br /> <br />The movie centers around Hitch and one of his clients named Albert (played by the hilarious Kevin James). Albert wants to date supermodel Allegra Cole. Hitch thinks this is crazy, but agrees to help, knowing how passionate Albert is about her. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a woman named Sara, who is a gossip columnist. This spells disaster already. Sara doesn't understand what Allegra Cole could possibly see in a dowdy, clutzy guy like Albert. Little does she know that the guy she's been seeing is the famed date doctor.  <br /> <br />It's a romantic comedy, so it's fairly predictable. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Will Smith is wonderful, come on, you knew he would be. Can't really expect less from Will Smith... we'll just forget about Wild Wild West... Kevin James is so funny; I couldn't believe how many times his Trying-To-Act-Cool-But-Being-A-Total-Clutz routine had me laughing out loud. This is such a fun movie, a great date movie... wow, I'd even say a perfect date movie. Maybe guys can pick up a few tips from Hitch. Then again, are there really any rules?! RECOMMENDED!!!
B000002KHH|5.0|First of all if it wasn't for Black Sabbath then most likely there would be no metal today. Although Black Sabbath wasn't the earliest metal band (that would be Deep Purple) they still added many new twists to the genre. This band was dark, eerie, and definitely evil (for its time, anyway) and in Paranoid people started getting into this growing genre. <br />  While Deep Purple provided the loudness and Led Zeppelin provided the attitude, Black Sabbath brought the evil into metal. Songs like 'Electric Funeral', 'Hand of Doom', and 'Planet Caravan' explain such evil. Popular songs like 'Paranoid' and 'Iron Man' brought catchiness to Black Sabbath, while still maintaining complexity and talent. Other songs, such as 'Fairies Wear Boots' start out with only instruments and then has Ozzy come in with his eerie vocals. 'War Pigs' has lyrics about Vietnam (keep in mind this was made in '70). Tony Iommi is among the best guitarists ever. The guy lost many fingertips in an accident at a Birmingham factory. While most guitarists would probably quit right there Iommi didn't only continue, but excell. Geezer Butler is a fast-as-hell bassist who laid the foundation for many metal bassists. Bill Ward is a decent drummer, and although he never came close to Jon Bonham from Zeppelin, he still provided the backbone to Sabbath. We all know about Ozzy and his eerie vocals/lyrics, I shouldn't need to write anything. <br />  If you like rock n' roll, then you should already have this. If you dont, well I shouldn't have to tell you anything now.

B00005JNJT|5.0|This was not a movie I was going to see, after all my friends raved about it, I found myself in a San Fernando Valley Cineplex, riveted to the chair.  I thought the movie was fantastic.  I really love Christopher Nolan's work, and think the cast is amazing.  I am not terribly sure I can be that analytical about it.  I just know I was gripped by it.  Here are a couple of thoughts...<br /><br />The journey.......yes, we are used to a darker Batman now.  Truly the years of \\"bang\\" \\"zowie\\" and Julie Newmar as the catwoman(and Liberace as a guest villian) are over.  Batman has been dark for a long time...and all this stuff about Batman being so dark should exist only in conversations over old Green Hornet reruns..But what seems to be important , more than the darkness, is the journey.  This deals with a real person, a tortured billionaire who abandons money for searching...and then comes back.  This is a story...a story of a journey, and quite effective.<br /><br />The cast...Ok, how great is Morgan Freeman?  Yeah, he is often Morgan Freeman, but who the hell cares.  The supporting cast is brilliant.  Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy(creepy creepy pretty boy), Tom Wilkinson...Ok, I had never seen Katie Holmes in anything, and she wasn't so great in my opinion, but I am sure in the right vehicle(and I don't mean  on the back of Tom's Motorcyle) she is great.<br /><br />  But let's rave a little about Christian Bale.  He is, in my opinion, on a level with Johnny Depp for risky work.  He is so fun to watch.  You never know where he is going, he keeps you on guard, but ultimately he pulls out a rich, nuanced performance.<br /><br />Finally, lets applaud a piece that is nuanced itself.  Funny at times, couched in relationship and history rather than just bloodshed, filled with action...rooted in story.  And...again...it dares to be different.  I mean, let's face it, we all have our opinions...so it boils down to what you want..  If you want a story well told, using heroes and villians as a way of getting to the pain of loss, in a world devoid of a lot of light...this is definitely one for you...oes and villians as a way of getting to the pain of loss, in a world devoid of a lot of light...this is definitely one for you...
B0009XNUK0|4.0|For true MJ fans this doesn't have anything new and many will be annoyed at how old favorites have been shortened or otherwise edited.  However, for the casual listener looking for a comprehensive MJ greatest hits album this is a good bet.  It is one of the most complete greatest hits efforts, including early motown hits all the way through You Rock My World (although some very big hits are left off, like Dancing Machine and Earth Song).  If you are only looking for Michael's adult hits, then I would recommend History: Greatest Hits Vol I, instead.  For the more serious fan, try the Ultimate Collection which includes 4 discs of his hits songs (including many previously unreleased tracks that could have been big hits if they had made it onto an album) and a live concert dvd that shows Michael in his element--live performance.
B0007GAERG|3.0|I enjoyed the first 2 songs on the album a lot. The rest was mediocre to bad. There's something about It's Like That and We Belong Together that gets you dancing and grooving, the rest is so-so.  <br /> <br />This winds up being another one of those albums where only one or 2 songs are really good. I don't feel it justifies the local music store's price of anywhere from $15 to $18. Amazon's price is tempting though, but I still don't feel motivated to buy Mariah's latest album.  <br /> <br />Ratings- scale of 1-10, 1 being worst and 10 being the best.  <br /> <br />1.It's Like That- 10 <br /> <br />2.We Belong Together-10 <br /> <br />Rest of album tracks 3-14 is (ratings hover anywhere from a 5 to a 1) average to bad.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I've read and heard a lot of gripe from \\"devout\\" fans about how Avenged Sevenfold has lightened up, softened up, sold out, and what not.  It's sad how people can be so harsh in their criticisms (these \\"critics\\" obviously being completely musically defunct) towards M. Shadows for taking a MAJOR step up by eliminating the much over-played token screamer role from a modern metal band, and replacing it with beautiful melodies and harmonies, sung with absolute emotion and passion, while at the same time being fresh out of surgery for lacerated vocal chords. It's beyond me. This whole album is a breath of fresh air for those of us waiting for a band to be good in all aspects. With City of Evil, A7X has transcended their \\"Iron Maiden meets punk\\" (isn't that what people said about Metallica back when they released Kill 'em All?) sound, while totally shattering classification as a generic metal core band.  Finally, a band with talented musicians who are leaping out of the overly-serious, atonal metal-core heap and writing complex, hard-hitting, and sometimes trashy heavy metal, the way it should be.  The musicianship is even a step up from Waking the Fallen, with Johnny Christ (Bass) and the Rev (Drums) standing out much more than just a generic rhythm section.  Both members seemed much more focused on this album, and play tightly together.  Kudos to M. Shadows and the gang for releasing a fresh dose of hard rock.
B0000057C5|5.0|The album is excellent, but i would just like to clear up one thing: Du Hast DOES NOT mean you hate!!!! <br />that is a very common misconception <br /> <br />Du hast means you have <br />the song is about marriage vows <br /> <br />You <br />you have * <br />you have me <br />you have asked me <br />you have asked me and I have said nothing <br /> <br />Do you want, until death seperates you, <br />to be faithful to her for all days <br /> <br />No
0393317552|2.0|The dustjacket on Diamond's book included somebody saying this was going to rebut racist arguments.  Since complaining of racist arguments is generally bogus, claiming to rebut them is suspicious. <br /> <br />While the east-west vs. north-south theory is interesting, it doesn't answer much.  Going from Britain east to China brings one into every climate but rainforests.  There is heavy, wet clayey soil in southern England, and better stuff farther north and we get into howling deserts that spawned steppe raiders, and fat loess soils, and praries, and plains.  All of which are little laboratories for technology and agriculture.  So, as it happens, is north-south.  Coastal British Columbia is more inviting than, say, Nebraska, for farming and stockraising.  And what about Australia, large and varied? <br /> <br />Special pleading.  The one that clinched it for me was the excuse for Africans not domesticating the zebra as others have the horse. The zebra, Diamond tells us, shys away from the lariat and thus can't be caught.  This is worth unbundling. <br />First, lariats are generally used FROM horses, and thus presume domestication.  Getting the horses in the first place probably took running them into blind alleys, natural or artificial, or the use of large bolas, or just running them down.  So the lariat issue is bogus from the start. <br />He also implies, but does not state because that would cause a question if anybody thought of it, that wild horses first domesticated did NOT shy from the lariat and were more easily caught.  How does he know?  In addition, not all individuals in a species act the same.  Perhaps all wild horses shied from the lariat--presuming for the moment it was used without being already mounted--except for a few individuals.  Those would be the ones caught.  Of their offspring, the ones who remained in captivity, ancestors of domesticated horses, would be descended from those who didn't think to dodge. <br />We have the thesis, made subtlywithout sufficient assertion as to require actually addressing it, that wild horses who spent millions of years without anything to do with lariats would forget to duck, while zebras, who spent millions of years with nothing to do with lariats, were instinctively wary.  Now, as I say, he doesn't state this, but he quite obviously wants the reader to think it.  This is profoundly dishonest. <br /> <br />Am I misrembering something, or did Pizarro win because the Incas were naifs, not familiar with intrigue and treachery? <br /> <br />There are other cases, but it only takes one or two to discredit the book. <br /> <br />The next question is, what makes the difference?  Culture.  See Thomas Sowell's books on the subject. <br />
1591396190|5.0|<br /> <br />I got to listen to Rene Mauborgne speak about \\"Blue Ocean Strategy.\\"  She was a very entertaining speaker and she made a number of interesting points.  I tracked down the book and read it.  I am glad I did.  This book is the result of years of research into the history of business.  One of the key questions the authors focus on is: \\"What makes a business profitable?\\"  They came to the conclusion that companies which develop new markets can basically print money for the first five to ten years.   <br /> <br />A \\"Blue Ocean\\" represents an uncontested market, a product or service that only one company is selling.  The authors show that historically this has been the most profitable situation to be in, as opposed to a market with lots of competitors, or a \\"Red Ocean.\\"  The authors found that most of the tools for developing strategies in business are focused on \\"Red Oceans.\\"  The authors found that most \\"Red Ocean\\" strategies take the current industry's structural conditions as a given.  A \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" sees market boundaries and industry structures as flexible.  This book was written to help people find new markets, analyze if the new market could be profitable, and then develops strategies for fully exploiting the new market. <br /> <br />One of the key tools for finding new markets is what the authors call a \\"Strategy Canvas.\\"  The idea is to pick a set of key factors that current markets focus on, then on a scale from low to high put a point for where a market is for each factor, and then draw a line for a market.  By looking at where there are no lines you may get some ideas for new markets.   <br /> <br />Once a new market is identified the authors help analyze if there is potential for making money.  They have a set of ideas on how to look beyond the existing demand, more importantly they provide some tools and processes for the analysis just how big a new market might be. <br /> <br />And once the decision is made to move into a new market, the authors have ideas on how to organize the business.  They made the point that there is often a lot of reluctance to make changes and provide some ideas on how to get employees on board. <br /> <br />In many ways developing a new market, or a \\"Blue Ocean,\\" is a lot of work.  And in the past it has been very risky.  By using the ideas from \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" businesses will have a better chance of finding and developing profitable new markets.  It will be interesting to see if there is a new emphasis by businesses to more systematically look for new markets, and where that leads us.   <br /> <br />This is going to be a classic.  It is very readable, and worth rereading.  The key insights and principles in the book are well explained, and supported by lots of examples.  People will be reading it for the next twenty or more years.  If you enjoy books about business, read this book.  If you are looking for ways to expand or develop your business, read this book. <br /> <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|how or better yet why did christian bale feel the need to drop so much weight for this? no matter what the reason, it made an effective statement in this movie. i almost didn't belive he was who he was. there was a scene where he sucked his stomache in and all his ribs shown. i wonder if they used special effects at all or even makeup to add to the effect.<br /><br />ok, now to the story. it was alot like the lost highway from what i can remember about that. this guy hasn't slept for a year and now he is seeing reality totally wrong. that is as far as i am gonna explain. i was interested from beginning to end and if you have an open mind to bizzare movies then you will probably be too.
0689835604|3.0|My daughter has never been interested in this book.  She's 21 months old, and we've had it for over a year, but it never seemed to hold her attention.  Therefore, I can only give it three stars!  She does, however, enjoy the very similar \\"Daddy and Me\\"!  Go figure!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I remember the first time I picked up Toxicity from the store, took it home, and loved it. It was a good album. Not as good as the first, but that is something you have to just accept with a sophomore album. Naturally, when I heard the third was on the way I was already saving money. <br />Mezmerize is the most dissapointing album so far this year, by far. It was supposed to be great, but it really isn't everyone, sorry. Their sound has become cliche, and the tracks on this album are more of a bore then anything else. And when I say cliche, I mean it is the same old SOAD. No new sounds, except that God awful excuse for singing coming from guitarist Daron Malakian. <br />This album is also incredibly uninspired. The lyrical limits of this CD only extend to three subjects - bashing Bush, bashing the government, and bashing Hollywood. This is what has really killed this album. Though SOAD's music has never been original, and they have always stolen inspiration from other groups (especially on Toxicity - Bounce and Chop Suey specifically). This however, looks like an attempt by SOAD to actually be original. But, what do you know? They suck at it. <br />This album is a stinker because the band has no creative spark, and its the same old same old stuff in terms of intsrumentals. The schizophrenia they pride themselves on is just plain annoying now. Too many people are being spoonfed by MTV now to even think that these people are corporate sell-outs. <br />The group tried to do something original with this album, but instead they sound like a very untalented, nu-metalish, trashy version of Green Day's American Idiot. <br />One out of five.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I LOVE this movie. I saw it a dozen times before I cracked and purchased it.  Any fans of James Spader will enjoy \\"the Secretary\\".  It's a great story about dominance and submission, done it the most classy way. Maggie Gyllenhaal is amazing as Lee Holloway.  \\"The Secretary\\" is a story about two people who find love and are able to share something most people would see as distrubing or \\"wrong\\".  Steven Shainberg and Erin Cressida Wilson did an amazing job bringing this short story to the big screen.  The movie makes you realize that not everyone has the same idea of what love is, yet, it's all the same.  I don't know, just buy it.  It's good.<br /><br /> Oh, if you're looking for a movie with a lot of sex scenes and nudity, this isn't for you.  (Buy \\"Crash\\" with James Spader) It's a classic love story with an edge.
0441009425|4.0|I have been quite disappointed by the mediocre contemporary science fiction I've been reading for the past few years.  It has seemed as if one or two good ideas for the background always substituted for an engaging story.  Here, however, the story was quite complicated--and the background was more interesting and believable than that in other contemporary science fiction. <br /> <br />The story takes place about 500 years in the future on the edge of inhabited space.  There are three plot lines that intersect about half-way through the novel.  Plot line one concerns the archaeologist Sylveste Calvin, who is obsessed with the remains of a dead intelligent species on the planet Resurgam.  Plot line two concerns the assassin Khouri who has been sent to kill him by a mysterious entity that gave her an offer she couldn't refuse.  Plot line three concerns weirdo Russians in a half-derelict spaceship that are trying to track down Sylveste so that he can heal their captain, who is barely hanging on against a nanoplague that has taken over his cyborg body parts. <br /> <br />The driving force behind all of this is why the alien species was destroyed in a cataclysm.  The answer is that they showed too much intelligence and were annihilated by the Inhibitors, another alien species that was much older.  The Inhibitors, after a disastrous galaxy-wide war a billion years ago, decided to repress all intelligent life in the universe for the sake of galactic peace.  But matters are not so simple as this: the mysterious employer of the assassin wants to stop Sylveste's investigation because she's afraid it may alert the Inhibitors, but a strange software entity that has invaded the Russian spaceship seems to want the opposite.  But why would one want to alert the Inhibitors to humanity's intelligence?  The characters of the novel are actually just pawns of this struggle. <br /> <br />So the story is as complicated as any Tom Clancy novel.  As in Clancy's novels, there is a lot of detail and verisimilitude.  Because Reynolds is a trained astrophysicist who works for the European Space Agency, he is in a better position to write science fiction than your average English major.  His grasp of relativity, neutron stars, etc. is convincing.  His speculations about future technology are quite interesting, though too many to detail here. <br /> <br />Of course, with any science fiction, the complaint will be that the characters are not sufficiently compelling, and that descriptions and dialogues are truncated or trite.  It is simply a sad fact that an astrophysicist will not write like a man of letters, and that a man of letters will not write like an astrophysicist.  But we all know what we're getting into when we read science fiction, right?  The fact remains that this is the best science fiction I've read in years.  The plot lags at times and the dialogue is frequently inane, but the freshness of the ideas still makes the read worthwhile.
6305079811|3.0|YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! this was a fun flick, but damn. you're outta yer friggin mind.
B00006LLNU|5.0|really wanted to write a review of this album right after I heard it for the first time, but for once, I actually showed restraint. I decided to listen to it over and over -- to immerse myself in it (for that is truly the only way to describe what happens to a listener who is in the grips of Sigur Ros) -- before setting pen to paper, so to speak. <br /> <br />The first time I listened to ( ), I would have rated it five stars and shouted out its gorgeous wunderability to any and all who would listen to me. And after listening to it for a couple of days, I like it even more. Ten times more. But perhaps I am building it up just a bit. <br /> <br />This is not, and will not be, everyone's cup of tea. That's why there are different flavors. <br /> <br />Believe me, if you buy this CD based on my gushing review, you can't be mad and say I didn't warn you. This is music of a kind you probably haven't heard much of before. It floats around you, fills in spaces that most music can't touch, and transports you to a different place in time, a time all at once beautiful, aching, emotional, and nostalgic. And all of this without the aid of words. For you see, the lead singer for Sigur Ros sings entirely in \\"Hopelandish,\\" a self-invented language that mixes pure Icelandic with several other languages (including some English even). This band is beyond pretentious and still I don't hate them. <br /> <br />In fact, the impossibility of \\"understanding\\" the lyrics on ( ) in a conventional manner of thought is, in one sense, what elevates Sigur Ros above so many other artists sculpting the same kind of music. Since nothing is understood, it's up to you to decide what is being said or not said, or, if all else fails, to just give yourself completely up to the sheer emotion of the singer's high, pure voice. Vocals here are used as an instrument, like any other in the band, and together the combination is sheer aural pleasure. <br /> <br />But of course, there are people who will absolutely hate this album. There is a distinctively love/hate relationship built into the fibre of the music itself, because there is no way you could \\"kind of\\" like or \\"sort of\\" not like Sigur Ros, especially with ( ). All eight of the songs are untitled, and flow together into a wonderfully cohesive whole -- and you're either completely with it or completely not. Pick a side. Please try and pick the right one though. <br /> <br />And now is the point where I wonder how I can possibly review a CD that has no real title and no song titles. It could get quite old quite fast for me to start comparing \\"Untitled #1\\" with \\"Untitled #6,\\" even I would start to get confused at some point. But in a sense, that's the precise reason why the album works so well, without the distraction of song titles or \\"real\\" lyrics, the album is almost like eight different parts of a single (and very modern, experimental) symphony. This is an album that all but demands you listen to all in one sitting. There are no singles here. The songs are not randomly placed on the disc. They are meant to be heard in sequence, to experience the rolling waves of their progression to a loud and powerful conclusion. <br /> <br />Very few bands can actually change the way you look at music and the way it can affect you emotionally. Sigur Ros is one of those bands. Unfortunately, they proclaim themselves to be one of those bands, have in fact declared that they will (or at least aspire to) change the face of music forever. Which, they probably won't, not in this lifetime anyway -- if for nothing else than the old maxim that states true genius is always years ahead of the crowd. And this, you see, might well be true genius <br />
0060930349|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, in that its not the usual wine and roses type text. He shows America warts and all and I found it most refreshing. Well done!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is such an amazing show.  It is so easy to get lost in the characters - they are such an interesting and complex bunch.  I would recommend this DVD set to just about anyone looking to be entertained.  There is so much warmth and humour in the stories.  After about 4 episodes, you will become hooked - I am positive. <br /> <br />My favourite character is most surely Dr. Abbott.  What a hoot!!! <br /> <br />I wait with bated breath for season 2 ... please come soon!!!!!
0783240236|4.0|I honestly do I dont know why but my mother always says its because of this movie I saw it when i was like 5 or 6. this a classic by Hitchcock, not better than Psycho but just as good a diffeerent type of horror and very good at that. he keeps a good pace throught the movie, a must have for any fan of horror. Its not a new movie for those who dont know its from the 50's or 60's I would have to look on the back of the cover. So for you new fans who want to check it out  have an idea of what you are getting rent first so you know, and like i say if you know your horror you will definitly enjoy this master piece along with the movie PSYCHO just great  classics.
068817776X|5.0|Edith was very brave and strong for the risks she took.  During this book I would have to take a moment to calm myself down.  The book is written in such a way that you get nervous for her and terrifed to turn the next page.  Edith showed me what bravery is all about.  She took a true risk telling her boyfriend who she actually was but smart because he loved her.  He took advantage of her situation but it was a day to day fear that she would be found out about.
0783225849|4.0|... that will never get old. This movie is actually not about a serial; killer  but a lady who is on the run with sopme money she stole and winds up at the Bates motel. A very creepy atmosphere and great role by Perkins. This movie is creepy good classic horror a definite must if you are a fan of haorror and you know what realk good horror is ( e.g The original 1972 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead 1978, Maniac 1980, American WereWolf in London 1980's ) I could go on and on but if you like movies like ( e.g Scream, i know what you did last summer, Jeepers Creepers etc ) then you most likely wont have this movie cause you really dont know what horror is. <br /> <br />So for any true horror fans out there , you know who you are get this flick its a must for the serious fan of horrors.
B0007P3582|1.0|This album is so God awful, it makes me scared for what our future leaders are going to be. Reality TV watching, 50 Cent listening, manner lacking, disrespecting, MTV believing, bling blinging, thug slinging, trash talking, garbage wearing people. Yikes. I'd rather have the bubble gum music phase that passed instead of this mainstream rap crap phase that has been going on long enough. Hit music radio is NOT good. It sucks! The same five songs over and over again, and none of them are good. Then DJ's that think they are cool because they are on top of the latest trends in \\"lingo\\". \\"Yeah dawg, that's dope foo, we got a bitchin' cut here we are about to drop like a bomb on Sadaam\\" Gag me with a knife, but stab me with it first! This is what todays youth like??? I feel dumber after listening to it. Then hit radio has so many freakin' commercials because of the lack of music that they have available, and then what's next? MTVized shout outs by teenage girls to each other like they are super cool, and girls talking to DJ's about relationship crisis. \\"Yeah, I'd like to give a shout out to my girl Missy in the 214 and my chica Lindsey in... well, the 214 also.\\" \\"My boyfriend is such a prick, he won't split his hostess cupcake with me! What does that mean, does that mean he thinks I'm fat or that he is selfish?\\" GAG ME! Thank God for two new inventions: IPod and JACK/BOB FM. Both play great music, have no (or little used) DJs, and fewer commercials. Plus I can hear new music that is good, like Coldplay, The Killers, Howie Day, Outkast, Lifehouse, Dave Matthews Band, along with my favorite cuts from the 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's. Remember that band that was the fab four? The Beatles? Remember when MJ was black and could pack a dance floor? Remember Stevie Wonder, Hootie and Third Eye Blind? Kids need to start listening to that music, because if the great and late Marvin Gaye were to hear the music of today, he definitely would be asking \\"what's going on?\\"  <br /> <br />BTW Marvin Gaye, a great artist from the 60's-70's-early 80's that people should listen to as well.
B00003CX96|5.0|A reviewer noted earlier that Breaking Away is a very American film, and was not sure how much of it would hit home with foreign viewers. Here's my opinion. While this is obviously a tale of small town America, I think it has a universal appeal. I watched it for the first time with a bunch of friends when I was an 8th grader in Puerto Rico, before I ever visited the United States. I had never heard of Bloomington, Indiana, or Indiana University, or the Little 500. I didn't even understand the language very well back then, so I was reading the Spanish subtitles. But this story is a crowd pleaser that anyone can understand. The universal themes of finding who you are, embracing your roots and succeeding against the odds are there. The characters are likable, regular people that anyone anywhere will find familiar. But most important, this film is simply wonderfully made. I still remember the loud cheers at the movie theater at the end of the race. I never forgot that movie. <br /> <br />Little did I know back then that many years latter I would attend Indiana University. I watched it again in Bloomington. Suddenly this movie felt like home.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|To the person who stated \\"This movie is by far the most hilarious movie ever made,\\" I say: see Charlie Chaplin; see Woody Allen; see The Marx Brothers. This is not \\"by far the most hilarious movie ever made.\\" The great Buster Keaton broke about every bone in his body to do breathtaking stunts in his movies, and you laugh at this movie. What you should have said is \\"In my opinion, this movie is by far the most hilarious movie I have ever seen.\\" <br />To the person saying \\"ignore Ebert,\\" Ebert is a great film critic. What you should have said is \\"I don't agree with what Ebert said about this movie.\\" <br />To the person saying \\"MTV ARE CHEATING BA*****S\\" and \\"TEAM AMERICA SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOVIE OF THE YEAR,\\" I say: no they are not cheating, and purchase a dictionary. They don't cost much. 1. Team America: World Police was not one of the nominees for best picture. What you should have said was: \\"I think Team America: World Police should have been a nominee.\\" 2. Why is it cheating when a majority of the public thinks a movie is the best movie of the year and it wins? What you should have said is: \\"I don't think Napoleon Dynamite should have won best picture.\\" 3. Sense is not spelled \\"Sence.\\" <br />Finally, I say: in my opinion, Napoleon Dynamite is not the great movie some people say it is. It's just not right when a movie about a tall, orange haired nerd filmed during his normal life is given a best movie award over a powerful drama about a blind singer, Ray. This is not a classic comedy. Here is a list of classic comedies: <br />City Lights <br />Duck Soup <br />The General <br />Love and Death <br />Sleeper <br />Sons of the Desert <br />Way out West <br />See these movies and say Napoleon Dynamite is a great comedy. <br />Jonathan H.

B0006B2A2E|5.0|I first saw this movie about a year ago and instantly loved it. <br /> <br />I'm not keen on Jim Carrey, but this time, he hit the nail, and delivers an amazing character: Joel Barish <br />I liked Kate Winslet on some movies, but I fell in love with her on this. <br />This movie shows us an introspective voyage in a relationship, most people will identify with either Joel, Clementine, Mary, or Patrick. It shows us the up's and down's through a timeline of Joel  and Clementine's relationship. It's truly an emotional rollercoaster, so, if you like full comedies, you'll probably hate this movie. It -IS- a happy movie though, it has some comedic things, but most the story involves sad moments.  <br /> <br />Other than \\"the\\" process, this movie could be completely non-fiction.  <br /> <br />The music in the movie (by Jon Brion) is a trip after watching the movie (I own the soundtrack). GET THE SOUNDTRACK!(Mostly score music) <br /> <br />The extras on the \\"Collectors Edition\\" are kind of mediocre, but it will satisfy the EXTREME fan (I am). Apart from the extras on the regular edition, there is a talk with Kate Winslet and director Michel Gondry, and a look inside Eternal Sunshine... some effects interviews and something like that.  <br /> <br />The package is BEAUTIFUL.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is probably the best football movie I've ever seen. Based on the nonfiction book, the story follows a Texas High School through their 1988 season as they try to win a state championship. The pressure put on the players by the entire town is unreal. They can't go anywhere without someone asking them if they're going all the way or  someone showing them their ring from when they won state. The night they lose their first game, the coaches yard is littered with 'For Sale' signs. The town is anything but subtle.<br /><br />The movie is well written and acted showing each of the players as a real person and you experience all the pressure their under. Tim McGraw does an excelent job as an overly critical father of a son who can't stop fumbling the ball. The final game has some of the best  football scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I never read the book so I didn't know the outcome of the game and found myself on the edge of my seat rooting for them to pull it out.
B00005JMUA|3.0|I really liked Kill Bill Volume 1.  I didn't like Volume 2 as much and I couldn't figure out why - it took a few viewings of the film and the cause is... <br /> <br />Uma Thurman.  She's supposed to be a cold-blooded Kung Fu assassin, but she just doesn't pull off the fight scenes very well.  On several occasions in both films, she seems weak, gangly and uncoordinated.  I wish he'd chosen another person for the lead role, but Tarantino considers her \\"his\\" actress, so there you are.  <br /> <br />Kill Bill is sort of like Fight Club in that you either get it or you don't.  I get it, but I also see the flaws.  All in all, worth watching for Tarantino fans, but for others, no big deal if you give it a miss.

B00005JNTX|5.0|The concept for this film started in the Comics revolution of the late 60's with incredible artists like Frank Frazetta, Jim Steranko, Neal Adams, and Barry Smith. They knew anatomy, and they used photographs to compose their backgrounds. Pre-Anime, the characters began to \\"almost\\" move off the pages. Frank Miller came along in 1978. He helped to inaugurate the adult graphics novels-larger formats, better paper, brighter inks-coupled to nudity and R-rated dialogue. Some of this has been around since the late 50's, but the new format was gathering speed and Miller was in the vanguard.<br /><br />Miller's graphic novel's about SIN CITY contained art in panels that broke down like very detailed storyboards. When Robert Rodriguez decided to court Miller and sell him on the idea of converting the graphics to digital video-Miller loved it. Their partnership went so far as to have Rodriguez dropping out of the Director's Guild so that he might be permitted to put Frank Miller in the credits as co-director. Rodriguez created a B&W world where color was used sparingly-and for great effect. Blood was white-or bright red. Some eyes were blue. Some hair was blond. Pale green and pale blue showed up on classic cars.<br /><br />Rodriguez assembled a powerhouse cast. Bruce Willis was first up, to boost the sales of the production and the star power. He was excellent in the film-beginning to appear very Noir-very Chandler and Hammett-a modern Bogart. Using CGI and live actors, Rodriguez was able to do most of the work in his homegrown studio in Texas. Miller created a world part pulp-novel, classic cars-and part hyper-violent martial arts and splatter film. Everybody smoked, many of them drove a ragtop-they could shoot guns with both hands simultaneously-and women, regardless of how far they had fallen-were still treated with respect. More than an adaptation of Millers comic book art-it is literally his artwork brought starkly to life. The effect is original, violent, sexy, existential-and very effective.<br /><br />The film worked off three Miller \\"stories\\"-and the best of the three-THE BIG FAT KILL-starred Mickey Rourke. He can think of this film as his return to the big time. He is brilliant. His character, Marv, is perfectly fitted for this new genre-and his acting, and the action he precipitates-blows all the others in the film out of the water. This may be Rourke's finest performance. He has been a pro boxer, as well as actor-and he needed that physical prowess for this role.<br /><br />Everyone in the film was impressive-with the likes of Clive Owen, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Harnett, and Michael Clarke Duncan all making love, murdering, or slapping around women like Jessica Albo, Jamie King, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, and Brittany Murphy. One critic wrote,\\" This is a Mickey Spillane fever dream!\\"<br /><br />There is a rumor that in the director's cut RR will include some deleted scenes that he shot to flush out all three of the Miller stories. It appears that a sequel is imminent-absolutely necessary. Most of us can't wait for the next installment-to cruise Old Town, prowl the Roark farm, beware of the warrior hookers, love the hot babes, dodge the bullets and swords and knives, and stare at those great cars.xistential-and very effective.  <br /> <br />The film worked off three Miller \\"stories\\"-and the best of the three-THE BIG FAT KILL-starred Mickey Rourke.

B000A5TJA2|1.0|This isn't the original Help! movie, it's a cheap imitation, don't waste your time or money.
B0002SROT0|4.0|yeah--you can tell i have really tried to give Smith a chance.  i've just got really put off by the whispery-quadruple-plus-tracked vocals and the deification of a guy who, sure enough, liked the beatles but who only vaguely approximated what they did.  \\"fond farewell,\\" \\"king's crossing,\\" \\"coast to coast\\"--these, and others, are great tracks.  there's a queasiness to the guitars (tons of vibrato) that may get you (don't listen while drinking!) spinning in a bad way.  the band are confident, and the writing is, unlike so much alt rock these days (with the exception of the very exceptional THE BLACK WATCH or IVY), quite melodic.  i think it's sentimentality that fuels Smith worship--the little lost lamb that everyone wanted to take care of.  he's not the great artist that everyone WANTS him to be/WISHES he were--but, in this last disc, he very much achieved something stellar.  \\"shooting star\\" indeed--and now gone from the night sky.  i used to see him around both NY and LA, writing on cocktail napkins.  you can't say he wasn't a dedicated artist.  i would recommend \\"from a basement\\"--but ignore the rest of his sad canon.
B000000WHC|5.0|This is the best album Gary Moore has ever made, period! Actually, blues purists will be somewhat negative about it! However, he has taken the blues to a more exciting level. The song \\"Still got the blues\\" is simply a beautiful slow number with some awesome guitar work that would make many guitarists feel like beginners! There are some blues rockers such as \\"Movin On\\" with great slide guitar. \\"Pretty Woman\\" gets your adrenalin flowing and has a great solo you won't forget! If you're looking for some blues with spark, then look no further this cd is it! Gary Moore's singing and guitar work on this album is his best!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Others have given the synopsis of the show and the characters.  Nothing you read will make you love this show as much as just watching a couple of episodes.  It is not a teen show - it has a level of appeal for all ages.
0780626494|5.0|It was a great movie and the quality was excellent.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|There has never been a rock band like The Who. I was fortunate to see them many times before the tragic and early death of Keith Moon when the band was at its zenith performing the classic 'Tommy'. This wonderful DVD shows the band at its peak performing both on and off stage. Great moments are captured such as 'Undertones' from Tommy depicting Townsend and Moon (especially) at their best. We are also treated to the band overshadowing the Stones at their Rock & Roll Circus prompting Mick Jagger to delay the release of the event by a decade. This is also an entertaining DVD as we catch the band's off stage interaction and antics. It is not just a DVD for just Who fans but anyone who wants to appreciate the art of performing live, by the best live band there ever was.
B00003CWL6|2.0|Beauty\\" begins with Lester Burnham (Spacey), so beaten down by lifeless routine, that he has lost even the ability to feel pain or anything.  Lester's harpy of a wife Carolyn (Benning), a status-hungry real-estate velociraptor is only capable of dishing out bile.  Between the two suffers Jane, their self-loathing daughter (Thora Birch from \\"Ghost World).  We also meet those who surround them, a gay couple; a retired homophobic marine; his catatonic wife, their seemingly psychotic, voyeuristic and pot-selling son Ricky, and Jane's obviously psychotically vain friend Angela.  <br /> <br />Life though beautiful obviously isn't as nice as it looks.  Lester's cozy suburban home encloses his frigid wife and remote daughter, and for him it's a loveless shelter when he's not at work in his dead-end job.  Then something happens: On the verge of losing his job, Lester quits and blackmails his boss for a generous severance package. Now free, after a fashion, he entertains lustful thoughts of Angela while buying weed from Ricky, who unbeknownst to Lester, has become Jane's lover.  Freed from the daily grind, and with Ricky and Angela seeming to urge him on, Lester recreates himself as a teenager, directionless and determined at the same time. His approach to life disdains the carpediem that typified Hollywood \\"Dead Poets\\" rip-offs of the early 1990's for something more along \\"let the day pass you by.\\" His wife, determined to succeed in real estate, is revealed not just amoral, but stunningly shallow - a walking manifestation of sheer materialism and ostentation. All who populate \\"Beauty\\" live in some illusion - Lester with his renewed youth, Carolyn and her dreams of success, Ricky and Sarah and their fantasies of a future together, Angela's fantasy of herself on the cover of \\"Elle\\", Ricky's father's mirage of the all-American family..etc. After meandering, the script decides that somebody will have to wake up and take reality on the chin for everybody else - and the script settles on Jane and Ricky.  Bad move: Jane and Ricky prove so mature in their love for each other, that they prove better able to wake up and smell the coffee than the rest of the cast.  Instead of a searing portrait of the disintegration of family life, Ricky and Jane prove that love and the family is alive and well.  The closer they get, the more we realize that Jane won't be destroyed by her self-loathing, and that Ricky's not really a psycho at all.  (If children are our future, then we could do far worse than Ricky and Jane.)  As Ricky and Jane straighten themselves out. The rest of the flick seems out of whack - as if the script suddenly became terrified of its capacity for mass destruction and wanted to turn into a sunny parody of its earlier self.  Jane contemplates life without bust enlargement; Carolyn's crass materialism, never disavowed, is mollified by her affair and possible love for her competitor in the real estate market (surprisingly refreshing Peter Gallagher); and Lester's attraction for Jane's friend is more mutual than irony should allow.  The only constant in this perfect storm is Ricky's father, a die-hard Marine whose only apparent role is to set the story firmly in America (apparently the only Western nation that British-born director Sam Mendes can conceive of teeming with right-wing, jingoistic, homophobic, militaristic robots). <br />The script's sudden risk-shyness infects the characters so, that by the end of the film, all they can do is feel satisfied with each other. Even Lester, the most beaten down of them all, feels fine.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the leads of this flick enough to overlook how otherwise overrated it really is. \\"American Beauty\\" never exploits its fictional setting to achieve any sharper edge on a now well-worn theme of the darkness underlying American family life. Surprisingly, it never explains the film's core plot point: Burnham's dramatic character shift (occurring in the film, but apparently late in life).  We getthe idea that people have treated him like dirt for ages, yet in the first shot, he's already equipped to turn the tables on his boss and his wife, and attract Angela as well. <br /> <br />What undermines the film the most is the persistent hint that those on the other side of the camera may be in thrall to the greatest illusion of all - that this really is a deep look at the shattered psyche of the American family that hasn't been done to death decades ago.
B00009V7T2|4.0|This album is one of the newest and best things I have heard in a while. From beginning to end it is all original and unlike anythign I have ever heard before. I recommend it to anyone out there who likes good rock music, you will not be disappointed.<BR>Trucks, ptruckle@hotmail.com
B0000A02TZ|2.0|Yup, I said it. Oh, want me to rub it in? VAN WILDER WAS A LOT BETTER! <br /> <br />Ha, got your attention now, don't I? Well, that's just how I feel. I have heard all this stuff about how this is the grandfather of college comedies (which it just might be), but to me, after having watched a lot of other college and high school comedies, it just seems tame. The movie doesn't seem to really have a plot, but just consists of small skits clashed together, which just doesn't flow right. And come on, that ending? Why the hell isn't someone noticing that guy attaching a hook to one of the cars and the other guy just knocking out the leader of that band?! <br /> <br />One bright spot was John Belushi's performance, but even that one was muddled. Seriously, in the beginning he's this doofus who doesn't really say anything but then, when the sh*t goes down, he's the one who gives this speech which was fairly long, something I wouldn't have guessed he would be capable of. <br /> <br />I guess what I've just written is sacrilege to some, but that is my opinion and I'm sticking with it - for now. I plan to watch it  one more time at some point just to see if it grows on me, but as it is now, it was just a big letdown. I'm sure it was something entirely new when it came out, but it just seems tame to me.
B0007CNXUK|2.0|Entertaining at times but dull in many parts.  Overall, I didn't enjoy this movie.  It was produced well and the acting was good, but the storyline overly glorified Barrie, making him seem like a saint, and it failed to interest me.  It also altered Barrie's life too much for me to appreciate the film.   <br /> <br />In truth Barrie fell in love with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies while her husband Arthur was still alive and practically moved in with the family--one of those types of guests that you can't get rid of. The husband didn't approve of Barrie spending so much time with his wife and children. Can you blame him?  I would look upon someone who had such an interest in my children with suspicion.  In fact, it has often been suggested that Barrie was a pedophile and molested the children though no proof has ever been found to support that suspicion. Some claim he was asexual. <br /> <br />At any rate Mr. Davies unsuccessfully kept Barrie away from his family even after he'd moved his family many miles away to put some distance between them and the writer. Arthur soon died and then Sylvia, and Barrie did in fact get custody of the children. <br /> <br />I believe that the true events of Barrie's life are far more interesting than what was revealed in this film. Had his life been accurately portrayed, including the dirt, this would have been a much better film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|4.0|\\"Sin City\\" is a comic book on a big screen.  Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.<br /><br />A synopsis of \\"Sin City\\" would probably be that all the violence, the plots and the characters cannot be believed at the end of the day.  Rather, the viewer is dwelling in the world of comics where heroes can take a terrible beating but still return for more and the characters are nastier, meaner and more unrelenting than could ever be the case in real life.<br /><br />I saw this film with my 18 year old son who believed it to be the most violent movie he had ever seen.  To an extent he was right although this ignores the fact that the characters were part of a modern world comic strip.  Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.  Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.  It may be a woman's eyes, it may be her dress or it may be the skin colour of a baddie.  On this scale, \\"Sin City\\" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer.  There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time.
B0007OCG56|3.0|<br />This film was better than I thought it would be.  I enjoyed it, but it was long and could have been trimmed down. As usual, Adam Sandler's acting left much to be desired, and as usual, he mumbled a bit in at least one of the scenes.  The maid, Flor Moreno, turned out to be the most memorable character, which was this movie's only saving grace.  The end left much to be desired. My suggestion: rent it before you buy it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence came as a breath of fresh of air to the music industry when rock was failing and hip-hop was eclipsing records everywhere, however these rockers: (sometimes referred to as goths) Ben Moody, Amy Lee, David Hodges, Francesco DiCosmo & Josh Freese instantly shook the world with their weird style and catchy songs.<br /><br />\\"Fallen\\" instantly catches you with it's strong melodies and lyrics. Lee and Moody may be the most obvious of the group however DiCosmo, Freese & Hodges do deserve some acclaim for the way they play their instrumjents and how much they contribute to the band behind the scenes. One of the reasons this album is so addictive to listen to is because of Amy Lee's voice, immediately catches your ear with it's unrivalled timbre and class. Her voice blends well with the other music in the background. Her voice really is the centrepiece for this album.<br /><br />They create amazing sounscapes with the use of strings that are specially written to harmonise with the guitars. Every track is beautiful and have great lyrics. Obviously not everyone will like this album however listen to it, let it grow on you and you will love it like millions of others. Great.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Now I have to agree with a few people who said this album is more \\"mature\\" and musically better. However, this simply is not what Slipknot is.  Is the album good, yeah it's ok, but I enjoy the first 2 albums better. Why? Well, I listen to Slipknot for the pure chaotic, heavy, crazy, insaneness that they possess. This album simply doesn't have that feeling to it. Actually none of the songs on this album have that feeling to it, even the heaviest ones. They are just not the same.    Secondly, I want to point out that almost all the members of the band are very good, professionally trained musicians.  #1) Corey has a great voice 2) Mick can shred like hell, #3) Jim can shred like hell too 4) Joey is an excellent drummer. 5) Paul, well.. he's a bassist what do you want? :-P Now someone also mentioned how neither one of these guitarists are any \\"Kirk Hammett\\".  Have you ever heard these guitarists play anything besides Slipknot/Stone Sour songs?  I Am willing to bet and I guarantee that either one of them could hold their ground with Hammett.  In Fact, I'm sure either one of them could play anything Hammett has played and can play.  Bottom line is Slipknot and Metallica are totally different in style and in sound, of course.  Nevertheless, I watched some guitar videos featuring Mick and Jim and both of these boys know their scales and understand guitar theory and music theory in depth (More so, Jim Root).  So, even though their full talent is not displayed thru the music that they are recording, these 2 are definitely professional guitarists and I would have to say they are probably almost equal in skill with Hammett (More so, Jim Root).
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica is not only the greatest band ever, the \\"BLACK ALBUM\\" is the greatest cd ever.  Every song on the album is a masterpiece with powerful music and meaningful lyrics.  Song's like \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Sad But True\\" are the total package with shocking effects.  The more meaningful song's like \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" go straight to your head and heart.  Each song is 10/10.  I also recommend every other MetallicA cd, especially ...And Justice for all, Load and ReLoad.  If you don't have this cd I feel sorry for you because for every rock fan this cd is not a must have...it's a better have.
B0006GAI6O|4.0|But before John Clark (Richard Gere) discovers his love for dancing, the statement above is pretty accurate. He is a lawyer that goes through the same routine each day, and is almost in a state of stupor, until one day, riding the train home, he sees a woman at a window looking out with a forlorn expression. After that, he is hooked, and has to go there and start attending dancing lessons to find more about this mysterious femme. Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) is an instructor at the dancing studio, and lives a frustrated life ever since she was dumped by her dancing partner / lover at the summit of her career, when she was about to compete in Blackwood, the most prestigious dancing competition in the world.<br /><br />John is married, and even though the relationship with Paulina starts out as a professional one, there is a sense that he is cheating on Beverly (Susan Sarandon). Therefore, he starts hiding his new activity from his family and only gets to share his secret with Link (Stanley Tucci), a co-worker who leads a double life as serious lawyer during the day and a dance machine at night. With this basic set up, the movie succeeds in entertaining through a combination of elements. First, we have the unanswered question of what is going to happen between John and Paulina. Second, the variety of personalities depicted through the different characters allow for a myriad of interesting and funny dialogues. Third, the well choreographed dances allow us to enjoy the music and the artistry of several of the scenes. Finally, even though I found that Gere, Lopez and Sarandon were proficient in their roles, I have to mention Tucci as the actor that should take most of the credit for my enjoyment of this movie. He is perfect for the role he plays and every time he shows up on the screen you know that you will be laughing out loud soon.<br /><br />I have not watched the original Japanese version of this movie, so I have no basis for a comparison in that regard. But I do know that even though this is not a masterpiece, which by the way I do not think it is intended to be, it does deliver what it promises: an enjoyable couple of hours. When comparing it with other movies within the genre, like \\"Dance with me\\", with Chayanne and Williams, I believe that this one comes clearly on top.hat even though this is not a masterpiece, which by the way I do not think it is intended to be, it does deliver what it promises: an enjoyable couple of hours.

6302878527|5.0|I first saw this film when I was a single 20-something, fell in love with it then, and find some 30 years later, as a married father, it's still one of the best treatments of love and marriage ever filmed. I've not seen anything else that's captured all the joy and anguish, betrayal and reconciliation, idealism and compromise that goes into actually making a marriage work. While the film's fractured time frame can be confusing at first, it brilliantly juxtaposes the highs and lows of the relationship and wonderfully makes the point that love is a difficult, courageous undertaking. And who would have known that \\"Bitch!\\" and \\"Bastard!\\" could be such wonderful terms of endearment.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Besides the fact that this is an outstanding album, everyone who has a DVD player in their stereo setup should definitely buy the Dualdisc version. I have a 6.1 surround setup, and the 5.1 DVD side is just incredible. It turns what is already great music into a listening \\"experience.\\" I tend to have what I call 'CD ADD,' where I buy a CD, listen to it once, then file it into the collection. This disc, however, has stayed on top of my DVD player for days at a time, as I can't stop listening to it. <br />  One note: as was said in another review, I don't recommend this set for CD play. My CD player simply refuses to load the CD side, and even my Sony DVD-CD drive on my computer has trouble with it!
1400076943|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into the story, but once I did I was hooked.  I could babble on and on about the exotic nature of the Nigerian setting, which I did enjoy, but this novel transcends its culture while at the same time honoring it. A story of child and spousal abuse (read the novel for an explanation of my review's title), this is also a tale of a young girl's maturation and self-actualization.  Kambili represents the pull between tradition and modernization, but she also resonates as a survivor and ultimate victor over the traumas of childhood.  This is a very sad novel, but at the same time it is a remarkable tale of the resilience and affirming strength of life itself.
B000002LEU|5.0|Wow, what an album...raw, powerful emotion, quintessential manchester factory records..the BEST album that I own...never fails to get me dancing. This album just does not date..Talent at it's best. Ian Curtis is the Sylvia Plath of alternative music. This album isn't as tedious as some Best Of albums (not manetioning any names...THE VERY BEST OF THE SMITHS part 142...)but tastefully documents the career of the band through their best songs...none of the tracks here fail to impress...Buy it...you know you want to.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Spectacular.  I had never really heard any music by The Mars Volta, but when &quot;The Widow&quot; hit the radios, the song grew on me.  After picking up the album, at first I was wondering &quot;What in the heck did I buy?&quot;  It took a while to acquire the taste, but now I can't say enough for the brilliance of Frances the Mute.  It prompted me to jump all over De-Loused in the Comatorium which is also a great album.  Overall, this CD has DEFINITELY got to be a contender for album of the year.
6304698798|5.0|This DVD features such a great perfomances of Lee Van Cleef, Cint Eastwood and Eli Wallach. I feel proud to own this DVD, because it's a classic and the best western movie ever. In my personal opinion Eli Wallach's performance was just perfect, and I think he knew that maybe he wouldn't do it that way again.<br /><br />So to everyone who gets this DVD will own a jewel of western movies.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I am 21 years old, and I never was interested in plays, operas, musicals, or seeing any movie that was a musical.  I hate Grease and other musicals like that, which I am unable to think of their titles at the moment.  Also, I am a big fan of heavy metal and hard rock music, so opera music and that there of also weren't an interest to me.  As was reading the book not an interest.     But my fiancee wanted to watch it.  She's a huge fan of plays, operas, musicals, and the such.  She saw it and said, \\"I want to watch this one.  I on the other hand wanted to watch National Treasure (another good movie).  I never rent more than one, but wanting to make her happy, I rented it.  We got home and I put it in.  I started by watching the trailer to it on the DVD and was like, \\"Whoa!  This actually looks pretty good.\\"    We watched it and I was totally blown away. The music, to my surprise was hitting decently heavy.    The Phantom was amazing.  He was like...totally, no words can explain.  The voice was very angellic and then does a complete 180 to being really demonic.  And the rest were great too.    Now, I even want to read the book and and see the opera/play.  I even bought the soundtrack.  The score was amazing.  The lyrics will stick in your head and stay there.    STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!!  Christine doesn't end up with Raoul at the end.  That ring was the ring Raoul gave her.  She gave it to the Phantom to show him she's not going to stay with Raoul and that there is hope and good in people.  Also, the Phantom lost the sword fight to show that he is only human and not superhuman.  He hung the one guy because he was always telling those stories about the Phantom and he didn't like that.      (...)  And thank you for listening.  Please enjoy the movie as I did.
1400043662|5.0|Reading, \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" was a mystical experience for me.  I felt like I was dreaming about being in a room with an open window and occasionally an ocean wave splashed water on the concrete floor and the breeze carried the smell of brine up into my nostrils.<br /><br />Did it all make sense? No.  Were there parts of the book that weren't as fully realized as they could be?  Yes.  Was it the most deeply affecting novel I'd ever read? Yes.<br /><br />Haruki Murakami's work is about things and people existing on multiple planes.  In \\"Kafka,\\" Colonial Sanders is a pimp. A son makes love to his fifteen year and fifty year old mother.  A simpleton can talk to cats but can't understand much of what people say.  By accepting these things, I opened myself up to the illogic of my own subconscious and Kaftka became a waking dream where I felt intensely alive and deeply connected to the world.  There has been some critical discussion about how Murakami's technique is based on the Shinto religion.  If that's true, then  Murikami's genius is in making me feel the essence of this religion without my having any understanding of the culture or philosopy from which it sprang.<br /><br />I see \\"Kafka\\" as a portal into a world of a new kind of consciousness.  I see this in universal terms rather than as a merely a creation of Murakami's.  I feel that while Kafka springs from his imagination  it speaks to my creative core, one I share with the rest of humanity.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album is amazing. Usually, the first time you listen to an album, you don't like it too much. But this time, that didn't happen. This album was great right from the beggining! With singles like \\"Rebellion\\" and \\"Neighbourhood #3\\" this album beats many others. <br /> <br />I am a huge U2 fan and I beleive that this band got some of their influence from U2. If you like U2's rock songs in the 80's, this is exactly where the got their influence. On the album \\"The Joshua Tree\\" by U2 there is a song called \\"Exit\\", listen to that song and you'll find that it sounds like \\"Rebellion\\" and they have a comparison. <br /> <br />But enough of that lets get to the songs. The 4 Neighbourhoods are a great introduction to their album especially \\"Tunnels\\" <br />which is my favorite song on the album. It starts off with a light melody, and the tension builds up for the end. I realized this band is from Montreal because of some of their French lyrics used in the mix of these songs. Also, \\"Haiti\\" and \\"In the backseat\\" are great endings. <br /> <br />This band uses alot of instruments and they actually have about 15 members playing in the band. You can also call them rock. This band better get ready for future songs because I have a feeling they will be a huge worldwide band .  <br /> <br />I reccomend this album for any instumental, rock, or even classical fans.
6305327041|5.0|This is by far the freshest piece of film I have seen in some time.  A brief glimps into four rooms of a hotel containing the most unusual characters, hinged together by an equally unusual bellhop.  It is not the fact that the film includes significant stars (this is evident), but that each star and his/her situation (predicament...fait....), however unfathomable, prove perfectly suited to the environment.  I am drawn to each room and the characters within as if I were a fly drawn in by the draft of an open door.  While such characters are outrageously fictional, we also imagine the very real and potentially ecclectic groups of individuals that might be found in any given hotel on any given day. This is a movie that you will either love or hate.  If you are willing to try something thoroughly new and refreshing, definitely give this a try..., or four.
B00005JLRT|2.0|It seems oddly appropriate on the day of James Doohan's passing to say that \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" is a bad movie.  Just awful.  As much as the recently cancelled  \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\", \\"Nemesis\\" is a symbol of just how far this once great franchise has fallen. It also dispels the notion that even numbered Star Trek movies do not stink.     It is obvious that the producers where attempting to make \\"Nemesis\\" the Next Gen's \\"Wrath of Khan\\".  Not only did they  fail miserably but it is almost insulting the extent to which they ripped-off almost every major plot thread from \\"Wrath of Khan\\".      This movie is cold, emotionless and lacks the passion and excitement of \\"Wrath of Khan\\".   Tom Hardy as Shinzon is supposed to be Khan to Picard's Kirk.  However, Hardy is no Ricardo Montalban  and Patrick Stewart, while a better actor than William Shatner, could not summon the requisite emotion to make this movie work.  The rest of the cast is no better.  Clearly tired of playing these roles the cast merely mailed in their performances.     The movies special effects and action sequences are  merely OK but do not come close to clearing the bar set by George Lucas and ILM.  Even if they did they would ultimately fall flat because the rest of the movie is so utterly horrendous.    The movies sole bright spot is the performance of Brent Spiner in a dual role as both Data and his Rainman like \\"brother\\" B4.  Spiner is so talented he simply never disappoints.  As a matter of fact the only scene in \\"Nemesis\\" that conveys any real emotion is Data's Irish wake at the end of the film.    Leave it to a movie this bad to leave an excellent scene on the cutting room floor.  One of the deleted scenes is an alternate ending where we would have been introduced to the Enterprise's new first office Commander Martin Madden, to have been played by first rate character actor Steven Culp (\\"Desperate Housewives\\", \\"JAG\\", \\"The West Wing\\",  \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\").  This light hearted scene which showed Riker leaving the Enterprise for the last time and ended with the Enterprise warping to where \\"No Man has Gone Before\\" was shelved.  In its place the movie ends with the Enterprise in an orbital dry dock undergoing repairs.  An unworthy ending to end what was once a first rate franchise known as Star Trek: The Next Generation.    Star Trek is in desperate need of fresh blood and a new perspective.   Rick Berman has run this franchise into the ground.  He should step aside but sadly I do not see this happening.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves movie that is with out a doubt one of the worse films to come out of a mainstream studio in quite a while. Keanu gives one of the worse performances of his career and the movie itself is not worth its weight in the film it was created in. Rachel Weisz is the only actor in the film who comes out with her dignity intact and that's because she does give an amazing performance that is way too mature and good for this film. She could have been a lead in a much better movie with her character other than to hold Keanu's hand and to make sure he does not forget his lines, that's how great her performance is here. Unfortunately while she is compelling in her role, the movie just does not hold your attention and you will end up feeling sorry for her for being stuck in this bad movie. <br /> <br />The one star is for Rachel Weisz's effort in respecting herself as an actor and her effort to give the audience more than the bad movie that is presented to them. The rest of the film does not warrant your attention or your time. <br />
B00094OB1Q|5.0|I had better \\"declare an interest,\\" because a previously published and enthusiastic review of this recording, in its original LP version, written by me (using the pseudonym \\"Roland Graeme\\") is quoted on the back of the CD's box and on a sticker affixed to its front.  If this superb 1969 recording was previously reissued on CD, I missed it.  Here it is, as a budget-priced two-CD set, and it's even better than I had remembered it!  The only real complaint is the absence of a libretto (the enclosed leaflet does contain a running plot summary, matched to the CD tracks). <br /> <br />Despite the recording's age, the sound is startlingly good, with the solo voices placed rather forward, and stereo carefully used to clarify many musical details.  Karl Bohm's conducting favors fast tempos and generates a driving intensity.  He includes the Leonora Overture Number 3, inserted between the end of the Act 2 Prison Scene and the opera's final scene:  the overture is on a separate CD track, so the listener can skip it at will; but the performance is a thrilling one, that fully justifies the interpolation.  The Dresden orchestra plays the score as well as any other ensemble has on records.  The usual abridgement of the spoken dialogue is included, and the dialogue is done by the singers, not by a separate cast of actors. <br /> <br />There is a strong cast.  Unless one's standards are superhuman, it would be difficult to find fault with the work of Edith Mathis (Marzelline), Franz Crass (Rocco), or Marti Talvela (Don Fernando).  (Mathis, surely one of the most under-rated sopranos of her generation, is especially good.)  Theo Adam makes an incisive Pizarro.  I know that some people find James King (Florestan) rather stiff in manner, and also find the actual timbre of Peter Schreier (Jacquino) dry and uningratiating; both tenors, however, are in peak form here. <br /> <br />When this recording was made, Gwyneth Jones had burst upon the international opera scene as a major star, tackling many of the big dramatic soprano roles, and her performance of Leonora shows why.  The voice is powerful, agile, and, at its best, warm and womanly in quality.  Jones was an intense performer with a highly personal manner--she pours it on unstintingly here.  Hindsight, of course, is always 20/20, and in retrospect one can hear signs of the incipient vocal problems that nearly brought the soprano's career to a halt only a couple of years after this recording was made.  (Jones had the last laugh, in a sense, because she recovered and continued to sing some of the most demanding roles in the soprano repertory for another three decades; the recording companies, however, seem to have decided that her sound was \\"unphonogenic,\\" and as result her studio recordings during those years were few and far between.)  Even on this 1969 recording, Jones displays isolated moments of strain and imperfect intonation.  Her voice, basically plush and sumptuous in quality, has a tendency to turn hooty or curdled in sound at odd moments, which definitely does not appeal to all tastes:  an otherwise magnificent phrase can contain one or two bad notes.  Still, this is a memento of an important artist, caught before her singing became controversial.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a budget-priced version of this opera, and you already know that you like (or can tolerate) Gwyneth Jones' singing, then this set is a strong contender.      <br /> <br />
B00003CWL6|2.0|Besides the funny moments in this film, there is nothing good about it. Kevin Spacey delivers some very funny moments and the music in the movie is good but the movie itself isn't good at all. First of all, it's nothing about beauty. So don't expect this movie to be beautiful. It's disturbing and grotesque. I'm sure that everyone probably agrees with me that there is normally a protagonist in movies. Well, not here. There are no heroes but only perverted and strange people.  <br />There's the frustrated dad who doesn't get any sex from his wife and whose daughter hates him. He only is freed from his problems with his family when he falls in love with his daughter's best friend. I know, that's disgusting. So now, he's working out, blackmails his boss, smokes pot and does whatever he wants. No hero there.  <br />The girl that he falls in love with is obssessed with sex and finds herself to be \\"not oridinary\\" and beautiful. She's very dirty and isn't a hero.  <br />Then, there's his wife, the realtor who likes material possessions and cheats on him and doesn't seem to care. She calls herself a victim, and may I ask: \\"of what?\\" You're rich, you have a family, how the hell are you victim? And then she even considers killing her husband because she's a victim. And she doesn't even know that he is fantasizing about someone. Wow. No hero there. <br />Then there's their daughter who hates both of them, especially her dad. For what reason? I don't know! She even jokes about wanting to kill him. That's not a very pleasant joke! She wants breast implants even though she has large enough ones. (She flashes her boyfriend). No hero there.  <br />Then, there's the daughter's boyfriend. He's a psycho who films everything and sells pot secretely. When you're supposed to like him, it's hard to.  <br />Then there's the boyfriend's dad who is a veteran army lieutenant. He's abusive and very violent and mean. And he has some skeletons in his closet. No hero there either. <br />See, the movie was hard to watch because you don't like any of the characters in the movie. It was depressing to see our society shown as it is and without any character that you like, well... <br />The movie had too many sex references and also had lots of uneccessary and weird stuff. Like when Kevin Spacey's character fantacizes, WEIRD! <br />The worse for me though is that I had lots of high expectations for this movie and it ended out being nothing spectacular, just a mediocre and not memorable movie. The acting is good as are some jokes, but it really isn't what everyone says it is. It's not original and is very strange. There were also many random scenes in it and well... <br />I don't even recommend it for a rent unless you want to see what the fuss is all about but the academy must have different opinions than me because this movie didn't deserve best picture. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey as usual in a very strong performance but the movie wasn't strong or interesting. It was about a man breaking free thanks to an 18 year old girl that he falls for but unfortunately the movie didn't do what I thought that it would.  <br /> <br />Buddy Kane: \\"Who's the king?\\" <br />Me: \\"Definitely not Sam Mendes!!!!!\\"
B00026W82U|5.0|this is an amazing cd. It gets better everytime I listen to it...
B00005JNSK|5.0|Having never watched the Original Film Version or read the book, I have got to say that this movie blew me away. I generally think most Tim Burton movies are wierd and Johnny Depp is overated as an actor and more wierd than Tim Burton, but I have to say that they both exceeded any expectations that I had. The movie was a visual delight and the songs were wierd and catchy. Depp is as wierd as he always is but so what? He obviously hates the other four kids as anyone would and I enjoyed their deserved fates. For someone with low expectations, I was really entertained by this movie. Go see it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

B00004TX5F|5.0|Once more the life owns by far, much more imagination than we ever know. The reality overpasses the fiction.<br /><br />This is the awful portrait about the last frontier the human being can reach in search of the petulant narcissist; and when this happens, ambition joined to the indolence and triviality can result a dangerous cocktail with unthinkable results for the physique, the emotional wounds and disastrous change in the sexual behavior spouted as the merciless decision of beings that hardly may be classified of humans.<br /><br />This is the story about a talented child owner of a promising voice; to whom simply with the only purpose of keep this vocal coloratura much longer, is castrated. So this criminal fact, masked behind the perpetual search of the preservation of the artistic future will shock your sensibility, and will be motive of your concern through this intense drama.<br /><br />Belgium may be proud of his lavish son.<br /><br />It's useless to affirm we are before the most original and striking film of 1994 and one remarkable movies in the decade.
B000002UJQ|5.0|first of all, i do not consider myself a radiohead fan, i am a lover of their music and i am proud that a bands like radiohead exists and i am glad that others can be in agreement with me without the vicious bickering of who is really a radiohead fan and who just pretends to like them and all of that crap. it's so trivial and unnecessary. with that said, i think this an amazing album with some of the deepest songs i have ever heard. and everything in my day could have been going wrong and i am on the verge of tears and i'm pmsing and everything is just wrong and i'll get into my car and No suprises starts playing and everything is ok, everything is perfect and i feel infinite like nothing can stop me and i feel like i am part of the road and a part of the clouds, b/c that's how this song is supposed to make you feel- like there really is no beginning or end. life is infinite.

B00097A5HW|5.0|I must say I love 10 out of 12 of the songs in this cd. Shakira is back and better than ever. I really don't like her in English..she loses her enchantment..her power.. Shakira's lyrica are felt only if you understand spanish....I thought she had lost it in Laundry Service.songs like .Eyes like yours and Objection were just plain  horrible.... <br /> <br />Now she sounds great...her voice, the music can't wait to see this production live!!!. I recommend \\"La Pared\\" with the \\"coldplay\\" sound....\\"La Tortura\\", and Obtener un Si. <br /> <br />My least favorite songs are : Lo imprencindible and the reggaeton version of La Tortura, what was the point to that??? <br /> <br />Shakira you rule!
B000059ZLH|5.0|This concert of Dream Theater is fantastic.<br /><br />It's right I don't need to tell anything about Dream Theater.

B0009MDPYW|1.0|Unimaginative supernatural horror thriller that rather treat the audience like idiots than to give them a story with any meaning. Keanu Reeves lacks the acting chops to pull off his character's moral dilemma and the screenplay lacks credibility with its juvenile dialog and halfhearted views on the subject that it's trying to cover. It's more and less a big budget version of the television show \\"Angel\\" but with out it's cleaver writing or it's interesting look at the war between Good versus Evil. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks coherency and certain scenes don't jell in terms of narrative. The only actors in the movie who manages to transient the bad script and misdirection of the director is Rachel Weisz (Runaway Jury,The Shape of Things) who does give the movie's only compelling performance and the great Peter Stormare(Cocolat,Fargo) whose five minute cameo as the devil has more meat than the main character himself. Weisz and Stourmare are about the only positive things that come out of this supernatural debacle and if the studio wanted to make good movie, they could have just focus their energies at Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmare and have the movie revolved around their characters instead of the uninspired character of John Constantine and could have made a real and scary supernatural thriller.    Too bad that it's the audience who have a better imagination that the people who made this film.
B000002G7E|5.0|This 2nd Velvet Underground album was their defining moment and one of the most telling, noisy , diverse, masterpieces ever to emerge from the 60's.  The raw, train-like chug and burn of the guitar on \\"White Light/White Heat\\" coupled with the doowop-y back up vocals and honky tonk piano line is one of the most classic moments of rock and roll brilliance. Then comes \\"the Gift\\", with its funked out almost b-movie backing track, this eerie narrative was a first and sounds like nothing else even today. \\"Lady Godiva\\" is classic VU drone pop with some clever vocal musing near the end. \\"Here she comes now\\" is like a VU motown lullaby and washes out the first side of the vinyl. \\"I heard her call my name\\" begins side 2 with a bang & is one of the most urgent, primitive rock songs ever recorded. Finishing the album is the ultimate tribal rock jam \\"Sister Ray\\", one of the most visceral, droning, tranced out rock songs ever. This album will change your life. Essential. Monumental for 1968!
0689504764|5.0|I've just noticed the reviewer who said her autistic son loves GOING ON A BEAR HUNT. <br /> <br />That was our household, too. <br /> <br />We bought the book when it first came out--our son is 18 now--and he adored it. It was the only book we could read to him, and he used to chant the poem along with us when we'd take walks around the neighborhood. <br /> <br />All these years later, GOING ON A BEAR HUNT has a different meaning for me. <br /> <br />It's the refrain. 'We can't go over it, we can't go under it, we'll have to go through it!' <br /> <br />That's autism. You can't go over it & you can't go under it; you have to go through it.  <br /> <br />We did, and we've all come out on the other side in one piece. <br /> <br />I have such happy memories of the book that I'm buying a new copy to keep always.
1400032717|5.0|WOW! This was a very refreshingly different and unique style of writing. You're comfortable in the narrator's head and get a true sense of his autistim. The story and writing style holds you even though it takes you off tract many times. It all makes sense as you move through the clutter of his mind. A very refreshing unique story! <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I am not a huge fan of the \\"zombie\\" genre. I enjoy them but they don't rank as my favorites. \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is the funniest horror movie I have ever seen. The horror is there enough to be a horror film but not so much to overpower the comedy, or vice-versa. Some of the jokes were hard to understand since I'm an American and don't watch much British humor but not enough to take away from this great movie.
B000002UB3|2.0|That being said, this is still better than most other albums. But this is shockingly mediocre, especially from a band who, two years earlier, were writing epics like \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"A Day in the Life.\\" Most songs here feature weak, annoying melodies and drugged-out, throw-away lyrics, and uninspired vocals. Their heart wasn't into this at all, and it shows. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is pleasant, at best, \\"I Want You\\" is inexcusably long, and the medley is excruciating slop. If you can sit through all that though, you will hear two of Harrison's finest compositions. It was those two that earned the album its 2 stars.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mel Gibson's vulgar, gaudy movie depicts just one of the many many thousands of purely imagined god-myths and invented god-in-human-form stories which man is compelled to create and fantasise about. In the movie, `God' Sacrifices Himself to Himself to Save from the Wrath of Himself those Created & Sustained by Himself and who Live & Move & Have their Being Within Himself.     Christ is as real as Apollo. God as real as Zeus. This movie and the reactions to it illustrate that Christ belief is merely a product of primal fetishism and primitive obsession, compulsion and fixation. The `Jesus Christ' fantasy is sustained by its power to satisfy: fetishistic fixation on feelings about suffering; the self-centred child's desire for a parent or brother figure to make altruistic sacrifice; the wish to be rescued; guilt, shame, punishment & persecution incantation-loops; emotive empathising with vulnerability; and the ego's drive for immortality.     Babies become fixated on an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-perfect parent figure. The result might be rigid 'Christ' & `God' fixation in adulthood.    It is coarse and crass thinkers that bought this Jesus drivel wholesale - making a film which compulsively obsesses on the fairy tale's sado-masochistic details (further fantasised into existence by Anne Catherine Emmerich's ludicrously fetishistic book).     Bible-zombies and robots-of-Christianity enslave themselves with thought-loops of Jesus-gibberish such as this movie. They ignore the fact that man has always invented gods and goes on doing so. This man-breathed myth is no different from any other products of the human imagination and compulsions to invent god.     The plot for this movie derives from a book whose cult is based on superstition, appropriated astro-theologies, plundered pagan elements, and heavily plagiarised deity myths (Osiris, Marduk, Jupiter, Mythra, Attis, Prometheus, Baal, Buddha...). This movie tells the spurious tale of `The Christ' who (so the wish-fantasy goes) is the route to eternal life.  However, when we suffer bio-electrical, bio-physical & bio-chemical brain and body death, it is all over for each and all of us - your life-force, and everyone else's, ends, and eternal life is exposed for the futile fantasy that it is.  When all of mankind is dead `God', `The Lord' etc will cease to be, since the collective mind of humankind is the SOLE LOCUS OF EXISTENCE of 'God' and `Jesus Christ'.   [...]
B00000JNJ1|4.0|Jay Gatsby's right, Nick Carraway's wrong -- Rod Stewart may be on about his umpteenth career redirection (and by no means the worst one), Ron Wood may have long since rolled on, and Ronnie Lane may be dead at a sadly early age, but put Good Boys into your CD player and they are all back, carefree, rowdy, scruffy, and loud from more than thirty years ago.  (And, by the way, a whole lot less sloppy than they were often accused of being.  These guys may not have looked serious, but they were.)  Once again they are getting whipped until dawn by Miss Judy; telling a tart to straighten her dress cause the folks have come home early; paying cab fare home and loaning out their best cologne; learning too late from poor old Granddad.  Their Wicked Messenger take on Dylan doesn't hold up so well (especially considering the way Bob keeps reinventing that song just like he does with most of his others) and the last couple of songs here (You Can Make Me Dance and Open to Ideas) sound all Rod and no Faces -- a hint of what was to come.  But for thirteen glorious cuts from Sweet Lady Mary through Ooh La La, it's like seeing the band raucously on stage again and leading their audience on a night of smirking and rocking fun.  Just don't hit yourself with that microphone stand as you twirl it, Rod.
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|These ladies offer a great variety of sounds that are not only pleasant to listen to but to look at as well.  The pairing of beautiful women with shades of classical and electronica makes for an listen of pure joy.  This collection of songs puts me in the mood...
B00004TDTO|5.0|\\"Jaws\\" is simply the best nature-gone-awry horror movie ever made. I read the novel and was marginally stirred by it, but the cinematic adaptation brought the true horror potential of a giant rogue shark home is a primal way that other films have sought to imitate, but could never duplicate.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg was unarguably the genius behind the execution of the film, but everyone from the excellent cast, to the special effects gurus (remember this was done before digital special effects were even dreamed of), to the editors and sound effects people coalesced to produce an amazing film.<br /><br />I am sure that everyone knows that the film is about a giant rogue shark terrorizing a resort community, and the man-versus-beast battle which ensues, but to me the real genius here is in the development of the lead characters into real, believable people thrust together in a very trying situation. I personally believe that Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider are the true stars here. Shaw's \\"USS Indianapolis\\" monologue is one of the most effective in film history (the \\"Making of\\" feature discusses this at length in an interesting segment), and Roy Scheider's \\"bigger boat\\" adlib is possibly the best line in the entire film.<br /><br />There are many extras, including an interesting \\"Making of\\" feature, which is highly recommended viewing, even if you normally don't enjoy such things.<br /><br />Although this film has been repackaged many times (and undoubtedly will be again), to me that doesn't detract from the film itself: buy the cheapest version of \\"Jaws\\" you can find on DVD. Forget the extras if you wish: this is a film worthy of being called a true cinematic legend.
B000002UAR|5.0|This was my very first Beatles album. I bought it last year because of hearing 'Eleanor Rigby' on the radio. I have it never once regretted it, as this is, song-for-song, far better than Sgt. Pepper. John Lennon was creating trippy kaleidoscopes of sound by this point, such as \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" the first use of backward guitars ever, while Paul McCartney tried out various forms of art-pop, such as the lush stringscape of \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\" And Harrison also establishes himself as a songwriter, with the fierce \\"Taxman\\" and Indian-inspired \\"Love You To.\\" The amazement to Revolver, however, isn't all the studio effects that the Beatles came up with. It was that they had managed to cover so much ground on a single album and have it all work together. I cannot suggest this album enough.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I've been a big Foo fan for quite some time, and I don't know if this makes my experience with this record better or worse. For one, if you are expecting a spectacular single such as \\"Everlong\\", \\"One By One\\", \\"Monkey Wrench\\", etc, this is not going to be the album for you. However, if you are looking for a pretty solid [double] album, this might be it.  <br />   Save for a few tracks, most of the songs on both discs are pretty solid and listenable, however there are the few that didn't grab me. <br />   The rock disc is pretty mediocre. There are hints of Foo-genius that have gotten the band where they are today, and remind us of why we listen to these guys, but there are really no major standouts, and the production is almost overdone (a problem that I think has plagued other bands such as The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Everclear, and Audioslave). A big problem is that the guitar work on some songs are just way too loud, and the vocal work is just pathetic with Dave screaming far too much. <br />   The acoustic disc, on the other hand, is quite a gem of its own. The songs are better crafted, and have some of Dave's best lyrical work. His voice on the acoustic side is for sure his best achievement vocally that he's ever done. Standout songs include \\"Still\\", \\"What If I Do\\", \\"Virginia Moon\\", and \\"Friend Of a Friend\\", a song that one can't help but think of Cobain when hearing it (very reminiscent of Nirvana Unplugged). <br />   This double album may not be the most solid Foo effort to date, and the rock disc is very mediocre, but the acoustic side makes up for all its shortcomings, and then some. Dave has really found his niche as a songwriter, and in this 20 track double album, lay one of his best 10 track albums he's done yet.
B0000AMJED|5.0|Crazyness! But still that spyder in real life could not out run those cars and hang with the EVO! Come on, a little fake but nice film , I liked it alot . Not as much as the first but it was nice. Check it out .
0312323859|5.0|This is such a fun book!  I read it only two weeks after I finished Something Borrowed.  I didn't want Something Borrowed to end so imagine how happy I was to see that it continued with Something Blue.  The characters are incredibly real and likeable (even Darcy!).   <br /> <br />I read each of Emily Giffin's books in just over a day.  I was just so engrossed and curious to know what happened next that I couldn't seem to put either of them down easily.  <br /> <br />I just also found out that the author is from a few towns away from where I live so that made me like her even more!! <br /> <br />You'll enjoy reading this book.  Be sure to read her other book, Something Borrowed, too.  I promise you won't be disappointed.

B000000WA4|5.0|In 1995, grunge was beginning to fade. But Billy Corgan and Company were around to give it one more jolt before it died and became the realm of rip-off artists. 'Mellon Collie' was, and still is, one of the most ambitious and indulgent albums in rock history. Lasting over 2 hours, the album goes through rock, pop, folk, metal, prog, New-wave, and neo-classicism, experimenting with everything,and only occasionally falling flat on their face.  For the pop fans, there's the sighing New Wave of \\"1979\\" and the majestic, orchestral \\"Tonight Tonight.\\" For the rock fans, there's the fist pumping anthem \\"Here Is No Why\\" and the blistering \\"XYU.\\" And for those who like sprawling epics, then \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\" and \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" were made for you. 'Mellon Collie' really only falters twice: \\"Where Boys Fear To Tread\\" and \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth.\\" The other 26 songs on here are worth every penny of the double-album price.
B0001CCXY8|1.0|Hey look what I can do! I can belch into a microphone and slap the strings on my guitar and it makes SOUNDS!<br /><br />This sums up Cannibal Corpse and other crappy \\"Satanic\\" gore metal bands who try too hard to be evil. I can't stand dumbs*its like this \\"JesusChrist Died in Vein\\" moron. Oh I get it now. Vein. Vain. It's like they are the same... but they're not! The same. Yeah. This musical ape trashes melodic death metal? I suppose metal bands are required to have no musical ability or talent. If you can play more than two chords and change your timing in mid-tempo, then F*CK YOU buddy! If you want boring mainstream recycled death metal, yeah... listen to some Corpse. If you want metal that is memorable and played by MUSICIANS who are masters of their trades, listen to some Opeth, Dark Tranqillity, older In Flames, At the Gates, etc...  Leave the gore metal to the brainless tone-deaf Satan-wanabees.<br /><br />Oh yeah.. you want evil? Listen to some Acid Bath. These guys will make your skin crawl without even trying. Unlike some other \\"really evil\\" bands.
B00004SZWB|5.0|What an amazing CD this is. Originally released in 1980 and still sounding up to date. Not as great as his 70s masterpieces, but hey, still a fabulous outing, with varying musical influences and outstanding songwriting. The album made it to #3 on the Billboard album charts.<br /><br />The tribute to Bob Marley, `Master blaster (jammin')' is a delightful bouncy Reggae number with great horns and outstanding vocals, which made #5 in the US and the UK top 10.<br /><br />There's the mid tempo, Disco-tinged, synth driven `All I do' featuring backing vocals from Michael Jackson (repaying the favour for Stevie's `I can't help it' from his `Off the wall' album the previous year) and a great sax break.<br /><br />`Rocket love' is a tender atmospheric ballad with great `Do do do...', dramatic strings, and lyrics comparing a woman's love to a ride in a rocket. Classic Stevie!<br /><br />`I aint gonna stand for it' (a UK top 10 and US #11) features backing vocals from the Gap Band (whose vocal styling was clearly inspired by Stevie), and is an upbeat song with faint Country elements in the verses, which connects to the next song, `As if you read my mind' with a great piano bridge. Percussion on this song is outstanding.<br /><br />Other standouts are the tender much covered piano ballad `Lately' (a UK top 10) featuring an achingly passionate delivery from Stevie, and closing track, the sunny, poppy `Happy Birthday' which was a tribute to Martin Luther king Jr, and was a part of the push to get his birthday declared a national holiday, which it eventually was.<br /><br />It was a real hot July....
B000002UVX|4.0|Despite having a few songs jamming well over six minute mark, and with Jimi not even taking lead vocals on two cuts, I STILL rate this as an excellent, must have, Hendrix album.   <br /> <br />What I'd like to do though is emphasise how much I enjoy the playing of Cox and Miles, as they're such a great rhythm section here - those guys are really cooking!   <br /> <br />What's always bugged me though - I've read some quite dismissive reviews of Miles' playing on this record, and it's unjust.  Compared to Mitch Mitchell he just plays clean and funky - he doesn't need to work it like Mitch, because he doesn't have to!  He has a style here of his own and a sense of rhythm few can match! <br /> <br />If you haven't got this record, buy it now!

B000003BD3|4.0|I don't feel the Stones are a consistently good live act, although the set they played here, isn't without merit. I have to give them credit, because Mick Jagger is still today what you see in this film. He's got a few lines on his face, and a few traces of grey in his hair now, but time hasn't been his enemy. Keith Richards, on the other hand, doesn't even look like the same person anymore; that's what hard living will do to you.<br /><br />Their set wasn't bad, though it had that \\"garage band\\" feel to it, but that's always been one of their selling points. \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" \\" Parachute Woman,\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" and the others all sound up to snuff, although some back-up singers would've helped; they had a piano player, and a percussionist, why not back-up singers?<br /><br />Taj Mahal's number was OK, but seemed to be a little lifeless, and Marianne Faithful has been correctly described as \\"lovely,\\" her segment was a good off-set to everything else.<br /><br />The Who's performance was definitely show-stopping, hard to believe Keith Moon and John Entwistle are gone. They were so \\"alive.\\" They were just coming into their own when this event was held.<br /><br />Depending on my mood, often my favorite segment was Jethro Tull's number. Isn't annoying when people call Ian Anderson \\"Jethro Tull?\\" Even though Anderson was the only musician with the band at every phase of its existence, \\"Jethro Tull\\" was, and is, the band's name. Apart from Anderson, none of the musicians here were with Anderson for that long. Drummer Clive Bunker was replaced by Barriemore Barlow, Bassist Glenn Cornik was replaced with Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, John Evan was added on piano, and Martin Barre replaced the man playing slide guitar here, Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi.<br /><br />I thought The Dirty Mac was cool, Mitch Mitchell from the Jimi Hendrix Experience on drums, Keith Richards playing bass, when Bill Wyman could've sufficed. But Richards is, in his own way, as charismatic as Jagger, so I say good choice; it was a \\"super group\\" anyway; Eric Clapton on lead guitar (God he was young back then), and John Lennon as band leader. I thought their rendition of \\"Yer Blues\\" was as good as the version Lennon did with The Beatles. That other thing they did was thrown together at the last minute, obviously. Irvey Gitlis played a great solo on violin here, I don't even know who he is, but I can tell he's got a lot of talent. I've never understood Yoko Ono's contributions to these things; giving credit where it's due, she's a very creative woman, and she was the catalyst in Lennon's life for finding and redefining himself. She was good for him. But she has screamed into microphones in front of some of the most talented musicians in the world, and I'm tempted to ask, \\"why?\\" Call it a guilty pleasure, but listen to her songs on \\"Double Fantasy.\\" These are great songs, and she is actually carrying a tune there. I really like it, and that's what's frustrating; she's got an unusual voice, and it is abused and squandered on things like \\"Whole Lotta Yoko,\\" the number she sang at the R'n'R Circus. Did she have the first idea how much audiences hated her? The only real applause she ever got, as far as I could tell, was when she and John sat in with Zappa and the Mothers at the Fillmore. And that's because Zappa's fans, especially then, were open to almost anything.<br /><br />In all, this is a good investment, if nothing else, to see what the big names were doing in December of 1968. The music was so much better long ago...rismatic as Jagger, so I say good choice; it was a \\"super group\\" anyway; Eric Clapton on lead guitar (God he was young back then), and John Lennon as band leader.

B00005UEAR|2.0|It's truly painful to write two-star reviews for Dream Theater albums, but I must keep telling myself that we can't ever have another IMAGES AND WORDS or AWAKE simply because the band needs to grow, mature, and evolve with the times.  However, I refuse to rationalize myself into thinking records like THE SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE and OCTAVARIUM are worth an hour of my time.   <br /> <br />People will think I just don't like change, but that's not the case at all.  I'm just the opposite, actually - I listen to a plethora of musicians that evolved drastically such as John Zorn.  Zorn has hundreds of albums, and there are some I can think of that I'd give two star reviews as well.   <br /> <br />I honestly believe this could have been a great record if they only released the second disc.  The title track, broken up into several songs, is the real highlight here.  It's not as groundbreaking as say, 'A Change of Seasons' or 'A Mind Beside Itself,' but it would have been worthy of at least four stars.  My only complaint is that the parts don't necessarily fit in will.  What I mean is there's a part that sounds like Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs, and there's another track that sounds like Marillion.  There are heavy movements and slow ones as well.  The only problem is that they don't connect well to each other.  The mood shift is so drastic, that it doesn't feel like one song - it feels like several songs duct taped together.  The idea is great, but the delivery is poor. <br /> <br />The first disc is just a car wreck...a multi-car pileup.  'The Glass Prison' is a long, drawn out Metallica/Pantera style song, with a miniscule progressive element.  'Blind Faith' also should have been shortened.  I love long songs, but they cannot be this stale and bland.  'Misunderstood,' with it's Nirvana style lyrics could not be more predictable.  'Disappear' is a Tool/Radiohead rip-off, and those bands are terrible.  It's just a long drawn out song of nothingness...just album filler.  I think if Dream Theater tried playing that song live, I'd go home.   <br /> <br />The song that ultimately doomed this record is the 13-minute, 'The Great Debate.'  It's cool that Dream Theater would want to put out a song about the stem-cell debate.  What I cannot stand is that they only weigh out the two sides - they don't seem to make a clear decision.  It's nice to make the public aware of these issues, but you must make a stand as an artist.  I actually think they are leaning towards a more pro-life stand on the issue.  With lines like \\"are you justified in taking life to save life,\\" it is truly disheartening, because it's telling me the band is willing to recognize the possibility that abortion is a form of murder.  I don't want this Christian fundmanetalist propaganda in my progressive metal.  If this is true, it makes me want to vomit.  Whether they are pro-life or pro-choice shouldn't matter, as long as the music is good right?  Well not in this case...I mean what where they thinking?  The majority of the song sounds like Tool.  Is Dream Theater going through some sort of identity crisis?  I had to sit through this monster song *3* times on the SIX DEGREES tour and I think all three times I sat down and took a nap. <br /> <br />This record isn't as bad as FALLING INTO INFINITY, simply because Derek Sherinian is gone, and even though this album is laughable, the songs aren't as poor as 'You Not Me' or 'Burning My Soul'.  There IS some color to this music.  Dream Theater seems to release a great album at least every-other-time, so check out TRAIN OF THOUGHT, which I consider to be miles ahead of this record. <br /> <br />
B000063JDE|4.0|This is a good movie, but god, some of these positive reviews are so damn pretentious.  Personally, I don't buy that this film is nearly as complex as many are making it out to be.  I just think that Lynch thought it would be interesting to make a film that combined an exaggerated, cliched 50's sitcom style setting with a sexually violent, noir-ish type plot. (And he was right.)  And, even if the thematic stuff other people are discussing is in there, it earns few points from me.  \\"It's like, sex and violence are combined, man, and there's darkness and death even in the beautiful bourgeoise suburbs man, and it's all crap underneath it all, man, it's like whoa. dude, whoa\\"  I'm not saying these things aren't true to a certain degree: Bad things happen in the suburbs, bad stuff happened in the 50's, and there are sadists and masochists, people have a capacity for violence, even if they don't know it.  These things are all obviously true, so you get no credit from me for pointing them out.  But, again, I don't think Lynch actually cared much about that sorta thing.<br /><br />Certainly, this is an extremely weird film, but I can't understand why so many people are confused by it.  The plot is extremely simple:  Crazy, sadistic Booth has kidnapped a singer's(Dorothy Vallens) husband and child, and uses this leverage to procure sexual favors from her. A young man, Jeffrey, stumbles upon this situation, and wants to help.  There are specifics developments, but nothing very complicated.  The real interest in the film is in the contrast between the banal sitcom world of Jeffrey and the sadistic, noir underworld of Booth, and how they interact, and the way that they converge and influence one another.  So, this is essentially an exercise in style and form, but Lynch has the skill to pull it off.  The sitcom stuff is nicely done, with a bright clean town of innocent, shallow characters and pristine lawns.  It's an exaggeration, but Lynch wisely resists the temptation of straying too far from the source material.  I'd say we see this stuff a bit too much, as their isn't that much to it, but it never gets too tiresome, though it definitely could've been tighter.  The darker part of the picture centers on Dennis Hopper, as Booth.  His performance is pretty legendary, and not without good reason.  He's allowed to play it as over the top as possible with out quite verging into self-parody.  Suffice to say, he's a scary dude.  And while I've seen plenty of stuff that's worse than anything here, the violent, sadistic stuff in this movie is still pretty out there.  The films uses the now cliche tactic of combining graphic violence with an old, non-threatening pop song.  This method is used to better effect here than in any other film I can think of, particularly the great, 'In Dreams' part.  Quite a few people have raved about Rossellini's performance as Dorothy, but I think she's one of the weaker links. Frankly, she's kind of annoying, and is never really developed as a realistic, full character.  (Of course, I don't think she was ever intended to be all that realistic, so I suppose I can't really fault her for that.)  Fortunately, Booth is crazy enough that the fact that his main victim is just kinda weird doesn't matter all that much.<br /><br />Hmm, I guess I don't have too much to say.  The film has an interesting visual style and a novel central concept.  I don't think it's genius, but it works.<br /><br />Grade: B+far from the source material.

B0009MDPYW|1.0|Degrading and down right morbid horror movie that is more in tune with The Rocky Horror Picture Show than the comic book that it's based on. Keanu Reeves was just terrible as the lead character and he should be banned from ever acting again. Sadly, his performance was not the worse in the movie. That honor goes to the transvestite who plays the angel Gabriel, who looks like a reject from a John Walters movie. Her performance is beyond bad and along with the embarrassing performance of the guy who plays a gay devil make this one of the worse films to ever come out of hollywood.  The only and I do mean only good performance that comes out of this waste of film stock is from Rachel Weisz( Runaway Jury,Confidance) and her performance is so good in fact that in makes the movie uneven because you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen instead of the garbage that is right in front of you. You actually begin to feel sorry for her after a while and hope that she and her character was able to escape the movie all together.  <br /> <br />May become a cult classic but it deserves the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment more.  <br />

0385512058|3.0|I have to admit that during my read, I questioned \\"why did I want to read this book?\\"  My expectation was that Ferazzi would go deep into the art (science?) of networking and relationship building.  That's probably why I felt a bit let down after the read. The book does lay out good precepts underlying sound networking:  that we do need each other in life and in business; don't be so self-centered -- think about what you can do for the other person; do your due diligence before contacting people, etc.  But, it really isn't anything particularly new.  I got the impression that a kernel of an idea got swathed in Business 101 stuff -- like have a mission and develop a niche -- to fill out the book.  For a lot of business people, though, this background and filler is old hat that doesn't really get us closer to \\"how do you establish those initial connections?\\"  I was hoping that the chapter on Warming the Cold Call would reveal insights.  Instead, it was more of a demonstration on how he worked an already established network.  And, it appears that his network got kickstarted by virtue of his affiliation with Harvard or Deloitte. Building networks and deepening relationships with ordinarily inaccessible people may not be a function of the secrets contained within this book after all.  This is not to say that the read was uninteresting.  Ferazzi does show you what can happen when you have his DNA -- the unmitigated drive to connect with everyone with the slightest bit of celebrity.
B000006E4C|5.0|Whether you prefer the original ECM recording or you own the Nonesuch version, this work will blow your mind if you possess the patience.  The first time I heard \\"18\\" I was a freshman in college, listening to it with my composition major friend who swore by it.  I thought it was complete garbage.  Today, I will not only tell you that it is THE MOST influential piece of music in my life, but that it rewards me with something new everytime I listen to it.  If you own a set of those Bose noise cancelling headphone, this is the piece for which to use them.  This piece is intoxicating with its velvety and shimmering textures.  If you want to scan through it first, try Sections IIIA and VI.  Like all good \\"ambient\\" music, this piece is fine background music, but its real rewards come from an intense listening session.
B000002ADT|5.0|I consider my taste in music to be quite broad and sweeping (except, naturally, for rap - take a glance at my other reviews for evidence, if you care), but I'm aware that much of what I listen to (rock and related genres) cannot be considered high art. This, however, is high art that is truly universal in its accessibility.<br /><br />This is a recording that should be in every home, everywhere in the world.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|The radio release of \\"Widow\\" made me curious.  How could such a un-rock-like song end up on a mainstream rock station?  (Needless to say, it was not played often.)  I purchased the CD with no idea of what to expect.  What I found was a mesmerizing, operatic dream.  The CD jacket lists 15 tracks, but several tracks are strung together to draw you into a few epic journeys.  These journeys are turbulent and moody. <br /> <br />I'm really not sure why, but I loved this CD from the first time I listened to it.  I was encouraged to buy the debut CD from The Mars Volta: De-Loused in the Comatorium.  It too is hypnotic. <br /> <br />If you want mainstream rock, don't buy this CD.  If you have a curious and open mind, you need to listen to this.
0380789019|5.0|Probably the best urban fantasy novel I read. It might have gotten slightly old by now, but the spirit remains as fresh as it ever was. When I was reading it for the first time, the ending really made me think about where my life was going. <br />An absolute must for all young corporate associates and office rats.
0553583182|5.0|I've read several books on the powers of the subconscious mind and I must say that Dr. Murphy's book is the best one of the bunch!!.  He doesn't beat around the bushes with useless information and vain repititions that i've found in many other books.  He gets right to the source and shows the reader how, when and why you can actually give suggestions (I like to call the commands) to your subconscious mind and get results.  For anyone curious about the life-changing possibilities which \\"will\\" arrive from feeding your desires to your subconscious mind, then this book is an absolute much.  I began giving suggestions to my subconscious mind as soon as I started reading this book a few weeks ago and I've already witnessed trememdous results.
B000002H97|5.0|I know it's one of Metallica's best, in some respects better than Ride the Lightning or dare I say, Master of Puppets.  But I just wanna say, how come everyone disregards My Friend of Misery.  One of the band's best I might say.  Just thought I would say it.  If you like Metallica, listen to some At the Gates, Soilwork, Dark Tranquillity, and Darkest Hour.  Great Gothenburg bands.

0767834739|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil games. In fact, I denied that any other games existed for a long time. After seeing and, consequently, being disappointed in the first Resident Evil, I debated about seeing \\"Apocalypse\\" up until today. Having finally watched it, I am now qualified to write a review.<br /><br />Firstly, the lack of Claire and Leon is moderately distressing. I watched the entire first movie wondering if Milla Jovavich was supposed to be Claire or Jill. Seeing as her name is Alice, the mystery deepens.<br /><br />The action was decent, though highly unrealistic when correlated with game play. I know, I know, I'm being a nerdy purist, but the fact is, Alice kicks much ass with her hands and legs....have you ever tried killing one of those damn zombies with your handy dandy Bowie knife when you blew all your magnum bullets on the dogs? I think the game ends right there. Too much kung foo, and out of focus too.<br /><br />I understand a man's need to see girls in skimpy clothing and even blow some heads off and do a somersault over a motorcycle, but this is ridiculous. Jill's top would TOTALLY have buckled like a belt about 80 times during the film. She even had a bit more on in the game!!<br /><br />But I digress. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the movie, I'm just saying more people would find it more irritating if they had heard Milla Jovavich sing. Not quite the badass now, eh? I guess all we can do now is wait for Resident Evil 3....
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I'm so sick of reading, \\"But it's not like the comicbook. In the comicbook....\\" That isn't valid criticism--so what if it's not like the book--what point is being made here? None.  <br /> <br />Anytime a story switches mediums, expect it to be different. Sometimes it's slightly different, sometimes it's drastic; either way the new medium needs to be evaluated on its own; not judged on how closely it mirrors its source.   <br /> <br />For some reason, comicbook nerds don't seem capable of being that open minded. I've read the Hellblazer comics, and I've seen the Constantine movie, and I loved the movie--I bought it the day it came out. I did not expect the movie to be the same as the comic--I expected it to be an interpretation, and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it more than some comic nerds. The movie is well done all around--intriguing characters, an engaging plot, sharp directing and special effects, and solid action.  <br /> <br />If you want to see a dark fantasy movie about a guy hunting demons, and you're willing to put any preconceptions of the Hellblazer graphic novels aside, you will most likely love the movie. If you still can't get over the fact that movies based on books are interpretations, perhaps you should start staying away from medium changes (including this one) and find something more productive to complain about.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|After the bombastic Train Of Thought, this was a real let down. Just goes to show that great players don't always write great songs.After a weak opening track, I skip to track 5 . 2 tracks sound very similar after that with both being good tracks. I can't help but wonder who picked the order of these songs. Pace is everything in a set of music and this is way off-not good to listen to. The last song is basically a bunch of totally different sounding songs strung together one after the other. It is a listenable song though and one of my favorites of the bunch-good melodies and an interesting ELP sounding track stuck in there. After TOT this is a let down. I had high hopes for another killer-not so! They are always great live though and I know great bands have their flat albums or periods.Try Pagan's Mind if you liked Train Of Thought. Their new one is excellent as well as Celestial Entrance.Also try Symphony X.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Okay, let's face it, Keanu was not the guy who should have done this flick. Yes, he's pretty. But Constantine's character is really a down, dark guy doomed to hell. It needed an actor who could convincingly portray the emotions, that heavy negativism burying a nugget of hope that heaven might cut him some slack. I needed to see a face that reeked of internal putrefaction (the cancer, the despair) as well as obsession. We needed someone who could really dig in and pull out a performance. Keanu, photogenic as he is, even likable as he is, just can't do this. I don't believe him as a guy dying from lung cancer and well-acquainted with hellfire.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton are good, Rachel VERY good. Tilda seems to be ready to make a career on playing gender-benders (see ORLANDO). She has the look for it, I guess.<br /><br />I kept thinking, too, that Satan should be much more beautiful (the fallen angel of light) and much more threatening. (This guy was creepy, but hardly to the levels of a Lucifer.)  This movie reminded me of The Prophecy meets The Matrix meets Spawn. (And wasn't Gabriel also human-hating in The Prophecy?) But Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer was better than this guys, hands down--seductive, yet repulsive. Bring Viggo back!<br /><br />The effects were good. I enjoyed the \\"vacation gone really, really bad/The Day After\\" vision of hell. The demons were well done. I liked the apprentice guy, and wish they'd let him do a bit more.<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the ending very much. Then again, I'm not averse to happy endings. :) In fact, I love them. I would have given this a three if not for the hell scenes and the ending.<br /><br />Another negative: What was with the sound? About a fifth of what Keanu says is unintelligible. I had to rewind several times.<br /><br />Still, I sat through it and wasn't bored, even if I wasn't astonished or thrilled to bits. It's an okay fantasy ride. It's a watchable, if not terrific, couple hours of effects-laden Hollywood.<br /><br />Ah, but if only they'd gotten somebody else for Constantine!couple hours of effects-laden Hollywood. <br /> <br />Ah, but if only they'd gotten somebody else for Constantine!
B0000669JL|5.0|I love Bob Marley. His music is uplifting, pretty, and great to chill out to. This collection contains some of my favorite songs of his, including an amazing live rendition of No Woman, No Cry and many of his other classics. This was the first Bob Marley album I bought and I definately think its a great place to start.

I was not a real fan of the Eagles before and my husband told me to just listen to them for a moment and I did, and NOW I AM A BIG FAN of them.  The music is SUPER and I just LOVED the song \\"One Day at a Time\\" by Joe Walsh  -  ALL the songs were GREAT! Actually, This was the first time I ordered something from Amazon.com and I thought I was buying a CD. [...] Thanks for the opportunity to let you know my thoughts. Ireneski
B0009K7RTI|1.0|defending this movie is as bad as defending george lucas' new star wars movies. It should never have been made. its crap. no offense to those who liked it. As a film.... its bad. as a story... its bad.  <br /> <br /> watch it again from the point of view that there is something wrong with the portrayal of events taking place. Especially when compared to the world we live in, where every apathetic american could care less about starving children in africa. If we had napolean dynomites everywhere, which we probably do, then nothing will get done. No redeeming qualities about the characters or the movie. <br /> <br /> for once i agree with roger ebert
B00000K3D4|1.0|This movie is atrocious.  This may be the worst thing I have seen in my life, and I say that with the utmost sincerity.  Hoggle is not the mascot of the 20th century and never will be.  This movie manages one star because of its excellent, underappreciated unintentional humor that makes the most of this dark time in David Bowie's life.  Jennifer Connelly should have been banished from the world of acting.   <br /> <br />Anyone who can take this movie seriously needs to get out more.  It's just that bad.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|Others have described Bond in general and broken down and rated individual songs on this disc, so I'll just write my overall comments and say something about DVD side of this DualDisc. <br /> <br />I'm extremely pleased with this disc even though I own all of the previous alblums.  The collection of songs is a great overview of their career and includes 3 new tracks.  (There's actually a fourth exclusive bonus track not on this disc but available on a popular music commerical download service.)  The Sugarplum track was especially rewarding because it's a fun take on the Nutcracker piece that I enjoyed watching Bond play live in concerts in L.A. and Seattle.  The last track Carmina is fun and somehow reminds me of 50 cent...  <br /> <br />Bond's sound is \\"huge\\".  The mixing of string instuments with a pop/techno beat is refreshing and fun to listen to.  Yes, it's produced and mixed but you really have to hear the fusion of strings and synths and take it in as  whole.  Technically these four women are extremely talented.  I think one theme that best describes Bond is that it's fun.  If you have the opportunity to seem Bond live in concert you'll see them all truly enjoying what they're doing and you can't but help get drawn into the energy, enthusiasm and great music. <br /> <br />On this disc, the familiar songs from the previous albums sound remastered and the sound levels are equalized so listening to older tracks like Victory along with newer tracks like Explosive and Scorchio are a cohesive experience.  For newer Bond fans, world-inspired beats and themes like Fuego, Victory and Explosive will get you blood pumping!   <br /> <br />Technically, certain tracks do sound a bit different that the original alblum releases even though they are not credited as different remixes.  One such track is Wintersun which I don't believe is the original U.S. album version.  In any case the overall start to finish of this CD is a great musical escape. <br /> <br />I'll make the assumption in that in remixing the tracks for the DualDisc 5.1 Multi-channel side of this collection that the CD tracks were tweaked at the same time. <br /> <br />So what's on the DVD side of this disc?  This was my first DualDisc which has CD info on one side and DVD info on the other side of a single disc.  On the DVD side you'll find some mulitmedia treats like three Bond music videos, Explosive, Fuego, Victory, a Photo Gallery, Discography, and all the album tracks in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.  So you'll need to put this in your home theater setup to fully appreciate the multichannel mixes. <br /> <br />If I remember, there were two different surround modes, one being Victory mix.  The multichannel tracks were a great experience and new interpretation of the songs.  If you're new to multichannel music, my take on it is that you're at the mercy of the sound engineers as to where they move and place certain instruments in the surround sound experience.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it sounds too forced and unnatural.  In this case there is good use of the rear channels to immerse you in each Bond track.  They didn't \\"overdo\\" it.  It's fun and a different way to listen to music so try it on your own and enjoy!  For the average person without a mid to higher end stereo system, you'll experience a bigger sound with the multichannel mixes on a home theater system.  Those of you with mid to high end stereo systems will revel in a great two channel experience.  Either stero or multichannel, you can't go wrong. <br /> <br />My first DualDisc experience was a great one and what a bonus that Bond was the artist!  This disc is highly recommended.  Thumbs up on both sides.  Even if you don't listen to the multichannel tracks, the videos on the DVD side are fun to watch.  And fun is the key word.  This is Bond, have fun with it!  This DualDisc is a must for all Bond fans! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0743487478|1.0|Two words for this book - not realistic. I really think this book is all about his way of parenting his child which properly works for him. Does it ever occur to him that every family has different needs and routines so \\"his way\\" will not work for every families. I think Parenting is a very complex and versatile knowledge. But he gives me a \\" only his way or the highway\\" kind of feeling. I mean if he thinks that addressing yourself as \\"Mommy\\" is going to distant the relationship ( maybe he is right).But then again, does it occurs to him that the child's understanding of the word \\" Mommy\\" can be comfort, safe, reassurance and love. I think the book is too subjective. I agree with his \\"love and reason\\" way but \\" rewards and punishments\\" are also essential in parenting. I really don't see that a child will sit there and reason with you all the time. So my conclusions is take this book as a reference. I mean it won't hurt to learn more if you have the time and the $. But totally disagree with his point of view on what he thinks is negative or wrong.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|\\"Annie\\" was one of the best Broadway musicals of the past 30 years. It relied on content and talented performers instead of high-tech sets and lighting and un-taltented stars. Andrea McArdle as the loveable orphan was actually 13 as the perfect age to play Annie, who was I believe 12 in the stage show. She had a great voice and was tougher than the usual little girl. As Oliver Warbucks, Reid Sheldon was comic and warmhearted and as the beloved Miss Hanigan, Dorothy Loudon was a cynical, boozing broad, just as the charachter was written. <br />In 1982, Hollywood put its rather dull and child-like stamp on \\"Annie.\\" Not only does this Annie- Aileen Quinn have a horrible voice, but is also cutesy and phony. Albert Finney as Warbucks, although he looks the part, doesn't act the part. There is no pompus humor. As Miss Hanigan, Carol Burnett get the drinking part right, but that's about all she does through the whole movie. Ms. Burnett, although rather funny throughout the film, acts like a drunk through the whole thing. The characther is more than than. <br />I am a huge fan of Bob Fosse, and Ann Reinking is one of his best dancers, however for this film, her taltnents were not shown. She was miscast for the role of Miss Farrel. <br />The story was completely revamped to make Miss Hannigan look like a nice charachter. There was also no Arab servant in the stage show. <br />The music was changed drastically. Did you know \\"Tomorrow\\" was actually a scene change song in the Broadway show? Well here it is song constantly, terribly as well. \\"We Got Annie\\" was planned as a song in the Broadway show, but here is sung by a bunch of people who we don't care about. It isn't particulary good here anyway. <br />And \\"Dumb Dog\\" doesn't even count as a song. Although the song about the contract invovling Warbucks in Hannigan was comic, it too was dull. <br />\\"Annie\\" is perhaps the worst stage to screen musicals. How could they ruined this well-written masterpiece?
B00030590I|4.0|Director Zhang Yimou is the best China has!  In 'Hero', he wraps fable, history, adventure and myth together in a cinematographically stunning epic.<br /><br />Basically, the tale is the story of the first Chin emperor, the man who unified China, and the plots within plots of the rival kindoms' assassins who try to stop him.  Told from multiple viewpoints, scenes are oft-repeated and altered, depending on the narrative point.  This device is re-enforced by soundtrack, color, and camera work.  It is magnificent.<br /><br />If you've never seen Jet Li act, or never seens Zhang Yimou's other films (such as my favorite, \\"Shanghai Triad\\"), you are in for a treat!<br /><br />I took a single star off the top because the high-wire martial arts scenes were wonderfully-choreographed but just a little over the top, ala 'Crounching Tiger'.  Otherwise, a delight, a classic, and worth many watchings.  Subtle, complex, visually sumptuous.<br /><br />For my fellow Mandarin speaks, the Chinese is nice and clear--<br /><br />Kaolu, xingming zhong, da duo shu shi Xiang Gangde, tamen'de putonghua zhen bu cuo!
B00005JNSK|5.0|I was satisfied with the new edition of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\\" Johnny Depp definitely displays a Michael Jackson quality to him, however, he instead resists the touch of children (no pun intended).  <br />The single Oompa Loompa is hysterical and overwhelming. The scenery is excellent, up to date, and more believable than the plastic props used in the older version. This Willy Wonka is creepier, nerve-racking, and saddening to watch. An abused and neglected child (who wouldn't be if they were given no sweets?) who turns into a genius and gives away his factory after seeing a gray hair is captivating.  <br />The movie remains true to the book, a quality I look for when seeing movie versions of novels. It is almost as if the entire script WAS from the book. <br />If you are looking for a heartwarming tale and a family movie, you won't find it here. It is odd, a different kind of funny, and memorable.
0743487478|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer who said you have to leave what you have been programmed to do as a parent behind. The ubiquitous \\"time outs\\" and \\"good jobs!!!!!!!!!!\\" that most parents subscribe to which confront you everywhere you go give parents a false sense of security. Just because most parents (and sadly some educators) are employing these methods do not make them right or healthy. Spanking was big when I was growing up; everybody did it - but now we know how just plain wrong it is!  <br /> <br />This book requires an open mind, courage, patience and creativity. Mr. Kohn does not deliver the answers for you but he gives you tools to find the answers for your own unique child. He will make you think wholly and truly about the kind of parent you want to be and the kind of child you are helping to shape with your words and actions. Moving away from rewards and punishments (which is sadly regarded as unorthodox in our society!) is a bold parenting move, one that requires a steadfast conviction that our children come first and our relationship with them is fostered more by love and reason NOT by the carrot-stick mentality used to train animals. For the reviewers who say that kohn's ideas are not realistic; yes, it's hard to incorporate these ideas into your life - the question you have to ask yourself is: Is it worth it? To that I say an emphatic YES! <br /> <br />His other book: The Schools our Children Deserve is excellent as well.
6304696566|4.0|John Ford is an inventive director. This is, without a doubt, true from every shot in 'the Searchers'. The details of the film are extraordinary, and you can see why Orson Welles was so enthralled by the man and his movies.<br /><br />John Wayne is very aptly cast in this - probably his best film.<br /><br />What grabs me the most is the epic style of the photography - the play of light and color - which must have been so exciting to see when the film came out.<br /><br />My perspective as a viewer in 2005 is what brings this one down to 4 stars for me (a personal decision). Although I see this film as a classic, even a masterpiece, I just cannot bare some of the racism that comes out at times.. I try to filter out this aspect - I mean all film is a product of its time and place - but my own personal perspective is very hard to shake. This does not take away from the very obvious brilliance that I do see in this film, however, and the genius of John Ford does shine through.
B000002TQV|5.0|this is for everyone out there who thinks the album is really good because it got an average review of 4.5 stars or whatever. TRY TO FIND AN ALBUM WITH A RATING OF LESS THAN 4 STARS. its tough trust me ive tried. think of the worst album you can and it will still get an average rating of 3 stars. Anyway, i think this album is really good and it jumpstarted the alt-rock scene in the nineties. I also think that radiohead is one the few bands that can mature their sound without \\"selling out\\" and just pump out albums with a load of singles on it. I also think that o.k. computer is overrated. I remeber when it came out and it was the hugest deal. I think that it is a very good album but not as good as everyone makes it out to be. It certainly is not better than the bends. Too many nonsense tracks.

B00005JNSK|3.0|If you were to take a glance back upon director Tim Burton's rather humble beginnings as an animator for the Walt Disney Company, his work, albeit unaccredited, appearing in such full-length animated feature films as The Fox and the Hound and The Black Cauldron in the 1980s, you would think you were staring at an entirely different individual from the one audiences are quite familiar with today. Following the moderate success of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, just one of the few projects Burton has taken on which have raised eye-brows given his particular taste for the strange and bizarre, he solidified his ability to direct on the big screen with two back-to-back box office successes, Beetle Juice (1988) and Batman (1989). Starting with Batman Returns, the follow-up to the original Batman film which, though certifiably a box office hit, did not live up to what audiences had come to expect, Burton experienced a bit of a slump which continued with Ed Wood and Mars Attacks. Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, returned Burton back to form, grossing nearly one-hundred million dollars by the end of its domestic run in theaters. Director Tim Burton collaborates with Johnny Depp once more, this being the fourth time together with the fifth being Corpse Bride which opens this fall, for his most eccentric project yet - an adaptation of the classic Ronald Dahl children's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Be assured that this has not gone without its fair share of controversy from purists, being they few and far between, of the Gene Wilder musical version. <br /> <br />The story for Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, albeit certainly a substantial improvement from the ridiculously overwrought musical production from the 1970s starring Gene Wilder, falls into the unsavory formalities which have come to mar the summer family feature, complete with wall-to-wall clichs, failing to separate itself from the rest of the pack with the exception of Burton's conventional oddities which are common knowledge amongst movie theater patrons. Applause should be given at the very least to director Tim Burton for remaining so true to the source material on which the film is based, having the family of the late-Ronal Dahl publicly endorsing the film upon it entering production last year. However, those unfamiliar with the classic children's novel, even if only in recent years, may want to read up on it if only not to be caught off guard by the film's gothic and semi-sadistic overtones and atmosphere. And although the inclusion of a background story for a leading characters, set up via a series of flashbacks, seems a logistical decision on the part of the filmmakers and was effective enough in director Ron Howard's live-action adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on the other hand based its material on a full-length children's novel with more then enough material to go on without having to resort to stretching it as they did. Furthermore, background information pertaining to Willy Wonka's childhood and what shaped him into the eccentric candy innovator he is today eliminates the mystery, grandeur and allure the classic children's character has sustained for decades and what has made him the memorable figure he is. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp, a regular headliner for director Tim Burton with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory being their fourth collaboration together, is amusing, if not a bit eerie, in the lead role of Willy Wonka. Supposedly, if rumors are to be believed, Johnny Depp beat out fellow competitors such as heteromorphic punk rocker Marilynn Manson for the role. Now imagine how messed up this film would have been had he been given the role. Depp who channeled British rocker Keith Richards for his outlandish performance as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl does essentially the same thing with Willy Wonka, only instead of rock n' roll he instead switches genres and imitates the vagarious behavior of pop-star Michael Jackson. It only makes sense that Depp, playing a whimsical industrial innovator with no distinct memories of his childhood and a defiant animosity to parental authority, would choose to base his performance and appearance off Michael Jackson. Obviously this does nothing in the way of comforting parents wanting to take their children to see this film but credit should be given to Johnny Depp for pushing the envelope in delivering unique, if not a bit odd, performances. Let us hope that the irony of John Depp channeling pop-star and potential pedophile Michael Jackson in a remake of the classic Ronald Dahl novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fresh off his Academy Award-nominated performance in Finding Neverland is not lost on today's audiences. <br /> <br />In spite of his charm, Jack Albertson's sportive Grandpa Joe from the 1971 Gene Wilder musical Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is in no way imitated in the performance of Irish actor David Kelly. This in turn makes the following version of Grandpa Joe all the more relatable to our own grandfathers, elderly and decrepit in physical stature and yet filled with enough spark in him at times to be almost childlike in nature, such as when Charlie discovers the last remaining golden ticket. Christopher Lee, much in the same way as Vincent Prince did in Burton's Edward Scissorhands before him, performs magnificently opposite Johnny Depp, giving a slightly bizarre and twisted perspective on the judging and yet loving father figure which shapes the son's future in defiance of his the father's best intentions. Sadly, the character of Dr. Wonka, Willy's father, decreases the imaginative mystery surrounding the classic character of Willy Wonka considerably and leads only to a rather bland and pedestrian finale, albeit a step above the Gene Wilder rendition. <br /> <br />The problem with the character of Charlie Bucket lies not withinthe splendid performance of the young Freddie Highmore who also appeared alongside Johnny Depp in the Oscar nominated Finding Neverland but instead with the character himself. Sure, Charlie's purpose is to serve as the perfect foil to the other four children who are spoiled, rotten little punks who deserve whatever they have coming to them. Sadly, his personal quality is so positive, upbeat, and righteous that he is given an almost saint-like status significantly diminishing his connection with audiences. One of the very few positive aspects which can be said of the Gene Wilder musical adaptation of the Ronald Dahl novel is that it was able to make Charlie the polar opposite of the other bratty children on the chocolate tour but allowed him to remain a bit `mischievous' enough, with the help of his Grandpa Joe, to retain his humanity in the eyes of audiences who could easily relate to him. True, there was the scene in which Charlie discovers money lying in a snow bank and instead of using it to provide for his poverty-stricken family he rushes to the local convenience store to purchase a Wonka bar for himself. But seeing as how he ended up receiving the fifth and last golden ticket within that very candy bar he purchased in the convenience store, it will undoubtedly go unnoticed by audiences. <br /> <br />Annasophia Robb is completely contemptuous as the inordinately competitive Miss Violet Beauregarde whose trademark is her ability to chew a single piece of gum for three months solid in spite of its loss of taste. The same however can not be said of her robust blue berry colored counterpart who in the eyes of Charlie's audiences strikes as being glaringly computer-animated. The fat suit, both back then and now, may seem a bit ridiculous, if not a bit laughable in light of the tremendous success of computer animation in Hollywood blockbusters, but it at least felt a bit more believable then a computer animated Annasophia Robb blown up to resemble a gigantic blue-berry. Nothing, not even computers, can exactly duplicate the likeness of a human being, even if they happen to be a fat-suit and dyed blue. And Jordan Fry is easily the least memorable child cast member in the role of Mike Teavee, a golden ticket winner who, surprisingly, lavishes in technology, particularly television, and expresses no interest in the production of chocolate or other `dumb' ideas. The musical number which marks his departure from the tour does not work as effectively as the others. Scenes imitating such memorable moments as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shower scene only add to the quirkiness of the production. <br /> <br />Overall, Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not so much a failure, far be it from that to be sure, as it is a disappointment particularly to those who had such high expectations following the director's critically acclaimed Big Fish, this in spite of it's lack of award recognition, that this adaptation of the classic Ronald Dahl novel would be a step in the proper direction. Albeit far from the abomination which was the Gene Wilder musical Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the manipulated title being just the beginning of the project's lengthy laundry list of problems, the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp presentation is honestly nothing beyond mediocre and has its own fair share of issues. For one, no matter how much actor Johnny Depp denies to the entertainment media that he did not base the eccentric behavior of the lead Willy Wonka on pop-star Michael Jackson, there are too many similarities and congruities between the two in this film for it to be merely a coincidence. How nave and stupid does Johnny Depp think we are? It is not an issue of criticism, although at moments it certainly crosses the line in becoming down right creepy particularly with young children in the audience who may or may not understand the parallel mannerisms between the two figures, as it is an annoyance for Depp not to fess up to his portrayalof Willy Wonka. Yet another dispute is that specific special effects shots, which would include among others the blown-up Violet Beauregarde and the diminutive Oompa Loompas, all of which are performed by British actor Deep Roy, come off as being too artificial which presents quite an unnecessary distraction for the audience. Other points of critique would include the haphazard background story of Willy Wonka which diminishes significantly the grandeur and illusion of the character when his outlandish behavior is blamed on `daddy not understanding him', awkward moments such as when the dolls singing the `Willy Wonka Theme Song' suddenly catch on fire or when Willy proclaims `Good morning sunshine, the Earth says hello' that do nothing for the plot and are not the least bit amusing, and finally the finale which wraps things up too neatly and feels a bit anti-climatic to say the least. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a welcome diversion from adult-oriented features flooding the market place, which would include Wedding Crashers and The Island, for the younger set but retains no distinctive value that would make it anything more then that.
B000000OYN|3.0|This album rocks all the way through. I much rather older<br /><br />Whitesnake than the harder 90's stuff. The production is<br /><br />awesome as usual with Martin Burch at the helm. Can't say<br /><br />enough good things about this album. Not a clunker on it!<br /><br />Some of the new rockers could learn from listening to this!
B000002GWN|3.0|Two albums into her Asylum contract came this double album recorded live in California in 1974. Treading water prior to her next studio album a full year later (The Hissing Of Summer Lawns), the album also usefully provided Asylum with shiny new versions of some of her Reprise back catalogue, at a time when her vocal style had matured. Some of these now sounded considerably different, having been rearranged to incorporate the LA Express, the band led by Tom Scott with whom Joni had been working since their involvement on the Court And Spark album released at the start of the year. Perversely though, the one song from that album, People's Parties, is performed live acoustically.<br /><br />Big Yellow Taxi, Woodstock, Carey, The Last Time I Saw Richard and Both Sides Now in particular appear in marked contrast to their studio counterparts, making them of some interest whether or not in the final analysis they are improvements. The album concludes with two previously unrecorded songs, Jericho (later to appear on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter) and Love Or Money.<br /><br />Most of the concert was recorded over four August nights at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheater and mixed to create the atmosphere of a single live performance (though two of the tracks come from earlier concerts at different venues in March). However, much of this atmosphere has been sacrificed on this CD in an attempt to squeeze the albums onto to one disc. With the exception of Joni's amiable preamble to The Circle Game, all the between song chat and some of the applause has been crudely excised, with applause frequently being unceremoniously cut short by the clean start of a new track. As the running time is only 74 minutes, one hopes that any HDCD remastered edition will be able to restore this album to something approaching the whole, in line with the original production intentions
B000001FTA|5.0|From soldier  to killer this rocks! and then slows down a bit with the last 3 songs but still a killer album. I think the production is a little too smooth and should've had a little more edge to it but yadayada there is still nothing out there today that can touch this!Opium Trail and Bad Reputation are two of Lizzy's best and I was upset when they didn't appear on the live album? I don't get that decision but if you find live versions of them get them also because they rock live. Great album once again from Lizzy!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|This is an awesome CD.  It may seem like they are declining but they could have made this CD as good as any other if they combined the two CD's.  Not quite as good as One by One but still good. <br /> <br />Highlights include: No Way Back, Best of you, DOA(best), Resolve, End over end, Miracle, Over and Out, What if I do, Cold Day in the sun (60's/70's Monkey's sound to it).  The rest is very Mediocre to me.  The rock CD isn't blow away heavy, there's just constant screaming that gets annoying after a while.  The acoustic CD is excellent, melodic, and easy to listen to.  Good for people of any age. <br /> <br />As for this Copy Protection stuff, you complainers need to learn how to follow instructions. The CD comes with instructions to get around Copy protection, and if you follow screen that comes up when the CD runs, it says \\"download songs to your computer\\".  I have the entire CD on my Mp3 player.  You can even burn the CD.  Also, the CD's work on any CD player, DVD player, or anything else that doesn't require a computer. <br /> <br />All in all a good CD.  The only good rock CD's released in the past year other than True Parallels from TRUSTcompany and Thornley's CD.
B00003OO3O|5.0|This is pure raw hard rock power from a classic rock band<br /><br />that critics and radio overlooked. Much better than Zeppelin<br /><br />and the other so called rock gods of the time. This plays<br /><br />like a live album and just rocks. It's still my favorite UFO<br /><br />album and I can't say enough how I recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />UFO is still playing and sound as good as ever. UFO!
B0009MDPYW|3.0|Constantine touched on some pretty good subjects but as always in a Keanu Reeves movie, his acting abilities always fall short.  He can only perform certain parts convincingly and the role he attempts in this film is no exception!  The special effects and music score were well done and had there been a better actor in the part of Constantine I think the movie would have faired a lot better.  I watch movies (all types) for entertainment and this was the reason I rented this one.  If they make a sequel will I view it?  You betcha!  Even for 2 hrs. it's a great escape from the work-world we live in......Thank God for Hollywood!!
1400032717|5.0|Thiss book is written so simple and in such an innocent tone that catches your attention and keeps you involved with it all along. A great story and very funny even though the protagonist might deny it.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I got this for 29 bucks at Best Buy.  It was awesome because I have been listening to Michael Jackson my whole life.  The man is a genius.  Sadly he is insane, and he is losing it with all the surgeries and whatnot.  The music is still great!  This Place Hotel makes me just jam, as does the demo of PYT (No offense to uber talent James Ingram) but the demo is in my opinion more beautiful, sexy and sweet.  I love to hear this one, it does bump even if its over 20.  The songs on disc 4 are something strange to me.  No one seems to notice that Fall Again (written by Robin \\"When I Get You Alone\\" Thicke) was scrapped by Jackson as he found it too poppy, and substituted by Speechless (one of the only duds on Invincible) was actually picked up by Glenn Lewis and performed on the film and soundtrack Maid in Manhattan.  In the back was written for \\"Get on the Bus\\" but wasn't included because Spike Lee believed it wasn't Black enough.  The track Beautiful Girl verges on Elevator pop, while The Way You Love Me, while mis-named and sung (I love the way \\"how\\" you love me??) is one of my favorites.  Also watch out for the keyboard overload that is \\"We Are Here to Change the World\\"  Also for those who wonder where's all the Paul McCartney stuff?? Michael and Paul haven't been friends since 1989, they fought over the Beatles catalog and of course using the songs so numerously would create a reason for MJ to give PM royalties.  Stop wondering.  Paul and Mike are no more.  I do however wish that the underrated neo soul classic One More Chance from Number Ones was included, it truly is one of his better latter day singles.  Also missing for whatever the hell reason is once again Scream with his sister Janet.  I know she too is a controversy queen and also it would have him giving her royalties, seeing as shes on Virgin Records.  It does deny us little people who pay for stuff, but I can just pull out my HISTory CD. The concert DVD point blank sucks.  The singer on \\"I just can't stop loving you\\" is not the talented Siedah Garrett, rather a backup singer who is cheaper to keep around than Siedah, tramping it up on stage in thigh high boots.  She is good though.  The dated everything in the show doesn't help and seeing all those foreign people screaming and getting carried away made me just stop the DVD.  The Garden performance was 100% amazing, even with the likes of Crackhead Whitney Houston and sexpot/mama Britney Spears.  That would have ultimate'd this collection through the roof.  I love jackson so this ehh collection gets 5 stars.  Love the songs and rarities, but I would be willing to shell out more for a box set with all the songs u want, all the songs you've never heard and some interviews like the interesting and open minded quincy jones interviews from the special edition album reissues.  That would have made for a bigger collection but well worth it.  You'll see, its good but not great!! Thanks for reading this!!
B0002X314C|3.0|I personally was dissapointed in the debut album of John Legend.I enjoyed his first two singles,and could not wait to purphase his cd. As I am writing this, I am listening to his cd, and it is redundant. Obviously with a couple of listens, you know immediatly that it is a love album, which I am fine with but on every song! He basically says throughout the whole cd, that I can change, your the one for me, all of that.I just wanted to hear a variety of subject matter on the cd.I love his voice, and he is a breath of fresh air, but I guess by song 7 I was hoping for some happy upbeat songs.Also, he has a song about him cheating and telling his significant other that he can change even though he has said that before,which i did not like that at all,i guess because of the song's content.From a one to a ten, I would have to give this cd a 6, which I hate to do because he so talented and he will surely be around for years to come.
0316172324|2.0|Gladwell is an entertaining writer, I'll give him that. I did enjoy reading this book. However, it's not about the substance for him. He is basically reaching for something we all sorta kinda know about, but is not at all scientific or expository. The best book on doing without doing, thinking without thinking, intuition, the sense of self, self-knowledge, and the mecahnics behind all of this, is, by far, God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam. Not only does it deliver what readers likely expect from a book like Gladwell's, but it does in the context of world-shaking issues. If you want to know what thought is, not to mention supermental knowledge, look elsewhere.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Okay I'm not a Comic book nerd.... I like special effects and vivid flames flying at me!  There is nothing wrong with this movie... Yes yes Keanu reeves is still an average actor, the story line is crazy and way out there, but that's what I LIKE about it!!!  The cool good versus evil story is awesome!  I would recommend anyone with a pulse that likes action movies with a twist of horrow, rent this movie!  At least rent it, or buy it!  There is no reason why people should be on here bashing the fact that this isn't true to the comic it's based on, I've never really believed in the idea that Movie Producers actually wanted to stay close to a comics story, because it's impossible simply because they're two different subsidiaries!  all right that's all I have to say.

0767818040|4.0|The DVD actually contains a cropped fullscreen version of the film, not the original widescreen version.    [...] Body Double is currently only available in a fullscreen version.    My 4-star rating is for the film, not the DVD.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|The new BG is ultimately about what it means to be human in a world threatened by non-humans who appear human and who are your best friends or your worse enemies or, or, or ... BG's ultimately about the essence of life, not of machines or explosions or tactics or politics. And Bear's wonderful, varietal, colorful, subtle, sophisticated and always surprising work on Season One reflects this essence.  <br /> <br />\\"Wander My Friends\\" -- baleful, soulful piece. Time for tears. <br />\\"Battlestar Muzaktica\\" -- cheeky, smooth, unexpected. Time for laughter! <br />\\"The Dinner Party\\" -- classy, clean, sparse. Time for a little sherry. <br />\\"Battlestar Operatica\\" -- sneaky as a Cylon, hidden messages. Time for a chuckle. <br />\\"Passacaglia\\" -- Time for awe. Everyone else has mentioned this track and for good reason. It's the piece that, when heard on TV, I, and everyone else I hope, knew that we were in the presence of something quite different -- real epic television and a synching of creative vision that will continue to impress us every week. <br /> <br />Bear creates from the entire range of human experience. We could not have hoped for, or received, a better continuation of the unique sounds created for the pilot mini-series. <br /> <br />As exec producer David Eick says in the liner notes, the series was to change the face of science fiction. Bear's interpretative, evocative creations have changed the face of teevee scoring, and are a large part of why BG is the best fracking series on television today. <br /> <br />Long live the Bear. <br /> <br />
0385720920|5.0|Palahniuk spins a tale of the destructive tendencies of modern society and the means through which individuals seek escape from the restraints of civilization. The manner in which he does so is very creative. A nice piece of existentialist/postmodernist literature.
B00001U0E1|5.0|There were numerous good movies that were released in 1998; \\"The Truman Show\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Elizabeth\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line\\" to name a few. However, what made \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" stand out from the rest of them? When I saw Shakespeare in Love, I thought it was a breath of fresh air from the usual love stories that we usually see. It stood apart from the others, because of its unique storyline, unlike anything that I had seen before. <br /> <br />\\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is the story of young Will Shakespeare, who is having trouble coming up with ideas for his new play \\"Romeo and Ethel: The Pirate's Daughter\\". Irritated and nervous, Will suffers from this writer's block, until he meets Viola De Lesseps, whom he falls in love with. Viola is however, engaged to Lord Vessex (Colin Firth), who makes sure nothing comes in his way from marrying Viola. Meanwhile, Viola, who is in love with the theatre, disguises herself as a boy to try out for a role in Will's new play. Will they able to complete the play in time? Will \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" be successful and approved by anyone? Will Viola and William have their happy ending? <br /> <br />Winner of 7 Academy Awards (Best Picture , Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score), 3 Golden Globe Awards (Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Screenplay - Motion Picture),  with a total of 42 wins and 59 nominations from other awards, \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" does not give the autobiographical life story of William Shakespeare in anyway. Instead it just tells us a simple story of a young man falling in love and getting inspired to write new work. The screenplay for this movie is without a doubt, excellent. To nicely intersperse the story of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Twelfth Night\\" into this movie, was delightful to watch. It is such an exclusive concept to create a movie such as this. This film is like a rollercoaster ride, where you get too see love, comedy, tragedy, beauty, everything rolled into one! <br /> <br />Coming to the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful job in her role. She definitely deserved the Oscar for the expressions she portrayed when enacting on stage as Thomas Kent, while looking wonderful and acting gracefully as Viola. Joseph Fiennes acted great too as Will Shakespeare, and the chemistry between him and Viola was charming. Even though John Madden did not win the Oscar, he did a terrific job in directing this movie! The rest of the cast equally, such as Geoffrey Rush, Judi Dench and Colin Firth did a fine job on their roles. Rupert Everett and Ben Affleck were ok, but they didn't have much of a role in the movie anyway. Stephen Warbeck should also be credited for the beautiful background score that he created for this movie. <br /> <br />\\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is a movie that will have something for everyone. So if you want your spirits lifted, you should watch this masterpiece.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park has succeeded in combinding the musical attributes of boy bands, gangsta rap, and Korn into one tasteless, unpalateable mess.
6305696071|5.0|I had not seen this movie in a long time so I decided to get it and watch it again. Even after all these years, I still enjoyed watching this movie.    \\"Pretty Woman\\" is about Edward Lewis (Richard Gere), a wealthy millionaire who is really bad with long term relationships. Enter Vivian (Julia Roberts), a prostitute that Edward accidentally meets to ask for directions. Edward feels something for her, and pays her to stay a week with him. However, during the week, they soon start falling for one another. But will they do anything to further their relationship?    This movie made Julia Roberts rise to stardom, and gave her an Oscar nomination too (which she deserved). She acted her role as the street smart Vivian Woods very well. Richard Gere also acted nicely as Edward Lewis. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gere and Roberts is sweet and original in the movie (and they also pair up with Garry Marshall in \\"Runaway Bride\\"). The soundtrack for this movie adds well to the scenes. For example, Roxette's \\"It Must Have Been Love\\" when Edward and Vivian are separating from one another, or \\"Fallen\\" by Lauren Wood, when they are going to the Opera, adds nicely to the film. It gives a more 90s look to the film, which you don't see anymore these days. The DVD is not too bad either. It does have an audio commentary by Garry Marshall, along with the usual extras such as deleted scenes, theatrical trailers and production notes.    Basically, a fairy tale movie with a little reality added to it. If you liked this movie, some other movies that I would recommend are \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" and \\"13 going on 30\\".
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|First, let me address the polarized political zealots. The US is neither the greatest country on earth nor a despotic Nazi dictatorship, but a first world country among many. The US government has provided questionable leadership as of late, but this does not make the average US citizen evil or a malefactor to the rest of the world. I really don't see how political views would make a difference on how you view the musical content of an album, anyways. <br /> <br />This album's musical content is no different from all the other nu-metal acts out there today. The mallcore has a slightly different flavor due to an unconventional vocalist and \\"provocative\\" lyrics, but at the end of the day, it's the same quality and displays the same amount of originality. The riffs are downtuned for the effect of making the songs appear heavier and covering up the lack of riffing diversity. The lack of solos further drives this point home. Were you to remove the lyrics from any of these songs, you'd quickly realize that all the songs are comprised of arrangements of the same four barre chords. The basswork and drumming is no better, displaying a total lack of technical initiative. If MVT has convinced you that this sort of music is good, go for it. Otherwise, stay away.
B00005MP58|5.0|I was a little skeptic when I got A&E/BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", because I read that its running time was 6 hours. Imagine watching a movie stretching for 6 hours! But having heard so much praise about it, I decided to see the movie for sometime. Once I started watching the movie, I didn't realize the time fly by, and saw myself putting one disc after another, watching the entire movie in a single sitting! After watching it, I decided that this is once of the best TV movies made ever. <br /> <br />Nominated for 4 Emmy Awards (Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing for a Miniseries or a Special, Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special (winner), Outstanding Miniseries and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Choreography), \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" revolves around relationships, betrayal, jealousy, and above all, a wonderful love story between two people. The relationship between Mr. Darcy and Eliza Bennett, Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, Lydia Bennett and George Wickham, joined by Mrs. Bennett's wailing, Lydia and Kitty's childish pranks, the evil Caroline Bingley, and the snobbish Catherine de Bourgh kept me interested in the movie. <br /> <br />The chemistry between Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is wonderful, keeping us interested in them for 6 hours. The rest of the cast were also wonderful, particularly Julia Sawalha (Lydia Bennett), Susannah Harker (Jane Bennett), Crispin Bonham-Carter (Charles Bingley), Adrian Lukis (George Wickham) and Alison Steadman (who played Mrs. Bennett). Simon Langton did a terrific job in directing this fantastic series (which I am sure is not easy, if you have to direct a movie that will keep the audience interested for such a long period). Of course, the major credit for the movie has to go the background score, and the costumes/sets for the movie. The people behind did a costume design did a wonderful job in giving the characters an elegant yet simple look, meshing well with the era timeline of the story. <br /> <br />All in all, whether you are a Jane Austen fan or not, you should see this movie if you like watching romantic movies. This is a wonderful movie which should not be overlooked.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I not only dislike this CD or the band that produced it for claiming to be extreme metal when they're not, like most like-minded reviewers, but take offense at the idea of crafting songs without solos or any other possible measurement of technical prowess. Drop d tuning and riffs that are composed of the same 3 chords played repeatedly are what make this mallcore garbage truly unpalateable. That, and vocals that are either gangsta rap, whiny and accompanied by teenage angst lyrics, or screamed vocals that are simply worthless when compared to real vocalists, whether they be clean or dirty. All in all, this album, this band, and this genre are the absolute musical pit.
B000683VI4|5.0|I enjoyed watching \\"A Walk to Remember\\", and reading \\"Message in a Bottle\\" so I decided to see \\"The Notebook\\" based on Nicholas Sparks' first best-selling novel.  After watching this movie, I can say that this movie had everything that I expected it to have (it lived up to my expectations). Having all the elements that Nicholas Sparks usually puts into his novels, \\"The Notebook\\" succeeds in being a good love story. <br /> <br />\\"The Notebook\\" is a simple story of a poor boy falling in love with a rich girl with a lot of obstacles in their way. It starts off with an old man visiting a woman to read her a story. We don't know who they are at first, and once he starts reading, we now see the story that he narrates. The story is about a man named Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) who is visiting the carnival with his friends. Soon he sees Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) and from that minute knows that she is the woman for him. Soon they start seeing each other and fall in love. But Allie's parents don't approve of the relationship because Noah is a poor man working in the lumber yard for a living, while Allie is a rich socialite, who is staying with her parents only during the summer, after which she will be off to the woman's college. What follows is a twist in the tale, where Noah and Allie go their separate ways, bind their relationship with others, and somehow face themselves together many years later. Do they still feel the same about one another after all these years? Will they be together again? <br /> <br />The main reasons I liked this movie were: <br /> <br />1) The way in which this movie is told: Watching a story a within another story is a great idea for this movie. Director Nick Cassavetes did a wonderful job in directing this movie, by selecting breathtaking locations to shoot this movie in. <br />2) Chemistry between the characters: This movie wouldn't have kept anyone's interest if the main characters have no on screen chemistry. However, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams acted spectacularly, where you actually root for them to be together throughout. Gena Rowlands and James Garner also did a nice job with their roles. <br />3) The Music: Aaron Zigman produced a lovely soundtrack that went perfectly with this movie.  <br /> <br /> So, if you liked movies such as `A Walk to Remember' or `Message in a Bottle' (which are some other movie adaptation of Sparks' novels), then you will enjoy \\"The Notebook\\".
0441003257|5.0|In \\"Good Omens,\\" the ultimate dark force (the Antichrist and the ensuing Apocalypse) is repeated by authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman as (mostly) a slapstick farce.  The Satanic nun Sister Mary Loquacious, in a tried-and-true piece of Gilbert-&-Sullivan-like schtick, mixes up the Anti-christ, born to an American diplomat in England, and a regular British kid, born to a mild family of sweater-vested, pipe-smoking regular Brits.      The four horseman of the Apocalypse (riding motorcycles, so literally Hell's Angels) must ride off to correct matters.  An angel named Aziraphale and a demon named Crowley find they must join forces to find the real Antichrist first.     Who'd'a thought that farce and eschatology would blend so well together?  Although the whole is seamless, Pratchett-ologists and Gaimanites will relish speculating on which parts of the books were penned by which co-author.  Gaiman's vision, as with other of his books such as \\"Neverwhere,\\" seems more genuinely apolyptic and cynical, as when placing the \\"horseman\\" Famine in the New York fashion industry.      Pratchett, it seems to me, is in contrast fundamentally optimistic.  The people he writes about are basically good; it's just that their institutions are silly. So, I claim on behalf of Pratchett the passage where four human bikers decide to follow the Four Horseman: one of them can't make up his mind about what name he should ride under, and vacillates between being called \\"Embarassing Personal Problems,\\" \\"Things Not Working Properly Even After You've Given Them a Really Good Thumping,\\" and \\"No-Alcohol Lager\\" (since Death, War, Famine, and Pollution were already taken). A religious zealot called \\"Thou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer\\" also seems to belong to Pterry.    By all accounts, both authors found this combination of styles hard work.  They don't seem eager to repeat it, regardless of the runaway success of \\"Good Omens\\" itself.  So read this one twice or more for good measure; I don'tthink you'll see its like again.

She turned his marriage proposal down because she did not see the value in his creativity and vision.  We get a real sense of what Gwen is feeling the first time she sees the house. Imagine this: You are walking thru a brand new house that was custom designed by someone you know.  No one has ever lived in it, and the person it was offered to has turned it down. Gwen thought the house was so beautiful that she sat out side of the house and stared at it in amazement! Although she initially didn't want Newton around because of her con, we know that she could see the value of the man.  This is the focus of the story: not the house but the story of a woman recognizing the quailites of Newton. <br /> <br />One of my favorite movies!
B00006JJ2Y|4.0|If you're reading this review, you've already taken a ganders at the track listing.  You probably think \\"wow, what a great set!  My favorite VU and Lou Reed songs performed live!\\"  This is all well and good, unless you plan on actually listening to the tracks.  if you wanna do that, check out one of Lou's other 3,000 live albums instead.  If you love Lou and want to take a double shot of Lou's attitude, have a few laughs, and hear him talk about whatever was on his mind, then you may enjoy this.  I do.  This is what the Velvet Underground would've sounded like if it was fronted by Larry David; at times it sounds like a Charles Bukowski performance, or a lecture delivered by Hunter Thompson at a University.  Both these guys drew crowds who sometimes cared less about their writing and more about being around their infamous personalities and to hear their drunken ramblings.  This album is like that; the music often takes a backseat to Lou's personality, and drunken ramblings.  That being said, the music is still top notch, and if you're still interested in this live document after reading all the reviews, then by all means get it.  Just know what you're getting yourself into.
B000005HO0|4.0|When they weren't busy burning churches or killing each other these crazy kids from Norway found time to be a band.  Not just any band, this is Mayhem, pioneers of black metal.  Influenced by Venom, Bathory, Slayer, and the like, Mayhem set out to be harder and scarier than any band that came before.  This CD, Live at Leipzig, serves as a snapshot of what they were at the time.  It is aggressive and raw.  It is also supposedly one of the only recordings that has Dead, Euronymous, and Count Grisnackh (Varg Vikerness) all playing on it.  <br /> <br />Live at Leipzig is to black metal what the Stooges' Raw Power is to punk.  It captures the unfiltered essence of the genre.  The musicianship is loose.  The guitars are in the red and the vocals are high wails and rough snarls.  With songs like \\"Chainsaw Gutsf***\\", there is no easy listening here.  In this live format the track \\"Pure F***ing Armageddon\\" lives up to it's name.  <br /> <br />Is Live at Leipzig a good CD?  Well... I can't dance to it.  It scares the hell out of my girlfriend and my pets.   Musically, lyrically, and in overall production it is creepy and appalling.  However, black metal is supposed to be creepy and appalling.  Black metal taps into anger, aggression, and violent fantasy.  Here Mayhem succeed.  They did exactly what they set out to do, they are harder and scarier than all of their influences. It must be difficult having a career where you constantly submerge yourself in anger and violence because, unfortunately,  this line-up of Mayhem didn't survive very long past this recording.   The handful of early Mayhem recordings laid the groundwork for all subsequent black metal bands.  If you are interested in the genre and can stomach the violence and occult imagery than I  recommend Live at Leipzig.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" is my all-time favorite album.  It's the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" for this generation.  There are many outstanding tracks on this album: \\"Paranoid Android\\", \\"Karma Police\\", \\"No Surprises\\", and \\"Let Down\\" just scratches the surface.  Radiohead is truly a groundbreaking, original band.  This album is absolutely a must-have.
038073186X|4.0|I don't want to give away anthing about how this book plays out. But I do want to add my accolades to the many others already here. Lehane is a brilliant writer, and this is a gripping thriller. It's also a risky endevour. It's not a traditional crime novel, and it certainly doesn't hinge on the regular sort of bad guy, good guy stuff. As I got near the end of this and watched the main character struggle for truth I was totally with him. I was struggling too. That's the thing - Lehane manages to create his main character so well that you end up just as conflicted and troubled as he is. But then when it's all revealed it all makes sense and you can see the threads that Lehane wove in all the way through, right back to the first scenes. This book is that good, that carefully written.<br /><br />It would be a lot easier to write this review if I could say more about the plot revelations toward the end. I can't though. But do believe me, this book is worth your time.
0316172324|2.0|I made the snap decision thinking this book would be good. I was wrong. He spends the entire book trying to explain snap decisions are right the majority of the time. I made a snap decision to buy this book because it looked interesting. I was wrong. I give him credit though because he tried to tackle a very \\"gray area\\" topic. Snap decisions are often times correct, and I hoped I would hear some logical reasoning to this. I  had high hopes after hearing his first test, the Iowa Gambler test. He though, always fell short by never answering WHY anything was the way it was. Since he stated he had 3 objectives in the beginning of the book, and failed to meet any of them, I had to give him 2 stars.    The entire book had the following theme:     1) Tell a story that dealt with somebody making a snap decision instead of an informed one (always was a story that only would take place on the rarist of circumstances).   2) Inform the user this thought process has a psychological name.   3) Re-iterate story inserting psychological name all over the place.   4) move onto a similar story or new chapter  5) repeat
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Very good collection of Michael's songs, but there are three that could have been added to make it the perfect Greatest Hits. Those are Say Say Say with Paul McCartney, State of Shock with the Jacksons, and Scream with Janet.  I don't understand why Say Say Say isn't on any of his greatest hits collections when it was a number one song for 6 weeks.  Either way, this is something a true fan should have.
B000002IQW|5.0|Someone once described Skid Row's sound as \\"hungry.\\"  There's not a better word in the English language for their sophomore album.  Harder and possessing more bite than other hair metal albums (including Skid Row's first album), Slave To The Grind combines a razor sharp edge that echoes of the best of Guns N' Roses with the Row's own stellar sense of melody.  The entire album flat out rocks, and rocks hard, but it's the delicate touches than make it a superior effort to their first outing.  The desperation and overwhelming sadness in lead singer's Sebastian Bach's voice in In A Darkened Room, the instrumental bridge in Psycho Love which just seems to stop time before exploding back outwards, the sheer ferocity of Get The F!ck Out, all combine to create an album that's not easily forgotten.  I'll admit it took me a bit of time to warm up to Slave To The Ground, as I guess I came in expecting lighter hair metal like Steelheart and Def Leppard.  But once I listened to it through, I realized just how damn good a job Skid Row did with this CD.  The drum build-ups, the pitch perfect guitar solos, and Bach's vocals which are belted out with such aggression that it's a miracle the man remembered to breathe, all of this is what makes Slave To The Grind worth a serious listen.  It's not as immediately accessible as Def Leppard or Motley Crue, but I have the feeling that for that very reason, Skid Row's second album is infinitely more durable.
B0007P3582|2.0|Im sorry 50 cent fans but dis album was a waste of plastic. U either like dis lp cuz you are in tha burbs and u are a shady/g-unit fanatic or u jus came up out of rehab. Now my real hip hop fans out there knows 50 lyrics and flow is very weak and overated but otha wise its going to sale regardless of wat tha album sounds like he couldnt done it a country and heavy metal album and tha burbs and clones ppl out there would of said still dis album rocks! Ya boy 50 is over rated and u get on Ja for doing love songs or pop joints or singing and u turn around and mimic and do tha same thang. \\"Candy Shop\\" for one example and then \\"Disco Inferno\\" to \\"Get In My Car\\" and im not done to \\"So Amazing\\". It was a very weak follow up album to \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" whick was a hard lp. But dis cd was embarssing fam for real. Like he had a couple tight tracks like \\"Ski Mask Way\\" and \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" was sum tight tracks as well as for \\"Postion Of Power\\" was hot. Overall fam dis cd was garbage like \\"Piggy Bank\\" man all the hype i heard around dat 1 track from G-Unit and sum writters I thought dat was going to be tha coldest diss track in hip hop history and like I expected it was horrible tha beat was hot but tha diss is garbage. Honestly he dont want it with D-Block,Nas,Shyne or Crack. Jada killed him in \\"Checkmate\\" and \\"Problem Child\\" and Crack already got him with \\"F*ck 50\\". Five O aint a lyrical giant like Nas honestly he dont want it wit Nas already a Hip Hop King. Shyne is a real gangsta and will kill five o personaly. Every track is tha same talking bout his gun every track like \\"Guns Come Out\\" and \\"Gatman and Robin\\". His d*ck ryder fan Tony Yayo on \\"Toy Soilder\\" why do u want to be sum1 toy soilder? This album is one sided I suggest leave it where it is i heard tha lp like five times tha whole entire cd from tha begining to tha end and its garbage. GGGGGGGGG-Unot!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. The Game already got u with dat 300 bars why havent u popped off yet hommmie? Lol <br /> <br />Tha Only Good Songs <br />Ski Mask Way <br />Baltimore Love Thang <br />Position Of Power <br />In My Hood <br />And Get In My Car is aight
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|Excellent  music. All tunes are well represented in this greatest hits CD. With the addition of Carmina, one can see how diverse and talented the group is.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|When I listen to this record, i dont hear songs, i hear music, in a continous flow dancing around and flying in ways music has never done.  It is simply amazing how well this cd was put together.  Although it has the equal amazingness as De-Loused(first Album)except there is a feeling of desertion and Issolation.  It is   simply an amazing album and you have hear it to fully understand how amazing it is
B0009W5JS2|4.0|The first xXx with Vin diesel was better than this one, but this was was ok. I'd give this movie 4 and a half stars and the first 5 stars. I would buy this DVD, but If you don't have the first one with Vin Diesel get that one first, The Uncensored Unrated Director's Cut one. Ice Cube was ok in this classic or near classic movie, but Vin the man Diesel was better. <br />I hope they make another xXx movie, but none of them will be as good as Vin Diesel's. g2g and buy Vin Diesel's first, but you should already have it on DVD cause it's 3 yrs old, so buy Ice Cubes xXx - State of the Union.
B000089CJI|3.0|It has a lot going for it--its catchy, is in a pretty unusual emotional environment sounding naive and melancholy at the same time, which is refreshing.  That said, this certainly isn't the most original thing in the world, either... having listened to lots of Aphex Twin and IDM type stuff this just seems kinda like trickle-down mash-up which frankly, isn't as good, either.  The orchestration is almost always cluttered with too much of the little soft fast beats.  There are exceptions here, mostly \\"Such Great Heights\\" which is probably the most refined and interesting melodically as well and has more staying power than most of the rest of the songs. <br />Also, being the nerd that I am, I couldn't help but laugh when a little clip from Mahler's 6th symphony made its way into \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\".  It has its purpose in the song, so I'm not really complaining, but it did make me think about how much better an orchestrator Mahler was...
B00005JM1F|5.0|This movie is so F*ckin funny you will S*it your F*ckin pants  <br />off. Don't watch this movie on a full stomach or you will <br />s*it.Buy this F*ckin DVD today. <br />g2g and buy this F*ckin DVD
0385512058|4.0|When I first walked by this book in the bookstore I snickered at the title. Later that day, while I was eating lunch alone, I decided to research more on Amazon. I bought it, read it, and was pleasantly surprised. Although the book is quit thin in parts (developing a Network Action Plan is more of a scheme than a plan), it had many helpful insights. <br /> <br />The author takes pains to point out that great networkers are only indirectly interested in expanding their own power or influence. What they primarily seek is contributing to the success of others, which in turn, should create a series of \\"contacts,\\" which range from business associates to genuine friends. It is not nearly as calculating as I feared, and the author is not as unctous and disingenous as I suspected. He doesn't lack for confidence, but he admits to his faults and offers some telling examples of what not do. Overall, a solid book that will help some loners.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|A classic movie in the makin. Buy this DVD you Flippen Idiot Gosh. Don't listen to all those haters out there who hated this classic movie, they just don't want to vote 4 Pedro. <br />g2g and buy this Flippen DVD or F*ck you hater.
B0009XNUK0|3.0|Don't get me wrong. Michael Jackson is a great artist. I'm also a huge fan of his music but this just did not do it for me.  This is the same stuff we've been seeing. Look at Number Ones, and the Box Set. It seems like Michael just keeps releasing old stuff. I only rated it 3 stars because lack of new stuff. <br /> <br />I'm not saying that he should go out and record all new music (it would be nice) but I wish he would release old stuff that he has stored away songs like  \\"Monkey Business, and Cheater,\\" or Sunset Driver.\\" If he could release stuff he recorded a while ago that would sell really well. I do hope he releases those old goodies.
B0009K7RTI|5.0|What's the one truly ironic thing about \\"professional\\" film critics? <br />... Almost none of them have ever been an actor,a director, a cinematographer, or screen writer. Doesn't it strike anyone as peculiar, then, that these men and women consider themselves to be the world's foremost authorities in film-making and dramatic liscense? To put it simply, those who can, do... Those who can't, critique. Perhaps they're just jealous. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite looks at the duller, more common world of teen-aged life. Where \\"Sixteen Candles\\" took all of the dramatic moments of high school-itis and crammed it into one film, \\"Napoleon\\" chose to focus on the more mundane, nauseating moments of the coming-of-age years. The main character was an amalgam of those closeted mal-contents of whom we were all critical in high school. And while I agree that there wasn't really a plot throughout the film, neither was there ever any point to what REALLY happened in high school. In that sense, Napolean Dynamite is more realistic than any other film about adolescence that we've been fed over the last 25 years. <br /> <br />I will admit that when I watched it the first time, I was fairly uncomfortable because I just didn't get it. It seemed gawdy, pointless, and a bit disquieting. Almost Immediately upon my second viewing, however, everything began to make sense. The fact is, there was really nothing to \\"get.\\" It was there for pure enjoyment and gave it's audience the opportunity to look back and remember a time when absolutely NOTHING made sense.  <br /> <br />In the end, watching Napoleon \\"cut a rug\\" on stage, I was also filled with a powerful message:  that anyone, even the most unlikely people, can have their day in the sun.  <br /> <br />As a side-note, let me remind those meandering critics that there isn't one person I've spoken to(educated or otherwise) who didn't thoroughly enjoy this film. Perhaps you all need to forget about selling your column and buy back your soul. Maybe then you'll be more in tune with your readers. Because, right now, they all think you suck. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am so glad this finally came out on DVD. So what? Lucas changed a couple of things...big whoop, the movies are still excellent. However, for all you idiots still stuck on Full Screen DVD's, keep away from this one, it has the worst transfer ever you lose at least 50% of the picture. All I ever had was the full screen VHS, now I know what I was missing!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Didn't see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an X-box you can play the Constantine video game.
0920668372|5.0|This book was first read to me when I was 6, after my sister had died. I hadn't thought about it again until recently, now almost 21, and, since I work at a library, decided to hunt it down. I remember liking it back then, but when coming back to read it now, I know I enjoyed it much more. Yeah, the mother can come off as a stalker as she climbs into her grown man's bedroom, and that part made me laugh, but the story is a good one and by the end I was tearing up. I disagree with the person who said it wasn't appropriate for children, but of course I'm a bit biased, having read it at a young age myself, but also perhaps having had to deal with death at that age. I definately think I got more out of it now, but it's a story that can be read numerous times and which I think is suitable for all ages.
0375703764|5.0|I have never and will never be the same since I read this book!  Read thousands of books in my life.  THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|i seen the play on broadway 4 times, and when the movie opened i was there the first night i loved it , so when the disc came out i bought it. and a big thanks to amazon for shipping so quickly thanks again
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is the best movie ever in the entire world.  Whether you're a phan or not, I'd bet money that you'll love this film version of the perfect musical.   <br />If you're skeptical because the Phantom isn't played by the wonderful Michael Crawford, sorry to be so harsh, but GET OVER IT!  You can't call yourself a phan if you're letting that casting decision keep you from watching the movie. <br />Gerry Butler does a phantastic job of playing the Phantom.  He may not have a perfect voice, as Michael Crawford does, but it's easy to fall in love with his performance.   <br />Emmy Rossum fills the part of Christine perfectly.  She has an amazing voice. <br />Patrick Wilson as Raoul also has a beautiful voice and is a great actor.  (But who in the world likes Raoul anyway?) <br />The movie is unbelieveably beautiful visually, and with a 110 piece orcheastra the music is to die for.  (Which is what most viewers fall for anyway.) <br />I recommend the Special Edition DVD to everyone thinking of buying the movie.  The \\"Behind the Mask\\" special feature is tearjerking for a true phan of the musical, and very informative.  The additional scene is an additional scene, not deleted from the movie, and features another great performance from Gerry Butler.  The three part \\"Making of the Phantom of the Opera\\" is really great.  It answered a lot of questions I had about decisions made by director Joel Schumacher and genius producer Andrew Lloyd Webber.  My guess is that it'll answer yours too. <br />And finally, the secret special feature is hillarious.  It's a sing-a-long to the title song by the cast and crew of the film.  (Hint: It's located at the bottom of the menus of the second disc!) <br />The Phantom of the Opera is the best movie ever in the entire world, there will never be a better one made.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" is one of those albums.  One of those life-changing records that the first time you hear it (and I mean REALLY hear it-- it took me over ten years to really hear it), you stop what you're doing, no matter what, and you just listen.  And somehow, when its done, you start it over again and it feels like everything's changed. <br /> <br />Buckley, who died at a young age after recording only one studio album (this one), has left a legacy with us.  Showing signs of his pedigree in downtown New York, his music has that sort of unnamed quality you can't quite pin down.  Simple folk songs or delicate blues somehow become quite a bit more.  It could be Buckley's voice, a high tenor that feels a bit like a non-tempered instrument, is certainly evocative and filled with emotion.  It could be the subtlety of the arrangements.  It could be something else entirely. <br /> <br />The point is, its there, and the music really is transcendent.  To single out any particular track is a bit unfair, its pretty much all unbelievably good, from blues-based rock (\\"Mojo Pin\\", \\"Eternal Life\\") to ballads (\\"Hallelujah\\", \\"Lilac Wine\\", \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\") and some material that just defies even such broad categories (\\"Last Goodbye\\", \\"So Real\\").  But really, star to finish, a superb record. <br /> <br />My recommendation is to get this, or get the \\"Legacy Edition\\" reissue thats just overflowing with extra material, both audio and video.  But even without, this is something everyone should hear.  Give it time, it took nearly a decade for me to get this one (a friend of mine played it for me when it first came out and I didn't care for it, it wasn't until recently that it made sense).  It is one of the masterpieces of the '90s.
0446608955|2.0|I did not care for this book -  it wasn't the worst book I have ever read, but it didn't even come close to being \\"good\\".  I cannot believe it got so many 5 star ratings.  It was so predictable, I basically knew how it was going to end by the 4th chapter.  I immediately caught onto the little \\"hints\\" the author was dropping that Jamie was not well.   <br />I felt like I was reading a novel written by a 16 year old.  By the end of the book I was so sick of Landon saying \\"if you know what I mean\\" that I could scream!  This story was supposed to be happening through the eyes of a 50 something year old man - how many older men do you know that says \\"if you know what I mean\\" after every other statement.  Give me a break.  It was torture to read that over and over....
B0009MDPYM|2.0|<br />\\"Constantine,\\" had cheesy potential, but the cheese is all found in yet another misleading trailer.  The sheer laziness of director Francis Lawrence is amazing.  The editing of the film makes the story nearly incoherent.  And the script?   At one point Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) tells John Constantine (Reeves) that she fears demons have killed her (twin) sister.  Less than five minutes later she tells Constantine that she doesn't believe in the Devil!  Whoa! Doesn't someone, while filming or editing, red flag such inconsistencies?     <br /> <br />As far as the twin sister goes, that's one red herring among many - like the Spear of Destiny, insane angels, brainless \\"soldier\\" demons (what's the difference?), and voodoo magicians.   Much is made here of Weisz's (the \\"Mummy\\" lady) performance.  I don't know why.  She simply doesn't have the lines to deliver her from the mess she's in.  Reeves?  \\"Constantine\\" is just further evidence that he's an earlier generation's Ben Affleck.  He can't act.  And with \\"Constantine,\\" and its loads of special effects, he can't be insulated (this time) from that fact.  Interestingly there are two characters that do make an impression.  Tilda Swinton as gender bent angel Gabriel, who has you wondering if Gwyneth Paltrow and David Bowie have morphed into one person, and Peter Stormare's Satan.  Stormare's performance is a particular hoot.  He looks like he wandered in from the set of \\"Caberet,\\" and he clearly elevates things at a moment when I seemed past caring.  For that alone I'll give \\"Constantine\\" two stars.  The rest can go to Hell.  <br />
B000002WAD|5.0|i dont have a long review to write cus the others have put it beautifuly already,i agree with others that ricks deep voice never got the credit it fully deserved..this album is really relaxing to listen to at home or whenever...i love the song \\"it would take a strong man\\"he really uses his voice in that one..whenever you need somebody is a fave of mine also as well as never going to give you up!!i would recommend anyone to have this one added to your library if you dont already have it
B00097A5HW|5.0|I loved this cd. The music is different from her laundry service cd, but the lyrics are amazing. It tells alot about where Shakira is right now in her life.
1573226521|5.0|My boyfriend (and former backpacker through Thailand) kept bugging me to read this book but I was initially put off because i;m really not a fan of adventure novels. Once I finally picked it up I couldn't put it down. It's one of the best novels i've ever read. <br /> <br />The amount of foreshadowing is intoxicating and it's not simply a tale of adventure. It's about culture, deceit, social structure. For a first novel it is extremely impressive.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The cast recording of Wicked is truly a great broadway soundtrack that I'm really happy I ended up buying. It is one of the better soundtracks I have listened to -- and I have been listening to that and the RENT soundtrack constantly within the past couple days. <br /> <br />Let's so through the tracks first. <br />\\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" -- this has one of the best overture/intros I have ever heard. It's so fun and all of Schwartz's songs seem to mesh together wonderfully in this opening medley. I love whenever an entire crowd of singers get together in this CD, becuase the harmonies are always interesting and they mesh together really well. Kristen shows her first talent: great, nearly operatic talent as a wonderful soprano. Plus, this song has a wonderful middle section featuring Elphaba's mother, father, midwife, and the \\"mysterious lover\\". Wonderful section. Overall -- a great great song.  <br /> <br />\\"Dear Old Shiz\\" -- Great, if only for the harmoies. It's interesting enough, and though it doesn't actually give us much of anything, the harmonies are good and it's short enough not to want to skip. <br /> <br />\\"The Wizard and I\\" -- I love this song. It's our first chance to hear Menzel shine, as she does several times throughout this CD. It's got a really catchy melody, interesting lyrics, and gives us our first glimpse at the little \\"unlimited\\" diddy that is featured wonderfully throughout several songs of the CD. <br /> <br />\\"What Is This Feeling?\\" -- This is one of my favorite songs on the soundtrack. Again, the chorus is excellent, and Chenoworth and Menzel blend EXCELLENTLY together. It's a fun song that is very re-listenable. I find myself repeating this song the most. <br /> <br />\\"Something Bad\\" -- the tune is interseting enough, and again, the trouble with Broadway soundtracks is that not every song is going to be a show stopper, so some songs seem to be forgotten because they aren't necessarily amazing, but there is nothing that makes this song anything \\"bad\\", or something bad. <br /> <br />\\"Dancing Through Life\\" -- possibly the only song that gets a bit tedious. Fiyero has a beautiful voice and I love listening to parts of this song, but overall, it's one that I don't listen to that much. The melody isn't anything special, but it's not too bad. Plus, in the show, it adds for some good advancements, so I don't mind it. <br /> <br />\\"Popular\\" -- Chenoworth shows us her second major talent: being hilarious, in both her comedic voice and in her mannerisms. This is a great song, very catch, and Chenoworth shows that she will give Menzel a run for her money, as far as talent goes (both women are infinately talented.) <br /> <br />\\"I'm Not That Girl\\" -- a mellow moment in that soundtrack. We get to see how controlled Menzel's voice can be, rather than simply being a powerhouse. It's sweet enough.  <br /> <br />\\"One Short Day\\" -- again, I am impressed with the choir. And the music. Those are the best parts of this song. <br /> <br />\\"A Sentimental Man\\" -- I fear that Joel Grey's talents were not put to the best use in Wicked. His songs rarely seem to lift off their feet, and besides a rather silly/fun melody, neither of his featured songs offer too much. If anything, they are a nice sequey into something usually much darker in the show. <br /> <br />\\"Defying Gravity\\" -- the first song I heard, and the song that made me go \\"I NEED TO BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK!\\" Wow, if I ever DIDN'T have a reason to think Menzel was amazing, all I needed to listen to this song. One of the best on the CD. The ending -- it sends chills up and down my spine and all over my body everytime I listen to it. <br /> <br />\\"Thank Goodness\\" -- I love the chorus again, and Chenoworth impresses, though it's a shame that she was mostly given the cutesy songs to sing, though I suppose that goes with G(a)linda's character.  <br /> <br />\\"Wonderful\\" -- RE: what I said about \\"Sentimental Man.\\" This song has a slightly more catchy medley. <br /> <br />\\"I'mNot That Girl (Reprise)\\" -- not much to say about this less-than-a-minute song, except Chenoworth sounds good again. <br /> <br />\\"As Long As Your Mind\\" -- Becuase of the talents of Menzel and Butz this song is a lot better than it probobly would be sung by two others. It seems a bit misplaced, but I love how this love song has a very dark undertow. <br /> <br />\\"No Good Deed\\" -- Undoubtably the best song on the soundtrack to me. It's got a great, dark theme to it, with Menzel perhaps being her most amazing (if there is ever a time that she is LESS than amazing).  <br /> <br />\\"March of the Witch Hunters\\" -- a fun and dark song, and it's good to hear from The Tin Man! <br /> <br />\\"For Good\\" -- What a beautiful way to pretty much cap off the entire show. It's such a sentimental and really touching song. I loved it. Both of them sound great. <br /> <br />\\"Finale B\\" -- a great way to cap it off. Loved hearing some of those famliar medleys again. I loved this. <br /> <br />Perhaps the ONLY compplaint I have with the soundtrack is that some of the songs are VERY confusing to understand what is going on unless you have seen the show. Songs like \\"Defying Gravity,\\" \\"Thank Goodness,\\" \\"No Good Deed,\\" and \\"For Good\\" are much clearer when seeing it in the show. <br /> <br />PS -- you have to see this show. <br /> <br />This is a great score, but the talent that surrounds this soundtrack is almost too good for words!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I really have a hard spot for heavy driving music.  For the most part the metal genre and other hard rock acts fill that cavity nicely (yes it can be incredibly varied ladies and gents.).  But I digress. <br /> <br />I am into a lot of tunes, and I am also a big fan of Radiohead.  So  I was quite surprised to hear such similarity between the vocalist Matthew Bellamy and Tom Yorke.  Then I briefly heard Muse open in the distance on a second stage for The Cure.  I was like hey??  Did Tom Yorke hijack the stage and start crashing his guitar.  But Muse fell on the backburner, then I caught some snipits of them playing in France for Live 8.  2 words. <br /> <br />HOLLY!! SH*@#$%@#! <br /> <br />As a result of watching those 3 guys in action I got this album and it is a great display of shattering power.  For only 3 guys, they make a firestorm of noise!!  Bassist Chris Wolstenholme also ressurects one of the most hardly heard great things, and that is playing fantastic sounding great distorted bass lines.   <br /> <br />Then you have Mat creating some infectious riffs on guitar, and Dominic backing up in Skins very nicely.  This is like a soaring alternative album but with a metal/rock edge done to polished perfection with a couple of melodic mellower songs filled in for good measure.  As much as Bellamy does sound like the vocalist from Radiohead, this is a band that sounds like no other!!  These guys are one great sounding original band. <br /> <br />This album and band is a great find!!
0975991477|5.0|Definition: naysay - To oppose, deny, or take a pessimistic or negative view of: They will naysay any policy that raises taxes.    I have read several reviews of this book, here on Amazon, that were uncomplimentary, to say the least. The particular people writing these reviews did not state their qualifications in the fields of histology or microbiology, so I can only imagine that their invectives must come from a less-than-learned source.    The effect that their reviews had on me, was to convey the idea that they are somewhat bigoted, arrogant and seem to want to push the idea that the individual is powerless to change himself, unless given a child-proof script of instructions. If they had set out to deliberately make themselves look foolish, they could not have done a better job.    I have this book, and am finding it a delight to read. It is not a stuffy, academic book, but is eminently approachable, and has an excellent bibliography for those people who want to pursue independent research. The author, Dr. Lipton, is obviously very familiar with his chosen field, and has the courage to have an opinion about what he has learnt from \\"the establishment\\".    All science advances to the degree that it permits creative thought and healthy criticism of its dogma. The endless parroting of dogma by the \\"slightly informed\\" is, of course, a symptom of a lack of true understanding.    If this book does nothing else but raise the awareness of the general public that the medical establishment maybe does not have   a monopoly, or even a full and complete understanding of the workings of the human body, it has achieved a major goal. And if it also successfully teaches that the individual MAY just be able to do something about his own condition, by achieving an understanding of cellular mechanics and that this may be influenced by his own mind, then it has more than proved its worth.    I, personally, would be skeptical of a book that offered a sure-thing recipe for successfullycombatting all ailments. Claiming to possess such detailed knowledge without a thorough analysis of the particular individual's situation and his complex environs would be suspicious to say the least. That would be snake oil at its best.    Western society's idea of medicine and the overall treatment of a malfunctioning human body, has become so formalized and super-specialized that it is now almost an heretical act for an individual to refuse what is offered as \\"standard treatment\\". It is your body, you DO have a choice in what is done to it. If you don't voice your opinions and objections, you may simply end up losing what power you might have already possessed to cure yourself through the natural process of homeostasis.    There is NO substitute for understanding. It IS the universal solvent. The more you understand about your body and its workings, the better prepared you are to keep it working properly .    \\"The Biology Of Belief\\" is a definite milestone in the slow process of evolving Western medicine into something that truly and accurately represents the intent of the Hippocratic Oath [...]

B0000508UN|3.0|grant green has a stellar discography, so it's rare when one of his releases misses a beat. alive! just doesn't have the typical quality of most of green's other releases though, and while it's not bad, this isn't one of green's sessions that needs to be searched out. recorded live in washington d.c. in late summer of 1970, green and his sextet focus on mostly modern to the day pop music covers. on many of the tracks, the group seems to have a hard time getting adjusted to each other. the music is sloppy. once they get it together though, and they always eventually do, the tunes catch a groove and you'll momentarily be reminded of how good green and his support could be. even still, the tunes are too long and you'll find yourself listening to the same riff over and over, in both the choruses and solos. what's more, the recording sound isn't up to snuff. at certain times, higher notes break away distorted and the guitar drowns out all of the other instruments, even when green is just backing up his musicians.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Too much \\"docu\\" and not enough \\"drama\\", movie rolls along at beakneck speed, way too fast, but, the story is real, spent a little time in Texas when the \\"pass or play\\" rule went into effect, war was ready to erupt in the lone star state over that!, very heated! high school football is a religion in Texas, just like in Indiana, high school basketball \\"USE\\" to be KING until the IHSSA put the class system in to place an KILLED interest in it! R.I.P. A statement came over a car radio, after a game was lost early in the movie, \\"I'll tell you what's wrong with the Panthers, there's too much learin' in school\\", tell you anything? Billy Bob Thornton just keeps getting better and better, he is an amazing actor, but Tim McGraw just floored me, he was terrific, he blew me away, great! The football action doesn't get any better than this movie, the young men playing the lead parts of the Permian players were very good, I still like, \\"Remember The Titans\\" best.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|The first ever single-disc Neil Young retrospective, and the first compilation of any kind since the 70s, \\"Greatest Hits\\" brings together 16 songs recorded between 1969 and 1991. <br />Many longtime fans will hate it because their favorite song is missing, but this disc brings together most of Young's best-known songs, making \\"Greatest Hits\\" a near-perfect introduction for the uninitiated.  <br /> <br />And it is hard not to respect a compilation which has \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\", \\"Heart Of Gold\\", \\"Harvest Moon\\", \\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\", and \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\". <br />Sure, some of my favorites are missing as well...songs like the galvanizing slow rock of \\"Powderfinger\\" and the lesser-known but equally memorable \\"Roll Another Number\\". But this is meant as an introduction, or a way for the casual fan to get \\"Rockin' In The Free World\\" and \\"Needle\\", it's not \\"The Complete Neil Young\\", or even \\"The Essential Neil Young\\". And if you look at it as \\"just\\" a single-disc greatest hits-compilation, well, it's pretty darn good. You get Neil Young the acoustic folk singer, Neil Young the rocker, and Neil Young the second-only-to-Bob-Dylan-source of inspiration to numerous other musicians.  <br /> <br />Once you're hooked, get the live albums \\"Weld\\", \\"Unplugged\\" and \\"Live Rust\\", and the studio albums \\"Tonight's The Night\\" and \\"After The Gold Rush\\". <br />For starters.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|This was the best season of TOS.  It added a lot of characterization to the crew, particurlarly Spock. <br /> <br />Stardate 3372.7 \\"Amok Time\\" Introduces TRek fans to the Vulcan mating ritual, and one of the best Vulcan episodes of the whole franchise. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3468.1 \\"Who Mourns for Adonis?\\" Theory of Greek gods being aliens from other planets.  Kinda dull. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3451.9 \\"The Changeling\\" Evil robot tries to exterminate all imperfect beings.  Very interesting theory, and very cool conclusion. 3 stars. <br /> <br />Stardate Unknown \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" EXCELLENT EPISODE! Crew runs into parallel universe where everything is opposite.  Started a long run of episodes on DS9. 5 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3715.3 \\"The Apple\\" Crew finds society controlled by computer.  Slightly better than the last season's attempt at this theme. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4202.9 \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" Indestructible machine destroys lots of planets for fuel.  Good tension between Kirk, Spock, McCoy and visiting Commodore Decker. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3018.2 \\"Catspaw\\" Possibly the Halloween episode? In any case, very stupid.  The three witches have laughing hysterically every time. 1 star <br /> <br />Stardate 4513.3 \\"I,Mudd\\" The return of Harry Mudd from Season 1.  A better episode than his last. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate Unknown \\"Metamorphosis\\" Crew meets Zefram Cochran, inventor of warp flight, on a deserted planet.  Fairly good episodes, but the Zefram Cochran is nothing like the Cochran seen in TNG's First Contact.  2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3842.3 \\"Journey to Babel\\" The first introduction to Spock's parents; Amabassador Sarek and his human wife, Amanda.  Excellent. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3497.2 \\"Friday's Child\\" Another episode with the Klingons and a tribal war. Could have been better. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3478.2 \\"The Deadly Years\\" Crew ages quickly.  Interesting idea, and another one of Kirk's former love interests. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3619.2 \\"Obsession\\" Kirk is obsessed with a deadlu cloud that killed his former commander. Could have been a lot better. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3614.9 \\"Wolf in the Fold\\" Scotty is the main suspect in a string of murders.  OK until the end, which I thought was stupid. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4523.3 \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\"  The most famous episode to come out of TOS, it spawned a counterpart in DS9, and tribbles have now become a cult item (I have a fluffy stuffed one that purrs when touched on my bookshelf). 5 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3211.7 \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\" Kirk and crew are captured by aliens who force them to fight. Interesting idea, just didn't work. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4598.0 \\"A Piece of the Action\\" Planet run by imitation of Chicago Mob.  Very funny to see Spock trying to be a gangster, and \\"fizzbinn\\" will go down in ST history. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4307.1 \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\" Giant amoeba threatens galaxy. Laughable idea, but good feeling. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4211.4 \\"A Private Little War\\" A thinly veiled version of the Vietnam War, except with Starfleet and the Klingon. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4768.3 \\"Return to Tomorrow\\" Aliens take over Kirk adn Spock's bodies.  All right. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2534.0 \\"Patterns of Force\\" Planet runs by Nazis.  Interesting theory, but Bread and Circuses was better. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4657.5 \\"By Any Other Name\\" Andromedan aliens take over the Enterprise.  Very good episode dealing with extra-galactic aliens.  4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate Unknown \\"The Omege Glory\\" Planet that is counterpart to Earth's Cold War.  Would have been better if they didn't throw the American flag in at the end. Aren't all countries supposed to be gone by now? 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4729.4 \\"The Ultimate Computer\\" CAptains look like they're about to be replaced.  Great look at a captain's place. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 4040.7 \\"Bread and Circuses\\" Planet run by Rome. Great gladiator fight. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate Unknown \\"Assignment: Earth\\" Enterprise interferes with mission to save 20th century Earth.  Weird episode, was supposed to start a spin-off series that never happened. 4 stars <br /> <br />Good season...wish it was reasonably priced so i could buy it. >.&lt;
B00000K31Q|5.0|Saving Private Ryan...no. Million dollar baby...No! This is a one of a kind movie that everyone can enjoy. I am serious. This is no chick flick. I have been watching this movie since I was about 9. Probably around 25 times in total (no exaggeration) and it just keeps getting better. There is the usual beautiful people, girly stuff but then there is substance too, that many others can enjoy. The dialog, song choice and casting are perfect! When someone asks me my favorite movie, I don't even hesitate. Buy your own copy of Ten Things I Hate About You TODAY!!
B0002I831S|4.0|I got this for Christmas last year and have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it.  After watching all the spin-off series it's always awesome to go back to go back to the beginning and see where it all began, which would be here.  All in all, a solid season with some memorable episodes but the second seaon was better. <br /> <br />Pilot: \\"The Cage\\" I only saw it once but it was obviously solid enough to start the show on a network.  Kinda weird because they hadn't figured everything out yet. i.e. Spock smiles o.O  Plus, it wasn't Captain Kirk, but his predecessor Captain Pike. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 1513.1 \\"The Man Trap\\" Not the best episdoe ever, but as it was the first one ever aired.  It actually gave Dr. McCoy a lot more development than almost every episode since. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 1533.6 \\"Charlie X\\" I never saw it, my dad made us skip because it was supposedly awful. N/A <br /> <br />Stardate 1312.4 \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" The second pilot for the show...slightly more normal than the first and a fairly good episode with an unusual idea. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 1704.2 \\"The Naked Time\\" Always one of my favorites.  A lot of character development, but all in all, fairly predictible. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 1672.1 \\"The Evil Within\\" Also and intersting idea, and although Kirk was the center of this episode, it was here where we first hear about Spock's mixed parentage, which would become so important throughout the rest of the series. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 1329.1 \\"Mudd's Women\\" One of the most fanous episodes of the whole series, it ontroduces us to the series only recurring character,  Harry Mudd.  fairly intersting but his second episode was better. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2712.4 \\"What are Little Girls Made Of?\\" Develops the character of Nurse Chapel, which is important but coudl have been better. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2713.5 \\"Miri\\" This was a good episode and demonstrates why Star Trek became famous.  Ithad an extremely interesting idea with 100-year-old children and shows the bond Kirk had with his crew. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2715.1 \\"Dagger of the Mind\\" Shows a lot about the way things were done in the 23rd century and, of course, Kirk's reputationa s a ladies' man. 3 stars. <br /> <br />Stardate 1512.2 \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\" Not one of my favorites, but the alien at the end is played by Ron Howard's brother. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3012.4 and 3013.1 \\"The Menagerie Parts I + II\\" Uses a lot of footage from the pilot, but also shows a great deal of the friendship between Kirk and Spock. A memorable epsiode (only Spock could find the only crime in the 23rd century that could give them death penalty) and the series' only 2-parter. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2817.6 \\" The Consience of the King\\" A lot fo Captain Kirk's history in here. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 1709.2 'Balance of Terror\\" The first episode that features the Romulans, and an excellent one.  Great battle scenes, and the Romulan commander is the same actor who went one to play Spock's father in the second season, and the only actor to play a Romulan, a Vulcan and a Klingon. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3025.3 \\"Shore Leave\\" An interesting look into the crew's characters. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2821.5 \\"the Galileo Seven\\" One of my favorites, becasue I'm a Spock fan.  A really great look into Spock's character, and the relationship between the starship captains and the Federation staff back on Earth. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2124.5 \\"The Squire of Gothos\\" Also one of my favorites. A really intersting theory and I always saw Trelane as the precursor to TNG's Q, who is my favorite recurring character of all time. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3045.6 \\"Arena\\" one of Star Trek's more interesting ideas, and the Gorn are a memorable species. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3113.2 \\"Tomorrow is Yesterday\\" The first time travel centered epsiode, and that continues to be a favorite themethroughout all the series.  They also dealt with the time travel paradox very well, and the little green men from Mars and Capt. Christopher's reaction to Spock was the best part of the episode. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 2947.3 \\"Court Martial\\" One of my favorites. I just love law episodes, and the crew really shone in this one. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3156.2 \\"The Return of the Archons\\"  An intersting idea, and shows how interplantery missions and first contacts are the most dangerous and delicate operations of the Enterprise. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3141.9 \\"Space Seed' One of the best episodes of the whole franchise.  Khan is one the best villians ever, and was brought back in the second movie, the best ST movie ever made.  This one is just amazing; there is no describing it. 5 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3192.1 \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\" One the most unusual ideas in ST, and a memorable episodes 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3417.3 \\"This Side of Paradise\\" One the most famous epsiodes, and an excellent look at Spock's suppressed emotions (yes. he does have emotions) 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3196.1 \\"The Devil in the Dark One of the most interesting ideas of the whole series...an alien that is based on silicon.  Also deals with the nature of good and evil.  4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3198.4 \\"Errand of Mercy\\" Fairly interesting, and it's always cool to see the Klingons, but they were better in the Trouble with Tribbles 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3087.6 \\"The Alternative Factor\\" Possibly the worst episode of the whole series...could have been an interesting idea but jst failed miserably. 1 star <br /> <br />Stardate 3134.0 \\"They City on the Edge of Forever\\" THE BEST EPISODE OF TOS and one of the best in ST history.  Just phenomonal. ST at it's best. 5 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 3287.2 \\"Operation: Annihilate1\\" A favorite, centered around bonds of friendship and family.  Acted very well, and is a fitting end to the 1st season. 4 stars <br /> <br />A good season and a great start to an even better universe. Note to Paramount: Ridiculously overpriced, stop taking advantage of ST fans!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0201433079|5.0|Is it just me or did this book quintuple in size between the first and second versions. This book is now an almost thousand page hardback tome. But all that extra bulk is not a bad thing in this case. Each sub-system is now covered in amazing detail. The illustrations are fantastic. And the book covers the bevy of Unix variants which makes it extremely valuable. Definitely a must have second edition for any programmer whose primary platform is Unix.
B000062XFG|4.0|The second season. An improvement over the mostly horrible first season (Troi changed her hairstyle which coincided with a miraculous personality change that made the 7th season Troi a completely different person from the first season, it was the only season with a different doctor, Dr. Pulaski, who was a little bit like a female Dr. McCoy and was a complete failure. <br /> <br />Stardate 42073.1 \\"The Child\\" Troi becomes pregnant because of an alien that wants to learn what it is like to have a corporeal existance. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42193.6 \\"Where Silence Has Lease\\" Huge alien being engulfs Enterprise and tries to kill off 1/3 of the crew in an attempt to learn how humans die.  Picard activates auto-destruct but stops with 2 seconds to spare as being releases them. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42286.3 \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" The introduction of Data's favorite Sherlock Holmes holoprogram.  Of course they get stuck in there, and one of the characters becomes self-awar and tries to take over the ship.  Starts a running theme with Data, and Professor Moriarty becomes a semi-recurring character. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42402.7 \\"The Outrageous Okana\\" A roguish freightor captain comes aboard the Enterprise and tries to teach Data about humor.  Another episode wher Wesley saves the day (ugh) but the ending line is good. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42477.2 \\"Loud as a Whisper\\" A deaf mediator comes aboard Enterprise. His only way to communicate with others is through a chorus of people who can tranlate his thoughts into words.  When they are killed, he must do the mission without them. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42437.5 \\"The Schizoid Man\\" Dying scientist transfer his conciousness into Data, causing some unusually emotional responses on his part, but everything turns out all right in the end ( this is Star Trek after all) 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42494.8 \\"Unnatural Selection\\" Dr. Pulaski ages quickly, calling mind TOS episode \\"The Deadly Years\\", which was better. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42506.5 \\"A Matter of Honor\\" Riker takes part in a transfer program and is first officer aboard a Klingon ship.  If only the secondary story weren't about Wesley, it would have been great. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42523.7 \\"The Measure of a Man\\" An annoying scientist, with the habit of calling Data \\"it\\" wants to take Data apart and PIacrd must defend his second officer in a battle to decide whether Data is a life-form or not. A great episode. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42568.8 \\"The Dauphin\\" Wesley falls for visiting girl who isn't all she appears to be.  Shape-shifters should never have been attempted before DS9. and Wesley should be thrown out of an airlock. 1 star <br /> <br />Stardate 42609.1 \\"Contagion\\" Enterprise's sister ship explodes mysteriously and Data's programming gets erased. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42625.4 \\"The Royale\\" Enteprise crew become trapped in a casino novel where they must play out the parts. Fairly interesting. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42679.2 \\"Time Squared\\" Enterprise crew discovers a duplicate Capt. Picard, who tells them that his ship was destroyed and theirs will be too. 4 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42686.4 \\"The Icarus Factor\\" It seems to be a requirement for Starfleet that it's officers have bad parental relationships.  Riker's father comes on board, and they haven't spoken for over ten years. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42685.3 \\"Pen Pals\\" Data sends messages to a child and tries to save her when her planet is almost destroyed. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42761.3 \\"Q Who\\" Q sends the Enterprise across the galaxy, where they have their first encounter with the terrifying Borg. AWESOME! 4 stars  <br /> <br />Stardate 42779.1 \\"Samaritan Snare\\" Geordi is captured by a race a race of rather slow aliens called the Pakleds. Not one of the best. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42823.2 \\"Up the Long Ladder\\" Two groups of cloned human colonists need Enterprise's help their planet isdestroyed and their races begin to die.  2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42859.2 \\"Manhunt\\" Lwaxana Troi tries to make Picard fall in love with her.  Always a mini-theme between the two of them. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42901.3 \\"The Emissary\\" Worf and a former love interest must find a Klingon ship that still thinks the Federation and the Empire are at war and keep the Enterprise from getting destroyed. 3 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42923.4 \\"Peak Performance\\" War simulations turn deadly when the Ferengi show up, and Data has to go against an arrogant visitor in a game. 2 stars <br /> <br />Stardate 42976.1 \\"Shades of Gray\\" Riker looks like he's going to die due to an organism that invaded his brain.  Dr. Pulaski uses his negative emotions to kill it.  Her last appearance. (hooray) 2 stars <br /> <br />A little better than the first season...it does get better.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The screenplay for \\"The Machinist\\" called for a \\"walking skeleton.\\" Christian Bale achieved the look all right. <br /> <br />Thin? No. Anorexic would be the place to start. <br /> <br />The weight loss in itself is a reason to watch the film, a meditation on the tricks a guilty mind can play. But \\"The Machinist,\\" directed by Brad Anderson, is also an effective little psychothriller, fueled by Bale's wry humor as Trevor Reznick, who works the second shift at a parts plant and has been steadily losing weight for months. He's down to 120 pounds. His kinda-girlfriend Stevie(Jennifer Jason Leigh) is an aging call girl. His friends talk about how he \\"used to be all right.\\" He hasn't slept in a year. <br /> <br />And now he's won a stalker named Ivan (John Sharian) a big, bald, creepy dude who distracts Trevor into causing a co-worker (Michael Ironside) to lose his arm in a plant accident. The men he used to fish and play poker with want him gone; his boss wants him fired. And somebody, maybe Ivan, is leaving Post-It Notes in Trevor's apartment with a hangman on it.  <br /> <br />The only respite comes in waitress Marie (Aitana Gijon-Sanchez) at the airport cafe who serves Trevor coffee and pie after his shift. Marie is warm and friendly. She has a son and, a bit inexplicably, a heart for Trevor, who spoils her with big tips. Her character holds a key to Trevor's past, which he only begins to understand when he joins Marie on Mother's Day, at the amusement park.  <br /> <br />Scott Kosar's script cleverly explains the root of Trevor's warped reality - a scene in Marie's apartment, looking back on the film, doesn't make much sense - but the mood of the film is effective whether the loose ends are all tied up or not.  <br /> <br />Bale's performance rachets up the insanity bit by bit, accompanied by the same black humor he employed in \\"American Psycho.\\" Equally comic and macabre, Bale's very appearance is performance. At that weight, there's probably a cockeyed clarity aboutthe world kicks in. What sustains you? What nurtures you? Severe anorexics talk of an emptiness more comforting that whatever could fill it. Trevor is at that point. He just wants to know why. <br /> <br />Anderson goes for a drab, despairing look. Long nights, dark skies, empty fields, a cold ocean. He avoids theatrics; the film isn't a series of smash cuts, freeze frames and double exposures. Instead, Trevor inhabits a life of permanently dim, flourescent lighting. It's a foggy, sterile, frightening place.  <br /> <br />\\"What if I become a werewolf?\\" he asks Stevie, after she's promised to quit the hooker life for him. Stevie jokes a little. A few minutes later, Trevor is certain Ivan and Stevie are connected, and he isn't laughing.

If only all today's albums could be as good as this...<br />80's funk tracks like \\"Love X Love\\" and \\"Give Me The Night\\" are just timeless classic club songs!<br />His cover of James Moody's \\"Moody's Mood\\" is simply irresistible: what a smooth and dreamy song! (and the vocals from Patti Austin are just superb too). Wonderful isn't enough to describe such a song.<br />\\"What's On Your Mind\\" is one of my favorite because of this laidback melody. Another great song in an album overflowing with them.<br />Latin-flavoured \\"Dinorah, Dinorah\\" and jazz funk-tinged \\"Off Broadway\\" are 2 excellent instrumental songs, which prove that Benson is one of the best guitar players ever.<br />\\"Love Dance\\" and \\"Star of a story\\" are sweet songs, with melancholic melodies, while \\"Midnight Love Affair\\" is the perfect late-night soundtrack, as the title say.<br />To finish, \\"Turn Out The Lamplight\\" is as smooth and intoxicating as any track on the album.<br />I think this is one of the very rare albums I could listen in shuffle.<br />This album was produced by Quincy Jones, and all I can say is that this guy too is a genius! According to me, this album is as good as the albums \\"Off The Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\" he produced for Michael Jackson\\"<br />A beautiful blend of smooth jazz, quiet storm and funk. Soulful, soothing, laidback, dreamy... simply magnificent<br />Hails to the great George Benson! If you are into great music, please have this cd in your collection
B00005JKHP|3.0|This movie is slow, slow, slow and very plotless, and yet every once in a while, I am drawn to watching it again.  If you're a fan of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and I am, big time!), then the special effects here are probably enough to keep you interested.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is new, original and exciting (and later used for \\"The Next Generation\\"). <br /> <br />Because this is not my favor TREK film, taping it off of HBO at a slow speed was good enough for me.  I cannot comment on the DVD edition, although I've often found these director's editions to be a waste of space.  There's a reason many of these lost scenes don't make it to the final print in the first place. <br /> <br />By the way, Scotty has been officially \\"beamed up\\".  We'll miss him.  Aye. <br />
B0002V7O3I|4.0|I remember watching this movie when I was a kid.  I identified with it since I spent my summers tinkering and building stuff.  Better than most of the kid's movies they put out now.
0792843584|2.0|After 25 years, I finally decided to commit myself to watching the entire 4-hour epic that nearly brought United Artists down back in 1980. <br /> <br />For those who don't know the backstory, this film from Michael Cimino, who'd already scored Oscar success with THE DEER HUNTER in 1978, not only forced UA to merge with MGM to save their assess, but it also ended the independent, creative run that many new and young directors had enjoyed for the past decade.  The decade \\"under the influence\\" which had began with films like EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE, officially ended with HEAVEN'S GATE. <br /> <br />For it's few good points, the film has beautiful cinematography, good camera work and good performances from the cast.  The story, however, is very weak and very, very slow (makes 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY look like an action film). <br /> <br />Other than a minor hit with YEAR OF THE DRAGON in 1985, poor Cimino's career never recovered from this bomb, and it looks like it never will.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|Bond, which debuted in 2000, has become the best-selling female string quartet in the world, so it's no surprise that five years later, a collection of some of their best has been released with three brand-new tracks.   <br /> <br />A breakdown of the tracks:  <br />Victory (5/5):  Their debut single and one of their strongest ever is a great way to start off the album, with slick background music blending nicely with their instruments. <br /> <br />Explosive (10/5): One of my all-time favorite Bond tracks, the single is....well...explosive and features a great backing orchestra and strong performances by the girls. <br /> <br />Fuego (5/5): Their first single off \\"Shine\\" is reminiscent of Victory but different in its delivery.  It's got a quicker pace and is much more relentless but is very satisfying.  <br /> <br />Viva! (4/5): This one starts off brilliantly with just the girls playing acoustically but soon jumps into a more dance-remix tune for the rest of it, with the background music almost overpowering them.  They still come through but not as clear as they could've. <br /> <br />Shine (5/5): Another of their strongest songs, this one has a very Indian feel to it and is set apart from their other songs.  <br /> <br />Wintersun (4/5): This is the truncated version of Winter (which I prefer) which is found on \\"Born.\\" It's a brilliant dance track, with the perfect blend of instruments and dance beats.   <br /> <br />Scorchio (3/5): This one I've never felt that Bond fully delivered on.  The opening is huge and enveloping, and then it goes....soft.  It's a good track, but not as good as it could have been. <br /> <br />Duel (10/5!!): My all-time favorite by them, it's exactly what the title says.  A \\"duel\\" between Haylie and Eos, the playing is absolutely brilliant and leaves you wanting more.  This is Bond at their best.  Anyone who's seen them perform this live knows what I mean. <br /> <br />Gypsy Rhapsody (5/5): Different from other songs, it definitely is reminiscent of the gypsy sound.  It's a great song that never stops. <br /> <br />Caravan (4/5): The first of three new tracks, this is soft song with an Arabian feel.  It kind of reminds you of the background music in Aladdin in a way.  A great track. <br /> <br />Sugarplum (10/5): I love this song!  Adapted from \\"The Nutcracker\\" it's a very familiar song.  The mix of backing music and the way they break up the music make it their own.   <br /> <br />Carmina (3/5): A generally good track.  It's repetitive, but it's catchy.  A good way to end the CD, but could have went out stronger. <br /> <br />The DVD side is very good.  While I don't have the system to enjoy the surround album, the music videos are exceptional and high quality.  The discography is handy, especially for new fans who want to get more of their music.  Overall, it's a CD that every music fan should get.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is the best movie ever.It is perfectly made.Quentin Tarantino just ceases to amaze me with his amazing movies.If you dont like this movie then you should just burn in hell because it is just perfect and you should shut up for being so retarded.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|First off, don't even look at the review by Tiffany Burnsmier, she's a silly bitch that wrote a review about the VHS version, not the Director's Cut, which does in fact have all the FABULOUS scenes she whining about being missing! The fact that she gave it one star and RUINED the average and didn't bother research what she was bashing, well I'll challenge her to a chicken fight any day!!<br /><br />I have been a fan of John Waters since the ripe young age of 8 when I first saw Polyesther, much to my mothers dismay. I got to see Hairspray for my 13th birthday, and well then she began to understand. So the release of Cry Baby on DVD was huge event in my life, being just one week after my 30th birthday, I can say I have loved this man's mind for almost a lifetime. I used to try to tape this version off of USA's Up All Night, and later TIVO it from of all channels the WE channel. But commercial's NO MORE!! Not to mention, \\"It came from Baltimore\\" is an excellent documantary, one to watched many times, as you see and hear such idols as Van Smith and Pat Moran discuss details of the film and Dreamland and so much more.<br /><br />I was on cloud 9 watching the new DVD on my huge high def TV in surround sound, quality that has been missing since the theatre version!<br /><br />This DVD is VERY affordably priced and SO very worth it!!
B00000IMTH|5.0|This hard rock release is as classic and perfect as they come! Powerful, dark, brooding, Medieval vocals and music as seen through the perfection of Dio's awesome voice and Blackmore's clockwork, highly emotive and technical guitar playing. 'Gates Of Babylon' is quite possibly one of the most masterful and creative heavy rock compositions EVER! Alas, they sure don't write great rock music like this anymore.
B00000ADG2|4.0|I think the thing about Lauren Hill is she actually has a singing voice; She must have had some singing lessons or something. So most of the emotion she sings with is justified by her ability to carry it. She doesn't oversing that much, either. She isn't forever reaching for high notes, mostly she stays within herself. She also doesn't do much 'forcing' of her notes, quite rare amongst female (and a lot of male) vocalists these days. Her vocal delivery is fairly natural. Perhaps that is why this album was so gushed over at the time. I remember TV commercials about it a lot at the time. Plus give her credit for writing 14 songs on her own.    I actually really like modern soul, it's more \\"groovalicious\\" than it was back when. Most of these songs are great songs and they have such great grooves. I like the song 'Superstar' with it's harpsichord and harp. 'When it hurts so bad' is also a great track, with it's dreamy harp-filled chorus and tribal rhythms. Plus the title track and 'Nothing even matters' are gorgeous soul ballads. When Lauren Hill strikes a note in a relaxed manner, the result is often the audio equivalent of seeing red wine being poured into a glass. Another song I find interesting is Ex-factor, a 70's-ish soul ballad but as I said before these modern soul recordings have such groovy beats. On that song she tries singing in her higher register all the time and she handles it 'ok'. It's a really pretty song.     However, my favourite track has to be 'Sweetest Thing', she sings it brilliantly and it's such a melodic and beautiful song. I also like her cover of the Franki Valli Staple 'Can't take my eyes off you'.    In my estimation, it's a pretty good album, and one you'll want to play a lot.
0440180295|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I finished. It absorbed me after the first page because of what it was telling me.    My father was also in the Battle of the Bulge.  After all the horrible things he witnessed and experienced, his most significant concern expressed was what it took to keep his feet warm - the last thing he wants to do is dwell on a more significant event of burying several dozen men who were mowed down by the Germans. (I learned at a young age to never screw with our thermostat at home!)    How does this relate to the book?  The book jelled a thought I have had for some time.  To handle the difficult, we focus on what we can deal with, and for the rest we create abstractions from other elements of our past that can cloud it, explain it, justifify it, forget it etc.  In the case of SH5, Billy Pilgrim used science fiction to put horrible things into a perspective that was acceptable - it just happens, it's suppose to, it always will!     Except for the concept of aging on earth, SH5 makes you look at life and realize there truly is no beginning, no middle, no end - just a series of often unrelated events brought to us or created by us.  You can not choose the events always, but sooner or later you will choose what to believe and how you want to believe - interestingly enough, that's not always a choice in the purest sense either.
2266144340|3.0|I don't know why there is so much buzz about this book, it really wasn't that fantastic.  There were several problems with the story throughout the book that keep me from truly enjoying the story.<br /><br />The first and biggest problem was character development.  We really don't know anything about  the main character Robert Langdon other than he is a well known professor, and perhaps he travels a lot,  I don't know.  I do know that there are other books starring this same character, so maybe his personality was developed in a earlier novel.  That doesn't help the readers of this book though.<br /><br />All we know about the Sophie character is that she is a detective of some sort, she is French , her grandfather was a well known museum curator and she is a bit of a prude.  If I had seen my grandfather doing what her grandfather was doing, I would definitely be traumatized.  I don't think I would cut him off for it, maybe make fun of him or something, but that is just me.<br /><br />The only character we know anything significant about is Silas, the albino monk.  We know something of his past and the way his mind works. That is really important for the reader to understand his motives for doing certain things. Unfortunately he is a villain, a murderer to be exact, but I still find that I have much sympathy and a bit of empathy for him.<br /><br />Another problem with the book is the CONSTANT foreshadowing. For instance, the narrator would say something like, \\"Little did so and so know, this or that will happen in a few hours.\\"  This would be fine if it was used once or twice to add suspense and anticipation, but it is used constantly.  It got to the point, to me, of it being laughable.  We don't need to know that something or another will happen sooner or later, just let it happen when it does.<br /><br />My last issue with this novel is the short, choppy chapters.  I like a good  hardy chapter of 20 pages or more, but in this book there are a lot of 1 or 2 pages chapters that drove me crazy.  Brown changes viewpoints and settings so much so that I felt like I was being pulled in too many directions at once.<br /><br />Also the ending was a bit of a bust.  Id been expecting something like that throughout the whole book, but I was hoping it would be a little more shocking and a little more interesting. Frankly I didn't really care.  Maybe other people will find this to be a revelation and perhaps true, but its really nothing new to me.  I'm somewhat of a history buff.<br /><br />I wonder if Brown believes that there is a Priori of Sion or if the little note in the beginning of the book is there to add drama. I, however, am fairly sure that it does not exist. It is the brainchild of a rather offbeat Frenchman looking for fame.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book?  Yes, I it read fairly quickly , a day or so, thus it was a page turner.  Also, I enjoyed the talk of different artworks and there possible hidden meanings, it was fun to read.  I suggest getting the version with the referenced artwork photos, because I had to keep looking online for pictures of what they were talking about.<br /><br />I think the reason I was so disappointed with this book is that I was expecting something much better and more original because of all the media attention.  So my advice is to ignore the buzz, go in with low expectations and then you might be able to enjoy this read.changes viewpoints and settings so much so that I felt like I was being pulled in too many directions at once.

0670033375|5.0|The over-exploitation of natural resources is the subject.  Since exploitation has vastly accelerated globally over the last 100 years, the question is:   Will the immense power of technology exploit world's resources to exhaustion - leaving mankind a Malthusian existence on the edge of survival?  Or will technology be a panacea that will enable western civilization to increase the world's resources to utopian horn of plenty?  And is there anything can we do anything to ensure the latter?  This is exciting book that brought forth critical issues on worldwide resource exploitation and allocation, population controls and trends.  It certainly raised my awareness of some of the issues and ties in very closely with Jeff Sach's The End of Poverty, and David Landes The Wealth and Poverty of Nations.   Collapse  is something I enthusiastically recommend to all.    Reader's reactions were also varied and interesting such as one by Victor David Hansen, a professor of the classics from Fresno CA, and farmer, who attacks Diamond with gusto, claiming that Diamond's determinist idea of that natural accidents resulting in the present-day dominance of the West is pure bunk and that Environment, far from being a precondition for Western success, was often almost irrelevant.  Hansen is a learned individual who has a flair for writing in an exciting almost poetic manner.  It is puzzling that he should make statements that the environment is irrelevant to a society and deny that societies have suffered greatly from exhaustion of resources.   Also, as a farmer in the Fresno area, I'm sure he is aware of the soil salinization issues of the San Joaquin Valley.   Hansen did point out that in Guns Germs and Steel, Diamond romanticized New Guinea.  As I recall, Diamond wrote that the tradeoff between Western Society and the strong family of the New Guineans was more or less equal, which I found was bothersome, particularly since he had to have western medical treatment for illnesses he contracted there.

B000002C1W|5.0|Pink Floyd at its best. PF comes up with a new sound (again).  It's fresh and new yet remains Pink Floyd. This CD has become my favorite PF one. Remember when PF was on the edge, well, this one brings them back to their amazingly creative edge,  with a killer sound. It's a must own.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Pretty bad special effects opus that insults more than entertains with a script that is full of cliches and inconstancies. Keanu Reeves is a ok actor when he's not faced with something challenging but he's criminally miscast as the detective who has a hand on the pulse of the supernatural. His presence lacks credibility and the reading of his lines of painfully funny in the wrong kind of way. Rachel Weisz on the up side does more with her character than the movie does with itself, giving a haunting and powerful performance that is WAY too good for this movie.  She almost does too much for this film, while the film really does not do anything for her at all, that's how good she is. Shia LaBeouf is alright but his overdoes his comedy stick way too much for his own good, making him more annoying than useful and Djimon Hounsou is criminally underused in a stereo type role and he's way more talented than Keanu himself.  The special effects were decent and some of the cinematography was great in showing the aspects of hell but with out a good a script or a real leading man, the movie is only held together by Weisz's performance but  she like the audience is let down by the climax, which really pulls the rest of the film apart and makes it into a three ring circus.
B0000640VO|3.0|Amelie, or Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain as the movie is known in French, is firmly in the tradition of French romantic comedy films. This genre of film has a particular sensibility which can seem cutesy or cloyingly sweet and unquestioning; yet films in this genre often have little surprises which remind the viewer that this is after all a French film, and not subject to the rules of cutesy films in English.  <br /> <br />It's a very well made film, with beautiful cinematography, REALLY excellent acting by great French film actors, and above all many, many long takes shot in some of the most characteristic neighborhoods and around some of the most famous public buildings in Paris. This film is a love song to Paris. You could turn the sound off and just watch it with no subtitles, and you would both understand the plot and be moved by the plot and the beauty of the visuals. <br /> <br />But by snooty intellectual standards, it's a bit sentimental, although with liberal doses of wit and bite. It's not a challenging film which questions darkly the basic foundations of society or anything like that. Several times in the course of the film a character turns and impishly addresses the camera, which will give you an idea of the somwehat juvenile sensibility. And this is appropriate, because after all it is about a woman who has not yet quite grown up.  <br /> <br />There was a controversy about the film: people objected that Amelie, who is a waitress at a cafe/bar, lives in Paris: that would never happen in real life, because she couldn't afford it. And the neighborhood in which most of the action takes place is populated largely by immigrants from Africa -- yet only one character in the whole film is played by an actor of North African descent. It's a lily-white, golden- and sepia-toned dreamy look at what many French people no doubt wish France was like: it harkens back to a mythical golden France-that-never-was, where, as Nancy Reagan once let slip over a publicmicrophone, there are \\"all these lovely white people\\".  <br /> <br />So it's sappy and a little silly, but in a witty and unexpected way, and it's beautiful. And the message is kind of a good one, on balance: Amelie cares a lot about others but needs at some point to start living her own life.  <br /> <br />The acting is top-notch, and even the accents of the characters are carefully placed and perfectly complement the emotional architecture of the film. There are some witty digressions in quick montage form of \\"what might have happened\\", a la the movie Run, Lola, Run, which are quite funny. Much of this film is funny. <br /> <br />So if you like French stuff, and don't mind a bit of schmaltz with some hot pepper popping up here and there, this movie is for you. I give it a five for visuals, a five for acting, a three for plot, a four for the dynamics of interpersonal relations and the questions explored around them, and a one for the studied avoidance of any social questions like immigration or how people who work for a living in Paris really live. <br /> <br />I quite enjoyed it.
B000002GK1|5.0|This cd will appeal to alternative and metal fans, espeacially since this is a guitar heavy and heart pounding drumming of an album.This album could have been a quick-essential grundge album if not released in the same month as nevermind by Nirvana.Cornell has a voice that can sound melodic to eeriely frightening in a song.Thayil has some great riffs in badmotor finger.songs to listen 1 2 3 4 7 8 11. Get this and you'll love it. If you own it. listen to it again.
B00004Z400|5.0|Possibly one of the best albums in the last five years came from a california band called Deftones.This album can take you from mezmerizing to hardcore and back again.Chino has a voice that can transcend soft to hardcore.Stef is a great guitarist who gave one of his best work here.Abe is such a fantastic drummer you would think they had two four armed drummers.Best song here is Passenger featuring Maynard James Keenan from Tool and APC.This song can put you in a trance with one of best collabos in rock history.Elite,which won them the grammy for best metal performance in '01,is hard but you need to listen to it and you will love it.Just buy this album, listen to it, and you will be satisfied with this. <br />
B000002L68|4.0|After a recent play on cable, I was reminded of just how laughably bad the film Purple Rain is.  But during the same screening, it hit me like the proverbial bricks why the film was such a huge hit, and it wasn't just Prince's music, which was fresh and innovative and wildy popular, but the way the man performed.  Laugh as you will at the rehashed plotlines from every tortured-artist film you've ever seen, and the terribly wooden acting by everyone except, perhaps, Morris Day, but these songs at this time with these performers will still give you chills.  As will this CD.
B00000IQC8|1.0|I hated this movie the first time I saw it.  It wasn't the low budget style that bothered me; it was mostly the way the male characters view the female characters in the movie as either bitches or ho's.  So then I talked to many people who loved it and I thought maybe I should see it again, this time in a theatre with a midnight movie audience of people who love it.  I still hated it.  I've heard Kevin Smith got better with age - but after also renting Mallrats and hating that, too I am reluctant to spend more time on him or his work.  I'm not going to waste a lot of time going into detail about why I hated it - this is just my opinion and my gut reaction.  I also am writing this because I usually only bother writing reviews of movies I love - so I figured I should write at least one review of a movie I passionately hate.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This was the best new show of this year. This was probably the best show in a long time. I was hooked from the first episode. I didn't miss one episode during the season and I can't stop watching the re-runs now during the summer.

Simple Plan and Sum 41 and Blink-182 and good charlotte and other posers like them are a joke, how did they get there start in the music biz?giving head? probably... <br /> <br />Still not getting any...wonder why?either cause they are gay or because their lousy music turns all the chicks away and turns on 10 year old girls.(thats against the law, guys from simple plan) <br /> <br />anyways this CD is just pure crap, do not waste your money and time on this. want a good CD? go buy master of puppets or reign in blood or bonded by blood, not this crap!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|As someone who owns over 200 albums,this is one of my top 5 of all time.The album starts of with the Package, a song that goes from dark to heavy in it 7 minutes of trance inducing vibes.Second is Weak and Powerless,I believe the first single,and then Noose which shows this band can come together to make a great song.BUT my favorite song and maybe their hardest track is Pet,a song that deals with the government trying to \\"protect us\\" from evil doers in this world.Billy is such a good guitarist and backround singer that him and maynard go off well as in that song.Lastly is gravity, a slow yet poingnant song to end this album.Even if your into metal or alternative you will like this well made complex album.
B00070Q7VO|2.0|I've tried to listen to 'Home' all the way through when it comes on an easy listening station. I haven't been able to make it through yet. Awful stuff. Whiney, pitying, 'poor me' glop.
0316172324|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone.  VERY well written.  Sometimes individuals (and groups) make decisions that are beneficial, but sometimes destructive.  The author presents simply fascinating insight into why /how individuals (and groups) make decisions \\"in the blink of an eye\\".  While that may not sound very interesting on the surface, I assure you that the way it is presented /written by Gladwell, you will enjoy every page of this book.  Not only will you enjoy it, you'll learn a lot about yourself and human nature.  I read it in one sitting - simply couldn't put it down!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I have to say that this is the best, most amazing metal band I have ever heard. The Oncoming Storm is just an incredible album. Pure genius is the only way to describe it. From the awesome drums, to the mind-blowing, inexplicable guitar riffs--You just couldn't ask for anything more. Fantastic CD.

6305949980|5.0|I watched Tim Burton's TNBC for the first time last night and plan to watch it several times more before puting it away for the Holidays. The animation is amazing, breathtaking  and the idea of a combination Halloween/Christmas story is truly genius! Brovo TB! I was captivated from the first scene and wished I could live in Halloweentown (definatly my kind of town) and Christmastown (is a truly magical and beautiful town)  or at least visit them both. Jack Skeleton even shares a valuable lesson, about opposites and knowing what we are born to and best of all, it's a love story. Best 'Nightmare' I've ever had!
1401301363|4.0|There is a mistake in the body of the recipe that may lead you to believe the cake contains butter. Supposedly, it does not, and this was a mistake on the part of the American publisher. I want future purchasers to know this so you won't have to spend an agonizing afternoon like I just did, second-guessing a recipe (and guessing wrong that butter does belong in the cake) the day before I planned to serve this cake at a party. (It's gluten free, great for your celiac friends.) <br /> <br />Now that I've got THAT off my chest ... I love this book! It made Christmas dinner a hit (the Brussels sprout recipe is divine!), and it is beautiful to look at and a pleasure to read, as are all of Nigella's books. Just mark that butter thing on the chocolate orange cake, and you'll be fine.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is not the Beatles' best album; Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Abbey Road are all stronger contenders. But this seems to be the album that I listen to the most after all these years. \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Dear Prudence\\", and \\"Revolution 1\\" are particular favorites.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|While some might gripe about the lack of new material on this collection, very few (and I only say this because I don't own all of them) of the sets in the \\"The Essential\\" series of compilations have anything new on them. The point is to make available an affordable compilation of an artist's hits over the course of their career. This is especially useful in the cases of artists who have had career highlights on various labels, such as Johnny Cash or Michael Jackson.  In the case of Jacko's collection, this is the only 2-disc set on the market that contains tracks dating from the J5 years to the present, so it's valuable to those who want a lot of his hits in one purchase but don't want to buy the J5's greatest hits, a compilation of pre-Off the Wall hits and then another compilation that covers from Off the Wall to the present. <br /> <br />There are a few glaring omissions to be noted, though: \\"Dancing Machine,\\" \\"Scream\\" (with Janet), and \\"Say Say Say\\" (with Paul McCartney) deserve to be on here. \\"Blood on the Dancefloor\\" is a personal favorite of mine that would've been nice to get without having to buy a remix album, too, but it's inessential (then again, so is \\"Dangerous,\\" which made it on).  Overall, though, I recommend it for those who want a 2-disc Jackson fix in 1 purchase.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I just saw this again for the 1st time in about ten years now. The good news is that its still a great film. I mean it has it all in a hestitant hero, greedy locals, a lousy Mayor, A Crazy Ship's Captain, a smart alack rich kid expert and a perfect eating machine. All you need more is the popcorn and a couple of cold ones. Well done to all hands!
B0007GAERG|4.0|Yes, it took a while and there were a quite a few moments of doubt but Mariah Carey has managed to bring out an album that encompasses all the things we miss about the good old days. The Diva: female vocalist who has tangible talent, commands respect by first respecting herself and has a voice that makes the hair on the back of your neck tingle. <br /> <br />Mariah is one of the few Divas to have survived through the ages. From Whitney, Celine to Christina; Mariah's name still calls for a gush of breath as we recall the strength of her voice and the soulfulness of her music. Her style is a fussion of amazing vocal ability and in being in touch with what the current generation want to hear. <br /> <br />I think this album is definately one of her best so far, as it reflects the personal changes Mariah has gone through in a way that is shown through the production on this album. True, her voice may not be as strong as it used to be (take note of her clarity on previous albums) but she still knows how to work it. <br /> <br />Undoubtedly, she couldn't have come back at a better time. Mariah, we really missed you.
B000005IS1|5.0|One things for certain with this CD...it has an intensity you very seldom find in live acts and almost NEVER find in studio recordings. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find a performance more intense than what the MC5 accomplished with this recording. And that's kinda what the band was aiming to catch in the first place: raw, real rock n' roll intensity, and they knew they wouldn't be able to do it in a studio. Nice move fellas.  <br /> <br />Kick Out the Jams, and Rocket Reducer in particular definitely sound ahead of their time, as Rob Tyner's strained (but soulful) screaming, the guitarists' powerchord onslaught and the minimalistic drumming come together to create punk before there WAS punk. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have stated before me, crank this up loud! You're in for one hell of a ride.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|The selling point of \\"Bullitt\\" has always been the car chase through the streets of San Francisco.  It is indeed thrilling and tops most latter day CGI enhanced action sequences by a thousand miles.  To me, though, there is a throwaway scene in the film that defines Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt.  It takes place in a corner market that Bullitt enters after pulling an all-nighter.  Bullitt goes to the freezer section and indiscriminately scoops up a stack of TV dinners.  This is the essence of Bullitt, a cop so dedicated to his job that he pays little mind to his basic sustainance.  As a policer, this film is top-notch.  I rank this film in the pantheon of \\"The French Connection\\" and \\"Heat\\" for police dramas.  The film concerns itself with the murder of a prosecution witness and Bullitt's efforts to apprehend his killers.  Bullitt, a complete straight-shooter, has to not only deal with hitmen during the course of his investigation but also a meddling district attorney played by a slimy Robert Vaughn in top form here.  There is a good supporting cast here that includes Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt's girlfriend.  This part could have been mere window dressing but Bissett has a scene where she confronts Bullitt about his choice of occupation and it's effect on his psyche that is quite effective.  The inimitable Simon Oakland(\\"Psycho\\", \\"The Sand Pebbles\\", TV's \\"The Night Stalker) gives a solid account as Bullitt's no bull superior.  This is not just essential McQueen but essential viewing as well.
B000005YZM|5.0|It's really unfair to compare every pop record that came out in the late 60's to either Sgt. Pepper or Pet Sounds, especially considering \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" is a masterpiece just as those two albums are. The most that can be said is similar between the albums is that they are pop records...and that's a very broad statement. All previous comparisons aside, \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" is a psychedelic masterpiece that can stand on it's own as one of the greatest pop records ever released...no joking. <br /> <br />Care of Cell 44, A Rose for Emily (which is remarkably beautiful),  I Want Her She Wants Me, This Will Be Our Year, and Time of the Season are all pop gems that deserve to be heard by any ear that will listen. What's really remarkable about this record is how effortlessly the Zombies churned out upbeat pop, brooding psychedelia and some of the most beautiful numbers (reaching a beauty the Beatles only rarely reached in their songs) all on the same piece of vinyl. As I said, A Rose for Emily is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. They had a real knack for that beauty, but at the same time songs like \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" in all of it's horn heavy triumphant glory holds it's own on the same record. <br /> <br />It would take more than I can type to express my love of this record. As a fan of music (that's right, just music in general) you owe it to yourself to buy this record, just as much as Sgt. Pepper or Pet Sounds.
B000002GB2|5.0|Is there such a thing as \\"pretty\\" hard rock? This first recording by the band for the A&M label may be it. Here, you will find power guitar chords accented with sweet, mellifluous harmonies. It took Styx five albums to achieve the perfection they found on Equinox. This is the best and, in my opinion, the last Styx album. With John Curulewski's departure and Tommy Shaw's arrival on \\"Crystal Ball,\\" the band became less a cohesive unit and more a compilation of solo projects. Hear Styx during this rare moment of power, creativity and innocence. <br />
B0000025DI|5.0|I'm a life-time Bob affectionado and have heard nearly everything he's done and have also seen him a dozen times or so. At first I bought into the critics and didn't care too much for this album or the tour for this album. But after listening to it for a couple of years it could not be ignored. I think it is as good as anything he's ever put out. I rank it with Highway 61 and Blood on the Tracks as his overall top albums in terms of quality and consistency. Gotta Serve Somebody, Infidels and Nashville Skyline are way up there too. I still can't relate to Big Red Sky, Knocked Out Loaded or Down in the Groove (except for Silvio which rocks).
0385338686|3.0|After five stellar novels by Sophie Kinsella, you could definitely say that I am a fan of her work. She has a wonderful way of creating vivid, endearing characters that get into all sorts of mishaps. Her latest offering, \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\", however, sort of disappointed me. <br /> <br />Meet Samantha Sweeting. A highly intelligent and workaholic attorney for a prestigious law firm, she is over-stressed and high-strung. Even during a spa treatment for her 29th birthday, she can't bear to tear herself away from her blackberry or cell phone. About to be made partner at the firm, she is known for her competence and brains. <br /> <br />However, on the day she is supposed to have her partnership announced, she discovers she has made a huge error costing one of the firm's clients over 50 million pounds. And she completely loses it. She stumbles out of the office, onto the nearest train, and manages to somehow get mistaken for a housekeeper seeking a job. And... she ends up getting a housekeeper job at the Geiger residence. <br /> <br />The only problem is, Samantha doesn't even know how to turn on an iron, let alone wash clothes, cook fancy dinners, or sew. Although she \\"accidentally\\" mentions to the Geigers that she is highly skilled in those areas. (Shades of Becky Bloomwood, indeed!) <br /> <br />This book started off really good. I liked that the main character was very intelligent and had an interesting career at a law firm. The book has Kinsella's trademark wit, humor and lively storytelling. As always, the other characters were endearing and interesting. I did have a hard time putting this novel down for the first several chapters. <br /> <br />But unfortunately, things went sort of downhill. For one thing, everything just happens WAY too conveniently and coincidentally for Samantha. As a matter of fact, most of the novel is based on things that just \\"happened\\" somehow. The entire novel is too far-fetched. Samantha somehow goes from not knowing how to even use an iron to someone cooking, cleaning and mending happily within 3 short weeks, among other things. It's ridiculous. I feel that Kinsella should have spent more time fleshing the plot out more realistically. One should not have to suspend THAT much disbelief in a fiction novel! <br /> <br />And the ending? Perhaps had this been a fairy tale, it would have had the perfect ending. For a chick lit novel, it was just too trite and hackneyed. Without giving away the ending, I can't go into further details, but I was disappointed about the choices Samantha made. And the events leading up to the ending were just ludicrous of the eye-rolling variety. <br /> <br />Kinsella's breezy and enjoyable writing style saved this book from being a total disaster, but overall it was nothing more than an average read - much less than what I've come to expect from this author. I do however recommend this book to chick lit/fiction fans alike for a light, humorous, romantic summer novel - if they are willing to deal with such an unbelievable plot.
B0006L16N8|5.0|For all of the people that continually say that \\"Speed of Sound\\" is \\"Clocks Part Two\\".....YOURE WRONG.....the only similarity in the song is that the opening riff is played using piano....thats about it.  This album sounds nothing like \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and that album sounds nothing like \\"Parachutes\\".  Thats what I like about this band, that they are constantly maturing musically, yet sticking to what they do best.  This is their masterpiece.....and its made for arenas.....im sure theyll be good live.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Let me be the 253rd person to say that this movie is BRILLIANT with a capital Z. Anyone who gives this film less than 5 stars doesn't fully appreciate what they have seen. I'm not the pickiest guy on the planet when it comes to films, but I do have high standards to everyone else's annoyance; so let me assure you this movie is worth buying.  <br />Quentin Tarantino said it was the best film he saw all year. That has to mean something. I'd say it too, but who cares what I think. <br /> <br />I won't go over the plot again as I'm sure you've read about the movie from all these other comments. I'll just say it one more time, Buy this DVD! The comedy is superb, The horror is genuinely frightening, the emotion is touching and real - all at the same time.  <br /> <br />There is a reason why this is an instant cult classic.
B00006DEFA|4.0|For those already familiar with this fine multi-Oscar-winning film, this director's cut makes for a darker, more cynical viewing experience. While certain character motivations can be said to be better fleshed out (no pun intended!), it can also be said that the tone of the entire film is now more in line with Mozart's ultimate drive toward exhaustion and near-madness in the midst of constant money problems. Though nothing has been deleted, this is now a film for adults.<br /><br />The original theater release seemed to have a \\"nicer\\" balance of humor and dark drama and could be said to be appropriate entertainment for mature children.<br /><br />The music is still marvelous.  The performances are all first-rate.  The scenes are brilliantly staged and shot. The film overall, however, probably suffers more than previous from its weighty extended length.  Also, some of the scenes did seem a little more darkly lit than I remember, almost to the point of distraction.<br /><br />This 2-DVD package has loads of extras and it's still a worthy view if you loved the original; just make sure the little ones aren't around. It is rated R.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|As has been said many times and in many places, this is not a Hellblazer movie.  This John Constantine is excruciatingly grave instead of charmingly smarmy.  He's not British, a crucial aspect of his character. And he doesn't smoke anywhere near enough.  But if you can ignore all that, this actually is a pretty decent movie.    The visual effects are sharp and the stylized look and colors make everything seem a little otherwordly, which adds to the ambience nicely.  It was also interesting as a fan of the comic to see aspects of many different story lines in there.  There were even some scenes and dialogue lifted right off the page, the camera framing it into a moving comic panel. <br /> <br />Could the acting be better in some instances?  Sure but most genre films have a couple cringe worthy part.  Is the movie laughably melodramatic and cliched at times?  Ibid, see above. Do they completely change some characters?  Just look at Chas for your answer.  But I think it will surprise you if you give it half a chance.  At the very least, it will be fun for fans of the comic to pick out all the little Hellblazer details.
0446677450|4.0|I thought this book was helpful for a first time investor. It gives simplified information that everyone can understand. Kiyosaki's stories are helpful in understanding the material, but sometimes seem arrogant. Much of the material was repeated which was unneccessary. The book also needed to be edited more carefully for there were a few mistakes.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Most of the complaints on here are legitimate.  They should have cut the songs at certain points and been done with them.  The problem with these complaints ,however, is that they fail to understand the perspective Mars Volta is coming from.  Or maybe they understand the perspective but would really prefer not to take a trip with the band.  People...all of these tracks were most likely written under the influence of a some really bad drugs.  Most likely acid.  The same people who hate \\"Frances the Mute\\" probably are the same people who criticize \\"Natural Born Killers\\" or \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" for being too weird.  They just don't understand.  You don't need to be under the influence to understand \\"Frances the Mute.\\"  You just need to understand that some really classic bands out there wrote some really good albums while seeeeeeeriously high.  This is one of them.
B0009OPO0S|1.0|This is the worst Shakira album dissapointed totaly the only good track La tortura
B000002KIE|3.0|Yes, you read right, I think it's overrated. But in my review I want to mention exactly what I think is so overrated about it.    The first thing to mention is that yes I know it's the only album that the band has ever released. This was an influence on several punks such as Nirvana (plus tons of underground bands who \\"never sold out\\") and was probably the most punk of the bands in the era. However, does that mean that they were the best? No way. I see the Clash's first album as a much better example of what the band was attempting, which is similar to this. I hate to sound intellectual but to me a five-star album is one that not only is just important but keeps you listening all the time. Some of the songs on \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" are quite memorable and all, but the songs are just not the classics they are written to be as. It's true that Johnny's voice is really whiny and they weren't talented, but since they all sounded like they were in the same record this album became listenable. Songs like \\"Pretty Vacant\\" are a lot of fun to listen to and I like the controversial issues like on \\"Bodies\\", but I also don't really care about how angry it's supposed to be. I just care about what the songs are. An especially overrated song is \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\", which while clearly in politics with punk doesn't have much more in it than its cool intro.    I guess it's also that the band was in fact an image more than anything, earlier in the mentioning of how Glen Matlock, the talented member, didn't fit that particular image and later got kicked out of the band. His are most of those that I mentioned that were good. I'll admit that this is wonderful compared to most screamo and pop-punk, yet what does that really say?    I guess it's three stars because the album is put out as being better than it is. If you're a punk then go for it I guess, otherwise just go by whatever. I don't even mind that it isn't very hard to make the songs; that is what punk was invented for. Butthere's quite a bit of songs that I don't consider worth the listen and therefore would recommend many other things in the era.
B00030590I|2.0|Why, oh why do I continue to subject myself to Chinese import movies.  Here's what I mean, I didn't want to see \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", it just didn't appear to be that interesting to me, yet critics applauded the film for its intense action and drama, so like a brainwashed moron I watched the film, and go figure I hated it.  Apparently I didn't learn my lesson though, since I was convinced yet again by critics and by a couple of friends this time, to see the Quentin Tarentino produced, Jet Li epic \\"Hero\\".  This movie with subtitles or dubbed, either way has incredibly boring and wooden dialogue, and the action sequences, while awesome lack the realism that I was hoping for to some extent.  I'm ok with over-the-top action, that is unrealistic to an extent, but the action in this movie was just like that in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", impressive but unrealistic.  The difference between the action scenes in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"Hero\\", is that in \\"Hero\\" the wirework used to create the action is quite obvious because some of the flying appears to be wobbly and clunky.  Well, that's enough complaints for now, let's get on with the story description for \\"Hero\\" and then I'll give a final breakdown to finish things off. <br /> <br />\\"Hero\\" is a movie that apparently was made in China a few years before it's release here in the states, because when the movie was in theaters the Chinese import-DVD was at several retailers.  The story of \\"Hero\\" is set before China became one country, when the different regions of China were divided up into warring provinces.  The ruler of the Qin province has a plan to unite all of the warring provinces together to form one nation.  However, some of the other provinces do not want this to occur for fear of being oppressed under the ruler of Qin or anyone else that may not have their province's best interests in mind.  To thwart the unification from occurring, several highly paid and trained assassins are sent to eliminate the ruler of Qin, and anyone else who gets in their way.  After cutting down one soldier and/or bodyguard after another, the assassins are getting closer and closer to achieving their goal, that is until they encounter a local prefect (Jet Li) of one of the villages of Qin.  This prefect, though only one man, single handedly eliminated all of the assassins and now serves to protect the ruler of Qin at all costs. <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, I knew I would probably not enjoy this movie too much, but I thought surely my friends would not lead me astray (I didn't have the same faith in the movie critics), sadly my faith was misplaced.  Though the movie had potential, in my mind, it quickly squandered it, leaving us with a story that defies belief (even more than \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"), I mean one man taking on entire armies, give me a break.  The acting and dialogue seemed wooden, and truthfully the parts of the story that are purely drama are incredibly boring and really don't propel the movie forward at all, they are only there to fill space between overblown fight scenes.  The special effects and wirework were impressive in some scenes while others weren't as good.  \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" contained better special effects and wirework than this film.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie, unless you absolutely loved \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" or are a fan of Jet Li, then you might enjoy this film.  Otherwise I suggest avoiding this movie and seeing a much better Jet Li movie, \\"Unleashed\\". <br /> <br />\\"Hero\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and minor sensuality.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|I am a sales rep working in the music industry and I have to say that Bond is without a doubt a very interesting new group. The music is absolutely \\"explosive\\" with a great twist to classical. I cant keep it on the shelf because of the enormous popularity. Anyone who has not experienced this please go out and get it, you will be satisfied!!!!! KW
B0009MDPYM|3.0|While I wouldn't use \\"Constantine\\" as a source for any studies on Catholicism(or Christianity as a whole), I will admit that it is a decent flick to watch when there's a little time to kill.  I'm not familiar with the comics that this film is supposed to be based on, so I'll look at it as a stand-alone entity.<br /><br />The story plods along at a snails pace, but the special effects are pretty good, especially the visions of Hell.  The opening exorcism is one of the best parts of the film.  Although Keanu Reeves catches a lot of grief over his performance in this flick, I think that his acting skills were perfect for this particular story.  Rachel Weisz is also very good in this film.  She tackles a briefly dual role as psychic sisters.  Her character's supposedly Catholic beliefs come into question when she mentions that she doesn't believe in Satan.  That's almost like saying you're a Catholic and you're pro-abortion.  That's two things that just don't go together.<br /><br />The Catholicism in this story is treated very lightly.  It's almost as if they just used Christianity as a cool looking backdrop for Constantine to eradicate things in.  The Crucifix-looking gun was rather silly looking, but Constantine did have some other nice weapons in his arsenal.<br /><br />Once again, a well-known angel plays the fall guy and much like in films like \\"The Prophecy,\\" everything boils down to the baddie-supreme:  Satan(a.k.a. Lucifer, Beelzebub, the Devil, Angel of Light, etc.).<br /><br />While I won't say that everyone will enjoy this film, I'm sure fans of modest action flicks will enjoy this.  Some Catholics will probably be turned off by the sacrilege and the ability of Satan to do certain things in the film.  However, if you take this flick for what it is worth, which is a popcorn-ish adult action/horror yarn, you'll be sure to enjoy it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Only Josh Wedon could create a musical from a scifi/horror show. With lines like \\"When I get so worn and wrinkly that I look like David Brinkley.\\" How can you not like this album. I was a little skeptical that Wedon could pull this off but he does brilliantly.  <br /> <br />Probably the best song is Under Your Spell. Amber Benson's voice is incredible. Anthony Stewart Head is another stand out in his numbers. But singing is not new to him. He was in the Rocky Horror Picture Show in England. <br /> <br />What I find great about the album is that each of the songs fits the personality of the character singing it. Also like all Broadway shows the songs advance the story instead of just standing on their own. <br /> <br />Listening to the albums makes me realize how much I miss Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD; it's great fun.
0399103422|5.0|The Godfather was one of the best books I've ever read. In fact I don't read much, but this book's awsome.  It is very descriptive, more than the moviea, and has some parts of the story untold in the movies.  The greatest book!
B00009W0WM|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. It's impact on our culture has been tremendous. Just take a look at AFI's list of all time great films. It's number 2. Or the other lists like movies quotes or movie songs. <br /> <br />The movie is first rate and gripping. No matter how many times I see it the film sweeps me up in its story. And I still laugh out loud in the scene at Rick's Cafe when Claude Rains blows his whistle and says \\"I'm shocked shocked to find that there is gambling here.\\" A moment later he's handed his winnings. I could go on with other favorite moments: the flash back scenes in Paris, the desperate attempt by Victor to obtain the letters of transit while outsmarting the Nazis. Needless to say each scene in the movie is a gem.  <br /> <br />But I think the story had a deeper meaning. Like A Watch on the Rhine, Casablanca makes the case that America can no longer sit on the sidelines while all hell is breaking out in the rest of the world. And like Rick, America must make up its mind which side to support. <br /> <br />Having said all that, it also is one damn good love story. <br /> <br />As to the DVD itself, it is first rate. The restoration is incredible. If I didn't know the movie was over 60 years old, I'd swear it was done recently and the producers decided to film in black and white for effect. That's how good the quality of the film is. There are hours of extras: a couple of commentaries on the movie itself, two documentaries both narrated by Lauren Bacall, and best of all a radio broadcast with the three major stars reprising their roles.  <br /> <br />So instead of spending ten dollars a piece on going out to the movies and seeing a piece of junk, go to your local drug store get some microwave popcorn and snowcaps and pop in the Casablanca DVD and see and experience what a real movie should be. Trust me you won't be sorry.
B0000630YA|5.0|I was a little kid and up late one night when the \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" TV special aired. The music videos for the creepy music on this album enthralled me, and scared the living sh*t out of me. Thirty years later, I still listen to this album frequently. The final act featuring the insane, diabolical Steven still scares me, and Cold Ethyl remains my all-time favorite song about necrophilia. ;-) Welcome to my Nightmare is twisted, evil, maniacal genius.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|I bought this cd the day it was released so I could listen to it on a long drive.  My first thoughts were pleasant and \\"listenable\\" but nothing special.  So at first I was dissappointed.  However a few months have now passed and it continues to surprise me how the songs have etched themselves in my mind and .............how good they really are.  I was trialling some new HiFi the other day and used the CD as tester - the guy in the store said the same thing ....   So I must be right!!!  So for all of you who dismissed it to start with.  Get it out again have another listen and another and you may grow to recognise that this is not an instant classic  - but something much better.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This CD is worth the GOLD, check out songs like Tunnel of<br /><br />Love, Skateaway, & Solid Rock. Les Boys is actully the best album<br /><br />closer of all time!!!! GOLD MEDAL.
B000003TAR|5.0|The simplicity of Nevermind (Nirvanas 2nd studio album) compared to In-Uteros lyrical depth and hidden meanings is amazing.<br /><br />In-Utero is Kurts attempt to capture true raw emotion and he succeded.I'll break this review down into songs.Im trying to rate this for a casual listener (i would give all these songs 5 )<br /><br />1.Serve the Servents-This songs sounds nothing like anything you herd from past Nirvana songs as does this album.It starts off heavy right away.The chorus is the root of the song.This song has a couple different meanings.4/5<br /><br />2.Scentless Apprentice-This is more then likley the worst song on this album to casual listeners.The song is heavy and hard to comprehend Kurts singing.Though hardcore Nirvana fans can compare this to rare heavy Nirvana songs and exept this.2/5<br /><br />3.Heart-Shaped Box-This is truely a piece of art.Easily the best Nirvana song to casual listeners.Very unique and Kurt does a<br /><br />very nice job on the vocals this song. He starts off calm and progresses to a raspy louder sound then fades back to soft.5/5<br /><br />4.Rape Me-If any one listens to this song they'll notice a Smells Like Teen spirit aproach in the opening of the song similar tune.Most people who listen to this song think its about rapeing someone.Though it's an anti rape song Kurt mentions to interviewers.This song is another awsome song . Short but catchy.5/5<br /><br />5.Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle-Long title and a fairly long song by Nirvanas standards.This song starts off almost silent till the guitar picks up.This song has some puposley noticeable feedback from the guitar. The bass line is good ,but hard to hear at times.4/5<br /><br />6.Dumb-Considerablly the sofest song on this album with the exeption of All Apologies.Another short song.A casual listener will immediatly pick up tyhis song and replay over and over and over.The song seems optimistic \\"I'm not like them but i can pretend the sun is gone but i have a light\\" Kurt sounds really bummed out in this song .5/5<br /><br />7.Very Ape-Most will listen to this and Tourette's half way through and dislike this song.Try to listen to these short songs atleast all the way through just once before you judge.This sound features the least Nirvana like sounding guitar riff.4/5<br /><br />8.Milk It-A kinda out of it song in the beggining ,but many like this song right away as it starts out dreery and then goes heavy like many Nirvana songs and this songs vocal have a strong resemblence to Scentless Apprentice.4/5<br /><br />9.Pennyroyal Tea-Another must listen to song.Dave Grohl can be herd in this song if you listen real close.This was released as a single but sadly Kurt committed suicide and the Pennyroyal Tea single was called back.SO IF YOU HAVE IT YOU ARE A LUCKY B@ST@RD!<br /><br />This song is about Kurts stomach pains and the stuff he uses to calm it.5/5<br /><br />10.Radio Friendly Unit Shifter-This song starts out as just noise with feedback like track 5.Kurt sings this song in a low tone and goes kinda fast.\\"What is wrong with me\\" This is another fairly long song from Nirvana 4:51.3/5<br /><br />11.Tourettes-This song sounds like it was sung by someone with Tourettes.Fast uncomprehendable words but a very cool guitar riff.The live Muddy Banks of Whiska version in my opinion is better though i love this song it will easily become a hated by casual listeners as they'll thibnk a retard is singing (no offense Kurt).This song is only 1:35 and was originally entitled<br /><br />The Eagle Has Landed as a joke.2/5<br /><br />12.All Apologies-Very sad \\"Whats else should i be? All apologies\\"<br /><br />For the listeners before Kurt died this had a completley different output at first.After Kurt died this song has a whole different meaning.\\"Everything is my fault ill take all the blame\\" with soft haunting tones like that you'll finnally understand one thing if you already haven't from this cd Kurt was a one of a kind song writter.Any casual listener can't go wrong with this song.It sounds like Kurts trying to say sorry for something. 5/5<br /><br />This review did not go in depth into the songs as i would be here for atleast another hour or two.Just please take the time to pick up this priceless depressing anger riddled<br /><br />cd.Take the time and soak up all that Kurt has to offer in this artistic cd and you'll like it alot more .r.Any casual listener can't go wrong with this song.It sounds like Kurts trying to say sorry for something. 5/5 <br /> <br />This review did not go in depth into the songs as i would be here for atleast another hour or two.Just please take the time to pick up this priceless depressing anger riddled  <br />cd.Take the time and soak up all that Kurt has to offer in this artistic cd and you'll like it alot more .

B00018TI5E|2.0|John Frusciante is best known for his ability to create touching peices of music using the guitar.  This album is nothing but pop crap with corny lyrics and dull strumming backed by electronice beeps and bops.  Two OK songs: \\"Carvel\\" and \\"Song To Sing When I'm Lonely\\".  To hear John at his best pick up the album TO RECORD ONLY WATER FOR TEN DAYS.  Almost every song on that album is truely genius (see \\"Rampart\\" and \\"Murderers\\").  To Record Water For Only Ten Days is so good that when people heard Shadows they made themselves believe it is good even though it is not.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Based on the long running Hellblazer comic series from DC/Vertigo, Constantine is an underrated big budget smash.  Keanu Reeves, of all people, is cast as John Constantine: a man caught between Heaven and Hell.  Coming to the assistance of a detective (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister committed suicide, Constantine faces off against half-breed demons and angels, embroiled in a plot to bring Hell to Earth.  Pseudo-catholic mythology aside, the film for the most part has an intriguing story, and the CGI effects are top notch.  Reeves is fine as an american accented John Constantine, while Weisz gives the best performance of the film.  Tilda Swinton is a nice touch as the asexual Gabriel, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale provides a few chuckles as a slimy demon, and Peter Stormare makes a great Lucifer.  As a whole, Constantine is a great mainstream thriller, even though it is a bit drawn out, and at times, a bit hokey.  With all the negative reviews that Constantine has garnered since it's initial release (from reviewers and comic fans alike), it's terribly underrated for what it really is.  Yes, John's not english or blonde (Sean Bean, who has been in everything from the first Lord of the Rings film to Troy, would have been an excellent choice had the film been more faithful to it's source material), but it's still better than many of the recent comic to film adaptations to be released as of late.  The 2-disc Deluxe Edition DVD features some nice extras, including a horde of deleted scenes, and featurettes on the origin of the character.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Austin powers is Mike Myers at his funniest doing what he loves through more then one character! He takes his great talents and uses them to create the Extremely funny Dr.Evil, Fat bastard, gold member And the star Austin Powers. This Movie is a comedy classic and chances are if you've seen it at all you've seen it more then once; and you just cant get enough. I do believe that this is the best out of the  whole series, its the kinda movie that makes you laugh ever scene to a point where your almost catching your breath at the end. even If you've seen the movie many times you should buy this DVD. infifilms makes the best DVDs.. i could not believe the amount of special features on this disc. Extremely funny out takes, alternative scenes, commentary (that doesn't suck), music videos This DVD gives a whole new look at the movie and if you've seen it and you like it you should definitely buy this DVD. all said this is a 5 star comedy great and is a must for all DVD/VHS collections
B000A59PMO|5.0|I was not very interested in this show even after learning about all the hype about how good it was so decided to tune in. And i am so glad i did! This show is not afraid to push boundries with plots and is more than Nancy Drew, it has comedy, drama and suspense mixed in with high school. The extragavant plots are that are amazingly written make this show work so well. And the perfect choice for the lead was Kristen Bell who gives 110%. Other characters are: Wallace the other outsider friend of veronica played by Percy Doggs 3. Francis Capra plays the lead of Neptunes biker gang who often does favors for veronica. Enrico Cantionli plays Keith Mars the private eye dad wroking alongside veronica. Jason Dohring plays Logan Echolls the jackass of the school who dated Lilly Kane before she was murdered. Lilly Kane is played by Amanda Seyfried the murder victim/ best friend of veronica which she spends a whole season tryin to find out who it.(ITS A SHOCKER!) and Teddy Dunn plays Duncan Kane ex-boyfriend of veronica, Lilly's sister.
B00000I07P|1.0|I used to think Korn was the destroyer of metal, boy was I wrong...after hearing this I knew it was Bon Jovi. I really think that this is the worst music of the 80's, even worse than Modanna or Paula Abdul. Even hairmetal fans dont like this! Hairmetal fans listen to Twisted Sister and Skid Row, and avoid pop like this, White Snake, Poison, Warrant, and Europe. This bad joke here made it so other pansies like Cinderella had a chance to make it, when all they were were talentless hacks who ripped off Van Halens 1984. I couldn't imagine anyone listening to this without having their ears bleed, this makes disco look like Led Zeppelin! Well, at least its better than Good Charlotte and Linkin Park (although not by much).    Anyone who hates Jon Bon Blowme and Bad Joke is commendable, because they (Socialist Metal Head, Cotton Hell for example) are smart enough to realize how p**sified this is. I feel bad for anyone who doesn't see through Bad Jokes haze.    DIE JON BON BLOWME!
0316776963|5.0|This book is extremely funny.  It is easy to read in short intervals because it is composed of stories that can stand on their own.  The treatment of his experiences while learning French allows the reader to see that although cultures can seem different we all share a great deal in the realm of human nature. Sedaris really sees the irony in life.  He presents even sad and twisted subjects in a humorous manner.  I am reading all his books this summer.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is a love it or hate it type of movie - which you will. The point is that is a good movie because people are passionate about it - they passionately love it, or passionately hate it. I fall into the first category while my wife falls into the second. <br /> <br />When I initially watched this film, I had heard my brother in law quote it many times and rave about the movie. I sat through the whole thing and rarely laughed out loud. I just kept thinking, \\"Why am I watching this\\". Now some people (like my wife) would stand up and find something better to do, but once I start a movie I really like to finish it. Even when it was over I was still thinking, \\"Why did I watch that?\\" <br /> <br />Then about a week later it happened. I couldn't help but laugh as scenes from the show started returning to my mind. I had to see it again! ... and again & again & again. It gets funnier every time I see it and you notice the little things that crack you up more after your fifth or sixth viewing - much like Dumb & Dumber. <br /> <br />Warning: this may happen to you if you see this movie!
B00025ETIW|4.0|Had I not heard a huge buzz about My Chemical Romance's THREE CHEERS FOR SWEET REVENGE through music magazines and airplay of their second single, \\"HELENA\\", I probably wouldn't have given a second thought to purchasing this masterwork.  My Chemical Romance does something comparable to Green Day's rock opera, AMERICAN IDIOT--where Green Day made a political album about the condition of the U.S.A. and president Bush, MCR made a concept album about and containing themality concerning death.  Essentially, MCR is a combination of the emo/punk power of groups such as Weezer, Blink-182, Simple Plan, and etc... mixed with the ambitiousness of groups such as The Mars Volta and System of A Down.<br /><br />While death is certainly not my cup of tea when it comes to listening to and evaluating music, it made a very successful album here. While THREE CHEERS FOR SWEET REVENGE is under 40 minutes (39:44 to be exact), it is a positive length because the album has no filler material, which often plagues even the best of albums and artists.<br /><br />This album has few flaws, and most of the flaws aren't a big deal. On occasion, variation in key is somewhat of an issue; if you're a musician, you notice that My Chemical Romance drabbles a lot in d minor. While that key may be overused to an extent, as a band, MCR does sound good and polished in whatever key they choose play in.  Also, for musician's purposes only, you are happy when MCR chooses to change up the chord progressions and the consistent form of minor verse to major chorus throughout the album.  It isn't a big deal at all, but it is something that you notice.  A lot of songwriters have trouble trying not to write mearly chord progressions.  It is a hard feat to conquer from my own experience.<br /><br />Positive things about THREE CHEERS... is that Way has such nice gritty vocals that make you feel what the group is trying to convey to you.  Sometimes, even if you don't understand the depth behind the lyrics, the enthralling nature and emotion of Gerald Way's vocals suffices.  Also, no one can deny the emotion and dynamics of the driving guitar riffs and the background vocals themselves.  Here is my evaluation of each song:<br /><br />1. Helena-  my very favorite song from the album, this tune is both dark and beautiful at the same time.  It starts out with a whispered, mysterious, foreboding introduction by Way that breaks into the lead verse which is minoresque and dark with chilling background vocals at the bridge. Then the chorus ascends to major (bright).  A masterwork in itself, this is easily 5+/5.<br /><br />2.  Give 'Em Hell, Kid - embodies the typical elements of punk/emo with busy, heavy-driven guitar riffs.  Vocals once again are strong and the form remains the same as HELENA, though it isn't as exciting or moving as HELENA.  4/5<br /><br />3. To The End- another solid track that is more accessible and commercial than GIVE 'EM HELL KID, which is good in the sense that it is more commercial, but bad in the sense that it isn't as unique as say HELENA. 4/5<br /><br />4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison- once again excellent, gritty vocals by Way (which make the microphone crack in the recording), nice change of texture from a guitar-spare verse to a guitar \\"heroics\\" chorus.  The form is again minor to major. 3.5/5<br /><br />5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise)- is easily the second (and maybe even first) best track on the album.  The guitars are driving, there are nice interludes after the main verse, chorus, etc.., you feel \\"emo\\" in its best here.  5/5<br /><br />6.  The Ghost of You- this track gets my lowest marks for the entire album.  It is still a good track, but for me, it doesn't have the same oomph as better tracks on this album. 3/5<br /><br />7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You- nice chords and nice rhythmic feel especially at the chorus.  The driving guitars are once again a plus and Gerald Way stretches vocal limits adding just a touch of falsetto to the mix.  4/5<br /><br />8. Interlude- NO SCORE<br /><br />9. Thank You For The Venom- another top track for me from this album.  The same commentary basically for my highest scoring tracks. 4.5/5<br /><br />10.  Hang 'Em High- Nice guitar arrangements, slightly busy, but amazing. 4.5/5<br /><br />11.  It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A Deathwish- again, another angst driven track with driving guitars, with excellent chord changes, yet in some respects it sounds too similar to better tracks on this album. Still a good track. 3.5/5<br /><br />12. Cemetery Drive- good deceptive chords, yet this track doesn't compare to HELENA or I'M NOT OKAY.  3/5<br /><br />13.  I Never Told You What I Do For A Living- a very nice ending to this album. Gerald has a nice clarity to his voice here and there are just beautifully used chords here.  Another one of my favorite tracks. 4.5/5<br /><br />Overall, the scores of the songs average out to a little bit more than 4 stars.  This is a 4 star album and I hope that young bands like MCR keep pumping out more and more innovations. This album itself is a rock masterpiece. Highly recommended. 4/5.touch of falsetto to the mix.  4/5 <br /> <br />8. Interlude- NO SCORE <br /> <br />9. Thank You For The Venom- another top track for me from this album.

B0006L16N8|5.0|With the astronomical success of their sophomore record \\"A Rush of Blood To the Head,\\" Coldplay has outdone themselves with their third release, \\"X&Y\\". <br />Chris Martin, singer, keyboardist, songwriter, married actress Gwyneth Paltrow and welcomed daughter Apple into the world in 2004. It seemed as if music was put on the backburner with his new roles as a husband and father. However, Martin and his mates wrote an amazing record which could potentially surpass the success of their previous record. <br />Opening with the powerful, \\"Square One\\", \\"X&Y\\" electrifies it's listeners with passionate, heart-felt lyrics of starting over and Martin proclaiming that everyone is the same no matter what their status might be. <br />\\"What If?\\" could be the next potential single from the record if it's not, \\"Fix You\\" which the band collectively dubbed \\"the best song they've ever written,\\" when they introduced the record live on MTV. <br />\\"What If?\\" has answered the question many ask themselves during a relationship. \\"What if I got it wrong, and no poem or song, could put right, what I got wrong, or make you feel I belong...\\" Martin sings, proclaiming a confessional for anyone involved in a relationship that is heading south. With the very catchy refrain this is a definite sing-a-long. <br />\\"Fix You,\\" is by far the greatest Coldplay song ever written. Martin's lyrics careen through the soul and make one debate what the problem is with their lives and relationships. The band considered this song as \\"Clocks Part II\\" due to the description of relationship struggles and musical similarities. Martin struggles to think about a missed chance at a perfect sitation in \\"Fix You\\" with the tear jerking line, \\"When you try your best but you don't succeed,\\" that line could relate to just about anyone who has ever struggled with taking advantage of opportunities. <br />\\"Speed Of Sound\\", the first single from \\"X&Y\\", is very reminiscent of a U2 song with it's echoing guitars and Martin's scratchy vocals.   <br />\\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" and \\"A Message\\" are the true love songs on the record, with Martin chiming in on wanting his significant other by his side. <br />Really, there are no low points to this record. The record is a rollercoaster ride of emotional movement from start to finish. From up-beat catchy riffs to the heartfelt mellowness, \\"X&Y\\" is Coldplay's first complete record, that accomplishes every goal fans need. A record that you can listen to, cover to cover, without  skipping through to the next song. <br />And, as if having 12 perfect songs wasn't enough, \\"X&Y\\" uncovers a hidden gem from the Coldplay catalog. \\"'Til Kingdom Comes,\\" a song the band wrote for Johnny Cash is a bonus track on the record. The song was written for Cash to use on his last record, which he never completed due to his death, so the band decided to put this on the record, paying homage to the musical icon. <br />\\"X&Y\\" does however lay to rest those nasty rumors of comparisons to U2 and Radiohead, with their very own introspective lyrics and unique sound. Coldplay makes a name for themselves amongst top acts. With the mercury still rising from the heating of Coldplay's popularity, \\"X&Y\\" should be up at the top of the best albums of the year, and maybe the best albums ever.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|my god i loved this film! damien rice's incredible song sets the scene, we are in for some lovin' and some serious hurt. but isn't that what love really is? this isn't your growin' old and raisin' puppies love. it is gritty, hurtful, fleetingly (but miraculously) joyous, violent and erotic. it is who we are- animals behaving as we do. while there is hope, it is given out in realistically small aliquots, not splattered about in a typical manner. when we love we get hurt, and ow, does this film beautifully project this conundrum.    natalie portman is absolutely amazing in everyway, an incredble performance. the other cast are also great, but natalie, especially natalie, is just such an absorbing experience it makes all the rest just drift away. i will never forget the fleeting beauty of the pure, real love that this film captures, just for a moment, which is all one can ever hope for.
0671027344|5.0|I must first mention that I am a student, and I do not like to read at all. I have a hard time getting into books. I have a hard to time choosing books. I cannot even look at a long books. I am also a metalhead. It is hard to keep my attention on anything that is not related to heavy metal. This book opened my eyes. It is a perfect view of what life is like in the first year of highschool. It is a great book to read if you are anxious about highschool, anxious about social problems, or just want to have a great book to read. This book deals with common teenage problems including relationships and drugs. That is why it is a good book for middleschool to highschool students. Charlie grabs the reader and pulls them into his world as a \\"wallflower.\\" The reader is automatically hooked to Charlie's problem-matic world. It is a \\"cannot put down book.\\" And those are words coming from someone who hates to read. I read this book within two weeks, which is really good for me. Now, I can probably read a book of its length and interest in less than a two weeks. I definetly recommend this book because if I can read it and like it, anyone can.
B00008438V|4.0|John Hughes and a likable, enthusiastic cast walk perfectly on a tightrope between funny and silly in this film that is still marketed as \\"silly teenage fantasy-comedy\\" but, to its credit, is really much more.<br /><br />As a former male teenager I can tell you that lots of males spend lots of time thinking about things that:<br />1. No one else thinks of and,<br />2. Would NEVER come true<br /><br />But they think about these things anyway.  To some degree the ability to measure how \\"grown up\\" a man has become is to discover how much he's given up these immature fantasies.  In most men they never go away entirely, although I should say that most of the men I know who are \\"no fun\\" are the ones who have completely left behind their silly teenaged self.<br /><br />Anthony Michael Hall is featured as Gary and Ilan Mitchell-Smith plays Wyatt.  (Bill Paxton is a scream as Wyatt's military-academy mental brother Chet.) Gary and Wyatt are geeky early high-school wimps (often featured in Hughes movies, who dream of hot cars, hot babes, popularity and their own place in the spotlight.<br /><br />In the fantasy world of this movie they use a computer with tons of input and connections to create \\"Lisa\\", played by Kelly LeBrock.  Lisa is not only willing to shower with Gary and Wyatt (in a very asexual and minimally nude scene), but is essentially a \\"magic genie\\", able to grant multiple wishes to Gary and Wyatt. They get hot cars, they throw killer parties, other cute teenaged girls get interested in them.  When militaristic Chet finds wild goings-on at the house (while Mom and Dad are conveniently away, of course) he initially blows a gasket.  Lisa uses her magic powers over and over.  When Grandma and Grandpa come over to visit Lisa \\"freezes\\" them like statues and they get stowed in a closet.  Chet finds Grandma and Grandpa in that condition and screams at Wyatt \\"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DISRESPECTFUL THAT IS?!\\"  Lisa turns Chet into a disgusting blubbery mass with few recognizable features except for the still-intact military crewcut on top of his head.  The Chet-mass burps and farts and is generally disgustingly hilarious for the kind of folks who think those kinds of things are hilarious.<br /><br />This is not a movie for someone looking for a serious movie.  Nor is it for someone looking for \\"realism\\".  It's silly in a very good-hearted way.  If you ever wanted to see teenaged boys get their every wish coming true - this if the film you've been waiting for.act military crewcut on top of his head.

0385513755|5.0|It's not often you find a novel that is rich in history, fast paced and steeped in spirituality--particularly the feminine side of it.  This is the story of the power of the Goddess that once was once revered and respected, and how that power was taken away thousands of years ago by those seeking to control the masses.  Thus creating 2000 years of patriarchal rule of all world governments and religions.  It is a reminder for all of us that the time has come to bring back the power of the divine feminine and all that she stands for.  It is a time to swing the pendullum at least back to the middle where both men and women are equal.  I would also recommend reading \\"The Goddess of Happiness\\" to fully embrace the power of the goddess.

B0007TKNII|3.0|I would have given this DVD only 2 stars for the lack of extras apart from the trailer, and also for the fact that Gerard Butler's singing is....well, let's just say that he croaks melodically, but there were two saving graces that made this film somewhat enjoyable for me:<br /><br />1) Minnie Driver as Carlotta.  Carlotta seems to be a somewhat over-the-top character, and Ms. Driver plays the role to perfection, with all the mannerisms and things one would expect from a demanding diva.<br /><br />2) Emmy Rossum as Christine.  The time this young woman spent in the Metropolitan Opera's youth program paid off.  Her singing as Christine was exquisite, so much so that I found myself looking forward to the numbers where she sang solo, since Butler, while not bad, failed to measure up in the numbers he sang with her.<br /><br />All in all, it could have been better, but this film did have its moments, which is why I didn't give it the lower rating.  Gerard Butler could use some lessons at the Met himself, though.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|The FF would have earned a 5 from me if the tracks were all mixed in together instead of being seperated entirely into seperated discs. While both discs are excellent they don't feel like they belong together because they are so vastly different thus creating a feeling of vast seperation almost like different worlds. I dunno maybe that's the feeling they were going for but for me I would've liked them blended together to create more of a flow. However I love them both and will listen to them for a long time. Disc one is balls out rock n' roll and disc two takes us on the perfect journey to a softer side of the Foo. You will not be let down. Enjoy.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Bland, overproduce and underwritten horror movie that is as scary as a Bart Simpson costume. Keanu Reeves is miscast as the lead character, giving an under whelming performance that makes some of the other lackluster acting from the other actors in the movie look professional. Shia LaBeouf once again annoys in a supporting role that almost torpedoes the film and Tilda Swinton overacts in ways that makes her performance almost as bad as Keanu's and she's able to do that with only two scenes in the movie. Her monologue is so bad in the last act that it had most of the people laughing in my movie theater. The only two actors in the entire movie who manages to give good performances in this film and stand out in this hug pile of crap is Rachel Weisz, who gives too much grace and talent to this film and to her role and Peter Stormare, whose eight minute cameo does more  for the movie as a whole than Keanu does with his entire role. For Weisz and Stormare, I give this movie one star. For Keanu and the rest, a negative 0.
B0009NZ3BO|4.0|If your interested in this album, it's probably not news that this remastering job was botched.  It's been officially acknowledged as mentioned in other reviews.   <br /> <br />Having known and loved this album for a long time, I have to report that I'm keeping my botched remastered copy.  There are so many layers to this album, listening to this version exposes aspects of the songs I've not heard before.  Yes, once the fixed remaster of Interview comes out, I'll be buying that one, too, but I really enjoy listening to this pressing.   <br /> <br />In fact, my wife has had to tolerate my interest in Gentle Giant, and while we were listening to this very pressing of this album in the car, she actually said she enjoyed it.  <br /> <br />I, too, was disappointed that this wasn't the clean representation of this album that I expected.  However, if you've known and loved these songs for a long time like I have, you may also appreciate hearing this and having it in your collection.   <br />
B0000VCZKW|4.0|Our family loves the book, and most of our family liked this DVD pretty well too.  I personally thought it was OK, but a bit lacking in the characterization of Matilda.  In the book, Matilda is an introverted, sensitive kid who eventually develops the ability to move small objects, but it takes a lot of her energy to use it and she's usually exhausted afterwards.  In the movie, Matilda is more of a typical \\"cute Hollywood kid\\" (not shy at all) who can move very large objects (and/or large numbers of objects) pretty much anytime without any difficulty or fatigue -- much like Samantha in \\"Bewitched\\".  Oh well, that's Hollywood for you. <br /> <br />Still, the movie is mostly enjoyable.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it's probably too \\"dark\\" for kids under 7 -- the amount of meanness exhibited by some adults might upset them.   <br /> <br />The DVD extras are well-done, and my kids enjoyed the games.

More so than for almost any other musician, it has always almost seemed that he was doing a duet with his guitar, and often times the guitar tells as much of the story of the song as do the lyrics. But, sadly, that is for the most part missing from this album. Many of the songs on this album are \\"nice,\\" but (except for a few short passages) I get the sense that he is holding back with the lead guitar, and it is relegated to the supporting role of providing melody rather than the prominence of his most-loved songs. I just kept waiting for him to break out with his well-known guitar solos on so many songs, but they just did not come, and the listener is left feeling that something was missing. And without that lead guitar taking off, these are just a bunch of regular old songs without anything much special.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Michael Mann's slick \\"Collateral\\" brings two talents into sharp focus. First, Mann's ability to bring the viewer through the camera into the cream of LA nightlife: it's flat surface and glittery light. And second, Tom Cruise's ability to display cold, ruthless intention and an angry darkness. The cinematography is exquisite, and for that alone no serious filmgoer should miss this. Buy it on DVD, but if it shows up in the theater again, don't miss it there if you missed it before.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I have listened to this album 3 times now, and with the exception of \\"What If I Do\\", I can't find a song which rates in the top 20 Foo songs ever.  Disk One:  Dave Screaming a lot <br />Disk Two:  Dave not screaming a lot.  Since \\"You're not the one\\", I haven't recalled a truly good Foo track.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I loved the \\"original\\" - but THIS is spectacular !!  Johnny Depp is hilarious. Sets are stunning.  I plan to see it in the theater again, and will buy the DVD when it comes out.
B0002PUHF6|4.0|This film is based loosely on a H.P.Lovecraft tale. The producer and director, both, went on to be involved in several other Lovecraft projects. Stuart Gordon directed this film, and it was put together and produced by Brian Yuzna. Yuzna became the director of the three sequels. Gordon had a reputation as an avante garde theatrical director in Chicago.<br /><br />Lovecraft created a fictitious great book-the Necronomicon-containing evil workings, horrendous spells, and \\"Dark things best left alone\\". Perhaps this influenced J.K. Rowling a bit as she created the world of Harry Potter. This film-with its outrageous gore, comedy, campness, and nudity-has become a cult favorite-on the par with ROCKY HORROR. It is shown late night in older theatres all over the country.<br /><br />Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West chewed up the scenery-and established a horror persona that has carried over to all the sequels. David Gale, an English actor, played his nemesis-Dr. Carl Hill. After being beheaded-his spirit carried on-carrying his head about like a jack-o-lantern. Bruce Abbott played the hero-Dean Cain-the idealistic med student lead down the path of hubris by West. Barbara Crampion was the girlfriend Megan Halsey-playing a lot of her scenes in the nude. Her Botticellian curves were much more memorable that her acting ability. The most shocking and often remembered scene in the film was the infamous \\"Severed Head Fellatio Party\\". It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />The film's plot was chaos-zombies tearing about-blood spurting like erupting fire hoses-nudity abounding-comic and darkly absurd bursts of dialogue. It becomes a campy remake of Frankenstein-ten times more intense. One critic wrote,\\" It is a very big wet chunk of gore-with a sick sense of humor-and some really gruesome sequences. In short-the perfect date movie.\\"
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side will forever be a great record without a doubt!  Every new generation of teenagers will hear this and be blown away by it's originality as compared to current music.  No band since this has put together such a creative effort and i doubt any band will ever come close....esspecially with the sad direction most popular music has taken.  Also check out \\"Wish you were here\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Meddle\\", & For the newbie \\"Echoes\\"
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|This movie i feel is without a doubt the greatest cinematic accomplishment ever experienced. i never get tired of watching it, all the thoughts that were put forth in this masterpiece opened up a world of ideas and concepts that i think are relevent in the world today. I wish i knew how shirow masamune created the script for this movie, its incredible. greatest movie ever i would give it ten stars if the rating could that high. everyone should see this movie, it will make you evaluate your priorities in life.
B00097A5HW|5.0|If Shakira were to release a CD and put down the guitar, cut off the other music and just sing acapella I would buy it. This woman has an amazing voice. But take that voice, add great music and you have a great CD. My favorites are Dia de Enero, Tortura, Imprescindible, and de la Intuicion. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. My only complaint is I wanted there to be more songs. <br /> <br />Shelley Halima <br />Author of Azucar Moreno and Los Morenos
0394800389|5.0|My kids can't stop giggling every time we read this book together! Good exercise for your tounges.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I must first start by stating that the original movie (though I love Gene Wilder) was completely unrepresontational of the book. It was too blatently creepy. I'm not saying I did not like the movie, it was fairly good for what it was on its own, but it was not the beloved childrens book. <br /> <br />That being said, it is impossible to compaire these two movies as movies, as this Tim Burton version is rather close to the original Dahl story. <br /> <br />Now first, the visuals in the movie are absolutely incredible. So bright and insanely detailed (just as it should be... this is a big point that the original movie was lacking, and that I personally feel only Tim Burton could do right). Every room in the factory also has an entierly different feel to it. One of the only two down-points in this film is the fact that one is left with the feeling that they have not seen enough of the factory (but it is on purpose, because after passing the \\"relatively new\\" \\"burn ward\\" in the glass elavator, one has to wonder, what other rooms could there possibly be?). And of course, there is the rediculous contrast between the generic, perfectly rectangular buildings in the \\"city\\" and Charlie's very Tim Burton-ized, crooked, run down home on the \\"outskirts\\" (all in the middle of winter, mind you). <br /> <br />Next is the soundtrack. If you like Danny Elfman you will love this movie (well, you more rather have to be a big fan of Oingo Boingo as well). It sounds as though Burton told Elfman to just go insane with the music. And that is exaclty what the music is: insane. Throughout the film is this hard hitting, neo-80's (incredibly Danny Elfman) sound that prevailes like no other aspect in this film. I warn you though, if you are not a big fan of Danny Elfman's rediculous and over the top sound, you will not enjoy this movie (I believe this story was intended to have that kind of sound, so if you like the story of the Chocolate Factory, you may like it). You have to go to this film expecting MUSIC. I was at the midnight showing, and after the Augustus Gloop song, I looked around the theater and everyone had these stone cold faces, with only the expression of \\"what in the world am I watching?\\", as I was having a rather difficult time restraining my laughter, so as not to annoy everyone else. <br /> <br />The Cast. It is perfect. There is not a single bad actor or bad choice among them. And Johnny Depp once again amazes me to no end. His character is such an incredibly original take on Willy Wonka that completely makes sense. He very childish, sarcastic (as Wonka must be), and very weak (as a person). He is most certainly not the \\"Ominous figure\\" many see him to be as after Gene Wilder's portrayal. Which both make sense to me. Wilder saw him as this mystical character with other-worldly powers (how else does he know he isn't going to find just five spoiled brats? It seems to be logical that is the only thing you could expect from a contest like that), where Depp sees him as a child (he does run a chocolate factory, and as far as the contest is concerned, he doesn't know what to expect because he doesn't understand society, or the changes society has undergone since he secluded himself, but, as a child would, he judges all of them right from the start, giving him an underly creepy feel). Once again, amazing cast. <br /> <br />And to cap it off, the story is good and solid. Yes, some of the mystery of the book is taken out, and the backstory of Wonka may or may not be liked be some. I like all of the satiric statments about society within this film, though (which I will leave you, the soon-to-be audience member, to find yourself), and some of that comes through the backstory and the lack of mystery (which is the untimate irony). <br /> <br />I stated one of two flaws earlier. The second is the Veruca Salt scene, and what the father does. I understand what Burton was trying to achieve with that, but it just did not translate to film well. Go see themovie, you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />So overall, I understand that many people are not going to like this movie as much as I did, for one reason or another. I just ask you, before you see the film, to go into it without the thoughts of the first film in your head. And don't expect an outwardly creepy and dark Tim Burton movie, because you will be dissapointed. Expect Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|All of our frustrations of the soulless, image candy of summer blockbusters like Godzilla and recent films like Fantastic Four can be directly linked to Jaws. The film drew massive numbers and the lines to see it went past the street corners, hence spawning the name \\"blockbuster\\". However, this is one Hollywood blockbuster that actually doesn't suck. Not only is it a great Spielberg film, but it's a great adventure film period. <br /> <br />A girl who goes skinny dipping(little note: if you look really hard, you can actually see nudity) is found dead and Police Chief Brody wants to shut down the beaches because of a possible shark still lurking around. The town mayor however knows that all their revenue comes from summer tourism so he opts not to shut down the beaches. 3-4 attacks later and he finally relents. So Brody, shark hunter Quint and Oceaniographic Institute scientist Hooper go on Quint's boat to hunt down the troublemaker: a 25 foot long great white shark. <br /> <br />The film was plagued by a disastrous shoot that often times wouldn't get as many shots as Spielberg wanted, some days if any shots. The mechanical shark(nicknamed \\"Bruce\\" after Spielberg's lawyer) sank or would break down. But audiences got freaked then went back and it's the first film ever to surpass the 100 million mark. Sure Spiderman 2 did it in one weekend. But back then, this was quite a milestone. <br /> <br />Oft-quoted lines, memorable images and performances and really good pacing makes this not only a Spielberg classic but a classic in general.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Manson is a show man...And this cd is full of energy, and makes me realized how far can go with his music. I love this cd. My favourites are \\"New model\\" \\"The Dope Show\\" \\"Coma White\\" \\"Rock is dead\\"...Actually all the cd is my favourite. His best work until now.
1573223026|3.0|Nick Hornby is a very talented writer who has a knack for providing insightful commentary on life as a whole.  This novel does not stray from this but it does feel, to me, a bit forced.   <br /> <br />The characters have become cookie cutter versions of themselves who predictably change a bit in the end when they really haven't changed at all.  I was expecting to be taken on a journey and was a tad disappointed when I didn't feel like I'd traveled very far from the first pages.   <br /> <br />For an entertaining and quick read I would recommend it.  The story never lags and it keeps the readers interest. But if you are looking for a piece of literature that adds new introspective on the art of writing then I say you should look elsewhere.
B0000931QR|2.0|I fell asleep whit this cd. I can say \\"Puedes Contar Conmigo\\" \\"Vestido az&uacute;l\\" and \\" Perd&oacute;name\\" are great songs, the rest are...aaahummm...zzzzzzzzzzz.....buy it if you have some troubles with your sleep.
0380789019|5.0|What a great novel. My first adventure into the world of Neil Gaiman, and I was not disappointed. London Below is a truly fascinating place. I really sympathized with Richard Mayhew when I realized Jessica acted a lot like my ex-girlfriend. Anyway, I really became attached to all the characters: Door, Islington, Richard, the marquis de Cabaras, Hunter, etc. Really fascinating book. I'm still waiting for that sequel he's talking about. <br /> <br />This book is a true fantasy classic. I don't read in the genre much, but I've never been disappointed stories with dark realms such as these. If you've read Stephen King's 'Eyes of the Dragon'. This book is along those lines. Five stars. Absolutely no doubt about that.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Sorry, Fans...But even this is maybe my favourite band, i hate this cd. \\"Hey Baby\\" \\"Detective\\" and some others silly songs, are so empty and really bad to me.They wants to be more fun,caribean, and fresh but they don't. Anyway, \\"Platinum blonde Life\\" and \\"Hella Good\\" can be fun. Buy it if you want, but...
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Amazing!!! As reinnovated as the album is, it is simply a fantastic sounding appetizer (which can hold it's own just as good) to the album's second half Hypnotize. Every track is great.By the the most important rock release of the first half of 2005. Radio/Video and Revenga rule!!!
B000001Y79|5.0|\\"Don't Speak\\" was my first song that i learned in English, after that i try to undestand the rest of the \\"TRAGIC KINGDOM\\" cd and as result i love this cd. \\"SpiderWebs\\"\\"Just A Girl\\" \\"Excuse me Mr.\\" \\"Sixteen\\" \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and \\"Different People\\" are amazing. Buy it.
0385474547|5.0|I read this book in my freshmen year of high school and it was the only book that I had to read that year in English class that I actually enjoyed. It's a really easy read and it completely sucked me in. I found myself reading ahead and finishing it way ahead of the class. The book is quite fascinating about life in Nigeria. The book centers around a man named Okonkwo who goes from being a highly respected warior to a murderer and an exhiled man. It shows his descent from a powerful and respected man to a sad and tormented man. It also shows the war between the whites and the blacks. The whites bring their religion to impose on the blacks and there is an awful war between them. The story is sad and tragic and shows a downfall of a man as well as a war and how this man must lead his people into victory.  <br />I agree with another reviewer that this book does bring great class discussions that I enjoyed participating in. So, if you have the opportunity to read this gem in class, then enjoy or else get it on your own to read it.
B00097A5HW|1.0|I think its the worst Shakira album.It has only 1 hit song that is La Tortura.I only like that song.Afer Laundry Service album,she has dissapointed me so much. <br />You don't need to buy this album.It's not a good album like past Shakira albums.
0679720200|5.0|Albert Camus' debut novel is brief, skimpy on plot, and written in the simplest and most direct manner possible, but this is as effective a piece of literature as any because of the brilliant mind behind it.  Camus was a great philisophical and literary mind, and his books were always infused with a profound concern for the desperate, desolate human condition.  The power of such a little volume as \\"The Stranger\\" lies in the very uncomfortable truths that it manages to uncover - truths which reverberate through the reader because of the spare prose that they are presented in.     'The Stranger' is deeply depressing, and for paradoxical reasons: it is depressing because we are able to identify with the protagonist, Monsieur Meursault, and empathize with his misery, even though he is barely capable of emotion and murders a man for no real reason, remaining remorseless to the end.  The story of Meursault's meaningless life and the pointless crime that inevitably leads to his downfall will leave readers distraught because Camus is not simply writing about a sick man; he perceives Meursault's emptiness and nihilism as the mindset of any man who comes to understand the indifference of the rest of the world to his plight, and in turn becomes indifferent to everything he once found pleasurable; a romantic relationship, a good meal, a social outing, a swim in the ocean, and eventually life itself.     What hope is there for Meursault in the last days before his execution?  He knows that there is no afterlife and he has no interest in reliving his experiences in his mind or pondering them, so what will he do with the little time he has left?  Will he count cracks in the walls of his cell for a few hours of the day and sleep for the rest, or will he look for something else?  \\"The Stranger\\" ends inconclusively, allowing us to ponder the question, and leaves us sick to our stomachs at the possibility that Meursault has reached a dead end (and I was literally nauseous at the end of the book).      Camus calls on all of his readers to use what imagination they have to make their lives bearable, and I think that this is what ultimately makes \\"The Stranger\\" so powerful.  It's an important book to read in our high schools as well, especially for a generation of youth that indulges itself in the vacuous entertainments of the television and music worlds that do nothing to improve their minds or characters.  It's not a morality tale, but a provoker of thought; it asks us: how close are we to being Meursault?
0790729342|1.0|Great Movie.  'Nuff Said.  Horrible first-generation DVD.  The menuing system looks like it was done with the sort of throwaway software they give out with DVD-burners.  The audio is horrible - the effects and the music drown out the dialog, so you either have to play it so low you have to watch subtitles for the dialog, or just be blasted by the effects track.  Chapter selection for only every 5 chapters too!  The picture quality looks like VHS.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you are a fan of Joss Whedon's work, or maybe just a Sci-Fi enthusiast, I highly recommend watching Firefly.  A fascinating blend of humor, action, character development and moral dilemmas make each episode a joy to watch.  While its initial run only lasted a single season, the cult following of it gave Joss enough backing to get a movie produced which will be coming out in a few months (called Serenity, look for it!).  If it is reasonably successful in the box office, we may see Firefly return to the small screen again as well.
0385513755|5.0|The special illustrated edition of the Da Vinci Code was a pleasure to read. It was one of the most \\"fun\\" I have ever had reading a novel. The illustrations really added to the story as I am somewhat of a visual person.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is truly a great novel that keeps the reader in suspense from beginning to end. Dan Brown does a terrific job leaving you with just enough info and suspense to make you continually have to go on and read the next chapter. It is a book that most will find hard to put down once they open it up. The illustrated edition makes it even harder to put down as you now no longer need to go to your computer to check out events, icons, places, etc. that are mentioned throughout the novel.<br /><br />While the illustrated edition is rather clunky and heavy to hold - much like a college text book - I do highly recommend this version. Having the 160+ illustrations right in front of you are worth the ungainly size & weight of the book.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Miserable supernatural thriller that makes every mistake known to man in casting Keanu Reeves in a role that he's clearly not fit to do. He makes a fool out of himself with a performance that lacks conviction and lacks presence. He makes the movie a real challenge to watch and add to that problem a director that lacks the know how to stage a scene that has an even flow and a script that is so uneven, and you have a disaster in the making.  Is the movie a true disaster? Almost, and that's because it has a powerful and complex performance by Rachel Weisz that almost makes you forget about the disaster that is happing right in front of you. She is able to make you not only care about what is happing in the film but will make you want to sit though it in order to see what will happen with her story. Unfortunately for her, the script really does nothing to further her character's plight along and you can see that she is clearly trying to stay interested with her part, which is the same frustration you will a have in trying to stay interested in the movie. <br /> <br />To put it all in perspective, Rachel Weisz is the movies only godsend but other than her great effort to bring more to this film than either Keanu or the director try to do, the movie is a disaster from top to bottom.  <br />
B0009OPO0S|4.0|I don't speak a word (OK, maybe one, but not more than a few dozen) of Spanish, and to be quite frank, I've never liked the aesthetic sound of the language.  Shakira's music has really changed that.  Besides her intriguing voice, her music comes across as always beautiful, even when \\"shaken up,\\" and intelligent.  I'm going to have to take language lessons so I can follow along while she sings, but this album, even to a totally foreign ear, transcends pop stereotypes but manages to be completely accessible.  If you think the chanteuse is not for you because you don't speak her language, you're missing out; the language of the music speaks for itself.
1594200106|5.0|I bought this to read on the return trip from Shanghai to the United States.  The plane disappeared as I turned page after page.  Usually on a plane, I read for a while, chat for a while, do a crossword puzzle; not this time.  I read and read and read, and when I got home, I stayed awake in all my jetlagged glory to finish reading. This novel is that good. The buzz on the Amazon page talks about how it compares to other novels, and I agree; it's set firmly in the tradition of Victor Hugo.  Zafon writes with grand sweeps of the imagination as well as a nod to the grotesque, absurd, and fantastical -- I only wish that I could read it for the first time again.  Do not miss this one!
B000002UVX|5.0|I really consider Are You Experienced to be Hendrix' best album. But Band Of Gypsies definitely lets you in on the music, and it focuses on the music, which is a nice restful place to be, if you are tired of hearing Hendrix try to add too much, or if you get tired of hearing the Experience overplaying at times. I just prefer Buddy Miles' heavy backbeat and the space between the notes. Band of Gypsies is a welcome return to the roots of the music.
068987474X|5.0|This is a wonderfully insightful and witty book for someone looking for an easy summer reading experience.  The two authors play off of each other brilliantly and I enjoyed it as a female who sometimes can easily misinterpret the other sex.  The bottom line-it sets a standard that women can understand and that men should follow-even if you don't agree with everything, the guidelines this book presents are fantastic.
1400031362|5.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls is a real treat. I have really gotten attached to this series of books that cherish story telling over action scenes. Smith's work here with his #1 Ladies Detective Agency is not about finding clever ways to solve mysteries. So if you have yet to pick up one of his stories or are wondering why so many people love these books keep that in mind while you read them. Instead of trying to solve the puzzles or sit waiting to be shocked into sitting up biting your nails, watch how Smith pulls together a dozen interesting personal tales and then weaves them together in a magical way. In `Morality...' Smith manages to slip in a few insights into how one might manage to live a proper and upstanding life. He does so by having his characters think of the old Botswana ways or the Ten Commandments and then wonder at what is wrong with modern Botswana men and women. Then he goes about with stories that link into this theme. All in all this is a very deceivingly complex book. It lulls you with its simple approach and if your not careful you might not notice that Smith might be trying to change you, the reader, with his clever insights.<br /><br />So far I think that because of what I said above, this is Smith's best work of the series. I am in awe of his abilities as an author. This is sort of like reading a simple version of Moby Dick with all of its layers of meaning. Don't pass this series up, though I would suggest you start with the first book.<br /><br />Enjoy
0425152251|2.0|After completing Sophie's World, I am left with a profound sense of dissatisfaction and the urge to do the job properly. Jostein Gaarder attempts to present a history of (let's be a little more explicit--WESTERN) philosophy through a fictitious medium surrounded by superficial plot.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it fails as both a work of fiction (stilted, un-engaging plot development, contrived and unoriginal twist, and underdeveloped characters) as well as a history of western philosophy (oversimplified presentation on all philosophers (even for a child), too much time spent rehashing the greeks, and an complete omission of modern philosophy with no mention whatsoever of anglo-american pragmatism, logical positivism, hermeneutics, or post-modernists, to name but a few).  <br /> <br />Where's Fichte, or Schopenhauer(!!), or Peirce, Frege, Hsserl, Marcuse, Russel, Tarski, Wittegenstein(?!!), or Feyerabend, Habermas, Derrida, and Foucault? Heidegger apparently warrants nothing but a passing mention as 'a man who was influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.'! <br /> <br />Gaarder attempts to postulate philosophical progression, then drops the ball entirely after Keirkegaard (oh but of course, he's Scandinavian). His ignorance of 20th century philosophy is inexcusable, and his skills as a novelist could use rather a lot of work as well.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Released in 2001, Driving Rain by Paul McCartney received almost unanimous approval from the critical community. They appreciated the lack of whimsy, what some might call silliness, that imbues so many other McCartney albums, and believed Paul's young band and producer gave the music a welcome bite - they gave it their blessings as the best thing Paul had done in a long while. Interestingly, the fans, the people that truly understand and support Paul's work, are almost evenly split on the matter, calling it either a masterpiece or mediocre. I've got a foot firmly in both camps.    Like many McCartney albums, Driving Rain deals primarily with love, but the tracks can easily be divided into two topics: the loss of a loved one and newfound romance. There are no outright sunny songs on this album, nor does Paul allow himself to wallow in depression: his grief for Linda is tempered by his undying optimism, and his happiness with Heather derives a melancholy from his preceding heartbreak. Had Paul put some major effort into it, this balancing act could have produced an album like few in the McCartney catalogue. But another defining characteristic of Driving Rain is its no-frills, straightforward approach; and though Paul and what would become his touring band are all excellent musicians, many of the arrangements are thin and would have benefited from more polish - especially Macca's usually golden voice.     The same goes for the lyrics, which lack much of the whimsical imagination for which Paul has become famous and too often border on trite or boring. Stylistically, however, it is perhaps his most diverse record since 1979's Back to the Egg. It has its fair share of ingenious McCartney art-pop (e.g. the gorgeous I Do); but the disc is dominated by no one genre, ranging from gritty rock (Lonely Road) and slow ballads (Your Loving Flame) to contemporary experiments (Spinning on an Axis) and Indian raga-pop (Riding to Jaipur). So saying you're almost guaranteed to love (and, by the same token, loathe) something here. David Kahn's production either has a modern edge or a modern coldness, depending on who you ask.    I loved Driving Rain when I first heard it, but I have slowly grown out of it for one reason or another. Perhaps as I have exposed myself to more of his catalogue I have come to realize that Driving Rain may be the most middle-of-the-road (pun intended) album Paul has ever produced. That said, remember who we're talking about here - middle-of-the-road McCartney is still more than listenable.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I bought the CD right after I saw the film and the only time I do that is if the movie and the soundtrack are on the same level. I don't care about the bad reviews. A lot of people liked the movie and so did I. Even more amazing is that the score is just as good as the film, like James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer watched it first without any music and then writing the music based on how the characters felt during a specific sequence. The result is a dark, brooding, air-tight score that doesn't only sound great in the movie theatres but also inside your car if you are one to listen to neo-classical-oriented musical juggernauts.
B000750OEA|5.0|This DVD is an outstanding video collection of Kylie's greatest hits. From her younger days to the present, she performs so effortlessly throughout all of these videos with the energy, passion, and sensuality that she is well-known for. It would be difficult to name a particular favorite, however, several that come to mind are \\"Never Too Late\\", \\"Better the Devil You Know\\", \\"Step Back in Time\\", \\"Slow\\", and \\"Red Blooded Woman\\". If you love Kylie, you'll absolutely love this DVD.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Having never been a big Foo Fighters fan I was impressed with the first single enough to give this set try.<br /><br />The first disk is energetic, motivated but not quite raw. Still, Groul adds the right hooks and vocals to keep interest. The only complaints \\"Now Way Back\\" could have had some more original lyrics and a third verse, it's too short for one of the strongest songs. Also, the reserved the moderately paced songs for the end, the issue with that is it leaves no change in tempo for the first six tracks. As a result they blend together like the first two Ramones albums, in an indistinctive blur. Suddenly the pace dies and slowly, so does the album. Not that the last few songs aren't solid, but together they bog the album down at the end, where as if they'd been placed through-out the album an more balanced, over-all record would have been achieved.<br /><br />Now, the second disk. I am not a hater of slow or acoustic music. I'm really into Tori Amos, Natalie Merchant, Pearl Jam. I like acoustic records, UnPlugged disk. Unfortunately this disk tries so hard to be soft that the songs never lift off, never gain emotion deapth or release, never inspire or bring about the urge to sing-a-long. Suddenly, after the first, powerful, hook-filled disk, we are treated to a psedo-Floyd lullabye. I've tried listening to it several times, I keep wanting the songs to go somehwere (like \\"nothing else matters\\" or \\"Betterman\\" or \\"fell on black days\\") unfortunately, nothing.<br /><br />Finally, a warning: DO NOT BUY SONY DUAL DISK! They are not DVD-AUDIO, that is a high-resolution, master-tape quality format that SONY DOES NOT USE becuase they where gready like with Betamax and wanted their SACD to dominate the market, but it went the way of Betamax. The dual disk does not contain enhanced audio it is 48000mgz @ 16bits, a standard CD is 44000mgz @ 16bits, there is no improvement in sound quality. REAL DVD-AUDIO is 98000mgz or 198000mgz @ 24bits and sounds like studio tape. THese dual disk are just the CD mixed at 5.1 but not with improved sound. They are a waste of money.<br /><br />Disk one ****1/2<br />Disk two **he CD mixed at 5.1 but not with improved sound. They are a waste of money.    Disk one ****1/2  Disk two **
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch is, in my opinion, the better of the two Guy Ritchie gangster movies. The actors are better for one thing, Dennis Farina is brilliant as the New York diamond merchant who hates to leave his country unless it's to sunny places where drinks are served with little umbrellas. Brad Pitt nearly steals the show as gypsy prize-fighter (accent spot on) who simply won't lie down and ads a thespian savvy and star quality that, let's face it, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrells wasn't exactly rolling in.<br />The story revolves around shenanigans in the London underground boxing world. Throw big money and lots of bad luck into the mix, sit back and watch the appropriate results ensue. Cue unhinged screen performance by Alan Ford as cockney gangland boss Bricktop, a guy you wouldn't want as your boss, for example, or bank manager. And there's Vinnie Jones, playing the poor defenceless lamb, a role to which he has become naturally accustomed.<br />The writing is good and tight and the whole package is elegantly put together with a tasteful collection of tunes for the soundtrack. And nice to see American thesps shine in Brit movies, for a change.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I have always loved the story of Willy Wonka, having watched it numerous times throughout my childhood (and some as an adult also).  I had heard things about Johnny Depp's performance as Wonka being somewhat like Michael Jackson!  How can that be?  He is nothing like that crazy (and dangerous) guy.  Johnny Depp played the role excellently, never too much, just right.  His flashbacks were hilarious.  The original Willy Wonka movie didn't follow the book story in so many parts, but this newer version did.  I thought Gene Wilder was a creepy man in the original in many ways.  The way he would stare at the children, the way he would get that crazy look in his eye like he was about to do something horrible.  Not so this new Willy Wonka.  This Willy apparently doesn't really like children too much and doesn't know what a warm, fuzzy feeling is.  He learns throughout the movie and by the end readily embraces Charlie's family as his own.  Charlie is, as the narrator says, an unremarkable boy.  He is poor, lives with both sets of grandparents, works hard in school, and is generally obedient.  So what if he spent the found $10 on a Wonka bar!  I would guess that he got change back since Grandpa gave him some change for a bar earlier so no need to worry that he was depriving his family from needed food.  Do yourself a favor--go see the movie.  Expect to be entertained, to laugh out loud many times, and to come away feeling like you've visited a wonderful fantasy land!
B00080ZG10|5.0|Fascinating, engrossing and original.  I feared it would be another empty, stiff, Oscar-fodder biopic.  It is in fact a scathingly real movie, a deeply personal account of a brilliant and tormented engineer, playboy, producer, and OCD sufferer.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is formal in tone and lush with period detail--but this extravagance empowers the movie instead of overpowering it.  The pivotal crash scene was particularly fantastic.  Aviator is a Spruce Goose--with such big-budget bulk, you wouldn't have thought it could get off the ground.
0767020308|4.0|Fist, let me explain that I gave this movie 4 stars because I couldn't give it 4.5, which in my opinion is what it really deserves. It is really a very good adaptation of one of my favorite Jane Austen's novels... I've lost count of how many times I had seen it! I really enjoy watching it because the story and the characters are very faithful to the book. Some parts of the book are not in the movie, but that's understandable since Emma is a long novel and the movie is already more than two hours long...  <br /> <br />I didn't give it five stars because I agree with some of the other reviewers that this version is a little dark. I think that the other version with Gwyneth Paltrow is more colorful and funny...(I actually have both ... my husband thinks I am nuts!) I also think that Kate Beckinsale's representation of Emma is a bit cold...I prefer how Paltrow represents this character. But overall I think this A&E production is an excellent adaptation ... so if you enjoyed the novel you'll love this movie! And if you haven't read the novel, but like romantic and lighthearted stories, you'll enjoy it too! <br />
B00005JNSK|4.0|Depp almost holds this film together, but the pointless flashbacks and altered ending nearly kill it.<br /><br />Feeling as forced as constipation, sudden, poorly timed, terribly set-up and useless to the story are Wonka's flashbacks. Now Burton didn't change the title, he left Charlies name at the top, not Wonkas and rightfully so, but he turned the focus away from Charlie and to the depraved childhood of Wonka.<br /><br />The flashbacks are not Rould Dahl material, they don't meld into the movie and they don't help. Now, if Candy doesn't have to have a point, why does Willy Wonka??? Seeing him as a kid in braces and a full head brace that holds his mouth open for the supposed benifit of strait teeth, does nothing but distract from the tale of five children that the book was about. Four brats, how they did themselves in and how Charlie never did.<br /><br />Quickly the story feels broken, like the tour is the unimportant part, the five golden ticket holders are secondary characters and it's Wonka's boring, not in the book, childhood that we are supposed to be following.<br /><br />Finally, we get to the \\"great glass elevator\\" and realize there is no sequel coming because the thing's way too small. At this point I started loosing hope. I had suffered through three Umpa Loompa songs with music so loud that I couldn't hear the lyrics (lifted, wisely from the book, but set to Seventies-pop grooves for reasons we will never know).<br /><br />Finally the Great Glass Elevator takes off, Charlie learns the factory is his and when we should go get the old folks and parents head into space (and a what-could-have-been sequel) we get a prudish, parent hating Wonka stating that Charlie may not bring his family to the factory. He leaves, alone, then comes back and with Charlie visits his estranged father (and just when I thought the love story in Titanic was forced and fake and a big mistake!) who has been a closet Willy Wonka follower since his son left to make candy (the ultimate sin to Dentist Dad)<br /><br />Now do we blast off? Do we finish the movie with the glorious shot of the elevator ascending into the upper atmosphere? No! We end with all the old folks dressed and out of bed, eating holiday dinner and living in the factory with Charlie and Wonka. Is this ending better? No! It's bland, it's not the story Dahl wrote, it serves no purpose.<br /><br />I am not a book purist, I love the third Harry Potter film more than the more faithful first two, I think LOTR is brilliant and I've read the book 5 times, but with this film the changes where un-called for and distracting, the detracted from the fun of the story.<br /><br />Now, why four stars??? Because if you cut all the Wonka flashbacks you have a near verbatim adaptation of the book, good actors, and lots of entertainment. Just gut 20 minutes of not-in-the-book footage, re-tool the last five minutes to match the book and it's near perfect.y (the ultimate sin to Dentist Dad)  <br /> <br />Now do we blast off?

0393324818|5.0|I do not know what took me so long to read this book.  Lewis is one of the better writers and this book did not disappoint. <br /> <br />I am a huge sports fan.  One of the issues that is ALWAYS discussed is how the little teams (small market teams) are getting screwed and how they will never be able to compete with the big money teams.  At first glance, this notion makes sense.  Big market teams have the money to go after any player they want while the small market teams are stuck picking up the cheap scraps.  Every commissioner talks about how this is going to ruin the sport because the small market teams will never be able to compete. <br /> <br />This book begins to change that thought process.  It is tiring to hear Bud Selig and others talk of how all teams are doomed simply because New York spends a lot of money.  I love how Lewis explains to the reader why that does not need to be the case.  Billy Beane and others have seen how if they try and compete with  the New Yorks, LAs, etc...with the same thought process as these teams, they will be waging a losing battle.  THey will be gobbled up and lose.  And lose often.  There are many small market teams that are still of that mindset. <br /> <br />Billy Beane and his group knew that was a losing battle so they went after another way.  This book is fascinating how it tracks the evolution of a new way of thinking...and why it was such a problem to the tradition filled baseball minds.  100 years of thinking one way and that was being challenged.  How dare they?   <br /> <br />It was fascinating to read that even when Beane and the As were having success, it was easy to just ignore them or call them an aberration.  Instead of trying to figure out why it worked for Oakland...they were simply dismissed or labeled as 'lucky.'   <br /> <br />The book is a great read.  It was well reported and well done.  Though it was basically a research study...it read like a novel and kept you interested and bothered by how others were not seeing why it was working.  Kudos to Lewis and heres hoping that other small markets will take a new approach to tackling their losing battle.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I usually write reviews for more grown-up stuff than this, but the X-Men movies really moved me.  I loved this movie, and went back to the place where I once dreamt of having my own superpowers and flying around the backyard.   <br /> <br />I loved both X-Men movies, and enjoyed the 2nd one as much as the first.  This is the best attempt at rendering a comic book into a movie, bar none, as far as I am concerned.  The directing was marvelous, the events, scenes, fights, everything was so well coordinated and choreographed that it just felt very cohesive and coherent.  And unlike so many other attempts at making a comic book hero come to life, the spirit of the comic book has been carried onward faithfully, and very artistically.  <br /> <br />The original X-Men was the greatest comic book series going on in Marvel Comics, and was a work of art.  It was also my very favorite as a child, and watching the movie version, either I or II, really brings the whole X-Men experience back to life for me.   The X-men were a raw dose of the real substance of \\"science fiction\\" that was less respectable, and often more artistic.  And it was the artistic side that brought me back again and again.   The original comic book was drawn in an expressive fashion that really did something for me.  They did more than find better ways to say \\"Blam!\\" And the movie was true to that spirit.  <br /> <br />And as for the story and characters: The pathos of the outcast, the Macbeth-like role of the Wolverine, and the various mutants' \\"powers,\\" ancient magical powers dressed up as science; this is some of the stuff that made the X-Men so powerful an experience for any dejected 12 year-old with a quarter (like me) way back when.  And even now I think fondly of my childish fantasies of developing my native telepathic powers and joining the ranks of the X-Men, so those local boys wouldn't ever beat me up and steal my lunch money again. If I could have worked that out, I would have been able to spend alot more playing Asteroids.  <br /> <br />It was also great seeing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos without her makeup for a little while.  Definitely the most gorgeous Russian bad-gal actress I have looked upon for a while.  She really steals the show in that skimpy blue outfit.   <br /> <br />I can't wait for X-Men III to come out, and I guess it should be beginning production in a early August.  Therre are not many movies I look forward to eagerly, but if you want a little escape to a land of childhood adventure, you could hardly do better.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Ignore the negative winers. This album is, yet again, a Dream Theater classic. Songs like The Root mof All Evil, Panic Attack, and the epic title track are classics. Buy this album along with Catch 33 by Meshuggah and Enemy of God by Kreator for 2005's best albums. This album is recommended. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper, and I approve of this review.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I didn't what to expect from the film as I've never watched any of QT's other films. However, I couldn't help but enjoy the humour injected various scenes and then seconds later Uma slices and dices her opponents. It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be, however it still has some explicit scenes depicting some of the killings. It is mostly about revenge, however, it is not revealed why Bill attacked the bride in the first place. Hopefully Vol. 2 tells us that.
B0007P3582|4.0|this was a good cd but it didn't have enough edge. I just think this cd was soft. If I were you I would buy any of his other cd's. But still get this cd.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna returns with the GRAMMY award winning \\"Ray Of Light\\" and possibly her most mature album to date. Her past work has been inconsistent and patchy. Madonna has the potential to pull off some great albums and so far critically her best work up to the release of \\"Ray Of Light\\" was \\"Like A Prayer\\". Madonna has been one of the most inventive and raw artists of all time and one of the most recognisable artists of the 20th century onwards.<br /><br />For fans this is the ULTIMATE Madonna album because for years she had been billed as a 'Material Girl' and with this album she saved herself from her early 90's slump and re-invented herself into a more appealing and wholesome. This album is probably her first album free of sex, controversy and 80's pop. Now Madonna is a great artist and I really admire her work and this album is one of my favourites. The way she has matured is phenomenal.<br /><br />This album works really well for me, William Orbit is certainly an asset on this album. \\"Ray of Light\\"'s biggest hit was the Billboard Hot 100 hit \\"Frozen\\" peaking at #2, yet all tracks are as good as that, some even better.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the mellow track \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\". Even though it is a vey downbeat electronic track it's chorus is very strong and the verses are incredible. \\"Swim\\" is the second song on the album and it's lyrics are very well written with a good play on words. Again the chorus and beats are a highlight. The title track \\"Ray Of Light\\" is next and again demonstrates Madonna's incredible vocal talent, this is one of the best tracks for her vocally on this album. \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" sounds a bit like track 1 & track 5 however it's a good track nonetheless and has superbly crafted lyrics. \\"Skin\\" is the longest track on the album at 6 minutes and 22 seconds yet it's well worth the listen. Next is the beautiful track \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" which has a very bouncy chorus yet staying so mature and sophisticated. The chorus is again a highlight. \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is yet another track on which Madonna has again re-invented herself the sound here is more subdued and mellow during the verses.<br /><br />\\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" is a creepy and dark track that is haunting yet beautiful at the same time. I love how the lyrics are in another language, the question I'm asking is what language?<br /><br />\\"Frozen\\" is undoubtedly the most well-known track on this album and is again to put it simply, beautiful. Lush beats provide a wonderful backdrop for Madonna's vocals. \\"The Power Of Good-Bye\\" is probably my favourite track on the album as I instantly fell in love with it upon my first listen. Addictive. \\"To Have And Not To Hold\\" has a nice ironic title and a nice sound to it as well. \\"Little Star\\" is written for Madonna's child and has lovely, cute lyrics and a superb beat. The last track is \\"Mer Girl\\" written about Madonna's experience with her mum and I like the quietly hushed sound and Madonna's tender vocals.<br /><br />At the end after listening to this superb albums you wonder howmuch further she can invent herself.

B000002BE9|5.0|Oh Fiona, please come back yesterday!  Where are you??  I pulled this CD out of my CD graveyard and re-realized just how much I adore you, your style and this brilliant CD! Not only can I listen to this without skipping any tracks, I can listen and feel the thought and emotion you put into every song.  Tidal moves me like few CD's can and even if you never come back, I will always cherish this wonderful piece of work (but contemplate it anyway) All the songs flow together like the CD is a story instead of seperate recordings.  Thank you thank you thank you for showing what true musicianship is!  For all those who have lost faith in young women in the music industry, this album is truly a spark of hope!!
B000002JKA|5.0|This is the best Dream Thetaer album, along with I&W and SFAM. Songs like 6:00, Lie, Caught In A Web, and The Mirror are classics. Buy this album, along with I&W and SFAM, if you're new to DT. This album is very very recommended. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper and I approve of this review.
B00005R24K|5.0|The Evil Dead follows the story of 5 Collage students who go to a secluded cabin in the mountians.  Once they get there strange things start to happen which leads to non-stop terror.  Anyone who likes the horror genre will love this movie.  Its filled with enough blood and gore to satisfy everyone's needs.  I strongly recommend this movie. I even own it.
B00003XAQ5|1.0|If you are particular about what emanates from your speakers,  don't bother. The standard re-mastered CD is as good and the original LP is markedly superior when played on a decent turntable with a better than average cartridge. <br />Either this particular effort was poorly engineered or too much upfront quality was sacrificed to appease the gods of multi channel whiz bangs. The high end is over driven, the upper mid-range is muddy, and compared to the presence of the original LP, it sounds as if it were recorded in a cave. Al in all, a very poor example of super audio technology. <br /> <br />Tone deaf
0446677450|4.0|I began reading this book with expectations of concrete, specific financial investments and strategies for increasing my meager wealth. Dismayed, and even angered at finding none, I nonetheless continued reading - mostly because of the relationship between the author and his *rich dad* (actually a friend's father). The lessons the rich father bestowed on the author are charming, insightful and, most of all, revolultionary. <br /> <br />In the beginning, Mr. Kiyosaki's message reminded me of that Steve Martin joke: How to live like a millionaire without paying taxes. First, get a million dollars. Then, don't pay taxes. The oversimplification of what, on the surface, appears to be an obvious solution, alienated me. The author maintains that to be successful managing wealth, one needs to become EDUCATED in managing wealth. Well . . . duh. <br /> <br />However, his message is directed at a problem I didn't realize existed: the notion that *having a job and saving* will make us wealthy, or even allow us adequate retirements. I have four children. Two of them grown, one still in school, and one still in diapers. <br /> <br />The one in diapers will not receive the same advice regarding education and wealth that his brothers and sister received. <br /> <br />Although my recommendation of the content of *Rich Dad Poor Dad* is worthy of five stars, I found the quantity of redundancy and the author's amateurish sentence and paragraph structures making me wish he had spent some of his grand wealth on an editor. Minus one star for poor grammar. Otherwise, a valuable book.
B0007YMUZW|3.0|After hearing much greatness about this album, and hearing it being compared to one of the greatest albums of the year (Bright Eye's 'I'm Wide Awake It's Morning')I had to get it and listen to it.  I am a little disapoited in it but don't get me wrong, it is a good album and much better than most music out there but it clearly is not as good as the new Bright Eyes disc who he is compared to often.   There are, however a few WONDERFUL songs that are worth getting the album for like 'Friends', 'When Will You Come Back Home?' and 'How Do you Keep Love Alive'!  Those are all excellent tracks but this album is flawed.  His writing for one has no great skills and his singing is to 'pop' for anything of great value.  But it is worth it - believe me!
B00005UEAR|5.0|This, along with TOT, FII, and Octavarium, is the most underrated DT album to date. Songs like The Glass Prison, The Great Debate, and the 42 minute (!) title track are classics.

0783225857|5.0|This movie is, safe to say, on just about everyones favorite movie listing.  Harper Lee's classic novel brought to life with Gregory Peck in the lead role of Atticus Finch.  I don't think Gregory Peck ever did a bad movie in his film career and he shines in this one.  As Atticus, he displays the kind of lawyer that you would want if you ever had to go to trial for anything.  He also displays a pretty good example to all us fathers on how to deal with our children.  There are some very good ideologies displayed in this movie.  The idea that all men are equal in the eyes of the court was displayed with Atticus defending a black man against a flimsy rape charge.  I'm not sure in 30's Alabama you could ever get a fair and impartial jury on this count.  This is a very satisfying movie that everyone, including your children, should watch.  The movie really hits home in alot of areas and is well worth adding to your movie library.
B00000293E|5.0|The person who wrote that editorial review above should be dragged out an' shot (well, maybe not SHOT, but ya'know ridiculed and have his feelings hurt) for callin' Willie \\"nothing special\\". From a composition standpoint alone he deserves to rank with the greats. In fact, this album here is worth it for jus' ONE song: 'I Can't Quit You, Baby'. That joint got me OPEN. Jus' listen to that wail he lets loose at the start 'fore the music's even kicked in an' tell me his voice didn't have every bit the power that the more well-known Delta and Chicago blues artists had. I mean this stuff is raw, down-and-dirty BLOOD music; hard-drivin' blues, soft blues, barroom brawl blues, ya jus' can't lose. This the only album'a his that I own, but is' enough for me to tell y'all without a shadow of a doubt in my mind that Willie Dixon was the MAN plain an' simple. C'mon now. Don't even get me started on 'Spoonful' or 'Back Door Man'. The latter in particular will pump more testosterone through your speakers an' out into your body n' soul than all the gangsta rappers out there could COMBINED. Overall, I'm gonna say no other less-than-10 song blues album possesses the consistancy that this one does. This stuff is timeless.
0670033375|1.0|I found the refrence (page 371) to Chinese people alongside beetles, diseases, and some virulent and adaptive carp to be extremely racist and fundamentally unacceptable. People should not be named alongside diseases and animals, especially in such an insulting manner. Diamond's blatant disrespect for other cultures in this case attests to the racism and possibly nefarious intents in writing this book.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater is by far my favorite band, and this is thier best album. Songs like Home, Strange Deja Vu, Overture 1928, and Finally Free are classics that will stand the test of time. Buy this album with Images & Words and Awake and avoid crap from bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Papa Roach, and Evanescence. This album is gets my highest recommendation. 5 stars man. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper, and I approve of this review.
B0002858YS|5.0|the best album of the year!!!(maybe)=el mejor album del ao (quizas). <br />The dark_side of this album is here....As i have lisened it so many times and now i know all its lyrics (ooouucchhh!!),that s all.They are other songs pretty cool ,but there are not in the cd ,then if you re a fan of them you must becoming searcher this songs.
6304696566|5.0|On this site there are over 100 fan-reviews of this movie, and many tell the plot in great detail, therefore, my reivew will be short and sweet.  With the great John Ford directing, John Wayne starring, and a superb story line - all this adds up to a 5-star movie if there ever was one!  You cannot go wrong buying this DVD - it delivers!<br /><br />Now considered possibly the greatest weatern movie of all-time, \\"The Searchers\\" was panned by the critics of its day for being just another \\"ho-hum\\" John Wayne western.  It took years, but modern critics and viewers now recognize it as an epic of western filmmaking that perhaps will never be topped.  If I had to choose one movie that represented the best of the west, it is undoubtedly \\"The Searchers\\".<br /><br />John Wayne gives his most intense acting performance as the dark and vengeful Ethan Edwards, who vows to kill the Commanche raiders that murdered his beloved sister-in-law, brother, and took captive two of their daughters.  Wayne easily carries the film on his broad brooding shoulders, pursuing the Indians for over 5 years through summer and winter, ever relentless to see their chief, \\"Scar\\", dead, and his captive nieces rescued.<br /><br />Director John Ford is at the height of his creative powers in directing this western masterpiece.  He weaves so many different themes and levels of interpretation into the film, that one discovers something new with each viewing.  It would take a small treatise to bring out all the subtle details.<br /><br />Succinctly and to the point, \\"The Searchers\\" is a film that you will watch again and again, and love it each time a bit more.  It is that absolute best in western filmmaking!<br /><br />Jim Konedog Koenig
B00074CBMY|5.0|I've been a Joe Cocker fan since Woodstock. I've always thought of him as a rocker. I'm also a huge blues fan and I must admit that I never noticed until Heart & Soul that Joe is one of the best blues singers around today and in that I include someone like Jonny Lang. His cover of One (both the in studio and live versions) is incredible. Sorry, U2, Joe now \\"owns\\" that song. Anyone who can take a Tom Jones song (I Who Have Nothing) and make it a blues tune has to be a genius. Plus with the situation in Iraq, Joe does a heartfelt, emotional and most timely version of What's Going On. While taking away nothing from R.E.M., his cover of Everybody Hurts is also world class. With his raspy voice, it sounds like a different song. Thanks, Joe.
B000089RVX|1.0|I ahte Evanescence like they were hitler themselves. I'd review this further, but I'd be wasting what John already wrote. You hit the nail on the head, man! Buy Train of Thought by Dream Theater instead.
B00064X3BI|5.0|Finally, Slowhand comes to hi-resolution format. I have heard multiple CD versions from the original to the Gold Disc to the remastered, but this new SACD version just blows the rest away. <br /> <br />Slowhand has always been my favourite Clapton album over the years. Classic Clapton originals like Lay Down Sally and Wonderful Tonight define his style and songwriting capabilities and singing. His voice has an aching and tender reach on the ballads, and yet bluesy growl on the fast tracks. <br /> <br />From 461 and Slowhand, Clapton began to rely less on his guitar prowess on albums, but move towards stronger songwriting and singing to establish his albums, and Slowhand is the best example of it. And yet, his taste for covers cannot be faulted either. <br /> <br />Dusting off JJ Cale's Cocaine and William's We're With YOu All the Way shows how he can choose the right material to augment his own songs, until they blend into a seamless piece of excellent work.  <br /> <br />Ending the album with an instrumental ballad that recalls the piano coda to Layla, Slowhand remains his best and most focused work over the years. And throw in a great guitar jam in the epic Core, you get a Clapton masterwork that is as timeless now as it was commercially and critically successful during its original release almost 30 years ago. <br /> <br />Listening to the 5.1 mix by the original producer, Glyn Johns did a superb work. Although some has commented the mix sounds muddy, its actually not and its true to its original sound. Its natural and spatial mix and creative surround mixing by Johns gives this classic a new dimension that was not there before. <br /> <br />The electric solos now sound more alive and kicking and even the tender fender licks that kick off Wonderful Tonight sounds so much there and enveloping. Its the drums that has a tendency to sound muddled underneath and the strong bass levels that gives the muddy impression. BUt '70s recordings tend to be presented in such fashion and listening it over again, the surround mix is just perfect and natural. Compared to the bright but not as creative surround mix of 461, this is far superior in the end. <br /> <br />A compulsory purchase and listening for every Clapton fan. <br /> <br />
B00000ADG2|5.0|I've been listening to this album since I was about 8 and I've loved it since then. Her lyrics take you to a different place, they make you think. This album is like a journey; through love, hard times, and to success. To me she is like what Kanye West is trying to be now, a MUSICAL GENIUS. She can sing, she can rap, she can write... Lauryn Hill is truly an inspiration to young artists. Some of my favorites on this album are \\"Lost Ones\\", \\"Ex-Factor\\", \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\", \\"Superstar\\", \\"Final Hour\\", \\"I Used To Love Him\\" with MJB, \\"Forgive Them Father\\", \\"Every Ghetto Every City\\", \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" with D'Angelo, and \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\". I recommend this album for ANYONE who is a fan of good music. BKLYNBABYLON signing off...
B0006L16N8|3.0|Firstly, I admit that I am a fan of Coldplay's music. I think it's great. I am not however taken aback by anything they do. I don't exactly condemn this album entirely but personally I think it sounded exactly the same as \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\". Listening to the albums back to back, if I had no idea that these were two different albums I would have assumed that it was one very long and emotionally strung out album. Lyrically they aren't brilliant and musically I don't think they're incredible either. What dissapointed me about listening to this album was like I mentioned was that it sounded just like thier previous work. I wrongly assumed that after waiting three years touring the world, meeting new cultures and people, they would be able to come together and explore new and different sounds and lyrics that approach something other than \\"love\\"(scartchinhg the surface that's what they all sound like to me-maybe I'm just an idiot.) Personally I think that alot of these songs sound like the same ones on the same album! I like Colplay don't get me wrong but I like change and I like to see bands grow and personally I didn't feel it at all on this album. I just don't understand the huge hype this group gets.
B0000024K1|5.0|This is the best rap album ever imo. Sogns like Bring The Noise, Don't Believe The Hype, and Mind Terorist are classics. Buy this album along with Fear of a Black Planet and aovid horrible albums by rappers out today. I may be a metalhead but every now and then I'll listen to old school rap. Public Enemy are my favorite rap artist. This album is recommended.    My name is Ripper, and I approve of this review.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Constantine certainly makes up for most of the senseless trash that's put out in the theaters today. The script was well-made. Alot of time was clearly put into the plot. <br /> <br />Excellent performances were put-forth for Constantine. I really enjoyed Peter Stormare's performance in his role of Satan and Tilda Swinton's in her role of the archangel Gabriel. Although, I did find it kind of odd that a woman was cast as Gabriel... But, she handled the role so well that in the end, casting a female rather than a male in that role did seem more fitting. It really worked. But, my favorite portrayal of Gabriel is still Christopher Walken's in the Prophecy series (I recommend that series for supernatural thrillers, too!).  <br /> <br />Reeves and Weisz both put-forth great performances. I don't know why people are trying to compare Reeves's performance in this movie to that of his much earlier role in The Devil's Advocate. The way he's acting in this movie might be along the same track as Advocate's, but if so, why care? The way he portrays John Constantine is what the movie called for: a dark mind. And Contantine and Advocate are two completely different films with two completely different scenarios. The only similarity: they both deal with heaven and hell. Period. Deal with it. And don't even think of bringing up The Matrix. It's a masterpiece of filmmaking on its own wavelength. Similar concept: both Neo and Constantine are trying to save humanity. You get that alot in movies today. <br /> <br />The special-effects were mind-blowing. Whatever team of graphic designers worked on these demons really knew what they were doing. Nothing cheesy. <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with Constantine. It's great. And I recommend listening to the commentary while watching it. Just give Constantine a try. Nothing bad here. Just 2 hours of superb acting with loads of mind AND eye candy! <br /> <br />***Buy the 2-Disc Deluxe Edition. It's just worth it.
0451191153|3.0|Unbelievably, I actually didn't hate this book. Despite my husband's insistence upon hanging Ayn's portrait in our den and the fact that it ultimately contributed to the demise of my marriage. <br /> <br />When my husband at the time bought it for me so that I could try to understand and relate to his obsession with Ms. Rand's philosophy, I was a good sport. I actually enjoyed the book, and we even enjoyed the movie together. But I warn readers and potential readers: Tread cautiously. And if you meet someone claiming to LOVE Ayn Rand - run fast and don't look back. <br /> <br />It's not cool or noble to emulate Howard and Dominique to prove to the world and yourself just how important it is to only think of yourself and no one else. Living your life like this on a daily basis can cause destruction, pain, years of heartache and can damage the lives of those around you for years to come.  <br /> <br />This is what my former husband did. Woke up one morning and out of the blue, told me he didn't want to be married anymore.  What did he cite? Ultimately, Ayn's edict of selfishness. My inability to understand this caused my husband to leave me. Operating for himself and only for himself, he continued to disintegrate little by little - taking a married woman as his mistress, breaking up hers and our marriage, isolating himself from friends and family, and several years later - continuing to live a lie - all masked under Ayn's philosophy of selfishness. <br /> <br />The end of my marriage nearly killed me. If I could stop the sad reality of divorce in this country, I would. In my 31 years of existence, I've experienced nothing worse. But now I'm happy to report that I have found a partner who exhibits more selfLESSness on a daily basis than I ever thought was possible. And I've been blessed to witness the other extreme. This is how we're meant to live on earth - making the world a better place and helping those in need. I'm not saying that one's own needs aren't important- they certainly are - just not at the expense of dozens of loved ones and certainly not to appease Ms. Rand as she rots in her grave. <br /> <br />Read the book and see what I mean. Read the book to become well-versed in Rand's banter and atheist philosophies. Just don't read the book and become an advocate of selfishness. The world doesn't need any more of those.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|My god! This music physically and emotionally stimualtes you! I love thier creativity and thier relentless quest to explore new concepts, sounds and lyrics. I think by far The Mars Volta is one of the most creatively and artistically stimulated bands to come across \\"the music industry\\" ( especailly at a time when all was thought lost). Their music actaully creates different visual paintings in your head every time you listen to them! They are phenomenal! I highly reccomend this album to anyone who is looking to look for a journey beyond the senses. Enjoy!
B000002HK4|5.0|A change of Seasons is by far my favorite DT song. And since DT is my favorite band, that makes it my favorite song of all time. The covers are great too, but the title track is worth it alone. Buy this EP right now and be sure to avoid the next Britney Spears album, which will reek. This EP is very highly recommended. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper and I approve of that review.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|You will see a standard disaster movie, like many that have come before it. This time, global warming is the culprit. Silly me, I thought global warming would make things hot, but it cracks the polar ice cap and makes things cold, as it brings giant tornado destruction to Los Angeles, grapefruit-size hail in Tokyo, and a monster tidal wave that engulfs Manhattan. The water then freezes, turning Manhattan into an arctic place. The human action doesn't contribute much to the story, but the disaster scenes make it all worth watching, as long as you don't take any of it seriously. This is a nice movie to watch if you just want to relax.
B000002P6R|2.0|Well, uhm, it happens to be true. Pete Townshend wrote some powerful, beautiful stuff for THE WHO BY NUMBERS. I wonder if anyone really understands how moving and how deep that numbers like \\"Imagine a Man\\" and \\"They're All in Love\\" really are? Well anyway, Pete goofed here big time, as did the rest of the band without Keith Moon as their drummer. Sad situation that was. There once was a band called the Who... So although they messed this up big time, there are of couple of funny (yet still pathetic) songs like \\"Cache Cache\\" and \\"How can you Do it Alone?\\" that justify its puny existence. It is sad and quite poignant that the Who had to break down like this, but check out their back catalogue for great material and you'll find that in reality they could have easily stood up to any of the world's greatest bands.
B000002TQV|5.0|great from start to finish, nice variety of soft songs to harder songs. good stuff.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is the best album of 1992. This is my second DT album with SFAM my fvaorite. Songs like Metropolis Part 1, Learning to Live, Under A Glass Moon, and Pull Me Under are classics. Buy this along with SFAM and Awake for the best DT albums and best albums you'll ever hear. This album is very very recomended. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper and I approve of this review.
B000001EL3|5.0|This is Kiss's fifth studio album. It was also the very first Kiss album I ever had. It is still one of my favorites. (And I usually get bored of albums quickly!) The majority of the songs here are written by Paul Stanley. Who I find to be a great writer of songs.  <br /> <br />Everything is very powerful from start to finish. This album along with Alive! are the trademark albums of the makeup years. They remind us of the good old times. Not to say everything in the non-makeup era is bad because that is not true. Anyway hears my point of view on the album. <br /> <br />1) DETROIT ROCK CITY: This song was written by Paul Stanley and Bob Ezrin (The producer) and I would have to say is my favorite. It starts you off with an intro from a radio station about a young kid who was driving on the wrong side of the road and had a head on collision with a delivery truck. After this fades out the car starts and eventually you hear that oh so addictive beat fade in from Gene's bass guitar. By the way the song is a story about the young kid who dies on the way to a concert. Unbelievably catchy chorus line. Great Ace solo. <br /> <br />2) KING OF THE NIGHT TIME WORLD: Another Paul Stanley piece. During this song he is reffering to himself as a sort of undeniable king. That everybody wants to be like or be with. Lines like, \\"I'm the king of the night time world/Come live your secret dream.\\" It's not my favorite but does appear on atleast one greatest hits compilation. <br /> <br />3) GOD OF THUNDER: I love this one it  is so mesmerizing. Lot's of neat sound effects. It was written by Paul but sung by Gene Simmons. A song about being the greatest of all gods. Commander of everything. Lines like, \\"I was born on Olympus,\\" \\"I am the lord of the wastelands,\\" and \\"I command you to kneel before the...God of Thunder!\\" A great gothic stomper. Perfect for kiss. <br /> <br />4) GREAT EXPECTATIONS: This song goes out to all of Gene Simmons' ladies. Features a chorus of some sort kids choir. \\"You watch me playing guitar, and you see what my hands can do/And you wish you were the one I was doing it to.\\" Just a taste of what to expect. It's so Gene. <br /> <br />5) FLAMING YOUTH: I never really warmed to this song. Although it is written by Gene, Paul, and Ace! Basically it is about what's plainly written in the title, childhood behavior. Sung by Paul.  <br /> <br />6) SWEET PAIN: This one is Gene Simmons all the way. With words like, \\"You'll get to love me and my sweet pain/My love will drive you insane.\\" A surprisingly delightful immature song. <br /> <br />7) SHOUT IT OUT LOUD: A great party song thats just a lot of fun. Also has a bonus of Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons in an almost duet. Just crank it up and have fun. And make sure to shout it out loud! <br /> <br />8) BETH: This song is absolutely amazing. You can hear the angst in Peter Criss' voice as he sings to his beloved wife. Powerful lyrics, \\"You say feel so empty/That our house just ain't a home/I'm always somewhere else/And your always there alone.\\" And of course the touching refrain of \\"O, Beth what can I do?\\" An out of this world love song. <br /> <br />9) DO YOU LOVE ME?: Another song by Paul Stanley. Which fits Kiss perfectly. \\"You like the concerts and studios/And all the money, honey/But...Do you love me?\\" Is it true love or just love for the money? \\"Do really love me?\\" <br /> <br />To wrap up this album, I think it is amazing. no contest top three kiss albums ever. It just brings you back to the makeup era. The crazy concerts, the raw party instincts. It's just the definitive kiss album. This is who they were. If you want the real kiss get this album.
B00005JNJT|3.0|For these kinds of films? Well, Nolan's first major film since INSOMNIA is a nice combination of action and horror (believe it or not)and it provides an interesting thesis on human being's repsonses to fear. It is not so unfortunate that Burton's vision has been moved aside, but it may be unfortunate that this Batman movie is a serious drama and has little of the fun for the people who enjoyed Micheal Keaton's films. So you'd better get that out of your head before watching this. Also, don't take small children or squeamish adults to this movie, because it is loaded with darkness and some truly unsettling images and nightmarish moments. Christian Bale hasn't really had any decent acting roles until this, but although he is a fine actor and a competent new star for my generation, Batman is simply too strong for its own good. Here we get the rundown on the League of Shadows and that stuff, and Bruce Wayne's history and condition is explained from the beginning. There are slow moments, but also many jarringly violent scenes, so it is ultimately hard to access once its over. Plus it goes on for a lot longer than any other Batman film. Arty, original, and highly impressive production-wise, this movie isn't for all tastes but it is a unique picture for those who want a new Batman and for a new vision of a superhero. The greatest superhero movie ever it is NOT, but if you can handle its brutality and nightmarish realism (basically), you may find it to be the best film of the year. It will certainly take you by surprise.
B00009NHC5|5.0|One of the best Classic edge of your seat intense movies!  I am not impressed with the lousy plot, slashim, gore 'horror' movies of today.  But this is one of Audry Hepburns finest!  Playing a blind lady trying to defend herself from a ruthless drug dealer.  It is great!
B000002HPT|5.0|I don't see why people hate this album. This is an awesome album. Songs like Trail of Tears, New Millennium, and Burning My Soul are classic songs. But this album if you're a hardcore DT fan like me, but casual fans can pass this up. This album is very recommended. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper, and I approve of this review.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne is to Ashlee Simpson <br />As Target is to Wal*Mart <br />As WB is to UPN <br />As Joan Jett is to Pat Benetar
B00008GKEG|5.0|This DVD is essential whether you're only slightly interested in rock or you love it, because the Beatles are shown throughout and you have more video clips, interviews, audio files, and photos than you could find anywhere else. Watch the \\"Revolution\\" video at full blast, and catch rare White album studio performances, and see the roof top concert in all its glory. The Beatles' music holds a special place in my early life, and watching this brings back many great memories, but their albums, of coarse, are just as essential.
B00005YUPO|1.0|Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven are much better musically and visually than Baby Bach which is unfortunate because of the wonderful pieces that could have been used but were not.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is the best album of 2003, along with Dance of Death by Iron Maiden. Songs like As I Am, Endless Sacrifice, and In The Name of God are classics. Buy this album along with SFAM, I&M, Awake, ah hell buy all their albums. This album is highly recomended. <br /> <br />My name is Ripper and I approve of this review.
B0000026NC|5.0|Visually, P.U.L.S.E. is better. But musically, Delicate Sound of Thunder is a lot better. Yeah, P.U.L.S.E. has more songs and the entire Dark Side of the Moon, but the band just kind of sounded rusty. On this one though, they sound amazing! \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\" doesn't sound too great and the \\"wooing\\" the ladies do on \\"Money\\" gets a little old, but everything else makes up for it. \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Run Like Hell,\\" and all of the songs from A Momentary Lapse of Reason sound better on this than on their studio albums. Especially Comfortably Numb. David Gilmour does an awsome guitar solo on the ending of it. They've also got one of the coolest saxaphone players of all time playing in the concert. If you're looking for a really good live album, get this. I also recommend Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live.
B0000035E7|4.0|As we all know, Nirvana would eventually become the biggest rock band of the Nineties, starting an alternative revolution that can be still be felt. But few people know of the band's ragged, $600 debut, hashed out in a converted garage. The band at this point, dealt almost exclusively in slow, Zeppelin-inspired punk riffage, though the poppy \\"About a Girl,\\" the lightning-speed \\"Downer,\\" and the groovy \\"Blew\\" show signs of variety. This is more of a historical curiosity than an stand-alone album, but still worth owning if you don't mind sifting (pardon the pun) through the filler.
B000059TEP|5.0|I just finished watching Ghost and I honestly must tell you it was one of the best romances I've ever seen.  It was a great film because it blends like every genre together into one amazing movie.  The scenes with \\"Unchained Melody\\" will leave you with a chill.  This movie is beautiful and breathtaking.  Having only thing Swayze in \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" I must say I was a heck of a lot more impressed by his role in this where he was VERY convincing.  You felt like Demi and Pat shared a binding love.  Honestly, the only thing that looked dated were the \\"demons\\".  And it was funny seeing those ancient computers.  Whoopi was hilarious.  Even though this movie is 15 years old, it's still wonderful.  Highly recommended.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />\\"Van Helsing\\" is a campy, tongue-in-cheek homage to the three key figures of classic movie horror - Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man - and those who do them battle.  Hugh Jackman is the mysterious Van Helsing, a centuries-old monster-slayer who works sub rosa for the Catholic Church in its ongoing battle with the forces of evil.  In this tale, Van Helsing is sent off to Transylvania to destroy the famed Count Dracula, a vampire who's been rampaging through the countryside for more than four hundred years now, making life miserable for the inhabitants therein.<br /><br />Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, \\"Van Helsing\\" is a sometimes entertaining, sometimes half-baked adventure tale, beautiful to look at but largely devoid of any real suspense or excitement.  The action scenes are overwrought and redundant, filled with computer-generated special effects that are surprisingly second-rate in nature.  However, the art direction and set design do an outstanding job creating a Transylvania that plays upon our memories of those Universal classics from the 1930's.  Moreover, David Wenham serves as an effective cowardly/comic Sancho Panza-type sidekick for the more staid and conventionally heroic Van Helsing, who suffers pangs of remorse when he is forced to destroy the monsters.<br /><br />The final battle scene between Van Helsing and Dracula does drag on for a minor eternity, but the movie, overall, should satisfy rabid fans of the action film genre.  The rest of us can find intermittent entertainment gawking at the scene.
B000002N1E|5.0|Prince has a lot of albums that I would rate 5 stars, but I would say that this is his best. All the songs are great and each one sounds different. \\"Shhh\\" is a little weaker than the rest and the npg operator gets old after awhile, but other than that it's perfect. My personal favorites are \\"P Control,\\" \\"Endorphin Machine,\\" \\"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World,\\" \\"Dolphin,\\" \\"Shy,\\" \\"Billy Jack Bitch,\\" and \\"Gold.\\" \\"Gold\\" is one of the most amazing songs that I've ever heard. It's worth the price just for that one alone! They really ought to put this album back in print. I'm pretty sure that the album went gold so it's not like it wasn't selling very well.
B000003TAR|4.0|Nirvana was overwhlmed by the sudden success of \\"Nevermind,\\" and the baggage that came with superstardom, so Kurt Cobain wrote punishing new songs and hooked up with noise maven Steve Albini (of 'Surfer Rosa' fame) to make this album. And from start to finish, this is a more diverse album than \\"Nevermind,\\" showing that, even though Kurt was trying to alienate his audience, he was still progressing as an artist. \\"Serve the Servants\\" features harsh commentary on his father and the ill-treatment of Courtney Love, \\"All Apologies\\" is easily one of Nirvana's finest ballads, and the noisy bursts of effected feedback that drench the ironically titled \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" are pure genius. But parts of this album are simply too indulgent, such as the silly \\"Tourette's,\\" \\"Rape Me,\\" which angrily (and stupidly) rewrites his biggest hit and \\"Very Ape,\\" which feels more like a last-minute rumination than a full song. But this is still an excellent album, though I don't suggest this to the 'Nevermind' crowd.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I listen to this CD all the time, I just love it!
B00006FDCD|5.0|I cannot believe that someone would make such harsh statements about actors who have died!!!! What is your dysfunction Maurice?  I'm not even going to talk about this amazing movie cause i'm so f**k**g P***ed that a human being would be so cruel!  I would recommend you MAURICE to go back to whatever wacko 3rd world country your family escaped from!!!
B00005JLT5|5.0|I have seen this movie thrice or may be more . Each moment depicts the pathos and pangs of seperation from closed ones in WW I. Adrein Brody excells as performer , so does other characters. The best moment of the film is where he tries to play the piano when the German general asks him and he breaks down after playing it. It shows that music is his life and love . I liked this film for its wonderful soundtrack and the way it flows . Cudos to Polanski for this beautiful film.
B000002NJS|5.0|Along with 'Like a Prayer,' this is among Madonna's best work. In 1998, Madonna updated her sound in a huge way, embracing electronica, Indian music, trip-hop, and chunky stadium-rock riffage, coupled with an increased focus on spirituality, to create one of the best rock/electronica albums ever. The rave-worthy title track sits along three of Madonna's best ballads (the psychedelic \\"substitute for love\\", the dramatic \\"Frozen,\\" and the shimmering \\"Power of Good-Bye\\") as well as slow-building numbers like \\"Skin\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters.\\" This is a must-own disc, and it shows Madonna at her peak as an album artist.
B000002UVX|5.0|Band of Gypsys is a different kind of Hendrix album.  But oh, how magnificent.  Easily one of his best live recordings, it's extremely funky, extremely loud, and extremely powerful.  From the groovy opener \\"Who Knows,\\" to the 12-minute epic \\"Machine Gun\\" to the unbelievable \\"Power to Love,\\" this is an incredible album, from start to finish. <br /> <br />Band of Gypsys clocks in at about 41 minutes, only three minutes longer than The Jimi Hendrix Experience's \\"Axis: Bold As Love.\\"  But these six songs pack such a more powerful punch.  Very dynamic and raw, this is the epitome of a live performance - something you'd pay to see. <br /> <br />When this album was released in 1970, it won a Gold Record Award from the RIAA.  And rightfully so.  If I haven't said enough about how great this album is already, then I'll say it again: this album is outstanding.  Jimi Hendrix has a plethora of live recordings.  But before you get any of them - before you get Woodstock, before you get Monterey, before you get Berkeley - get Band of Gypsys.
0446677450|5.0|i thought this book was reao my really helpful to my learnings. Right now im takin this economic class and just reading this book it help me understand more on how the rich know wat they are talkin about, how when it comes to money they are much smatter about it. When reading this book you can actully get alot of useful information out of it that will be able to help you in the furture.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Madonna's 1983 self-titled debut is a classic album. It lacks the depth of her later albums, but for a party, this will get the crowd going better than anything. \\"Holiday\\" has barely aged a day, \\"Burning Up\\" anticipated Madonna's move towards heavier tunes in the 90's, and \\"Everybody\\" plays like early electronica. And as a whole, this album seems much more organic and real, than the polished (and rather bland) 'Like a Virgin'. If you have this and 'The Immaculate Collection,' that's all the pre-'Like a Prayer' Madonna you need.
B000001Y5X|4.0|From start to finish this CD is awsome.  Its not really the Manson that we are used to today (he was still finding himself here) but none the less the man puts on one hell of a show! Its moody, its spooky, and in some parts even a bit of dark humor shows. <br /> <br />So come one, come all! For a glimps of the American life threw Marilyns eyes! <br /> <br />*Best track hands down \\"Lunchbox\\"
B00005J6SZ|2.0|In 1984, Madonna hooked up with the pop svengalis of the day, and made a completely plastic, materialistic, soulless album. And that album was misguidingly titled 'Like a Virgin,' after the excellent hit single that gives the album its two-star rating. Avoid this, or if you must have it, do what I did, and buy the cassette for $1 at a rummage sale. This album is nowhere near the caliber of Madonna's later work. Instead get her underrated debut album.
B000002WPI|5.0|This album is one of the top 5 hip hop albums of all time.. \\"Ready To Die\\", \\"It takes a nation of millions to hold us back\\", \\"All Eyez on Me\\", and \\"The Illmatic\\" are in there too but this album is a lot different from all of those.. The Wu Tang Clan is a group of nine MCs who can ALL rap.. Each member compliments each other perfectley and the feed off each others' energy/rhymes so they are better as a group than as a bunch of solo artists...The RZA's beats are addictive, the rhymes will blow your mind, and the hooks are perfect..

B000002UDB|5.0|This isn't a real Beatles album, but it sure plays better than some of them. This is essentially the five songs from the drug-induced movie of the same name, bundled with the Beatles' three hit singles from 1967, with their B-sides. In essence, this is a hits collection, featuring some of the best singles ever written. Paul's \\"Penny Lane\\" and John's \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" in particular, are both sumptuously orchestrated slices of pop nirvana, but the clear winner here is \\"All You Need Is Love.\\" A must-have for any Beatles, I also suggest this disc to casual fans.
B000268QB2|5.0|If I had read reviews likening Keane to Coldplay I would never have gone near this album. For me, Coldplay are a symptom of the sad state of music today - that such a boring, uninspiring non-event of a band could end up at the top of the commercial heap is out of my comprehension. <br />Luckily, Keane and this album are altogether different. For a start, in Tom Chaplin Keane have a great, versatile voice capable of projecting the songs' abundant emotions with both strength and delicacy. Although quite unique, in different places his singing reminds me of several other good voices such as Morten Harket of A-ha, particularly regarding the range, and mid/late-80s Hugh Cornwell of The Stranglers (the track Untitled I could be that very band from that era). The melodies, bridges and other changes are interesting throughout this CD, and most amazingly for an album today I don't feel the urge to skip any songs. On the contrary, even if I've just enjoyed a favourite and wouldn't mind listening again, I'll wait for the disc to wrap. While obvious influences such as an occassional 80's U2-style piano riff may be present here and there, the band and album have a distinctive sound. <br /> <br />I also like the style of writing/lyric, where the exact meaning isn't clear, leaving the listener to interpret what the song is about.  <br /> <br />To wrap up, this CD has rekindled my hopes for modern music. With a bit of luck the band will cope with success and go from strength to strength with an equally strong follow-up. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005J6T0|3.0|Like many mid-80's albums, Madonna's third album featured a string of excellent singles: the provocative 'Papa Don't Preach,' the excellent dirge 'Live to Tell,' and the Latin-flavored 'La Isla Bonita,' which are all available on 'The Immaculate Collection' disc. I can say for this though, the filler is much better than that on 'Like a Virgin.'
B00005B1W7|5.0|I've read the book it was excellent.  Bought this movie on VHS & was totally into it.  Had seen it on TV in 1974 when it was first aired.  It deals with a difficult time in history with honesty in a sensitive manner without sugar coating the truth.  Am very pleased it is finally out on DVD.  Buy this DVD & enjoy it.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna knew she struck creative gold with 1998's \\"Ray of Light,\\" and in 2000, she decided to tweak the formula ever so slightly, but this time around, she lost it. The cheap production, the cliched lyrics, and Madonna's uninspiring vocals are part of make this album one of her weaker endeavours. The title track meanders on, in what some would call an avant-garde manner, but what I call aimless. \\"I'm So Stupid\\" could be one of her best songs, with live drums, and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" sounds like Simple Plan gave her lyrical advice. But when Madonna strips down, she's at her best. \\"Intervention\\" is probably in the Top 20 Best Madonna songs, while \\"Easy Ride\\" is nothing short of epic. But Madonna seriously needs to ditch electronica and pioneer a new sound, before she loses all relevance.
B00004XMS0|4.0|I know I have already reviewed all four \\"Batman\\" movies individually, but I won't shy away from reviewing this boxed set containing all of them. I actually bought all the films in the boxed set rather than separately, but I decided to review them individually because I was too lazy to write a full review of the boxed set. Tonight, I feel like I'm able to write a thorough review of it, so here goes nothing.<br /><br />\\"Batman\\" (1989, PG-13) The first film in the series was directed by modern day cinema wizard Tim Burton. Michael Keaton takes on the role of the title character and his alter ego Bruce Wayne. In it, the Dark Knight is a vigilante hero out to thwart the criminals that plague Gotham City. The problem is, most of the citizens of Gotham think he's just as bad as the thugs he's beating up. However, their opinion changes when they get a load of the Joker (Jack Nicholson), aka former mobster Jack Napier. The Joker is out to poison Gotham City with his lethal Smilex gas, the same chemical that left him horribly disfigured in a duel with Batman. Meanwhile, Batman's alter ego, millionaire Bruce Wayne, is struggling with his secret life, which gets in the way of his blossoming relationship with beautiful photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), who The Joker also has his eye on. The plot may seem cluttered from a distant point of view, but all the elements mesh together perfectly and the film is excellent.<br /><br />The cast is great. Keaton is the definitive Batman (slightly better than Christian Bale). A lot of people scoffed at him being cast for the role, but their opinion changed when they saw his brilliant performance. Kim Basinger wasn't amazing, but she put in a very good performance. And Jack Nicholson was excellent as The Joker. He doesn't carry the film or steal the show in any means whatsoever, but he portrays the character to the hilt but never overdoes it. This is truly one of his best roles ever. Add to that an outstanding supporting cast that includes Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance, as well as stunning special effects and visuals, and the series is off to a great start. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Batman Returns\\" (1992, PG-13) Three years after the successful first venture, Tim Burtons gets behind the camera again while Michael Keaton dons the cape and tights once more in this brilliant sequel, which is every bit as good as the original. In it, Batman has to face off with not one, not two but three villians. First, there's the Penguin (Danny DeVito), aka Oswald Cobblepot, a grotesque, birdlike man abandoned by his parents as an infant, who has teamed up with crooked businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Together, they plan to get Oswald elected mayor of Gotham and drain the city of its energy supply. And then there's Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), the former Selina Kyle, Shreck's secretary who he supposedly killed after finding out his plan. To make matters worse, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, and Selina have become romantically attracted to each other when they're beating the crap out of each other. This brilliantly written plot culminates in an unforgettable showdown with all four main characters.<br /><br />The cast, like the last one, is flawless. Keaton is once again amazing as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He's even better here than in the first one. Michelle Pfeiffer sizzles as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, exuding sex appeal and putting on a showstopping performance. Danny DeVito was born to play The Penguin by physical features (well, height) alone. But his performance is so convincing that he could be seven feet tall and still put on a great performance. Christopher Walken is great as always. The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle and Michael Gough, who return to their respective roles (Commisioner Gordon and faithful Wayne butler Alfred), as well as cameos by Jan Hooks, Vincent Schiavelli and Paul Reubens that give this film extra kick. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Batman Forever\\" (1995, PG-13) All good thingmust come to an end, and this film proves it. Keaton walked out of it after he was refused a larger salary, and Burton only co-produced this mess. The directing reins were handed over to veteran schlockmeister Joel Schumacher, who stripped away the first two films' gothic elements and turned Gotham City into Camp City. Val Kilmer takes on the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, and plays the role with about as much appeal as a city sidewalk. Nicole Kidman is very pretty but a stiff love interest, Tommy Lee Jones is a terrible Two-Face and Chris O'Donnell is woefully bad as Robin. Jim Carrey plays The Riddler and carries this film on his back. He is the only good actor in this film. Though a little over the top at times, the role is tailor made for him and he is the film's saving grace. 2/5<br /><br />\\"Batman & Robin\\" (1997, PG-13) I don't even want to go into  this mess. Read my individual review. 0/5<br /><br />Should you get this boxed set? Only if you want to be able to buy all the movies in one trip and see how the films' evolution (deevolution?). Otherwise, just buy the first two and go to the movies and see \\"Batman Begins\\".s it. Keaton walked out of it after he was refused a larger salary, and Burton only co-produced this mess.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Keanu Reeves just walking through dialogue while trying to recall \\"Devils Advocate\\" is a polite way to critique this apocoliptic mess. I was bored to tears watching this. The makers must have been counting on the sound engineer to liven this thing up. Alot of swoops and loud annoying noises while everyones voice seems to be at a whisper or above(except for a few ridiculous shouts). Wow the angel Gabriel really made sense, and yes I'm being funny. Possibly some decent computer generated things, but its been done better before, or at least in a better film. A bunch of mish mosh with an even worst ending.
B00005JNJT|4.0|I was just a 7 year old kid when batman forever came out and it was followed by batman and robin. And the fact is that i wasnt old enough to grasp the grotesque direction the series had been steered in to by the release of those two movies. To me the Cartoonish and hi-tech action of the two movies seemed amusing along with how Batman was now being portrayed as more of a happy go lucky crime fighter rather then a \\"dark knight\\". But as i grew older and became more of a comic book fan i realised that those two movies had failed to portray the character accurately. I saw the first two baman movies \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\" to further see how the series had started out really well but was ending up going in a wrong direction. <br /> But this movie changes all that. Batman Begins is everything a batman movie should be. New director Christopher Nolan takes the whole experience of the movie closer to the feel of the comic books, something true fans are bound to appreciate. A darker edgier batman is portrayed by Christian Bale who is probably the best Batman yet. The movie lays emphasis on story and plot rather then stupid cartoonish antics, so if you are one of those people who just expect the action to keep flowing because you are not mature enough to appreciate the storyline then this movie is not for you. Bottom line is all hardcore fans of the comic books will not be dissapointed. There have been many dissapointed fans who have complained about the previous two batman movies, but rest assured there prayers have been answered with this masterpiece
B00000JXVK|5.0|I have looked a long time for this movie. Saw it at the movies  3 times when it first came out and haven't seen it any where since. Any one who loves motorcycle racing will love this movie.
B000001ELR|4.0|Big fan since 75 Dressed to Kill caught my eye in record store. Still love the 70's albums better and the 80's stuff was good but hard to<br />listen to now. the 90's Revenge was good but too much silly dumb down lyrics! I kinda lost the KISS fanatic feeling in 77 and was more<br />into UFO, THIN LIZZY, MOTORHEAD, JUDAS PRIEST, FOGHAT, WHITESNAKE, RAMONES, CHEAP TRICK, SCORPIONS ETC..<br />and though I still bought their albums and went to their concerts by the time Unmasked came out I was almost done. Creatures was<br />the first and only METAL album. The title track and Gene's I love it loud was enough to make me see them 5x's on that tour. i still<br />have my t shirt and coins from the mardi gras show in NO at the superdome. Carr and Vincent brought energy and a real rock sound<br />back to the band. Too bad they lost it in the 80's with some of the pop radio stuff they put out. They should have kept this sound.<br />and the makeup. Anyway the album is not without it's flaws and Stanley's songs hold up some of Simmons's are just okay! But the<br />playing of Carr and Vincent make this a must have for KISS and METAL fans! Creatures was one of their best albums still is!<br />it's certainly better than the last album MONSTER! which is only KISS album I can't listen to except Simmon's Wall of Sound.

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Burn has to be one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded<br /><br />and still rocks! David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes made a nice<br /><br />combination. Burn is a rock classic. From the opening chord<br /><br />it's just \\"burns\\" all the way. The playing is just awesome.<br /><br />If your a fan of hard rock or Whitesnake you will love this!<br /><br />Highly recommended*********10 stars.
B0007P3582|5.0|That review above mine is just some crap written by some poser with no taste. 50 Cent is just as good as all those old \\"musicians\\" that you cherish. People give him crap because he can't read or write muzak. Even more people give him crap because he can't read or write. I've heard posers come out with garbage like \\"he merely exploits his image and shallow agenda because he wants money\\" and \\"his songs are retarded enough to allow him daily access to a wheelchair\\" etc etc etc. But I have one question for you. How many times have your precious \\"musicians\\" been shot? Everybody needs to remember that muzak quality (espeically in the case of rappers who the greatest musicians of them all) is based on the toughness. How many times has Beethoven been shot? Or Miles Davis? Or that poser with the violin? Exactly. Speaking of Beethoven, I don't know why people give him credit just because he made a bit of music when he was deaf. If you want a great musician with disabilities then go for 50 Cent.
6304077939|1.0|The only useful comment I have found on this section is the one of the viewer who smashed the tape after the cat scene. <br />Without that scene, the movie would just be a boring and meaningless string of unconnected episodes, with no use other of entertaining a bunch of intellectuals who dwelve on terms such as \\"poetic\\", \\"beautiful\\" and \\"troubled genius\\". <br />Then you reach the scene of the cat, which makes blood boil (at least of any person who has a bit of humanity). <br />I would like to tell the reader who intelligently comments on \\"Philistines who watch art film and then get all self-righteous about the gritty bits\\" that I prefer to be a Philistine than a stuck up, posh intellectual who confuses torture with art. Probably next time I'll rent Disney, be sure it won't be Lauzon. I will steer clear of any movie that you will regard as \\"wonderful\\".
B0009KA7BS|2.0|Yes there were some good effects and wild looking creatures, some decent ideas, a handful of good acting, but where the hell was the story? How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending.
B000000H42|5.0|back in the mid-80's, the underground black metal scene was pretty scarce, except for these intense, dark individuals. this is one of the best albums to come out on Roadrunner records in the 80's, and in my opinion, better than any of King Diamond's albums included. this is a classic album in the realm of black metal or just heavy metal period. and I'd also like to comment to that jerk who posted a review for this album with the negative rating. King's voice is an aquired taste. you might not be into the falsetto range of singing but don't disrespect this classic album because of your obnoxious rudeness. you mentioned Judas Priest as being \\"real metal\\" compared to Mercyful Fate. well, I've heard many Judas Priest songs where Rob Halford lets out some high-pitched shrieks that don't sound too different than the ones that come from King Diamond's pipes. and even if you don't dig King's voice (which I do), I think the music more than makes up for the vocals.
B000002AS3|5.0|Oasis finally released their debut album \\"Definitely Maybe\\" in August of 1994, and what a triumphant debut it is.  Oasis had already been kicking around for a quite a while before this album came out--terrific early songs such as the scorching \\"Take Me\\" and the hauntingly desperate \\"Colour My Life\\" remain officially unreleased although they've been much bootlegged.  Noel Gallagher worked painstakingly to get \\"Definitely Maybe\\" just right, reportedly having the band record the whole album three times due to dissatisfaction.  Looking beyond all the hype, tabloid coverage, and so forth, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is truly a superb and timeless album that deserved to be a smash hit, which it was.  Much has been made of the derivative nature of Oasis' music--'borrowing' the T. Rex \\"Bang A Gong\\" riff for \\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\\"; ripping off that Coca-Cola jingle for \\"Shakermaker\\"--but the thing is, this truly sounds like an album that should take the world by storm.  The production here is phenomenal--with crisp and booming drums, rich guitar tones, and Liam Gallagher's frequently sneering vocals, song after song jumps out at you and captivates with a uniquely huge and bracing sound.  Noel seems to be tapping into a variety of British influences, from the Beatles, Stones, Who, and Kinks, all the way through the likes of the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Spaceman 3, and My Bloody Valentine.  The music hall-flavored \\"Digsy's Diner\\" and the album-closing acoustic ballad \\"Married With Children\\" are fun and enjoyable songs that mix things up a bit.  As for the rest of the songs, each and every one is a gem.  The contemplative \\"Live Forever\\" and the passionately yearning \\"Slide Away\\" are soaring rock 'ballads'. \\"Supersonic\\" and the uptempo \\"Bring It On Down\\" are edgy rockers. \\"Up In The Sky\\" is a blissful, psychedelic-tinged feel-good song. \\"Columbia\\" is an infectious, relentlessly rocking groove-tune.  \\"Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" and \\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\\" are enthusiastic, celebratory rockers.\\"Shakermaker\\", which does bear resemblance to the Beatles instrumental \\"Flying\\", uncannily incorporates that Coca-Cola melody into a 12-bar blues format and adds a soaring bridge.  Noel's lead guitar work is terrific--although his playing isn't technically virtuosic by any means, Noel is a master of 'serving the songs' and knowing just what notes to play for maximum impact, plus having such great guitar tone doesn't hurt--just check out the extended song-ending solo on \\"Bring It On Down\\", the blazing leads on \\"Columbia\\", or the long fade on \\"Slide Away\\" for proof. Granted, there's not a whole heck of a lot of variety here in terms of arrangement--it's pretty much guitars-cranked-up-to-11 on song after song--but what a great sound.      I think most serious music listeners have a handful or so of albums that had that 'life changing' impact that marks a turning point of sorts in their lives--\\"Definitely Maybe\\" definitely had that impact on me when I first bought and played it back in March of '95, and it still sounds great all these years later.  No doubt about it, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is a must-have album.    (P.S.  I do want to point out the Japanese CD version which slips in two more great songs--the rocking \\"Cloudburst\\" and the Noel-sung acoustic ballad \\"Sad Song\\"--while keeping the rest of the track listing intact and in the same order.  \\"Sad Song\\" can be found on the Japanese \\"Don't Go Away\\" CD single but with an unfortunate 'sudden ending' (admittedly a minor gripe), making the Japanese \\"Definitely Maybe\\" version preferrable.  \\"Cloudburst\\" can also be found on the \\"Live Forever\\" UK CD single.)
0440234743|4.0|I usually read mysteries and tend to steer clear of courtroom dramas, so I had my doubts about reading this book, but I was delightfully surprised.     \\"The Testament\\" tells of a self-made billionaire who dies and, because he despises all of his deadbeat heirs, leaves his entire eleven billion dollar estate to his illegitimate daughter, who works as a missionary ministering Christianity to a primitive tribe on the banks of the Pantenal River in Brazil. Nate O'Riley, a litigator for the law firm that represents the late billionaire (and also a recovering alcoholic and drug addict), is assigned the task of locating her and informing her of the situation. Of course, because she lives with the tribe in a feral part of the jungle, finding her will not be an easy task, and it sets O'Riley on a path to personal redemption.    Though it can be a little slow-moving at times, my advice is to bear with this story and you will not be disappointed by the resolution. It's an extremely beautiful tale of redemption, and how all the riches of the world can't compare to the wealth of eternity.
B00004LMAH|5.0|Released in February of 2000 after a bit of a hiatus and with Paul Arthurs and Paul McGuigan both gone, \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" finds Noel Gallagher determined to re-invent Oasis. Quite frankly, he didn't really succeed (as Noel would be the first to admit), but that doesn't mean this album is a failure. There are some mild techno/ electronica flavorings to be found, plus some gospel-like backing vocals on a few tracks, but realistically, for the most part \\"...Giants\\" wholeheartedly embraces the trademark Oasis sound. Furthermore, you can hear a lot of traces of previous Oasis songs on here--notice the choruses on \\"Who Feels Love?\\", the chord progression is a carbon copy of the chorus from \\"Hey Now!\\"; \\"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\\" is strikingly similar to \\"(I Got) The Fever\\"; and the riff-rocker \\"I Can See A Liar\\" seems to incorporate snippets/ pieces from at least a handful of previous Oasis songs. All that said, this is still a great album. Liam Gallagher gets his first songwriting credit on an Oasis release with the amusing yet heart-tuggingly earnest and charming 3-chord power ballad \\"Little James\\". Apart from that, Noel's once again running the show, often filling in on bass as well, and he's got lots to offer. \\"Go Let It Out\\" is a great rousing anthem. The haunting and explosive \\"Gas Panic!\\" is intense and cathartic. \\"Roll It Over\\" has arrestingly dreamy verses, forceful Liam vocals, & a flawlessly-executed \\"Come Together\\"-ish guitar solo. The moody \\"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\\" sounds a tad forced with Noel's cameo vocal appearance toward the end, but otherwise it's a great surging rocker, as is the raging \\"I Can See A Liar\\". Noel sings lead on two songs--\\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\" isn't a bad song, although it does sound startlingly generic for Oasis; \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" is a little rote and melodramatic, but it's still strong, and again, has an arresting dream-like atmosphere. The Eastern-flavored \\"Who Feels Love?\\" is marred by anannoying loop, but overall it's pretty great and has excellent vocal harmonies.    This Japanese version of the album adds the soaring, powerful, somewhat otherworldly-sounding anthem \\"Let's All Make Believe\\" as the final track.  \\"Let's All Make Believe\\" is also available as the b-side to the \\"Go Let It Out\\" UK CD single, as well as on a bonus disc that was included in supposedly \\"limited edition\\" pressings of the album in the US.  Ironically, \\"Let's All Make Believe\\", along with another b-side \\"One Way Road\\", sound more like an extention into exciting new territory for Oasis than most of the remaining tracks on the actual album.    I do feel that \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" is weaker than each of Oasis' preceeding albums, but like I said, this is still a great album, and it certainly doesn't deserve the mind-boggling negativity that it has received by many fans.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Keanu Reeves will undoubtedly never win an Academy Award for acting. That is actually a shame, because I think he delivers some really great performances. He's not as annoyingly flashy as Tom Cruise, as oddly lovable as Tom Hanks, or as physically expressive as Brad Pitt, but Reeves plays his characters as extensions of himself (which, by the way, as an actor myself, is the only way any human being can actually play a role) and his own internalization of his emotions. Reeves' eyes tell the story, not his face. The way he might hold his head provides you insight that another actor might display on his face. <br /> <br />All that said, Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine is as unique as his character of Jack Traven (Speed) was. (While I love the first Matrix, I was sorely disappointed by the director's vision and delivery of the sequels). Reeves delivers a great performance in Constantine. <br /> <br />John Constantine has always been tortured by the gift of seeing the evil that lurks just outside of the vision of most all other humans. When it became too much for him as a teenager, he committed suicide. He was brought back 2 minutes later, empowered with the ability to return \\"halfbreed\\" demons to Hell when they overstepped their boundaries. Unfortunately, he was also damned to hell for having committed suicide. Constantine continues to protect humans from the half breed demons in an effort to save his own soul. <br /> <br />With really cool sets and a script that keeps you guessing (with the exception of the ending), Constantine delivers a moody and surreal landscape for this world and that of hell. The demons are unique but not particularly scary. The scary stuff is the Biblical references. <br /> <br />This is based on a comic from Vertigo (DC) Comics. It's a dark film and I can only suppose that the comic was equally so. <br /> <br />I think the script was very engaging and tight up until the end. The ending of the film seems to take the easy way out. Whereas we see Constantine perform a painful and drawn out <br />exorcism early on, the final exorcism - with ostensibly a far more powerful demon - takes place relatively quickly and easily. <br /> <br />I love Tilda Swinton (wonderful as usual) as the angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Lucifer (though his performance was not so much evil as it was weirdly silly). Rachel Weitz was really interesting as the female lead. She made me completely forget her forgettable performance in The Mummy. <br /> <br />I also particularly loved the \\"move ins\\" to Weitz's character that Reeves does on several occasions. Watch the film and you'll see what i'm talking about. <br /> <br />This is not your standard fare - but it is not a rip off of The Exorcist or any other film (though it may share some similarity with Prophecy). Far more engaging than the Order or any other film of that nature, Constantine is leaps and bounds above those other films. It is due to a decent director, but really good performances by Reeves, Weitz and Swinton and an awesome set designer and cinematographer. <br /> <br />May not be everyone's cup of tea - but if you give it a chance you'll like it.

Rex \\"Bang A Gong\\" riff for \\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\\"; ripping off that Coca-Cola jingle for \\"Shakermaker\\"--but the thing is, this truly sounds like an album that should take the world by storm.  The production here is phenomenal--with crisp and booming drums, rich guitar tones, and Liam Gallagher's frequently sneering vocals, song after song jumps out at you and captivates with a uniquely huge and bracing sound.  Noel seems to be tapping into a variety of British influences, from the Beatles, Stones, Who, and Kinks, all the way through the likes of the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Spacemen 3, and My Bloody Valentine.  The music hall-flavored \\"Digsy's Diner\\" and the album-closing acoustic ballad \\"Married With Children\\" are fun and enjoyable songs that mix things up a bit. As for the rest of the songs, each and every one is a gem. The contemplative \\"Live Forever\\" and the passionately yearning \\"Slide Away\\" are soaring rock 'ballads'. \\"Supersonic\\" and the uptempo \\"Bring It On Down\\" are edgy rockers. \\"Up In The Sky\\" is a blissful, psychedelic-tinged feel-good song. \\"Columbia\\" is an infectious, relentlessly rocking groove-tune. \\"Rock 'n' Roll Star\\" and \\"Cigarettes & Alcohol\\" are enthusiastic, celebratory rockers. \\"Shakermaker\\", which does bear resemblance to the Beatles instrumental \\"Flying\\", uncannily incorporates that Coca-Cola melody into a 12-bar blues format and adds a soaring bridge.  Noel's lead guitar work is terrific--although his playing isn't technically virtuosic by any means, Noel is a master of 'serving the songs' and knowing just what notes to play for maximum impact, plus having such great guitar tone doesn't hurt--just check out the extended song-ending solo on \\"Bring It On Down\\", the blazing leads on \\"Columbia\\", or the long fade on \\"Slide Away\\" for proof.  Granted, there's not a whole heck of a lot of variety here in terms of arrangement--it's pretty much guitars-cranked-up-to-11 on song after song--but what a great sound.      This Japanese release additionally sweetens the pot by adding two additional gems not on the standard UK & US releases--\\"Cloudburst\\" blatantly rips off \\"Standing Here\\" by the Stone Roses, but it's a great rocker anyway; and \\"Sad Song\\" is a moving acoustic ballad sung by Noel.  True, \\"Cloudburst\\" is also on the \\"Live Forever\\" UK CD single; however, the version of \\"Sad Song\\" on the Japanese CD single of \\"Don't Go Away\\", although otherwise identical, has an unfortunate 'sudden ending'--the version here has a more proper and fitting ending making it preferrable.    I think most serious music listeners have a handful or so of albums that had that 'life changing' impact that marks a turning point of sorts in their lives--\\"Definitely Maybe\\" definitely had that impact on me when I first bought and played it back in March of '95, and it still sounds great all these years later.  No doubt about it, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is a must-have album.
B0000028RR|5.0|I've noticed some reviewers here critiquing Rage's music and particularly their message, simply because it's \\"hypocritical\\". I'd impart these words from Tom Morello (the guitarist of RATM): <br /> <br />\\"A lot of labels contacted us, and lots of them just didn't seem to understand what we wanted to do. They kept talking about the message of the music as a gimmick. They were interested in us just because there was a buzz... They saw us as the latest local rock band to be hyped. But Epic agreed to everything we asked--and they've followed through... we never saw a conflict as long as we maintained creative control. When you live in a capitalistic society, the currency of the dissemination of information goes through capitalistic channels. Would Noam Chomsky object to his works being sold at Barnes & Noble? No, because that's where people buy their books. We're not interested in preaching to just the converted. It's great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists, but it's also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from Granada Hills to Stuttgart.\\" <br /> <br />This band opened up the door for every other rap/rock ripoff, but actually had a message rather than self-indulgently nihilistic ranting (Korn) or adolescent posturing (Limp Bizkit). Highly recommended album, one of the best debuts in history.
B00004R960|5.0|Released in February of 2000 after a bit of a hiatus and with Paul Arthurs and Paul McGuigan both gone, \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" finds Noel Gallagher determined to re-invent Oasis. Quite frankly, he didn't really succeed (as Noel would be the first to admit), but that doesn't mean this album is a failure. There are some mild techno/ electronica flavorings to be found, plus some gospel-like backing vocals on a few tracks, but realistically, for the most part \\"...Giants\\" wholeheartedly embraces the trademark Oasis sound. Furthermore, you can hear a lot of traces of previous Oasis songs on here--notice the choruses on \\"Who Feels Love?\\", the chord progression is a carbon copy of the chorus from \\"Hey Now!\\"; \\"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\\" is strikingly similar to \\"(I Got) The Fever\\"; and the riff-rocker \\"I Can See A Liar\\" seems to incorporate snippets/ pieces from at least a handful of previous Oasis songs. All that said, this is still a great album. Liam Gallagher gets his first songwriting credit on an Oasis release with the amusing yet heart-tuggingly earnest and charming 3-chord power ballad \\"Little James\\". Apart from that, Noel's once again running the show, often filling in on bass as well, and he's got lots to offer. \\"Go Let It Out\\" is a great rousing anthem. The haunting and explosive \\"Gas Panic!\\" is intense and cathartic. The album-closer \\"Roll It Over\\" has arrestingly dreamy verses, forceful Liam vocals, & a flawlessly-executed \\"Come Together\\"-ish guitar solo. The moody \\"Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is\\" sounds a tad forced with Noel's cameo vocal appearance toward the end, but otherwise it's a great surging rocker, as is the raging \\"I Can See A Liar\\". Noel sings lead on two songs--\\"Where Did It All Go Wrong?\\" isn't a bad song, although it does sound startlingly generic for Oasis; \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" is a little rote and melodramatic, but it's still strong, and again, has an arresting dream-like atmosphere. The Eastern-flavored \\"Who Feels Love?\\" is marred by an annoying loop, but overall it's pretty great and has excellent vocal harmonies. <br /> <br />I think some listeners were expecting this album to sound more different and uncharacteristic of Oasis than it does.  It's worth mentioning that 2 of the b-sides from the \\"...Giants\\" era--\\"Let's All Make Believe\\" and \\"One Way Road\\"--sound more like an extention into exciting new territory for Oasis than most of the tracks on the actual album; perhaps Noel simply felt these two tracks didn't fit in on here, hence their b-side status. One wonders this even more since \\"Let's All Make Believe\\" was on a bonus disc that was included in supposedly \\"limited edition\\" pressings of the album. <br /> <br />I do feel that \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" is weaker than each of Oasis' preceeding albums, but like I said, this is still a great album, and it certainly doesn't deserve the mind-boggling negativity that it has received by many fans.  <br /> <br />(P.S.  Don't let the fact that \\"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants\\" was released in this \\"clean version\\" give you the wrong idea--the only swearing on the album is provided by samples from the movie \\"Message To Love--The Isle Of Wight Festival\\" on the otherwise instrumental opening track \\"F***in' In The Bushes\\".)
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Best Thrash Album I have heard since South of Heaven !!!!!!
B000002C25|5.0|Released in August of 1997, Oasis' 3rd album \\"Be Here Now\\" has been much maligned over the years, not just by critics and fans, but by Noel Gallagher himself, which is a real shame because this is actually a great album that finds Oasis embracing their strengths wholeheartedly.  One highly noticeable difference with \\"Be Here Now\\" is that Oasis dropped that late '60s-style reverb-heavy sound that's so prominent on tracks like \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\".  Oasis' huge sound had already been in full force on \\"Definitely Maybe\\" and to a lesser extent \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\", but Noel wanted to take this a step further yet--the clear goal with \\"Be Here Now\\" was to make a huge, sweeping, epic rock & roll album, and regardless of what Noel may say, they succeeded beyond all belief.  Noel wrote all the songs on \\"Be Here Now\\"; he has confessed that certain songs here had been written prior to the first album \\"Definitely Maybe, but frankly, that's just a further testament to the mass quantity of great songs he had at his disposal in his songbook.  Seriously, Noel Gallagher was 27 years old when \\"Definitely Maybe\\" came out in August of 1994, and it's an easy guess that he'd been doing plenty of songwriting before that time, so it makes sense he had a lot of material at hand considering his level of songwriting talent.  Song after song on \\"Be Here Now\\" has ultra-catchy hooks, and the album's extremely dense sound gives the album an all-encompassing feel, not unlike George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\", and this sound really works wonders here. Don't get the wrong idea that the huge sound of \\"Be Here Now\\" is indicative of it being music to knuckleheadedly chant along to in big arenas; think more along the lines of \\"Hey Jude\\"--the anthemic feel is mostly genuine, and there really is depth here. I want to point out that the lyrics here are actually far more sincere and emotional than a lot of people would lead you to believe--it's not just a bunch of obvious hippy-dippy rhyming of the kind that John Power from Cast specialized in, just to make a comparison. Oasis don't rush through things here, and that's another positive aspect--most of the songs are fittingly taken at that 'laidback Oasis tempo', and the album's pacing is masterful, using extended intros and outtros to sort of ease you along.  Apart from Noel's excellent feature on \\"Magic Pie\\", it's Liam Gallagher on lead vocals for all of the songs, and his rough-around-the-edges vocals are superb--always convicing and carrying a great deal of emotional weight.  To name a handful of the terrific songs here, there the anthemic \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\"; the rip-roaring high-speed rocker \\"My Big Mouth\\"; the wistful \\"Magic Pie\\"; the cautionary, Allman Brothers-ish, roadhouse blues-flavored \\"Fade In-Out\\"; and the rousing, uplifting rocker \\"It's Getting Better (Man!!)\\".  I'm not going to say that the album NEVER goes at all overboard--I won't argue that it was really necessary to include a reprise of \\"All Around The World\\" when the song itself is already over 9 minutes long, and the jokey, out-of-place tacked-on ending of \\"Magic Pie\\" sounds foolish.  \\"Stand By Me\\" does have a little bridge section that very briefly pushes the song into melodramatic territory, but otherwise it's a wonderfully bittersweet power ballad with a singalong chorus.  \\"All Around The World\\" does have some admittedly hokey lyrics, but the enormous build-up really gets under your skin.  The title track and the uptempo \\"I Hope, I Think, I Know\\" are a lot of fun as well, and \\"Don't Go Away\\" is a lovely tender ballad with a refreshingly stripped-down coda.  Regardless of how derivative Oasis may be, they really did hit upon a great distinctive signature sound which is heard in all of its glory on \\"Be Here Now\\", a genuine '90s masterpiece.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since A Rush of Blood to the head three years ago in 2002. That album changed my life. I listened to it solidly for the whole of those three years. I think it may have left my stereo three-CD changer a total of 2 times in the entirety of my ownership. Yes, I purchased Parachutes as well, and love it too, but A Rush of Blood to the Head was the love of my musical life.  <br /> <br />So, it goes without saying that when Coldplay's 18-months-in-the-making, most-anticipated, the album-of-albums X&Y came out, I was expecting to have my brain explode, my eyes fall out of my head and other such gruesome sensations one might experience during listening to an awe-inspiring album. (At least for me...) <br /> <br />Well, I was severely disappointed.  <br /> <br />The only songs that really stood out upon first listen were, oddly enough, we the first and last tracks: (unless you count the bonus track of \\"Kingdom Come\\" as the last track) the spacey, tempo-changing opener of \\"Square One\\" and the sliding, guitar drenched, angry social commentary of \\"Twisted Logic\\".  <br /> <br />But, after maybe... five listens, I came to really enjoy and appreciate this album. And with each listen, it just keeps getting better. Warning: this album is a grower.  <br /> <br />I was pretty stupid to think that this new album could completely replace A Rush of Blood to the Head and it's importance to me in one fell swoop. But, now, after a month of listening, I think it just may fill the role. <br /> <br />The layering and instrumentation in this album is a show of true musicianship. Everything, every part has a purpose and is integrated into the piece of music seamlessly, until all the tracks on the album almost come alive with their richness. Some people maybe through off by the consistent density of this album, but others may embrace it, basking in the warm glow of musical genius. Not a note is misplaced in any song. Some people may point to this as being a flaw, as it erases human frailty from song making, but I find it as simple craftsmanship. So what if I can't hear the peddle-workings like you can in \\"Politik\\" (The crashing, epic opener of the last album)? I was never aware that peddle-workings were imperative in order to make a good album.  <br /> <br />But I digress. A song-by-song review by yours truly: <br /> <br />The opener of \\"X&Y\\", \\"Square One\\", is a much different introduction into this new album than \\"Politik\\", an opener whose very introduction was enough to blow anyone off their seats, crashing and falling like a tidal wave. \\"Square One\\", however starts out much more quietly, with a simple guitar, shimmering through some spacey synths until Martin's haunting tenor breaks through, almost uncertainly, with \\"You're in control, is there anyway you want to go?/ You're in control is there anything you want to know?/ The  future's for discovering/ The space in which we travel in\\". Cueing Will Champion, Coldplay's drummer, to come in with a staccato cymbal and simply *cool* drum riff before the song explodes into guitar and bass, Chris' voice echoing with lines like \\"From the top of the first page/ to the end of the last day\\" and \\"I need a compass, draw me a map/ I'm on the top I can't get back\\". The entire song is littered with extra little sound affects, a galloping drum affect and some amazing backing vocals that you may miss if you're not careful. The song comes to a grinding halt with the synths fading out around you, the galloping growing farther off and a soft, acoustic guitar hailing in Chris with \\"You wonder if your chance will ever come/ Or if you're stuck in square one\\". <br /> <br />After such a cathartic rocker about universal humanity and emotional inertia, the band throws you for a loop with the heart-broken ballad of \\"What If\\", starting off with Chris and his piano singing \\"What if there was no light? / Nothing wrong, nothing right?\\". The song's lyrics of insecurity and almost paranoia may throw off some, but doubts are quickly put to rest by Martin's broken voice and simple piano. Nothing obtuse. Nothing pretentious. Nothing Chicago *wink*. But then, that's what we love about this band isn't it? The song flows into a chorus with the band at full swing, Jonny, lead guitarist, provides a shiny guitar part that proves perfect accompaniment to Chris' \\"Ooo's\\" in the higher register. The band continues with full accompaniment for the rest of the song, until the wheels fall off the wagon and they go hurtling into an almost raucous crescendo that falls to silence, leaving the listener quite exhausted. But that's a good thing. ;) <br /> <br />The band leaves the piano behind for yet another song, and one of my personal favorites, \\"White Shadows\\". From first note, you know that this is not going to be any *normal* Coldplay song. The song is set over a syncopated rhythm, the drum, guitar and bass parts all seemingly entirely different, but working too well together in order for anyone with a working set of ears NOT to be impressed. Chris provides his usual pristine vocals, belting a chorus of \\"Maybe you'll get what you wanted/ Maybe you'll stumble upon it\\" upon a backdrop of some very impressive backing vocals. The song ends on nothing but some stadium synths/organs and Chris singing out, \\"Swim out in a sea of faces/ Tide of the human races/ An answer now is what I need/ See it in the new sun rising/ See it break on your horizon/ Come on love/ Stay with me\\" that leaves chills up your spine. <br /> <br />And just when you think Coldplay has out-done themselves, they travel on to \\"Fix You\\", recently being declared as Coldplay's greatest, and also, as openly stated by the band, one of their favorites they have ever written. Opening on some churchy organs, Chris comes in with \\"You get what you want, but not what you need\\". During the opening verses, other sounds join in, such as an extra organ sound, some simple strokes on a piano, some bass and a quiet acoustic guitar. Everything is going quite nicely until Jonny breaks in with a soaring guitar and Will with a building cymbal, until the drummer makes the song absolutely take flight by crashing into a part that sounds too complicated to be possible for two hands and feet (but apparently it is, upon seeing live performances). The band, after lapsing into mental stalling at the sheer beauty of what they have just created (or at least that would be what would happen to me) come in, all four members harmonizing perfectly over lines like \\"Tears stream down your face/ When you lose something you can't replace\\" and \\"Tears stream down your face/ And I...\\" until all goes quiet and we descend back to earth with Chris and piano singing \\"Lights will guide you home...\\"  <br /> <br />And, after having survived that little number, the band jumps in with guns blazing as the first, echo-y guitar notes are delivered through a fog of synths, announcing \\"Talk\\". The riff, lifted from Krafwerk's \\"Computer Love\\", is what makes this song so good. It's almost like you can't get enough of it. Chris carries us through it all with \\"You can climb a ladder up to the sun/ or write a song nobody has sung\\". The song quiets down, leaving us with synths and Will playing a little jig on his hit-hats before adding in the bass and Chris' piano until giving way to a fast, sheer genius guitar part, until an impatient crash on Will's drums announces a heavy, sawing guitar, bringing Chris back in with the chorus. The song ends with what sounds like a plane landing, but strangely fits with what the listener may feel like after listening to this gem.  <br /> <br />After this, the band makes the listener sit up in their seats when a chorus of strings comes in and Chris wasting no time coming in with \\"Trying hard to speak/ And fighting with my weak hand\\" as the title track \\"X&Y\\" starts up. After Chris gives some quiet chords upon his piano, deep bass drums come in as well as some serious guitar, melting into growing violins. The chorus givesthe illusion of floating or flying, which is quite amazing considering the actual chorus is \\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave\\". These words glide among a bright guitar part until giving way to a guitar solo that leaves you salivating. Amongst \\"ooo's\\" from Chris, the song comes to a short-lived end, a symphony of strings carrying you over to the next tack.  <br /> <br />\\"Speed of Sound\\", Coldplay's newest single, may seem like a rehashing of the \\"Clocks\\" formula to some people, but to me, it is the formula and only the formal. The song opens with a stark, hypnotizing piano riff floating amongst some synths, before Will's new-found love of bass drums kicks in to allow the first verse of \\"How long before I get in?/ Before it starts? Before I begin?\\", followed by a soaring reintroduction of the piano among a grinding guitar, the next verse being followed with guitar and bass, until the chorus breaks into Will's bass drums and then rockets up and then comes hurtling back down to the piano. The last line, held out blood-vessel-bursting-ly long by Martin, leaves the listener's bones liquefied, twitching for the next song as a static-y synths leads you on to track number 8. <br /> <br />\\"A Message\\" opens with a strumming of an acoustic guitar and \\"My song is love/ Love to the loveless shown\\". If you thought that actually saying the word \\"love\\" in a song was musically taboo in a love song and would automatically cause you to be laughed at, think again. Martin manages to make believers out of all of us once again by his simple sincerity and straightforwardness of this song. The first verse melts into the chorus when a second guitar and drums join Chris in \\"I'm not going to take it back/ I'm not going to say I don't mean that\\". The second verse comes in with an added electric guitar part that shifts like a wandering moth from speaker to speaker that makes for quite a cool effect. The song breaks for a guitar solo, Chris coming back in and causing the rest of the band to drop out with his heartfelt \\"And I love you please come home\\" until finally ending with a few strums of the guitar and some chords on the piano and an \\"And I've got to get that message home\\". <br /> <br />The guys lurch you out of ballad-dom again as \\"Low\\" comes at you, guitar soaring, bass rumbling and drums crashing. It all falls to Chris' feet as he sings \\"You see the world in black and white/ No color, no light\\" amongst bass and a truly cool guitar part that is nearly left unheard it is so ambient. The chorus comes through though with the same speediness as the intro with, \\"All you ever wanted to be/ Living in perfect symmetry\\". One thing that might be most distinctive about this song to most listeners is the \\"spoon\\" part provided by Mr. Champion. The \\"spoons\\" turn out to be wine glasses and, after a few listens, one cannot imagine the song without them. Martin proves his mastery of his falsetto and his superiority of being able to slide up and down the scale as easily as he were blinking, with the line \\"You should try\\". But just when you think this song is done surprising you, the band lurches into a key-change that would be the demise to most other songs, but Coldplay holds up once again, sawing away at their guitars as Chris \\"Oooh\\"s and \\"'Cause I feel low\\"s and even provides a 80s hair band salute to the falsetto screech. but instead of the listener wanting to set their stereo on fire, it simply compels them to fashion a closet altar to this man.  <br /> <br />The band morphs back into mellowness as \\"The Hardest Part\\" is introduced through a bouncy guitar and cheery piano and Chris singing \\"And the hardest part was letting go/ Not taking part\\". This song is one of the bumps in an otherwise spotless album. The lyrics are a bit too sugary for my tastes, but it does grow on you after awhile. The guitar slides in with new parts throughout the song that do keep it interesting, but I often find myself pressing \\"Skip\\" when this song moves up. Although, it does have a good ending, a catchy guitar and full band accompaniment fading into... <br /> <br />\\"Swallowed in the Sea\\". This song opens with only Chris \\"You cut me down a tree/ And brought it back to me\\". The melody is really quite addicting and you can't help but singing along on only your second listen. The guitar gives a long, winging note, opening up for an acoustic, bass and drums. The chorus is set upon a really great guitar part and the refrain is carried on the band's \\"Ooo\\"s and \\"Ahh\\"s. The last few lines of this song may have to screaming until you're blue in the face with the passion that Chris sings \\"Oh, what good is it to live/ With nothing left to give? / Forget but not forgive/ Not loving all you see?\\" The song halts as Chris leaves us with \\"You belong with me/ Not swallowed in the sea\\" as he provides some chords on the piano. <br /> <br />And then, upon a bed of strings, synths and ambient guitar, Chris is carried singing \\"Sunlight opened up my eyes/ To see for the first time\\" to pull you into the closer \\"Twisted Logic\\". The band comes in with some slow-moving piano, guitar, bass and cymbals until backing off to allow Chris to sing \\"Hundreds of years in the future/ There could be computers/ Looking for life on earth\\" while Jonny provides spouts of sound from his guitar that rather sound like he's hitting it with a hammer, only adding to the dark color of this song. The whole band climbs in again, providing a teaser for what's to come as Chris shouts, \\"You'll go backwards, but then/ You'll go forwards again\\". Jonny provides us with a nice riff until we are immersed back into the murky social commentary of track 12. And finally, on a sea of winging guitars and an impossibly long note on Martin's part, the song inspires the listener to successfully punch something before all the groaning of the guitars is literally SWALLOWED up by some unseen force and you are left with 30 seconds of recovery time before the next song starts. <br /> <br />\\"Kingdom Come\\", the album's not-so-hidden hidden track, proves to be an enjoyable bonus, but can't really compare to the others on the album. The guitar part and Chris' lyrics of \\"Still my heart and hold my tongue\\" do make for a good listen. The addition of the piano and harmonica are nice touches and the song ends on a beautiful note of \\"Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me\\". <br /> <br />In conclusion: an excellent album that only needs some time to grow.  <br /> <br />And on another note, this album is at it's best when playing over headphones or on \\"Max\\" on your stereo. There's really no other way to listen to it.  <br /> <br />~panda

B0000ACY0Y|5.0|As a Gene Clark fan from the Byrds period, the \\"Gene Clark and the Gosdins\\" album failed to live up to my expectations at the time: I missed the jangly 12 string Rickenbacker and the more rock driven sensibility behind the classic \\"Feel a Whole Lot Better.\\" I found it way too demanding then to reappraise the artist within a solo context and turned my listening attention instead toward \\"Younger than Yesterday.\\"<br /><br />By 1972 I was ready to try again when I purchased the \\"Gene Clark Collector Series: Early L.A. Sessions.\\" I was feeling nostalgic for the era, a feeling exacerbated by the release of Lenny Kaye's \\"Nuggets.\\" Still rather put off by the laid back country material, I discovered vestiges of that brooding poetic genius in songs such as \\"The Same One\\" and \\"I Found You.\\" That record stayed in my collection until, by 1991, I bought the \\"Echoes\\" CD. The acoustic version of \\"So You Say You Lost Your Baby\\" really impressed me. This, along with the studio version of the tune, with its awesome string arrangement by Leon Russell, enhanced my burgeoning reaffirmation of the man, his music and legacy.<br /><br />  Finally,  I happened to come across a copy of  \\"No Other\\" listed as a reissue of his long lost masterpiece. Upon first hearing the record, I felt a sense of closure in such songs as \\"Strength of Strings\\" and \\"No Other.\\" What he alluded to in his scatter blot imagery of \\"So You Say You Lost Your Baby,\\" a musical tale told in a little over two minutes, now seemed reconfigured into a definitive musical statement.<br /><br />  The eight songs for me represent a kind of interlocking tone poem. Each song, like the \\"notes that roll on winds/with swirling wings,\\" segues into the next as naturally as our moods change according to circumstance. Each song is distinct, a world unto itself, yet finds itself somehow linked to the others by the finest of threads. From \\"Life's Greatest Fool\\" to \\"Lady of the North\\" Clark brings a deceptively simple yet elegant humanity into the emotional texture of his work. He sings of life's extremes, fraught with anger and disappointment as \\"Some Misunderstanding,\\" the sorrowful polarities of relationship in \\"Silver Phial,\\" the thoughtful paradoxes of \\"The True One,\\" and the complex unity that only the \\"Silver Raven\\" seems to know.<br /><br />  I begin to understand now why \\"No Other\\" is highly regarded. Gene Clark is a significant musical poet laureate of our generation; the quintessential Byrd. Like the archetypal cowboy balladeer of old, what appears unassuming or naive, is redeemed by his unschooled common sense, authenticity and genuine effort. Appreciation for the artistic achievement on this album will only increase, I suspect, through time. I'm sorry I have only these posthumous words to share.onal texture of his work.

B0000AXE8I|1.0|<br />   Matrix was a great movie and that is ok but i cant believe anyone who cant easily understand that both this movie and the third episode are made just to earn more money from the name .  <br /> <br />in matrix reloaded,every single character talks and talks for hours with silly expressions that can feel like phylosophy to highschool kids,but for anyone else most of it,except some good parts,will remind you joey-dawson talks of dawsons creek:)) <br /> <br />there is no real storyline this time,except the silly \\"we all are a part of destiny\\" routine and some excuses to create action scenes,which will make you think why neo doesnt just fly off before fighting to the agents for about half an hour,or why is this highway so long and aimless :) <br /> <br />The action scenes in matrix was like a revolution in action movie industry , but this one simple uses over long kung fu scenes like a computer-made keanu reeves spins among lots of agents,it is so oblious that they are not fighting,they are just acting,cos no one gets hurt when they got hit,it is just an excuse to show another cool punching style. <br /> <br />This movie sucks.i mean really..i still feel for the money i gave to the ticket,and buying the dvd ? no way.. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CAXID|3.0|This is the final album in my collection that I have hunted down and purchased for this band. This album self titled 'Foo Fighters' is different from later albums, the sound of the music, the lyrics and design, infact everything from early Foo Fighters sounds different to the more mature, music minded band blaring out hit songs today. Whilst it is a comparitively 50/50 album, and only hardcore fans of the Foo Fighters will want to purchase this CD for their collection, this is a CD that gave the Foo Fighters clarity to enter the alt rock scene. Like some other reviewers before me, I will put my support in saying that the first 3 songs were the best of the albums. The other songs just lacked the maturity and came across as just right for teenagers and not for us adult minded listeners.<br /><br />This is not for everyone, only if you are dedicated Foo Fighter fan, should you contemplate getting this album release.
B000002J1S|5.0|In the world of progressive rock, few pieces of music stand out so far ahead as the Lamb and Selling England by Genesis.  But, there are other really great works out there, and these have not been mentioned.  Allow me to suggest listening to the first three Soft Machine albums (1, 2 and Third).  Next try listening to the late romantic composer, Gustav Mahler, esp. his symphonies no. 2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10 as well as his Lieder.  Few composers can pack as much emotion as him. Stravinsky, often called the father of modern classical music, is a very great composer and I think you would adore his Rite of Spring, Petrushka and Firebird.  Schubert is very dear to my heart - listen to his sym. no. 9 and his song cycle, Winterreise.  Back to rock music, I have always adored ELP (first 7 releases), Yes (almost all), early Rush, Happy the Man, Eno, Terry Riley, Gentle Giant (almost all), and numerous Canterbury rock bands.  After listening to as much music as I have, you realize though that the finest music ever written is from Bach and Handel, but the world of music would be missing a great deal without Genesis.
0679411585|5.0|I have to say that at first I was not a big reader about Vietnam, I always like reading military history but I could not get into Vietnam era books. However, that all changed when I read this book. I found it very informative and as a vet, it gave me a better apprieciation for the hell our guys went through. I would have liked to have served under a man like Hal Moore, he is a true professional and always looked out for his men. I loved the book and look forward to reading more about Vietnam. Thank you Hal Moore!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I have read some reviews by some rather dumb reviewers who gave this album 1 star saying it was dumb and trivial, the problem is that they don't get the irony and absurdity of the things that they say intentionally. Wow, imagine that, an album that does more than preach to stupid minded simpletons, ie, the american public in general. This album misses the 5th star, and this is where I agree with some of the other reviews, except, Daron is decent at accenting and backing up Serge, but please don't use him this much again. He's a crappy vocalist, you either have the magic formula for entertaining people or you don't. It's like when bands break up and they think that the part is as good as the whole and it's not.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Until this movie came along, the constant pattern had been: even-numbered Trek films good, odd-numbered Trek films mediocre or bad. <br /> <br />Alas, this even-numbered (10) Trek film is decidedly mediocre.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, I don't think the problem was a director who had no knowledge or love of Trek.  Nicholas Meyer had neither when he was hired and he did just fine. <br /> <br />The problem is that Baird isn't that good a director.  Or, rather, he's an \\"action\\" director, meaning that the focus of what he does tends to be action and not, say, characters or story.  Nemesis shows this clearly, as we are treated to a silly chase that doesn't advance the story one bit, with Picard gleefully speeding recklessly across the terrain. <br /> <br />It's also trying too hard to be Star Trek II (but then, aren't they all?).  Picard is given a suitable villain, and themes are woven so that the Picard/Shinzon conflict can explore them.  The difference is, Shinzon ultimately doesn't work because his origin is so contrived (and unnecessary), and the themes are touched on and abandoned.  Trek II, on the other hand, had a villain who was anything but contrived, and the themes were at the heart of the story, driving it, instead of just being along for the ride. <br /> <br />Finally, there's a needless death -- I won't say who, but it's pointless, and then immediately undermined.   <br /> <br />Not all is bad.  Visually it's very well done, with some incredible effects, and there are some nice moments.  The cast, for the most part, falls into its comfort zone.  There are moments at the wedding that are downright hilarous.  It's not boring (Trek I), or silly and pointless (Insurrection), or completely incoherent (Trek V).  And I'll grab the SCE for the deleted scenes, and the text commentary (which is always brilliant). <br /> <br />Sadly this looks to be it for TNG movies.  Closer to a whimper than a bang.
B00004TH6O|4.0|Take it as a sign of things to come - upon Rated R's release, Queens of the Stone Age rapidly seemed to be ascending the throne to hard rock royalty, and the album was one of Rolling Stone's Top 10 Albums of the Year.  With the benefit of hind sight after two more QOTSA releases, Rated R seems fairly juvenile - the songs here don't have the jolting intensity of the best songs even from Lullabies to Paralyze, and they certainly never approach the monster slyness and exhileration of Songs For The Deaf.  Even the ambitions are smaller here - songs like \\"Leg of Lamb\\" and \\"Monster In The Parasol\\" rock only intermittently, \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" is a jolt, but a joking one, and the 8-minute \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\" has moments of rock greatness, but feels quieter than everything on the next two records, preferring slow builds.  The moments that work best on this record are the atmospheric ones - \\"Headache,\\" \\"In The Fade,\\" or \\"Better Living Through Chemistry,\\" which seems to have a creepy, inactive minute midway through.  None of this makes the album bad, but it does make it, at times, feel like a wholly different group than the one that would make Songs For The Deaf.  Despite a generally solid collection of songs, I'm happy they traded atmosphere for claws.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I must admit that I did have preconceived notions about this piece of fiction; despite this I did try to watch the film with an open mind. <br /> <br />This is truly garbage.  It is full of out and out lies.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|These are 3 of my favorite movies. The combination of acting, camera use, special effects, soundtrack and atmosphere is stunning and may not be matched over a trilogy of movies for years to come. The only negative I can write about these films is that they seem to lose the originality factor over the course and therefore rely on the effects and \\"feelings\\" for the characters towards the end.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Simply put this album is truly brilliant. the musicianship is flawless, melodies are great, vocals are brutal. Album of the year.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin (2003.), the Led Zeppelin double DVD live release<br /><br />Led Zeppelin, after the Beatles, are the biggest selling album band of all time, clocking in at well over 200 million sales over the last 35 years since the release of their self titled debut album. However, on the flipside, Led Zeppelin were a very, very camera shy band, who disliked giving interviews, appearing commercially or letting their concerts be filmed. As a direct result, very few live documents exist of Led Zeppelin concerts and for many years, give or take the 1976 'The Song Remains The Same' release, legions of fans just had the studio albums available to them. However, this all changed in 2003 with the release of the 'How The West Was Won' 3 CD live set and this awesome double DVD 'Led Zeppelin' live offering.<br /><br />This DVD, after numerous reviews since its release 2 years ago is not averaging 5 stars on amazon.com for nothing. This is what Led Zep fans have waited for, and this double DVD is a seriously great experience. What makes the DVD even better is that it captures the band live throughout its career. Therefore, we get a capture of the early years, when the revolutionary hard-rock blues band were taking the world by storm, on the first DVD. Then, there is the second DVD which has live offerings from concerts through the 1970's, right up until 1979, the year before the tragic death of John Bonham, which ultimately split the band. Basically you see everything, including Plant's earlier to later stirring performances on the vocals and Jimmy Page's whirlwind, perfected guitar playing. The sound quality is amazing throughout and the production (overseen by non other than Jimmy Page himself) is excellent. The live concerts make up the real weight of time on the DVD but there is a good handful of bonuses too which make great DVD extras. So, what about the concerts themeselves on the DVD:<br /><br />LIVE AT THE ALBERT HALL (1970): This is the only full concert footage on the DVD and it is an absolutely killer capture of the band playing amazing bluesy hard rock from their first two albums. At over an hour and a half in length, the band gave the crowd timeless value for money. Its a great document to show how revolutionary Led Zeppelin were at that time, the crowd seem totally startled by the music and as a result are not as vocal as later crowds to the concerts. You can completely understand this, I myself was more than speechless when I watched it! There's some stellar moments, including the opening hard rocker 'Were Gonna Groove', a track which eventually got a feature on the 'Coda' outtake album. Jimmy Page's guitar work on White Summer/ Black Mountain Side is phenominal to say the least, as is his playing on Dazed and Confused where he plays his guitar with a violin bow! All in all, this concert, on DVD 1, is priceless!<br /><br />MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (1973): The first concert capture on DVD 2 is only of 4 songs but all of them really bring the house down. You can see by this stage how the band's concerts had become much more grander and explosive occasions. The band's performance 'Black Dog' is hair-raising to say the least and you see the crowd really getting into the music and participating in parts. Jimmy Page's guitar work (i'll say it again!) is amazing, especially at the end of 'Black Dog' and at the beginning of 'Since I've Bin Loving You'. Don't fail to notice John Paul Jones' Keyboard work on 'Misty Mountain Hop' either. The band close with 'The Ocean' in great style.<br /><br />EARL'S COURT (1975): This is one of Led Zep's most famous concerts and the 50 or so minute offering of this one shows why. Here we are treated to an acoustic set to start, with 'Going To California', 'That's The Way' and then 'Bron Yr Aur Stomp', which really gets the crowd into the groove. Then we have some stuff from Physical Graffiti, with 'Trampled Underfoot' and the American South themed 'In My Time Of Dying'. The real highlight comes at theend with, yes you guessed, 'Stairway To Heaven'. You see Page's playing on his legendary double-neck guitar and another stirring vocal performance from Plant. This song has become an anthem over the years and it is just amazing to see it played by the band themselves on screen.<br /><br />KNEBWORTH (1979): This is my favourite part of the DVD. The 50 minute capture of part of 1 of the two concerts Led Zeppelin gave at Knebworth in August 1979 is truly amazing. Attended by 1000's, this sadly, would be the last time the band would play in the UK, but what a fitting last time it was! Crashing performances of 'Rock n' Roll', 'Sick  Again' and a finishing 'Whole Lotta Love' medley are timeless. 'Achilles Last Stand' transmits masterfully live, as does 'In The Evening', with Bonham's mystic drumming at the start in tune with loads of strobe lighting. Robert Plant gives his most mature vocal performance here and Bonham drums in phenominal fashion.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Theres a number of extras on either DVD. On DVD 1 there are a number of live performances of 'Communication Breakdown' and 'Dazed And Confused'. On DVD 2, there are a couple of excellent promos of 'Over The Hills And Far Away' and 'Travelling Riverside Blues'. Also there is an interview of Robert Plant where he gives some information on what was the up and coming 'Physical Graffiti' album on the Old Grey Whistle Test. There is also a New York Press Conference where the interviewer asks Plant and Page some really stupid questions - its not surprising how the band ultimately withdrew from doing many interviews!<br /><br />The 'Led Zeppelin' DVD, to put it simply, is awesome. It is a classic 5 hour live take of one of my favourite bands and I have not regretted buying it in the slightest. If you want to see how true hard rock was done by the best, then look no further than this DVD. A must for any fan of the band, you can't be without this DVD!Heaven'.

B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is my favorite show!!  When it first came on, I did not think I would like it because it is a hospital show and my dad recomended it.  After the first episode it was my favorite show on TV!
B00097A5HW|5.0|Fijacion Oral takes us to a wonderful journey of new sounds and great vocals from Shakira. The music and the lyrics are magical! <br />It is a great pleasure to listen all of the songs from this album since each one of them is a masterpiece. Her strong and beautiful voice really comes through on this album. <br />Fijacion Oral it's a must!
B00004Y6NP|4.0|This is a really good album by Dire Straits, but not a great <br />one. The best songs would be So Far Away, Money for Nothing, & <br />Walk of Life. Here's how every song is on this album. <br /> <br />01. So Far Away: This is a great opener, one of their best. <br /> <br />02. Money For Nothing: My favorite song! Best ending riffs ever, <br />and I repeat this track a lot. Dire Straits' most popular song. <br /> <br />03. Walk Of Life: Another hit from Dire Straits. Another one of <br />my favorites. <br /> <br />04. Your Latest Trick: What the heck is a trumpet doing in this <br />song. Still not bad though. <br /> <br />05. Why Worry: In my opinion, this is the weakest song on the entire CD, it is sad to me. Great ending to this song though. <br /> <br />06. Ride Across The River: Kinda Instrumental. <br /> <br />07. The Man's Too Strong: Great guitar work on this but not the <br />best. <br /> <br />08. One World: Great song, rocks of 1985!!! <br /> <br />09. Brothers In Arms: Great album closer, based on a true story <br />about anti-war. <br /> <br />For any reason, this is a good album! <br /> <br />Even better, get this with Making Movies,  <br />Love Over Gold, On Every Street, and On the Night, <br />Live at the BBC, Alchemy, and Dire Straits Debut.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I don't want to come of sounding angry or spiteful, but it is getting annoying about people stating that the energy of this band is substatially lost in their new effort. though the absence of both dave grohl and nick oliveri is intimidating to the hardcore fans from the earlier albums, the real problem with Lullabies to Paralyze is the latter part of the album. Songs like \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" and \\"The Blood is Love\\" would've been successful if they had cut the time in half. The riffs are as enticing as any other cuts of the Queens, but when they clock, in at six or more minutes long they seem drawn out. Fortunately the first seven or eight songs are varied and classic qotsa material that it saves the album from becoming a coaster. Most listeners will find that even if they are Queens fans, they'll most likely change the cd instead of listening to the painstakingly drawn out finale.
B0009RJPC8|4.0|A dear friend of mine sent me this c.d. from London for my birthday.  A friend of James' back in college she felt he was onto something and I think she's right.  This truly has been one of those cd's that I have not been able to get out of my head as I continue to listen to it whenever I get a chance.  It continues to grow on me more and more each time I listen to it.  It is very much like a warm cup of tea that you can't put down on a warm winter day and just like each cup, you get a slightly different but soothing sensation each time.  If you enjoy listening to the melancholy yet melodic music of such European artists like David Gray, Coldplay, Damien Rice and even Del Amitri then you will enjoy listening to the stories of his experiences woven into each of his songs.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido is even better live than in her albums. She's more versatile and shows a variance in tempo in all her songs. One moment that stands out is when she's singing 'White Flag' where, towards the end of the song, the crowd starts singing along,she stops, and the crowd finishes the song. That was really amazing. The best performances were: White Flag,Thank you, and Do you have a little time.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|It is, without a doubt, the best System yet...Not to say that it is System's best...only because I don't think we've seen it yet.  Well worth the buy,  listen...enjoy...get the message!!!
B000667FN8|5.0|Aye, there's plenty as what I can say about Simple Plan. 'Course, none of which is bad about them. I'm sure everyone's seen how they've became Mtv's 'sellouts' and everything else and how others say, well Greenday is pretty awesome as well. Well, Green day has also been on Mtv. So doesn't that make them a 'sellout' as well? And every band becomes a 'sellout' at one point. But this isn't about all bands, this is about Simple Plan. <br /> <br />I actually remember when Simple Plan's, 'I'm just a kid' aired on the radio waves. At first, I wasn't too fond of it but that might be due to the fact I was on the phone and wasn't paying attention to the words. But then I begged and pleaded with my mother to buy that album. I enjoyed it greatly, hell it's got scratches and has worn down from me playing it too often.  <br /> <br />And once I was hearing about their sophomore album, Still not getting any was to hit stores in a matter of months, I was excited. I got the album the day it hit stores, it's good your own mother works at a Target store. Once I got it in my hands, I played it and listened to every song and every word and every cord and every riff and pound that the members have created for this album. And to tell you the truth, I have fallen more in love with them.  <br /> <br />I, myself haven't had a smooth ride in life and I'm sure neither has alot of teens have either. But their music has helped me alot through the rough edges. Songs like 'Perfect World' revolves around a catrosphe. And it doesn't have to be a breakup, as Chuck Comeau has even said.  <br /> <br />Like I said earlier, I can sit here and talk about how much Simple Plan's helped me through the rough edges on things called life. And there's always going to be 'bad reviews.' But just because they're getting bad reviews doesn't mean they're going to stop them. 'I'm the one you love to hate.' The band has done an awesome job on this ablum. And if I could, I'd rate them with more then five stars.
0767827716|5.0|I generally dislike anything connected to Steven King.  By contrast, Christine hit a chord with me.<br />Its not about the car trying to kill people or the nut who cant give up his baby.<br />Its about the assembly line switching from craftsmanship built in to every model to cookie cutter workmanship.<br />Christine is getting reveange against greedy executives for selling out to cheap parts and motorized boxes.<br />Beside an outstanding script and excellent acting, I fell in love with the sound track.  Before this movie, I had never heard \\"Bad To The Bone\\".  Now its one of my favorites!!!!!!!!<br />Secretly we all wish for a homicidal classic that could run modern motor nightmares off the road for good!!!!!
B00068C7WA|3.0|There are just so many people that sometimes have to know a artist through the sounds of Broadway. Why? Because there is no other way you could find the songs he or she has made but there. For one of the greatest artists of the U.S., Billy Joel, he has truly shown that truthful with the status of Movin' Out. Although it is sad he hasn't recorded a new tune in almost a decade. His songs still remain true from the heart after all this time. Sadly, when it comes to hits packages, they almost hit the nail the nail on the head completely, especially for Billy Joel.<br /><br />Piano Man: The Very Best Of Billy Joel is a single disc collection consisting of 19 tracks that the piano man has truly made a spectacle of. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still show his music simply is still alive. There are so many great songs here that are highlighted here including Piano Man, River Of Dreams, the hard driven We Didn't Start The Fire, all the way to Soul-driven tracks like Tell Her About It, The Grammy-Winning Just The Way You Are, Uptown Girl, and Movin' Out (Anthony's Song).<br /><br />Yet, with the good sides about this collection, there are a lot of disadvantages from this collection. One of them, is that the collection is a little bit expensive, where you could get most of these tracks from another Billy Joel collection like 2001's Essential Billy Joel. Another disadvantage is that the album also does overshadow so many good songs as well like, The Longest Time, Say Goodbye To Hollywood, A Matter of Trust, and the upbeat Big Shot from 52nd Street.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Billy Joel has truly made so many great songs for all to enjoy. It is just sad that with a generation that is more into acts like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez, doesn't know how brilliant Billy Joel has made pop music. Still, Piano Man: The Very Best Of Billy Joel isn't a bad collection especially for anybody who doesn't have any of his records, but die hard longtime fans might want to avoid this collection. It doesn't really go to extremes.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Mastering: B+<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+s might want to avoid this collection. It doesn't really go to extremes. <br /> <br />Album Cover: B <br /> <br />Price: C <br /> <br />Mastering: B+ <br /> <br />Songs: C+ <br /> <br />Overall: C 1/2+
B00005JNSK|5.0|I've seen it twice already and I am going to see it again.  Up to this point, I hadn't been to the cinema in six years.  The opening credits with it's music is absolutely mesmerizing - the whole film, each scene, each frame is a work of art. <br /> <br />Tim Burton - thru the eyes of humble, poor, yearning, starving Charlie - really whet's our appetite to get into that factory and meet Willy Wonka.  When we finally do get to meet him, it completely upstages Gene Wilder's introduction in the original.  Depp's portrayal is incredible.  His face tells a thousand tales.  He really need not speak a word.  As he greets his guests, we see the range of emotions as this breathlessly giddy, excited, anxious genius-hermit suddenly becomes profoundly and painfully awkward and speechless.  I squirmed in my seat.  Throughout the film, Wonka's mannerisms evoke the same reaction as his guests - that this guy has lost his \\"maltballs\\". <br /> <br />Depp and Burton show insight into what anyone might be like with Wonka's background, then isolated from society with the company of a bunch of identical (are they cloned?) cocoa-addicted Oompa-loompas.  (Personally, I would like to know how Wonka keeps such a svelte figure surrounded by all that churned, light, frothy chocolate.)   <br /> <br />There's been all kinds of shots taken at Depp's portrayal of Wonka.  Comparisons to Michael Jackson (OH POPPYCOCK!!!)  So it is amusing that in the movie itself, puns are made regarding Wonka's hairdo.  Inside joke?  All the same, he leaves an everlasting impression.   <br /> <br />But this movie is not really about Wonka but about the importance of family.  What a contrast between Wonka and Charlie!  One is wealthy and famous, the other poor and unremarkable.  And yet both have known the deprivation of something they loved - candy.  By the end, Wonka learns that there is something even sweeter and why Charlie is the luckiest boy in the whole wide world. <br /> <br />
0062515675|5.0|For those who have read other books on this area, it is a gentle reminder of what is really important in life and why it is. Those who have never delved into the meaning of life will find it eye opening. Either way I found it to be helpful and enlightening. The theme, although not a new one, remains relevant and timely.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|A fun romp if you aren't a religious fanatic in which case the liberties taken by the story will probably offend you. Constantine is a Magus who does good deeds for completely selfish reasons in order to clean his slate of sins to get into heaven. So, he primarliy acts as an exorcist to the demonic spirits that try to break the balance of power between god and satan. <br /> <br />Lucifer is played very well and will give you a laugh or two with his interaction with Constantine. <br /> <br />Fans of Mage, Ars Magica, or other roleplaying games will probably enjoy the cosmology and the cool visual effects of Constantine employing his magic against the denizens of Hell.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|If you think that owning a Simon & Garfunkel Greatest Hits is sufficient to satisfy your cd collection, or that it would contain all the songs from them that you need then you are making a big mistake. Bridge Over Troubled Water is easily one of the best albums ever, the best S&G album and one of my personal favorite albums ever. What makes the album so great is the same thing that makes all great albums great. The songs that are not the known songs are as good if not, dare I say, better than the hits. And the album is certainly loaded with hits, including the title track, \\"Cecilia\\", \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\". But songs such as \\"Frank Lloyd Wright\\", \\"Baby Driver\\" and \\"Why Don't You Write Me\\" are as good as any S&G songs. If you don't believe me buy the album. I encourage you to do so. Don't mistake this album either for earlier acoustic sounding S&G. \\"Bridge\\" is a lush, multi-layered and very full sounding album. It's simply very enjoyable music to listen to. Buy it now, buy two in case you lose or scratch one. Seriously, it's that good!
B00000IREA|5.0|This is a really amazingly funny movie, at once a good sci fi, sex goddess-creating classic, it is also deliciously quirky.  I mean, can you picture a spacecraft whose interior is fur-lined?<br /><br />Fonda is Barbarella, a kind of futuristic bimbo - in part the product of a highly developed permissive society - who is on a mission to, well, you have to see it to believe it.  Somehow, Vadim really pulls it all off, though I suppose it is best to see this in an altered state of consciousness, 60s-style.  Really, tho, it is hard to stop laughing at this, while taking in an engaging story and unforgettable imagery.  Really, this is a classic.<br /><br />Interestingly, while living in France, I bought a bunch of Barbarella paperbacks out of curiosity and discovered to my delight that the movie is actually very faithful to the original comic - even the dialogue follows the crytptic utterances of the characters closely.<br /><br />Fonda is perfectly cast.  She is stunningly beautiful in youth, at the apex of her stardom in many ways, and you can tell she is having fun with this role.  But the acting of the others is also very good and fun, from DuranDuran to the sexualised angel in his nest.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.  This is weirdness that works extremely well.
0312323859|5.0|When I first started reading \\"Something Borrowed\\", I had already decided that there was no way I was going to like Rachel but few pages into the book and Giffin had me rooting for her and hating her friend Darcy. By the time the book finished, I really disliked her and since \\"Something Blue\\" is about Darcy, I was skeptical. Well, long before the book finished, I wanted to give Darcy a chance and loved her by the end of it and that is all due to the author's witty writing skill which takes us so naturally into the tranformation of Darcy. I especially loved the \\"Steps to becoming a better Darcy!\\" This is a beautiful book that you would not want to put down and it evokes the most natural emotions and makes you believe that you too, know someone like Rachel and Darcy.  All in all, a very commendable debut for this talented author and please do not miss out on either of her books. You will not be disappointed!
B000001FKY|3.0|After the craze of big-hair metal sank firmly into the minds of spotty-faced teens both here and across the pond Def Leppard also found their element. When the \\"Hysteria\\" album was released it was an instant clasic among run-of-the-mill metal-heads with bleached denim jackets and shredded blue jeans, and rightly so, the album contains the band's most prolific songwriting beginning with \\"Love Bites\\" and especially the under-appreciated \\"Animals\\". My gripe at the time was the over-production by producer Mutt Lange who must have spent thousands of hours at the board turning knobs and adding all sorts of sonic effects that truly get in the way of several fine songs leaving the band with a \\"wet\\" sound and enough reverb for 10 efforts. But as someone once told me, a good producer can fix many-a-bad song........maybe.....you don't think........hmmmm. Nah...Lep was the tops, their songwriting was beyond reproach. It's just me who's out of touch.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Most people reading this review know that Metallica has been one of the preeminent thrash bands of the past 20 years - indeed, they were among the first groups to create the very sound we know as thrash.  20 years after their onset, the band found themselves in perilous circumstances once again, with tensions growing between its members.  Jason Newsted, their bass player of 10+ years, had left, and the rest of the band were struggling to recapture their creative drive and fire. <br /> <br />This is where the documentary picks up.  Metallica were in the early stages of recording their first album of new material since 1997's Reload, and they were obviously having difficulties.  The filmmakers capture the odyssey of finding a new bass player and the introduction of band therapy seamlessly into showing the audience where it has led the band to today. <br /> <br />Obviously, the band members had creative control over the doc - who could imagine Lars settling for otherwise? - although they admirably let their dirty laundry air, so to speak.  There are clips of all-out screaming between the members, especially between Lars and James.  The absence of James for a long portion of the film, interestingly, adds tension and introduces traditional dramatic elements to what is supposed to be a documentary.  It makes the film eminently watchable and worth viewing multiple times.   <br /> <br />Basically, if you want a look at what goes on in Metallica's world, this is as good as any of a chance you are going to get.  For non-Metallica fans, it still has value as it's a bit funny hearing the guys talk normally to each other, without any censoring (and believe me, there is a lot to censor), as well as see a vital and dynamic band go through relationship problems.  You can see the band changing and transforming as they learn to channel their anger and frustration in postive ways, and as a result, the working process improves.  Ultimately, it ends on a positive note, with the band releasing their new album St. Anger and embarking on a massive world tour.  Plus, the extras - which include nearly 45 minutes of deleted scenes, all worthwhile, and several interviews with the filmmakers - are well above-average from what you'd normally expect from a DVD.  Simply put, this is a highly entertaining film, whether you are a Metallifan or not.
B000286RNY|5.0|The chopped-up American-release version is pleasant enough, but the real treasure is the original version.  The subtitles often hint at what is actually meant, with the odd word choices making it somehow more entertaining, while Chow and co. often don't need much translation.  Vicki Zhao is a delight to watch, and the film, like so many of Steven Chow's, has a feel very similar to the silent slapsticks of the Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin.  The story line is not too different from other Chow movies, although in this one he's pretty likeable from the beginning.  The hurt woman/healing man 'rags-to-riches' romance still works, and there is considerably less blood, but just as much humor.  This is undoubtedly the best Chow movie for American audiences to start with.
B00003CXCT|1.0|It should be painfully obvious to all that Lucas will never stop changing the original Star Wars series.  Why is this, do you ask?  My guess is that he KNOWS that he's lost his spark, his talent, so he's continuing to focus on the only great thing he's ever done in his life and hawk it to a new audience.  There's no other reason for it.  He could have been working on Indiana Jones 4 ten years ago rather than trying to fix something that was never broken.  <br /> <br />I've been hearing people say things like we \\"extremist\\" fans need to get a life and get over the changes. <br /> <br />Why would these extremists not have lives because they don't want their memories stomped on? Lucas NEEDS TO KNOW that his real fans continue to want the original versions released if there's ever going to be a remote chance of him doing so.  You know how he likes to 'change', so there's always a possibility. Simply rolling over and swallowing his garbage will only ensure that he continues to produce it. <br /> <br />Others consider the special editions to be only a small change. <br /> <br />A small change?  I see it more as a series of huge changes. Let me explain how this seems to many of us true fans: The movies have been dissected; they're no longer whole.  They've been, in a word, [adulterated] to the highest degree (but with George the degree can only get higher, so maybe 'highest' is an overstatement).  Speaking for myself, I watch these movies not only for entertainment, but to bring back a NOSTALGIC feeling.  When GL made these changes, he took away the nostalgia of the series.  THAT'S what many fans are bitter over...it's not about thinking that the new versions are horrible, but it's a feeling of betrayal, as if something once great and important during a certain period of our lives has been cast to the wind.  I enjoyed my childhood, and Star Wars was a huge part of it.  It's not healthy to *live* in the past, but we all like to reflect on it from time to time, whether it bethrough music, old toys, or movies.     <br /> <br />Others say that the changes are acceptable to everyone but angry, lonely, borderline sociopaths. <br /> <br />So, everyone who refuses to settle for this insult is an angry, lonely, borderline sociopath?  Give me a break. True fans simply don't take whatever's thrown at them.  If we have a problem with the changes, then we have the right to let it be known.  Such personal attacks on character are not valid. <br /> <br />Changes aside, the sound is also substandard as many reviewers have posted. I didn't actually purchase this abomination myself, but allowed a friend to watch it on my home theater system.  Audio inconsistencies are to be expected when considering the technology of the day.  Sound isn't nearly as easy to alter as video.  The video is much better than the 1997 special editions, but it didn't meet my expectations either. <br /> <br />All in all, if you weren't happy with the special edition changes, save your money for a laserdisc player, check eBay for 'special' deals, or continue to watch the movies on VHS. This set is nothing more than 50 bucks worth of disappointment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril completely rocks! I mean, she writes about stuff that she knows and sings just amazing as well. Ya can't find that quality in many singers no days. Thsi CD was just great!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles' set the benchmark with their Hell Freezes Over release, which is still the benchamrk DVD, but the Farewell I release doesn't disappoint either. Produced by Glenn Frey it has the all the high productuion values you'd expect from the Eagles, and it shows them, if not at the height of their power, they are probably at the peak of their enjoyment. This was a great concert, highlighted by the band's obvious delight in performing together again.  <br /> <br />Joe Walsh can always be counted on for his comic antics on stage, but he gets an extended set in this show and hams it up to the obvious delight of even the stoic Henley. <br /> <br />That's right, Don Felder wasn't there, and that's sad for Don, but there's nothing missing from the music, and there are even some novel treatments of old standards just to show the boys are still working for their money. <br /> <br />Say what you will about the Eagles, but this is the music that defined a generation, and it's never looked half as good or sounded better than it does on this disk. Enjoy !
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I loved this CD! All of the songs on it are just fab. It had so much more depth than her first one, which was also fantastic. This girl can really sing. And the fact that she writes her own songs as well...Well, ya'll can see why I gave her 5 friggin' stars!
B000069HK2|5.0|after i bought this album, it's gotten a lot of time in my discman. this band is just friggin amazing. they're so different from the mindless 'punk' bands you hear on the radio. the melodies and music are so awesome, *as a drummer, i recognize the INSANE drumming*. and bert can actually sing amazingly! standout songs are definitely Buried Myself Alive, Box Of Sharp Objects, Blue and Yellow and Maybe Memories. purely incredible album.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the mute comes off after a strong De-Loused in the comatorium released before it.  It is an exhilarating experience to sit and listen to its depth, its swaying emotions.  You become the story, you live it,and you end it.  It isn't anything you have ever experienced before,    and you never will experience anything else like it again
B000001EL3|5.0|Remastered goodness! Kiss rocks so hard it's the ultimate hardness. I am so syked about this recording. I love this band. Detroit Rock City 4 Ever let me tell you. I listen to this album when I get up in the morning, I listen to it when I speed to work in the afternoon. I listen to this when I'm getting syked to get together with my lady. It puts me in the mood!! This is rock and roll at its finest, like a hot blonde with a tight body and a fast car. I love Kiss! Rock and Roll!!
1400032717|5.0|I sped through this book, carrying it around the house as I fixed snacks.  It was such a touching book, it seemed glued to my hands until I finished it.  I loved the characters - they were all so perfectly human, that is, they were all flawed.  My heart just went out to Christopher's dad, and then eventually, his mother as well.  Definitely a Must-read book!
B000002UR7|3.0|You can tell the band was just starting to get suff going on this album. I love the song Creep, but I can understand if other people aren't so sure about it. The song rocks and makes me want to sing along, but the rest of the songs are only okay. I can understand why Creep was so huge on the radio, and plus, great guitar work. The guitars are classic. But more a more accessible album, one should check out Kid A. Kid A is definitely the best Radiohead album in the history of rock.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Others have given you the run down on every show and every tune, on Bonham's solo, etc., so I'll just add some comments.    Some people seem not to like Zeppelin at all.  Well, I guess if you don't like Zeppelin you won't like 2 DVD's full of live Zeppelin.     Some people are disappointed that live Zeppelin doesn't sound like studio Zeppelin.  I guess they go to those concerts where the boy bands lip sync their records.  Live performance and studio  recording are two completely different art forms.  Jimmy Page was really into studio work and might put 4 guitar tracks playing at once in a song.  Of course he'll only play one guitar at a time on stage.  The live performance isn't an imitation of the studio recording.  They started playing the tune live before they recorded it in the studio.  Zeppelin puts out a whole lotta music for a 3 piece band.  Page is all over the guitar, Jones is all over the bass, plays two keyboards at once, plays mandolin and stand up bass, and Bonham keeps things moving.  Plant was a rare rock singer who could actually sing.  Some of the tunes in these concerts are encores, the last song of the night, and his voice isn't all rasped out like some rock screamers.      The evolution of the Zeppelin audiences in these shows recorded from 1969 to 1979 is interesting.  In the earliest shows, the audience isn't really into them.  Maybe the audience is a tv audience not into rock, or maybe it's some Danish kids who are just kind of stunned by Plant's over-the-top theatrics and the brooding Jimmy Page.  Then they started picking up a following by 1970 and by 1973 they are riding a huge wave of popularity.  The audience in 75 is similar, but in the last show  from 1979, there's a big audience but something's missing: girls.  The audience is 95%, maybe more, guys.  It's a reflection of the cultural changes of the 70's and also of the consequences of Zeppelin's publicity shyness and reduced touring activity in the late 70's.      It's interesting thatsome people call them the greatest rock band ever, while others feel they have to put them down.  In interviews, they said they just wanted to make some music and have some fun.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the best! Radiohead rocks. What a great band, what a brilliant guitarist and singer, the best electronic manipulation in years. Not as good as Kid A, but brilliant.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon is insane, violent chaos, like a dying animal thrashing animal attacking everything in sight and making as much noise as possible.  Whereas bands like Meshuggah are chaotic in a machine-like, cold sense, Mastodon is the exact opposite.  This stuff is very organic, the drums ripple and build up and quiet and suddenly explode and are just plain crazy...<br /><br />Mastodon is tough to categorize, but they are defitinely metal and have this bizarre ethnic aesthetic that reminds me of Roman and Greek mythology.  The drummer, Brann Dailor, is simply of the most frenetic drummers I've heard, he is constantly providing tricky cymbal work and fills and just never lets up.  The guitar tone is as low as loud as I've ever heard, providing the \\"crushing\\" feeling another reviewer mentioned.  The vocals are bellowing roars, very unique, very well fit the music.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say about this band if you haven't heard March of the Fire Ants, go download that, it's how I got into them.  But anyway, if you have heard that song and love it like I did, you can expect a few more tracks in that style on the first half of the album.  Shorter, more straightforward and riff dependant.<br /><br />The latter half of the CD is mostly epics, and contains what I think are the best tracks of the CD.  These songs have clean sections, and possess a beautiful sensitivity not present in the first couple tracks.  The first one of these is \\"Ol'e Nessie\\".  \\"Trainwreck\\" and \\"Trilobite\\" follow suit, and Trainwreck even has a quiet, gasping clean voice in it that sounds very sincere.  These songs bleed sadness, very personal yet vague.<br /><br />Remission has a lot of variety and is very multi-faceted, as well as being extremely technical and heavy.  I especially recommend it to fans of Nile, who has a similar idea behind their music but instead chooses Egypt as inspiration.  Also to fans of Meshuggah and Dillinger Escape Plan, like this band they are technical, metal insanity.  For a long time I forgot I had this... my loss, I guess.cal, metal insanity.  For a long time I forgot I had this... my loss, I guess.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is the first of the two epic Avenged Sevenfold CD's, and some would argue that they have 3 (The debut full-length, \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\") but STST doesn't have the length of this masterpeice and its successor (The controversial \\"City of Evil\\"). When City of Evil came out, there was a lot of mixed feelings, most of them due to comparisons to this album, the critacally acclaimed and well-respected \\"Waking the Fallen.\\" I'm not going to go right out and say one is better than the other, but if you have heard CoE and want to get this one, just know that this cd is much more hardcore-influenced with lots of screaming from vocalist M. Shadows. If you have this cd and are intested in getting CoE, note that City of Evil is much more 80's metal influenced with 99% clean vocals. Now, to Waking the Fallen.    This cd is epic. Avenged Sevenfold go away from the trend of 2 to 3 minute songs and pin lengthy tracks spanning from the upper 4 minute range to nearly 9, I would guess that the average song on this cd is about 5 and a half minutes. If you are unfamiliar with the Avenged Sevenfold sound, then know that they sound similar to what Atreyu would sound like if they're lead singer could actually sing.     1. Waking the fallen -7/10- Its just an opening track, but it is one of the coolest into's I've ever heard.    2. Unholy Confessions -9/10- There is a very good chance that this is the first Avenged Sevenfold you will hear, as it was the first single. While certaintly not their greatest song, this one tells you exactly what A7X is about: great instrumentals, the guitarists (Synyster Gates- Lead, Zacky Vengence- Rhythm) play excellent together, the drum is tight with the rest of the rhythm, nearly inaudible bass, mostly screaming vocals during the verses with a catchy, singing chorus.    3. Chapter Four -9.5/10- This song starts out with some maniac drumming by The Reverend (And this is supposed to be his slow cd!) leads into some great riff and great screaming over singing layered vocals. The name \\"Chapter Four\\" refers to the book of Genisis in the bible, which is what the song is about (For the record they are not a christian band, but they find the bible interesting).    4. Reminissions -9.5/10- Starts out similar to the last song with the drums, but gets to the vocals much quickly as Shadows alternates between screaming and singing. Then, out of nowhere, the middle of the song contains an amazing part where Shadows sings over an acoustic guitar. Great track.    5. Desecrate Through Reverence -9/10- Starts out with a token A7X riff, then after about a minute and a half gets into the vocals. Shadows really shows his voice on the chorus, and then to end out the song he has an amazing singing part... I wish he sang more actually.    6. Eternal Rest -9/10- This song shows the diversity of A7X. First off, who starts out a song with a solo? After Synyster's 20 second part, Shadows screams pull you into a song nothing like the previous 5. They also bring out an organ in this song. An organ! \\"Dark in their hearts, I can feel the burn inside of me\\" that line gives this song a dark, evil feel.    7. Second Heartbeat -9/10- This song was a favorite when it was featured on a couple of compilations before they redid it for this cd. Most people seem to like the original better, I perfer this one, its sligtly slower but the production is much better. This song has more of a punk/metal feel than alot of the other songs on this cd. Another great solo ends another great song.    8. Radiant Eclipse -9.5/10- Most people agree that this is the most underrated A7X song, the best comparison I can give is that most of it is similar to Decesecrate Through Reverence but slower, and then the chorus comes in and Shadows gives you the definitons of \\"soaring vocals.\\" This one and the last are the only songs in this cd with any punk influence.     After the last song, your thinking what else can this band do? You've heard all the previous efforts, eachcompletely different until the last one, which was similar to track 5. You might expect to have more of the same, that you've heard all they can do. If so, you are wrong. Here comes the turning point of this CD.    I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1) -20/10- To start out this track, you hear piano. It seems out of place on this cd, but its there nontheless. Then, you get hammered by the heavy riff. Slower than expected, but not shocking from this band. You brace yourself for the piercing screams, but they don't come. Instead, the mourful, emotional voice of M. Shadows rings in your ear as he sings an amazing song about suicide. Sounds more like a lower-pitched Bruce Dickinson than M. Shadows, as he pours all of his heart and soul out. \\"Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood, all the ones around me, I cared for and most of all I loved, but I can't see myself that way, please don't forget me, or cry when I'm away.\\" An amazing line, Shadows sings it to perfection. This is the epic song, at nearly 9 minutes long. As the static overcomes his voice in the end, you are thrust into part 2.    10. I Won't See You Tonight (Part 2)-12/10- Rising out of the static is an enormous growl from Shadows. This is the response to the suicide commited in the last one, and as the last one is a soft, mournful ballad, this one is a rage of emotions, Shadows sings and screams his heart out, Synyster plays his greatest solo yet, and you hear the chorus from part 1 one last time before this 14 minute two part epic comes to a close.    11. Clairvoyant Disease -9.5/10- IWSYT is a hard act to follow. At the start of this song, Shadows shows you how soft he can go. The whispers in the background give this song depth. There is little hardcore influence in this song, after Eternal Rest there was very little hardcore influence left in the cd. Another great solo. Awesome track    12. And All Things Will End -10/10- The best ending I have ever heard to a cd. This one starts out soft and acoustic, but doesn'twaste any time to get into the thick of things. This song is a straight up metal track. The cd closes with a slowing guitar solo, and your left begging for more.    This cd is simply incredible. Most of the songs I had to give lower scores so I didn't go too high. Also, I should say they didn't \\"steal\\" Overkills logo, there was no copywrite on it, and as for the makeup, well they don't wear it anymore and that does not pertain to the music anyways, which is superb. This cd is unclassifiable, you can call it metalcore or hardcore or whatever but you can always find something in there that makes it not fit. Vocally, Shadows is at his best on this cd (The singing on the new cd, \\"City of Evil,\\" while not bad, comes off as a little whiney due to him trying to sound like Axl Rose, come on Shadows bring back the clean vocals from this cd!). Shadows has one of the best voices out there when he's on form, and it doesn't hurt to have one of the best casts of musicains behind him. The bassist (Johnny Christ) is actually very good, you just can't hear him on this cd. Excellent release, but the best is yet to come from this young band.
0156027321|3.0|I was not overly impressed with this book.  While it had some fascinating parts, other parts were dull and I actually found myself skimming the text rather than savoring the words, as I would do with a novel I enjoy.  (The author seems to like lists: lists of zoo animals, lists of contents in lifeboat, lists of maladies of a castaway.)  But mostly, I felt ambivalent about the story.  If it is fiction, then the whole \\"author's note\\" at the beginning is invented and Pi is not a real person.  If it is a true story, then why is it classified by Amazon.com under \\"literature and fiction\\"?  If it is supposed to be an allegory, I feel it has too much realism to work as an allegory (eating tiger feces -- what is allegorical about that?)  If it is supposed to be true-to-life, then what's with the \\"botanical discovery\\" and other such bizarre events?  And the whole thing about his name never becomes relevant to the main events of the story.  I felt the book came closest to making sense with Pi's \\"alternative story\\" at the end, but even that is thrown into doubt by the remainder of the book.  I could not feel for Pi because I could not pull any sense from his confusion.  He suffered, yes, but where exactly is the tragedy?  With the story having so many unstable moments, the narrator becomes unreliable, and I felt like I was being scammed.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|OK, one word summary for this album: amazing.  Sufjan's CD for 2005 eclipsed my expectations.  If you are into Greetings from Michigan, then this album will treat you well.  Illinois goes into different genres of music with straight-up folk and even electric guitar songs.  Over-all, this album is a strong composition that is very easy to become used to.
B000069HKH|5.0|The Boss comes up with a set that all Americans will love and cherish.  He took his time, did it right, and produced the album that was perfect for it's time and place.    How can anybody not be brought to an emotional peak by these words:    It was dark, too dark to see, you held me in the light you gave  You lay your hand on me  Then walked into the darkness of your smoky grave  Somewhere up the stairs into the fire    You walked into the darkness of your smoky grave?  Heady stuff, and I can't listen without tearing up for the heroes that actually did go up the stairs, of their own free will, to help others.  May God Bless em all.    That said, Bruce has layered this set about as thickly as any he's ever done.  There are horns, strings (lots of violin parts), steel drums, voices, keyboards and, um, what's he got in the band now?  4 guitar players?  Springsteen himself, Lofgren, Little Stevie, and his wife.  Yep, four.  Well, a bunch of guitar tracks anyway.  Even the rockers have chimes and stuff in them.      But, underneath it all, is the traditional but oh-so-powerful drumming by Max Weinberg.  The band is always in time with that backbeat of his, blasting the tempo along.  He drives all this, and drive it he does, with the solid bass playing of Garry Tallent.  With that foundation, the production doesn't really seem overdone.    There are rockers, up-tempo songs, slow songs, catchy songs, pop songs, 'bout like most E-Street Band albums.  Difference is, love and duty called them someplace higher on this one.    A triumphant labor of love.
B000929AJQ|4.0|OK, I'll be the first one to admit that I was slightly taken aback at the sound of Reznor's new disc. More acoustic guitars and pianos than we're used to, and a less slick overall feel left me a bit underwhelmed at first. But then, two days later, I listened to it again and it grew on me, and then again, and before I knew it I was listening to this album twice a day! After all is said and done, I must confess that I now really like this album! It's not quite as good as \\"The Fragile\\", but everything is just so interesting and experimental that I can't help but be impressed. Moody piano pieces like \\"All The Love In The World\\", great radio-friendly tunes like \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\", dark, gritty stuff like \\"Love is Not Enough\\" and \\"With Teeth\\", and truly unorthodox songs like \\"Only\\" and \\"Sunspots\\", which sound nothing like previous NIN offerings. Trent Reznor's voice still hits all the right angry and tortured notes, and Dave Grohl's drumming really shines, especially on tracks like \\"You Know What You Are\\". All in all, great stuff.<br /><br />If you're an industrial or hard rock fan I whole-heartedly recommend this album, but PLEASE give it several listens before you decide whether you like this new direction NIN has taken. I think that most people will be surprised how much it grows on them.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This DVD has awesome vintage footage of the Who, starting off with an explosive (literally) version of \\"My Generation,\\" and going on to display other concert footage, interviews, and promos.  The remastering is excellently done as well.  Even if you're not a Who fan, you should check this out.  And if you are a Who fan, you wil be stunned.
B000092ZYX|3.0|This album is good, don't get me wrong.  But this is RADIOHEAD we're talking about, the most influential and original band of the 1990s who brought us the BENDS, OK COMPUTER and KID A.  All masterpieces in their own right.  Then after the slightly disappointing AMNESIAC (understandable as it was really KID A's left overs) comes HAIL TO THE THIEF.  HTTT definitely has its share of good songs, whether its the punky Orwell-inspired opener \\"2+2=5\\", the slow, unsettling ballad \\"Sail to the Moon\\", the Classical Gas-like \\"Go to Sleep\\" or the strong first single \\"There There\\", however its biggest problem lies in that there is no unifying theme that the songs share with each other, which in turn makes the album feel more like a messy rarities/b-sides album or, at its best, a greatest hits.  The songs on the Bends were all basically straight-ahead rockers, while tracks on OK COMPUTER all feared the implications of technology in the future and all the electronically conceived tracks on KID A created the sensation of being on another planet. Perhaps Hail to the Thief's hodge-podgy style was what the band were aiming for, because the way in which this album plays out is certainly different to any have done before.  Another problem I had with it was that it also showed signs that their new \\"avant-garde electronic style\\" was already dating, with songs such as BACKDRIFTS and THE GLOAMING falling extremely flat. <br /> <br />If The Bends, Ok Computer, and KID A were all five star albums, Amnesiac a four, and Pablo Honey a two, I see this as about a three and a half.  If IS definitely worth buying if you are a fan however I would strongly recommend their 1995-2000 period material before getting this.
0375703861|5.0|When this book came out back in 2000 to widespread acclaim, I made up mind not read it. It seemed like the usual hoary, pretentious crap that most critics like to lap up with vigor. Recently, however, I've become very interested in South Asian literature, and a great many of my friends and sources on the Web were touting 'White Teeth''s Bangladeshi characters as being very well drawn out. So, I decided to get the audio book. If the book sucked, at least it would still keep me engaged in something while I was driving around. <br /> <br />The beginnining of the book is very slow, and goes on for a while about Archie, one of the two main characters. Just as I was losing hope, the Bangladeshi character, Samad appeared. After that, it was off to the races. Smith has the gift of making somewhat unlikable characters into ones the reader completely sympathizes with and cares about. Samad hates the fact he's in England, is a hypocritical pious man, and very rude and short with his family. Yet, I kept wanting to see what would happen next. To me, that is the mark of a truly good book. <br /> <br />The rest of the characters were also very well drawn, and Smith showed the trials and travails they experience as they all grow up in the 80's and 90's. She also has a subtle wit that made me laugh out loud once or twice, but often just left me smiling as I read. The only complaint I had was that the ending scene was a bit abrupt. I would have liked a neater resolution, but this is a small quibble.
B000002KAT|3.0|I don't think so.  This is definitely a DECENT album but some of the songs really do test your patience.  \\"Madame George\\" goes on for an eternity without ever really building to any sort of climax, while Morrison's voice (which I usually enjoy) seems to grate over a few tracks (especially Beside You) that would have been perfectly all right otherwise. The quality of the CD remastering is possibly worse than those of the beatles recordings, which doesn't help.  This is in no ways a BAD album, as tracks like the magical, \\"Sweet Thing\\", \\"Astral Weeks\\" and \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" are possibly the best Morrison has ever done; it just eludes me that this is considered one of the best albums ever made when it is definitely not.
0684833395|4.0|This is exactly the sort of absurdist and strange humor I love. The Milo Minderbinder character was one of the best I've ever read about. Heller manages to mix all this outrageousness with the melancholy of loss and death that people experience in war. This book is a classic for a reason. Go ahead and read it.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|I really wish I had gone to the movies to watch this instead of buying, that way I could have walked out instead of feeling compelled to watch the whole thing to get my monies worth.  The plot is fine but the acting is so stilted and the pace of the story so slow that I would prefer to watch paint dry.  If a rating of -3 stars was available that would be my rank for this movie.
0156027321|4.0|Here's one of those metaphysical novels that are so popular these days. A year or two back, I saw people lugging this around everywhere I went, so it was time to check it out. This book is rare in that it entertains and provokes the reader's mind. The majority of the book concerns the narrator, Pi Patel, and his struggles while stranded on the Pacific Ocean with a tiger on a lifeboat. While it started a bit slow, the whole thing finishes up really strong. It got me thinking a lot about life's struggles, religion, and the triumph of the human spirit. I won't give away any more, since I want everyone to go read this.
B000002BMV|1.0|Whatz up Journey fanz!  Yesterday when I wuz jammin to da latest release by the gods of music, Limp Bizkit, this silly looking dude in an '87 Chrysler pulled up blasting some silly song about streetlight people, whatever dat meanz!  I demanded to know what it was that he was rockin out to, and he told me that it was an album called Escape by the band Journey.  So I went out and bought a copy of Escape, and let me tell ya, Journey just doesn't measure up to the musical genius of Limp Bizkit!   <br /> <br />First of all, there is no DJ in the band!  They have drums, they have guitars, and they have a bass, but a band just doesn't sound right without a DJ spinning it out on the turntables!  This Neil Schon dude thinks he can play the guitar real well, but all he can do is show off and play all those weird solos in every song.  You'd never see Wes Borland from Limp Bizkit soloing.  He's far more talented and doesn't need to show off.  Schon just uses solos to cover up his lack of talent.   The drumming and bass patterns don't even come close to Limp Bizkit, and this Jonathan Cain dude needs to put down his keyboardz and become a DJ!  The band would sound so much better if he did that.  Maybe even as good as Limp Bizkit!  <br /> <br />And whutz up with this Steve Perry dude?  He sounds like he has his b@  z stuck in a vice!  He needs to take some singing lessons from Fred Durst of the mighty Limp Bizkit!  Not only does he have a wimpy, sissyish, high pitched voice, but he can't rap either!  I listened to every song on this cd, and he doesn't drop any raps in any of the songz!   <br /> <br />You Journey fanz need to forget about Journey.  This band are a bunch of no talent hacks!  The band members can't play their instruments anywhere near as well as Limp Bizkit, the lead singer can't rap, and there is no DJ in the band.  When you put all these things togeather, you end up with one of da worst bandz eva!  When I got done listening to Escape, I took it right down to da nearest used CD shop and I traded it in for the brilliant new Limp Bizkit cd, \\"The Unquestionable Truth Pt. 1\\".  I think I'll go listen to that musical masterpiece right now!  Peace out streetlight people!
0143034545|4.0|The second book by the man behind 'Getting Things Done'. I was always against books like this in the past, simply because it seemed too New Age and touchy-feely. However, I think I can get at least a little something out of whatever I read, so I gave it a go. Man, am I glad I did. This book, along with 'Getting Things Done', might do for my organizing what 'Controlled Cheating' by Larry Goldberg did for my weight loss. I definitely recommend this one. It's filled with advice on how to become more productive by explicitly stating your goals, taking small actions to complete projects, and having the right kind of view about your tasks and schedule.
B0002X314C|5.0|I must admit, I am not really a soul or r & b person.  However, I am a sucker for great beats and catchy vocals, and whatever fits that category I go for.  When I heard the first couple of tracks on this album, I was truly shocked.  I know that Kanye produced a lot of the beats on this album, and kanye an dream team beat maker meshed with the beautiful voice of John Legend = brillance.  This album is a great example of an album where each and every track meshes all the avenues of hip hop and soul together.  If your looking for something a little lighter than the usual hip hop bad ass music, this is a definate.  This album is great for the ladies!!!!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Great Cd! Shania Twain is so talented, her music makes you feel good, always puts me in a good mood. Her songs are beautiful and fun. I reccomend the CD. Shania Twain was great here. Fans of Shania will not be disappointed in her latest work. Fans of Alison Kraus, Mindy Smith, and Deeper You Go (Higher You Fly) by Corrina Fugate will love this album.
B000003AE6|5.0|When I had this album I was not as aware as I am now. Now that Im aware I can appreciate this album a lot more than others. Sure the beats werent the best beats in the world but the message makes it one of the best albums in 1991. Trapped, Violent and I Dont Give A F*** show Tupac's depth as he speaks against this BS system. Soulja's Story is an excellent tale of Pac and his brother. Words Of Wisdom and Rebel Of The Underground are gems themselves as Tupac spits some jewels. If My Homies Call and Brenda's Got A Baby sealed the deal for me getting this album. Part Time Mutha is a beautiful story about Pac having to raise his kids and also features a sister who speaks of being molested by her father. There are no filler joints on here but people will make a big deal about the production being dated and Im not one of those people. Bottom Line: 2pacalypse Now is one of the best releases of 1991 the most misunderstood rapper in the game. This album showed that he had an awareness of things that most people havent caught on to and still havent caught on to till this day. Anybody who embraces this album and him for what was positive about him are on the right track. All those who embrace Pac for the wrong reasons shouls be ashamed of themselves. Tupac had a level of consiousness that only a few rappers back then had(Paris, Krs-One, Ice Cube, Public Enemy  and X-Clan to name a few). Standout Tracks: TRAPPED, SOULJA'S STORY, I DONT GIVE A F***, VIOLENT, WORDS OF WISDOM, CROOKED A** N***A, IF MY HOMIES CALL, BRENDA'S GOT A BABY, THA LUNATIC, REBEL OF THE UNDERGROUND, PART TIME MUTHA.<br /><br />RIP TUPAC AMARU SHAKUR. GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This by far the best CD ever.  You will play it non stop!!
B000002J23|5.0|This is the best YES album since \\"Close to the Edge\\".  Released in 1980, when disco was almost dead and MTV-type rock and pop was on its way in, this was a daringly progressive album which hooks you right from the opening riff of \\"Machine Messiah\\".  By the time it's ended with the awesome \\"Tempus Fugit\\", you're ready to play it all over again.  While Jon Anderson would seem irreplacable, Trevor Horne filled in nicely, with a high-pitched voice that proved him a worthy successor. <br /> <br />I've seen YES live (5) times since 1987.  I've always been disappointed that Anderson never learned to perform any of the songs from this album for a live show. <br /> <br />As much as I enjoyed the next YES album, \\"90125\\", it was a shame to see the band go from one musical extreme to the other, simply because musical times of the '80's were changing with the likes of Michael Jackson and Boy George (Good God!!!) <br />
B000003TAW|5.0|This cd is one of the best i own.  It is also one of the few i can listen to without even considering skipping any of the 10 tracks.  I don't think Weezer has and never will put out a cd quite like this one.  All of the songs on it are almost legendary, and when I hear any of them, I stop what I am doing just to listen to it.  Thank you Weezer for putting out such an awesome cd. Peace Out
6305736650|5.0|...well, then frankly, that's a real tragedy.  But if you do, then THIS IS IT!<br /><br />This is still my favorite black & white classic film of all time (followed very, very closely by CITIZEN KANE.  Hey, I had to chose one, right?)!<br /><br />This film is the whole reason I got a DVD player in the first place.  Nothing looks as beautiful and as crisp as classic b&w cinema.  This was the first DVD I ever bought!<br /><br />Like a Honda automobile, this film speaks for itself, so I won't waste time with a rehash of every praised word that could be said.  Let me say only that when the AFI recently did their list of the top 100 greatest movie lines of all time, CASABLANCA was chosen the most (6 times).<br /><br />Here's lookin' at you!
B000063V8R|4.0|The third season seems to be the turning point in many ST spin-offs- both TNG and DS9 became amazing once they started their third season.  <br /> <br />Stardate 43125.8 \\"Evolution\\" This is one of those annoying ones where Wesley breaks the rules and sets a disaster (this time it's tiny computeres that eat the Enterprise) loose on the ship, and then miraculously, he's the only one who can fix it.

B0006213WG|5.0|This is the best cd i have ever bought!!! (im listening to it right now! the best songs on this cd are some say, no reason, and there's no solution (aside from the popular pieces and we're all to blame. but this is the best cd i have ever bouught. the only thing i didn't like was how the songs weren't very long
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Even my kids thought this movie looked \\"old\\" and corny, sort of \\"Demetrius and The Gladiators.\\"   <br /> <br />Yes, the citizens of Troy were called Trojans but the fact is in our culture, Trojans has another connotation and you'd think the director of this film would be out the look out for hysterical lines.  Brad Pitt:  \\"Trojans never hurt ME!\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Where's Helen?\\" <br />\\"She just left with the Trojans.\\" <br /> <br />Omigod we were rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br />Orlando Bloom, such a handsome face, manages to look petite and girly-man in outfits that look like they came from a Bliss catalog. <br /> <br />Everyone wore blue and white and it all had fringe on it.  Come on already.  EVERYONE wore fringe? <br /> <br />I've never seen such bad costumes.  And such cornball delivery.   <br /> <br />Julie Christy, Peter O'Toole, they did well, you appreciate how difficult acting truly is when you see their performances against bland bland bland Brad Pitt and the girl who played Helen. <br /> <br />Orland Bloom's performance was good, but not enough to prop up such a huge cornball job like this. <br /> <br />Stick with Peter Jackson, Orlando.  As Legolas you looked taller, better built, and much more masculine. <br /> <br />I appreciate how hard making a movie really must be after watching this laugh-riot.
0385338686|4.0|Overall, I have to say I enjoyed reading Kinsella's newest book.  Her humor and wit are at their best and it was very enjoyable.  However, I did find some frustrations in some of the choices the main character, Samantha, makes.  A smart and successful laywer desperate for partnership at one of the best firms, she discovers she's made a huge error, and one that there is no coming back from.  She just leaves her office, takes a ride out to the country, lands at a large house and is mistaken for a housekeeper interviewee.  They take her on and she begins learning to cook, sew, and have a real love interest. <br /> <br />While I find some of the parts of the premis to be a little far-fetched, it isn't hard to imagine the setting because Kinsella does a wonderful job setting it up.  The book brings up some issues about feminism and the role of women in todays society - carrer oriented versus domestic specifically.  While I do believe this is subjective, to each his own, I find it hard to believe that someone with Samatha's high profile life would be completely satisfied simply cleaning someone else's house, even after a crash like that.  It felt almost as though she believed these were the only options, being high profile or a maid, when in reality there millions of options inbetween.  Without trying to give anything away, I did really like where she ended up at the very end of the book, and I thought it was very well played out. <br /> <br />As far as the developement of said love interest, I think it was very well done and what you'd hope for if you read her other books.  It was definately a fun read, and one I would recommend to her fans.
B00009VTX8|5.0|I want to start out by saying that this is probably one of the most underrated westerns ever. It hasn't got a lot of good reviews from critics but it is one of the best westerns I have ever seen (then again I haven't seen that many westerns) but in any case its really a very good movie that's well worth your time.  <br /> <br />PLOT: <br /> <br />The plot isn't anything original. A mysterious stranger(Sharon Stone) comes to the town of Redemption looking for revenge against the mayor of the town, John Herod(Gene Hackman). She arrives in time for the annual shooting contest and enters it after saving a preacher named Cort(Russell Crowe) from being killed by Herod. Herod enters Cort in the contest along with himself. Other assorted characters also enter the contest including: Herod's son, the Kid, Ace Hanlon, who can talk a good game but can't quite back it up, Sgt. Clay Cantrell, a hired killer, Spotted Horse, an indian who claims that he can't be killed by a bullet and few others. The plot is predictable and anyone who has ever watched a western has seen this kind of thing before but it's a great movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br />CAST: <br /> <br />Sharon Stone: I'm not a big Sharon Stone fan but she gave a much better performance than I thought she would in this role. She's sort of reminds one of Clint Eastwood in the Dollars Trilogy and High Plains Drifter. But whereas Eastwood never showed much vulnerability Stone lets her character be vulnerable and show doubts and fear. <br /> <br />Gene Hackman: Hackman gives another great performance as John Herod, the evil boss of the town. I've always thought Hackman was a better villain than hero and this movie shows him in one of his best villainous roles. He is truly heartless and remorseless. <br /> <br />Russell Crowe: This is one Crowes earlier performances before he became a huge star. Crowe always turns in a solid performance and this is no different. He plays a outlaw turned preacher named Cort. He usedto run with Herod's gang but is now a man of peace but is forced into killing or being killed. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio: I'm also not the biggest DiCaprio fan in the world but he almost stole the movie in his role as Herod's son the Kid. He did a great job as a cocky young gunfighter who only really wants his fathers respect. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast gave solid performances in their roles as well. Standouts include Lance Henriksen as Ace Hanlon and Keith David as Sgt. Clay Cantrell. <br /> <br />CONTENT: <br /> <br />There is some bad language here but not a whole lot and there is violence of course but it's not very graphic. There is also a very brief split second of nudity that I only noticed during the third time I saw this so it's nothing to really get upset about. <br /> <br />FINAL WORD: <br /> <br />This a great movie that deserves a better reputation than it's got. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"Metal Man\\",    You sound like you're 12. Grow up. Don't be so judgemental about other people's taste in music. The millions of people out there who love Coldplay have their reasons. We shouldn't have to explain to you why \\"this album rules\\". If you listened to it, and you don't like it, so be it and don't buy it. Noone is making you. Since you're \\"Metal Man\\", I'm going to assume you like metal. Well, that's a hint right there that you probably won't like Coldplay's genre...I could be wrong. Anyways, I'm not dissing you because you've listened to the album and don't like it, I'm dissing you because you sound like an idiot. Mick Jagger and Steven Tyler are both old, and they still \\"rock hard\\". I'm 20, I've been to one of Coldplay's concerts, and believe me, it's mostly people our age. I'm also not sure why you included the whole buying it used at a cd store bit. Sounds like you want to buy the album but you're just too cheap to do so. For other people reading this, I'm sorry I posted this and wasted your time. As for the album, I think it rules.    Oh by the way, your review made me laugh so hard, I read another one of your recent reviews. This is what you wrote:    \\"This CD RULES W/O QUESTION!!!! There is no comparison to a great band like this. There lyrics are some of the most intellengent and powerful/potient I've ever seen in a band. The riffs and solos showcased on this cd take the cake! The vocals rip you something new everytime he speaks! Songs 1,2,3,4,and 5 are awesome and so are the rest of the songs w/1 and 5 being my personal favs. If you want metal then check out Lamb of God!! THEY FREAKIN RULE!!!\\"    I guessed you told the rest of us why you think they rule. Deep man, real deep...and potient.
B000244EMO|5.0|Forget politics for now. Even now, \\"Predator\\" is arguably one of my favorite action-science fiction classics that I still watch today.<br /><br /> Set somewhere in the treacherous jungles of South America, a team of U.S. commandos are sent down there to rescue a band of government officials who've been kidnapped by a squad of heavily armed insurgents in South America and a war ensues between. However, after the skirmish, both the U.S. commandoes and their South American foes start being killed, one by one by an unseen enemy that is not even of this world.<br /><br /> Now with both his comrades and enemies alike being killed off one by one, Dutch now is facing off against a deadly foe that is not a sniper but actually an alien that landed on earth and hunts for the sake of it.<br /><br /> Arnold is excellent once again as the macho protagonist main character in an action movie. In case you didn't know, the guy who played blain is Jesse Ventura! Both of them would go on to become governors. Arnold is governor of California and Jesse was governor of Minnesota for a period of time. While I've had mixed opinions of their views, I still love watching them in their roles in \\"Predator\\".<br /><br /> Although the age does show in some spots, the special effects are absolutely impressive especially taking into account that this was 1987! The way they did the extra-terrestrial being's face and scary looking mouth was awesome and gave me nightmares for a long time after first seeing the movie.<br /><br /> Highly recommended!
0767903862|4.0|The books Bill Bryson produces really are more of a 'Bill Bryson' book, then a book about the topic it coveres. Don't expect anything too philosophical or profound, but Bryson can express such keen interest in things that he can make anything interesting and accesible to a greater public. As ever, Bryson's account on Australia is an open minded, fair and factual one, mixed with the usual knacks for small and every day wonders, down-to-earth observations, forgotten events, poisonous beasts, overlooked hero's, expensive hotels and off course that were it all comes down to: food and beverages. You'll like it, and probably a lot too.
B0007PALSE|5.0|Although I sadly never got to see it on the big screen, I finally got to see it on cable and WOW! \\"I Robot\\" is a suprisingly great movie and among the best that Will Smith has done in recent years.<br /><br /> Set in Chicago around the summer of 2035 (I'll be 52 then), a scientist named Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) is found dead after going through an office window and falling to his death in the lobby of the corporate headquarters. An agent who is highly technophobic (spiteful of advanced technology, preferring 'old-fashioned' lifestyles) decides to find out who commited the crime and believes that the perpetrator of the crime was in fact one of the 'modern' robots that was designed by Lanning.<br /><br /> The acting is absolutely great in this movie. Although I'm skeptical of Chicago looking like that at that point, I loved the way that they made Chicago look in this time frame with the John Hancock and Sears Towers still standing out despite the looming heights of the corporate headquarters. The look also was great to see with the 'L' trains although I'm not too sure about the 'expressway' in relation to the Sears Tower. If it was the Eisenhower Expressway in there, it would be farther south unless they upgraded Lake or Madison Avenues into elevated expressways. Other than that, the look of CHicago in 2035 is great!<br /><br /> The special effects are excellent and not too overdone. While not necessarily a 'thinker's movie, \\"I Robot\\" is sometimes unsettling in the way it makes one wonder if robot technology advances to the point that even they can think independently in the same patterns that the human brain can although the human brain is FAR too complex to duplicate in even todays most advanced technology.<br /><br /> Anyhow, \\"I Robot\\" is a great summer popcorn flick and is definately a movie worth checking out, if not buying. I guarantee it. Well done Will! I look forward to more movies from you man! :)
B00005AUBA|5.0|Anybody who hasn't heard Mogwai, and is looking to get into them should buy this album, as in terms of Mogwai's outstanding ability to create gorgeous tracks, this throws you right in at the deep end.<br /><br />Personally my favourite album by the band, closely followed by Happy Songs... I beleive the music contained on this CD is Mogwai incarnate, as it is almost perfect, delivering spine tingling explosions of sound that will never leave you, and it's amazing that every time you hear these songs a new noise or layer becomes apparent, which adds the overwhelmingly simple complexity of it all - never before have I heard such a technically simple album with so much to offer (being a fan of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Converge to name a couple).<br /><br />Also, along with all the praises I've attached to the album so far, it has an unairing ability to put you in a reflective mood as soon as it starts, and is great to listen to if you need to think about something or reminis to... it's THAT powerful.<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the best albums I have heard, if not 'the' best!<br /><br />The only problem with this album is that it is to short, which makes it less than perfect, otherwise it would be - but if, nay, WHEN you want more after hearing this album, move onto Happy Songs For Happy People!<br /><br />Buy this album, you will never be sorry and these timeless songs will never fail to impress you. Ever!
B000001EMW|3.0|so, this is a good cd and all, possibly something interesting to put on at a party to impress your friends or something, but after listening to it more than maybe once or twice, it's nothing more than mere novelty. definitely buy it used, and don't say i didn't warn you about the novelty part. <br />-chris-
6303441378|5.0|What a combination! Muppets and a Dicken's classic rolled up into one. It's the same Dicken's classic with the Muppets original songs and funny style. My children have almost worn out our copy. We loved it so much that we bought the soundtrack CD. I highly recommend it to everyone. An unforgettable movie.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|This one was one of my first dvd buys of a band in concert. And I was amazed. The dvd is amazing, and the cd that comes with it is great too. My only pet peeve is that the cd does not have all the songs that were included on the dvd, (obviously due to time constraints.) If you are a fan of Coldplay, or if you are just getting into their music, than this is a must have, trust me, you'll be hooked after hearing this. <br />-Chris-
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Disappointing adaptation of the Hellblazer comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very bad performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two matrix films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. He not only sucks the life out of every scene he's in but manages to bring the film down to his level of acting in certain scenes. Director Frances Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it. I would have liked to have learn more about her character and her relationship with her sister, which would have been a much better movie than this film was if they just could have based the film around her character instead of John Constantine. Djmon Hounsou, who was so great in the film \\" In America\\" only has a bit part here and he does well with it but I would have rather had him play a much bigger role than he was allowed to play in this film. Peter Stormare, who was so great in the movies \\"Birth\\" and \\"Chocolat\\", gives quite an unusual take of the devil. Unfortunately, he's not in the movie very much at all. The special effects are good but the way hell is represented here is more a variation of the sets that was used in the film than something completely original. It's a decent film if you're in the mood for this kind of movie but I you will end up thinking that it could have been better once it's over.  <br />

B000929AJQ|5.0|Something interesting happens during the first track of Nine Inch Nail's \\"With Teeth,\\" titled \\"All the Love in the World.\\"  Trent Reznor lightens up.      In this song, Trent Reznor's voice is elevated beyond his usual roar of apathetic angst and enters into an area of romantic crooning - something absolutely different than what he normally does.  Is it shocking?  Yes, but more importantly, it's enjoyable.    The force behind industrial-rock revolutionary band Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has growled and screamed through three studio albums, ten remix albums, several EPs, and a truly angsty live album ever since the band hit the mainstream in 1989 with its first studio album, \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\"      Throughout the course of listening to \\"With Teeth\\", the band's signature sound of mixing heavy industrial-rock samplings with catchy melodies emanates from beginning to end.  No other song honors this sound better than the album's outstanding first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds You\\", with its pulsating drumming provided by Foo Fighters frontman David Grohl and its politically-driven lyrics.      The majority of the songs are guitar-heavy rock anthems, very similar in style to the band's EP \\"Broken\\" (1992) and the more heavy offerings of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (1994).  Most fans will feel pleased by this musical direction; the band's last full-length studio album, \\"The Fragile,\\" took the band's sound into a more atmospheric, sublime realm, alienating fans of the band's earlier work.    Reznor went on the record saying that \\"With Teeth\\" would be more \\"song-orientated,\\" unlike \\"The Fragile\\" (1999), which showed more of a focus on dreamy instrumentals spread out between two illustrious disks.  The goal for \\"With Teeth\\" was for each song to sound different than each other, but the album falls short of this goal in the middle stretch.  After \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" each song blends into each other, one large mish-mash of gloomy guitar riffs and percussion.  Luckily, the amazing quality of the album's industrial sound sampling helps the album sound much different than your average rock album, to the benefit of music listeners everywhere.     Though there are similarities between this album and other Nine Inch Nails efforts, the `feel' of the album is completely different, as it normally is between Nine Inch Nails studio albums.  Each song feels much more dense and lyric-heavy than the band's other albums - both a good and a bad thing.  Density equates to the fact that singing accompanies almost every part of each song, and the instrumentals seems to be more focused on servicing the melody.  Sadly, this eliminates some of the sincerity of earlier songs in the band's catalogue; none of the songs reach the sonic majesty of \\"Into the Void's\\" solemn opening or the aching desolation of \\"The Frail.\\"     Luckily, starting with the second-to-last track \\"Beside You in Time,\\" the album enters a much more musically dynamic `zone,' focusing on interesting instrumentals and dreamy vocal looping.  The album ends with \\"Right Where it Belongs\\", an epic personal confessional that ends with a staged live performance.      Even though \\"With Teeth\\" may not be as dynamic as the band's earlier entries, this is a no-brainer for Nine Inch Nails fans and fans of music from any genre.  If you're looking for a more artistically interesting Nine Inch Nails album, any of the other studio albums are sure bets.  But, more than any of the other albums in the band's discography, \\"With Teeth\\" is deadly consistent from beginning to end.  The journey might not go to as many interesting places as before, but that doesn't mean the journey is any less enjoyable.     Dualdisc Extras:  \\"With Teeth\\" has been given the Dualdisc treatment just like \\"The Downward Spiral\\" did last year.  The best feature of the Dualdisc content is a complete discography (or `halography') for Nine Inch Nails, with selected video/song samples.  This is a great bonus for Nine Inch Nails newbies, but pretty useless for the hardcore fans (except for the exert from the extra-rare \\"Closure\\" VHS, Halo 12).    Also included is the video for \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" which gives fans a glimpse of the post-rehab Trent Reznor rocking with his new band members.  Otherwise, this Dualdisc leaves much to be desired.  With it only costing a couple dollars extra than the standard version, though, the Dualdisc version should be the way to go.  Unless you're like me and you feel weird about handling dual-sided disks.      (...)
B000003TA4|4.0|This album is ok, Smells Like Teen Spirit would be the best song<br /><br />on this, other radio classics would be In Bloom, Come as You Are,<br /><br />& Lithium. Other than those 4, it is rather the weakest CD yet!!<br /><br />I'll rate this CD 4 stars because this is great for those 4.

B00001U0DP|5.0|I first watched this movie in the Spring of 1999.  It was a pivotal time in my life, and the movie fit the period.  At first, I laughed until I cried.  And then...I cried.  I never cry at movies; I laughed during Titanic, only one part got me on Beaches, I hated The Notebook (it was the second movie to make me cry).  The characters in Life is Beautiful are all too real, and human.  It puts a face on something that for many of us is only a memory to our parents and grandparents.  The Holocaust and World War II was one of the scariest times in American history, but oh, how soon we forget.  Life is Beautiful has the capacity to remind us.  I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 11.  The subject line is too deep for too many children.  I have not seen the movie in its entirety since that day over six years ago, but this movie changed my life.  I believe that good movies entertain, as well as teach you something.  Life is Beautiful definitely did both.
0552149519|1.0|This book only confirmed my belief that the Best Seller list is nothing more than a trendy reading list for people who don't know how to read. And by \\"don't know how to read\\", I mean the increasing throng of individuals who lack the imagination or patience to search for a truly good read. Which this was not.<br /><br />Several readers have made the point that this was a good idea in the hands of an incapable writer. That is putting it almost politely. In a nut shell the story was convoluted, grandiose and poorly written; was Christ a judao-Christian or a goddess worshiping pagan? Dan Brown doesn't seem to know but he is determined to be shocking it's just too bad he isn't the writer to do it.<br /><br />While reading this I kept having flashbacks to other authors I have read who have covered similar material in their works: Arturo Perez-Reverte, Phil Rickman, Merlin Stone, Barbara Walker, etc. even the X-Files. I can't even accuse Dan Brown of ripping off from these people, because based on what I read I couldn't imagine him to be even remotely aware of their existence despite his \\"heavy research\\".<br /><br />The topic is neither a shock, or controversial at this point in time. In fact the biggest offense about the story is that it follows the worst mystery plot-line to ever be developed: i.e. the hapless hero/heroine who accidentally falls into a terrible situation and bungles their way through to the end. The fact that both lead characters are supposed to be \\"experts in their fields\\" just makes their idiocy that much more frustrating and unforgivable.<br /><br />And Heaven help us they are going to make a movie with a miscast Tom Hanks. Yet in a way this makes since the book was clearly written in a movie format and the quality of the story would make for an amusing 2 hours on a made for television program. However I can't help but feel that unless a REALLY good screen writer does some serious re-vamping, this will be another waste of money thrown at the big-screen.ig-screen. <br />
B00020HEL6|1.0|It is total crap. Children pretending to be adult....
0312323859|5.0|loved the book!!! almost as much as the first one ...i can't wait for the third....
B000687M48|4.0|This dvd features the ever popular band Evanescence performing live in paris on a spot where they call the Zenith. Although there are a lot of songs on the dvd and cd, most of actual concert is edited roughly and cut back on a lot of things. And the fact that Amy Lee keep bobbing up and down does not help. She should focus more on her singing instead of dancing widly around like a crazed rocker.  <br />The bonus features however, is a different story. It features 4 great Evanescence music videos and over an hour behind the scene with the band itself. This part was personally my favorite out of the whole dvd, not only did you get to see Amy and the rest of the band on their tour, you get exclusive looks at bloopers, deleted scenes and before the concert preparation.  <br />I would recommend this dvd to those of you out there who are obsessive evanescence fans, after all, the bonus features how the band really act. But for those who just like evanescence by and by, it's probably not a good idea to buy this right away. Instead, you should wait until the dvd goes on sale to get it. <br /> <br />Also recommend: Linkin Park cds and dvds
B0000YEEGM|5.0|My favorite movie.  Can't believe how excellent D. Hoffman's performance is, as well as T. Cruise and all others.  I saw this movie with my parents when I was 18,which was 17 years ago and to this day, we still talk about Rain Man as our fave movie.  So many funny quotes and mannerisms of the characters.  Beautiful soundtrack as well.  Glad to have it on dvd.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Having bought all of Shakiras previous CD's, I knew that this one would be great.  I had no idea!  This is easily her best one and has a variety of styles making this her best one yet.  I put it in my CD cassette in my car, but I seem have a hard time listening to the other CD's in there.  I love Shakiras voice and she doesn't let you down here.  Although a long time coming, it is worth the wait.
B000002JOH|5.0|I got into Pantera when i was back in high school.At first it was hard to listen to this album because rap was all the rage back then.But as my friend let me borrow this cd,it ended making a fan of me.This album has gritty but just plain awesome instrumentals espeacially by the late-great Dimebag Darrel's legendary guitar work.It is just sad that we will never seen him light up the stage at Ozzfest.But at least his legacy will forever live.R.I.P
B00005JN0T|4.0|Wize cracking Will Smith and the special effects are the reasons to watch this movie. The plot is simple, the acting from the \\"hold on!\\" school of action films but the special effects are spectacular and carry the movie. Probably not one of the best movies ever made but a hoot none the less. Will Smith and Sci-Fi fans (and I am one)will enjoy this one.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I am shocked with this album to the core.  <br />Honestly speaking being of latin decent i knew of her, but never thought much of her English speaking music.  <br />Then she came along with this album, and has left my fixated with her.  <br />The album has got to be one of the best albums that have had release in 2005.  <br />The versatility and delicacy with the album, really does reflect on the fact that Shakira undoubtedly has and is the most famous Latin artist to come out of the 21st century. Im sure that many people will dispute it, but this is my opinion.  <br />La Tortura and the new No video are both amazing.  <br />The only thing i wish is that there were more tracks on the album. But then Oral Fixation Vol 2. Will be out in november, and hopefully there is a little bit of Spanish tracks on there as well. lol.  <br />If i could give the album more stars i would.  <br />This is def a classic, and one that i will always keep with me on my journeys.
0920668364|5.0|I remember reading this book about 17 years ago and as a gift, I gave this book to my mother.  Since her english is a bit limited, I translated this book for her from page to page.  When I was done reading it, we both shed tears and gave each other a hug...this just goes to show no matter what background you are, a mother's love for her child is the strongest bond there is.
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|I love this group but this disc is not what they say it is---it is not really 5.1 sound.  The inside notes say there is some sort of automatic 5.1 converter they used.  This album was never remixed into 5.1 properly but just run through some 5.1 generator that makes 5.1 out of stereo recordings...lame. I listened to it at home and was very dissappointed.    Just to make it clear, I am a big fan of their music and I recommend it, but the included dvd is sub-par. The regular cd also included is great.  Seeing as how I bought it just for the 5.1 dvd, I felt very, very unsatisfied.
B00023B1A8|5.0|This is a great reminder of how sweet music with a message can sound.  CSN (and sometimes Y) provided us a link between street corner harmonies, hard CA guitar, and modern sensibilities.  OK, it's an act as I sing and not a do as I do, but still CSN provided us with some of the most lyrical songs in 40 years.  This is such a great concert because it captures that spirit of joy in performing and singing the song.  They're all smiling and having fun and it's infectious.  You can't help yourself by toe tapping and signing along.  You may need to turn the music up a bit higher because you no longer could hit those high notes that you thought that you once could; but, the spirit of joy in and from the song are brought back to the stage by CSN.
0385513755|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, not just for the illustrations, but the manuscript as well.  The pictures showing the various paintings was very helpful.  They would have been very helpful in Angels and Demons, had I know that it came illustrated.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is my favorite film version of \\"Dracula.\\"  Don't get me wrong, I know where it differs from the novel and I am a huge fan of Bela Lugosi's work.  However, there's just something great about this movie.  Peter Cushing is THE Van Helsing.  He plays the part to perfection.  And Christopher Lee is very dark and believable as Dracula.  This movie, though differing from the novel, stays true enough to the story, has a great gothic atmosphere and is very entertaining.  It is the essential Hammer horror in my opinion, and is not to be missed by any fan of horror films.  Make sure to check out other Hammer horrors starring these two, including \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" \\"The Curse of Frankenstein,\\" \\"The Mummy,\\" and so many more.
0385338686|5.0|The Undomestic Goddess is yet anotherwinner from Sophie Kinsella. I read the book in a day and a half because it was a easy fun read. Samantha Sweeting is a hard working lawyer who is on her way to being made a partner at her firm-until she makes a mistake. Samantha then panics and goes into the English countryside. Samantha is mistaken for a housekeeper and she can't seem to find a way to tell her employers Trish and Eddie the truth. So she struggles to learn to cook and clean and this leads to some funny situations. I believe that another amazon.com reviewer said that they found it hard to believe that she became a \\"world class chef\\" so quickly, but I didn't find that to be true. She learns to cook but I don't know if I would classify as a her cooking as world class chef cooking. I found the love story in the book to be very sweet. Although, I personally liked the Shopaholic series and Can you keep a secret?, The Undomestic Goddess is a good funny book and I recommend it to anyone who likes Sophie Kinsella and anyone who is a fan of chic-lit books.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I liked their first album better, but that doesn't mean I don't like this one. I feel that this album had a darker, less happier feel to it. I think all Gorilla fans will like this album like they did the first album. Also pay attention to the album art. <br /> <br />Intro - Sounds like it came straight out of a movie soundtrack with a mysterious dark feel to it.  <br /> <br />Last Living Souls - A slower song, sounds a little child tune-ish, but it is decent.   <br /> <br />Kids With Guns  - I realy like Albarn's vocals on this. It matches so well with the mood of the song...it's slow and somewhat mellow but it works well. <br />  <br />O Green World - a little similar to 5/4 on their first album. I think it would appeal to the Gorillaz fans who like their rock side. <br /> <br />Dirty Harry  - I've seen many people who say they really like this song. No doubt that it has a good beat and it will attract a lot of people. Hip hop groove orientated. There are some child/childish vocals on here too.I can picture it being a single.  <br /> <br />Feel Good Inc. - Popular song inc. EVERY gorillaz fan and a lot of non-gorillaz fans already do or will like this song. It's probably one of the best Gorillaz came up with. A very addictive beat and melody. The rap part works well in it too. You have most likely heard it also on an iPod commercial. <br /> <br />El Manana - Nice guitar work...I can see it being favored. <br />       <br />Every Planet We Reach Is Dead  - This song sounds very Rage Against the Machine without being very hard rock. Sounds like a funk rock type of song.  <br /> <br />November Has Come - One of my favorites on here. Nice hip hop feel without being abrasive at all. I think it's a beautiful song, you have to listen to it to see what I mean. <br /> <br />All Alone  - I love the bass in this song and I like the rap along with Albarn's sad sounding voice saying \\"all alone\\". I also love the middle dreamy, harp part in the song...you would think it wouldn'tfit, but it works very well.  <br /> <br />White Light  - My personal favorite on this album even though the entire song pretty much consists of the lyrics \\"white light alcohol\\". It has a sharp beat to it and very punkish. I love it. <br /> <br />DARE - It took me a while to like this song...the first time I heard it, I didn't like it at all and I couldn't believe they turned it into a single. I do like it now. Very modern dancy. <br /> <br />Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head - Has a moody beat at points, but also sounds a little like a folk song. It's calm and not abrasive at all. <br /> <br />Don't Get Lost in Heaven - Seems like a dreamy old British-rock (and without much guitar) type of song. It sounds charming though. <br /> <br />Demon Days - Sounds a little strange, but very vocal orientated and  feels a little spaced out. <br /> <br />Chances are if you didn't like their first album, you won't like this. However, I think most Gorillaz will like this one. <br />
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I think this review will be of interest to most people. I'm one of the few people who never saw \\"Mary Poppins\\" as a child. You read that right. I saw it recently for the first time on DVD and here are my impressions of it: firstly, I don't know if I enjoyed this film as much as I would have if I had first seen it as a child. The movie is clearly intended for kids. Yet the film has a wonderful, infectious quality to it. You don't have to be a kid to appreciate it. \\"Mary Poppins\\" is a truly unforgettable film. It has so many things going for it. First is Julie Andrews, who won an Oscar for Best Actress as Mary herself, and who demonstrates supreme self-confidence in this her first starring role.  The film also won an Oscar for Best Special Effects in 1964; the technology to combine live-action footage with animation has since been surpassed (notably in \\"Who framed Roger Rabbit?\\") but it's never been used more effectively than here: that wonderful sequence where Dick Van Dyke dances with a quartet of animated penguins still holds up forty years after it was filmed. Unquestionably, however, the film's greatest asset is its musical score by the Sherman brothers and that score is simply a knockout. Songs like \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" and \\"Jolly Holiday\\" are instant classics; once you hear them you will never forget them. And a song like \\"Feed the Birds\\" about the old woman who sits on the steps of St. Paul's cathedral and sells bags of crumbs to feed the birds is truly affecting (\\"though her words are simple and few/ Listen, listen, she's calling to you...\\"). I don't see how anyone can hear a song like that and fail to be touched by it. The film does have its problems: the film's plot is relatively slight: basically, an oblivious and paternalistic father learns to stop being so oblivious and paternalistic.  Indeed, the film's plot comes off as a kind of ad hoc improvisation by the film's creators, just an excuse to string together a series of otherwise-unrelated episodes. Also, the character of Mary has, to my mind, a fundamental flaw (inherited, I believe, from the source material itself, i.e. Pamela Travers' books). It's never really explained why Mary is magical as opposed to any of the other characters.  Apparently, we're just supposed to accept it on principle that Mary Poppins is magical because the movie says she is and then work backwards from that proposition. But all things considered these objections are relatively minor.  The movie generates such joy and good feeling that these things really win the day. One last point: I was aware, prior to having seen the film, that it had gotten a bad rap as \\"treacle\\", \\"syrupy-sweet\\", etc. Not true. What \\"Mary Poppins\\" is is wholesome. It has a simplicity and an innocence to it that you just don't see in movies nowadays. Perhaps we live in a more cynical time. Pity.
B0009ML238|5.0|I don't write reviews for albums on Amazon.com normally, mostly because once I start writing, I can't stop. I wanted to say that it is my opinion that this album is beyond spectacular. I work in a music store in Connecticut, MA, and every time I play this album over the speakers, it sells, or at least arouses the interest of customers. <br /> <br />The main reason I wanted to write this review, however, is to say this: Yea, there are similarities between this band and Dream Theater. But people really should just stop pointing that out. Every modern progressive metal band will sound like, or at least have elements of, Dream Theater. Why is this? It's due to the fact that Dream Theater took all the styles of the 70's prog greats (Kansas, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Gentle Giant, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, etc.) and combined them together to make their music. It is therefore IMPOSSIBLE for a modern progressive metal act not to sound like Dream Theater. Don't get me wrong, I love Dream Theater. They revived the progressive genre by perhaps the only means possible, and they sounded excellent doing it. I don't care who sounds like who; If it's good, then it's good, and that's that. These newer progressive bands aren't necessarily trying to emulate Dream Theater; they just have the same influences. And so what if they sound similar to Dream Theater!? If you like Dream Theater, then you like Circus Maximus, Ice Age, Threshold, Shadow Gallery, Pagan's Mind, Ivory Tower, Dreamscape, and on and on. Every one of those bands also has their own sounds that they bring to the table. they are by not \\"Dream Theater clones.\\" Circus Maximus is heavier with a lot of Emerson, Lake & Palmer elements, Pagan's Mind is much heavier and honestly has better guitar work (amazing!), Threshold has a much more British feel and is more hard-rock than metal, and Shadow Gallery is softer and a bit more emotional with a lot of piano work and create soothing soundscapes. Stop crying about it, buy the albums, and enjoy them. You can find all sorts of sites, especially the groups' homepages, where you can sample the music. Look at them as something to be appreciated at face value, and don't worry about who they sound like. That's what makes a genre. Groups of bands that all sound similar. And for my money, Circus Maximus' debut is better than anything Dream Theater has released in years. Perhaps even better than Images & Words, and if not, then just as good. If you are looking for bands in the progressive metal genre that are of a bit of a differnt style from Dream Theater and their \\"clones,\\" as you may like to call them, check out Artension, Andromeda, Ark, Evergrey, etc. <br /> <br />This review was not meant to piss anybody off. If it did, and you are someone who wrote a review that this review was targeting, then just think of how much your reviews piss the people off that love these bands that you call \\"Dream Theater wannabes.\\"
078322611X|5.0|This is a fantastic film, fantasy, heartwarming, and indulging. First off, this film was filmed where I live, Dubuque, Iowa, was the double for downtown Boston, Dyersville, Iowa is where the field is, and still is to this day. Galena, Illinois, a quick 15 min. drive is \\"Docs home town.\\" I don't love this film because it was filmed here, I love the meaning to it. I lost my father years ago, and wish I could have a last chance to chat, this film truly touches the heart. I tear up everytime at the ending, and I'm 38 years old. Some people don't get it, ease his pain, is Ray, ( Costner), the whole film, voices are all for Ray, he doesn't know it,(neither do we), remarkable ending. Also, my car is the 23rd one driving to the field at the ending. Some good friends from school played the ghost players, and I got to party with Timothy Busfield for an evening, hell of a nice guy. The visuals are great, soundtrack is awesome, and the film delivers. Last word, people love The Wizard the Oz, this too is makebelieve, but that is what films are for.....too escape, indulge, let go, and believe. This is a great film, well worthy of it's Oscar nominataion for best picture. Enjoy, and Iowa does rule. Visit Dversville, Iowa, and see this magical place. You can play ball, run the bases, visit the gift shops, sit on the swing in the film, and even the lights are still there. This site is well maintaned and kept up. People visit from all over the world. Personally, my first at bat, I struck out, 0-well, no cameras were involved.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|or how ever his name is spelt. The funny thing is I cant stand hyim as an actor but gave it a viewing and was suprised by what a solid movioe it was. I was impressed im not a fan of K.R or horror made these days but it was not bad at all . To see all these 2 star reviews is interesting. A movie worth checking out, I wouldnt buy it i have thought about it but wont, but definitley woth the rent and viewing enjoyable check it out a cool flick. <br /> <br />the only funny thing is , is that K.Reaves, in every movie sounds and looks and acts exactly the same the facial expression and voice tone never ever changes, ever. he is just a horrible actor, but  the overalll goodness of the picture made up for K.R being so horrible like always.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|When Season 3 of Enterprise began, I was extremely anxious to see these new villains, the Xindi. Finding out that there were 5 species of Xindi floored me, but I was amazed by the CGI work for the Xindi-Insectoids and Xindi-Aquatics, as well as the makeup design for the Reptilians and Arboreals, though the Primates weren't too different from us. But then, aren't humans a higher form of primate? <br />Enterprise also went in a slightly new direction by introducing the MACOs, as well as T'Pol resigning her commission with the Vulcan High Command, and getting a new look. <br />The first first few episodes of the season were a little slow at times for my taste, but then the action picked up and the third season experienced a type of action-adventure not seen since Deep Space Nine's Dominion War, culminating in a 3-episode battle to the season's finale, which opened up another amazing storyline into the 4th season, which was unfortunately, the last. <br />I'm not going to provide a summary of each episode, as other reviewers have done this already.   <br />However, it saddens me to note that Star Trek has ended (aside from the fan-mader series), due to a lack of interest. It disheartens me to think that people have come to like those garbage reality shows like 'Survivor' and 'Real Gilligan's Island', not to mention all of the even trashier titles in that genre.   What has happened to us that we are superhypercritical of every episode of a show, when we used to be able to just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and get swept away in the story, and ENJOY it? <br /> <br />Send a message to Hollywood. Stock up on DVDs of GOOD shows, and boycott these awful reality shows. <br /> <br />I intend to spend many hours enjoying Season 3 of Enterprise, and I hope you will too.
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|This movie was made for TV, but still got on R rating on DVD.  This is probably because of the marijuana smoking the bad high school athlete does in the boys bathroom at one point.  Otherwise, even the violence doesn't have that Hollywood graphic detail.  The characters in this film display the sexual mores of, well, they don't.<br /><br />Tom Selleck is very good as Jesse Stone, the run down big city cop who brings his problems to be the chief of police in a small town where the duties are small and his foibles can be indulged without hurting anyone.  His best friend is Abby Taylor (Polly Shannon) and she is one of the best things in the movie.<br /><br />The movie opens with one of the town's few policemen finding a murdered corpse and a live dog.  As the movie progresses there are more murders and it becomes clear that these are the work of a serial killer.  Another plot involves a young schoolgirl who is raped whose mother wants the perpetrators punished, but everything kept confidential because of the shame her family would suffer in such a small town.  The girl caught between her family, the boys who did this to her, and just trying to survive her teenage years.  Jesse does his best to help her as does another policewoman, Molly Crane (Viola Davis).<br /><br />It is a decent movie, but just moves so slowly.  I guess that is to evoke the pace of a small town.  The music emphasizes how quiet and slow everything is as well.  Even at 87 minutes, the movie seems full length.  The performances are good, the story isn't special, but not bad.  Still it takes so much time to get things done.  I would love to have learned more about the personal lives of some of the minor characters and more background on Jesse.  Instead, we get to see a lot of contemplating and drinking of whiskey without much dramatic point to it.<br /><br />If you enjoy seeing Tom Selleck on the screen, and he is always enjoyable to watch, then this is worth the hour and a half.
B00005JL3A|3.0|-- One more time.<br /><br />It's pretty good of its kind. You know, the UnDead walk the earth (stumble, mostly), driven only by the urge to chomp on anyone not yet of their kind. Genus: scary monster movie, Species: undead zombie, Distinguishing features: Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />'Resident Evil' does a pretty fair job. This time, the cause is is a virus cooked up in secret labs by The Evil Corporation, tapping into more modern kinds of fears and kinds of bad guys. (Give the movie a little time, and your idea of who's bad might change.) The action is strong, continuous, and well paced, with one more surprise in every scene, right up to the end. That ending, of course, sets up the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />Since they followed the recipe for a good monster/action flick, not a lot could go wrong. Milla's babe appeal spiced up the mix in a few places, especially near the end, but could have been used more. The movie dishes out big servings of action, served with a side of gore. In the end, though, the result lacks flavor. I enjoyed watching it, but it never really rises above its genre.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0006U4UAU|4.0|It's rare that a band comes along with equal respect for the genres of rock and dance. On the one hand, you have the rock bands that buy a synth and play disco beats and somehow that makes them \\"electronic\\" such as the Killers, or the other side is the dance bands that add a little guitar to be more \\"rock\\" like Fischspooner.  <br /> <br />Honestly, I think both side are alright but if you are gonna blend, use equal parts and stand proudly on the line :)  <br /> <br />This record is the next step in paving that path for musicians such as myself who feel it is okay to stand on the line and not be rock or dance, but a beautiful mix of the both. <br /> <br />Solid tracks (besides the singles) include \\"I'm losing my edge\\" which lyrically is genius. I mean a line like \\"these kids can name every member of every good band between 1962 and 1978\\", only comes out once in a great while. Also check out \\"beat connection\\", \\"never as tired as when i'm waking up\\", and \\"thrills\\".  <br /> <br />If can really dig this stuff, check out other similar \\"trash pop\\"  bands like Junior Senior.
B000A88F22|5.0|After seeing Chaotic, I will never watch \\"Newlyweds\\" again! It was so refreshing to see a reality show that was REAL!!! Britney is probably one of the most random, funny celebrities you could ever hope to see... She even shows off decent opera skills in a scene in Spain! As a guy and a Britney fan, I used to HATE Kevin Federline with a passion, but this show reveals how much he cares about the pop princess herself! The show is full of exciting footage from her dazzling ONYX HOTEL TOUR, and will have you laughing you head off! The bonus songs are both very good and \\"Someday (I will understand)\\" shows off Britneys maturing vocals! If you are looking for a sugar-coated piece of fluff, this is not for you... BUT if you are looking to see the real, raw, truth behind the most talked about romance of 2004, this is for you! It is real, raw, entertaining, and truthful! Can we handle Britney's truth? You bet we can!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Don't think of it as a western. Don't think of it as sci-fi. Think of it as a stellar television. I wasn't able to catch it when it was on the air, what with the numerous pre-emptions and bad timeslot and I didn't think it was a huge deal. Why would I want to watch a space western for? Sure, it's Joss Whedon, but was it really going to be any good to people the genre didn't attract?<br />The answer was a resounding 'yes'. I bought the series after the end of Angel and only on a whim, because I missed Joss Whedon's storytelling. I was afraid of being disapointed. I was a complete idiot. <br />I've since been compelled to sit, write and send a letter of apology to Mister Whedon (and who has time for that?) for having doubted him when the show first came on. So have the three friends I've lent the DVD to. You know the show is good when you cringe as you hand the pretty box-set over. I had to buy 2 copies. <br />Whoever gives this a chance will find it worthwhile. No question.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I was lucky enough to have seen this live in Chicago last month. I knew it would be good because these two bands are legendary but I didn't know it would be this good. WOW! <br /> <br />I was wondering who was going to perform first and then both bands came out and played each others songs together. The lead singers of each group sang the other band's songs. How cool is that?!?! There was so much talent on stage. At times I was literally mesmerized. I can't wait to see this DVD to relive the experience again. <br /> <br />Whoever thought of combining these two groups is a genius!!! Thankfully they decided to capture it on film for everyone to see. <br /> <br />UPDATE <br /> <br />I bought it and it is great!!!  <br /> <br />Dave Morehead <br />(...)
B000A88F22|5.0|Britney and Kevin's Chaotic TV series is a big hit all over the world, it has just recently aired in many countries in Europe and is a definate hit.  Reality shows are even more fake than sitcoms.  Finally we have something that is real.  Britney and Kevin used their personal video cameras to capture their daily lives together.  At the time of taping each other, they didn't know that they would air it, which gives the series the right to be called reality (because it's real and unplanned).  Britney decided to come out with her home videos of her life during her european tour of In The Zone in order to stop some of the rumors, and show the world what is really going on in her life.  This is going to be a great DVD so go out and buy it.
0070511136|5.0|I have read quite a few books by various authors; however, these books were mainly targeted at consumer sales. <br />B2B selling is totally different and Neil Rackham reveals that...
B000002UA9|5.0|It irritates me to see people say things like \\"The vocals are shakey,\\" \\"it's raw\\" and \\"It wasn't about musical talent\\" and stuff like that.  All the notes are perfectly fine, the timing is perfect, the chords are played perfectly, everything is in key.  It's all close to perfect, as it would be with any real musician.  Vocals are 100% on now because of auto tuners.  Anyway <br /> <br />Two notes in Anna sound a little weird because the song is in D, and the notes go from E to F#, and neither of those notes are within the G chord which is being played behind it.  This is still correct, though. <br /> <br />Anyhow, this album is great.  Their earlier songs are the best to me, because it was more about the sound of the music other than the 'message' they were trying to send out.  And after all, people originally listen to music because of how it sounds, not what it says, right?  I've never seen a four year old contemplating deeply on the lyrics of a Radiohead song.  So if you like music for music and not just for \\"messages\\" then this is for you.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Anyone who has browses music stores will notice that the film score to \\"The Good, Bad, and the Ugly\\", a film from the 60s, is still selling today.  For anyone who hasn't heard it, the \\"G, B, & U\\" film score is a very complex score that contains many different beautiful themes. <br /> <br />This soundtrack is complex in the same way.  To me it seemed like a bad idea to have two composers collaborate on a score for a blockbuster film but the end result is a score with a 8-10 beautiful and moving themes rather than 1 or 2. I did not really appreciate the depth of this score until I heard it at least a dozen times.  It now ranks among my 3 or 4 favorite scores of all time. <br /> <br />Most great scores are not recognized in their time and this one will probably not receive its due in the form of Oscar recognition.  I do think people will be listening to this score 40 years from now.   <br /> <br />The comparison to the Danny Elfman score is silly.  That was a fun and appealing score but this is pretty serious music appropriate to a more serious movie. <br /> <br />My favorite passages are the last 2 minutes of #2 Eptesicus (beautiful), the last two minutes of #6 Tadarida (sad and beautiful), the first 2 minutes of #7 Macrotus (again beautiful), the first 2 minutes of #8 Antrozous (very stirring), and all of #10 Molussus (again very stirring). <br /> <br />If you are familiar with Hans Zimmer's music you can probably guess which themes are his and which are James Newton Howard's.  Both contributions are equally wonderful. <br /> <br />
B00000JGHS|1.0|I was expecting an intelligent look at the underworld of seedy dance joints and corrupt businessmen.  What I got was a story line that a fifth grader could follow and characters with about as much depth as a stump of wood.  Disappointing film.  This is so dumbed down, even people who like superficial Hollywood stuff will be let down.    <br /> <br />That's just how I feel, sorry Demi, this one is a joke.  Try again.
B000001AI7|5.0|Michael Jackson will remain one of the top artists of all time, no matter what. This album is proof. Little Michael soars like a dove on each and every song here. Was he really a little 13 year old kid here? Yes he was, and with those notes he hits, it's hard to believe. He sings like it's nobody's business on AIN'T NO SUNSHINE, comes through with so much emotion on I WANNA BE WHERE YOU ARE, as well as does nice covers of Supremes and James Taylor. But the title track is the winner. Michael's emoting and the lovely music make for one of the best tracks of all time. Hard-to-find CD is worth the purchase, but if all you can get is a vinyl copy, that is better than being without this.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|Footloose is viewed with immense affection both by those who remember its original release and new fans alike. It actually deserves that high regard. On the surface, it would be easy to dismiss Footloose as \\"just another teen movie\\": Chicago teen Ren MacCormack (Kevin Bacon in his starmaker role) relocates to small-town Bomont (actually filmed in Provo, Utah). There he finds himself in conflict against a town ordnance forbidding public dancing, primarily in the person of Bomont's Baptist minister (John Lithgow). In the process, Ren romances the minister's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer), engages in a Rebel Without a Cause game of chicken with tractors instead of hotrods, and orchestrates the first high school dance Bomont's seen in years, along the way taking part in some pretty freakin' incredible dance numbers. <br /> <br />Not exactly Citizen Kane material, but elevating Footloose above what it might have been is (a) Dean Pitchford's script never condescends to the characters, (b) all the main characters are portrayed by talented actors investing them with believability and dignity, and (c) wonderful choreography. <br /> <br />Footloose came out just after MTV started up, and it was the right film at the right time, a very early instance of the symbiotic relationship between MTV and movies. To promote Footloose, use of MTV was key. Well before its theatrical release, songs from the soundtrack, the two biggies being Kenny Loggins' \\"Footloose\\" (of course) and Deniece Williams' \\"Let's Hear It For the Boy\\" were cut as videos for MTV. This was one of the first times anyone ever used the idea of a soundtrack, and THE first time they used MTV videos of music from same, to really push a movie into being a major hit. It worked like gangbusters. The soundtrack put six songs into the Top Forty. By the time Footloose hit theaters there was already a nationwide awareness of it, of its music and dance scenes. Immense numbers of people wanted to see the film, and were already disposed to like it, because they loved the soundtrack and videos. <br /> <br />20-plus years later, Kevin Bacon's portrayal of Ren MacCormack is still the role with which he's most identified. Strangely enough, Paramount did not want him in the part. At this point in his career, Bacon was regarded as a character actor, best-known for playing Fenwick in Diner, a very quirky, unhappy young man. So the studio's view of Kevin Bacon was, \\"Yeah, great actor, but for supporting character roles, not possessed of the charisma of a leading man.\\" (Boy, were they wrong.) Veteran director Herbert Ross was already attached to the project, and he believed in Kevin Bacon. That carried weight because Ross was very well-established, had already directed many, many actors to Academy Award winning performances, and said, \\"If Kevin Bacon doesn't get this role I'm walking off the film.\\" Given how things turned out, Ross had to feel incredibly vindicated when Footloose was a smash hit, and because of it Kevin Bacon became a star. <br /> <br />As good as Kevin is as Ren, I have to single out John Lithgow as the Reverend Shaw Moore, Ariel's father and head of the anti-dancing fraternity, for special mention. It would have been so easy for the writer and director, and Lithgow, to portray Moore as the villain of the piece, a caricature, a stereotype, the narrow-minded, Bible thumbing, overbearing Baptist minister. Instead he's really the beating heart of the movie, a kind, decent man whose son died in a car crash several years before, and as a result he's become extremely protective and over-controlling of his daughter's life. This is something people can understand as a very human reaction, motivated by love even if it expresses itself badly. Lithgow's portrayal of Rev. Moore and the story of his troubled relationship with his daughter gave Footloose its crossover appeal, turning it from \\"just another teen movie\\" into something adults could watch and enjoy, as well. <br /> <br />Diane Wiest isexcellent in the small but crucial role of Vi Moore, the Reverend's wife. Chris Penn is just amazingly good as Ren's new friend, Willard Hewitt. Some of the most indelible imagery in Footloose, what comes to mind first whenever I think of it, are the scenes where sophisticated, worldly-wise Ren takes awkward, small town Willand and teaches him to dance. Lori Singer is great as Ariel, the wild child who's sexy, angry, and sweet by turns. Really there are no slackers in this movie, every major role is filled by actors who totally inhabit their characters. <br /> <br />Not to put more weight on this piece of mass market entertainment than perhaps it can support, but at its heart Footloose does ask the question \\"What is moral behavior?\\" Is it unswerving adherence to a preset code of conduct, or do we have a moral responsibility to judge the status quo, and if our sense of morality says we must, rise up against it? Footloose is about people, in a small way, on a grass roots, real world level, fighting against oppression, a sort of spiritual/intellectual lockstep mentality. <br /> <br />So that's Footloose. A film that, once you start digging into it, is really one hell of a lot more than \\"just another teen movie.\\" But in the course of doing all that impressive stuff, it never forgets how to entertain and have fun. The DVD has superb extras, including the original trailer; commentary tracks by Kevin Bacon, producer Craig Zadan and writer Dean Pitchford; and three \\"making of\\" featurettes. I would have liked to see the videos for \\"Footloose\\" and \\"Let's Hear It For the Boy\\" and the Kevin Bacon audition tape \\"cut like a rock video\\" mentioned in one of the featurettes (assuming it still exists) included as extras. Oh well, maybe in a future special edition. For now, Footloose is definitely a movie worth owning on DVD.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Coldplay sucks. That out of the way, the singer is a dweeb and he is so full of himself it's sickening. He rivals Billy \\"Pumpkinhead\\" Corgan when it comes to the dork factor. I read about them being \\"influenced\\" by Kraftwerk on the track \\"Talk\\". Influenced? When a song's main melody is used outright, like it is here, it is not being \\"influenced\\" by; it is \\"ripping off\\". How can a band that produces such unoriginal crud be so popular? I think it has a lot to do with hype. They're supposed to be the next big thing. Big deal. Who cares. And if this band is so hot, why can't they buy some decent clothes? I can't stand bands that have no sense of style or pride in their stage appearance. But the bottom line is the music sucks. Buy something else.
B00000293E|5.0|Willie Dixon owns the blues legacy as we know it. He and Robert Johnson are two names that are the most known to non-blues music lovers due to enormous influence they had on many musicians from variety of styles. Now there have been enough reviews describing his lack of vocal talents. Yes I know he's not the Howlin' Wolf, Robert Plant, you name it!!! But the man got the blues feel that bursts out of him singing every word. This album for me carries that blues feel starting from the cover art and on to the beautiful music. If you like blues - get it.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Having had the good luck (perhaps it was angelic intervention) to miss this grotesque spectacle of half-baked nonsense and pretentious gobbledegook when it depressed ticket sales in the theatres a few months ago, I made the mistake of buying the DVD. <br /> <br />Let me just say that I came upon this bloated piece of cinematic feces without any predisposition. I was totally unaware of the graphic novel upon which this Keanu (my middle name is \\"zzzzz\\") Reeves' suicidal vehicle was purportedly based. And even though I had zero knowledge of the director's background, my instinctive impression was that the incompetent creature responsible for birthing this monstrosity was aspiring to excrete a film that would replace a real story, comprehensible dialog and (God willing) actual acting with a tediously relentless mishmash of music video obscurity and a convulsion of inarticulate blather. This godawful train wreck of a concept was authentic in only one thematic sense, I emerged from the mugging feeling like I had spent an eternity in hell.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I was too young to watch Episodes IV and V in the bigscreen, but one of my most vivid childhood memories consisted of watching Episode VI in the theater and being utterly amazed.  I will always remember the Episode VI musical numbers with great nostalgia, for all their corniness and camp.   <br /> <br />Though I understand the frustration that George Lucas must have felt when he couldn't realize his vision completely because of a lack of technology, I still wish that he would have had more consideration for his original fan-base when he released, under great anticipation, the Original StarWars Trilogy.  It was disappointing to  see scenes that were particularly nostalgic for me doctored up or just eliminated.  While I understand that the new version of the films maybe closer to Lucas' original vision for the films and that new fans have been exposed to a wonderful trilogy because of these advancements, it would be nice if Lucas could follow Peter Jackson's approach regarding film versions.  Both versions of each of the LOTR films are available for fans and Lucas should follow suit.  I'm not quite sure why he hasn't adopted this policy, since it would only provide him more money in the long run, as well as pleasing both the old and new fans.   <br /> <br />Until that time, however, when I want a DVD experience, I watch the new version, fast-forwarding through the new scenes that have replaced the ones I dearly missed.  Yes, I miss the lippy muppet lady singing in a strange language that seems an odd mix of Spanish meets Russian.  Being a musician, I think it a more creative and musically more interesting composition than the new musical number. But when I want to relive those special scenes, the scenes that enspire that wry grin that recalls \\"youth\\", \\"silliness\\", and I believe Lucas' ingenuity to make due and create a wonderful story with what he had, I revert back to a set of very old, very worn video tapes.  Thank goodness they still make VCRs.  Don't get me wrong,there are parts of the new version that I think are great; the addition of more creatures being one.   <br /> <br />So, please, new fans, don't think that we old fans are nuts or just not open to change.  Just imagine, in 15-20 years, when there is a new form of video technology and Lucas comes out with a new version of STARWARS, and again changes the movie, and doesn't release the version you grew to love and respect.  Maybe then, you'll understand why we are so disappointed and sad, and why we've reviewed this trilogy so poorly.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is definitely Em's best album. This was probably when he was at the peak of his career. Even for how long ago this came out, if you listen to it now, it still is good. This is when he really cared about rapping, if you were going to get any Em album, get MMLP. Even though Em fell off BADLY, he is still a Top 25 MC based on skills alone, dude is a better rapper than half of the people out now. His multis are crazy when he rhymes, but you have to hear it for yourself.
B000002LRX|5.0|This is the album where Faith no More reached its full potential. The writing is amazing; musically challenging to many genres and lyrically astonishing, brutally vivid and sharp. <br />   This is an historic rock record. One of the first to bring hard core to a mainstream scene that knew nothing about it at the time. The blend of black metal deadence with the catchy powerful roots of FNM. A whole generation was built on copy catting this album. Starting with Korn and going all through that whole list, \\"Angel Dust\\" blew every musician's mind when it hit the street. <br />   \\"Jizzlobber\\" contains one of the coolest, sickest, metal riffs ever. \\"Land of Sunshine\\" is a whole new genre in itself. This work, this album is a new genre all it's own and as much as anyone and everyone may have wanted to it has never been duplicated and rarely met it's equal in originality. <br />   This album stands out as, by far, the best work of FNM but also as one of the best albums of that decade and definately one of the greatest rock records of all time. <br />   Mike Patton has gone on to do great work with Tomahawk and Fantomas. His powerful voice gets full showcase on \\"Angel Dust\\". If you don't like the band but haven't heard this entire record, you owe it to yourself. <br />   This is definately a peice of rock history, a classic. <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|Gosh, I freakin HATE rap music! All of it sucks! And rappers aren't even musicians period! How is talking into a microphone (yes, not singing, but talking) with a bunch of stupid rhyming words with some keyboard in the background doing a loop, playing the same notes over and over again talented? I don't like rap music, my mom and dad don't like rap music, my little brother doesn't like rap music, and my friends don't like rap music (except for the majority of white girls that I know...yes, not only do black people like this stuff but white girls do too, and I know, because I know alot of white girls) The only thing rap music is good for is dancing parties. That's the ONLY thing. Other than that, you can't really buy an album, put it in your stereo, sit down, listen to it, and then call it music, because it just isn't. All rap music is about is wearing corn-rows, wearing do rags, wearing \\"Gangsta\\" style clothing, wearing Nike and Rebok Classic s**tty shoes, wearing \\"bling bling\\" and talking trash about other rappers/musicians/people on your interviews, on MTV, ect, ect, talking trash and constantly cursing in all of your music, saying the N word in all of your songs, saying incredibly uneducated, uncivilized, stupid phrases like \\"Hey, WAD up, BRO\\" or \\"Hey, look bro, dat be my ni***r right derrrr!\\" in public and trying to look bad ass. Is that really your idea of professional talent or professional, amazing musicianship? If so, then you must have a completely screwed up way of thinking. It's incredibly stupid. Rap is stupid, gangster clothing is stupid, and anything related to that is just stupid. I mean really, you can't practice an instrament to rap music, which is proof that rap isn't really music. Do you ever hear about REAL musicians listening to this stuff or about REAL musicians talking about how they practice their INSTRAMENTS to this stuff, becuase no one does. Or if you do, you'd just be playing the same 3 notes over and over again. This 50 Cents character walks around on TV like he's so cool and he thinks he's the s**t when he's probably just a wimp on the inside trying to make himself look tough just so people automatically give respect. To get true respect you don't talk about yourself extremely high and brag on yourself, or constantly walk around with an \\"I don't give a f**k\\" attitude or walk around with a hardcore expression on your face that says \\"Get the f**k out my face\\" And I know what I'm talking about, because I ran into all sorts of people in real life who act that way. If you have to go around constantly, continuously projecting an \\"I'm badass\\" image for all of your music, on TV, in front of your family, friends, fans, and just everyone else in general, then you aren't a TRUE musician. You're just in it for the image, popularity, fame, and money, but don't give a s**t less about your actual MUSIC. This reminds me of other stupid rappers as well like Lil Bow Wow, and Lil Romeo, they all think they're so cool, and think they're hard. And speaking of Lil Romeo, have you happened to see his show on Nickelodeon? On like every episode he thinks he's tough stuff, and his ego is incredibly way too big. Same with the majority of rappers out there, it's the same crap. Not only that but rappers don't even PLAY an instrument, so how can you look up to them, say they're your role models, wear the same stupid gangster clothing that they do, and then call them \\"musicians\\"? It's really sad, disturbing, and sickening once you think about it. All you have to do is take away a rappers microphone and he can't perform anymore. I guess a microphone is supposed to be considered as a \\"Musical Instrument\\" these days, becuase that's the only thing that rappers need to do concerts with. If you're going to buy a stupid trashy no-talent non-instrament playing album like this then you might as well just literrally throw 15 dollars out your window...and hey, who knows, maybe someone might find that 15 dollars, and use it to buy an albumthat's actually worth your time listening to. Try listening to some good hard heavy metal, like Lamb of God, Necrohpagist, Static-X, System of a Down, As I Lay Dying ect, and you wont be disapointedthat's actually worth your time listening to. Try listening to some good hard heavy metal, like Lamb of God, Necrohpagist, Static-X, System of a Down, As I Lay Dying ect, and you wont be disapointed
6305079811|5.0|everyone sees this film as \\"campy\\", but there are such strong mythical themes and archetypes in this that are genuinely moving.  maybe it's just me.  sure, it's overblown and comic-book, but if you're not a dead cynic and truly believe and hope for righteousness and heroism in the face of Ultimate Catastrophe (wooo! :) this will affect you.  the Princess utters, \\"look, water is leaking from her eyes!\\" at the exact moment you will be getting all misty-eyed...  the sound and vision deluxe.  ah, for the glory days of de Laurentiis!!

B0007Y08IS|5.0|When you combine South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone with a horde of marionettes, what do you get?  Team America: World Police begins with an elite counter terrorism squad recruiting a broadway actor who has a tragic past.  As the film unfolds, Team America comes under fire from protesting Hollywood types, as well as evil dictator Kim Jong Il, who has set in motion a plan to destroy every major city in the world.  Oh yeah, in the middle of all this, the viewer is shown two of these puppets going at it, which is one of the most irreverant and hilarious things you'll ever see.  Offensive to no end, deliberately politically incorrect and tongue in cheek, and one of the funniest films to be released in some time, Team America finds Parker and Stone crafting something other than a seemingly one trick pony animated show.  Deliriously funny, Team America isn't for everyone, but for fans of the South Park creators and absurd comedy, this is something really special and surprisingly smart.
B0009MDPYM|2.0|The trailer for CONSTANTINE made it looking vaguely intriguing: majestic wingspan lifting above Gabriel's head, murky derring-do in the streets of Los Angeles, the presence of Tilda Swinton (always involved - until now - in interesting dramatic films), Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and yes, Keanu Reeves.  So what happened?<br /><br />Director Francis Lawrence should stick to his prior experience with making music videos.  After the first few minutes of this tired and monotonous script (deliver in tired monotonous bland monotone by Reeves) you know you should just switch it off.  But then come monsters emerging from the neck of a young girl undergoing exorcism, silly discovery of  a lost spear by a border-crossing Mexican peasant in front of whom all animal life dies, suicides, 'up pops a new monster' episodes etc etc.  The apparent struggle between good and evil forces seems it may have been the impetus for this overblown mess, but others have done it better - many, many, many times ad infinitum.  When will the public's tolerance  (? demand) for this genre be exhausted?  Grady Harp, July 05
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Before I get into the review I just would like to state: <br />1)everything I write should not be taken in as fact. It is merley opinion. <br />2)everyone is different. Don't get mad at people for things they cannot control (eg opinion) <br />and...oh yeah I am in 7th grade. <br /> <br />REVIEW: <br /> <br />Dude this movie is so cool!!! I know so many people that hate it which is very understandable. It's a very unlikeable movie, but...GOSH! I love it. I mean, I was watching it with my realitives my aunt thought I was funnier whislt laughing at the movie and my grandpa QUOTE: Where the hell is the damn plot!END QUOTE. But, man...the part where he throws the steak....OHHAHAHA! Where he tosses the action figure out the window! What the hell!? Oh it was awesome. The acting is so great, and the movie gives you a kind of natural high just watching it. It just...ah it makes me feel good inside. This movie shows that we all have a little geek inside of us and it put out a good message too: <br /> <br />All people are different. You don't have to like everybody. But the people you don't like (say, someone like napoleon?) you dont need to give them a hard time about it, just accept people for who they are. <br /> <br />And if you sat after the credits you get to see a little extra scene which, oh my god, is SO FUNNY!!! hahaha <br /> <br />oh yeah, and one more thing: <br /> <br /> <br />VOTE FOR PEDRO!

B000000W5N|5.0|Anyone that does not own this album, especially those calling themselves rock fans, as I'm sure every Stones fan already has it, must purchase it immediately. Though they are among five favorite bands (probably no. 1 the other 4 being Roxy Music, the Clash, Velvet Underground, and the Who) the purpose of this review is to honestly promote this album, not to lavish undeserved praise on it. Sticky Fingers produced several hits and nearly every song is a classic. The three guitar line-up of Richards, Taylor, and Ry Cooder makes for some of the best fretwork ever to appear on a mainstream album. The song writing is top-notch, the performances are untouchable, and the whole album is yet further proof that the Stones were the greatest band to ever rock the world.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|I've noticed that the runtime for this region 1 DVD is 115 minutes whereas other sites list the original region 3 DVD runtime at 120 minutes.  Was there any censorship involved in the release of the region 1 DVD?  I can't imagine a second being excluded from the movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|I really never heard any album that can be compared to Pink Floyds Dark Side of The Moon, along with this, Ten is something so interesting and so addictive that you cant skip over any of the songs. Its as tho you would rather amputate your hand than even consider moving it towards the seek button. Eddie Vedder is one of, if not the most talented vocalists and songwriters I can think of. His emotional voice stands out and snatches your ears right off and takes them for a unforgetable ride.Along with the flawless guitar riffs and melodies by Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament and Mike McCready, you just cant listen to Ten one time. You've got to listen to it many times over. Songs like Once, Alive, Evenflow and Jeremy, insantly get your blood flowing and cause you to merge yourself within a jamming and pure @$$ kicking world within your mind. Where as songs like Black, Oceans and Release deeply catch Vedders vocal perfection. Though it sometimes may be hard to comprehend his lyrics, his voice eqaully pays the price of the missunderstood jibberish. It takes time and many times of listening to fully appreciate all aspects of the songs but not taking away from the mighty Ten. In conclusion to a long boring reveiw This album is one of the many reasons why God gave us ears.I would recomend it to anyone, just a perfect addition to any rock lovers music collection.(sorry for any misspells or errors, not tryin to impress anyone.)
B000002JNJ|5.0|It wasn't too long ago that I didn't care for Pantera, that was until Dimebag was shot (why cant he have shot f**ks like Ashlee Simpson?). My friend Vince was very upset, and he started playing his Pantera CD 'Cowboys From Hell' and I really liked it. Dimebag Darrell was Dave Mustaine part II, and he had SHREDDING solos! Pantera are not quite heavy enough to be thrash, but they're heavier than your average metal band, so I guess their in between. The songs I liked were the title track and 'Cemetary Gates', hell I liked ALL the songs! I haven't heard 'Vulgar Display of Power' yet, so I have no idea if this is truly their best, but I CAN tell you this, its one of the ninties classics! <br /> <br />RIP Dimebag Darrell... <br /> <br />...they say only the good die young...
B0002IVN9W|4.0|If the appeal of the Arcade Fire's music could be expressed in a simple mathematical equation, it would probably go something like: Emotional directness + musical intricacy=goodness.  With the emotive wailing of Win Butler backed by the eclectic sounds of a decidedly diverse collective of musicians, their debut full-length Funeral is an unconventional, unpredictable, and occasionally thrilling work that actually manages to stake the band some territory of their own in an increasingly glutted indie world.  Even when this album falls short of the high standards set by its best moments, its missteps are still marked by ambition rather than laziness, so they're easy to forgive.  Huge melodies, swells of orchestration, and female vocals abound, and while I don't doubt that such a sound could easily be mangled in lesser hands, the Arcade Fire's undeniable sincerity and detailed songwriting style manage to carry them through any potentially lame spots.  In their better moments, they pull off stuff that previously only the Shins and the Flaming Lips could get away with.<br /><br />The Arcade Fire are considerably more original than such retro-cool hipster acts as Interpol and Franz Ferdindand (to say nothing of the laughably derivative likes of Jet), and their sound has a musicality that seems to be lacking in much of indie music these days.  Even when similarities to other bands pop up (the oft-mentioned Pixies, the Smiths, and the Dismemberment Plan come to mind), these guys have a knack for only taking the best aspects of their influences to form their own genre-bending creation.  Perhaps more importantly, while there are tons of orchestral elements incorporated throughout, this is still very much a rock album.  True, some songs are softer than others, and things can occasionally get a bit overwrought for this reviewer's tastes, but their frequent dense arrangements and puunchy rhythms ensure that the Arcade Fire never quite veer into the unbearably wimpy territory occupied by such sexually ambiguous sissy bands as Belle and Sebastian and Death Cab for Cutie.  This fact is evident right away on the hard-charging opener Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels), and it's only made more apparent on the subsequent Neighborhood #2 (Laika) and Neighborhood #3 (Power Out), which even had me bobbing my head to the sound of a xylophone.  No small achievement, that.<br /><br />In the end, the Arcade Fire's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is a rousing success, making for one of the most accomplished albums of 2004 and a debut that puts them right up there with the Shins and Modest Mouse among the indie world's leading lights.  With the tragic news that the much-revered (by me, anyway) McLusky recently disbanded, I've been looking for a new rock band to worhsip, and while these guys don't quite fit the bill yet they could be well on their way.  Even if you're highly skeptical of indie-world darlings, you owe it to yourself to give these guys a shot and at least come to your own decision.

B000002H6C|5.0|This is Metallicas best album (in my opinion). This and 'Kill 'em All' (Metallica's other 5 star) own 'Master' and 'Ride'. Every musician is top knotch here, even Kirk Hammett starts showing some originality, finally. On every album before this (besides kill) Kirk was very generic and made crappy solos, but now he is very good, and he's even good on the Black Album too. James Hetfields lyrics have never been better, his songwriting is also great and he has the growl of a bear caught in a trap. Lars' drumming peaks here, especially on 'Dyers Eve', even though the production isn't too great. The loss of the great Cliff Burton was horrible, but Jason Newsted tries very hard to sound like him (he wasn't accepted too well in Metallica in the beginning), and we even have another Burton instrumental ('To Live Is To Die')! The production is the only weak point, but that doesn't keep this album from being one of my all-time favorites. Okay, song rating time: <br /> <br />Blackened - I really like the intro here, it actually sounds like the apocolypse' end, and thats exactly what the song's about. Kirk Hammett finally does some great work here, I really like the riff and the solo, the bridge is also good. Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />...And Justice For All - Song that attacks greedy politics (about time!). This is a whopping ten minutes long! For some reason though, I never get bored of this one, and the intro is AMAZING! The solo is also good, I really like the songwriting here. Overall: 11/10 <br /> <br />Eye of the Beholder: Creative riff and great lyrics by Hetfield. The verses have great songwriting by Hammett and so does the intro, but the solo wasn't that great. Overall: 9/10 <br /> <br />One: What can I say? This is THE best Metallica song EVER! This has a great intro, great lyrics, great growl, great drumming, great final solo, probably great bass, this is what Fade to Black and Welcome Home dreamt of being. Kirk was amazing in this song, hell, so was everyone else. Overall: 12/10 <br /> <br />The Shortest Straw: This is a very catchy song, especially catchy guitar riff. The lyrics were also pretty good, but I didn't like the intro too much...Overall: 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Harvestor of Sorrow: This song is great throughout the entire thing. The solo is good, and the lyrics are wierd. Sometimes you may not know what Hetfield is singing about. But that adds to the eeriness of this. Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity: Song about going insane, it even has the Wizard of Oz theme in the beginning (oh-ee-oh...oh-ho). The solo is very good and goes through several scales, which I find to be very craetive. The songwriting is very good here. Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />To Live Is To Die: Burtons finale, and truly one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard. The bass provided the great guitar work in the beginning, and the catchiness once the drums came in. The solos weren't too good, but the rest was great. Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />Dyers Eve: This is the song where Lars stands out a lot. His drumming is PHENOMENAL! The guitar solo is also very good, and the lyrics a bit different from this albums theme. The lyrics are about Hetfields parents and how they always sheltered him, and his growl here is INSANE! Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />...And Justice For All: 91.5/90 - 2nd best album EVER! <br /> <br />You MUST have this if you like metal, because this is the best Metallica album EVER! Kirk Hammett becomes a real guitarist here unlike previous albums. Just get this!

B0002TT0NM|1.0|Compared to the first two Harry Potter films, the third was a very poor comparison to the book.  A great many of the important details were left out of the movie, especially at the beginning, that are essential to set the stage for the plot.  This movie completely fails to capturing the magical mystical charm of Hogwarts; Dumbledore's demeanor doesn't project the same patriarchal figure as usual, Malfoy's appearance isn't quite as wicked, and the students are often seen out of their regular school uniforms which detracts from the strict boarding school atmosphere that the book portrays.  I certainly hope that future Harry Potter movies will reflect the same quality as the books  -- otherwise they should stop making the movies.<br /><br />Very disappointing!!!

B0009ML238|5.0|I haven't been able to stop listening to this album. It really bothers me when people try to bring albums down because they \\"sound\\" like someone else. Sure, they have some Dream Theatre elements, but what prog band doesn't? I say they have more 70's prog rock influence, and I find them more similar to Symphony X/Fates Warning/Ayreon than Dream Theatre. Any fan of prog will enjoy this album.
B0009W5JR8|5.0|Ok, the story line was a bit weak, granted.  But, even if the movie was a total disaster, I would still get it for Peter Strauss alone.  The younger crowd will obviously be enthralled with Ice Cube and company, which is fine, I liked Ice Cube's performance.  But, for us in the older crowd we get the treat of Emmy winner Peter Strauss.  To me, Strauss is by far, the best actor to come along.  But I'm not biased! For those in my demographic, could we ever forget Rich Man, Poor Man, Jericho Mile, Kane and Abel and so much more?  Strauss is a seasoned veteran of the small screen.  But, it was great to see him on the big screen.  I'll get the DVD for his acting alone.  Plus, sidebar note, Willem Dafoe is fantastic in his own right.  I guess the movie was balanced with the hip hop group and the guys who played it on the level. <br />My biggest complaint is that they killed off Vin Diesel.  I don't understand a guy who was so brilliant got axed so easily so they could make room for a new triple-x.  Wouldn't be better to have him in a witness protection program to live out his days and just bring on new triple-x's as needed?  However, along with Strauss and Dafoe, this movie is still entertaining.  The director stretches the story line a bit, but it's a movie after all!  Still, it's worth the price of admission and the purchase of the DVD.
0375507256|4.0|David Mitchell is a really smart writer.  Cloud Atlas is his third novel (I believe) and extremely well written.  I judge books based on writing, characters, and then plot; this book exceeding my expectations in all three sections.  Because he offers such a variety - all sections cannot honestly please everyone.  For me, the first and third plots didn't hit it; but I read them in amazement, not believing that the same man could drastically morph his style so seemlessly.  And where two didn't quite please me, the other four AMAZED me.  I really like this author.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book if you want to think.  It's not a mystery, not that kind of thinking; but most of it is not \\"easy reading\\"...it's smart reading.  The first section is really difficult - you don't need to understand everything.  It probably will not draw you in, but get past the first 10 pages and you'll be used to this section's style.  And after that, you'll be sucked into it all.  Enjoy.
0446677450|1.0|As I started to read this book I was interested in what this man had to say.  Upon completing the book I learned that I should have started investing 10 years ago when the market went kaput.  He was lucky to start off at that time when the market went down, and then picked up soon after, so all of his 'assets' were worth 200% more than what he got it for.  I knew about it then but I was only in high school and as a high schooler I didn't have 20k to invest.  But if I did, I would be filthy rich as well.  And I definitely agree about the comment made in an above entry that he downgrades his real dad in the entire book.  Who gave you food and clothes Robert?  Think about that!  Ok well that is ny two cents...
0767812166|5.0|This movie has the distinction of being the only John Carpenter film to earn an Oscar nomination.  STARMAN is a wonderfully enjoyable movie with Jeff Bridges garnering a Best Actor nomination for his role as the starman, who gets stranded on earth and takes on the form of a young woman's dead husband.  Karen Allen, in her best role, is the widow and she is a perfect match for Bridges' genial alien.  Bridges is a delight to watch as he takes on the mannerisms of a human being; his naivete, innocence and pure goodness radiates the film.  Allen's conflict in how she feels about this alien is also beautifully played out, and by the time the movie comes to its inevitable conclusion, we've been given a rather unique love story to boot.  Charles Martin Smith is good as the government employee who has to battle the war mongering Richard Jaeckel to ensure Bridges' safety.  Bridges scene with the killed deer is also touching.  The movie is like a grown up version of ET, and while it wasn't nearly as successful, STARMAN is one of John Carpenter's finest films.
0393035158|3.0|The premise of Dr. Harris's book seems to be that civilization can no longer survive with religious faith as a part of its makeup. Why? Harris believes that in an age of nuclear proliferation, some religious zealot will get his or her hands on an atomic weapon and destroy the world in the name of God. He makes the case that because of irreconcilable differences, people of different faiths are incapable of living peacably together. Too much is at stake (the soul) and too many of these people are willing to die or kill for what they believe in. Therefore, humanity must abandon religious faith as an acceptable path to spiritual fulfillment and enlightenment.<br /><br />I find Harris's arguments flawed. I happen to be a Christian. One of my neighbors is a devout Muslim. We live together peacably. I may not belive that his faith is the true spiritual path and I am quite certain that he feels the same about me. But neither of us has any desire to kill the other. Anicdotal evidence perhaps, but it does make a point. Harris is using a \\"blame the gun\\" argument here. People who kill in the name of God use religion as a justification for their barbaric and diviant behavior. Take away religion, and these twisted individuals will simply find another excuse to act out in a similar manner. Others have used warped political ideologies, and twisted scientific theories to justify the killing of their fellow human beings. Should we dispense with politics because some crazed facist might decide to start World War III out of a megalomanic desire to rule the globe? Should we ban scientific pursuits out of a fear that some environmentalist nut might launch a crackpot scheme to rid the earth of \\"parasitic\\" humans? I think not.<br /><br />What does Harris offer as a solution to this problem? He believes that through the application of reason, we can solve our differences and save ourselves from distruction. Anything, which prevents an \\"open\\" expression of opposing views, should be considered unacceptable. Yet, Harris's view is that any beliefs that conflict with his Humanistic ideology should be maginalized, if not erradicated. Therefore, everyone must embrace Humanism first. How he would accomplish this, I don't know. On a recent Book TV program, Harris claimed that he is not advocating the forced extermination of persons of faith, and I believed his sincerity. But people are not going to reliquish deeply held religious beliefs just because someone claims it mould be better for everyone if they did so. The only way to bring about this atheistic utopia would be through coercion, a policy that has been followed by such peace-loving nations as China, Iran, and North Korea, just to name a few. Let me point out that it has not worked in those countries anymore than it did in the former Soviet Union. Certainly, were we to outlaw religion tomorrow, very few of the men and women who appeared in church last Sunday would be seen there this week. Fear of persecution would dissuade most from attending, but surely, not all would allow their fear to dictate either their behavior or beliefs. Thousands would remain faithful and retain the courage of their coinvictions in the face of adversity and that courage would attract new converts, as it always does. What would Harris do about them?<br /><br />Harris did admit, on the same program, that he is not a pacifist, so he is leaving the door open (if only ajar) for the use of violence. Harris also stated that there was nothing anyone could say to Osama Bin Laden to change his mind about Islam, implying that the only way to deal with such a person was to kill him. I agree that Bin Laden should be eliminated, and the sooner the better, but because he is a homicidal maniac bent on massacring innocents, not because he refuses to renounce Islam.<br /><br />Finally, Harris demands that we apply evidence to our beliefs and abandon them, should they be disproved. In that spirit, let me subject Harris's own argument to that same standard. Admittedly, I cannot prove the existance of God. However, Harris and his humanistic friends cannot disprove that existance either. Likewise, Harris believes that because mankind is a being capable of reason, he is worthy of trust. However, I can point to a multitude of examples throughout the length and breadth of human history, which demonstrates that mankind has never been trustworthy. No thank you, Dr. Harris. Let's say you are correct about God being nothing more than a product of the imagination. Well, if I die trusting in an \\"imaginary\\" God to save an immortal soul, which I do not possess, I lose nothing. However, should I trust my life to the goodwill of my fellow man, and I am betrayed, (a demostrably likely event) than I just might lose the only existance that I will ever have.that same standard.

0811729117|4.0|A good book but most reveiwers have said that.  What is amazing about the book is that the Auther is still alive and kicking. There is a picture of him with his head just sticking out of the commanders hatch of a tiger tank,  When the British tank museum restored their Tiger to running order, They invited the auther over and he was photographed in exactly the same position in the hatch, 60 years later.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and its arrival on DVD has had me excited for months!  The DVD version is awesome with 6 minutes of extra footage and some nice features including commentary and a \\"Making of\\" featurette.  The video quality is good and the audio is great, with the scenes with music obviously having some updating because the singing sounds more powerful than in the video version.  Some mentioned that the synching seemed off, but I did not notice that on my version.  The extra footage is great too.  I just love this movie and have probably watched it 30 times or more.  I can almost quote it line for line, yet it still never fails to make me laugh like crazy and sing along with the music.  About the only thing I wish is that there was a scene with Allison kicking Lenora's psycho (...).  LOL.<br /><br />One correction to a previous reviewer.  NOTHING has been cut from this version at all.  Its obvious that reviewer has only seen the TV version  and not the true movie version, because the scene she mentions is only shown on TV and never appeared in the VHS version (which I have watched at least 30 times).  While the extra footage does include some of the stuff that gets added on the broadcast version, it is NOT the broadcast version and does not include all of them (which is probably good because some of those broadcast scenes were silly and the sing off one felt out of place when I watched the movie on TV).  The extra scenes that have been added actually help clarify some things (especially  Grandmother Baldwin's seeming overnight reversal of opinion on Cry-Baby) and further highlight some of the social issues/customs back then (like air raids, discouragement for \\"good\\" kids to hang out with blacks, rock music = bad people, etc).<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this DVD version.  If you already have the VHS version, give it to a friend and convert them to the Cry-Baby fandum. :-D  And don't forget the soundtrack so you can sing along in the car!
B00005JNSK|5.0|Quite simply, this film is as great as the original.  They go hand in hand.  What the original lacks, this one has, and vice versa.  Wilder's Wonka was sarcastic and witty.  While Depp's Wonka is sophisticated, childish and twisted.      I disagree with some of the critics that said that Depp's Wonka resembles Michael Jackson.  Not even! One must watch the film to appreciate Depp's eccentric character.  I can think of no better man for the job than Mr. Depp himself.  After all, Burton seems to be drawn to him and they complement each other as well as Danny's compositions do to Burton's masterpieces.  Some parts of the film worked better than in the original and vice versa.  I simply can't separate one from the other; this film completes the story.  I do feel however that some of the kids roles cannot compete with the others.  For instance, Veruca's character is unforgettable in the original as well as Violet's.  Mike Teevee's character comes off much more stronger in this film.  His personality reflects the reality of what most kid's are like today.  Charlie is very sweet but able to put his foot down on things when needed.  Some of the characters just exist, while others transcend.  I loved the background info, and the ending is beautiful.  One finally gets to see where the oompa loompa's come from, (there's finally meaning to their name).  There is alot of background history on Wonka which is great, helps to understand the character more.  His grand introduction IS grand.  On par with the original's.  Weird and funny, it's an adorable, fun, heartwarming ride.  I recommend it! but the rest is up to the viewer. ;)
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is one of the best dvd's I ever purchased. Having been an Eagles fan for many years now and saw them live about 10 years ago I think they are improving with age! It is a pity Don Felder is not still with the band on this dvd but nevertheless the replacement guy is almost as good.The stage and the whole atmosphere is suberb. <br />If anyone out there is making a purchase I would recommend that you watch this concert is full 5:1 surround to get the full value from this production.I have watched it a couple of times already and intend to watch it many more times.
0156027321|5.0|Reading a back page of Life of Pi, I found myself saying, \\"A boy with a tiger on the boat in the middle of the ocean? Ridiculous. That would never happen.\\" Life of Pi proved me wrong.<br /><br />Still not quite sure whether the story was based on the true events, though the author certainly presented it so. If it is true, my hat is off both to the survivor of getting lost and having only a tiger for the companion, and to the author who was able to transform this experience into a hugely entertaining book.<br /><br />Rarely do we see the characters so engaging in any work of fiction. Pi, in his unobtrusive way, starts out the story by whispering to us of animal behavior and his childhood adventures, of his desire to love God in all religions and of his secular Indian family. Only gradually do we find ourselves thoroughly invested in his survival, at the point where it is in most peril.<br /><br />And the tiger!!! Oh, the tiger is magnificent. Pi speaks of him with a mixture of love and anger, which only comes from living with a thoroughly dangerous beast who is also your only companion.<br /><br />One thing that points me more toward - maybe this did happen after all? - it's hard to come up with all the realistic details regarding surviving alone in the middle of the ocean, such as skin problems related to being surrounded by the salty water and being constantly under the sun. It's also hard to figure out a good way to kill turtles when you don't have that many useful tools at your disposal. You kind of have to have been there to learn all those rules to live by.<br /><br />Throughout, the book is founded in the science of biology and thorough knowledge of religions. And although the book begins with, \\"I'll tell you a story that will make you believe in God,\\" it did something better for me: it made me believe even more in the power of man to overcome anything.

B00005JL78|4.0|Before filming began, Steven Spielberg created a \\"think tank\\" of scientists, physicists etc to basically brainstorm what would the future be like, from transportation to home movies to advertising. It's an eerily real picture, as if someone went into the future and came back and told everyone what he saw. So we have Spielberg's first action blockbuster since the Lost World and it's not in the same category as E.T or Jaws but it's still an entertaining romp. <br /> <br />Less than 50 years from now, the Precrime Unit uses the psychic abilities of 3 clairvoyants to determine when someone gets murder so it's up to the police to stop it from happening. But this creates a debate: is someone a murderer if they haven't done it yet? John Anderton believes in its system until he becomes the murderer of someone he's never met. Instead of just getting arrested, he decides to do what they others don't get to do: figure out why he's going to kill him meanwhile being hunted by Precrime's other policemen. <br /> <br />It's a future that seems quite possible. Instead of advertisements on TV, electronic scanners scan your eyes than proceed to advertise their products/services and actually address you. Getting on a train gets you scanned. They even have small Spyders which can also scan rather than policemen doing it themselves. <br /> <br />Transportation systems have electronic cars magnetized(said in the bonus features) and they can travel up and down buildings. Instead of men building cars, it does it all by itself. These and many more are featured in the film and helped along by Spielberg's think tank.  <br /> <br />Now for the film itself. It's merely a good movie. It's not awesome like Jaws, or great like Close Encounters, it's merely good. Close Encounters had a 2 and a half hour pacing but never felt it, here it almost feels it(same length). Also while Jaws freaked you out and scared you and Jurassic Park gripped you, this just merely entertains you. It's like it doesn't getyou pumped about the action scenes, it's like \\"ooh an action scene\\" but you don't get anything afterward. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise can be a good actor if he had the right character. Ever see Magnolia? He's actually surprising in that. Sometimes actors think the best way to act is just to have a big serious face the entire film so it looks like you're deep in thought and troubled. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino can just do one facial expression and they say more than a big overracted speech. Tom Cruise kind of pulls it off, getting better as the film continues. The rest do their job but they merely play static characters, providing a certain type of attitude, so you have the estranged and little bitter wife, the \\"I'm gonna get you\\" government agent and the father-ly runner of Pre-Crime. <br /> <br />If you're thinking of another Spielberg masterpiece think again. But it's close enough and even a near masterpiece is more better watching than the recent fare plaguing movie theatres(I'm looking at you The Pacifier, Monster-in-Law and Shark Boy and Lava Girl)
B00005O3VD|5.0|By the time Barbra made Funny Girl (her movie debut) , she was already a Broadway singing diva. Thankfully, she is forever immortalized on cellioud as Fanny Brice, the funny girl in Funny Girl. With Funny Girl she got to belt out (as only Barbra can belt) multiple show stopping numbers including \\"People\\", \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" and the exhilerating \\"My Man\\". She sang, she acted and she charmed 1968 movie goers who lined up to make Funny Girl a box office smash. Then she won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actress in 1968. WAY to go girl! You deserved all the praise you got for Funny Girl. What a performance! A MUST HAVE DVD for the classic musicals collectors and/or Barbra fans.
B000063UR2|5.0|Legend is one of the best fantasy movies that i have seen in a long time!!!! It has the hottest guy ever Tom Cruise and it also has a wonderful performance by Tim Curry as darkness!!!!!!! Every time that i see this movie it takes me to a magical place with your worries can just sink away!!!!! It has demons, goblins, fairies, great settings, and last but surely not least it has a wonderful score by Tangerine Dream!!!!!! I think that you guys should buy this movie and enjoy it everyday and everytime!!!!!!!!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Very boring horror movie that has Keanu Reeves playing a Sam Spade like occult investigator who helps a police officer in death of her twin sister. The story sounds simple enough but it get convoluted in all the supernatural happening that is going on and the screenplay really does not bother to explain itself in those occurrences.  The special effects are good but some of them are repetitive and some visuals are not that well done. The acting is decent for a movie of this kind with Rachel Weisz proving once again to be one of the most versatile and talented actresses of her generation. Her performance is actually too good for this film because it demands a better showcase than this film. Her character is strong enough to hold this film by herself but with the inconsistent writing that is in the screenplay, she is reduced to carrying Keanu on her shoulders while he is trying to figure out on which film he's in.  Which leads to the film's biggest problem and that is Keanu Reeves himself. He's miscast in the role of John Constantine and a better actor would have been able to show more of his sides than Keanu was able to do. Keanu just comes a cross as a jerk and that would have been alright if he at least showed some humanity but Keanu can't balance that out and he just comes across really bad. A better actor would have done more but with Keanu, you really can't expect much and you don't get anything here. That hurts the creditability that this movie had for the main character and it hurts the way you see the movie as a whole. The direction lacks focus and some scenes don't hold well with the whole film.  <br /> <br />Worth a rental for Rachel Weisz's great performance and some of the special effects but not worth owning. <br />
B00000AOUD|5.0|I dont see how anyone could rate this album lower than five stars. It is my personal favorite Tull album, not to mention my favorite album of all time.
B00005JNSK|4.0|First, let me warn you. This film is not like the original film. It  has a complete contrast in personality. It has a more updated look to it. It also is a lot stranger and quirky than the original. It is, in no means, a child's movie. It has more adult themes in it.<br /><br />The film is about a revolutionary candy-maker that goes by the name of Willy Wonka(Johnny Depp). After leaving his father and settling off on his own, he starts a candy factory where it settles to make the best candy in the world. After a worker of the factory leaks out a secret formula for a new candy, Wonka fires all of the human workers and places the job of making the candy in the hands of the Oompa Loompas and machines. He then secludes himself into the factory, until one day he sends out five golden tickets in five separate packages of Wonka Bars for five kids to find. They would be able to tour the factory with this ticket. When all of them are suddenly eliminated, leaving one child, Charlie(Freddie Whitmore). Wonka is giving a offer to Charlie to run the factory when he is dead and gone, but Charlie has something that Wonka doesn't, a family.<br /><br />Tim Burton has entirely taken over the story that was written by Ronald Dahl. The style of the film is clearly Burton's. It was quirky, weird, and strange, but strangely funny. Tim Burton's direction really helped make the story feel more realistic and fun. I felt that it was a tad more creative than the original film. Also, it had a modernized look and feel to it. Also, I felt that Burton kept true to the book and made it really feel vibrant and alive. I found some true greatness in what Tim Burton did to make the story overflow on the screen with vibrant colors and wonderful sounds.<br /><br />Johnny Depp as Wonka was perfect. He was weirdly hilarous, and strange too. In my opinon, he gave a much better peformance than Gene Wilder did in the 1976 version. Johnny Depp had the look of the part down. I do not know what he based Wonka on, but the character was very childesh in nature and had some very strange qualities to it(Micheal Jackson, perhaps?). Freddy Highmore was decent as Charlie, he had to work with what he was given and he was good. But, he has had more solid performances with other films and other directors.<br /><br />In my opinon, you need to forget the original and what it was all about when you go into this movie. It was an entirely different film and had some qualities that the original probably didn't. In my opinon, Tim Burton has taken the story and made it his own, filling it with wonder and imagination and weirdness that is signiture Burton. Overall, I had a enjoyable experience at this movie because it was one fun ride through the factory of Willy Wonka.Wonka on, but the character was very childesh in nature and had some very strange qualities to it(Micheal Jackson, perhaps?).

B000002C2E|5.0|This album sees Mr Dylan in a melancholic mood (nothing unusual here)with a strong blues presence permeating the entire album. Wonderful guitar laden melodies. Lyrically strong and wistful tales here.  The whole album just goes on to illustrate that Dylan is still THE man both as a lyricist and musician. All tracks are gems with my personal favourites being Lovesick, Not Dark Yet, Trying to Get to Heaven and Standing in the Doorway. <br /> <br />Dylan fans will no doubt already have this album.  New Dylan listeners should not hesitate in grabbing this one. <br /> <br />Thank you Mr Dylan.
0446677450|1.0|First of all, I wonder how much the rating of this worthless book would change after everyone gets over thier multilevel marketing high.   <br /> <br />The only thing I actually learned from this book was a tax code that allows you not to pay taxes on property you sell, but only when you put that money into other property.   <br /> <br />The other thing I learned, which was useless for myself, was that Robert Kiyosaki has little repsect for his real dad (his \\"poor dad\\").  He continually criticizes is \\"poor dad\\" for working hard and obtaining the highest position in the public school system in Hawaii; although he claims his \\"poor dad\\" retired with nothing, which may be true.   <br /> <br />It's true a college education won't make you rich.  I know plenty of people with only a high school education that have more money than many with, but let's nut underscore the value of an education in general. <br /> <br />I'm sadded I wasted $12 for this book and that so many more have only to realize this guy, along with others who pretend to know more than most others about how to get rich, i.e. Russ Whitney, William Danko, are only out to get your $12.    <br /> <br />To all you other reviewers, when you wake up from you MLM nightmare, write a new review to bring out the true value of this book.
076790592X|2.0|This had to be an Oprah book. <br /> <br />Hey, I thought Brandeis was an elite school - how did Albom get out of there without a lit course?  There is not word in Albom's careful pruning of Morrie's thoughts that is anything new, enlightening, or even surprising.  More importantly, these thoughts have been brilliantly expressed by the greatest in poem and prose for a couple of thousand years.  Albom would do well to stick to 'Jordan was 11 of 17 and perfect from the free throw line.' <br /> <br />There's a little section in the front of the book modestly entitled \\"Lives Changed by 'Tuesdays With Morrie'\\".  In it we learn that people are reading Ablom's work to children and students.  Folks, please . . . . this is a very, very depressing book about death.  All those nifty little Stewart Smally sayings about life are much more nicely presented, and their impact squared, in \\"The Little Prince\\". Plus the kids will go to sleep tonight not worrying about the day when she/he can no longer wipe their own butt (second person butt wiping being a major theme in \\"Tuesdays\\"). <br /> <br />Listen, Morrie faced death courageously and I kind of feel like I'm insulting the guys memory by knocking this book.  But it's not his book; the failure here belongs to Albom alone.  I came away from this book liking Morrie Schwartz, a very different person from me - but I wish I'd known him.  But I also came away disliking Albom.  Among a litany of complaints about the author the one that sticks in my craw concerns the few words Mitch has for Morrie's wife, his only wife, his life partner - versus the importance he heaps on Ted Koppel and Ted's three brief appearances (complete with TV crew) in Morrie's life. <br /> <br />Lastly, you guys out there should be aware that this is a full-throated chick book.  Depressing, disease ridden, finding joy in sorrow, touchy feely, TV movie of the week stuff.  The second I put it down (it is a very short read - Albom writes sports columns remember) I ranout and got me a Larry McMurtry western. <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah definitely had a comeback with this CD. I haven't been an avid Mariah fan in the past. Sure I liked her songs and she has an awesome voice, but it just wasn't my style. I took one listen to this CD and all that changed. This is definietly my style. She brings her own style of music and makes the most balanced CD I have listened to in a long time. It takes a great CD for me not to skip over some tracks. I never skipped once on this CD.  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That 4/5 Amazing start to an incredible CD. Very danceable and listen worthy.  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together 6/5 My all time favorite song on this CD. I'm not usually into the sappy love songs, but this was just so beautifully arranged, it really touched me.  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off 5/5 Another favorite of mine. Catchy with a good beat.  <br /> <br />4. Mine Again 4/5 Mariah's voice soars on this song. It shows what she can really do, and if you've yet to listen to any of her earlier stuff (Where have u been?!) then you should definitely listen to this. <br /> <br />5. Say Something 5/5 Cute song, and I luv the fact that Snoop collaborated with her. They make a good team, I hope to hear more of them together. <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night 4/5 Another showcase of Mariah's talented voice.  <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number 4/5 Future Radio Single I think...That's my guess, it's another cute song, and another great collab. <br /> <br />8. One and Only 4/5 Must I say it again? Great Collab! Twista is a fave of mine so bringing these two together was pure genius! <br /> <br />9. Circles 4/5 Mariah's voice really comes out here, showing real emotion. I'm sure this song has special meaning, I can tell it in her voice.  <br /> <br />10. Your Girl 4/5 Cute song, and worthy of this CD.  <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew 5/5 I wish I wrote this song :) Cuz that's exactly how I feel right now. and If I had a voice like Mariah's to match, that person would definitely know ;) <br /> <br />12. To The Floor 4/5 Nice Collab and a great addition to the CD <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride 4/5 Carefree song and very listenable <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird 4/5 Couldn't ask for a better way to end this CD than this gorgeous song. You must buy the CD, its not joke how incredible it was.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Mr. Lucas had a great thing going for him with the original IV, V & VI. With his claim of the \\"deteroiration\\" of the original film/films, he had to do something which is to make copies....well where are they? <br /> <br />The movie I saw in 1977 and the next two that followed after, are not the same movie/movies that he claims to be the \\"original/s\\". What we now have is something that is created for the young padiwans of today. Mr. Lucas has obviously turned toward the \\"dark side\\" when making the desision to \\"re-do\\" the movies (or it was a massive brain fart). <br /> <br />Those of you who like the \\"newer versions\\" so be it. But beware they are looking more and more like micheal jackson's face if you know what I mean. Pretty soon you won't want to look at it after all the changes. <br /> <br />Those of us that would like to have those movies (that we saw way back when), are not whining but merely requesting to have them on DVD and see them again as they were.  <br /> <br />I still purchased the newer versions and did like them, but was disappointed some what because they were just not the same. I, II & III in my opinion were very good. It's understandable that you wanted IV, V & VI to look more in step with the newer technology movies but....I know this is grotesque but think of micheal jackson....it's the same feeling when I watch the revised versions. <br /> <br />Mr. Lucas, how about putting the \\"real originals\\" out on DVD. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002J1O|5.0|Selling England By the Pound(1973) is Peter Gabriel's best work for Genesis. In fact, eveyone is great on this album; Tony Banks does great with the keys, Steve Hackett has some great electric guitar solos, Mike Rutherford does a great job with the 12-string and cello, and Phil Collins' drumming skillings really shine. The album starts out with DANCING WITH THE MOONLIT KNIGHT. The song starts out sounding like a vintage millitary song and then the guitar comes in and the song picks-up. I KNOW WHAT I LIKE(IN YOUR WARDROBE) is a humourous song about a gardner. FIRTH OR FIFTH  is one of the better songs on the album with the classical piano and flute. MORE FOOL ME is the second song with Phil as the lead singer. This song is a transition between two epics. THE BATTLE OF EPPING FOREST is a twelve minute song based on a true story. The middle part of the song is the best part. AFTER THE ORDEAL is a soulful instrumental that leads into the last epic, THE CINEMA SHOW. This song is about a theatrical play. This song would've been better if it had more lyrics. The last song, AISLE OF PLENTY is hard to describe. Its a bit eerie.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I never was a speed metal fan.....i always liked music like Coldplay, Audioslave, Tool, and Nine Inch Nails.....well my friend introduced me to Waking The Fallen.....i have to say when i first heard it..i thought it sucked but as i listened more i heard intresting elements that made the song stand out such as the intresting guitar riffs or the band members harmonizing vocals when they all sing together its just plain awesome..........anyways with the lead singer lossing his ability to scream we get the new album City OF Evil and in every way this is a step foward for Avenged Sevenfold Musically this is the best thing i have ever heard from them......i like their other stuff but......i like this alot more and this will rank in my collection of cds at possibly the most catchiest cd Out it is just so damn catchy you will find yourself humming to the chorus or playing along with the drums its very addictive....................if you are getting into avenged sevenfold get City Of Evil and then go get Waking The Fallen and Sounding The Seventh Trumpet....all in all Musically City OF Evil doesnt fail to impress and i really don't understand the 3 1/2 star rating but whatever i guess alot of fanboys got dissapointed without the screamo
6305364648|5.0|True Lies is my 2nd favorite Arnold movie after Terminator 2. It's such great fun and has great acting! Arnold, Jamie Lee Curits, Tom Arnold, and Bill Paxton are all excellent. The movie has SO MANY memorable action scenes but also has loads of great laughs. The movie is about a spy played by Arnold whose wife thinks that he's a computer salesman. Arnold fights lots of bad guys and even rides on a horse! It's nonstop fun with great action and great laughs. Some of the scenes with Bill Paxton will have you rolling on the floor with laughter.  <br />All I can say is that if you like Arnold movies, this is a definite must own and even if you don't like him but like action movies, this is one of the best ones!
0156027321|4.0|The book is an easy and engaging read. I couldn't wait to finish it in several hours. <br />The story is original, rich in details, well-structured, imaginative, and incredible. <br />The story-line is itself like the ocean, it rises and falls, sometimes placid and sometimes violent. Though it gets gory and a bit boring in the middle, the ending is stunning. <br />It taught me a lot about animals and survival skills, but I don't think it makes one believe in God so easily. <br /> <br />

B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is absoultely amazing. Kanye west gives me a whole new outlook on the rap genre. It is refreshing to hear somebody rap about something other than 'T & A' and alcohol/drug abuse. I especially liked Jesus Walks, this song is one of the more powerful pieces of music i've heard in a very long time.  <br /> <br />Buy this cd, and you will see what rap is SUPPOSED to be. <br /> <br />GO KANYE!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|WARNING! contains possible spoiler...    Attention!! This film will interest those who are curious on the subject matter of time travel, alternate universe's, spiritualism & the possibility of destiny.    The story concentrates around Donnie Darko, a teen living in the 1980's along with his average suburbanite dysfunctional but loving family.  Donnie has been experiencing a mental disturbance, illusions of a bizarre character by the name of Frank, who mesmerizes & instructs him to accomplish set task's which alternate daily routine, along with sharing disturbing information about coming events's of the near future.  Nothing more should be disclosed about this cinematic gem, what i've given you is a thin trivial element of the plot. SO, now it's time to follow your spirit guide, it's urging you to get your stupid man suit down to the video store & rent this \\"trip\\"!...  Wait a minute... that's just one destiny to follow, OR... you could just buy it! It's a worthy addition to any cinemaniac's collection!!!    p.s. the Director's Cut was the one that was meant to be, but check out the original theatrical cut anyway, it rocked my world the first time around & then... the second coming set thing's right... enjoy!!!
B000001EL7|4.0|By 1977 Kiss was the hottest band in the world. 1975's \\"Alive\\" got their career jump started and it's follow-ups \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" made Kiss into superstars. With 1977's \\"Love Gun\\" Kiss delivered another hard rock classic. In my eyes \\"Love Gun\\" is the best Kiss album. It's hard to resist such songs as I Stole Your Love, Christine Sixteen, Plaster Caster, and Love Gun. If you enjoy \\"Destroyer\\" you'd like \\"Love Gun\\" as well.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Constantine is a movie that is suppose to make us a little bit wiser with all the spiritual logic thrown around but its the director who has a twisted logic on sprituality. It seems that the script was supposed to sound smart and supposed to make the audience understand everything that was going on but me and the others who watched this movie grasped nothing. When your pondering about whats going on storywise your hit with special effects or a battle scene or some explosion to detract from the convuluted story.    The Plot-Constantine(Keanu reeves) is a tortured soul who after coming back to life from a suicide attempt when younger who now as an adult slays half-breed angels or demons who try to possess or influence people more than they should, and if they pass this barrier that is made He has to right to kill them.  And in this movie Constantine develops lung cancer and feels he should go to heaven after all the demon killings he's done but is still marked for hell.  (not confusing right? sure)  But wait theres more  There is an ancient sword  that has something to do with satans son being released onto earth which has to something to do with the angel gabriel when has something to do with these two twins which one commits suicide.(I know i lost you, i'm lost too.)    The Action-Now this is where the movie picks up some stars.I have to say this movie does have some very good special effects which we are shown Hell, demons, heaven and very cool demon death scenes.  The Battles scenes between Constantine and demons are very good and C's Arsenal is very deadly from Crucifix shaped shotguns to holy water grenade's to flamethrowers and gold plated knuckles with crucifixes engraved, cool huh?    The Negatives-Well if you haven't noticed---THE STORY!!!!!!  this is one story that is HARD AS HELL-pun intended- to capture and follow and all that you understand is Constantine is just one big shallow complainer.From his rants of \\"I don't want to go to hell, i'm a freakin demon-slayer for christ's sake\\" to \\"my life sucks, i'm better off dead\\" Constantine is just one big crybaby and makes for one of the worst hero's ever caught on cinema.   During the last scenes of the movie i wanted Constantine to die already and just be put out of his misery already because he was making me feel miserable.    In Conclusion-Good special effects, nice action scenes don't make a movie great.Maybe if this movie was released in the 80's this could have passed off as good but it's not.  Confusing story, miserable lead character, weak supporting cast(even though Shia labeouf was a little amusing)and weak ending make Constantine a Weekend Rental but not a buy.    Dvd bonuses include 18 minutes of additional scenes and a alternative ending(Woop-de-frickin-doo)    Pros  +good special effects  +good action scenes    Cons  -Dull acting  -Horrible Hero  -Confusing Story  -weak ending  2.5 stars out of 5-rounded up to 3.    The Opinionated One has Spoken
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot Vol:3(The Subliminal Verses) has all their metal stylings from the first album with some more melodic songs added in.  It sounds like they tried to mix Slipknot and Stone Sour (Corey's first band).  I liked this CD alot, some of the more \\"Hardcore\\" fans out their might not like it, but its deffinatly worth listening to.

B0009MDPYM|2.0|This is a bizare movie. I was raised Catholic and it made no sense on either the theological or fantasy level.  God love ya' Keanu, but damn, find some range bro. Very boring lead acting. Lines like \\"I just got attacted by a demon\\" performed like he was asking the time of day.  <br />Why was everybody whispering? I can't hear you!! I haven't heard this much whipering since \\"The Sixth Sense\\".  <br />I did like this the first time when it was called \\"The Prophecy\\". <br />Enough bagging. It did have awesome FX and the guy who played Lucifer was great!!  <br />This could have been a four star movie, but alas, it was mostly a mind-draining snooze fest. Sorry Keanu. The Matrix 1-3 still rule!  <br />2 1/2 stars to be fair.
B0007P3582|1.0|I feel like the kid in Sixth Sense.  When 50 first came out, I was could see {lame artist}. But no one else saw it.

WRONG. 50's garbage. Always has been, u just couldn't see that. Its funny 2 me though. U might think its immature of me 2 sit here and gloat \\"I toldja so\\" but I don't care. Theres others like me out there. That weren't pluged into the 50 cents Matrix that spread across the land. This review is for THEM. Join me in my joy, in watching these pretentious, wannabe, followers wallow over their dissapointment.
B00005JNSK|3.0|This movie dazzled me quite a bit at the amazing visuals and all the quirky things among Willy Wonka's factory. It's even a really amusing movie to just watch without any sound but it's so wonderful to look at. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp has given several odd performances in his lifetime, such as Jack Sparrow and Edward Scissorhands. But this one tops them all. He looks weird, he talks weird. Everything about his performance is just plain odd. But, I guess that was the point, meaning that he did a good job at it. <br /> <br />One part I was surprised to like were the Oompa Loompa songs. All of them had a really great style, being that they were all so different. They were fun just to dance to. <br /> <br />This is definitely a good movie to go and really enjoy yourself. Don't be afraid to dance around in your seat! I wasn't!!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I'm not quite sure if it's possible to surpass THE GODFATHER series in terms of pure artistic beauty. The imagery is wrought with the emotions of the film and the characters, the Italian-language moments are scripted well and interjected at the best times, and the acting (among other things such as the directing and cinematography) is superb. It's a travesty, it really is, that Al Pacino never won an Oscar for these films. The extras, including commentaries, are very well done and don't ruin the integrity of the film, as so many DVD extras often seem to do. <br />I've loved these films since I was a little girl; even then, I was able to discern the circumstances and fabulousness of the characters. This is due to Francis Ford Coppola's unceasing vision. Although Part III is clearly the least of the trio, it is the necessary conclusion that the series needs. Perhaps if it had been brought to the screen sooner after Part II, the vision would have been less interrupted. However, all three are remarkably well done -- I hate to repeat myself, but nothing surpasses THE GODFATHER.
0440419514|2.0|I started this series, and after reading the first book, The Golden Compass, was certain that the shining reviews were correct, that this indeed was another landmark fantasy series like LOTR.  I excitedly recommended it to friends, and started on The Subtle Knife.  Despite brilliant scenes, it was definately looser than the first, but still very good.  The third book, The Amber Spyglass, however, completely fell apart.  It was such a huge let down in fact, that I feel cheated, which is why I'm giving this series 2 stars. <br />For those of you who haven't read it yet, you'd better stop here. <br />For those of you who have already made your judgement that I'm really just a disgruntled Christian, and that your beloved masterpiece is beyond logical reproach, you can stop here too. <br /> <br />Why didn't I like The Amber Spyglass?  Pullman pulls in so much superfluous crap into the third book that he can't tie together, that it bursts open like a bale of hay.  To deal with this, he changes the nature of characters with senseless glee, leaves gaping inconsistencies and loose ends, and worst of all, he spends two and a half books preparing the reader for a dramatic battle that never occurs.  Why?  Because it seems that as if in the last book, Pullman decides that he hates God so much that he can't even bring himself to make God a formidible enemy, so he quickly disposes of God and his Cosmic Meathead Orderly with a few casual pages, and changes course.  No, these divine enemies are way too pathetic.  Forget that the entire series has been building toward fighting them.  No, Pullman brushes them aside, and makes the TRUE enemy human nature. Selfishness, lust for our own desires, all the things that led to the making and use of the knife, the loss of dust, and the creation of Spectres.  These are the enemy.  But isn't it funny how these same exact \\"values\\" are what cause Lyra to \\"fall\\" thereby saving the universe.  And what did happen there exactly? The consciousness of the universe was so interested in a pair of copulating 12 year olds that it stopped draining into nowhere?  And despite this, it was still necessary to close all the the windows except for 1, not 2 mind you, but 1?  All so we can have the heart rending dollar store tear jerker at the end?  Sorry, the implausible, unexaplainable things that arose in the last book was just too much. <br />While reading the last book, I had no idea where it was going.  I kept waiting for a climax that never came.  I was so excited about the prospect of watching God get an ass-whoopin (as prophesized), I barely realized He died.  It was like a tarp blew out of my truck while I was driving down the highway, and I realized several miles down the road it was gone.  I kept thinking, \\"So is it over?\\"  But it wasn't.  It dragged on with the excitement of hung-over teenagers packing up their campsite after a night a partying in the woods.  And, in a truly astonishing finale, Pullman slaps his devoted readers in the face by taking these two 12 year old children who have saved the universe, whom you have come to love, and who have defied all natural and celestial laws with human ambition, love, and loyalty...All of a sudden they are forced to stand down, accept the authority of...the limitations of the physical universe, be bound to its rules and their own chosen concern for the lives and well-being of others, (is this starting to sound like Christian values here, I'm getting teary eyed) and force themselves apart in a monumental act of self restraint and sacrafice (wasn't it Mary, the serpent, who scoffed at these notions while tempting Lyra? ).   <br />The last book presents a loosely assembled, muddled casserole of conflicting ideas, unbelievable sequences of events, and totally contrived, unneccesary drama.  The deterioration in writing from the first book to the last is remarkable, but by that time, many readers are so infatuated with Pullman's characters and worlds, they simply fail to notice.

B0002IU988|4.0|When I heard that the members of Creed minus Singer Scott Stapp would be forming a band of their own I expected very simply \\"Creed 2\\".  This was easy for how could a band where the core writer and co founder of Creed would be forming this new project.  Mark Tremonti was already ready with this recording just a few months after the announcement of Creed's breakup was announced.  Joining Tremonti (who would be on guitar still) would be Scott Phillips (drums) and Brian Marshall (bass).  Mark and Scott had been in Creed for all three albums while Marshall had left after \\"Human Clay\\".  Joining the three on vocals would be Myles Kennedy formerly of the Mayfield Four.  As I listened to the CD it was immediately apparent that this group would not be an exact copy of Creed and I based this primarily on the difference in vocal register of Kennedy.  While Stapp held a deeper resonance that was often compared to Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Kennedy seems to be able to reach notes that Chris Cornell would pull off with ease.  A lot of the music is Creed-like and I expected this much for ones writing style would usually take some larger amount of time to change into something different.  It is my belief that had Creed remained together that some of these songs would have been on the new album.  The similar musical sound surely can appeal to the existing Creed fans.  The name \\"Alter Bridge\\" is drawn from a personal point in Tremonti's childhood based on paths and choices.<br /><br />The band has had tracks from the album featured on the soundtracks to both \\"Elektra\\" and \\"Fantastic Four\\" and this is sure to assist them in building a larger fan base.  While I enjoyed the CD for the most part especially due to tracks like \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"Shed My Skin\\" I have to wonder if the existing Creed Legions will take to this in the same manner as the predecessor.  The band clearly is solid and the production on the release is nice and heavy at time.  So I hope they don't pass on it merely waiting on Scott's debut as a solo artist.  There are a good enough number of tracks on the CD to merit purchase so I advise them to check it out.  Songs such as \\"Down To My Last\\" can easily find their way on the radio stations as simply as a track like \\"Higher\\" and \\"One Last Breath\\".  I say this as someone who was also skeptical in the beginning and now finds himself playing the CD regularly.rely waiting on Scott's debut as a solo artist.

B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I this movie has people living and working underground in a place call The Hive. It's right under Raccoon city. A T-Virious starts to infect all the employees down their and turn them into zombies. A woman who can't remember anything was caputred by a cop until some guys in uniforms broke in and grabed the cop they took her and the cop down the hive to shut the hole place down, it turns out that they ran into some trouble by kill the zombies if they don't want to get bitten and become one. This first is not so much base on the video game like the second movie is but it is a lot more blooder which I like.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Has 2005 been the return of female R&B? Amerie tempted us to \\"Touch\\" her with a catchy single, Faith Evans stepped out of her late husbands shadow to become a formiddable R&B force, Tweet announced \\"It's Me Again\\" and no one cared, while Keyshia Cole attempted to become the next Mary J. Blige in training. However none of the above mentioned artist had an album that was more anticipated and with higher expecations than Mariah Carey. On her 8th studio album (10th LP overall), 15 years in the game & a plethora of  #1 singles, what more exactly does Mariah have to offer us?  <br /> <br />Let me start of by saying one thing. I'm not a Mariah freak that thinks everything she has ever put out is golden nor am I a Mariah hater that cringes everytime \\"One Sweet Day\\"  or her numerous other #1 singles play on the radio. I have always taken Mariah on a case by case basis. So with that said we review Mariahs latest work \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\". <br /> <br />A lot was riding on \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\". After the disaterous Glitter (which did eventually go  platinum) and the dismal follow-up \\"Charmbracelet\\" Mariah had to rethink her strategy. Carey said \\"Charmbracelet\\" was a result of her record label wanting her to harp on her \\"breakdown\\" and sing her swan song about making it \\"Through The Rain\\". So when Mariah did eventually make it through the rain, it was time for Mimi to be emancipated.  <br /> <br />Fresh off his hot streak with Usher, Jermaine Dupri laced Mimi's catchy first single \\"It's Like That\\". It was a certified club-thumper with catchy clapping, loving life lyrics and a memorable chorus. The song peaked at #12 on the charts. Mariah has always been a decent songwriter and she has written her own material since the inception of her career however one has to wonder why at age 35 she feel's the need to spout lines such as \\"Those chickens are ash and I'm lotion\\", and flaunt her bling like when she talks about picking up her Louis Vuitton on \\"Shake it off\\" or havinga house in Capri on \\"Get your number\\". Perhaps the gem of the album is the other J.D produced hit \\"We Belong Together\\". The Emancipation of Mimi was hailed as \\"The Return of The Voice\\" in ad campaigns and while Mariah says the voice has always been there it's never been more evident than on this track. The song opens with a dramatic piano intro eventually launching Mariah into song about letting her true love go, and the heartache it is causing her. Contrary to popular beliefs that the songbirds vocals have been permanently damged there is no evidence of that here becauseMariah sings in full voice throughout the song however she avoids vocal theatrics laxing her vocals where needed and belting where neccesary. The song became her 16th #1 single and pushed \\"Mimi\\" back to the top of the album charts a month after it's release.  <br /> <br />\\"Shake it off\\" is a nice summer groove. Maybe it isn't the most lyrically innovative track of Mimi's career however if you just want to enjoy a fun song \\"Shake it Off\\" will serve that purpose. On \\"Mine Again\\" Mariah takes the \\"We Belong Together\\" route again talking about hopefully reuniting with a lost love. The instrumentation on the track is brilliant as are Mariah's vocals with better than average \\"I miss you please be with me again\\" lyrics and smooth horn's and piano. The Emancipation of Mimi would not be a Mariah Carey album without hip hop appearnaces which have become a staple of her career since \\"Fantasy\\" her trail-blazing track with the now deceased O.D.B. Before Ashanti had Ja Rule, Mariah was alreadying making Hip-Hop/R&B duets a main stay on pop radio. (Check out Heartbreaker, Honey etc.) \\"Say Somethin\\" is as \\"Neptunes\\" as songs come these days, and if anyone has the \\"Tasty\\" LP by Kelis (yes the milkshake girl) the beat for this song came straight off of that album. Out of all the tracks featuring rappers on this album this one is the catchiest mainly because Snoop and Mariah have always sounded good together and the playful lyrics between the two make for an engaging song. \\"Get Your Number\\" is an attempt at another club-banger a la \\"It's Like That\\" however for me the song just never caught on. Mariah's cooing at the intro set's up the song, however after that the song just cruieses into mediocrity. On \\"One and Only\\" Mariah is looking for that special one after a disasterous relationship. Lyrically it's one of the better tracks on the album with Mariah looking for a man that will \\"Rub her slow and make her sing real high when he goes down low\\". \\"One and Only\\" would actually be a very good track however Twisters appearance kills it for me but if you can look past that for a quality song you'll find one here.  <br /> <br />Much in demand Hip Hop heavyweight Kanye West lends his production talent to one track on the album with the stellar \\"Stay The Night\\". It's a radio friendly track with a mid tempo groove a la Alicia Keys \\"U don't Know My Name\\" and Janets \\"I Want You\\". Mariah talks about being at a friends house that she has always been attracted to. She knows he is involved with someone yet he keeps insisting that she \\"Stay the night\\", although Mariah is hesitant becausedoesn't trust herself or what could happen. Vocally she's better on this track than on \\"We Belong Together\\". <br /> <br />Ballad \\"Circles\\" produced by Jimmy Jam of produciton duo Flyte Tyme (Janet's\\"Control\\") is as vulnerable as Mariah gets on this album. An ex-flame has Mariah a hot mess, not knowing what do do with herself running around in circles and tumbling down. She hits the infamous Carey high note on this song and it fits in surprisingly well. Lyrically it's raw and honest and another notable vocal performance. The following track \\"Your Girl\\" is fun. It's one of the most enjoyable songs of the album and one of the ones that works best with an upward groove and soaring vocals. Throughout the song Mariah assures us that she will do anything in her power to assure the man she is pursuing that she can be hisgirl including make him think those \\"naughty\\" thoughts.  \\"I wish You knew\\" another Jimmy Jam track, is classic because of the live feeling added to it. Mariah has a cheering audience and engages in some dialogue with them. She's shrieking in full force on this song and while at sometimes it feels a bit over the top she manages to pull it off. The song is very retro and again the lyrics are pleasant and listenable. After all if Beyonce can get song writing props for writing \\"And I won't diss you on the internet, cuz my mama taught me better than that\\" (from \\"Survivor\\") than Mariah can definitely receive some for the bulk of the songs on \\"Emancipation\\". \\"To The Floor\\" featuring Nelly is the last of the uptempo tracks and another attempt by Mariah to make a dance friendly club track. While the track isn't a total miss the production is a little stale and the song lacks a memorable chorus. Nelly's flow is nice however it does little to revive the otherwise passable track. <br /> <br />Mariah closes the album with two ballads. \\"Joy Ride\\" is a soft whispery jam that finds Mariah singing in one of her lower registers throughout the song while bursting into that glass shattering note at the end. Mariah is on a natural high in this song over the joy she has found with her latest love. Nothing could ever replace her love and he's all she needs because together they can \\"touch the stars above\\" because their love is heavent sent. I wouldn't classify \\"Joy Ride\\" as album filler but it's not one of the standout tracks on this album. The gospel tinged \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" finishes off the album for Mariah, who ask the big guy upstairs to carry her higher because of the tough times she is going through. The song is infused with the soul and passion expected on a gospel number and Mariah sings through this song with grace and ease never making her voice sound forced. Her plea to God is surprisingly convincing aided by the choir in the backround and the beating drums.  <br /> <br />\\"TheEmancipation of Mimi\\" doesn't offer anything groundbreaking in Mariahs career however it's a consistent and well crafted pop-R&B album and her best to come out since the other emancipation she went through that we called \\"Butterfly\\".  Ms. Carey doesn't have to blaze trails or break boundaries at this stage in her career, because she's already done that with her ballads, and hip hop and dance remixes. Her vocal  influence is written all over todays up and coming divas such as Christina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson as well as every contestant on American Idol. If anything \\"Mimi\\" is a testament to longevity. After 15 years in the industry the best selling female artist of all time has prooved hat no matter what the hot trends are in music or whose on top (sorry J. Lo) a true talent such as Mariah can pair with the hot producers of today and put out quality material all while writing her own songs and holding an amazing note. <br /> <br />
B000000OAN|5.0|From someone who had only heard the greatest hits album, i was pleasantly surprised by this. Some underrated songs on here like \\"Death on Two Legs\\" and \\"39\\".
B00070Q7VO|2.0|There is simply no reason for this album to exist.  It will be all over the bargain bins within a year.  There is no added spark or anything but by-the-numbers arrangements-- it sometimes sounds like parody.  Who will seek this stuff out in 5 years?  No one.  Buy the originals instead.  Unless you like imitation swing like Rod Stewart-- then this is for you.  If you'd like to hear Beatles songs with a jazz/swing twist, listen to John Pizzarelli Meets the Beatles.
0312995423|2.0|This book is exciting to read and fast paced, although I found the dialog between the characters to be a little flat. That is not a criticism however as this is meant to be a thriller.<br /><br />Problem with this book is that anyone with a background in cryptography or having studied computer sciencde will notice plenty of technical errors for example saying that a 64 bit key has 64 characters (ok yes binary characters).<br /><br />Other improbabilities are a 2BN machine that is cooled by a freon system that does not have an interlock to shut the machine down if the cooling should fail. You get those kind of interlocks on your $40 microwave door switch.<br /><br />Anyway, overall still a fun read.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Alright I own and love all three Avenged Sevenfold cd's(sounding the seventh trumpet,Waking The Fallen and City Of Evil) but this is definently the best one of the three. Front-Man  Matt Shadows voice is better on this CD only because he had surgery and is singing higher on \\"City Of Evil\\" the riffs of Lead Guitar Synester Gates and Rythm of Zachy Vengeance rock every CD on the shelves and drummer The Reverand adds excellent rythm to the songs along with bass player johnny Christ. This band has among the most talented memebers i have ever listend to in life. <br /> <br />1.Waking the Fallen-8/10 (excellent opening to the cd) <br /> <br />2.Unholy Confessions-8/10(good song) <br /> <br />3.Chapter Four-9/10(excellent song to have after \\"unholy Confessions\\" <br /> <br />4.Remenissions-9.5/10 (Great Song,One of the best) <br /> <br />5.Desecrate Through Reverance-8.5/10  <br /> <br />6.Eternal Rest-9/10(excellent Chorus)  <br /> <br />7.Second Heartbeat-9/10(One of the best on the CD) <br /> <br />8.Radiant Eclipse-9/10  <br /> <br />9.I Won't See You Tonight Pt.-10/10(Excellent Slow Song Great Lyrics) <br /> <br />10.I Won't See You Tonight Pt.2-10/10(Bets Follow Up To A Song Ever  <br /> <br />11.Clairvoyant Disease-8.5/10(Another Great Slower Song) <br /> <br />12.And All Things Will End-9/10(would be 10 but the solo at the end gets annoying but is great nonetheless
B000001EUL|5.0|I discovered this masterpiece by accident when a friend left his cassette at my place for a few days some 25 years ago and I haven't stopped being awed since. The first song I heard from it was \\"Can't Get Enough\\" and I can't.Any album that has both Michael and Matthias is automatically great! I was fortunate enough to speak to Klaus and Matthias on \\"Rockline\\" Oct/'04 and asked about the title for the album and yes of course Lovedrive is a play on words,Klaus even takes credit for being the first to substitute the word Love for sex that is commonly used today.Every song has a great flow and leads perfectly to the next.Don Dokken called it the perfect album and I agree,their best in a long line of great albums!
